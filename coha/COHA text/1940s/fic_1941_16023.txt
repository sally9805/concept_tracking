THE HILL FARM OF JABEZ STONE The hill farm of Jabez Stone , in New Hampshire , some miles from the village of Cross Corners , around 1840 . It is a poor farm , stony and stingy with its favors . The house is small , simple , bare . A wide view of the JABEZ STONE FARM on a Sunday morning fades in , and it is seen squatting down under the muddy , showery skies of a cold New Hampshire spring . The grip of winter is broken  --  the ground runs with water . The air is still cold but the sun is warm at noon . It 's a cold spring , but liveness has begun to come back to the earth . It is n't depressing weather  --  exciting rather  --  for after months of snow and ice , there is going to be warmth and light , though not quite yet . But they 're in the air  --  on the way . Over this scene comes the sound of distant church bells , ringing faintly from the village of Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his late twenties , gets a rather discouraged-looking horse hitched to a rattle-trap buggy . &nbsp; JABEZMary ! Ma ! All ready ? First bell 's a-ringing . Ma Stone , a brisk old woman , Jabez 's mother , bustles to the door , which stands open . She wears her best Sunday-go-to-meeting clothes and is adjusting her bonnet , tying the strings under her chin with nervous fingers . &nbsp; MA STONEYes , we 're all ready . Mary 's just coming down . She comes out on the porch . She has a tart tongue and knows how to use it , but when she talks to her son or her daughter-in-law , there is affection under the tartness . &nbsp; MA STONE ( helping him into his coat ) Now , son . Cheer up . We 're all healthy . We 've still got meal in the barrel . And look at that sky . . . ( pointing out ) . . . big cracks in it like it was ice on the mill pond cracking up to show it 's spring a-coming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , I want to know . And Ma Stone climbs up to the seat of the buggy , Jabez on her side to help her . Now Mary appears at the door , also dressed for church . She is four or five  --  3  --  years younger than Jabez , small , appealing , with rather fine features . She looks more fragile than she is . It is obvious that she and Jabez are very much in love . &nbsp; MARY ( seeing the pool of mud in her way , stops and calls ) Jabez  --  help ! &nbsp; JABEZComing . He rushes from the buggy to help . The dog , Shep , a ragged shepherd , appears from below the hill , running with a stick in his mouth . He jumps up against Jabez 's leg , wiping his mud-caked paws on him . &nbsp; JABEZDown , Shep ! Down ! &nbsp; MARYHe only wants you to throw the stick for him , Jabez . I guess he 's feeling the spring a-coming , too . &nbsp; JABEZAll right  --  only he need n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shep and throws it far off with a mighty swing . Shep runs after it , barking excitedly . Mary , standing on the edge of the porch , follows the soaring stick with her eyes . &nbsp; MARY ( speaking with pride ) You throw mighty far , Jabez  --  almost into the pigsty . &nbsp; MA STONE ( from the buggy ) Mary  --  Jabez  --  &nbsp; MARYComing , Ma . &nbsp; JABEZ ( as he sweeps Mary up in his arms , carrying her to the buggy ) What is that smile on your face ? ( glancing down at his clothes ) Is there anything wrong with me ?  --  4  --  &nbsp; MARYNow , Jabez ! I 've got on my Sunday bonnet and I 'm going to church with my husband . Almost the first time since the beginning of winter  --  and if that is n't an occasion , I do n't know what is . &nbsp; JABEZYou 're right , Mary . &nbsp; MA STONEI hope we wo n't be too late  --  She shifts her position so that Mary can get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then suddenly the squealing of a pig . &nbsp; JABEZNow , what the dickens  --  And we see Shep on the SLOPE COMING FROM THE BARNS , barking excitedly and chasing after a small pig that his barking has scared into a panic . Thereupon , at the STONE HOUSE , Jabez stands up in the buggy . &nbsp; JABEZ ( yelling ) Look at that consarn dog ! Shep ! Stop it ! Shep ! Jabez leaps down from the buggy and heads for the bushes , chasing the pig . Shep runs after him , barking furiously , only making matters worse . And on the SLOPE CUTTING DOWN TO THE GULLY there unfolds a wild scene of Jabez trying to catch the slippery pig . Both man and pig slip through the mud and fall . Once , Jabez almost catches the pig ; grabs frantically for its hind leg , but the pig manages to break away . Finally , the pig slips over some rocks in the gully and falls , hurting its leg . Jabez succeeds in cornering it , helped by Shep who rounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carries the pig back toward the house , his clothes now a sight with mud and wet . At the STONE HOUSE : &nbsp; MA STONEWell , I guess we wo n't be going to church today . &nbsp; MARYI guess we wo n't . Jabez emerges from the gully with the pig , still squealing , in his arms . He comes up panting , the muddy dog following him , looking quite triumphant and not at all guilty . Mary is near . Jabez comes up to her and they stand for a moment looking at each other . &nbsp; JABEZ  --  5  --  ( as the pig squeals ) Quiet , Mr. Porker ! ( laughing , as he struggles to hold it ) He 's worse than a greased pig at the county fair ! They walk into the house as the rain starts . The KITCHEN : It is the largest room in the house and very much the pleasantest . There is a big fireplace with fire in it , crane , pot-hooks , etc . All of the cooking is done here . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall . Jabez and Mary enter . Ma follows . &nbsp; JABEZ ( looking over the pig ) I think his leg is broken . &nbsp; MARY ( taking his wet trousers , hanging them near the fire , and covering his knees with a blanket ) Oh , Jabez . &nbsp; JABEZ ( shaking his head ) Yep . He is fitting a crude splint to the pig 's wounded leg , helped by Mary , who holds the splint while Jabez wraps it tightly with some rags torn from an old shirt . The pig does n't like this a bit , and often protests loudly , in the shrill guttural of pigs . &nbsp; JABEZI remember Dad used to say sometimes , when they were handing out hard luck , the farmers got there first . &nbsp; MARYJabez , do n't you remember your own wedding ? We said it 's for better or worse . We said it 's for richer or poorer . &nbsp; JABEZThat 's what we said . &nbsp; MA STONE ( has taken the Bible and starts leading ) " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Job ; and that man was perfect and upright ,  --  6  --  and one that feared God and eschewed evil . " &nbsp; JABEZ ( as the pig heaves and almost breaks away ) Consarn the consarn  --  &nbsp; MA STONEJabez ! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath ? And me a-reading the holy word ! &nbsp; JABEZSorry , Ma  --  but this consar  --  this little pig  --  He wo n't let me fix him  --  &nbsp; MARY ( smiling ) He 's stubborn as a Stone . &nbsp; JABEZHold the splint tighter  --  it 's almost done . ( As Mary holds the splint tighter ) Go on reading , Ma . This man , Job , he had troubles , did n't he ? &nbsp; MA STONEYou know that , son . &nbsp; JABEZ ( nodding ) Hard luck  --  like me . &nbsp; MA STONE ( severely ) Now , Jabez Stone  --  as for what you 're calling hard luck  --  well , we made New England out of it . That and codfish . &nbsp; JABEZThat 's right , Ma  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licked till he 's dead  --  that 's what Dad used to say , did n't he , Ma ? Ma Stone nods silently . &nbsp; JABEZ ( finishing with the pig ) There ! Guess that ought to hold good . Put him down here , by the fire , Mary . ( moving forward an empty woodbox ) But we do n't want to get him too close  --  we 'll  --  7  --  have roast pork for supper . &nbsp; MA STONE ( with a smile ) Not on the Sabbath you wo n't , Jabez ! &nbsp; MARYGive me the book , Ma ! I 'm going to read us something comforting . Ma hands her the book , and Mary plumps it down on her knee with spirit ; turns the pages ; then remembers and looks up at Ma Stone . &nbsp; MARYThat is  --  if you do n't mind changing the lesson , Ma . &nbsp; MA STONELand sakes , I do n't mind . I never did hold much with Job , even if he is Scripture . He took on too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man , but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts . Yes , Mary , you go ahead and read . As Mary is about to read , there is a dash of rain on the windows , and Shep is heard barking from outside . Holding the blanket around him , Jabez rises and goes to the window . &nbsp; JABEZWell , I 'll be  --  there 's a rig , turning in , by the gate . &nbsp; MARY ( rising and going quickly to the window ) Who is it ? &nbsp; JABEZIt 's Tom Sharp and two other fellers  --  Oh , glory  --  where 's my pants ? He makes a wild scramble for them , grabbing them up from a chair near the fire . The women , in the way of all women , are rushing about , fixing up the kitchen . Shep is heard barking , outside . Outside , a buggy has driven up in the teeming rain and two farmers , their clothes drenched , are climbing down , while a third farmer remains in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The men run for the shelter of the porch , barked at by the dog , who has been curled up by the kitchen door . They reach the door and knock ; one pats the dog and quiets him . Jabez , pulling up  --  8  --  his braces , opens the door . &nbsp; TOM SHARPAfternoon , Mary . &nbsp; MARYAfternoon , Tom . Come in . Tom Sharp starts to come in slowly , followed by his friends . &nbsp; MA STONEThere 's a mat there to wipe your feet on . &nbsp; TOM SHARPThanks , ma'am . Howdy , Jabez . &nbsp; JABEZHowdy , Tom . He wipes his feet vigorously . So does his companion . &nbsp; TOM SHARP ( introducing the second farmer ) This is Van Brooks  --  he 's Massachusetts . Thereupon Ma Stone looks at him with redoubled suspicion . And now the third farmer , the one driving the buggy , stands at the door , stamping his wet feet . &nbsp; TOM SHARPThis is Eli Higgins  --  Vermont . &nbsp; MA STONEThere 's a mat there to wipe your feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each farmer ducks awkwardly as introduced and mutters , " Afternoon , ma'am , " to Mary and Ma Stone . They come over and hold their hands out to the blaze that Mary pokes up . &nbsp; JABEZCome on close to the fire  --  Set down . They sit . &nbsp; VAN BROOKS ( who is nearest to the wood-box ) Little pig hurt himself ?  --  9  --  &nbsp; JABEZYep . The women busy themselves at the cupboard over in one corner , opposite side of the fireplace . The men make themselves comfortable by the fire , as Jabez adds a few logs of wood and again pokes up the coals , but they do not smoke . Eli Higgins gets his pipe out and is about to fill it . &nbsp; MA STONEWe do n't smoke on Sabbath in New Hampshire . &nbsp; ELI HIGGINSSorry , ma'am , I forgot . ( And he puts the pipe away . ) &nbsp; JABEZ ( to Eli Higgins ) How 's the year been in your part of the country ? &nbsp; ELI HIGGINSHad a good stand of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hailstorm  --  in June . Hailstones so mighty chickens sat on ' em thinking they was eggs . Makes you wonder sometimes what Providence is thinking about . &nbsp; VAN BROOKSWe got a snowstorm in August . &nbsp; MARYIn August ? &nbsp; VAN BROOKSYes , and it was so cold  --  a man got caught in it  --  froze him solid , all except his heart . That was frozen already . &nbsp; TOM SHARPLoan shark  --  hey ? &nbsp; JABEZToo bad it did n't happen to Miser Stevens . &nbsp; TOM SHARPAre you one of old Stevens ' customers too ? &nbsp; JABEZSure am.  --  10  --  &nbsp; TOM SHARPYes , it 's the debt and the lien and the mortgage that eats up the farmer ! He stretches out his thin legs ; uses a splinter of wood for a toothpick , pulled from a log near the fire . &nbsp; ELI HIGGINSCity folks , they can go bankrupt  --  a farmer , he ca n't crawl easy . &nbsp; VAN BROOKSLaws ought to be changed , somehow . &nbsp; TOM SHARPYes ! We farmers ought to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a sort of Grange as they call it in Vermont . &nbsp; VAN BROOKSThat 's why the three of us met up together , Neighbor Stone . We 're American citizens  --  we 've got a right to get ourselves organized like city folks . &nbsp; TOM SHARPWhat do you say ? Sound reasonable to you ? &nbsp; JABEZ ( pulling his chin ) Sure does . But I 'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights . &nbsp; TOM SHARPThat 's fair enough , Jabez . Man 's got a right to mull things over . We 'll drive round again , week or so . They get up . &nbsp; JABEZI am just thinkin '  --  now they might n't like the idea down in Washington . &nbsp; TOM SHARPWhy not ! There 's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy . Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now --  &nbsp; JABEZBlack Dan'l ?  --  11  --  &nbsp; VAN BROOKSYep  --  the biggest man in the whole U.S.  --  Senator from Massachusetts  --  and surely our next president . &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the valley  --  Mary is from there , too . &nbsp; MARY ( leaping in  --  flushed with excitement ) He gave my father advice , many times  --  about crops and politics  --  and it was always right . &nbsp; TOM SHARPI 've heard people talk a lot about his farm at Marshfield . He 's up at five there every morning . He ai n't one of our gentleman farmers . He knows all the ways of the land . &nbsp; ELI HIGGINSThey say , when he goes out to fish , the trout jump out of the stream and right into his pockets , because they know it 's no use arguing . &nbsp; JABEZWhy , they say that when he speaks , stars and stripes come right out in the sky . . . . Section Details THE SCENE DISSOLVES INTO WEBSTER 'S STUDY AT NIGHT The scene dissolves into WEBSTER 'S STUDY at night . Daniel Webster is seated at his desk writing a speech . A table lamp lights his face , leaving the rest of the room in darkness . On the wall behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF SCRATCHListen , Black Dan'l , You 're wasting your time writing speeches like that . Why worry about the people and their problems ? Start thinking of your own . You want to be president of this country , do n't you  --  and you ought to be  --  ( continues dreamily )  --  Inauguration Day parade  --  bands playing  --  horses prancing , the sun shining on the stars and stripes waving in the breeze  --  crowds cheering Daniel Webster , President of the United States of America . . . . ( more briskly ) Do n't be a fool . Stop bothering with that speech and get busy promoting yourself instead of the people .  --  12  --  Webster at this point grabs the inkwell and throws it at the shadow on the wall . The shadow disappears , and Webster turns back looking over his speech . Then the SPEECH IN WEBSTER 'S HANDWRITING appears on the screen . " I would say to every man who follows his own plough , and to every mechanic , artisan , and laborer in every city in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who wishes by honest means to gain an honest living , Beware of wolves in sheep 's clothing ! " This dissolves to a series of views , montage shots , of a group in a village square : of men and women , farmer types , reading a copy of Webster 's speech , headed " Webster Pleads for Farm Rights in Bankruptcy Bill . " &nbsp; FARMER ( reading ) " The insolvent farmers can not even come to the seat of their Government to present their cases to Congress  --  so great is their fear that some creditor will arrest them in some intervening state  --  " This dissolves to a field , revealing a farmer reading from the same speech , with his wife and son . It is day . &nbsp; FARMER ( reading ) " We talk much and talk warmly of political liberty , but who can enjoy political liberty if he is deprived permanently of personal liberty ? To those unfortunate individuals doomed to the everlasting bondage of debt , what is it that we have free institutions of Government ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , revealing Jabez , dressed to go to town , seated by the small table , glancing over Daniel Webster 's speech copied in the " Cross Corners Gazette . " The Sheriff is looking over Jabez 's shoulder . On the other side of the table is Mary . On the table is the cracked teapot in which they have hoarded their small savings . Mary is counting the money . &nbsp; JABEZ ( reading from the paper  --  Webster 's speech ) " . . . and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress , can we  --  members of the Government  --  go to our beds  --  13  --  with a clear conscience , can we , without self-reproach , supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors ? &nbsp; MARYThat 's wonderful language . It would move a stone . &nbsp; JABEZIf it would only move old Miser Stevens  --  We 've still got to pay him . &nbsp; SHERIFFYep  --  you ca n't get around that mortgage .  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sheriff . &nbsp; SHERIFFWish I could really do something for you . But you know Stevens . He 'll throw you off your farm tomorrow if you do n't pay him tonight . &nbsp; JABEZLet him try it . &nbsp; SHERIFFThe law is the law . Good-bye , Mary . &nbsp; MARYGoodbye , Sheriff . The Sheriff leaves . &nbsp; JABEZWell  --  what are we going to do ? &nbsp; MARYWe can still use my butter money . &nbsp; JABEZYour butter money ? &nbsp; MARYDo you think I 'm grudging it ? &nbsp; JABEZMary  --  it 's gone . &nbsp; MARY  --  14  --  Not all of it ? &nbsp; JABEZYes  --  I had to pay the vet in full . He just would n't have treated the horse this time . After all , we ca n't very well do without a horse . &nbsp; MARYIt 's all right , Jabez . We 'll find something to pay Stevens . &nbsp; JABEZIf the pig had n't broke his leg , we could have taken him . &nbsp; MARYJabez ! Could n't you take a sack of seed instead ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring plowing ? &nbsp; MARYYou always said , the field uphill needs a rest , but if you think  --  &nbsp; JABEZMary , I 'm a farmer  --  always will be . To me seed is n't a thing to pay debts with , it 's alive , more alive than anything  --  but I guess you 're right . We just got to do it . Oh  --  how 's it all going to end ? &nbsp; MARYJabez  --  you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange . &nbsp; JABEZI will , Mary  --  always thought a man could be stronger alone  --  seems I 've been wrong about that . Ma Stone calls from outside . &nbsp; MA STONE 'S VOICEJabez ! You 'll be late ! &nbsp; JABEZ ( calling )  --  15  --  All right , Ma --  He gathers up the worn bills and puts them in the inside pocket of his coat . &nbsp; MARYJust a minute . She runs for the stairs that lead to the bedrooms . The SIDE PORCH OF THE KITCHEN : The wagon stands , already hitched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the long-legged skittery stage , is being held by Ma Stone by a piece of rope around its neck . It is extremely nervous , anticipating a drastic change , and jumps about a good deal , tugging at the rope . As Jabez comes out from the house , Ma Stone is jerking at the rope , trying to make the calf quiet down . &nbsp; JABEZHow 'd you know to have the calf ready , Ma ? &nbsp; MA STONEI just figgered  --  knew you did n't have enough bills . &nbsp; JABEZYes  --  and you figgered right , consarn it ! &nbsp; MA STONE ( disapprovingly ) That 's a word you 're too free with lately , Jabez , consarn this and consarn that . . . &nbsp; JABEZHelps sometimes to say it . &nbsp; MA STONE ( with understanding ) All right , son  --  if it helps . Mary comes out of the house . She holds a scarf in her hand . &nbsp; MARY ( as she sees the calf ) Jabez ! &nbsp; JABEZSeed alone wo n't do , Mary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( very much disappointed ) Oh Jabez ! And we were counting on . . .  --  16  --  ( stopping ) It 's a lovely calf . &nbsp; JABEZ ( still glum ) You 're right , Mary it 's a fine calf . That 's why Stevens 'll take it for the rest of the payment . He sighs and starts to get the calf up on the wagon , and Mary climbs up on the wagon to help . At this moment the horse moves , Mary loses her balance , and falls over backward from the wagon . Jabez rushes over to her . &nbsp; JABEZMary  --  are you hurt ? Mary is unconscious and does n't answer . &nbsp; MA STONEShe hit her head  --  Carry her in the house . He lifts her up , carrying her into the house . The KITCHEN : Jabez puts Mary into a chair . &nbsp; MA STONEFetch some water  --  quick ! Jabez rushes out to the pump while Ma tends to Mary . The YARD : As Jabez comes out of the house with a bucket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seen by the corner of the house , his muzzle raised to the sky , howling dismally and strangely . &nbsp; JABEZKeep quiet , Shep . He continues on the way to the well to fill the bucket , but Shep howls again . &nbsp; MA STONE ( calling from the kitchen door ) What 's ailing that dog ? &nbsp; JABEZ ( at the well ) I du n no . &nbsp; MA STONEWell . . . make him keep quiet . &nbsp; JABEZAnd why should I ? Let him howl if it makes him  --  17  --  feel good . ( with a sudden rush of bitterness ) Consarn it . He 's better off than I am ! I wish I could tell Him . . . ( with an angry motion up to the sky ) . . . up there , just what I think . &nbsp; MA STONEHush up such talk , Jabez ! &nbsp; JABEZI ca n't help it . I mean it , I tell you . I 've had more than my share . Nothing ever goes right for me  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . The KITCHEN : Jabez , enters with the bucket of water , and sets it down . &nbsp; JABEZ ( bending over Mary , tenderly ) Mary --  &nbsp; MARY ( coming out of her faint ) Jabez . . . &nbsp; JABEZMary  --  how do you feel ? &nbsp; MA STONELet her be , son . She 'll do all right . You better get yourself straightened out . &nbsp; MARY ( weakly ) Yes , Jabez  --  do n't worry . &nbsp; JABEZI 'll get the doctor . &nbsp; MARYNo , Jabez  --  all I need is some rest  --  You go and pay our debt . Everything 'll be all right then . . . everything . Mary 's eyes close and she sinks into sleep , while Jabez leaves for the barn . The BARN : Jabez takes a sack of seed , throws it on his shoulder . At this moment the sack opens and all the seed runs out into a dirty pool of water .  --  18  --  &nbsp; JABEZThat 's enough to make a man sell his soul to the devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents ! He stops abruptly , realizing what he has said and appalled by it . He looks around him , fearfully . &nbsp; JABEZI guess nobody heard . I hope not . Jabez jams his hands in his pockets and a horrified expression comes over his face . He slowly takes out his right hand . In the palm are two big copper pennies . &nbsp; A VOICE ( speaking smoothly ) Good evening , Neighbor Stone . Jabez turns around and sees a figure  --  well-dressed , looking rather like a salesman . Jabez stares at him , speechless . &nbsp; THE VOICEMy name is Scratch  --  I often go by that name in New England . &nbsp; JABEZI do n't want to have any business with you . &nbsp; SCRATCHDo you deny that you called me ? I 've known people in other States who went back on their word . But I did n't expect it in New Hampshire . &nbsp; JABEZ ( stung ) You ca n't say that to me ! I 'm New Hampshire . If I say I called you , I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . &nbsp; SCRATCHYou 've had a lot of bad luck these days . And yet  --  it 's all so unnecessary . When I think of your opportunities  --  &nbsp; JABEZOpportunities ? &nbsp; SCRATCHOf course . Why man , you have one of the richest  --  19  --  farms in the county . ( as Jabez laughs bitterly , Scratch persists ) You just go about it the wrong way  --  so many men do . Hard work  --  well , that 's all right for people who do n't know how to do anything else . It 's all right for people who are n't lucky  --  but once you 're lucky  --  you do n't work for other people . You make them work for you . &nbsp; JABEZWell , now , Mister , that sounds all right . But --  &nbsp; SCRATCHA clever man like yourself  --  he can find money anywhere . Money to pay his bills  --  money for his wife and his children  --  money to be a rich man . All he needs is a friend to point it out to him . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barn ) Like that ! The board , rotten , gives way . Underneath it is an iron pot , filled with money . Scratch points down to it silently ; Jabez looks at it , dumbfounded . &nbsp; SCRATCHDo n't be afraid of it . Pick it up . Feel it in your hands . &nbsp; SHARP 'S VOICE ( from outside ) Jabez Stone ! Jabez does n't hear . He still stares at the gold . &nbsp; SCRATCHSomeone 's calling you , Mr. Stone . Jabez looks up bewildered . &nbsp; ANOTHER VOICE FROM OUTSIDEJabez Stone ! Jabez runs across the barn to the other door . Tom Sharp , Eli Higgins and Van Brooks are approaching , and Jabez stops them in the doorway . &nbsp; JABEZ ( breathless ) What do you want ?  --  20  --  &nbsp; TOM SHARPHowdy , Mr. Stone . We 've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange ? &nbsp; JABEZ ( in a daze ) What Grange ? &nbsp; TOM SHARPThat farmers ' association  --  we were talking about the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to mull it over , proper . &nbsp; JABEZ ( interrupting ) No , no I do n't want to join ! ( harshly ) Go away  --  leave me alone . &nbsp; TOM SHARP ( retreating ) Well  --  we do n't mean to force you , Jabez Stone  --  but  --  it 's only for your own good . &nbsp; JABEZI 'll look out for myself ! . . . Now go away  --  leave me alone . He stands for a moment looking after them as they turn and leave . Then he quickly rushes back to Scratch . &nbsp; JABEZ ( looking at the gold ) Where did it come from ? &nbsp; SCRATCHOh , you know the old story  --  the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga . Some of the gold has been buried under your barn ! &nbsp; JABEZ ( feverishly ) Yes , why should n't it ? &nbsp; SCRATCHYes , of course , people forgot  --  or the men who knew about it died , you know how these things  --  21  --  happen . Jabez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . &nbsp; JABEZIt 's mine ? &nbsp; SCRATCHThat 's right , Mr. Stone  --  there is  --  ( whipping a paper from his pocket )  --  just one little formality . I 'd like your signature here  --  see . And when it 's done  --  it 's done for seven years . ( as Jabez looks up ) It 's our usual form . Of course  --  we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time . &nbsp; JABEZ ( staring at the paper Scratch holds before him ) What does it mean here  --  about my soul ? &nbsp; SCRATCHWell , why should that worry you . A soul  --  a soul is nothing . Can you see it , smell it , touch it ?  --  No !  --  Think of it  --  this soul  --  your soul  --  a nothing , against seven whole years of good luck ! You will have money and all that money can buy . Upon my word , Neighbor Stone , if it were n't for my firm 's reputation for generous dealing --  He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ! Give it to me ! &nbsp; SCRATCH ( taking a pin from his coat lapel ) A pin , Neighbor Stone ! I 'm afraid , you 'll have to prick your finger  --  but what 's a little pain to a lucky man ? Jabez takes the pin , pricks his finger and draws blood . &nbsp; SCRATCH ( pointing ) Sign here . Jabez signs .  --  22  --  &nbsp; SCRATCHExcellent . A firm , fair signature . One that will last till doomsday . ( tucking the deed away in his pocketbook , then shaking Jabez 's hand ) My dear Neighbor Stone , I congratulate you ! You 're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire ! ( He starts to leave . ) &nbsp; JABEZWell , I 'll be  --  ( He stoops to pick up some gold . ) &nbsp; SCRATCHYes , indeed . But not now . Not for seven years . Oh , I almost forgot  --  what is the date ? &nbsp; JABEZThe seventh day of April  --  &nbsp; SCRATCH1840 . Well , that 'll take us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the door together . OUTSIDE THE BARN , the sunset fading from the sky : Jabez and Scratch stand by a stunted tree near the door . &nbsp; SCRATCHJust to remind you  --  though of course we 'll be seeing each other in the interim  --  He sweeps his five , very pointed fingers across the bark of the tree and suddenly there is a date upon it : " APRIL 7 , 1847 . " Scratch moves toward his black buggy and black horse . They are just shadows in the weird light . &nbsp; SCRATCH ( lifting his hat ) Good evening , Neighbor Stone . ( he gets into the buggy ) A beautiful sunset , Mr. Stone . Jabez stands with the gold in his hands as we hear the buggy wheels drive away , but we hardly can see it disappear ; it becomes part of the twilight so quickly . Jabez , left alone , blinks as though waking from a fantastic dream . He looks  --  23  --  down at the gold in his hands ; and he brings a piece of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . &nbsp; JABEZ ( in a low voice ) Mary . . . . ( the realization of his luck coming over him in a wave ) Mary . . . Mary . . . Mary ! He rushes for the house . The dog , Shep , slinks out of the hall and follows Jabez , suddenly shaking off his fears and prancing by his master 's side . The KITCHEN in Jabez Stone 's House : The lamps are lit . Mary is propped up in a chair by the fire , and Ma Stone is busy with supper . Jabez rushes over to Mary , so excited he can not sit down . He tosses the gold pieces in Mary 's lap . She is fingering them , amazed  --  incredulous . &nbsp; JABEZMary  --  what would you do with a pot o ' gold ? &nbsp; MARYJabez ! &nbsp; JABEZMary  --  what would you do ? &nbsp; MARYWell  --  I  --  I do n't know  --  I would pay our debts and well  --  maybe get a new bonnet , but  --  really  --  I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Hessian gold . I found it in the barn . &nbsp; MA STONEYou found it in the barn , hey ? &nbsp; JABEZYes  --  I was getting the seed  --  I stumbled  --  I saw one of the boards warped up a bit  --  and  --  there it was . &nbsp; MA STONE ( skeptically as she carries plates to the table ) Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell . ( as she thumps plates down on table ) Do n't seem right , somehow !  --  24  --  &nbsp; JABEZBut it 's true . Take ' em up in your hands , Mary  --  feel ' em  --  they 're real all right . ( as Mary just stares at her lap , but does not touch the money ) Are n't you glad ? &nbsp; MARYI 'll try hard  --  I just ca n't take it all in . &nbsp; MA STONE ( taking up one of the gold pieces ) H 'm . Hessian gold . Well  --  hope it 'll do us more good than it did the Hessians . She drops it . &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ma . We 're rich ! He stoops down and kisses Mary . &nbsp; MA STONE ( at the fire ) Well  --  that 's comforting ! ( lifting the pot from the crane and starting back toward the table with it ) Supper . &nbsp; JABEZSay , Mary , how is your shoulder ? &nbsp; MARYIt feels fine now , Jabez . &nbsp; JABEZWill you come into town with me tomorrow ? &nbsp; MARYI 'd love to . The scene fades out . &nbsp; pp. 25-41 A ROAD A ROAD fades in . It is next morning and a bright spring day and Jabez and Mary , both dressed for town , are riding in the buggy , en route to Cross Corners . As we follow them , Jabez is in high spirits , he is humming or whistling a little tune ; Mary is , too , but with more reserve . This view dissolves to CROSS CORNERS , MISER STEVENS ' OFFICE , later in the  --  25  --  day : The buggy stops in a whirl of dust , and as Jabez jumps out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; JABEZHello , Sheriff . &nbsp; SHERIFFHello , Jabez  --  I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment . &nbsp; JABEZ ( laughing ) And you did n't get it , hey ? Come on , we 'll have another talk with him . Jabez takes the Sheriff 's arm and goes over to the office with him . As Jabez disappears through Stevens ' door he turns and signals reassuringly to Mary and gives her an elaborate wink . STEVENS ' OFFICE : It is a bare , cold room with a small iron stove near the desk , a small iron safe , and a few severe chairs . A meager fire burns in the stove , no more than a few coals . Stevens is behind his desk , with various legal papers piled in front of him , and is looking craftily at the door from the street as it opens and the Sheriff enters , followed by Jabez . &nbsp; JABEZ ( closing the door and stepping forward jauntily , as he mockingly sweeps off his hat ) Stevens ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got the money ? &nbsp; JABEZ ( with mock humility ) I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you . I thought if I made a kind of part payment  --  &nbsp; STEVENS ( hard as granite ) No , Stone ! &nbsp; JABEZ --  in gold . &nbsp; STEVENS ( scornfully ) I 'd like to know where you 'd get it . . . .  --  26  --  &nbsp; JABEZYou know  --  some folks are just lucky . Others pick gold right out of the air . ( reaching up over his head , as though picking it from the air , and flinging a gold piece on the desk ) Like that ! &nbsp; STEVENS ( grabbing for the gold piece as it rolls on the desk and biting it ) Real ! Sheriff , you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily , and while it does not satisfy the mortgage , it has become my property . &nbsp; JABEZDoes n't satisfy , eh ? Well  --  that 's too bad . . . . He does another sly bit of hocus-pocus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' nose , and flings that one down . &nbsp; JABEZRake that one in , too . . . . ( flinging it down ) And this one  --  and this one  --  and that . . . He takes them out now , faster and faster flinging them down one after the other and laughing uproariously as Stevens scrambles for them . &nbsp; JABEZ ( stepping close to the desk ) Count it  --  count it ! The Sheriff 's here to witness . He reaches out suddenly and grabs up a deed from Steven 's desk . He glances at it ; makes sure it is his ; and deliberately tears it into bits and flings them down on the desk . &nbsp; JABEZThat makes everything clean now . Come on , Sheriff . He links arms with the Sheriff and goes out , leaving Stevens staring at one of the pieces of gold as he holds it on his wrinkled palm . He lets it fall to the desk , suddenly realizing he has seen that kind of gold before . With a motion of repulsion , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his desk with a thrust of his trembling hand , and stares down on something that is written there .  --  27  --  There follows a close view ( an insertion ) of what Stevens sees : It is the present date : April 8 , 1840 , written in the same style of lettering Scratch used on the tree on Jabez 's farm . Then , the previous scene reappearing , we watch Stevens staring at it for a moment , then rising rather unsteadily and going quickly to his small iron safe . He opens it ; snatches out some gold and some fat bundles of worn bills , and stuffing them into his pockets , leaves . The scene dissolves to the EXTERIOR OF THE CHURCH AT CROSS CORNERS , a fine white New England structure opposite the village green . Stevens comes up the front steps , hurrying up , clutching his pockets , heavy with their burden of gold and currency , enters the VESTIBULE of the church , which now appears . It is a shadowy corner where there is a poor box or box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money into the box . As he is thus engaged , a shadowy figure in a black frock coat appears in the doorway ; starts to put his sharp-pointed foot over the threshold ; then draws it back . He does not enter the church but speaks from the outside . &nbsp; SCRATCH ( softly ) What are you doing , Mister Stevens ? Stevens whirls about . He stands trembling , his head thrust forward . &nbsp; STEVENS ( stopping and cringing ) I wanted to give it all to the church . &nbsp; SCRATCHMy money ? Why , Mister Stevens ? What a quaint idea . Come over to the door . I want to speak to you privately . Stop throwing away that money . We must n't let people see any softness in you , Mister Stevens . . . . People take advantage of softness , you know . Come out of there  --  I 'll give you an extension if you 'll forget this stupid repentance idea . &nbsp; STEVENS ( coming out of the church ) That is n't it . It 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loneliness ! &nbsp; SCRATCH ( stroking his pointed chin and chuckling softly ) The loneliness ? Lonely with all your gold , Mister Stevens ? That hardly makes sense .  --  28  --  &nbsp; STEVENS ( under his breath ) I want someone to talk to . . . &nbsp; SCRATCHYou can talk to me . . . &nbsp; STEVENSNo , no . . . ( beginning to whimper again ) I want to talk to men . . . to people in Cross Corners . . . to my neighbors . . . &nbsp; SCRATCHWhy do n't you ? &nbsp; STEVENSI ca n't be honest with them . &nbsp; SCRATCHOh , that 's what you want  --  well , you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone  --  now . Section Details THE SCENE DISSOLVES TO THE COUNTRY STORE OF CROSS CORNERS The scene dissolves to the COUNTRY STORE of Cross Corners , disclosing Jabez loading various things he has purchased on his buggy . Eddie , the store clerk , is coming out of the store with Jabez 's bill in his hand . &nbsp; EDDIEThat certainly was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; JABEZ ( paying the bill ) Here . . . ( handing Eddie an extra gold piece ) . . . and this one is for you . &nbsp; EDDIEGolly , Mr. Stone , I hope I stumble on a pot of Hessian gold one day , myself . As Eddie runs back into the store , Mary comes out , accompanied by Sarah . &nbsp; MARY ( indicating the bonnet ) What do you think of that , Jabez ? &nbsp; JABEZLooks right elegant , Mary .  --  29  --  &nbsp; SARAH ( fluttering around her ) Newest thing by last fall catalogue and " Godey 's Ladies ' Book . " &nbsp; MARYYou do n't think it looks too fancy ? &nbsp; JABEZDid you say too fancy ? &nbsp; SARAHLan 's to gracious , child , not for you ! &nbsp; JABEZYou take it  --  nothing 's too fancy for us . . . &nbsp; MARY ( to Sarah ) Well  --  maybe it would n't hurt  --  to have a few roses . &nbsp; SARAH ( smiling ) Right pretty , Mary . &nbsp; MARY ( turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little shawl for Ma  --  good and serviceable . &nbsp; JABEZ ( calling after her ) Take your time , Mary . I 'll be back in half an hour . Jabez leaves , and as Mary turns back she bumps into Eddie who is coming out of the store with a trumpet under his arm . &nbsp; MARYWhere are you going with your trumpet ? &nbsp; EDDIEDid n't you hear , Mrs. Stone ? Daniel Webster has promised to stop at Cross Corners today on his way to Franklin . &nbsp; MARYDaniel Webster  --  here ? &nbsp; EDDIE  --  30  --  Are n't you going to the reception ? Section Details THE SCENE DISSOLVES TO THE VILLAGE SQUARE IN THE LATE AFTERNOON The scene dissolves to the VILLAGE SQUARE in the late afternoon : The whole village has collected here and we see quite a gathering . The local fife-and-drum corps is prominently in evidence , including at least one Revolutionary veteran , in buff and blue , with a pigtail . The Sheriff lines up the band and the spectators ; the schoolmaster takes care of the children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Eddie who practices on his trumpet . &nbsp; SQUIREEddie  --  must you do that now ? &nbsp; EDDIEI want to get it right once before Mr. Webster arrives . &nbsp; SHERIFF ( joining them ) What do you think , Mr. Squire , shall I find out more about Jabez and his gold ? &nbsp; SQUIREYou better find out about Mr. Webster  --  he is already more than an hour late  --  ca n't understand it . He turns to the waiting crowd which is getting restless . He is almost about to speak when Eddie blows his trumpet again , causing the Squire to look at him exasperated . &nbsp; EDDIEDo n't worry , Mr. Squire , I 'll get it yet . &nbsp; SQUIREFriends , neighbors  --  I beg you to have a little more patience . So let 's rehearse the parade once more . He turns to the bandleader , who gives the signal , whereupon the band starts playing . The scene dissolves to a FIELD BEHIND THE BARN in the late afternoon , as Jabez arrives at the blacksmith 's . &nbsp; JABEZ ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOYHe 's pitching horseshoes with Daniel Webster .  --  31  --  &nbsp; JABEZWith whom ? As Jabez turns , we see Daniel Webster and the blacksmith pitching horseshoes . Small boys stand about , watching and cheering . &nbsp; SPECTATOR ( to his companion ) Crazy galoot  --  thinking he can take on Dan'l Webster . &nbsp; ANOTHER FARMERDan'l pitched shoes from his cradle , did n't you , Dan'l ? &nbsp; WEBSTERYes , with my Granny , and she was n't bad , either  --  Now , I 'll really have to go . The people must be waiting over at Cross Corners . Webster has reached his buggy and there Scratch is holding up Webster 's coat . &nbsp; SCRATCHIt 's only a short drive , Mr. Webster . &nbsp; WEBSTER ( turning ) Oh  --  it 's you again . What do you want ? &nbsp; SCRATCHWith the presidential election coming up , I thought I could be of some help , sir . &nbsp; WEBSTERI 'd rather see you on the side of the opposition . &nbsp; SCRATCHI 'll be there , too ! Just then Webster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horseshoe . &nbsp; WEBSTERSay , that 's pretty good , young man . &nbsp; SCRATCHPretty good  --  that 's perfect ! &nbsp; JABEZTen throws  --  Mr. Webster ?  --  32  --  &nbsp; WEBSTERTen throws it is . The scene dissolves and reappears , indicating that some time has elapsed . A few more throws and Jabez has won the game . The farmers cheer . &nbsp; WEBSTER ( Shaking Jabez 's hand ; very friendly ) You win . Will you ride to the village with me , Mr. Stone ? &nbsp; JABEZThank you , Mr. Webster . Section Details THE SCENE DISSOLVES TO THE VILLAGE SQUARE The scene dissolves to the VILLAGE SQUARE , and as Webster drives his buggy down the slope , we suddenly see that the village square is empty  --  not a soul is in sight . The people had apparently become tired of waiting for Webster and gone about their various duties . And now in WEBSTER 'S BUGGY , as two buggies come down the slope , we see the amazed and then chagrined faces of the reception committee as they observe the deserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashing their lightning of humor to the Squire at his side ) I do n't seem to be so very popular after all  --  in Cross Corners . &nbsp; JABEZSeems like it 's my fault , Mr. Webster . &nbsp; WEBSTER ( slapping his knee ) Not at all , lad  --  not at all . ( with tongue in cheek ) For a good game of horseshoes I would always sacrifice fame and acclaim . Some boys jump off the rear of the buggy and dart away , calling out as they run in their shrill , piping voices . &nbsp; MARTIN ( one of the boys ; running up to the door of the inn ) Black Dan'l 's here ! The INN , which now appears , is filled with farmers and town people who were seen before waiting in the Square , and heavy drinking is going on as Martin goes up to the bar . &nbsp; MARTIN  --  33  --  Hey , Dan'l Webster 's here ! In the SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE INN , the carriages now come to a stop as the tavern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , red-faced , always a little mellow , rushes out with greetings and a good-sized cup of rum for the great Dan'l Webster , handed to him by Mr. Scratch . The Squire , red-faced , rushes up to the carriage . &nbsp; SQUIREWelcome  --  Mr. Webster  --  welcome in Cross Corners . &nbsp; CY BIBBER ( as he hands up the cup to Webster ) Your good health , sir . &nbsp; WEBSTER ( taking it ) What about my friends  --  let 's all have a drink and a bumper one for the champion  --  Mister Stone ! &nbsp; CY BIBBERRight away , Mr. Webster . He bows and scrapes and is off immediately into the tavern . &nbsp; WEBSTER ( sniffing the cup ) Here 's a man who knows what 's good for Dan'l Webster ! Medford rum ! Ah , a breath of the Promised Land ! ( he tastes it ; and smacks his lips ) To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe , Jabez Stone ! &nbsp; JABEZ ( who in the meantime got his drink ) Thanks , Mr. Webster ! ( lifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States  --  Dan'l Webster ! Cheers , and they all drink . At this moment , however , young Martin , stepping up to the buggy , begins scrutinizing Webster . &nbsp; WEBSTERWhat are you looking for , Colonel ? ( as Martin does n't answer ) What 's your name ?  --  34  --  &nbsp; MARTINMartin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa 's the only Democrat in Cross Corners . He said you had horns and a tall , Mr. Webster , but I ai n't seen ' em yet . &nbsp; WEBSTERWell , Martin , I only wear them in Washington  --  that 's the trouble . But if you ever come down there , I 'll show them to you . &nbsp; MARTIN ( goggle-eyed ) Gee , would you , Mr. Webster ? Honest ? &nbsp; WEBSTEROf course . And you tell your father for me  --  we may be on opposite sides of the fence , but I 'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions . As long as people do that  --  the country 's all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir  --  I guess I do  --  Gee  --  &nbsp; SCRATCHSpeech , Mr. Webster  --  speech  --  Webster , Jabez , and the Squire , Schoolmaster and Sheriff are still drinking , and Cy Bibber is giving another cup to Webster . It is obvious that Webster , in a very pleasant way , is a little under the weather , for he slumps down in the front seat of the buggy , holding the cup a little unsteadily in his hand . Voices in the crowd begin calling : &nbsp; VOICESSpeech , Black Dan'l . Speech ! &nbsp; SQUIREThey 're asking for a speech , Mr. Webster . &nbsp; WEBSTERSpeech ?  --  Oh , no  --  I 'm a little tired , Slossum . And , besides , it 's so pleasant here  --  in the sun . ( he stretches out his legs and settles down on the small of his back ) Your sun and air are very pleasant in Cross Corners .  --  35  --  He smiles and closes his eyes with a deep sigh . &nbsp; SQUIRE ( sputtering )  --  but  --  Mr. Webster  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( to the Squire ) You tell them  --  &nbsp; VOICES ( from the crowd ) Speech , Dan'l Webster ! Speech ! &nbsp; SQUIRE ( helplessly to the Committee ) What are we going to do , Gentlemen ? Suddenly , Jabez , who realizes the state Webster is in , moves away from the buggy ; and jumps up on the tavern steps . He holds up his hands to the crowd . They gradually stop calling and give him their attention . &nbsp; JABEZ ( beginning with a frog in his throat , scared by his own temerity ) Listen , folks  --  Folks , I want to say  --  Folks , I  --  I do n't know much about speechifying  --  ( swallowing dryly )  --  but I feel it my duty  --  There is an expectant silence , and Jabez , still scared , looks out at the crowd and gropes for further words . At this point we get a fairly close view of Mary in the crowd . She is standing next to a tall , thin woman , Susannah Orr . &nbsp; SUSANNAH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him ? Cat got his tongue ? &nbsp; MARYHush up , Susannah . &nbsp; SUSANNAHJabez is a smart farmer . But making tall speeches 's different . Kin he do it ? &nbsp; MARY  --  36  --  Of course he can  --  I mean he never has  --  but  --  Oh , ca n't you keep quiet ! Now we get a close view of Jabez Stone , still standing on the steps of the tavern . &nbsp; JABEZ ( continuing his speech ) Well , folks  --  what I want to say is  --  well , when a man like Dan'l Webster visits us  --  we should n't ask him for a speech  --  it is for us  --  to speak , to tell him that we farmers thank our lucky stars every day in the year for what Dan'l Webster 's done for us . If anybody 's got corn in his crib and hay in his barn , it 's all due to our good neighbor , Dan'l Webster , who stood right up in Congress to protect us from loan sharks by a new law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural Dan'l Webster gets tired . He 's tired of making speeches and just wants a little rest in the sunshine  --  and , folks , if he do n't choose Cross Corner 's sunshine to rest in ! Now that 's mighty fine ! And I want to say this before I quit talking . We 're hoeing corn in Franklin County , all due , like I says , to Dan'l Webster , and we 'll keep on hoeing it till he 's in the White House in Washington  --  where he belongs . Jabez bows and steps down from steps and is rewarded with applause and cheering . Webster has been soundly asleep but now he opens his eyes . He smiles at Jabez and stretches out his open hand . Jabez grips it , looking exalted . &nbsp; WEBSTER ( still a little drowsy ) Eloquent speech , Neighbor Stone  --  could n't have done better myself  --  ( with a sly smile )  --  under the circumstances . ( he squeezes his hand ) Thank you . &nbsp; JABEZMr . Webster  --  I 'd like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be  --  if it is n't little Mary Sampson from Franklin .  --  37  --  &nbsp; MARY ( smiling ) It is . &nbsp; WEBSTER ( putting out his hand to Mary ) You 've got a smart man , Mrs. Stone . Hang onto him . &nbsp; MARY ( as they shake hands )  --  I 'm going to try , Mr. Webster . She blushes ; then pauses . &nbsp; WEBSTERThat 's fine  --  ( then picking up horses ' reins ) Well  --  I 'm getting on to Franklin before night . Good-bye , Mary  --  Good-bye , Jabez  --  God bless both of you  --  Good-bye , everybody and thank you . He raises his hand to the crowd . They begin to cheer . The horses start trotting off . Now , the band in a last minute rush comes and plays a farewell tune for the departing Webster . Webster turns and waves as the crowd goes on cheering . Jabez and Mary stand together , waving good-bye . The STEPS IN FRONT OF THE INN : The Squire and the others are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jabez ? &nbsp; JABEZ ( to Mary ) Shall we ? &nbsp; MARYWe must go on home , Jabez . &nbsp; JABEZYes , Mary . ( with a self-satisfied sigh and stretch ) It 's been a long day . Section Details THE SCENE DISSOLVES TO THE WASHINGTON ARMS TAVERN BARROOM The scene dissolves to the WASHINGTON ARMS TAVERN BARROOM , where we find the Squire , the Sheriff , the Schoolmaster , and a few other men . They have all been drinking heavily , even the host , Cy Bibber , who is not behind the bar where he should be . Instead , in his place is Scratch , smoothly and very  --  38  --  efficiently mixing and serving the drinks . &nbsp; SCRATCHAnother drink , Sheriff ? &nbsp; CY BIBBERI want to make a toast  --  ( holding up cup that Scratch fills again )  --  a toast to Dan'l Webster  --  greatest man  --  in whole United States !

You do n't know ?  --  &nbsp; SQUIREWell , just one more  --  and this is the last one . The scene dissolves to the MAIN STREET OF CROSS CORNERS , dark and silent . The lights are out in the houses . From out of the tavern , their arms locked  --  39  --  together , come the figures of Scratch , the Squire , Sheriff , Cy Bibber and the Schoolmaster . Scratch is in the middle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the dark street . Softly they chant in their mellowed , dulcet tones , as the scene dissolves . &nbsp; ALL OF THEMWe want Jabez Stone !  --  for selectman  --  Jabez Stone ! Jabez Stone ! Section Details JABEZ STONE 'S BEDROOM , A SMALL ROOM UNDER THE SLOPE OF THE EAVES JABEZ STONE 'S BEDROOM , a small room under the slope of the eaves : It is still that night . The lamp is lit . There is a big , fourposter New England bed with a canopy and patchwork quilts . Jabez and Mary are preparing for bed , Mary is finishing braiding her hair and Jabez is taking off his shoes . &nbsp; JABEZ ( still in the dream ) Remember , Mary , how he said it : " Could n't have done better myself , Jabez Stone , " and it was my first speech . I do n't know what came into me , Mary . I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth . &nbsp; MARY ( having said this many times since ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A pause . She finishes with her hair and begins to unbutton her dress . &nbsp; MARYBut I 'm glad to be home again  --  &nbsp; JABEZ ( looking up at her ) Tired ? &nbsp; MARYWorried ! &nbsp; JABEZThere is nothing to worry about now . &nbsp; MARY ( anxiously ) You 'll never change  --  will you ? &nbsp; JABEZMary  --  you just wait and see  --  It 's all  --  just the beginning  --  just the beginning  --  of everything . I 'll be the biggest man in New  --  40  --  Hampshire and you 'll be the wife of the biggest man . But now Shep is barking in the yard . Jabez turns from Mary and goes toward the window to open it , unbuttoning his shirt . We get a close view of Jabez at the window as he opens it and the curtain flutters in the breeze that smells of earth . We see the new moon from Jabez 's angle , just sinking over the sharp hills . &nbsp; JABEZQuiet , Shep  --  ( taking in a deep breath ) It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , Jabez  --  a new moon .

( after another pause ) Come  --  it 's warm in here . The lamp is blown out and the room becomes dark , except for the thin light of the moon . Jabez 's figure is bathed in it for a moment . He turns from the window , just as the unmistakable figure of Scratch is seen , watching from the shadow of a tree , but Jabez has no eyes for him now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure is seen going toward the bed , while Mary is lying under the covers , her face turned to him on the pillow , waiting . &nbsp; JABEZMary  --   --  41  --  &nbsp; MARYJabez  --  He kisses her , then reaches out and touches the very edge of the bed as the scene fades out . pp. 1-24 &nbsp; pp. 42-61 A HILLSIDE FIELD BACK OF THE STONE HOUSE A HILLSIDE FIELD back of the Stone house fades in . It is just before noon next day , and Jabez is doing his spring plowing . The horse is old and so is the plow , but we should get some feeling of the essential strength and beauty of earth here  --  and of Jabez 's real kinship with it  --  his stride across the furrows and the feeling of his feet honestly gripping the good earth . Then a closer view picks out Jabez plowing and now a horn is heard blowing from the house ; it is a horn used to call men in from the fields . Thereupon Jabez stops and goes to the house .

The STONE PARLOR : It is a frigid place , with sparse , unfriendly furniture and a horse-hair memorial to a departed Stone on the wall . The place might well be a marble vault . Jabez ushers the Squire , Sheriff and Schoolmaster into it . They sit down uncomfortably on hard chairs , shivering a bit . &nbsp; JABEZMighty good of you to come out , Squire  --  sparing all this time to  --  ( looking at others suspiciously ) Sheriff , too  --  and Schoolmaster  --  mighty nice . &nbsp; SQUIREAhem  --  Neighbor Stone , we want --  His head is killing him .

Do n't a politician have to be ? &nbsp; SHERIFFIt seems such an obvious candidature to us all . &nbsp; JABEZ ( taking a deep breath ) Very well , folks . I accept . &nbsp; SQUIREGood ! That 's the right New Hampshire stuff ! Now  --  ahem  --  if we could make a little toast to that effect . &nbsp; MARY ( entering with cups on a tray ) Here , Jabez  --  &nbsp; JABEZ ( taking the tray ) Mary ! I 'm  --  Selectman of Cross Corners ! &nbsp; MARY ( looking at him , frightened and as though she has suddenly lost him ) Oh  --  Jabez . She turns and runs from the room . Jabez turns and looks after her . Then he shrugs , turns back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; SQUIRE ( holding up his cup ) To our new Selectman , Jabez Stone !

Their lips pucker up . &nbsp; SHERIFFI 'll be blowed  --  nanny-plum laxative tea ! They all look , bewildered , at Jabez . The KITCHEN : Ma and Mrs. Slossum are looking over a box filled with paper slips  --  recipes . &nbsp; MA STONEAnd if this does n't do it , then you try this recipe . &nbsp; MRS . SLOSSUM  --  45  --  Thank you  --  Ma Stone . &nbsp; MARY ( entering with the tray of empty cups ) Oh , Mrs. Slossum , they are all leaving  --  you better hurry up if you do n't want to stay here .

I do n't want to be idle . &nbsp; JABEZAnd I do n't want to have a washwoman for a wife . &nbsp; MA STONEWell , son , I 'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again . &nbsp; JABEZNow look here , Ma . I 'm not a boy anymore . I want that understood . I do n't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life . Mary 's got to be the kind of wife a  --  a big man needs  --  &nbsp; MARYJabez  --  once you said we 'd never change  --  &nbsp; JABEZI was n't used to being big  --  was n't used to thinking in big ways . Now , I 've made up my mind . He leaves , the two women looking after him , thoroughly puzzled .

( It is day . ) &nbsp; HANKHowdy , Jabez.  --  47  --  &nbsp; JABEZHowdy , Hank . &nbsp; HANK ( meekly , with a feeling of apology ) Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez ? &nbsp; JABEZ ( condescendingly ) Why , of course , Hank  --  I 've always got time for a neighbor . What 's on your mind ? &nbsp; HANKWell  --  here 's how it is . . . Tom Sharp , Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about  --  that new sort of organization  --  grange they call it . What you think about it ? &nbsp; JABEZI do n't know  --  do n't seem much of an idea to me . &nbsp; HANKYes , but what does a farmer do if he do n't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks ? &nbsp; JABEZOh  --  you do n't have to go to Miser Stevens while I 'm around . &nbsp; HANKDo n't I ? . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jabez . &nbsp; JABEZNot at all , Hank . . . not at all . Glad to help you . &nbsp; HANKThanks , Jabez  --  I really would n't need very much . . . if you could let me have some seed to start off with enough for spring planting . . . &nbsp; JABEZSeed ? . . . Easiest thing in the world . Come along , Hank , we 'll pick out everything you need , right now .  --  48  --  They walk toward the barn . &nbsp; HANKSay . . . about the interest . . . &nbsp; JABEZNow do n't you worry about that . You just leave it all to me . We wo n't talk business now . . . just bear this in mind . . . I 'm not the man to get rich on other people 's hard luck . . . . No , sir . . . not me ! . . . They enter the barn . &nbsp; JABEZI been through the mill myself , an ' I know just how you feel . Here . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bin , Hank standing beside him . &nbsp; JABEZHere , that 's the best seed you 'll find anywhere around New Hampshire . And as the seed runs through Jabez 's hand the scene dissolves to a series of views ( " montage shots " ) of the STONE FARM by day : We see it prospering under the skies of late spring and then summer . We see all the stony fields blossoming . . . the little blades of green starting from the earth ; the corn growing thick and mighty high in one field . . . the barley rank and heavy-headed in another . We see a fine new bull being led to the barn , and two new cows . The corn and barley stand ripe and golden in Jabez 's fields . Section Details THIS DISSOLVES TO THE BEDROOM ON A LATE AFTERNOON This dissolves to the BEDROOM on a late afternoon : Mary , her eyes closed , is lying on the fourposter bed . She is fully dressed . Her bosom rises and falls in the breathing of gentle sleep . Jabez has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His face , however , seems more mature and serious with a growing self-importance . &nbsp; JABEZ ( in a whisper ) Mary . . . He stops on seeing her asleep and turns away from the bed . He starts back toward door ; turns to the bed again ; comes back to it and pulls the patchwork quilt up over Mary , covering her . Then he tiptoes out . In the KITCHEN Ma Stone sits by the fireplace , knitting . She readjusts her spectacles and squints a bit . Jabez enters , having come downstairs again , and paces up and down the room . &nbsp; MA STONE  --  49  --  It wo n't be the first baby ever born in this house . ( fumbling with her knitting ) There ! Made me drop a stitch ! ( as Jabez continues his pacing ) Sit down , you make me nervous ! ( But he does n't sit ) Lan 's , that 's the way a man always is . Thinks his son 's the most important thing in the world . &nbsp; JABEZMy son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; MA STONE ( laughing ) Oh , go along with you ! As if it mattered to a grandma ! But p'raps you got an even chance . There is a sudden blink of lightning at the window . &nbsp; MA STONELooks like a storm , all of a sudden . Hope it wo n't wake Mary . She lights a lamp . &nbsp; JABEZ ( looking out the window ) Queer sort of weather we 're having  --  queer like everything else . &nbsp; MA STONEWell , thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather . We 've got enough for the whole United States . &nbsp; JABEZI feel  --  fidgety , Ma  --  not right at all . &nbsp; MA STONELan 's , I 'd think you was having the baby , to hear you . &nbsp; JABEZ ( after a pause ) Me  --  a son . He pauses and glances at the window as though somebody might be there looking in at him . He sees only the dark clouds and the racked tree on which his doom is carved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; JABEZMoney  --  money 's a funny thing , ai n't it , Ma ? &nbsp; MA STONEI figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it , Son . &nbsp; JABEZ ( eagerly ) Do you really think that ? &nbsp; MA STONEWhy , that 's just sense , Son . Now a man like Daniel Webster  --  guess they pay him high for what he does . But he 's worth it  --  and he helps others . Makes all the difference . &nbsp; JABEZI know , Ma , but  --  Suppose a man got his money in bad ways  --  &nbsp; MA STONE ( with a snap of her jaws ) Would n't profit him none . Jabez is glancing again at the darkened window when there is a flash of lightning , as though mocking him . &nbsp; MA STONEYou see , son ? I 'm old and I 've lived . When a man gets his money in bad ways  --  when he sees the better course and takes the worse  --  then the devil is in his heart  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a man could change that , could n't he ? &nbsp; MA STONEA man can always change things , Son . That 's what makes him different from barnyard critters . Jabez , having stared out of the window at the racked tree , now heads with determination for the door . &nbsp; MA STONEWhere you going , Son ?  --  51  --  But Jabez does not heed her and goes out silently . OUTSIDE THE STONE FARM : Dark clouds are rolling up steadily and there are occasional flashes of distant lightning . We follow Jabez as he hastens along and comes up to the racked tree . He looks about him , rather furtively , taking care not to be seen , then takes out a large pocket knife and attempts to gouge out the date that Scratch had fixed on the tree . But he finds that the lettering is too deep and makes no headway . And , giving up the attempt , Jabez determines on something else . He rushes to the barn . Now Jabez enters the BARN and hunts about . He finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tree again when the drumming of a great burst of hail is heard on the roof and sheets of it are seen falling outside the barn door . The pellets of hail are enormous . Then , as Jabez stops and whirls about , Scratch emanates from the shadows , or is suddenly revealed in a flash of lightning , standing calm , suave and smiling . &nbsp; SCRATCHGood evening , Neighbor Stone . &nbsp; JABEZLook here now --  &nbsp; SCRATCHOh come , Neighbor Stone . I would n't cut that tree if I were you . It means a breach of contract . &nbsp; JABEZI do n't care . &nbsp; SCRATCHBut you should , now that you are becoming a father . &nbsp; JABEZLeave your tongue off of that ! &nbsp; SCRATCHOh , certainly . I sha n't even come to the christening  --  it would be tactless and in wretched bad taste . ( laughing ) But I may send a friend of mine  --  just for old sake 's sake . Yes , I might do that . He strokes his chin thoughtfully . &nbsp; MA STONE 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Jabez ! &nbsp; SCRATCHYour mother ! I find her a little difficult  --  hardly the type for our sort of thing . ( stepping back ) Good night , Neighbor Stone . Scratch bows and leaves , almost imperceptibly , through the rear door ; one moment he is there , the next he is gone , leaving Jabez staring after him . The hail continues to fall . The cattle come out of their trance-like silence . The horse stamps . Jabez goes toward the warped board where the money is hidden when Ma Stone enters through the front door . Over her head she holds an old coat to protect her from the hail . &nbsp; MA STONE ( breathless ) Oh , here you are , Jabez . Lan 's , I was worried about you . . . . Hail in August ! The crops will be ruined ! &nbsp; JABEZIt do n't matter ! &nbsp; MA STONEWhat 's that you say , Son ? &nbsp; JABEZI say  --  it do n't matter . &nbsp; MA STONE ( also greatly relieved ) Now that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard for that crop . But we 'll make out . &nbsp; JABEZMake out ? We 'll do better than that ! I never thought I 'd be glad for bad luck , but I am . I never thought I 'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time , but I am ! Oh , bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain ! Ma Stone nods again , lips still pursed . Hail drums loudly on the roof . Twilight has dropped outside and it is dark . Section Details THE SCENE DISSOLVES TO JABEZ STONE 'S CORNFIELD EARLY NEXT MORNING The scene dissolves to JABEZ STONE 'S CORNFIELD early next morning : We see not only Jabez 's cornfield but the fields of neighboring farmers , farther down the slope and up the valley . In the bright light of the glistening morning , Jabez 's field of corn stands straight and high , the golden banners waving in  --  53  --  the breeze , unscathed by the devastating hail of the night before . But in tragic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth , pelted down into worthlessness . Jabez , Mary and Ma stand by the stone fence , near the road , staring in wonder at the miracle of their standing corn . &nbsp; MARYRuined  --  all the fields  --  ruined . ( kneels down as in prayer ) &nbsp; JABEZMary  --  but look  --  it did n't touch an ear of my corn  --  we 'll have a rich harvest . &nbsp; MA STONEFor unto everyone that hath shall be given  --  and he shall have abundance . Jabez , lifting his head , looks at her with a sudden and unpredictable challenge . &nbsp; JABEZThat 's right , Ma ! As he stands there , silent under the bright morning , two farmers , owners of the blasted fields beyond , pass him on the road , going down to their fields . They walk with a discouraged slump to their shoulders and lagging steps . As they come up to Jabez he greets them . &nbsp; JABEZHelloh , Hank  --  halloh Lem  --  But they do n't answer . They raise their eyes and look at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him again . Their eyes seem to bore through him with a burning accusation , and they hardly nod their heads in greeting as they trudge on . Jabez looks after them , conscience-stricken . Then he turns abruptly and starts back toward his farmhouse . At the " WASHINGTON ARMS " TAVERN later that day . A group of farmers is congregated in corners where the bar is located . Some of the farmers we have seen before are there  --  Lem , Noah , Tom Sharp , and others we have not seen , keep on drifting in . Cy Bibber , the host and bartender , is serving drinks . &nbsp; LEM ( at the bar ) Charge me up for another rum , Cy . Only way I kin forget my troubles . &nbsp; CY BIBBERSorry , Lem , but I 'll have to count my pennies , too .  --  54  --  &nbsp; STEVENS ( to Bibber ) Let him have one more  --  on me. ( to Lem ) You 'd think Stone 's standing in good with Providence , somehow . &nbsp; LEMMy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crow 's nest . &nbsp; STEVENSMaybe you 'd let me help you out a bit . &nbsp; SETHSeems like someone 's giving us the horse-laugh . &nbsp; TOM SHARPGuess you 're ripe and ready now to join our Grange , eh , boys ? &nbsp; STEVENSNow wait a moment , folks . . . I can make you some better terms . At this point Scratch , in farmer 's clothes , enters and comes to the bar . &nbsp; CY BIBBERHowdy . &nbsp; SCRATCHHowdy.  --  Never did see such a hail ! Big as bowling balls out my way . Broke all the winders an ' nearly killed the cat . I 'll have cider  --  hard . ( turning to the others ) Boys , I 'm here with an offer from Jabez Stone . &nbsp; LEMWhat 's that ? &nbsp; SCRATCHWell  --  seeing as how due to yesterday 's hail , nobody 's got nothing to harvest in his own fields , Jabez says maybe you could help him harvest his . There is a pause as the farmers look at each other uncomfortably . They feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no position to refuse . &nbsp; SETH  --  55  --  ( bitterly ) Never worked fer anybody else in my whole life , ' ceptin ' when I was a shaver , and that was for my old man . &nbsp; TOM SHARPI would n't do it . &nbsp; LEMWell  --  du n no  --  I 'll think it over . &nbsp; SCRATCH ( with a smile ) What 's there to think about , boys ? Here 's a dollar in advance for every one who will work for Jabez . He throws down money on the bar . And now STONE 'S FIELDS come to view . The farmers are cutting and shocking Jabez 's bumper corn crop  --  Seth , Lem , Noah , Tom Sharp , and others . Jabez rides through the fields on his sleek new horse , watching his neighbors harvest his crops . He shows a certain condescension toward them which is akin to arrogance . Another view of Jabez 's fields discloses the harvest , in great bursting wagons , rolling into the barn . The big new barn is fast approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watched over by Jabez like a Lord of the Manor . Not only is Jabez harvesting corn and hay but autumn fruits , too , in abundance . Section Details THE SCENE THEN DISSOLVES TO THE OUTSIDE BEDROOM IN THE EVENING The scene then dissolves to the OUTSIDE BEDROOM in the evening while faint festive music is heard  --  simple folk-music played on fiddle , fife and banjo mostly . It is coming from Jabez 's new barn where the harvest festival is in full swing . Outside is the great red harvest moon , just rising . Jabez goes to the closed door and listens , putting his ear against it . He makes as though to rap on the door , but changes his mind . He walks away again , digging his hands in his pockets , and paces back and forth . Suddenly , Ma Stone opens the door . &nbsp; JABEZ ( rushing to help ) Ma  --  is she ?  --  &nbsp; MA STONE ( complacently ) You 'll be a father any minute now . &nbsp; JABEZ ( gulping ) Golly , Ma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ) Consarn that music ! Should n't a-had the harvest festival tonight . &nbsp; MA STONEFiddlesticks ! She do n't hear it . Got better music to listen to than that . ( as there is the sudden cry of a newlyborn child ) There  --  that 's what I mean . Jabez stands spellbound as the strident cry of the child drowns out the music of the dance , and Ma Stone turns back into the room . Presently , Jabez , on tiptoes , moves to the room , frightened and trembling . The scene dissolves to the OTHER BEDROOM at night . Mary is lying in a fourposter bed . A maid , typically New England , and the doctor are there . The doctor is just placing the baby , wrapped up in blankets , beside Mary and prepares to leave . Things necessary to a birth are about the room  --  kettle and basin of hot water , towels , and other articles . Mary looks down from her pillow at her baby , parting the cocoon of covers to see its tiny , wrinkled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JABEZMary  --  &nbsp; MARY ( smiling up at him weakly ) Hello , Jabez  --  ( after a pause ) Here 's your son . Jabez , too emotional to speak , stares down at the baby , a suspicion of moisture in his eyes . Mary closes her eyes , weakly but happily . Ma Stone , watching Mary anxiously , speaks in whisper to the maid . &nbsp; MA STONEFetch a bed warmer , Dorothy . The maid nods and goes out . Jabez still stands looking down on the baby as the doctor is putting things back in his bag . Jabez takes up the baby , awkwardly , as though handling something made of glass , and steps to the window that looks out on the new barn . He raises the window and the music comes floating into the room . He leans from window , holding the baby high in his arms . The NEW BARN at night ( seen from Jabez 's angle ) : There is a view of the front barn door , thrown open , providing a glimpse of the merrymakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the moon , stand near the door , talking and laughing .  --  57  --  &nbsp; JABEZ ( calling down , boyishly ) Hey ! Look , everybody ! Look here ! It 's a boy ! The group at the door stands transfixed for a moment , then they begin to cheer . &nbsp; GROUPHurray for Jabez Stone ! More good luck for Jabez Stone ! Hurray ! Jabez Stone and his new son ! The good word travels into the barn . Others crowd to the door . Musicians swing into something gay and triumphant . Cups of cider are passed about . They drink to Jabez and the new boy  --  and to Mary Stone . &nbsp; MA STONE ( behind Jabez ) Lan 's , shut that window , Jabez ! Want him to catch his death of cold ? She takes the baby away from him . &nbsp; JABEZ ( a little sheepishly ) Well  --  I  --  I- &nbsp; MARYDo n't be cross with him , Ma . This do n't happen every day . Ma Stone puts the baby down beside Mary again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes ; she smiles weakly and snuggles her cheek down against the baby . The baby cries and she hushes it . &nbsp; MA STONEYou go down and see what 's keeping Dorothy . &nbsp; JABEZSure , Ma . He hurries past the doctor , still collecting his things ; he pats him on the shoulder , as man to man . &nbsp; JABEZ ( as he goes out ) Thanks , doctor . The KITCHEN : In front of the fireplace , with her back turned to the door , a woman is standing . She is looking into the fire , seemingly musing over the blinking coals . Jabez comes hurriedly downstairs .  --  58  --  &nbsp; JABEZ ( bursting in ) Dorothy  --  what 's keeping you so long ? Mary needs that  --  He stops and looks intently . The woman turns slowly and looks him straight in the eye . She is a young , slender woman , with a strange , sultry prettiness ; she is externally demure but underneath there is a definite feeling of seething fire like the coals in the fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any woman we have yet seen in the picture . &nbsp; JABEZ ( taken aback ) You 're not  --  Dorothy . &nbsp; BELLE ( quietly , in a low toned , musical voice  --  unhurried and deliberate ) No . She 's gone . &nbsp; JABEZ ( looking about incredulous ) She could n't be gone ! &nbsp; BELLEBut she is  --  I 've taken her place . Do n't you remember  --  you wrote me a letter . Mrs. Stone was too ill . She digs down into the bosom of her gown and produces a letter . She shows it to him . Jabez stares at it . &nbsp; JABEZIt  --  it looks like my hand . She lets the letter drop from her hand and it twirls into the fire where it flares up abruptly . &nbsp; BELLEI have other recommendations , too , from a very good friend of yours . She makes a movement as if to produce them from the same place . &nbsp; JABEZ ( hoarsely ) Never mind . What 's your name ? &nbsp; BELLEBelle.  --  59  --  &nbsp; JABEZBelle  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; JABEZ ( as if hypnotized ) From over the mountain  --  Jabez continues to look at her and she holds his eye , steadily . &nbsp; MA STONE 'S VOICE ( calling down the stair ) Jabez ! Jabez ! Belle turns to the fireplace to fill the warming pan with coal . &nbsp; JABEZI 'll take it . &nbsp; BELLENo  --  that 's for me to do . She starts for the door passing on her way up Ma Stone who has gone to show the doctor out . The BEDROOM as Belle enters the room with the pan : &nbsp; MARY ( out of a dream ) Jabez  --  ? &nbsp; BELLE ( her voice very gentle and soothing ) I 've brought you something to keep you warm , Mrs. Stone  --  Belle props up Mary 's pillows , making them more comfortable , and puts the bed warmer in place . Mary simply stares at her . Instinctively her arm tightens about her little son . The music from the harvest festival is heard from outside . &nbsp; BELLEYou 're not resting well , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( she closes the window ) You need your sleep . Is there anything else you want ?  --  60  --  &nbsp; MARY ( very gratefully ) No , thank you  --  what 's your name ? &nbsp; BELLEBelle  --  &nbsp; MARYThank you , Belle  --  She leaves as Ma Stone comes in . &nbsp; MARY ( dreamily , as her eyes close ) What a nice  --  and kind girl  --  Who is she  --  ? &nbsp; MA STONEThe new girl  --  Jabez says ; she is from over the mountain . &nbsp; MARYWhat mountain ? Then her voice trails off and she sinks into sleep . The NEW BARN : The fodder bins and loft spaces are stuffed with the fruits of the harvest . It is a very large barn , representing the prosperity of Jabez Stone . Now it is brightly lit by lantern light and is decorated with sheaves of barley , tall stalks of corn , pumpkins and golden leaves from the autumn woods . The platform for the musicians is at the other end of the barn , and a refreshment table , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall . On the opposite side are tables , groaning with food  --  cakes , pies , cold meats , sausages , chickens , ducks , etc . A square dance is just beginning , as Belle appears , moving gracefully through the gay crowd . She has found a gay shawl to drape about her shoulders  --  an exotic shawl that might have come into New Hampshire from the cargo of a clipper ship , smelling of the Far East and dark ports of call . Everybody is having a good time except Miser Stevens who sits gloomily in a corner . Near the musicians ' stand , where couples are gathering for the next dance , the fiddler is Mr. Scratch , and as he looks down at Belle , he tucks his fiddle under his sharp chin and begins to play , very softly . Belle stands , her hands loosely clasped on her hips . Jabez comes up behind her . &nbsp; JABEZLet 's dance together  --  Belle . &nbsp; BELLE ( turning slowly ) No , Jabez  --  your place is with your wife  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little louder and the other musicians pick up the tune . Belle dances forward , alone , and is leading the couples as they start to dance . &nbsp; BELLE ( gaily ) Faster  --  faster  --  Scratch , over his fiddle , smiles down at her and nods . &nbsp; BELLE ( dancing on ) Faster  --  faster  --  She breathes this out at Jabez as she passes him . The dancers move faster and faster . There is something utterly abandoned about it . The harvest moon gleams in at the great door . Then the scene fades out . pp. 25-41 &nbsp; pp. 62-77 THE BEDROOM - COLD MOONLIGHT IN THE ROOM The BEDROOM , cold moonlight in the room : It is a winter night , and a candle burns beside Mary . Between Mary and Jabez lies the baby . The baby cries and Mary turns and tries to soothe it . &nbsp; MARYShh  --  go to sleep , little Daniel  --  go to sleep . The baby continues to cry . Mary hums a little song to the child . &nbsp; MARY ( singing ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sleep , sleep , my baby  --  Raccoon sits in the spruce all night , Sleep , baby , sleep  --  &nbsp; JABEZ ( who has not been asleep , speaks irritably ) What in sugar hill 's the matter with him ? &nbsp; MARYNothing , Jabez  --  just natural for a baby to cry , sometimes . ( as the baby still cries , she tries to quiet him again ) Shh , little Daniel  --  sleep  --  sleep  --  She continues her song , but it does not help . &nbsp; JABEZ ( flinging back the covers angrily )  --  62  --  Consarn it ! He gets up . &nbsp; MARYJabez ! Jabez is getting into his trousers . &nbsp; MARYWhere are you going  --  ? Jabez opens the door , still struggling with his clothes , and goes out , shutting the door after him . Mary sits up in bed , looking bewildered at the closed door . &nbsp; MARY ( calling ) Jabez ! Jabez ! His footsteps dwindle down the stairs . A silence . Mary drops back on her pillow . Tears start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps on crying . Section Details THE SCENE DISSOLVES TO A COUNTRY ROAD IN WINTER The scene dissolves to a COUNTRY ROAD IN WINTER , the sun shining on the banks of snow . Visible now is Jabez 's sleigh , the graceful , swan-like kind of 1840 , and Jabez 's new , sleek horse is pulling it . There are bells on the harness , gaily jingling as the sleigh goes skimming over the icy road , up hill , then onto a lake , locked in ice . Next JABEZ 'S SLEIGH appears at close range and Jabez is seen driving with Belle , in becoming winter costume , seated beside him . The keen wind blows against her cheeks , reddening them into the semblance of Christmas berries , hard and brightly scarlet . Her eyes glitter like sparklets of frost . Jabez wears a coonskin cap and a great winter coat . He is urging on the horse , faster and faster , flicking its rump with his whip . &nbsp; JABEZ ( laughing ) Golly , Belle , that was a good idea  --  we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jabez laughs . Belle laughs , too , very softly . &nbsp; BELLEMake him go faster , Jabez  --  faster  --  faster  --   --  63  --  Jabez calls to the horse and flicks the whip . They skim on toward the lake . The LAKE is seen closer : It is day , and the lake is like a jewel of crystal in a setting of black spruce trees . We see the dark figure of a man , on the ice of the lake , stooping over a hole he has cut there . Now the sleigh appears on the edge of the lake . &nbsp; JABEZ ( standing up in sleigh and waving his whip ) Hey , you ! Hey ! A close view discloses a man by the hole in the ice . Bundled up in heavy clothes , the man is fishing . He is pulling up a fish through the hole , beside him a pile of fish he has just caught . He turns as he hears Jabez 's voice . &nbsp; JABEZ 'S VOICEYou ca n't fish there ! Private property ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! The man , frightened , begins to run . He leaves his other fish behind him , but holds onto his line with a fish dangling to it . He runs across the ice , slipping , falling , getting up again and running . He plunges into the spruces on the other side of the lake . A close view of Jabez 's sleigh discloses Belle laughing as she watches the man running and falling on the ice . Jabez is still standing up in the sleigh , brandishing his whip and laughing , too . He drops back in the sleigh again as the man disappears . &nbsp; JABEZ ( still laughing ) It 's wonderful to frighten people like that  --  and watch them run . As Jabez picks up the fish the scene dissolves to the KITCHEN , where a bright fire is burning in the fireplace . Ma Stone is standing by the doorway to the stairs , dressed in her Sunday clothes , wearing her new shawl , and putting on her bonnet . The baby is lying in its cradle by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Ready ? First bell 's a-ringing ! &nbsp; MARY ( coming downstairs ) Yes , Ma  --  I 'm ready  --  She enters the room , dressed in " Sunday-best " also . The baby whimpers and Mary starts toward the cradle , but before she gets there , Jabez and Belle  --  64  --  enter . They are dressed as we last saw them in the sleigh , and their faces are ruddy from the wind over the snow . Belle instantly crosses to the cradle ; she throws off her heavy wrap and kneels beside the baby , crooning to it , and the baby stops crying . Jabez strides to the table and throws the fish down on it . &nbsp; JABEZ ( turning to Mary ) Good morning , Mary . Brought some fish for us . Want you to cook ' em for breakfast . Mary turns and looks at him , her soft eyes filled with pain and confusion . &nbsp; MA STONEShe 'll do nothing of the kind ! She 's going to church with me , right away ! &nbsp; MARY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul . . . please come with us . &nbsp; JABEZI want you to fix these fish ! &nbsp; MA STONEAnd I say she wo n't ! I 'll not have the scorn of God on this place  --  with the smell of fish in it , polluting up the Sabbath ! ( turning to Belle ) And as for you  --  let me tell you , young woman . . . ! Church bells are heard faintly . &nbsp; MARYCome along , Ma . Second bell 's a-ringing . Mary crosses to Ma Stone and they go , closing the door behind them . We hear Mary and Ma driving away in the buggy . &nbsp; JABEZWe 'll cook ' em ourselves . You 'll help me , Belle . &nbsp; BELLEOf course I will . At this moment , the front door opens and Stevens enters . &nbsp; STEVENSMornin ' , Jabez . . .  --  65  --  &nbsp; JABEZHello , Stevens . . . you 're early today . &nbsp; STEVENSYes , I wanted to get here before the others . . . . I want to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jabez hurries about the room , arranging chairs and pulling out a table from the wall . He seems to know exactly what to do , from long practice . He goes to the cupboard , brings out some bottles of rum and hard cider and cups , and goes to a drawer in the table and produces a dice box and dice . There is a rap on the back door , and Belle goes gracefully to the door and opens it , making a low curtsy . Squire Slossum , Aaron Coffin , the heavy-set banker of Cross Corners , and two other silent , poker-faced men sneak in . &nbsp; SQUIRE AND OTHERS ( the Squire beating his cold hands together ) Good morning , m'am  --  Good morning , Jabez . &nbsp; JABEZ AND BELLEGood morning . &nbsp; BELLESit down , gentlemen . &nbsp; SQUIRE ( ogling her ) Thanks , m'am . He sits , pompously , at the head of the table . The others sit about the same table . Jabez draws up a chair , too , and takes up the dice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  He brings out a roll of bills and hands them reluctantly over to Jabez . &nbsp; JABEZI hope you 'll have better luck today , Squire . Jabez counts the bills , avidly and over-carefully , holding some up to the light to see that they are not counterfeit ; then pockets the bills . He begins to roll the dice as each man silently stacks up his betting money before him . The game proceeds , and Belle serves the rum and hard cider , watching the men as they play . Suddenly the baby begins to cry again . Belle goes to it  --  66  --  instantly , and takes it up from the cradle and rocks it in her arms . She croons to it . The song she croons is a French lullaby . It has a strange , haunting melody , and the French words fall curiously in that New England kitchen . &nbsp; SQUIRE ( again ogling her ) You French ? &nbsp; BELLE ( looking at him through half-closed eyes ) No  --  I 'm not anything . She goes on singing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rap on the door . The players are startled , and they pause . &nbsp; BELLE ( looking out the window ) Sheriff 's coming  --  Belle very calmly goes to the door . &nbsp; JABEZCome in , Sheriff . &nbsp; SHERIFFJabez  --  seems like I 've been hearing talk around . Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church , Sabbath morning . &nbsp; JABEZBelle , give the Sheriff a cup of rum . THE CROSS CORNERS CHURCH , with the congregation assembled : It is the very end of the service . The severity and serenity of the Sabbath peace lies like a blessing over the bowed heads of the faithful . In the third pew we see Ma Stone and Mary , with an empty place beside them . &nbsp; VOICE OF MINISTERAlmighty God , who hast given us this good land for our heritage ; we humbly beseech Thee that we may always prove ourselves a people mindful of Thy favor and glad to do Thy will . Save us from discord and confusion ; from pride and  --  67  --  arrogancy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from pride and arrogancy , and from every evil way . &nbsp; VOICE OF MINISTERIn the time of prosperity , fill our hearts with thankfulness , and in our day of trouble , suffer not our trust in Thee to fail  --  amen . &nbsp; VOICE OF CONGREGATION ( in unison ) Amen . They lift their heads . The church bell begins to peal . Another service is ended . The KITCHEN : The bells peal through this and now faintly come to the ears of the players , among them the Sheriff . They look up . The last dice are rolled quickly . Money is gathered in ; debts are paid . Silently , and in haste , the guests collect their coats and hats and mufflers . They begin to file out the door . &nbsp; SQUIREGood-bye , Stone  --  next Sunday , as usual . He smiles unctuously at Belle and goes out . When they are all gone , Jabez closes the door . Belle is putting away the table and the cups and jugs . Jabez hides the cards . Belle returns to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low stool beside the cradle and begins to rock it , humming softly to the child . The bells from Cross Corners gradually stop ringing over the snow-locked countryside . Jabez draws up a chair to the table and begins adding up his winnings in his account book and ledgers . He hunts for the date in an old-fashioned almanac . . . finds it . . . puts his finger on it . We see Jabez 's fingers turning the pages of the almanac  --  the leaves turning swiftly , and we see the years drop away , faster and faster  --  leaves of the years falling from the tree of Time . Section Details BLUEPRINTS OF A HOUSE BLUEPRINTS of a house ( Jabez Stone 's mansion ) appear . Jabez 's hand makes notes and corrections . Details of the front view of the new house appear until finally the full view of the mansion is seen over the shoulder of a man on horseback , dressed for fox hunting . Workmen are still putting the finishing touches on the new house . Furniture is carried in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head  --  it is Jabez Stone . He looks back at the old farm where he was born . Then the scene fades out . The EXTERIOR OF THE FARMHOUSE fades in . It is morning , and Ma Stone , in her regular old working clothes , grimly sticking to them in a spirit of defiance , is tending her flower beds and " herb " garden , near the side porch ,  --  68  --  transplanting tender new slips . Her sleeves are rolled up and her arms and hands are covered with good earth . She is kneeling over a flower bed . Jabez 's little son Daniel is with her . &nbsp; WEBSTERGranny , when do we move to the new house ? &nbsp; MA STONEMove ?  --  We are not going to move  --  the old one is good enough for us . &nbsp; WEBSTERBut I like the new one better . &nbsp; MA STONEThat 's just too bad  --  Daniel , very cautiously , takes out his beanshooter . A mother hen and her chicks come around the side of the house , pecking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel loads his mouth with dried beans and aims the beanshooter at the chickens . He makes a direct hit on the old mother hen . She squawks and flies up in the air with a great flapping of wings . The chicks cheep frantically and run about . &nbsp; MA STONE ( startled out of her skin ) Lan 's to goodness , what happened to that hen ? Did you use that beanshooter again ? &nbsp; WEBSTER ( all innocence ; hiding the beanshooter ) I did not , Grandma . &nbsp; MARY ( coming from kitchen door behind them ) Yes , you did , Daniel ! I saw it from the window . And then to lie about it ! Give me that beanshooter , Daniel ! &nbsp; WEBSTER ( jumping up and dancing away ) It 's mine , Ma ! Pa made it for me  --  and I 'm not going to give it to anyone ! &nbsp; MARY ( reaching for it ) Daniel give me that beanshooter ! &nbsp; WEBSTER  --  69  --  ( attacking Mary ) No ! No ! I wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ) I 've stood just about as much as I can bear ! Mary drags the yowling Daniel toward the woodshed that is not far from the kitchen door ; a sort of lean-to on the rest of the house as was the custom then . At this moment Jabez rides up on horseback with Belle beside him . &nbsp; JABEZWhat happened . . . . Where are you taking him ? &nbsp; MARYI am going to lock him up . &nbsp; JABEZ ( dismounting ) You 're not supposed to punish my son , Mary . &nbsp; BELLEThat 's my business .  --  Now , it 's all right , Daniel . ( to Mary as Daniel continues to cry ) What did he do ? &nbsp; MARYHe lied to me again . &nbsp; WEBSTERI did not ! &nbsp; BELLE ( to Mary ) He never lies to me. ( to Daniel ) Do n't cry , Daniel  --  I believe you . You 're always a very good boy and  --  now come along . She leads him into the house . &nbsp; MARY ( to Jabez ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the boy is present ? He wo n't respect me any more . &nbsp; JABEZ  --  70  --  ( coldly ) Is n't that your own fault ? &nbsp; MARYMy fault ? . . . Oh , Jabez  --  all I want is to be proud of him . He can be such a fine boy , if we show him how to be . &nbsp; JABEZHe 's my son and I like him the way he is . Why do you always have to pick on him ? If it 's not the boy it 's me . You do n't like the way I live  --  you do n't like my friends , or my new house  --  or anything . &nbsp; MARYBut Jabez , I never said that ! &nbsp; JABEZIt shows on your face . &nbsp; MARYWell  --  I am worried about the way you 've changed . That was one thing you said you 'd never do  --  remember ? &nbsp; JABEZOh , for heaven 's sake , leave me alone ! Daniel and Belle are coming out of the house . Jabez picks him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go fox hunting in the upper pasture . &nbsp; WEBSTERHurray ! ( pulling out beanshooter from his pocket and waving it ) I 'm going to shoot the old fox dead with my beanshooter . Jabez , laughing , lifts Daniel on his horse . &nbsp; WEBSTER ( calling to Ma Stone ) Grandma , look at me ! &nbsp; MA STONE ( squinting up at him but still squatting beside the flower bed )  --  71  --  I see you ! Riding pretty high , ai n't you ? Look out you do n't fall off . &nbsp; WEBSTERNot me ! ( pretending to balance himself , using his arms ) Jabez , Daniel and Belle ride off . &nbsp; MA STONE ( to Mary ) Fox hunting  --  a Stone going fox hunting on a week day  --  and the earth crying out for the touch of him ! &nbsp; MARYNow , Ma  --  You just try to set an example for me , and keep hold of yourself . &nbsp; MA STONE ( rising from flower bed ) Me ? Why , look here , Mary Stone  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; MARYWorried about me ! Well , you just stop it ! &nbsp; MA STONEWhat 's that ? &nbsp; MARY ( something steely in her voice ) I said you should stop worrying because I 've made up my mind ! She turns and goes quickly into the house . Ma Stone looks after her , concerned . . . . Section Details THE SCENE DISSOLVES TO A ROAD THROUGH MARSHFIELD ON DANIEL WEBSTER 'S FARM The scene dissolves to a ROAD THROUGH MARSHFIELD ON DANIEL WEBSTER 'S FARM in the late afternoon : This is a fair , fertile countryside , and all about are the green fields , smiling under June skies . Mary is seen driving Jabez 's old buggy up the road . A farmhand with button-like black eyes and a friendly smile is walking along the road . &nbsp; MARY ( stopping the horse ) Mr. Webster 's place ? &nbsp; FARMHANDYes , m'am  --  musta come many a long mile , m'am.  --  72  --  Horse looks tired  --  moving like cold molasses . &nbsp; MARYYes  --  we have come a long way  --  all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope he 's at home . &nbsp; FARMHANDYes , m'am  --  he 's here . The FIELD OF THE WEST TWO HUNDRED , discloses Webster mowing his clover field , two farmhands , giant young men , working with him . &nbsp; OLD FARMHAND 'S VOICE ( calling through this ) Hey there , Dan'l ! Black Dan'l ! &nbsp; WEBSTER ( pulling in the oxen ; turning toward road and calling lustily ) Hullooo ! &nbsp; OLD FARMHAND 'S VOICESomeone to see you , Dan'l ! &nbsp; WEBSTERIf it 's the British Minister , take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira  --  &nbsp; OLD FARMHAND 'S VOICEJust someone from New Hampshire ! &nbsp; WEBSTER ( shouting ) Why , that 's different ! ( to the other farmhands ) Well , boys , I guess we 'll knock off . I 've got to see a friend . He turns over the oxen to the other men and starts striding across the field . The scene dissolves to the DINING ROOM AT MARSHFIELD that evening . It is a splendid big room of the period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at the head of the board and Mary sits at his right . A generous meal has just been eaten . They have finished their dessert , with most of the dishes cleared away . &nbsp; WEBSTERWell Mary , it 's too bad I did n't know  --  I would have given you a real dinner , but with my wife being in Washington  --  Have another piece  --  73  --  of pie  --  ( starting to cut a generous slice ) &nbsp; MARYNo , really , thank you .  --  Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon ? &nbsp; WEBSTERWell  --  she hardly ever comes here  --  she 's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country . Yes  --  I 'm all on my own  --  sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely  --  ( he pulls out a big cigar ) Do you mind if I indulge ? &nbsp; MARYOf course not  --  &nbsp; WEBSTERNo , you would n't  --  You 're not the sort of woman that 's afraid of smoke  --  or fire  --  But now let 's talk about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done nothing but talk about that all through dinner . &nbsp; WEBSTERYes , you 've chatted a lot , woman-like nibbling around the edge  --  But , Mary , forgive an old lawyer 's legal mind , I do n't think you ever once came to the point . And there is a point , is n't there ? &nbsp; MARYWhy  --  yes  --  it 's hard to put it into words , Mr. Webster . There 's this matter of little Daniel 's schooling and the new house  --  and well  --  there 's something else that 's wrong  --  it gets worse , year after year  --  it 's like a shadow growing  --  I ca n't really talk about it , even to Ma  --  she puts it all on Jabez and I wo n't stand for that . &nbsp; WEBSTERI 've heard some odd things about Jabez lately  --  he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself . &nbsp; MARYMr . Webster , you must n't believe all that  --  74  --  people say . &nbsp; WEBSTERYou do n't have to defend him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; MARYYou see , I do n't care if we are rich or poor  --  I do n't care if we 're big or small , all I care about is Jabez . He was the first man I loved . He never used to care about money  --  we were poor as Job 's turkey , but none of us minded . Now I 've seen him drive the poor from the door , and we used to be poor ourselves . I 've seen him get hard and mean , and he is n't hard or mean . I 've heard him mock at the church bells  --  the bells that rang for our wedding . That 's not like him , Mr. Webster  --  It must be my fault somehow  --  my fault . &nbsp; WEBSTERMary  --  you 've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little . You see , sometimes we think we 're licked in this life  --  but we were n't put here to be licked . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of us  --  the shadows and the evil  --  but it is still up to us to fight . Now I was thinking before you came , of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month , to get acquainted with my Godson  --  and other things . &nbsp; MARY ( breathlessly ) Oh , could you , Mr. Webster ? &nbsp; WEBSTERAnd now come on , Mary . I want to show you the all-fired biggest parsnips in the whole United States , raised right here in Marshfield  --  of course ! He links arms with her , in a warm , affectionate , fatherly manner and walks her toward the door . Section Details THE SCENE DISSOLVES TO THE HALL OF JABEZ 'S NEW HOUSE AT NIGHT The scene dissolves to the HALL OF JABEZ 'S NEW HOUSE at night : The last finishing touches are being done by the workmen . For that part of the country , the house is ostentatious to the last degree . Perhaps it is borrowed freely from the Adams period . Jabez stands in front of a mirror , getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take off the sleeve from the  --  75  --  evening coat Jabez is wearing . Belle is looking on . &nbsp; JABEZLooks all right !  --  Do you have to tear it all down again ? &nbsp; TAILORI 'm sorry , sir  --  that 's part of the fitting . &nbsp; JABEZWell , as long as you have it ready for the party  --  ( to Belle ) Look , Belle  --  that 'll give the folks something to talk about  --  &nbsp; BELLE ( correcting him ) The people , Jabez  --  the people . &nbsp; JABEZThe  --  folks or people , what 's the difference among friends ? The Squire comes in . &nbsp; JABEZHowdy , Squire ! Howdy ! Oh  --  how do you do , Squire . &nbsp; SQUIREHow do you do , Belle ? How are you , Jabez ? ( looks about , very much impressed ) Well  --  mighty elegant house you got here . &nbsp; JABEZYou really think so ? Now two workmen come through the room , carrying a billiard table . &nbsp; JABEZ ( to the workmen ) Hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brussels carpet  --  Consarn them . &nbsp; BELLEJabez ! Careful  --  &nbsp; JABEZOh  --  ( confused )  --  76  --  Did n't mean to talk like that in front of a lady . ( to Belle ) Get some wine for the Squire , Belle . &nbsp; SQUIREWell , Jabez  --  I 'm a little pressed for time . You wanted to discuss something  --  some business  --  &nbsp; JABEZOh yes  --  yes . Wo n't take a minute . Can you keep a secret ? &nbsp; SQUIREWhy of course  --  &nbsp; JABEZDan'l Webster is coming to my party . &nbsp; SQUIREDan'l Webster ? &nbsp; JABEZYes  --  and that 's the reason I wanted to talk with you . You got my invitation ? &nbsp; SQUIREYes . &nbsp; JABEZ ( taking out a paper ) Now look  --  here 's a list of the people I invited  --  they 're all the right kind of people  --  or did I miss anybody ? &nbsp; SQUIRE ( glancing over the list ) The only one you missed  --  is the President . &nbsp; JABEZYou think that 's a joke ? I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webster might feel insulted . The Squire makes a move to return the list . &nbsp; JABEZYou keep that  --  that 's for you . I want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come .  --  77  --  &nbsp; SQUIREYou want me to go around  --  &nbsp; JABEZYes siree  --  that 's the idea . Get them all here and then say : " Look , folks  --  here 's Daniel Webster , my guest of honor . " Golly , I can see their eyes pop already . &nbsp; SQUIREYou mean that 's all you had me come out here for ? &nbsp; JABEZNow , Squire , you 're not going to let me down . We still want to do a lot of business together , do n't we ? &nbsp; SQUIREWell  --  yes  --  &nbsp; JABEZThat 's fine . Now you can tell people all about the house , but do n't mention Webster . &nbsp; SQUIREYou are not so sure that he 'll come . &nbsp; JABEZOh yes  --  I am  --  want to bet ? &nbsp; SQUIREWhy not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just what I owe you . &nbsp; JABEZ ( extending his hand ) Shake ! They shake hands . pp. 42-61 &nbsp; pp. 78-95 THE SCENE DISSOLVES INTO A ROAD TO CROSS CORNERS The scene dissolves into a ROAD TO CROSS CORNERS . It is day , and a carriage drawn by two magnificent horses appears , driven by Webster . The carriage is brought to a stop as it reaches little Daniel who is reading a handbill from a circus .  --  78  --  &nbsp; WEBSTER ( calling ) Hello , Colonel ! Want a lift ? &nbsp; WEBSTERWell , I would n't mind . ( as he runs up to carriage ) But my name 's Daniel Stone . &nbsp; WEBSTERAll right , Daniel . Jump in . Daniel does so , and they drive along the road . In WEBSTER 'S CARRIAGE as Webster and Daniel are driving along the road toward Cross Corners . &nbsp; WEBSTERGee  --  that Fair  --  &nbsp; WEBSTERIt has n't opened yet ? &nbsp; WEBSTERNo  --  but I can hardly wait  --  Mister  --  tell me , will there really be  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire ? &nbsp; WEBSTERGuess there will , if it says so . &nbsp; WEBSTERAnd two unpara --  unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties ? What is that ? &nbsp; WEBSTERYoung man  --  you got me there . &nbsp; WEBSTER ( looking at the handbill again ) ' N Daniel Webster will be there . &nbsp; WEBSTER ( chuckling ) A varied list of attractions . And which would you like to see first , Dan'l ? &nbsp; WEBSTERI think I 'd like to begin with the fire-eater  --   --  79  --  &nbsp; WEBSTERAnd what about Daniel Webster ? &nbsp; WEBSTERWell , I thought he 'd come in the middle . &nbsp; WEBSTER ( laughing ) And serve him right ! Webster is driving faster now . He talks softly to the horses . Daniel fumbles in his coat pocket and slyly brings out his inevitable beanshooter . He puts beans in his mouth and when Webster is n't looking , blows a bean at the rear of one of the horses . The horse shies . Webster turns and catches Daniel before he can hide the beanshooter . &nbsp; WEBSTERDaniel ! Do n't ever let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It do n't hurt . &nbsp; WEBSTERIt does hurt ! And do n't you do it again . A pause . Webster urges on the horses as he chooses not to say anything more . The horses fly along the road . &nbsp; WEBSTERMake them go faster , Mr .. . . ? &nbsp; WEBSTERNo , Daniel  --  they are not race horses . They are good old friends of mine . I call ' em Constitution and Bill of Rights , the most dependable pair for long journeys . I 've got one called Missouri Compromise , too , and then there 's a Supreme Court  --  fine , dignified horse , though you do have to push him now and then . &nbsp; WEBSTERGolly  --  I 'd like to see all your horses ! &nbsp; WEBSTERMaybe you can , sometime , Daniel . I 'm a farmer , you know , and like to show my farm  --  but the thing I 'd like to show you most , you 'll have to see for yourself .  --  80  --  &nbsp; WEBSTERWhat 's that , sir ? &nbsp; WEBSTERWell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it  --  it 's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West . &nbsp; WEBSTERAnybody can see that . &nbsp; WEBSTERYou 're wrong , Mr. Stone . There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it . They ca n't see the country for the money in their pockets  --  And some think their state 's the country , or the way they live is the country , and they 're willing to split the country because of that . Well , I hope you 'll meet all those , when you 're grown . You 'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties  --  that 's part of the fair , to be sure . But if we 'd had to depend on them , in a permanent way , the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains . &nbsp; WEBSTERBut it did n't stop . I know it did n't stop . Granny told me it did n't . &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't  --  no matter what happens  --  just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union . So  --  ( to the horse ) Giddyap , Constitution  --  and let 's keep going , Mr. Stone . They drive ahead . &nbsp; WEBSTER ( shouting excitedly ) Faster  --  faster  --  He takes out his beanshooter and uses it again on the horses . Webster brings the buggy to a stop . &nbsp; WEBSTER ( grabbing Daniel more firmly )  --  81  --  I think this is coming to you , young man !  --  He turns him over his knee , taking the boy completely by surprise . &nbsp; WEBSTERI told you not to do that again . He begins to spank him . Daniel yowls . At the INN IN CROSS CORNERS , with a crowd of farmers : &nbsp; THE CROWD ( calling ) Black Dan'l ! Hurray for Daniel Webster ! The Union and Black Dan'l ! Hip , hip , hurray ! They rush forward . And now we see Webster 's carriage . Webster is just finishing spanking Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greet him . A close view reveals the boy , Daniel , sprawled across Webster 's knee . He looks up with tear-stained face as he hears the magic name of Daniel Webster ! His eyes open wide . He stares . Then , in complete humiliation , he escapes through the crowd .  --  Now we see Webster as the Squire approaches him . &nbsp; WEBSTERWell  --  well  --  what 's this ? I thought I 'd meet you all down there at Jabez Stone 's house-warming . I hope you did n't wait for me to lead the parade . &nbsp; SQUIRENot exactly , Mr. Webster .  --  We wanted to have a little chat with you before we go to the party . Do you mind having a drink with us ? &nbsp; WEBSTERDo I mind having a drink with you , gentlemen ? What a question to ask Daniel Webster ! Webster climbs from his carriage and goes to the inn followed by the Squire and the rest of the crowd . Section Details THE SCENE DISSOLVES TO THE KITCHEN OF THE OLD FARMHOUSE AT NIGHT The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night : Ma Stone is sitting by the window shelling peas . She interrupts her work to peer out into the darkness . Steps are heard above and as Ma turns around Mary appears at the foot of the stairs in her party dress . There is a moment of silence . &nbsp; MA STONESo you 've made up your mind to go to the party . &nbsp; MARYYou are n't angry with me ?  --  82  --  &nbsp; MA STONEAh , fiddlesticks  --  you are old enough to know what you are doing . They go to the door . The FRONT YARD : As Mary walks away through the darkness Ma stands in the doorway looking after her . &nbsp; MA STONE ( calling ) Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there . &nbsp; MARYI wo n't forget . Mary walks on as Ma looks after her . In the distance we see the flickering of the lights in the new house . The scene dissolves to the RECEPTION ROOM OF JABEZ 'S NEW MANSION , moving up impressive front stairs and through the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then into a reception room . Here are found a great many of the treasures that Jabez has bragged about . Servants of every description are waiting , and a small orchestra is in one corner , tuning up . There is a decided air of pretentiousness about it all , contrasting pointedly with the dance in Jabez 's barn , years before . Mary , dressed in a simple but becoming party gown , moves quietly about , seeing that all is correct and in readiness  --  a demure and charming hostess , hiding her real feelings quite successfully , for the moment . Jabez enters , just having come downstairs , dressed to " kill . " He goes to a full-length mirror on the wall , tying his cravat . There is something utterly pompous about him , at the same time tragic in its implications . &nbsp; JABEZ ( looking at his watch , then turning to Mary ) Why do n't they come  --  &nbsp; MARY ( helpless ) I do n't know , Jabez . Jabez walks up and down , waiting . Suddenly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something gay and jolly . The orchestra starts to play . Then Jabez , after another interval of nervous waiting , turns to Mary again .  --  83  --  &nbsp; JABEZThink this room is larger than anything Webster 's got at Marshfield ? You 've been there . What about it , Mary ? &nbsp; MARYIt 's  --  different , Jabez  --  that 's all . &nbsp; JABEZ ( looking again at is watch ) What 's the matter with ' em ? Why do n't they come ? Little Daniel comes running down the stairway , followed by Belle who is dressed elaborately for the party . Jabez does n't take any notice of the boy , being so worried . He continues to walk up and down . &nbsp; MARYDaniel , you ought to be in bed . &nbsp; WEBSTERNo , no , I do n't want to go to bed . I want to be here for the party . He runs from the room . Jabez in his walk approaches the window , where faces appear pressed against the glass . &nbsp; JABEZ ( to Belle ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want ? &nbsp; BELLEThey 're just outsiders . They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days . They 're waiting for your guests , too  --  Jabez turns away from the window and as he passes the orchestra , which has just finished a piece , he relieves his tension by shouting at them . &nbsp; JABEZConsarn it  --  I 'm paying you for playing  --  so keep on playing . The musicians hurriedly start to play another selection . But , before they can begin , a bell is heard . It cracks the silence . Jabez jumps to attention and Belle moves from the window . Mary stands stiffly , as a servant , or lackey , hurries to the great front door . The orchestra strikes up , triumphantly . A Lackey hurries to the door and opens it . A small , pinched figure in rusty  --  84  --  black , stands on the great steps . It is Stevens . He takes off his old beaver , stove-pipe hat and cringes in , stepping with an obsequious air . The Lackey takes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crosses to Mary . Mary makes a curtsy and Stevens takes her hand , eager for the warmth of it . &nbsp; MARYWelcome , Mr. Stevens  --  &nbsp; STEVENSGood evening , Mrs. Stone . Nervous and cringing , he crosses the threshold and enters the reception room . The RECEPTION ROOM : Stevens crosses to Jabez . &nbsp; STEVENSGood evening  --  I 'm sorry , Jabez  --  I 'm a little late . &nbsp; JABEZNo , you 're not . &nbsp; STEVENS ( looking around ) Where 's everybody ? &nbsp; JABEZI du n no  --  I ca n't figure it out . I 've invited them all . Why do n't they come ? &nbsp; WEBSTERThey 're all at the inn . I 've seen them . . . . Mr. Webster 's there , too . . . . The scene dissolves to the INN IN CROSS CORNERS , where Webster is sitting with Tom Sharp , Eli Higgins , Hank and a number of other farmers around a table . Webster is looking over a number of contracts  --  the same which the farmers signed with Jabez . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that foul contract you got with Jabez Stone . Hank produces a worn bit of legal paper and hands it over to Webster . Webster compares it with the other contracts . &nbsp; WEBSTERHe 's certainly made himself the big frog in the little puddle around here , has n't he ?  --  85  --  &nbsp; FARMERAnd it all looked so simple when it started  --  like getting loans for nothing . ( to Tom Sharp ) I should have listened to you , Tom . &nbsp; WEBSTER ( slowly ) Well  --  he 's got you , I 'm afraid  --  got you sewed up tight in his money pocket . Guess you 've sold your souls , gentlemen ! Section Details THE SCENE DISSOLVES TO THE RECEPTION HALL IN STONE 'S MANSION The scene dissolves to the RECEPTION HALL IN STONE 'S MANSION , where the situation has n't changed  --  no guests are there but Miser Stevens . Belle goes over to Mary who is still waiting at the foot of the stairs to play her part as the hostess . &nbsp; BELLEI see why you 're here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't . &nbsp; BELLEYou 're lying . &nbsp; MARYLying to you  --  Why should I ? &nbsp; BELLEYou know that you 're in my house . &nbsp; MARYI know  --  and you could show me the door . You would , too , if you were n't still hoping the guests might arrive . &nbsp; BELLEYou think you 're so smart , Mrs. Stone . You wanted to be near Jabez . It looked like your big chance tonight , but you 're wrong , you ca n't win him back  --  not that way . &nbsp; MARYThat 's my problem , Belle . And she walks away . Stevens is sitting at the table . Jabez sits next to him , just dismissing the little boy , Daniel .  --  86  --  &nbsp; JABEZNow run along , Daniel . &nbsp; STEVENS ( as Daniel leaves ) What a fine boy you have , Jabez . How old is he now ? &nbsp; JABEZAlmost seven . ( correcting himself quickly ) No  --  no , he 's not seven yet I am sure  --  &nbsp; STEVENSWell  --  it seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( interrupting quickly ) Oh , never mind  --  let 's have a drink . Stevens looks strangely . &nbsp; JABEZWhat 's the matter with you ? &nbsp; STEVENSYou are afraid ! &nbsp; JABEZAfraid . . . of what ? &nbsp; STEVENS --  of what happens after we die ! &nbsp; JABEZAre you plumb crazy , man ! What do you think happens ? We 're buried  --  that 's all . &nbsp; STEVENSBut what becomes of our souls ? &nbsp; JABEZWhy do you fret about something that is n't there ? &nbsp; STEVENS ( with a frantic note in his voice ) Do n't say that  --  I know it is  --   --  87  --  &nbsp; JABEZ ( swigging down another drink ) All right  --  so it 's buried with you ! &nbsp; STEVENSWhat if one has n't a soul any more ? What of that ? &nbsp; JABEZ ( disturbed ) Huh ?  --  What 's that ? ( a pause ; he gulps , then hurries on ) Well  --  what about it ? Who cares , anyhow ? &nbsp; STEVENSI do  --  and I think you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  what 's all this leading up to ? You know something . Come on ! Out with it  --  you know something about me ! At this moment they are interrupted . Men and women with common faces , the same faces we have seen behind the windows , are pouring in . Belle leads them . The guests , who have flocked around , bow to Jabez . &nbsp; JABEZ ( to Belle ) Who are these people ? &nbsp; BELLEThey are all friends of mine  --  from over the mountain . ( to the crowd ) Welcome ! Help yourselves to drinks ! Glad you could come ! Have a good time . Jabez , dumbfounded , shakes hands with people he has never seen before . Stevens is shoved aside . The orchestra begins a strange dance tune , and Belle glides over gracefully to Stevens . &nbsp; BELLELet 's dance , Mr. Stevens . &nbsp; STEVENS ( frightened ) No  --  no  --  I ca n't dance  --  &nbsp; BELLE  --  88  --  Oh , yes  --  you can dance with me . I 'll guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is all so easy  --  like that  --  ( and she takes a few steps ) You see  --  so easy  --  They begin to dance , slowly at first , around the room . Others are dancing  --  the strange , thinly-clad people in their heavy boots that clump over the fine oak floors . Mary stands in the doorway , watching miserably , seeing Jabez drinking more rum , laughing loudly  --  all this to cover his growing fears , and Mary knows that . The HALLWAY , just in front of the big outside doors : There is a rap on the door and Mary rushes to it , getting there before the lackey can . She opens the door herself and Webster comes in . &nbsp; MARY ( taking his hand ) Oh  --  Mr. Webster  --  I 'm so glad you came ! &nbsp; WEBSTER ( peering at her eager but distressed face ) Are you , Mary ? Well , I guess I 'm glad myself  --  seeing as how you feel this way . ( he looks into reception room , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( with a wry smile ) Lots of guests , anyhow . Mary looks at him and Webster sees that her eyes are moist and that her lips tremble . She might say something ; might break the shell of her New England reserve , but before that can happen , Jabez comes strutting out . His face is flushed from rum and his eyes are unnaturally bright . He comes to Webster , his hand thrust forward . &nbsp; JABEZWell  --  Mr. Webster ! This is a great day for me . Come on in , sir . I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests ! &nbsp; WEBSTERThat 's just fine , Neighbor Stone  --  but  --  I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor  --  where I sit , I mean . You see , the whole country sort of has its eye on me , Jabez  --  anybody in public life has that difficulty  --  even you , Jabez . They watch us carefully , our neighbors and our enemies , and  --  89  --  they see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more . My friends all like to think that I 've got the good of mankind always at heart , and I 've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart , too . Do you know what I 'm talking about , Jabez ? &nbsp; JABEZWhat  --  what 's on your mind ? &nbsp; WEBSTERYou , Jabez Stone  --  you and a lot of poor farmers , hereabouts  --  good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you . Or  --  am I wrong about those contracts , Mr. Stone ? &nbsp; JABEZContracts ?  --  Yes , they have contracts with me  --  lots of ' em  --  but  --  but that 's all right . Without me and my money , they would n't have anything . &nbsp; WEBSTERThey 'd have a good neighbor , Jabez  --  and that 's worth much more than anything else  --  much , much more ! Jabez laughs uproariously . Webster shakes his head with the wisdom of real sadness in his eyes . &nbsp; WEBSTERI 'm sorry you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you made a little speech once , that I 'll always remember and I know the others do too  --  They remember and they see how you have changed . That 's why they did n't want to come tonight to you , Jabez  --  you 're as blind as a Burma bat , with your gold pot ! Mind you , it 's not the money , I 've been talking about , it 's what you make of it . &nbsp; JABEZI  --  I do n't know what you 're talking about ! I  --  I have n't time to listen to all this  --  &nbsp; WEBSTER ( still shaking his head ) No  --  you have n't time  --  You have n't time for your mother , or your wife , or your child .  --  90  --  &nbsp; JABEZ ( turning on Mary ) It 's your fault ! You brought Daniel Webster here  --  just to try to make a fool of me ! You played the sneak behind my back  --  made up all sorts of lies against me ! You can get yourself out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that old place , where you belong  --  I do n't want to  --  to talk to you again ! Over his shoulder , in the doorway to the reception room , the whirling dancers pass and Belle , still dancing with Stevens , is seen for a moment . &nbsp; WEBSTER ( calmly , gently , to Mary ) Come along , Mary  --  Mary goes to him and they move to the door . Little Daniel , frightened by the strange , motley dancers comes running out of the reception room into the hall . &nbsp; MARYDaniel  --  you come with me . Mary takes his hand . Webster , Mary and Daniel go out of the house ; down the stairs and the doors close with a bang . Jabez turns and calls into the reception room where amidst the other guests , Belle dances with Stevens . &nbsp; JABEZBelle ! She does n't listen  --  the music is playing faster and louder . &nbsp; JABEZ ( to a footman ) Close the windows and make a fire . ( as the footman leaves ) Belle ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns around and sees Scratch standing in the doorway to the reception room . &nbsp; SCRATCHWhy , Mr. Stone , you look so worried . Can I be of any service ? &nbsp; JABEZ ( facing Scratch )  --  91  --  You promised me prosperity , happiness , love , money , friendship  --  &nbsp; SCRATCH ( interrupting ) Just a minute , neighbor Stone . I promised you money and all that money can buy . I do n't recall any other obligations . But let 's look at the contract . He takes out a large black pocketbook , stuffed with paper . He flicks papers over , reading the names : &nbsp; SCRATCHSherwin , Slattery , Stevens , Stone  --  But something has fluttered from his pocketbook  --  a small white thing that looks like a moth  --  the soul of Miser Stevens . It flutters toward Jabez . Jabez catches it in his hand and closing his fingers , holds it tightly . A thin small voice is heard  --  the soul of Miser Stevens , speaking from Jabez 's hand . &nbsp; SOUL OF STEVENSNeighbor ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) That 's Miser Stevens ' voice !  --  Miser Stevens  --  &nbsp; SCRATCH ( smiling ) . . . . Miser Stevens ' soul , Mr. Stone . Yes  --  I am sorry for the disturbance . &nbsp; JABEZHe ai n't dead  --  he 's dancing in there . &nbsp; SCRATCHHe was  --  He steps near and drapes a big bandana handkerchief over Jabez 's hand and transfers the soul to the handkerchief , and starts tying the ends together . Jabez looks into the reception room . It 's empty , except for the dead body of Stevens lying on the floor . &nbsp; SCRATCHIn the midst of life  --  one really hates to close these long standing accounts . But business is business . Jabez 's eyes fix on the bandana.  --  92  --  &nbsp; JABEZ ( hoarsely ) Are they all as  --  small  --  as that ? &nbsp; SCRATCHSmall ? Oh , I see what you mean . Why , they vary . ( looking at Jabez ) Now a man like Daniel Webster , if I ever get hold of him , I 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , I imagine , the wing spread would be astonishing . ( looking again at Jabez ) In your case  --  &nbsp; JABEZMy time is n't up yet . And , as he turns around , the scene changes quickly , to the STONE FARM at the blasted tree that bears the date of Jabez 's doom . Jabez is hacking blindly at the tree trunk with an ax . He is making little headway . Mr. Scratch is standing beside him . &nbsp; SCRATCHTrying to break our contract again , Mr. Stone ? &nbsp; JABEZ ( furiously hacking away ) I 'm through with you . &nbsp; SCRATCHWhat a headstrong fellow ! Well  --  I guess you 're quite prepared to suffer the consequences . &nbsp; JABEZI have still a year  --  a year to make up for everything . &nbsp; SCRATCHOh no , you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now , if I chose . &nbsp; JABEZ ( desperately ) Not now ! Not now !  --  Let me make up  --  let me make up . &nbsp; SCRATCHSuddenly you seem quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 93  --   --  You know I 'm a good-natured man . I 'm always open to reason . With a little security  --  I might --  &nbsp; JABEZAnything  --  anything .  --  You can have it all back  --  that money  --  the new house  --  my farm  --  the whole caboodle ! &nbsp; SCRATCHI 'm afraid that 's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of  --  ( after a pause ) You see  --  there is that promising little fellow , your son . . . &nbsp; JABEZ ( violently ) No ! No ! No ! Not him  --  not my son  --  I 'd rather go with you  --  right now . &nbsp; SCRATCHCome , come , Mr. Stone , you are a little upset . It 's not fair to bargain with you now .  --  I 'll give you until midnight , Mr. Stone , but not one minute more . Ah , then you 'll come with me indeed . And Scratch disappears . Jabez turns and runs from the tree , off into the night , in the direction of the old farmhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dark , forlorn-looking , almost desolate in contrast to the false gaiety of the mansion . We follow Jabez as he comes running from the tree , along the path to the house . He bursts into the kitchen door . Now we see Jabez INSIDE THE FARMHOUSE as he runs upstairs into the bedroom , calling frantically . &nbsp; JABEZDaniel ! . . . Daniel ! Mary ! He looks frantically about ; he calls again and runs downstairs , as the scene moves with him into the kitchen . It , too , is empty and dark . He calls once more : &nbsp; JABEZMary ! . . . Daniel ! The scene moves with him as he runs outside . Jabez then comes running out , more wildly than ever ; this time in the direction of the barn .  --  94  --  In the OLD BARN , where Jabez first met Mr. Scratch . Jabez comes running in . He pauses , panting ; he looks about him , helplessly , hopelessly . &nbsp; JABEZ ( desperate ) Mary . . . Daniel . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel and buries his head in his hands , groaning in mortal agony . Ma Stone enters from the rear door . She carries a smudged lantern . &nbsp; MA STONEMy son . . . what 's the matter ? &nbsp; JABEZ ( looking up ) Ma ! . . . ( jumping up and going to her ) Where 's Mary . . . and little Dan'l ? &nbsp; MA STONEGone with Daniel Webster  --  to Marshfield , son . . . . You told Mary to go --  She stops , not wishing to add to his pain , but looks at his twisted face with great understanding and compassion . Jabez turns to one of the stalls and brings out a horse . Ma Stone holding up the lantern , he leaps on the horse and rides off . Now there are views of : A STRETCH OF ROAD IN THE DIRECTION OF MARSHFIELD as Webster , with Mary and Daniel beside him on the front seat of the carriage , is driving on toward Marshfield . ANOTHER PART OF THE ROAD , farther back , with Jabez riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SECTION OF THE SAME ROAD as Jabez catches up to Webster 's carriage . Mary sits beside Webster , holding the boy in her lap . &nbsp; JABEZMr . Webster . . . Wait ! . . . ( as Webster slows down , and Jabez rides up ) Mary ! &nbsp; MARY ( turning on front seat ; with a glad cry ) Jabez ! &nbsp; JABEZ  --  95  --  Mary ! Come back . . . &nbsp; MARY ( happily to Jabez ) Oh , Jabez ! . . . ( to Webster ) Did you hear , Mr. Webster ?  --  Now you 'll help him , wo n't you ? &nbsp; WEBSTERI 'll fight ten thousand devils to save a New Hampshire man . Webster turns the horses about and starts back . pp. 62-77 &nbsp; pp. 96-109 THE SCENE DISSOLVES TO THE EXTERIOR AND THE INTERIOR OF JABEZ 'S OLD BARN The scene dissolves to the EXTERIOR AND THE INTERIOR OF JABEZ 'S OLD BARN , a Short time later : Jabez and Webster , making their way through a crowd of farmers , enter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by the uncertain light from a farm lantern . The corners , loft and stalls are pools of night . &nbsp; WEBSTERIt 's here you said that you closed the deal with him ? &nbsp; JABEZYes , Mr. Webster  --  it was here where it all began . &nbsp; WEBSTERI see . And this is where he 'd like to collect , too . &nbsp; JABEZYes  --  at midnight . &nbsp; MARY ( coming in through the front door ) Jabez . . . &nbsp; WEBSTER ( coming over to Mary , stopping her at the door ) Mary  --  what love and trust could do for your husband , you 've done . And frankly , in a very few moments , this is going to be no place for a lady . &nbsp; MARYMr . Webster  --  you will help him ?  --  96  --  &nbsp; WEBSTERI 'll do my best , Mary . &nbsp; JABEZYou must go now , Mary  --  you must ! &nbsp; MARYAll right , Jabez . . . She turns and exits quickly . &nbsp; WEBSTERThey make plucky women in New England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lantern ) H 'm . . . how long have we to wait ? &nbsp; JABEZ ( trying to control himself ; looking at his watch ) Not long  --  now . &nbsp; WEBSTER ( going over to feed-bin where a dusty jug reposes in the hay ) Then I 'll just christen the jug , with your permission , Stone . Somehow or other , waiting 's wonderfully shorter with a jug . He takes the jug over to a plank laid between two saw-horses and pours himself a drink into one of the cups Mary brought . He tastes it . &nbsp; WEBSTERH 'm  --  old Medford . He smacks his lips ; sits down on a barreltop . There are a few other barrels placed about the crude table . &nbsp; WEBSTERThere 's nothing like it . I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once , and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee . Come  --  try a nip ! &nbsp; JABEZThere 's no joy in it for me . &nbsp; WEBSTEROh , come , man , come . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need n't make you a teetotaler.  --  97  --  He takes another swig of Medford . There is a knock at the rear door ; a subtle kind of knock that is different from anything else of its kind . &nbsp; WEBSTERCome in . Scratch enters . He carries his collecting-box under his arm . &nbsp; SCRATCH ( suavely ) Mr. Webster , I presume ? &nbsp; WEBSTERAttorney of record for Jabez Stone . Might I ask your name ? &nbsp; SCRATCHScratch will do for the evening . May I  --  join you ? He slides easily onto a barrel-top by the makeshift table and pours a drink from the jug then lifts his cup and toasts Jabez and Webster silently . He drinks deeply . &nbsp; WEBSTERWhy , certainly  --  but be careful , Mr. Scratch  --  Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back , even with old-timers like yourself . ( he sips his Medford ) &nbsp; SCRATCH ( with a soft chuckle ) It even kicked back  --  once at you , did n't it ? &nbsp; WEBSTER ( professing indignant surprise ) Me ? &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , indeed ! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or , more plainly , a deep and enveloping sleep . &nbsp; WEBSTERThere is n't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy . ( he deliberately drinks again ) &nbsp; SCRATCHTalk has never proved that question , Mr. Webster !  --  98  --  ( he drains his cup ) Cup for cup  --  what do you say ? &nbsp; WEBSTER ( immediately ) Cup for cup ! They pour and drink and smack their lips at each other . &nbsp; SCRATCHWell now , Mr. Stone , did you make up your mind ? &nbsp; JABEZAbout what ? &nbsp; SCRATCHAre you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract ? &nbsp; JABEZNever ! The STONE FARMHOUSE KITCHEN where Ma Stone is busy making a pie . Mary stands by the window . She turns from it as little Daniel comes running downstairs in his nightgown and bare feet . &nbsp; WEBSTERMama ! &nbsp; MARYDaniel ! . . . You must go to sleep . &nbsp; WEBSTER ( throwing his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there all alone , Mama . . . . I want to be with you . &nbsp; MARYAll right , darling . Voices are heard outside , and there is a quick rap at the window . &nbsp; MA STONE ( to Mary ) You see who it is . I have to get my pie in the oven . Mary opens the door . There are Tom Sharp and a few farmers outside . &nbsp; TOM SHARPJabez 's new house is a-burning down !  --  99  --  &nbsp; MA STONE ( calling from the stove ) Well , you just let it alone . . . the consarn thing oughter burn ! She closes the window on their astonished faces , and turns to Mary with her head tossing and her lips pursed . The BARN , with Webster and Scratch still drinking . With a chuckle , Scratch rises , perfectly steady on his nimble legs . Webster sits at the table , a trifle slumped . &nbsp; SCRATCHYour spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit , Mr. Webster  --  If you have no more arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WEBSTERNot so fast , Mr. Scratch . Produce your evidence  --  if you have it . &nbsp; SCRATCH ( taking out the pocketbook ) There , Mr. Webster . ( passing it to him ) All open and above-board and in due and legal form . &nbsp; WEBSTER ( looking over the deed ) H 'm . This appears  --  I say appears  --  to be properly drawn . But you shall not have this man ! A man is n't property ! Mr. Stone is an American citizen , and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince . &nbsp; SCRATCHForeign ? And who calls me a foreigner ? &nbsp; WEBSTERWell , I never heard the dev --  of your claiming American citizenship . &nbsp; SCRATCHAnd who with better right ? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian , I was there . When the first slaver put out for the Congo , I stood on the deck . Am I not spoken of , still , in every church in New England ? ' T is true , the  --  100  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a Northerner , but I am neither . To tell the truth , Mr. Webster , though I do n't like to boast of it , my name is older in the country than yours . &nbsp; WEBSTERThen I stand on the Constitution ! I demand a trial for my client . &nbsp; SCRATCHYou mean  --  a jury trial ? &nbsp; WEBSTERI do ! If I ca n't win this case with a jury , you shall have me , too . If two New Hampshire men are n't a match for the devil , we 'd better give this country back to the Indians . &nbsp; SCRATCH ( smiling ) Very well .  --  You shall have your trial , Mr. Webster . The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury  --  &nbsp; WEBSTERLet it be the quick or the dead  --  So it is an American judge and an American jury ! &nbsp; SCRATCHThe quick or the dead ! You have said it . ( he raises the cup again to Webster ) May  --  the best man win , Mr. Webster ! &nbsp; WEBSTERI 'll drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also . Both drink deeply , Scratch watching Webster closely , to see the effect . Then Scratch goes to a door in a dark corner of the floor that opens into a cellar . He throws the door back and a black hole yawns at his feet . A ruffian in pioneer dress , Captain Kidd , appears , others follow . &nbsp; SCRATCHYou must pardon the leathery toughness of one or two . . . Captain Kidd  --  he killed a man for gold ; Simon Girty  --  the renegade ; he burned men for gold ; Governor Dale  --  he broke men on the wheel ; Asa , the Black Monk  --  he choked them to death ; Floyd Ireson and Stede Bonnet , the fiendish butchers ; Walter Butler  --  the  --  101  --  King of the Massacre ; Big and Little Harp  --  robbers and murderers ; Teach , the Cutthroat ; Morton , the vicious lawyer . . . and . . .

But thou , O Lord , shalt endure forever ; and thy remembrance unto all generations .

The Devil versus Jabez Stone ! &nbsp; HAWTHORNEWho appears for the plaintiff ? &nbsp; SCRATCHI , Your Honor . &nbsp; HAWTHORNEAnd for the defendant ? &nbsp; WEBSTERI . &nbsp; HAWTHORNEAre you content with the jury , Mr. Webster ?  --  102  --  &nbsp; WEBSTERI object to General Benedict Arnold , Your Honor , for being a flagrant traitor to the great American cause . . . . &nbsp; HAWTHORNE ( cutting it short ) Objection denied ! The prosecution will proceed . &nbsp; SCRATCH ( stepping out briskly ) Your Honor  --  gentlemen of the jury  --  this case need not detain us long . It concerns one thing alone  --  the transference , barter and sale of a certain piece of property , to wit , his soul by Jabez Stone . That transference , barter or sale is attested by a deed . I offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WEBSTERI object . &nbsp; HAWTHORNEObjection denied . Mark it Exhibit A. Scratch hands the deed to the clerk who hands it to Hawthorne . &nbsp; SCRATCHI shall now call Jabez Stone to the witness stand . &nbsp; CLERKJabez Stone to the witness stand ! Webster gives Jabez an encouraging pat on the hack , and Jabez takes his place in the witness stand , which is an empty corn-crib . He looks scared . The eyes of the jury fasten upon him . &nbsp; SCRATCHJabez Stone  --  did you or did you not sign this document ? &nbsp; JABEZ ( sweating ) Yes , I did  --  but you tricked me into signing it ! You told me my soul was nothing . . . that I could forget all about a soul , in exchange for money . That was a lie , a lie , a lie . &nbsp; SCRATCH ( only smiling )  --  103  --  That is highly irrelevant to this case , Your Honor . &nbsp; HAWTHORNE ( nodding sagely ) Leave out the soul . Proceed . &nbsp; SCRATCHI would like to ask Mr. Stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract ? Did n't I give you seven years of good luck and prosperity ? Did n't I make you the richest man in the country ? &nbsp; JABEZYes  --  yes , I am the richest man  --  too rich . I ca n't think of anything but money . That 's the trouble with me . &nbsp; SCRATCH ( smiling ) But , Mr. Stone , I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience . ( he holds out deed ) Is this your signature ? &nbsp; JABEZ ( almost shouting ) You know darn well it is . &nbsp; SCRATCH ( turning to the jury ) Gentlemen , the prosecution rests . &nbsp; HAWTHORNEDoes the jury wish to consider the case ? They do not speak . &nbsp; HAWTHORNEIt appears they do not . Take your man , Mr. Scratch . Scratch moves toward Jabez who shrinks back . The jury sits motionless . &nbsp; WEBSTERI protest , Your Honor ! I wish to cross-examine  --  to prove  --  &nbsp; HAWTHORNEThere will be no cross-examination in this  --  104  --  court ! &nbsp; SCRATCHYour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not let him speak .

( as Webster steps forward ) And let me warn you , Mr. Webster  --  if you speak and fail to convince us , then you , too  --  ( pointing his finger )  --  are doomed ! There now appears a close view of Daniel Webster . His face shows his struggle to concentrate . &nbsp; VOICES OF JURYDrag him down with us  --  Drag him down with us . &nbsp; JABEZ 'S VOICESave yourself , Mr. Webster  --  Do n't speak ! &nbsp; SCRATCH 'S VOICE ( ironically ) " There is n't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy .

The timbre of his mighty voice stops the murmur , and the music and bell strokes recede .

They stare back at him , eyes fixed , and Benedict Arnold starts to  --  105  --  raise his head . &nbsp; WEBSTERMy worthy opponent , Mr. Scratch , has called you Americans all , and Mr. Scratch was right  --  you were Americans all ! Oh , what a heritage you were born to share ! Gentlemen of the jury , I envy you ! For you were there at the birth of a mighty Union . It was given to you to hear those first cries of pain  --  and to behold the shining babe that was born of blood and tears . Tonight , you are called upon to judge a man named Jabez Stone . What is his case ? He is accused of breach of contract  --  He made a deal to find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . The same deal all of you once made . ( a pause ) You , Benedict Arnold ! . . . I speak to you first , because you 're better known than all your other colleagues here . What a different song yours could have been ! A friend of Washington and LaFayette  --  a soldier  --  General Arnold , you fought so gallantly for the American cause , till  --  What was the date ? Oh , yes  --  in 1779 , a date burned in your heart . Arnold bows his head again . &nbsp; WEBSTERThe lure of gold made you betray that cause . Another pause as his words sink in ; then he whirls about and points at Simon Girty . &nbsp; WEBSTERYou , Simon Girty , now known to all as Renegade ! A loathsome word  --  you also took that other way . ( steps along the jury box ) You , Walter Butler  --  What would you give to have another chance to let the grasses grow in Cherry Valley without the stain of blood ?  --  You , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could go on and name you all , but there 's no need of that . Why stir the wounds ? I know they pain enough . ( his voice rises ) All of you were fooled like Jabez Stone  --  fooled and trapped in your desire to rebel against your fate . Gentlemen of the jury  --   --  106  --  it 's the eternal right of man to raise his fist against his fate , but every time he does he stands at crossroads . You took the wrong turn and so did Jabez Stone . But he found out in time . He is here tonight to save his soul . Gentlemen of the jury , I ask that you give Jabez Stone another chance to walk upon the earth , among  --  the trees , the growing corn , the smell of grass in spring  --  What would you give for one more chance to see those things that you must all remember and often long to feel again ? For you were all men once . Clean American air was in your lungs  --  you breathed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth you loved . These are common things I speak of , small things , but they are good things . Yet without your soul they are nothing . Without your soul they sicken . Mr. Scratch told you that your soul is nothing and you believed him . It has cost you your freedom . Freedom is not just a big word  --  it is the bread and the morning and the risen sun . It was for freedom we came in boats and ships to these shores . It has been a long journey , a hard one , a bitter one . There is sadness in being a man , but it is a proud thing , too . Out of the suffering and the starvation , the wrong and the right , a new thing has come , a free man . When the whips of the oppressors are broken , and their names forgotten and destroyed , free men will be walking and talking under a free star . Yes , we have planted freedom here in this earth like wheat . We have said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own soul . " Now  --  here is this man  --  He is your brother ! You are Americans all , you cannot --  ( pointing at the devil )  --  take his side  --  the side of the oppressor . Let Jabez Stone keep his soul  --  this soul which does n't belong to him alone , which belongs to his son  --  his family  --  his country . Gentlemen of the jury  --  do n't let this country go to the devil ! Free Jabez Stone ! God save the United States and the men who have made her free ! A long pause . The jury does not stir . Webster steps back , goes to the table and sits down , quietly . The pause holds for a moment longer , and then Hawthorne speaks : &nbsp; HAWTHORNE  --  107  --  The jury will consider its verdict . He hands the deed to the FOREMAN of the jury . They form a little circle and put their heads together . Jabez looks at them , the sweat of his agony in beads on his forehead . Scratch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreman tears up the deed . &nbsp; HAWTHORNEThe jury finds for the defendant . A long-drawn crow of a cock is heard . &nbsp; SCRATCH ( wryly to Webster ) My congratulations  --  as between two gentlemen . &nbsp; WEBSTER ( catching Scratch by the collar ) Why , you long-barreled , slab-sided , lantern-jawed , note-shaving crook , be off with you . . . He runs Scratch to the door and kicks him out . The YARD OUTSIDE OF THE BARN : Morning light is shining . Scratch is tearing out of the barn . He turns and calls back : &nbsp; SCRATCHYou 'll never be president  --  I 'll see to that ! He practically thumbs his nose . But the farmers rush in and chase Scratch out through the gate . He runs wildly down the road . IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE BARN DOOR : Mary is just flinging her arms around Jabez . &nbsp; MARYJabez  --  Jabez ! &nbsp; JABEZMary ! &nbsp; WEBSTERYou were worried , Jabez , were n't you ? &nbsp; JABEZWell , I  --  &nbsp; WEBSTERI know  --  that was mighty queer Medford  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes more than that to down Daniel Webster .  --  108  --  &nbsp; MARY ( turning to him and clasping his hands ) You 've done it , Mr. Webster  --  God bless you ! And as they stand together , Jabez runs toward the house . OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN , Ma Stone is busy setting the breakfast table that is under an apple tree in the yard . Jabez comes running to her gleefully , like a boy let loose from school . &nbsp; JABEZMa  --  Ma  --  it 's all right , Ma ! &nbsp; MA STONE ( still busy with her table , in matter-of-fact tone ) Of course it 's all right , son . You had Daniel Webster , did n't ye ? ( calling out loudly ) Breakfast 's ready ! ( to Jabez ) I 've made a special surprise for Mr. Webster . The EXTERIOR OF JABEZ STONE 'S FARM , near the old barn . Webster , with the jug of Medford rum under his arm , is surrounded by the farmers including Tom Sharp , and Eli Higgins . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Dan'l ! &nbsp; WEBSTERDo n't make so much of a trifle , my friends ! &nbsp; JABEZ ( joining the group ) Ma says breakfast 's ready , Mr. Webster ! &nbsp; WEBSTERBreakfast . . . Ah ! . . . Come along friends , Ma Stone 's a cook this side of heaven . He hooks his arm into Jabez 's and they go up toward the house . Tom Sharp walks next to Jabez . OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN as they all sit down . Webster is at the head of the table , the jug of Medford beside his chair . Jabez sits next to Mary , and next to Mary sits little Daniel . &nbsp; TOM SHARP  --  109  --  Jabez  --  will you join our Grange now ? &nbsp; JABEZWhy , thank you , Tom . I was going to ask you if you thought I could . &nbsp; TOM SHARPWe 'll be mighty glad to have you with us . &nbsp; WEBSTERThere is nothing like a good old country breakfast . Where 's Ma ? &nbsp; MARYShe 'll be here in a moment . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a huge covered dish from the kitchen and sets it before Webster with pride . &nbsp; WEBSTER ( sniffing it ) Peach pie ! Ma smiles , but does n't answer . Webster lifts the cover and finds an empty dish . Everybody is dumbfounded . &nbsp; MA STONEWhat the D --  ? And on CROSS ROADS we see Scratch , in his buggy , holding a big peach pie in his hands and munching it lustily as the scene fades out . pp. 78-95 &nbsp;
