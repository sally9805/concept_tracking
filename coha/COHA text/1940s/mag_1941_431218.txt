 | Young lovers in the moonlight always plan to tell each other everything for the rest of their lives . That is instinctively right and beautiful , because the success of marriage depends on the radiant , open-hearted trust that husband and wife have in each other . However , if you are a wise wife , you soon learn there are things not to tell your husband . You should not tell hiii your friends ' secrets . Your friends have confided in you , not in your husband , and telling him is a betrayal of their trust . Moreover , the secrets may not seem so exciting to him . This goes for your family 's secrets , too . If your mother is having trouble with your sister , keep it dark . A whole lot of in-law trouble would be avoided if a wife never repeated bosom-of-thefamily confidences . Of course you want to keep an atmosphere of romance in your home . All women do . You want to be , in your husband 's eyes , the lovely creature he first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . One way is not to tell your husband too many physical details about yourself . Spare him the blow-by-blow account of your latest battle with indigestion . Do n't launch into a long description of your headaches . With every description , you 'll take away some of the mystery and charm that should always surround you . You should keep still , too , about your old romances . A gentleman is not supposed to boast of his conquests , and a lady should not boast of hers . Nothing shows poorer taste than a wife 's recital of the men she might have married . And nothing bores a husband faster . Maybe , too , all those romances were not happy . Maybe you were jilted . Keep it to yourself . If you tell your husband about your failures with men , it may make him feel that perhaps you are n't such a prize package after all . Discreet silence will make you all the more desirable . Silence means tremendous selfcontrol . Especially when you see your husband flirting with another woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , such flirtations usually burn themselves out . Your speaking may give them a perilous emphasis . Besides , there is always the danger of misjudging your husband . One of the chief causes of marital woe is an overjealous wife 's conversation , on the way home from a party , beginning : " I think the fuss you made over that Mrs. Harris was simply disgusting . " Such talk is beneath your dignity as a wife . You should feel secure , above small rivalries . By so feeling and behaving , you enhance your own serene importance in your husband 's eyes . Of course , there might come a time , a heartbreaking time , when you realize that your husband 's flirtation with another woman is something more serious . Then you should tell your husband that you know about the situation ; but only if you are prepared to do something about it . You should not tell him for the sake of making a scene . If you are willing to overlook it , you should do a good big job of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend to take definite , drastic action . A husband wo n't be nearly so likely to get overinterested in other women if you build yourself up in his eyes as a wife worth having , as a successful human being . In other words , do n't run yourself down to your husband . There is great comfort in telling your beloved some of the mistakes you 've made , and getting his sympathy . But do n't do it too often . Do n't plant in his mind the idea that you are not capable of handling life . He wishes and needs to be proud of you . Nor should you tell him all the woes of the day the minute he gets home from business . Do n't greet him with : " I 've had a terrible day ! The most awful things happened ! " Domestic difficulties are your job to handle by yourself ; but if there is something you must tell him , wait till after dinner . Evenings are very important . They can make or break a marriage , depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable , relaxed . One of the ways to keep it so is not to tell your husband the unpleasant things you may have heard about him , - unless he really should be told for his own self-protection , and that rarely happens . Be particularly careful not to repeat any criticisms your family may have made . Do n't say , " Mother thinks you talk too much , " or , " Father says you were n't very pleasant the last time he saw you . " That leads to infinite in-law trouble . Above all , you should never tell your husband anything that may seriously wound his pride . A man 's pride is like a house plant ; it must be carefully tended every day . Always it should be taken seriously , because he faces the world with it . Faith-in-himself is an essential part of his equipment , just like his brain or his hands . One of the chief efforts of your married life should be to keep your husband 's pride bright and intact , to build him up in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , too . Maybe he wo n't say anything to you about it ; but every time you wound your husband 's pride , you arouse his resentment . This feeling may be conscious or unconscious ; but if it continues , it will destroy his love for you and , eventually , your marriage . Silence is n't easy . But a discreet amount is necessary to your happiness . Of course , as all women know , silence works both ways . There are things a husband should not tell a wife ; but that is another story .
