To most nations in all wars have come days filled with a succession of campaigns that were costly and not going well . Now , more than at any time since 1863 , America knew such days . <P> The news pictures brought a quick and intimate sense of struggle : the grim face of Vice Admiral William F. Halsey , the new commander , surrounded by his staff ( see cut ) ; the fuzzy young faces and grizzled old faces of marines in foxholes ; the bodies of Japs , looking menacing even in death , on the river banks . Though Guadalcanal was 6,000 miles away , it now seemed as close as the next block . <P> Yet there were great gaps in the nation 's picture of the Solomons-some due to the very uncertainty of pitched battle , some to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 61 ) .

" <P> Said OWI Director Elmer Davis : " The willingness to accept wildly exaggerated rumor in place of fact is doubtless due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon today Oct. 28 , when I last talked to Navy representatives , all sinkings of major United States vessels have been reported . " <P> Said a Navy communiqu : another carrier had been sunk Oct. 26 . ( The Navy Department had either not known or had not told Elmer Davis . ) <P> The statements of the leaders reflected the hopes and fears of the people . Men looked with suspicion now at the planning that had gone into the Solomons campaign , they looked closely at their military high command , they doubted Army-Navy cooperation . Above all , they had lost for the time being their once unqualified faith in the news that the high command gave them of the battle . <P> Stirrings Above . Elmer Davis said : " Whatever may be the shortcomings of the men at the head of our Navy with regard to keeping the public informed , their primary job is to fight and win the war . . .
