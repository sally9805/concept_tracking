After months of crisis , Socialist delegates from all over Italy gathered last week at their 28th National Socialist Congress in Rome to choose between 1 ) Communism , which is Socialism 's most extreme form , and 2 ) moderate Socialism , which is democracy 's most extreme compromise . Communism won . <P> For nearly two years , Socialist Boss Pietro Nenni had carried on his policy of collaboration with the Communists . Eventually it must lead to complete fusion , but Nenni first needed a showdown with the anti-Communist elements in his party . As the Congress opened last week , Communist observer Umberto Terracini put it this way : " We have come here as to the house of a brother in need who is entering the crisis of a most grave sickness and who must make an irrevocable decision . " <P> TIME Correspondent Emmet Hughes reported how that decision was reached : <P> In Rome University 's august Aula Magna ( Great Hall ) , eleven spotlights probed the platform where Socialist leaders fretfully shuffled back &; forth under a huge wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian Socialist emblem ) . Delegates , observers and guests , filling the unheated auditorium to capacity , shivered in their overcoats . Pietro Nenni sat snugly at the rear of the platform , carefully concealed from view by a bowl of bright red carnations . <P> Fear &; Terrorism . The first dramatic moment of the dramatic session came when Matteo Matteotti , 25 , son of Italy 's famous anti-Fascist martyr ( TIME , Aug. 7 , 1944 ) , moved to the speaker 's microphone . His wide mouth and slightly jutting jaw firmly set , his deep-set eyes solemn and stern , young Matteotti charged Nenni 's party leadership with spreading " fear and terrorism , " and denounced the Congress as illegal . The delegates rose and screamed : " Degenerate son ! " But Matteotti doggedly finished his job , handed the presiding officer what he called documentation proving Nenni 's terroristic methods , and calmly walked off the platform and out of the Congress . With him , the whole Iniziativa Socialista bloc of ardent young Trotskyites bolted the party . <P> A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's round , smiling face emerged from behind the carnations . In a grey chalk-stripe suit with a tan shirt and a red silk tie , carefully disarranged to avoid any appearance of bourgeois neatness , he spent two hours and twelve minutes in passionate exhortation . As Nenni 's voice rose &; fell in practiced intonation , while he raised a warning finger , clenched his right fist , grandly embraced Congress in widespread arms , or modestly spread his long , strong fingers against his chest in a self-effacing gesture , men &; women stared seriously and intensely , many with mouths agape as if to suck in the meaning of the precious words . <P> The words were eloquent , but studded with cliches about unity of the proletariat , relentless class struggle , economic as well as political liberty . Nenni carefully balanced a tribute to British Socialism with a salute to the Russian Revolution . The audience greeted the first silently and the second with wild applause .                   @ @
