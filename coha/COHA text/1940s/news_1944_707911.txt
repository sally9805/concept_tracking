txt Mayor La Guardia unveiled his " transportation tax " plan yesterday in his weekly radio broadcast from City Hall . Designed to raise an estimated $51,700,000 a year to cover the cost of subway deficits and transit improvements , the proposal calls for a levy on all rent payers and owner-occupants in residential , business and commercial buildings , supplemented by a tax on mortgage interest and an impost on all persons employed in the city but living elsewhere . The plan would be placed before the Board of Estimate and the City Council after the November election , the Mayor said , and the , 1945 Legislature would be asked to pass an enabling act under which the plan , together with a ten-cent fare proposal , would come before ' the voters at a special referendum election before July 1 , 1915 . Outline of the Plan As outlined by the Mayor , the " transportation tax " plan calls for ' the following : A tax of 2 per cent on rents of residential properties , to be paid by the tenants and collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax of 2 per cent on charges for rooms in hotels and lodging houses , to be paid and collected in similar fashion . A tax of 23 per cent on rents in other than residential properties , also to be paid by the tenant and colleCteelittlie landlord for payment to the city treasury . A tax of 2 per cent on owneroccupants , based on rental value of the occupied premises as computed by a formula not disclosed by the Mayor , but apparently fixing monthly rental value at 1 per cent of aksessed valuation . A tax of 1 per cent on mortgage interest , to be paid by the person or institution receiving the interest . A tax of 40 cents a week on all persons working in the city but living elsewhere , to be withheld by employers for payment to the city . " The total transportation tax collections would yield about $51 , - 700,000 , " the Mayor said . " I feel that this total has been very conservatively estimated , taking into consideration the 619,462 residential buildings and the 63,619 warehouses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , loft buildings , office buildings and miscellaneous buildings . " Resort to a " transportation tax " to take the burden of the annual subway deficit  --  now at $41,118,808 ? off the shoulders of real estate taxpayers was suggested by the Mayor in his annual budget message to the Board of Estimate on April 1 . The deficit , he declared , would reach $50,000,000 in the next two or three years and the problem must be solved at once because would set the city 's transit financ- ' ing policy " for the next twenty or twenty-five years . " Revenue Is Estimated The tax on rents , the Mayor said , would yield about $44,500,000 annually , at a conservative estimate , with the likelihood that the levy on non-residential rents might Soon be reduced to 2 per cent . He estirpated the mortgage interest tax yield at $2,000,000 and thought the annual revenue from the tax on non-residents would approximate $5,200,000 . This tax would apply to the many commuters who now get the benefit of the 5-cent fare on city transit lines without contributing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Estimate and the City Council would be required , the Mayor said , before the Legislature could pass the enabling act authorizing the taxes and directing the referendum vote . The ballot , he suggested , might carry his plan and the 10-cent fare proposal advocated by many civic organizations . If both proposals were voted down , the present Scent fare would remain in force . If both proposals received affirmative pluralities , the one with the larger plurality would prevail . If the " transportation tax " plan won it , the 5-cent fare would be retained , but the burden of its support would be shifted . Declaring that he was under no illusions about the unpopularity of any new taxes , the Mayor said the transit deficit situation had reached the acute stage and that it could not be solved by silence . Money was lacking , he said , for new cars and for proper maintenance , and the post-war period held prospects for increased operating expenses and lower revenues . Post-war improvements already planned , he declare , would add at least $3,500,000 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be reached in two or three years , " without a foot of new lines . " All proceeds from the new taxes , the Mayor declared , would be earmarked for transportation purposes and could not be used for anything else . The revenues would be applied first to the subway deficit . Any balance would first be applied to meet deficits in the city 's ferry service and if any funds were still available , they would go into a special transportation improvement fund , to be used either as capital or as carrying charges for future improvements . Expects Attacks on Plan The Mayor said he expected his plan to arouse criticism and " even controversy . " He reserved the right , he added , of accepting a better and more easily collected tax if one were brought forward . In the meantime , he said , his plan seemed to make possible the raising of the necessary funds with the least possible cost of collection and administration , within the limited fields of taxation available in the face of Federal and State pre-emption of revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their families used the city transit lines at least twice a day , twenty-six days a month , the Mayor cited a number of comparisons . A family paying $30 a month rent , he said , would pay a transportation tax of ' 60 cents a month , as contrasted with the $2.60 a month a 5-centfare rise would cost a worker member of the family . This would mean a monthly saving of $2 , augmented by an additional $2.60 for each additional member of the family group . In the case of owner-occupants , the Mayor said , there would be the direct benefit of a reduced tax rate if all of the existing subway deficit was met by the new tax . They also would avoid the increased expense of a higher fare . Effect on Home-Owners The Mayor cited an example of application of the new tax to owner-occupied premises . Elimination of the subway deficit , he said , would mean a 27-point cut in taxes . On an assessed valuation of $5,000 , this would result in a saving of $1.121/2 a month on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be $1 a month . To the saving of 121/2 cents a month would be added $2.60 a month , representing the difference between the cost of a nickel fare and a 10-cent ride , for every member of a family who was working . The $51,700,000 transportation tax , the Mayor declared , was preferable to a 10-cent fare , even though the latter course meant $125,000,000 a year more in revenue . " The $125,000,000 would come from one source , " he said , " and establishes a charge over and above the cost of transporation , while relieving a large number of taxpayers from their just share of carrying the burden of running the City of NeW York . " I feel that the $51,700,000 will relieve the present taxpayers of an . amount used exclusively for the traveling public as well as commerce and industry , and the transportation tax distributes this cost to all who derive a benefit . Naturally , any administration would like to get $75,000,000,000 more , but the amount that can be collected is not the test . The test is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of a community ; how much can be equitably taxed and how can the tax be more justly and honestly distributed . " Hence my preference for a transportation tax , paid by everybody in the city and raising $51 , - 700,000 , rather than the $125,000 , - 000 paid by only those who use the subways , 90 per cent of whom are working for a weekly or monthly wage .
