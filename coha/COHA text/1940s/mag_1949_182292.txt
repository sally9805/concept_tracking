Quartet ( Rank ; Eagle Lion ) , British cinema 's talent-studded gift to Somerset Maugham on his 75th birthday , is a neatly packaged film based on four unrelated Maugham short stories . Expertly scripted by R. C. Sherriff ( Odd Man Out , This Above All , etc. ) and urbanely introduced by Author Maugham himself , it also makes a handsomely mounted gift for moviegoers who do n't insist on all the Hollywood formulas . <P> Story No. i ( The Facts of Life ) is a pleasant , inconsequential gag and No. 2 ( The Alien Corn ) a piece of out &; out bathos . But script No. 3 is a solid bite of meatiest Maugham . The Kite is the story of Herbert Sunbury ( George Cole ) , a simple-minded city lad with a possessive mom ( Hermione Baddeley ) and a small boy 's passion for flying kites on the local commons . But Herbert 's young bride wants him with no kite strings-nor silver cords-attached . When he refuses to cut loose , she kicks him out and plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " mourns Herbert . Back at Mom 's he vengefully refuses to pay his wife 's allotment , prefers instead to do an occasional stint in jail . <P> Out of this twist on an old theme , Producer Sydney Box ( The Seventh Veil ) and Director Arthur Crabtree have built a wryly humorous study of lower-middle-class life in a London suburb . The camera moves with a sharp , knowing eye from the vulgar pretensions of tea in the Sunbury parlor to Herbert 's wonderful kite straining and swooping in a fine summer breeze . Though Herbert and his wife are happily reconciled ( over a kite string on the commons ) , the movie never compromises with the silver cord . As Herbert 's mom , Hermione Baddeley gives a viciously distinguished performance . <P> Quartet ends with The Colonel 's Lady , an exhilarating snifter of Maugham 's best vintage . It describes the troubles of a Blimpish colonel and his mousy , neglected wife whose little volume of passionate love poems suddenly becomes a nationwide bestseller . Cecil Parker and Nora Swinburne are just right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling , acidulous comments on club-chair Berties and Mayfair literati . <P> The Fighting O'Flynn ( Fairbanks ; Universal-International ) allows Douglas Fairbanks Jr . to make good use of a reliable family formula : never enter a room through a door if you can vault through the window , never pick a fight with one man if you can take on a squad . In a cheerfully outrageous tale of a Napoleonic plot to invade Ireland , Fairbanks makes his entrance with tongue in cheek . In the end , he almost swallows it to keep from laughing at his own exaggerated heroics . <P> None of the cast bothers to play it straight . Apparently happiest in his spoofing is Irish Actor Arthur Shields , who slyly caricatures the screen mannerisms of his more famous brother , Barry Fitzgerald ( whose real name is William Shields ) . <P> The Fighting O'Flynn is a barefaced whopper , unsullied by any hint of realism , but it is told with whopping good spirits . <P> Whispering Smith* ( Paramount ) is a standard horse opera , in Technicolor , full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion of a clean-cut Ladd ( Alan ) for a Good Woman ( Brenda Marshall ) . The complicating fact is that Brenda is married to Alan 's old friend ( Robert Preston ) . But Preston develops a taste for too much liquor , too many women and two evil companions ( Donald Crisp and Frank Faylen ) .
