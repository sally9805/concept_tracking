txt President Truman proposed to Congress I today a national defense budget for the 1950 fiscal year of nearly $15 , - ' 900,000,000 , greatest in peacetime history but considerably less than the total sought by the three ' armed forces . The President 's estimate differed from that of the National Military Establishment , which put the figure at about $14,700,000,000 . The latter total omitted $800,000,000 proposed by Mr. Truman for Universal Military Training as well as a $279,000,000 item for higher shipbuilding costs . A breakdown of the President 's $15,900,000,000 budget was in rounded sums as follows : Army $4,500,000,000 ; Air Force , $4,600,000,000 ; Navy , $4,600,006 , - 000 ; contingent funds , $830,000,000 ; the training program , $800,000,000 and stockpiling , $525,000,000 . Funds , including appropriations and new contract authority , for the three armed forces in this fiscal year were as follows : Army , $4,224,000,000 ; Navy , $5,095,000 , - 000 and Air Force , $4,713,000,000 . Those figures covered pay of personnel , maintenance and support , procurement and production , research and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-military expenses . In addition to these sums for each of the armed forces were funds , appropriated or authorized , for stockpiling , contingent reserves and other miscellaneous items , which brought the total for the 949 fiscal year to about $14:700 , -1 ' 0,000 . Mr. Truman told Congress that /.5 budget would be adequate foil a defense program showing the " proper relationship " between the country 's security and the national economy . At the same time , it curbed the hopes and cut back the plans , especially of the Air Force , that were projected last year , somewhat against the President 's wishes . Mr. Truman said that his recommendations were ro , ' based on a plan for a national defense position of relative military readiness , coupled with a higher degree of mobilization preparedness . " " This type of military planning , " he added , " will permit us continuously to revise our tactics and develop our weapons to meet modern conditions , but is clearly consistent with our traditional concept of military strength for purposes of defense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services , psychologically as well as materially , was the Air Force . Its fifty-nine air groups , in addition to a " provisional " group on the Berlin airlift , would be reduced to forty-eight combat groups and ten squadrons . Personnel on full-time active duty would be increased from the 411,000 officers and men on Dec. 1 , 1948 , to an average of 412,000 for 1950 . Earlier plans called for a total b ; July 1 , 1949 , of 444,500 officers and men , not including 15,000 of 18-year-old youths . Defense officials said that the cut in the air groups was less than it appeared . The new groups , though fewer in number , the spokesmen asserted , would be stronger individually and collectively , as a result of a new grouping system and newer planes . They pointed also to Mr. Truman 's statement that the 1950 program " gives priority to air power and to strengthening the civilian reserve components . " The Air Force , nevertheless , was pulled up sharply by the President 's recommendations , and this is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday , W. Stuart Symington , Secretary of the Air Force , strongly urged more air power and set his goal as seventy groups by 1952 . He has many friends in Congress ; his program has a wide popular appeal , and there are signs that the seventy-group force will get heavy support on Capitol Hill . The Army also received a setback . The President proposed a land force of 677,000 officers and men on active duty for 1950 . Plans approved last year envisaged 900 , - 000 by July 1 , 1949 . The impact of Mr. Truman 's budget has already been felt on the Army , especially on the Selective Service System . On Nov. 30 , the Army cut its draft call for January from 20,000 to 10,000 meri , and announced a February call of only 5,000 . On Saturday , the Army cancelled that 5,000 . In terms of personnel , the Navy also took its turn on the President 's " economy " wheel .. Instead of a total force , including Marine Corps , of 609,900 officers and men by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under his recommendation , 527,000 in 1950 . This is a reduction of ' 4,000 from its active force on last Dec. 1 . On the other hand , the President estimated expenditures for naval ship construction at $406,000,000 for the 1950 fiscal year , or about $100,000,000 more than for 1949 . Included in his figure were the probable , outlays for several conversions and modifications of vessels , as well as for construction of a " super aircraft carrier , costing an estimated $124,000,000 , which is scheduled to be completed in 1952 . None of the reductions in the three services ' proposals , however , are reflected in Mr. Truman 's program for the reserves and the socalled civilian components of the armed forces . His recommendation in this area is supported by his view of the form and function of military preparedness . " Our concept of national defense , " he said , " places important reliance upon the readiness of citizen-soldiers . This budget provides for larger and better-trained reserves for the Air Force , Army and Navy . " " Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should plan our military structure at this time so as to insure a balanced military program in the foreseeable future at approximately the level recommended in this budget . " At the same time , we must recognize that preparations for defense must be flexible , and not ' rigid . They must reflect changes in the international situation , ' changes in technology and in the economic situation . We must be in a position to alter our military programs as circumstances change . " There were two important implications seen in the President 's budget . One is the victory of Mr. Truman over the combined forces of the defense establishment and the supremacy of civilians over the Imilitary authorities in the Administration , The second implication , observers believed , is of even greater immediate significance . This is that the President and his advisers have found that the world situation is less explosive today - than it was last year , or at least less than some of the spokesmen for the armed forces were saying it was last year . This inference is supported , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense budget be kept at the present level in future years , barring any sudden change on the international scene . A focal point in the fiscal struggle between the President 's Budget Bureau and the armed forces was the $15,000,000,000 limit put on the defense budget by Mr. Truman in July . In the intervening months he stood by his commitment , convinced , according to associates , that the world situation did not merit a greater outlay . It was a debatable question , even after an examination of the President 's charts ( set down by the Budget Bureau ) and the tabulations of the National Military Establishment , whether Mr. Truman broke through his ceiling . By the bureau 's figuring , the cost of the national defense program for the next fiscal year would come to nearly $15,900,000,000 , or greater than his limit . Of this total , Mr. Truman said , $13,200. - 000,000 would be requested in cash appropriations and $2,700,000,000 in authority for future contracts . The National Military Establishment added its budget up to slightly more than $14,700,000,000 , or about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was a " question " as to whether the $279,000,000 for higher shipbuilding costs should be charged to the present or the next fiscal year , and , also , whether the $800,000,000 for Universal Military Training sould be included in so far as Congress has not approved it .
