Washington last week reproved an old gambler 's axiom : the best way to make money is to play with other people 's chips . While U.S. airlines did their biggest job in history , it was the airmail division of the Post Office which collected over half the ante . The division 's reported profit for fiscal 1942 , after deduction of its own direct expenses , was a record $8 million-more than half the total net earnings of all 18 U.S. domestic airlines . Next year the division will probably earn a cool $22 million or perhaps better , thanks mostly to an ace in the hole : Though it will slash rates paid to the airlines , it will probably maintain the present 6 airmail letter rate to U.S. citizens .
