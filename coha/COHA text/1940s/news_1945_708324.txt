txt Plowing head-on into the German army 's most powerful battle positions , American troops of the 1st army have smashed their way forward in the . last two days In the most appalling conditions ever seen on the western front . Every inch of ground being . won by these doughboys on Field Marshal von Rundstedt 's northern flank is being won on sheer guts and not on grand strategy . The doughboys ' and tanks advanced thru a snow and sleet storm which turned the fighting in these mountains and forests into a white hell . The Germane-are making each town and hill a strorigpoint , and exact the maximum price for its capture before falling back . The price to Americans at times has been high ? quite high . Churned Alleys of Ice . Alloverahe mountains and woods wet ' The roads Were churned alleys of Ice , snow and mUd.f.t.Trucks ; k:tanks  --  a d guns slid around like giraffes on roller skates . This division moved secretly in a night ' march to hit the Germans . It was one , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinning down icy hills in circles , snapping telephone poles like blades of grass , thereby . cutting communications . Big guns slithered off the road into ' gulleys. - The slightest hill made the ' steel treads of tanks churn helplessly . The , division reached the ? ump.Off Point just , in time to ' eat a cold breakfast and start moving . again . It has been like that ever since the offensive started , only now the Germans are adding their own hazards to the weather in the shape of heavy artillery barrages and mortar fire . Using More Artillery : " The Germans are using more Artillery than we have seen before , " said Lt. Col. Russell W. Jenne. of Macomb , Ill . " We ca n't get a Cub plane ; off the ground and there is no chance for counter battery fire . Our troops just have to take it . " " This snow and sleet does queer things , " Clark added . " Some of our GI 's at first claimed the Germans Were using some'sort of new silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadening sound . " The German policy has been to hold ' some strategic ground and then hide anti-tank guns In the woods around a town , protecting its approaches and then put up a furious battle for it . The anti-tank guns ca n't be seen by the tanks because of the heavy snowfall , but the German gunners can see the tanks moving and cut loose , knocking them out . Halted without a Shot . Once pushed out of a town , the Germans plaster it with artillery . An attack in one sector was halted simply because our tanks could not get up an icy hill , altho not a shot was being fired . ' Doughboys are protecting the tanks after dark by digging shallow foxholes and sitting and shivering in them thruout the ' night . " There is nothing else the men can do except just take it and sleep In the snow , " said an officer . The only man not concerned with the weather on this front today was Pvt . Donald Marsh of Racine , Wis. , member of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit and was running around happily- in the slush while the rest of his soaked and frozen companions ' looked on enviously .
