txt An American tank operated by a Russian crew on the Eastern Front is a more deadly weapon against the Nazis than one lying idle in this country . That is such a self-evident fact that it should hardly be necessary for President Roosevelt to point it out in his thirteenth report to Congress on the operation of the Lend-Lease Act . Yet there are still some who still look at this device for mobilizing the resources of the United Nations as a kind of onesided proposition by which we are making our allies richer and impoverishing ourselves . The President reports that the total cash value of the goods we have shipped under Lend-Lease to our allies and friends from March , 1941 , to the end of November , 1943 , was $18,355 , - 820,000 . More than $10,000,000,000 worth was shipped in the first eleven months of last year . These are tremendous figures , yet the President notes that the total of Lend-Lease aid constitutes only 13.5 of all United States war expenditures for the period . In his report the President at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid , " and indeed it will seem to many that the term is more descriptive of the law , now that we are at war , than the title of the act which was passed during the period of our neutrality .

In Britain and Australia especially Lend-Lease has been operating two ways with a tremendous saving to us in many ways , not the least of which is shipping . As the President says : " Whether food and war supplies should be transferred by one United Nation to another , or retained for its own forces , depends on the strategic military necessities of the war .

It is a small thing compared to the great issues involved , but it is the sort of pinprick that Dr. Goebbels knows how to exploit in order to sow dissatisfaction and disunity on the home front . But the President reports that not an ounce of butter has gone to any country except Russia , which received a total of 8,500 tons in 1942 and 25,000 tons in 1943 , mostly for convalescent soldiers . According to the President 's data , all the butter shipped to Russia in that whole period amounted to oneseventh of an ounce per week from the plate of each civilian in the United States . At the same time , as an example of how Lend-Lease works in reverse , the President notes that our troops in the Pacific have received 8,250 tons of Australian and New Zealand butter which otherwise would have had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
