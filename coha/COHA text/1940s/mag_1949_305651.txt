Sir Anthony Van Dyck was one of the best art students that ever lived , and the special pet of Antwerp 's great painter Peter Paul Rubens . In Antwerp 's Koninklijk Museum last week , painters and art lovers were learning from Student Van Dyck . The exhibition , in celebration of the 350th anniversary of his birth , contained 134 paintings , sketches and etchings , showed both the strengths and weaknesses of imitative , academic genius . <P> The seventh child of a rich silk merchant , Van Dyck was an artist at 16 , with his own studio and students . He did fine , for Antwerp rattled with commerce and bulged with gold ; and its beefy , bearded burghers all wanted portraits of themselves and their wives . But the aristocratic little portraitist was far from satisfied with his own work . At 19 he got admittance to the artists ' Guild of Saint Luke , and at 20 went back to school , at Rubens ' feet . <P> Purity &; Flavor . The master had turned his palace into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Rubens would supply them with sketches , add a few finishing touches when the paintings were done , and sign them with a flourish . He soon found that young Van Dyck 's work needed no finishing touches . Experts have since despaired of telling some of their portraits apart . The student 's are as bold and right as the master 's own , with the same purity and flavor , and only a little less body-for with all his talents , Van Dyck lacked Rubens ' typically Flemish delight in pink-and-white flesh . <P> When he had learned all that Rubens could teach him , Van Dyck made a trip to London , where he was ignored , and then circled down to Italy , where he found new old masters whose work taught him as much as Rubens ' had : Titian and Veronese . Their paintings strengthened his like a blood transfusion , flooding his pictures with dark , rich colors and dignifying their shadowed backgrounds with glimpses of formal gardens , pillars and balustrades .

But his manners as well as his brush charmed the <P> Genoese nobility , and in five years in Genoa he painted half the cavaliers and haughty ladies of the houses of Doria , Brignole Sale , Pallavicini , Balbi , Cattaneo , Spinola , Lommelini and Grimaldi . <P> Pride &; Pallor . On his second trip to London Van Dyck became king 's pet . He was taken up by Charles I ( who was something of a connoisseur ) , knighted , and persuaded to stay . The Crown gave him a summer residence at Eltham Palace and he spent his winters in Blackfriars . He painted 36 known portraits of the king , 25 of Queen Henrietta Maria . The British nobility followed the king to Van Dyck 's studio , and suiting his art to his sitters , he forsook the rich palette of his Italian period to paint them in proud , pale , silver-grey tones .
