Regular Army and Air Force officers , who put efficiency above politics , have long hoped that some day the National Guard would be truly federalized . Last week they got a surprise . <P> A six-man interservice committee , under the chairmanship of the Army 's Assistant Secretary Gordon Gray , recommended that the air and ground forces of the state-controlled National Guard be merged with the federally controlled Organized Reserve Corps into a single , federal reserve arm for each service . In place of the guard , each state would raise its own militia unit , as it did in wartime . <P> There was sound military reasoning behind the committee 's recommendations . Organized under 51 separate state and territorial commands ( though supported chiefly by federal funds ) , guard units have often suffered from spotty training ; their top officers have often been kept on the job for political reasons . Even after the guard was called to federal service in 1940 , it took nearly two years to get some units ready for combat . Next time , warned the Gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Oldtime National Guard officers would have none of such heresy . State control of the guard , cried the National Guard Association 's 60-year-old Major General Ellard A. Walsh , " is practically the last bastion in the fortress of states ' rights . " He warned that the politically powerful association would carry the fight to Congress . <P> The protest was hardly necessary . The White House was aware of the report 's explosive political contents . It had temporarily withdrawn the report after issuing it a fortnight ago . Last week Defense Secretary Forrestal dryly pointed out that the report was not " a pattern for legislative action . . . and does not , at this stage , constitute military establishment policy .
