REMEMBER last winter ? Remember when oil sold for 31 cents a gallon , when landlords were fined for failing to supply heat to tenants , when ships were tied up for lack of fuel , when oil and gasoline exports were canceled in spite of foreign needs , when schools closed in the great city of New York in order to save oil ? Now we are in for all that again , and bans on exports , loans of oil from the navy , hints on how to use less oil , and optimistic statements from the chiefs of the oil industry are not going to help much . How did we get this way , when our economy has been geared to oil for so many years ? Petroleum supplies 48 per cent of all America 's energy , and each year becomes more important . In the winter of 1947 , when 750,000 new oil burners were installed in American homes , the per capita consumption was 580 gallons , 118 gallons more than in 1941 . In 1948 the figure has risen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Increased demand is of course one cause of the shortage , but it is not the only one . While the oil industry was encouraging all and sundry to instal oil-heating equipment , two Secretaries of the Interior and almost every competent geologist issued warnings that the easy-money oil fields were running out . Aside from the tidelands and the continental shelf no new great fields are in sight anywhere in the forty-eight states . We have one as yet unexploited field at Point Barrow , Alaska  --  held under wraps of secrecy by the United States navy  --  but it would be extremely difficult to open this field to commercial exploitation even if that were desirable . All freight for Alaska must pass through the bottleneck of a closely held Seattle shipping monopoly . Even were ships available , port facilities at Seward and Anchorage , the gateways to the interior , are woefully inadequate , and Point Barrow itself is ice-bound for all but a few weeks of the year . The only answer is a pipe line , and pipe lines are kept pipe dreams by a steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its muscle-bound condition . Little hope in Alaska . Or in the Caribbean . Latin American oil fields are almost all fully exploited . The oil interests contend that any shortage that may exist can be overcome if they are permitted to develop , with government help , the oil of the Middle East . There lie the greatest remaining reservoirs  --  proved resources of about thirty-five billion barrels as against America 's twenty-two billion barrels . All the strategy of our oil kings is directed toward winning that prize . Control of Middle Eastern oil , moreover , can bring them not only fabulous wealth but domination of the economy of all Western Europe . The E. C. A. countries produce only about 4 per cent of their oil requirements . When our government curtailed oil shipments to Europe last January by 181/2 per cent , owing to the shortage in this country , factories abroad were shut down and transportation was stalled . While little is said in the press about this aspect of the oil problem , plenty is thought about it in government offices in Paris and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1948 The oil companies and their legislative henchmen saw their opportunity in the necessity for curtailing our exports of oil . " Let us , " they shouted , " stop all shipments of oil to Europe from this country and send oil from American-owned properties in the Middle East . " They got what they wanted . Under the European Recovery Plan 80 per cent of Europe 's oil needs will be supplied from the Middle Eastern fields by 1951 . ? On the heels of the government decision Standard Oil of New Jersey issued an illuminating statement . " We recognize , " it said , " that international trade considerations involve political considerations of the highest order . " No one understands such considerations better than the oil companies . It is political considerations which have given them the Middle East . On the other hand , these very considerations have been a potent factor in creating friction with Russia . The Soviet Unkin does not relish American control of Europe 's principal source of oil , and hence of its whole economy . If war broke out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle Eastern deposits are of such a nature that one bomb on one well might drain a whole field . Moreover , no objective expert , inside or outside the United States , believes it would be possible for us to hang on to the fields for more than a few weeks after war was declared . Russia , from its contiguous territory , could quickly destroy the wells by bombing or overrun them with ground forces . o lEtTIOUSLY neither this country nor Europe can look to the oil men and their political henchmen to change the situation . The oil men like the shortage . It gives them not only the rich profits that result from soaring prices but the strongest voice of any industrial bloc in state , national , and world politics . L. E. Ulrope , manager of direct marketing for the great Esso unit of Standard Oil , indicated the only fly in the ointment to a group of oil men meeting recently in New York City . Describing a survey made on the Eastern seaboard by his company , he said that 32 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opinion that the oil companies were somehow to blame for the shortage , and 38 per cent thought that some sort of government control or supervision would improve conditions . Ulrope and other speakers urged the audience , therefore , to join an industry-wide drive to combat the desire for nationalization which they detected in these statistics . In my view the oil industry is over-sensitive . I have yet to hear the word nationalization even whispered in connection with the oil companies by any group which has influence in this country . Nationalization would not create underground oil , though it would exploit the tidelands and the continental shelf , now being boycotted by the oil men , and * See Oil Profits and the E. R. P. , by Sydney J. Neal , in The Nation for December 4.697 might produce substitutes faster than an oil industry which has long admittedly underestimated demand . Hope of overcoming the oil shortage depends not so much on who owns the fields as on what is done with them and how the oil is used . A modern solution requires , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be developed as rapidly as possible . The great tidelands deposits still lie untouched . They will provide us with no oil as long as the companies think that by sitdown strikes , dickers with Cabinet officials , and the financing of states ' rights political blocs they can finally get them as a present from the nation . Another potentially great source is the continental shelf , declared to be federal property by President Franklin D. Roosevelt so that the oil thought to be there might be safeguarded for the people . Former Secretary of the Interior Ickes says he was told by a high oil executive that on the California shelf alone " more oil will be found than has been discovered to date on the continent itself . " This would be a heartening prospect if the oil companies were not resolved that none of the oil shall be taken out until they have gained control of the whole underwater area . L ARGE as the reserves of off-shore oil are estimated to be , the spiraling demand will find them inadequate . Industrialization of backward countries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is necessary to supply the world with food are increasing consumption in geometric progression . At the same time the knowledge is beginning to dawn on us that oil has become too valuable to burn . Crude oil has other uses than to create heat or lubrication . It is at present one of the most valuable raw materials for a great chemical industry . Among the myriad products already being made from it are plastics , insecticides , fertilizers , and antiseptics . Yet according to the New York Times , 50 per cent of the total production of crude oil is used for heating . Another 40 per cent goes into gasoline . Obviously , efforts to conserve our oil resources must be applied chiefly in these fields . Fortunately , liquid fuel can be obtained from other sources , for instance , from coal . And since the United States coal reserves are estimated to be ample for all demands for the next three thousand years , we can draw 698 The NATION lavishly on them . Handled as a solid , coal is expensive to transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are removed when coal is liquefied . As far back as 1933 the Germans in the Ruhr manufactured synthetic oil from coal on a commercial basis . If we diverted half of our known coal reserve to the making of gasoline , we should have sufficient  --  on the basis of 1947 's consumption  --  for four thousand years . The Bureau of Mines has a plant at Louisiana , Missouri , which will shortly be producing 200 barrels of gasoline a day from coal . The cost will be about 14 cents a gallon for aviation gasoline . Thus if the oil companies continue to boost the price of their natural product , synthetic gas will soon be competitive . And the 14-cent figure is certain to come down as mass-production methods are evolved . Pulverized coal and coal in the ground have also been used at Morgantown , West Virginia , to achieve cheap production of the carbon monoxide and hydrogen which are used in the manufacture of synthetic fuel . Burning coal in the vein before it is mined  --  gasification  --  is one of the most intriguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mines in collaboration with a privately owned company has already demonstrated by actual test in a Southern mine that combustion can be maintained in unmined coal and the coal completely consumed and gasified . The processes are beyond the blueprint stage . In a careful , realistic statement the Bureau of Mines says : " If the operation can be conducted with oxygen , and under pressure , very high temperatures ; and a suitable ynthesis , gas should be obtained . Many problems remain to be solved , however . " The g a s produced can be used for generating power , f o r chemical purposes , or for heating . Underground gasi-fication on a wide scale will work a revolution in great sectors of our economy . It will virtually end the dangerous and exhausting labor of the coal miner . The steel that now goes into freight cars , rails , shovels , cranes , bins , and all the other appurtenances of handling coal will be saved : simple pipe lines will carry the gas to power plants , homes , and factories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crisis in oil  --  and in steel  --  one would expect research in coal gasificati ma to have enlisted the interest of all the major gas , coal , and oil interests . Actually such progress as has been recorded is almost entirely the single-handed achievement of one small department of government , the Bureau of Mines , operating with 200 scientists on a $30,000,000 program of research . T HE conversion of natural gas into synthetic liquid fuel is in a less experimental stage . One of the many Standard Oil giants has a plant at Baton Rouge already in operation and with the completion of others in Kansas and Texas is expected to produce 400,000 barrels of oil a year . Of course , natural gas does not need to be converted into liquid fuel to be excellent for heating purposes . Edwin Falck , chief consultant on power and utilities for the National Security Resources Board , has urged that it be piped into the large Eastern consuming areas as a means of conserving fuel oil . Mr. Falck is not the first to see this necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests have combined their efforts with those of John L. Lewis to keep the competition of natural gas out of their best markets . Oil-bearing shale rock can also be made to yield liquid fuel . At Rifle , Colorado , the Bureau of Mines has proved beds of shale five hundred feet thick which contain an average of fifteen gallons to the ton . A pilot plant there is producing gasoline at a cost of 5 to 6 cents a gallon , about the same as for gasoline from oil . The quality , however , is inferior . The sun is of course the most ancient source of heat . But the principle of solar heating is being applied for the first time on a large scale in the new factory of the Gruen Watch Company in Cincinnati . Ten months in the year this building will be heated by the sun all through the day . A woman scientist working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has also devised a way to use the sun to heat her new house near Boston . As she described it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Science , the house is heated by a " sun-trap , " which represents $3,000 of the $20,000 the house cost . The trap is constructed on the roof , and the heat is stored in tanks filled with chemicals . Successful , low-cost use of solar heat could greatly modify the necessity of conserving other fuels . There is finally the prospect of utilizing atomic energy for heating and power . If this seems far away now , consider how fast developments in this field have already proceeded . It is good to know of these various possibilities for the future , but none of them will help us this winter when the oil tanks go dry . Cold houses , idle cars , laid-off workers , increased friction with Russia , all will be due to the machinations of an industry more given to getting its oil through politics than through research . Conservation of resources and the development of new fuels are modern requirements directly opposed to the destructive techniques and set ideas of the old-fashioned oil barons .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
