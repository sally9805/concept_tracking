It is a big day in Pearl Harbor when a black submarine slides in past the green flatlands , past Ford Island and the gaunt wreckage of the Oklahoma and warps into a slip at the Submarine Base . On her conning tower is painted the score of her cruise : a column of rising suns . A Navy band tootles a greeting . Lashed to her periscope is a broom , symbol of a clean sweep in enemy waters . <P> Ask a battleship or destroyer man where he has been operating and the answer is the Aleutians or the South Pacific , as the case may be ; ask a submariner ( pronounced submariner in the service ) and the casual answer is : " The Empire . " The Empire is Japan . Outside of the crews of some B-25s , who did not linger , no other U.S. fighting men have ventured into that area . The submariner regards it as his routine theater of operations . <P> The black ship is in Pearl Harbor for censored days . One day she is moored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fruit brought aboard at the moment of her arrival , her crew sprawled around reading mail from home- " sugar reports " - which is priority business . Then she is off again for the Empire . <P> Details of operation are the darkest of secrets . During that censored number of days when she lies in Pearl Harbor being prepared for her next excursion , yarns are spun at the officers ' club ashore and at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel , where submariners are quartered between patrols . But few stories leak out to the newspapers . In no other realm of naval warfare is stealth so important , secrecy so vital . Only gradually has the Navy released the names of some of the skippers , the quietly tough young men who run the lean black ships in the tradition of John Paul Jones . <P> How well and audaciously the U.S. submarine fleet has operated was attested to this week when the Navy announced the sinking , by submarines , of seven more Jap ships making the score for U.S. subs : 346 Jap ships sunk , 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 77% of the total enemy shipping sunk or damaged in the Pacific . <P> The Buccaneers . Skipper of the Flying Fish is slim , quiet Commander Glynn Robert Donaho of Normangee , Tex . He remembers when the Flying Fish ran into an enemy task force close to shore . He scored hits on one ship and was taking a setup on a second when an aircraft bomb dropped close aboard . Things got so hot afterwards that one of the crew broke out all the candy in the stores , declaring , " We might as well eat it up now , we may never have another chance . " But the Flying Fish survived , sank or damaged 100,000 tons of enemy shipping in five patrols . <P> There is soft-spoken Burt Klakring , the man who watched a horse race on the Japanese seacoast through his periscope . He is also known in the Navy as an expert pianist , was described in the Lucky Bag the year he was graduated from Annapolis as " super-sentimental . " On a single patrol , mild-mannered , sentimental Commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swashbuckling Creed ( " Burly " ) Burlingame , whose favorite procedure is to close with a Jap ship on the surface , damning her fire and sinking her with his deck gun . There is Roy Davenport , Burlingame 's onetime executive officer , who prays devoutly , prowling beneath Jap waters with the firm belief that his torpedoes carry the benison of heaven .
