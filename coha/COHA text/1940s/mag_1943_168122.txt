Hitler 's New Order was put to the vote in occupied Denmark last week . For reasons best known to themselves , the Germans permitted the Danes to hold parliamentary elections . The result was the biggest vote in Danish history and a smashing rebuke to the Nazi overlords-a boomerang to the Germans , who , also for reasons of their own , had taken care to advertise the elections to the world . <P> Public electioneering by press and radio , distribution of posters and leaflets were banned . But the issue was clearly drawn . " Say No to Germany " was the BBC-borne advice from Free Danish leaders in London . The Germans presumably thought the elections would be good propaganda for their New Order , which is supposed to give non-Germans a better break than they have had up to now in Europe . Perhaps , too , they even hoped to boost the prestige of Danish Nazi leader Fritz Clausen . On the second count , at least , they were dismally wrong . <P> Altogether the six anti-Nazi parties obtained 1,941,600 votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and increased their seats in the powerless Rigsdag lower house from 137 to 143 . The Germans deliberately kept the German minority ( Schleswig ) party out of the campaign , and the Danish pro-Nazi elements lost three of eight seats . Instead of praise for Germany 's benign treatment , Dr. Goebbels reaped humiliating acclaim for Denmark 's adherence to the democratic ideal . <P> Numerically the Social Democrats ( Labor party ) registered the greatest gain , getting 894,650 votes , an increase of 23% since 1939 . But the vote was also a great tribute to the Conservative Party 's leader , lion-maned John Christmas Moeller , who made a dramatic escape to England several months ago . His party 's 421,050 votes represented the greatest proportionate advance , with a rise of 40% . Commented Mr. Moeller : " I have always said that only 3% of the Danish populations are pro-German.
