Last November acid-tongued Columnist Westbrook Pegler dug up evidence in Chicago that in 1922 William Bioff had been convicted of pandering , sentenced to six months in jail , released after serving just eight days ( TIME , Aug. 21 , Dec. 4 ) . This was news because Bioff is western representative and reputed boss of the potent International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employes ( Stagehands ' Union ) . <P> Pegler turned his evidence over to State 's Attorney Thomas James Courtney . Attorney Courtney promptly wired a warrant to Los Angeles , where William Bioff was watching over the union problems of Hollywood 's cinema technicians , and Bioff was arrested .

There is something decidedly rotten when this sort of thing continues indefinitely . . . . The public . . . is beginning to understand what this rotten thing is : THE BRAZENLY ACKNOWLEDGED ALLIANCE BETWEEN CRIMINALS AND CORRUPT POLITICIANS ! " <P> Last week , because of this editorial , Colonel Knox and the Daily News were defendants in a $250,000 libel suit . Democratic Governor Horner accused Republican Colonel Knox of : 1 ) implying that Bioff 's extradition had been postponed for improper reasons ; 2 ) misrepresenting facts ; 3 ) trying to " impair and destroy the influence and power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Governor called attention to the fact that Publisher Knox was Republican nominee for Vice President of the United States in 1936 .
