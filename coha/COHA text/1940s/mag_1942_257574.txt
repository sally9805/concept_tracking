When the R.A.F. blitzed Lubeck last April , they destroyed a literary landmark , the ancestral home of emigre Novelist Thomas Mann . The Mann mansion was an 18th-Century rococo building popularly known as the Buddenbrookshaus after Mann 's two-volume first novel , Buddenbrooks-a genealogical account of the rise &; fall of a middle-class German family engaged in the Lubeck grain &; feed trade . <P> Novelist Mann , now comfortably housed in the California bungalow he built last year in suburban Los Angeles , took the destruction of Buddenbrookshaus philosophically .
