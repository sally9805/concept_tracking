The WPB offices seethed and simmered . Down the halls went whispers of revolt and counter-revolt . WPB was in the midst of a palace revolution-which would either save the day or hasten the failure . <P> Back to the grinding struggle , after a week 's rest in the Adirondacks , went Donald Nelson , the patient , plodding ex-Sears , Roebuck vice president now under fire for failing to be Production Boss in fact as well as in title . He had gone away dog-tired , his nerves deckle-edged , and almost willing to give in and give up . Now the weary wrinkles had left his brown eyes ; the sag was gone from his padded cheeks ; he was as fighting mad as a peaceable man can get . His friends in WPB passed word around : a new Nelson had returned for a fight to the finish . <P> He got his chance to fight sooner than he expected . On the second day that he walked into his office he landed smack in the middle of one of the senseless , directionless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start . <P> A front-page story in that morning 's Washington Post bore a shocking headline : INEFFICIENCY , WASTE LAID TO WPB 's IRON , STEEL BRANCH . Said the Post scoop : a young , $5,600-a-year WPB consultant named Frederick I. Libbey was cooking up a report which would blister the WPB 's Iron &; Steel Branch ; after consultation around the country with steel experts he had found gross mismanagement in Washington ; he was convinced the steel branch experts were second-rate ex-salesmen palmed off on the Government by steel companies who do n't need salesmen any more . Only a major shake-up could save the day , said the Libbey story . <P> No responsible WPB official had seen the Libbey report ; but it had " leaked " to the Post . There was doubtless some truth in it . No one has yet made a satisfactory explanation why the U.S. , with half the world 's steel capacity , is bogged in a steel " shortage . " But the cure was not in intramural bickering in WPB 's big undisciplined mob . A more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by big ( 6 ft. 3 ) hustling Reese Taylor , steel division chief : he wants a quota plan patterned after Bernard Baruch 's World War I steel controls ( TIME , Aug. 24 ) . <P> WPB 's iron &; steel men took one look at the Post story , blew up . In groups and singly , dozens walked in to Reese Taylor and tossed resignations on his desk . They were in revolt . Taylor could not answer their angry argument that discipline was impossible if any WPB hireling could publicly indict everybody else . Taylor , too , was sore . He stomped off to Nelson . <P> Taylor got quick action from the boss . Nelson at once disowned the report , ordered Libbey fired for talking out of turn , gathered the whole steel branch around him to promise no more monkeyshines . Never before had Nelson moved so quickly . <P> The C.I.O. members of WPB 's labor advisory committee promptly staged a counter-revolt , charging that their friend Libbey was fired " for telling the truth , " that " vested interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were " given aid and comfort by certain dollar-a-year men . " But everyone else , including Frederick Libbey , seemed pleased . Said he , as he started to look for a new job :
