txt Judged by its magnificent performance in erasing league by league the gains made by the Germans in their Summer campaign , the Red Army seems stronger instead of weaker than it was last Winter . The momentum of the drive increases rather than diminishes as the days go by . The spectacular advance in the Caucasus follows the big push in the north , and the dash , energy and tactical resourcefulness with which the Soviet forces pounce on one weak spot after another indicate more than good generalship and unflagging spirit . It is an impressive demonstration of great reserves of manpower and amazing capacity to replace equipment despite the loss of industrial plants . When the Germans , at the end of the two mightiest assaults the Wehrmacht has ever delivered , admit that the Russians are now superior in air power , they testify that they are up against an inexhaustible and unbeatable force . The display of Russian might will dispose some observers to question whether the need for the second front was as desperate as it appeared a few months ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own front without help from anybody except in the way of supplies , now reaching their armies in increasing quantities . But equally there can be no doubt that the diversion in North Africa is a decisive factor in their present success . The Tunisian war becomes a major campaign , to he won only by an enormous concentration of strength and effort on our side , because Hitler has been obliged to mass air force , transport and troops to maintain a foothold in Africa . In addition , he is building a deep line of fortifications to make the Mediterranean coast of France as hard to breach by the Allied forces as the northern coast , and planting artillery and air bases from Sardinia to Sicily . To defend his " fortress " against the new threat from Africa , he has had to weaken his forces in Russia . If he can not hold his key positions in the east , the famous " hedgehogs " like Velikiye Luki and Rzhev and Rostov as strongly as he clung to them under the incomparably worse weather conditions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another front to fortify and protect . And that only emphasizes the central point in all the arguments . The vital question is not whether Russia needed a second front or not . It is too obvious to require reiteration that the success of the struggle in which we are all engaged demands as many assaults on Hitler 's positions as can possibly be launched . This is not a Russian or an AngloAmerican war ; it is the war of a great coalition of nations formed for the purpose of defeating a conspiracy for world domination , and in this war the Russians are helping the troops in Africa and the Allied armies in the desert are helping the armies on the Don . As time passes and their strength accumulates , these fighters in the west will draw more German forces from the east as effectively as if they were battling side by side with the Russia It is , in short , always and everywh the same fight ; and the more cc pletely the common stake is emp : sized , the more hope there is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
