Two little Central American countries , El Salvador and Guatemala , struggled in freedom 's toils last week . Both had recently overthrown tyrants . Both had discovered that the seeds of tyranny did not vanish with the tyrants . <P> Loyal Soldier . General Andrs Ignacio Menndez , Provisional President of El Salvador , was doing pretty well . Appointed by the tottering Dictator , Maximiliano Hernndez Martinez , Menndez might have made himself Dictator too . Instead he announced that he would hold the Government in trust for an elected president . <P> The Army sulked . Its 26 colonels and generals , accustomed to power , feared that a civilian government would reduce their privileges . When they threatened a military coup Menndez called them to the palace , cowed them with some tough talk . <P> The people of San Salvador paraded , hailed Menndez as their " loyal soldier . " This crisis surmounted , El Salvador 's prospects improved . The old Dictator 's reign of terror had vanished . The press was free and vigorous But El Salvador 's democrats still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the people are unused to governing themselves . <P> So that the people might have a little time to learn , the presidential elections were scheduled for next January .

Tall , good-looking , 33-year-old Dr. Romero is a gentle idealist who nevertheless makes sense . If he wins the presidency , he can thank General Menndez , the " loyal soldier . " <P> Unsmiling General . When Guatemala 's hated Dictator Jorge Ubico resigned the presidency , he delegated power to a junta of three generals . The leader , hard and unsmiling Federico Ponce , promptly convoked Ubico 's hand-picked Congress , over awed it by stationing troops at the doors . Obediently , the deputies elected him Provisional President . Five young lawyers who protested were slapped into jail . Ponce 's government won astonishingly prompt U.S. approval . <P> Ponce acted as though he were keeping the government in trust for Ubico and fired very few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not flee to Mexico , as first reported , but simply retired to a private house on the capital 's Fourteenth St. <P> All the same , Guatemala tingled with excitement . The fear-struck silence was gone . The press was free . Independent political parties were springing up . The people had not lost hope .
