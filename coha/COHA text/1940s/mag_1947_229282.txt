( See Cover ) <P> In the big white house on Tor Ridge , west of the Hudson , a light burned all through the winter night . Inside , in a cavernous studio , it glared down on a drawing board where a heavyset , black-haired man put careful strokes on a paneled page . He ignored the accusing clock at his back , but sometimes paused for sips of coffee . Once he dozed off , and his ' pen scratched a crazy zigzag down the sheet . It was daylight when Milton Caniff took off his glasses , pushed his work away and stumbled off to bed . <P> Behind him , on the desk , he left his night 's work : the last Sunday comic page of Terry and the Pirates he would ever draw . Its frames held deftly drawn figures , caught in the restrained gestures of a farewell . The fadeout was appropriately up-to-the-minute : a transport plane lifting into a sky that was streaked like the wan sunrise outside his studio . <P> Whether Terry Lee and Jane Allen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had surrendered his godlike right over them and their actions , which he had guided for eleven years past . Next week , in 220 newspapers including papers as far away as the Times of Seoul , Korea , Milton Caniff 's byline will appear on a new comic strip , to be known as Steve Canyon . <P> In the never-never world of the funnies , this was the news of the year-comparable to Henry Ford quitting his motor company and setting up shop in competition across the street . It was a move involving three of the biggest U.S. press lords : the Chicago Tribune 's Colonel Robert Rutherford McCormick ( who lost Caniff ) , and Marshall Field and William Randolph Hearst , who gained him . For Caniff himself , it meant a guarantee of $520,000 for his next five years ' work , and a stiff challenge-to outdo the best of his past . <P> There may be professors of journalism who have never heard of Milton Caniff 's Terry and the Pirates , but every U.S. newspaper publisher has . Many a publisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does in seeing that Palestine or North China is properly covered . Highbrows had once dismissed the comics as the poor man 's literature ; now to read at least one of them ( usually Terry ) was proof of being a regular fellow . ( After all , had n't Dickens begun Pickwick Papers as a text for a cartoon series ? ) Only the New York Times , among major U.S. dailies , refuses to run comics . <P> Innocents &; a Broad . Cartoonist Caniff 's contribution to the industry was to throw in some curves and give it glamor . Long before he came along the " comics " had generally ceased to be funny . They had learned a thing or two about narrative from Sidney Smith 's chinless Gumps and Frank King 's morality play about the Wallets of Gasoline Alley . But mostly their idea of action was to have a character jump out of his shoes . Into Terry and the wartime Male Call ( for the G.I. press ) Caniff poured fast-breaking dialogue , credible adventure - and one touch of Venus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( he has no others ) seem real . His Dragon Lady , Burma and Miss Lace were fashioned after lush , living models .
