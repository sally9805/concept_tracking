The Alternative to Fascism A Proposal for American-British Cd6peration IT IS A WASTE OF TIME to argue whether the United States should enter the war . We are already in the - war and have been for several years ? long before the fighting changed from economic weapons to military ones . In recent months our status has been openly recognized as that of a non-belligerent ally of Great Britain . The one important question before us is how to make our cooperation most effective . It is clear that a majority of the American people now believe that we should extend the utmost aid to Great Britain even if it involves a considerable danger of going to war . The time may come when this attitude will bring us into the conflict . At present , however , such a development is considered undesirable even from Great Britain 's point of view , by thoughtful Americans and Britons who are considering chiefly what will best serve to defeat Hitler and everything for which he stands , throughout the world . In the meantime , we are capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some of the important aspects of this effort are in fields where little or nothing is now being done . We need first of all bold and imaginative thinking , and in the second place a realistic view of a situation where most of us are inclined to sentimentalize or to refuse to face facts because they are unpleasant . There are two things going on in the world . One is a war and the other is a rapid general change which is partly a revolution and partly an evolution . It now looks as though the war might be a long one , a matter of several years at least . The other process , however , may not wait for the war in any of its phases . It is proceeding at differing rates of speed in different areas . Its results may prove even more important than those of the blitzkrieg against England , may in the long run prove decisive . The world development is based upon the desire of the great masses of men everywhere to find a principle by which to live . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is coupled with , the urgent desire for a better way of life , more free from fear than in the past , and in a strictly material sense , for adequate food , clothing , a home ; for a job and some security for the futures for a culture which raises humanity above the level of the beasts and holds within itself the promise of continued growth and movement . In past ages , formalized religion , in the Western world mostly through the Catholic Church , tried to satisfy this hunger of the soul . It was perhaps able to do so because , in spite of desperate , widespread poverty , there was a fundamental assumption that standards of living would not sink below a certain minimum point . The world seemed a hard , rough place but , with the Church for refuge , in some degree a stable one . The things men had most to fear , aside from war , were natural disasters : famines , hurricanes , eruptions , plagues . Lost : A Sense of Security. ? Today , for fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this sense of security has disappeared throughout the entire Occident and most of the Orient as well . The masses of mankind have now come face to face with an insecurity so great as to threaten the very fundamentals of their existence , in spite of ma terial conditions that have not changed for the worse , and have in many instances been bettered . It is thc last and greatest paradox of human history that when machines have arrived to set men free from most of the burden of their toil , when science has unlocked store- , houses of a richness undreamt of in the past , at that very moment the world should be plunged into an unparalleled period of hunger , misery and fear , or as John Bunyan would have said , a Slough of Despond . Nature abhors a vacuum ; the dreadful conditions sketched above have proved the ideal opportunity for the expansion of the Nazi-Fascist philosophy . That philosophy is in great part a false one . It lies when it says there is truth only according to its own special revelations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paramount and the individual exists but to serve its practically supernatural purposes . It lies when it pretends that there are superior races who by virtue of that superiority may trample at will on the supposedly inferior people . Its main purposes are evil and its doctrine in the long run is one of despair . In the short run , however , it has proved enormously effective in reaching frightened , unhappy and miserable people , as well as frustrated neurotics of a certain type who appear in large numbers in contemporary urban civilization . It gives these people a way of life when they feel des perately in need of one . It furnishes a discipline when their inward resources are inadequate for that purpose . It gives them a catchword ? and we now know that mankind does not live by bread alone but by bread and phrases . That is why the Nazi doctrines have captured the imagination of numbers of people in every country in the world . That is why there were fifth columns waiting and working in Paris , Brussels , Amsterdam and Oslo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , Chicago , Toronto , Mexico City , Buenos Aires and Chungking . True , Germany lit.s poured out enorrnous sums on propaganda . She has peppered the world with her agents in the guise of business men , students , tourists . But her most powerful weapon has been the fact that millions of people were insecure , uncertain , without any firm and glowing faith . Yet there is no reason in the world why Nazism should ever gain a foothold anywhere ( except at the point of a gun ) unless democracy and the democrats have abdicated their function . That function , obviously , is not only to guard the principles of liberty in thought and deed , but also to see to it that the humblest member of the community , along with the highest , never runs short of the necessities of life and of the abundant fruits of our civilization . Bold vision and a sweeping plan are indicated here . Let us first summarize in outline some ideas that are being discussed at present by experts in these matters , on both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Let the United States and Great Britain jointly assume responsibility and leadership for the whole world , except that part of it at present under the heel of the totalitarians . Let these two great repositories of democracy pool their leadership in brains , vision and courage . Let them participate jointly in such economic , industrial and cultural activities as may grow out of this undertaking . Let them begin with the determination that a certain minimum standard of life must be set up and maintained throughout all countries where they are able to operate . Let them determine further that the welfare of the inhabitants of these regions shall be the paramount and only decisive consideration , instead of the maximum profit for British or American exporters or other business men . Let them recognize the principle that no country is in a safe and strong position until it has the proper balance between industry and agriculture so that it can supply the utmost proportion of its needs from its own material resources and manpower , in fact , its " capital . " In the past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have maintained a policy of what amounts to economic peonage for other countries , endeavoring to keep them mainly producers of agricultural surpluses to be exchanged for the exporting nations ' manufactured goods . Deep poverty among masses of people and great economic insecurity are the necessary concomitants of such a system . How does this apply to the present dilemma ? The war has disrupted trade throughout the world . In certain countries great surpluses have accumulated and are reaching an explosive situation . South America , for example , formerly sent more than half of its exports to Europe , a third to the United States , and only five percent was exchanged among the Latin nations in this hemisphere . At the present time in the Americas there are critical problems in relation to Canadian wheat , Brazilian coffee , Cuban . sugar and Mexican oil . Hardly less serious is the situation in every other American country , and with tobacco , corn , nitrates , hog products and beef . The United States is the only country in the New World that has the beginnings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing structure of professions and social services . Every other nation , including Canada , must still export agricultural and other raw materials to bring in needed machinery and consumer goods . With trade in its present situation , we are rushing toward a debacle at terrifying speed . Even when things were best , there has been deep poverty in most of the Latin countries . Foreman and Raushenbush , in their invaluable book , " Total Defense , " r give some figures on the average annual income per capita among our Southern neighbors : the Argentine , $275 ; the Dominican Republic , $150 ; Uruguay , $110 ; Venezuela , $85 ; Chile , $80 ; Honduras , $80 ; Nicaragua , $50 . For all Latin America , it is perhaps $100 , but if you take out the people of wealth , you find that , for seven out of ten , the average is about $20 . Compare this with the United States ' figure of $575 . How to tackle this problem ? Great Britain has a magnificent merchant fleet , men experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her own self-preservation , to offset Hitler 's influence . She also controls , actually though not nominally , the resources of vast areas with enormous populations and much real and potential wealth ? India , Australia , New Zealand , Canada , the greater part of Africa . The United States has some shipping , a tremendous amount of gold that is not doing anybody any good ( including the sums earmarked for special account , about twenty billion dollars ' worth ) , some experience and training in foreign trade and the world 's greatest industrial equipment and personnel . If these two countries stood together , neither one trying to gain a mean advantage for itself , but both genuinely working in the interest of all the people of the world , they would be invincible even if times were normal . With abnormal conditions like the present , their strength is greatly enhanced . The United States and Great Britain have powerful potential assets , moral and physical , for cooperative effort . They could , jointly , engage in organized policing of the trade routes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we now realize for the first time and fully that we live in a world of wolves and not of sheep . With organized policing can go organized international trade , of which the urgent necessity has been steadily growing more apparent for many years past . A Possible Proposal . ? Suppose these two countries were to say , for example , to the wheat producers of the world something like the following : " We shall buy your surplus production of this and previous years and take it off your hands . We shall do this , however , only if you will promise in future to reduce your production to the amount normally needed , so that surpluses will not continue to accumulate , year after year . We must be permitted to send in our experts and advisers to help your people carry out this task and also , putting it bluntly , to make sure that what is promised is fulfilled . " We further propose that everyone in your country who is now going hungry shall be fed , whether he can afford to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; few indeed are the cases where a man starves while jingling coins in his trousers pocket . ) If he is ragged and shoeless , if his house lacks a decent roof , these matters will also be remedied . When necessary , we shall lend to your government sums for these purposes , of course putting in advisers and auditors of our own to make sure that no funds actually get diverted to the sticky fingers of any avaricious politicos . " We shall help you to start industries of your own , of whatever sort you need the most . If Brazil for instance requires a steel mill , we shall not permit the United States steel interests to block this enterprise in order to preserve their own export market . " What remains of your real surplus of wheat will be distributed throughout the world on a basis of efficiency and economy , and not on a basis of making as much money as possible for any given firm or group of business men , or to strengthen the position of one great country against another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the ships available and the distances to be traversed . If other things are equal , it shall flow out of a producing country on a basis determined by its share of the world market in the past . If , for instance , importing nations were to take one-half as much wheat as before , each exporting nation would be permitted to send one-half of its previous quantity . " You would of course be obliged to sign a firm contract with us for the handling of your entire surplus . We could not afford to offer these extremely generous terms and then find that we were solving only part of your problem . " qt would be part of the agreement that all exports from all countries would be made at controlled prices . Otherwise one country with comparatively small exports could sell them at a low price and thus break the market for other countries whose exports might be ten or twenty times as great in quantity . In the past , nations have charged their own people high prices in order to dump their surplus products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future , if there is to be any dumping , let it be at home . Let us charge our859 foreign customers a higher price and give the advantage to our own citizens . " Beginning with Wheat . ? There is no insuperable obstacle to having President Roosevelt call a worldwide wheat conference , with the support and cooperation of Great Britain , and work out a solution along these lines . And once it had been done for wheat , it could be done for coffee . And sugar . And oil . And every other commodity of which there is an undistributed surplus at the present time . Of course all agreements arrived at in this way should be open ones ; all other countries throughout the world should be free to adhere to the treaty at any future time and thenceforth enjoy its advantages . You could not possibly have a more powerful inducement to those countries which are hesitating on the brink of going Nazi or have already done so and are even now beginning to regret it . We have spoken here of surpluses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various countries there are large quantities of unsold goods . But these represent excess production only in terms of the present market , not in terms of human needs . It is doubtful whether the entire world is producing more of anything than could be used in bringing mankind up to even a bare minimum of decent life . The phrase that we should use might be " temporary surplus " or better yet , " illusory surplus . " There are great potentialities for increased consumption of goods , even without sweeping reorganization , with scientific control and regularization of present trade channels . To an important extent , goods might be exchanged that are now standing in warehouses partly because of mental inertia on the part of traders , partly because shipping tonnage is not intelligently allocated , or because of tariffs and other restrictions that have survived from an older era into a day when they do an increasing amount of harm . As long as people , willing and able to work , are hungry or ill clad in any part of the world , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As far as Latin America is concerned , the scheme outlined has one overwhelming and specific advantage . It removes the pressing danger that Hitler will conquer the Latin countries one by . one , not by military but by economic means . If we look ahead several decades , Europe will probably no longer import foodstuffs and other products from Latin America as it did before the war . No matter what their political arrangements may be , the European nations will become increasingly self-sufficient . When the agriculture of the Balkans has been brought up to the level of productivity already reached in the Low Countries and Denmark , Europe will need very little from the rest of the world except those few tropical products or metals that can not be provided within her own borders . For the next few years , and perhaps for ten or twenty , however , she will need imports , and as long as Hitler remains in his present position , the purchase of these imports will become part of an elaborate bargaining process for the purpose of strengthening Germany 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , that Great Britain will permit Latin American agricultural products to go through the blockade to Europe ( or that the blockade for any reason is no longer effective ) , what shall we see ? Hitler 's Economic War. ? Hitler will certainly try to pick off the Latin countries one by one , offering to buy their agricultural surpluses and to pay for them with German manufactured goods . The bargain in the long run is likely to prove disastrous . German prices on exports , when closely examined , will turn out to be very high . The Reich will have no hesitancy in substituting one type of goods for another , some of them grotesquely unfitted to the needs of the people who get them . Worse than that , the agricultural surplus of a given country will be dumped recklessly on the world market , breaking the price of that country 's own normal exports and satiating some of its own normal customers . At the same time , Germany will move in upon each country with which she has made such a bargain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun to do in every country in the New World . Its newspapers will be given German advertising ? provided , of course , that their editorial policies are properly Nazified . Radio stations will be subsidized to send out Hitler material ; receiving sets that can be tuned only to these stations will be sold below cost or given away . The Germans will continue to go to great lengths to make friends with the native population , settling down among them for life , marrying into their best families , learning to speak the language ? all things which the proud and haughty Briton and the only slightly less proud and haughty American disdain to do . To prevent the loss of South America it is imperative that a plan be presented that will make it impossible for Germany to divide and conquer . No such scheme has any hope of success unless it begins by solving the economic problem Yet neither Britain nor America , nor the two of them combined , can hope to keep up with the torrent of surplus production by simply buying it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Obstacles v. Alternatives. ? That there are obstacles to such a plan we are well aware ; there are obstacles to everything in life , down to getting on a street car at the rush hour . But we should look not at the obstacles but the alternatives . The alternatives , and we weigh our words , are economic ruin in this hemisphere and an increased chance of success for Hitler in his paranoiac dream of world domination . Would the nations in the British Commonwealth play fair in such a plan ? No final guarantee can be given , but we feel the chances are excellent that they would . Britain has her back to the wall ; at home she is rapidly turning capitalism from its predatory character to constructive uses ; why should she continue to tolerate its older activities abroad , especially when to do so may threaten her very existence ? To be sure , there are still greedy , selfish and shortsighted men in England , some of them in high places . But there are also men who have a vision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being , not merely in generations or in decades but in years , a world in which the productive forces of our new civilization are no longer throttled down by an archaic social system . A favorable response from America would greatly hearten these men , of whom there are an increasing number and in increasingly responsible posts , and would give them more power to deal with the obstructionists . Would the Americans play fair ? One can no more give guarantees for them than one can for their British Commonwealth cousins . Yet obviously there is a good chance . The plan outlined above is roughly an application of the principles of the New Deal on a much wider scale . At the same time , there is nothing impractical or Utopian about it . The sums of money involved are by no means staggering , and when we deduct the profits earned from the outlays undertaken , they become still less important . They are certainly insignificant compared with the cost of Britain 's war or America 's defense program . In this country , too , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems that an abnormally large percentage of them have concerned themselves with the affairs of the hemisphere republics . Yet the exploiters of the Latin Americans can be curbed and muzzled , just as we are learning to do with the exploiters of our own people here at home . Curtailing " Healthy Competition . " ? What would happen to this plan if , partly by its help , Hitler were at last defeated and the world set free from its long bad dream ? Should we not have destroyed the basis for healthy competition between American and British traders in the markets of the world ? We should , indeed ; and this is one of the strongest merits of the proposal . After all these decades we have at last waked up to the very great harm that is done by competition in foreign trade , by the overequipment it produces in the exporting countries , the appalling waste , in duplication of facilities , the capitalist exploitation of hapless peons who must work hard for a foreign slave master who holds his position partly because he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to bring them home again . Such a plan as has been described would of course have many other aspects than the ones listed . In regard to Latin America , some of these things are already under way . We need for example , a vast increase in friendly contact among the peoples of the three Americas . We need to appreciate each other 's culture , learning in humility that all the arts and philosophies are not found exclusively within our own borders . We need a great network of first-class automobile roads threading up and down and back and forth on two continents , connecting neighboring countries whose only access now is by sea , joining all of them with the United States and all the other countries north and south . We need exchanges of students and faculties among the Spanish , Portuguese and -English-speaking universities . We need to read each other 's books , both classic and contemporary . We need steamship fares far lower than they are now , with increased government subsidies when necessary to bring this about . Most of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must break down the inertia of traditionalism . We must think hard about whether we really want a democratic world order in opposition to the pressing challenge of the Nazi one . If the answer is Yes , we must be prepared to go very far indeed away from our old habits of thought and action to bring it about .
