 | Parting is difficult , but it does n't have to be tragic . There is an art to saying good-bye . It involves more than handkerchief waving and the stemming of tears until ' after the train has pulled out . Correct good-byes give warmth and uplift . Slipshod good-byes leave a pall of uneasiness that can linger for days . One remembers the good-bye look , the last expression in the eyes , the final words . If the absence is long , these good-bye remembrances grow sharper . Have n't you often heard people say : " I remember when we said good-bye . It seems like yesterday " ? When you say good-bye , you are taking part in a drama that , on the stage of remembrance , may give repeated performances for weeks , months , or even years . How well do you prepare for a role of such importance ? Or do you prepare at all ? You should prepare . You should live the moment several times over in advance , just as your husband does before he asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tough customer . First , set your stage . The goodbye must be planned and carried out calmly and without hurry , completely avoiding the hasty , lastminute , confused , and hysterical good-byes that make parting torturous . Know where you are going to say good-bye , and when , and under what circumstances . If you choose the railroad or bus station , get there at least twenty minutes early and have ticket details ironed out in advance . Most important today is the good-bye to a man in the service . It is a difficult good-bye and a supremely touching one . All the more vital to make it successful . First consideration should , of course , go to the man . He is off to strangeness and uncertainty . You are remaining home , in the same warmth and familiarity as ever . To place your sacrifice above his would be prime selfishness . Yet many wives , mothers , sisters do so , inadvertently , by losing hold of themselves so that the service man must stand around comforting them and leave with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember his feelings . Make your good-bye bespeak pride , good cheer , and strength : " We 're terribly proud of you , son . " " Keep smiling , Jim , and we 'll keep smiling , too . " " Do n't worry about us , dear ? take good care of yourself . " Yes , you 've heard all those lines before . They are tried and true . Use them . If you say good-bye at home , a happy ceremony can erase the pangs of parting . A family party , with going-away gifts , perhaps . A gathering of old friends . Or a special dinner . Make it a great day , a proud day ? not a dismal one . If the final good-byes are said at a railroad station , there are two things to remember : keep off the train and avoid an anticlimax . When you insist on getting aboard the train , you only invite that jittery feeling of wondering whether you 'll get off in time . Far better intentionally to complete your good-byes five minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car windows , if you must . Do n't let the talk drag on and on . Say your farewell piece , kiss , clasp hands ? and say goodbye . There are few things less impressive than the good-bye that drivels into endless repetitions . If your daughter is going away to college , the good-byes are much simpler ; but they , too , can be muffed . Parents are bloated with advice when a girl goes off to school . But the railroad station is n't the place to transmit it . Daughter will be fully occupied with her attire , her luggage , her tickets , and her emotions . There also will be a flood of last-minute questions and the inevitable , " Do n't forget to tell Jane , etc . " In this good-bye the best you can do is @#  | maintain calmness and stability . Give your advice a day or two in advance , when you have the time and proper atmosphere . If there still is some advice left over , put it in a train letter . Girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you write in a train letter will be read over and over ? and sink in . Suppose your daughter is going off to work in Washington or in the state capital . It is the same sort of parting , with an added dash of maturity . You have a chance to be inspirational . Such lines as , We know you 'll work hard and make us proud of you , " often leave strong impressions . But whether your daughter is off to school or off to work , there will be some pangs . Anticipate them . Think all about the " out in the world " business in advance . Do n't let the realization suddenly catch you unaware . And if you must cry ? and who 's to tell a woman not to ? ? wait until you get home . Your pillow wo n't be hurt , but your daughter might have her spirits needlessly depressed if you lose control in her presence . She 'll cry , too ? it 's contagious ? and what does it get you ? SUPPOSE your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake of his peace of mind , and his business , he should be given a businesslike good-bye . Such good-byes are best accomplished at home . Perhaps a leisurely half-hour of going over your arrangements ( " Pay the electric bill , but do n't do anything about the new icebox until I get home " ) and then the same pleasant good-bye your husband would be entitled to if he were going downtown to his office . Do n't spring anything disquieting at the last minute . What kind of trip is your husband in for if , ten minutes before he leaves , you remark : " You know , the stove 's been leaking . I wonder if that 's dangerous at night ? " If you have n't been prudent enough to mention that before , have it attended to yourself ? after he 's gone . Avoid last-minute avalanches of things you 've wanted to tell him " a million times , but kept forgetting . " Anything forgotten that long can well be forgotten a bit longer . In a day or two , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain such eleventh-hour items . A buoyant , enthusiastic , unworried departure is sure to enhance the success of ur husband 's trip . It is equally certain t bickering or arguing during the t half-hour provides a devastating per . You 've known times when a kering good-bye has spoiled your enday and your husband 's , too . Why e a chance on spoiling an entire trip ? You can learn a great deal from the y good-bye , day in and day out . ve n't you noticed that it sets the key the entire day , as a pitch pipe sets e key for a chorus ? How many times ve you been miserable for hours beuse of a rough good-bye ? Bickering in farewell moment is nothing short of utual punishment . Treat the farewell moment reverently. ver risk spoiling it with last-minute arks about your headaches , or how u worry about Junior 's crossing streets . k rather of the pleasant side of things , at a good report card Junior received , how nicely your budget is working  | out . Remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home ! Some good-byes are unavoidably sad . There is the going away because of an illness or sorrow in the family . Here , the strain of parting is secondary and the good-bye should be automatic . Do n't complicate it . The less said the better . There is a chronic problem of parting if you have children , perhaps married sons or daughters , living out of town . Perhaps they come home for Thanksgiving and Easter for brief visits . Why make each of these repeated partings a separate problem ? Why wrench emotions unnecessarily ? We get used anything by repetition . Adopt a set pattern for these repeated partings , and yo . can get used to them , too . Each subsequent one becomes a bit easier . Adopt a formula . Not an obviously artificial one , such as telling a funny story at the last minute . Rather , a simplified , well-planned routine . The hour of departure should be established well in advance , to avoid the heart-tugs that s with " stay another day " debates . The partings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same circumstances , at the same place , and at the same time of day ? each time . One simply gets used to it faster that way . In such repeated partings , you 've had a chance to steel yourself against emotional upsets . You 've been able to discover the cheerful , hopeful things to cling to . Speak of the happy time you 've had together , and how much fun you are going to have the next time . Remember , the words and feelings of these parting moments will flavor all the letters that go back and forth until the next visit . Stress the joy of reunion , not the pangs of parting . You 'll feel better . So will the sons or daughters , who will remember how grand you were at the station .
