Christmas in July ( Paramount ) , previously titled Cup of Coffee and Ants in Their Pants , is the cinema success about poor people in Manhattan which , after so many recent tries , the law of averages made inevitable . Written and directed by Hollywood 's latest Fair-Haired Boy-kinetic Preston Sturges ( The Great McGinty ) - produced for a paltry $325,000 , it once again gives the lie to the arbitrary Hollywood assumption that a film 's quality is in direct proportion to its cost . <P> As scenarist , Sturges wrote a tender little tale about 24 hours in the life of Jimmy MacDonald ( Dick Powell ) , a perennial slogan contestant who is out for Maxford House Coffee Co. ' s $25,000 prize . Powell is a $22-a-week comptometer clerk with three practical-joking friends who paste together a bogus telegram notifying him he has won the contest . By dint of some improbable inefficiency in the Maxford House organization , he collects the check , spends a sizable slice of it before the hoax is bared . <P> As director , Sturges converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a Chaplinesque background of pathos . He ably remodeled Powell from the vacuous crooner of Warner Brothers musicals into a convincing prototype of a drudge with a dream of sudden wealth with which he can buy his mother a convertible settee and his girl a fancy wedding . Pale-faced , canyon-mouthed Ellen Drew , a onetime Hollywood soda clerk , was coached into a realistic likeness of a sugary , $18-a-week stenographer . A good dramatist , Sturges kept his characters credible by the simple but neglected technique of letting them act like people . For instance , when the Maxford House president is writing out Powell 's contest check , he pauses to ask : " Do you spell your name Me or Mac ? "
