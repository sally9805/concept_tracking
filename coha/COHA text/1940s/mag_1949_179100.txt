Husky Ralph J. Bunche , the U.S. diplomat who negotiated the Palestine armistice for U.N. , went to the White House last week for a talk with Harry Truman . The President had asked him to become an Assistant Secretary of State , the highest Government post ever offered a Negro . Bunche was greatly honored , he told President Truman-but he had decided to turn it down . <P> To White House reporters Bunche gave two tactful reasons : he felt his U.N . job ( as director of the trusteeship department ) was important ; he could not afford to take a salary cut from his tax-free $14,000 at U.N . to a taxable $10,000 as an Assistant Secretary of State . <P> But 44-year-old Ralph Bunche did not mention his most compelling reason . As an Assistant Secretary of State he would be one of the top Government officials in Washington . But as a Negro , he would be barred from most restaurants , hotels and clubs in Washington . Bunche had gotten his fill of Washington before ( as a specialist in OSS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other officials of his rank lived in the more convenient Northwest section of the city , he built a home in the Southeast quarter . Around the corner from him was a public school , but it was for white children ; Bunche had to send his two daughters to a Negro school nearly three miles away . There were other complications . Item : last March the fashionable Wardman Park Hotel refused a meeting room to the Middle East Institute when it learned that Bunche was scheduled to speak . <P> Before he was offered the new job , able Ralph Bunche told a friend how he felt about Washington . " Frankly , " he said , " it 's a Jim Crow town and I would n't relish exposing my family to it again . " <P> Taking his cue from the Hoover plan for Government reorganization , President Truman last week created posts for four new Assistant Secretaries of State ( one of which was offered to Bunche ) , giving the department eight in all , and two new posts labeled Deputy Under Secretary .
