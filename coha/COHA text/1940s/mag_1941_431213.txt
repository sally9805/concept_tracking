HOW many airports is enough ? America needs between 3,500 and 4,000 , according to the Civil Aeronautics Administration , which has planned the nation 's airport-construction program . This program was presented to Congress in March , 1939 , and was based on expansion of civil and commercial aviation anticipated at that time . The war crisis has since forced the emphasis to be removed from civilian flying and concentrated on military aviation . As a result , changes in the design and placing of the airports have been made , but , according to the C.A.A. , the total number needed still remains the same . Can we produce them ? We can , and more if necessary . The need is for cooperation between the Federal and local governments in allotting funds , sites , and materials . Congress appropriated 40 million dollars last fall to get the program under way . Eighty million more was added in July to continue the work . Many more millions will be needed if the program is to be completed as outlined . Are we producing them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its first appropriation a year ago , 200 airport projects were started . Nearly $19,000 , - 000 of the second appropriation is being used to complete 113 of these airports . The rest is going toward a string of 288 new ones around the perimeter of the United States . Military airports are most needed along the Atlantic , Gulf , and Pacific coasts , which must be defended strategically and because of their industrial concentrations . In New England , for example , including New York , a total of 55 projects costing $14,259,670 have been started . In other Atlantic Coast areas an additional $15,286,000 will be spent . For work along the Gulf Mexico $12,950,000 is allotted and along the Pacific Coast , $8,006,000 . Small , self-contained cities are actually , springing up around the country as these C.A.A . projects and the vast flying fields being built by the Army take shape . The larger airports , in addition to actual landing storage , and repair facilities for aircraft  | oust provide their own power , heating , sewrage , and water services . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even miles of roads and railroad spurs . The C.A.A. , realizing that America has never taken advantage of its waterways for aviation , is also speeding a program to develop seaplane bases , on lakes and rivers as yell as along the coasts . Seaplane bases have many advantages . They cost less to develop and maintain than airports . Airports can be destroyed by bombs . Water landing areas can not . The C.A.A . embarked in the Spring of 1939 on a plan to install seaplane docks on a national scale . The National Youth Administration built the bases to C.A.A . specifications with materials furnished by local communities . Already more than 200 have been completed . Another recent development which may  | prove to be important to the nation 's airport program is the construction of flight strips along federal highways . The first real test of flight strips was projected lay Congress in the emergency road bill . The idea was developed by the Army for emergency military landings and as possible points for scattering combat planes in case of attack . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of flight strips for commercial projects and as centers of aviation activity in rural areas . Rent of hangar space would boost farmers ' incomes . The airport program may also be aided by another new idea which promises to reduce the cost of airport construction . That is the use of soil cement for runways . First tried on country roads , soil cement is a method of stabilizing ordinary earth . The method is simple . The earth is scarified and pulverized with harrows to a depth of six inches . A thin layer of cement is spread over the surface and mixed with the soil . Then water is added with a pressure distributor . The surface is then rolled , covered with a thin bituminous wearing surface and left to dry under straw . It costs about $1 a square yard , half the cost of concrete . Soil cement is now being tested at the Fort Wayne , Ind. , airport . If it proves it can take it , the way will be opened to use soil cement on hundreds of other projects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these developments may have on the airport program . But to understand what is going on now in the program it is necessary to know something of how airports have been built in the past in the United States . Until the C.A.A . got its first appropriation last fall , the Federal Government had considered that the building of civilian airport- was the responsibility of local communities . The C.A.A . had for years been advising municipalities to plan and build systems of airports just as they do park systems . Had this been done , civil aviation would not now be on the spot because of the occupation of so many airports by the Army and Navy . The failure to heed the C.A.A . ' s advice is proving serious in the present emergency . but the blame can not be heaped on the shoulders of city fathers alone . When the aviation bubble first drifted across the national horizon many local governments , in the carefree rapture of the middle twenties . floated long-term bonds and bought up fields for airports . Not much was known about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost money . With the arrival of the  | depression they became white elephants . But the depression also brought federal work relief and public works projects . One of the most obvious places to dump some of these public funds was in airport construction . Some exceedingly valuable facilities were built in this way . By the end of 1941 about $371 , - 000,000 will have been spent for airports through F.E.R.A. , C.W.A. , P.W.A. , and W.P.A. projects . Now , in the defense emergency , they are beginning to pay dividends . Only when the war clouds began to blow toward America did the Federal Government decide to give the C.A.A . funds for airports . Because of the limited funds made available , it was imperative to get the most for the least . Hence it was decided that not one C.A.A . penny could be spent for land or buildings . This leaves the responsibility on local communities to provide the sites , erect the buildings , and maintain and operate the fields . The C.A.A . supplies only actual landing facilities such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , counties ,  | and states , are falling in line with this plan and the C.A.A . ' s long-range program is going ahead to create a network of airports keyed to tomorrow 's needs . And what are tomorrow 's needs ? For the immediate future they are predominantly military . For the future that may be in store when the fury of the war has burned out , they will be civil and commercial . But civilian needs may be infinitely greater as an aftermath of the present military expansions . Tremendous new airplane factories , some of them among the largest industrial plants in the world , are now rising . Thousands of skilled mechanics are being trained and employed in aircraft production . Imagine the rate at which these plants and men may some day be able to turn out small training , private  | and commercial airplanes ! Price reductions will accompany such quantity production , provided of course that a market is available . By the beginning of 1942 the Army , Navy , and C.A.A . will be turning out pilots at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those who will continue to learn to fly at their own expense , promise to provide such a market to keep aircraft production at a high peak after the war . If this happens , and many believe it will , we must be certain that the airport system being built for national defense can be salvaged and converted easily to civilian and commercial uses . Aviation experts say that , with a few relatively simple changes , it can .  |
