The curtain rises . West 47th Street , near Ninth Avenue , seen from an odd vantage point . To the left , we seem to be looking down at the summer garden back of a corner bar . Above it , various parts of signs can be seen . They read : " BAR " AND " GRILL . " " ROCCO 'S . AIR-COOLED . AIR-CONDITIONED . COOLER INSIDE . " And the inevitable neon " TELEVISION . " A spare , elderly man sits at a little table . He is Roy McGreevy , known as MAC . On the table is a pile of books and three beer glasses . Two are empty , the third almost . To the right we look up at a roof with skylight and a series of windows which look onto it . Framed by her window , Mrs. Luigi Gallo , called " SODA " because she is forever drinking it , sits and surveys the world . Center , we look straight at the two upper stories , and roof of SODA 's rooming house at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the following legend is legible : " TO LET : REHEARSAL STUDIOS BY HR. , W.K. , OR MO .  --  FURNISHED ROOMS BY DAY OR WK.  --  APARTMENTS ( HSKPING ) 1-1/2 , 2-1/2. 3-1/2 . APPLY SUPT . WITHIN . MRS . L. GALLO . " Beyond can be seen the more impressive buildings of the city and the trammeled roofs and streets which lie between . Aerials ( one with a captured kite ) , wash-lines , pigeon hutches and a water tower . Further still is the sky which holds , from time to time , the full spectrum of color . Milk wagons , taxis , musicians , children and peddlers take their places in the synchronized sounds of the passing day . MAC looks out at the audience . MAC Three beers and right away I start talking . That 's me . Whoever happens to be standing handy  --  or sitting handy , I do n't care . One thing I 'm not is particular . McGreevy 's the name . Did I mention that ? Roy McGreevy ? Occupation , nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty years . I been a sign painter by trade , mostly . I done more gold leaf  --  you no doubt seen my work a thousand times . We used to say around the shop , " You got to have a steady hand and a steady job ! " Now I 'm Social Security . So , in a way , you support me . Thanks . ( He sips his beer ) I been sittin ' here an hour worryin ' what 's the matter with me . Now , I 've decided , hell  --  there 's something the matter with everybody ! ( Another sip ) For instance . Over here across the street where I live there 's a girl got a room two above me . Helen . Tell you her trouble . Livin ' in the past . ( Lights come up gradually inside the center building , and through the walls and wiring and plumbing we begin to see Helen 's room . It is small and oddly shaped . With the ingenuity of the impoverished , it has been made comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a curtain has been hung around a small washstand . The screened sections are not completely hidden from view . There is an upright piano in the room , locked and unused . And old . In the rear wall , a small arch leads to sleeping quarters . Only by stretching language out of shape can this place be called a bedroom . It is not a room at all . It holds a bed , a small dresser , a chair , and no more . The bed , brass , can be seen crowding three walls . The room is uninhabited . Somewhere , within hearing , a trumpet player is doping a chorus of " You Go To My Head " in emulation of the late Bunny Berigan . He goes on with this throughout the scene . Across the street , a trap drummer who was born without a sense of rhythm is attempting to acquire one . Directly below , an arranger is working at his piano , pumping gaiety into a sad little tune . HELEN comes into the room from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrongly . She is barefooted . She wears a skirt , but no blouse as yet , only a brassiere . Her hair is piled top of her head . She is smoking . Over the curtain rod at the a Turkish towel holds two pairs of silk stockings , drying . HELEN comes down , feels them , selects the dryer pair , and sits down to put them on . SODA now starts up with the audience by leaning out of her window another notch , holding up her pop bottle and inquiring ) p. 3 SODA You know why they call this kind " cream soda " ? I do n't . It ai n't cream after all . ( She sucks her straw ) MAC That Helen ! I do n't know how old she is but she ca n't be very . I would say about twenty-six , but then Helen herself says she 's twenty-six so I figure she 's about thirty-one . ( Back to his beer ) SODA She 's forty , that 's a fact . Forty and a half , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She finishes the bottle , noisily , and drops the straw out of the window . Now she puts the bottle on the floor beside her and comes up with another . This one contains a flame-colored liquid ) Not real orange  --  it 's chemical  --  but I tell you the way they 're making chemicals today I 'd rather drink it than the regular squeezed . ( She goes to work on the new supply with automatic relish . HELEN takes a last puff of her cigarette and gets a waist out of a drawer ) MAC I talk to her sometimes , but I ca n't help her  --  nobody can but herself , and she wo n't . Given up , she has . But just about the appealingest girl I ever met . SODA She 's a bum . A female bum . She thinks she 's foolin ' everybody she 's foolin ' nobody . Butterflyin ' around . There 's only one thing worse than a pro and that 's a semi-pro , should you ask me . ( HELEN moves nearer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in unsnapping the small snappers of her waist . We hear a whistle  --  loud and shrill  --  the wolf-call . She leaps away from the window , stands back against the wall for a moment in flushed anger , then comes back and shouts across the court ) p. 4 HELEN BROWN If you got nothin ' better to do , you nosey Goddam half-wit ! ! ( She pulls down the shade like an exclamation point . The walls of her room fly away and admit us to view . She gets into her waist , and is on her way out of the room when she is interrupted by a knock ) Yeah ? A VOICE Telephone . HELEN BROWN What ? VOICE Telephone company . HELEN BROWN Yeah , what about ? VOICE Mrs. Helen Brown ? HELEN BROWN What if ? VOICE Bryant 9-8040 ? HELEN BROWN Go ahead . VOICE I have to make a mechanical adjustment , please .

HELEN BROWN I 'm busy . VOICE ( With real emotion ) Please , lady ! ( HELEN hesitates , then goes to work on the door . It is not a small effort , because this door has six locks on it . There is the usual one under the knob . Also , a door bolt ; above that , a cross bolt . Above the knob , a Yale lock , then a door chain . And near the top another heavy patent lock . Each one makes its own noise . The operation takes some time . When she has done unlocking , she pats her hair , and moistens her lips , automatically . She opens the door . An average man walks in , carrying a tool kit ) p. 5 TELEPHONE MAN ( Looking at the locks ) What 's this ? Fort Knox ? HELEN BROWN ( Closing the door ) Very important , you said . TELEPHONE MAN That 's right . HELEN BROWN For you or for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a break . HELEN BROWN Why ? Like what ? TELEPHONE MAN Well , look . Is it my fault I got to remove your phone ? ( He hands her a blue slip ) I got nothin ' to do with it . I just work for a livin ' . HELEN BROWN What do you think I do ? Fat of the land ? TELEPHONE MAN Everybody has the same reaction . Come back , they say , come back later like some miracle is gon na happen if they stall . ( An awkward pause . MAC finishes his beer and leaves , unobtrusively ) There 's no miracles , Mrs. Brown . Not so far anyhow . A bill ai n't paid eighteen days  --  remove instrument . You 'd be surprised how many go . It used to be we used to discontinue service first awhile , then remove . ( Another pause ) But a lot of people got sore with a dead instrument so they used to smash ' em up . You know people , how they are . So now we yank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic , trying not to show it ) p. 6 HELEN BROWN I 'd appreciate you could only come back later . TELEPHONE MAN Look . I 'm supervised , y ' know , same as anybody else . I got to make my showing . Everybody gives me this come-back-later routine how long y ' think I 'm gon na last ? Bad enough how many just ai n't home let alone the comeback-laters . ( He looks around for the phone ) HELEN BROWN How about you giving me a break ? TELEPHONE MAN Nothin ' I can do , lady . HELEN BROWN Sure there is . ( His expert eye has caught the bellbox , followed the cord to a crinoline skirted doll on the table . He peeps under it and sees his phone ) TELEPHONE MAN ( In surprised delight ) Say , I did n't know they still had these . I have n't seen one in  --  HELEN BROWN How about it ? TELEPHONE MAN It 's not me . ( He kneels down and opens his tool kit . HELEN moves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a favor , will you , do n't cut my heart out ? ( He is working on the mechanism with swift efficiency ) My whole living depends . I got to have a phone if not I 'm done . I 'm gon na pay it  --  it takes a minute . p. 7 TELEPHONE MAN What 's your line  --  ( He waits a beat ) sister ? ( His manner changes . He is suddenly predatory ) HELEN BROWN ( Urging softly ) Modelling . I do modelling . ( A pause ) Different kinds . I work dancing a few shifts over at Tango Gardens . But I 'm tryin ' to break into the modelling game . That 's why I. mean about my phone . TELEPHONE MAN Oh . HELEN BROWN Come on . TELEPHONE MAN ( As he goes back to work ) What ? HELEN BROWN Make a mistake . ( He bends toward phone ) Make two mistakes . ( His head snaps back ) In fact . TELEPHONE MAN ( Stopping ) I do n't know . HELEN BROWN ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we care for the telephone company ? They 're on the wealthy side , would n't you say ? TELEPHONE MAN It 's not so easy . HELEN BROWN Figure something . Press a button . Lose a card . Stretch me a couple weeks . You wo n't be sorry . ( He gets up and lights a cigarette . He looks at her . She is saying it all without words ) p. 8 TELEPHONE MAN I do n't think  --  ( He pauses ) HELEN BROWN That 's right . Do n't think . ( They exchange a little laugh . TELEPHONE MAN looks at the card in his hand ) TELEPHONE MAN ( Musing ) Bryant 9-8040 . HELEN BROWN ( Softly ) That 's right . And how you gon na use it if you take it out , you big clown ? ( TELEPHONE MAN , laughing , gives his head one great rueful shake and kneels to his work again . He undoes what we have just seen him do ) TELEPHONE MAN ( After a while ) Join the Navy and see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll do what I can for you , honey . HELEN BROWN Thanks . TELEPHONE MAN Do n't worry about it Still and all  --  I may give you a call at that  --  in case I ever need any modelling . ( He is preparing to leave ) This branch manager we 've got  --  tall fella with an Oldsmobile convertible  --  if you had a friend  --  maybe the four of us two couples sometime ? HELEN BROWN Let 's talk it over . p. 9 TELEPHONE MAN Bryant 9-8040 . ( He jots it into his little book ) He 's got the convertible but I 've got the appeal  --  you know what I mean ? ( He puts his fist against her jaw , gives it a playful mock punch , and goes . HELEN locks all six locks . As she gets to the last one the door is assaulted ) HELEN BROWN Who is it ? SODA 'S VOICE I want a word with you , young lady . HELEN BROWN I 'll give you a word  --  knock off . SODA 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! HELEN BROWN Go take a bath . You need it ! ( The door is being pounded ) SODA 'S VOICE I 'm gon na stay here the whole day  --  I mean it ! HELEN BROWN You want to catch smallpox ? I got smallpox . SODA You open up ! You hear me ? ( Bang ) Hear me ? ( Slap ) Hear me ? ( Kick ) HELEN BROWN ( In a fury of exasperation ) All right ! ( She takes it out on the locks and flings open the door . SODA comes into the room , turns to face HELEN ) p. 10 SODA ( Very quietly ) Close the door , kindly . HELEN BROWN ( Softly ) Why do n't you simply live and let live ? SODA Why do n't you play the game fair and square ? Why do n't you be honest ? HELEN BROWN Because I ca n't afford it . That 's for the luxury trade , honest . SODA You can afford to pay a private telephone you can afford me a increase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? SODA So with what did you pay the phone ? With broke ? HELEN BROWN I did n't . With nothing . SODA If you want to razzle dazzle me you got to get up pretty early in the morning only earlier than you get up in it young lady . HELEN BROWN Who wants to ? SODA He came to take it out the fellow  --  HELEN BROWN So ? SODA So he did n't . Nothing gets by me , girlie , at least not much . Maybe I got no college diplomas hanging on my walls but I been around . HELEN BROWN Not only around but in and out , too , you snoopy old bag ! p. 11 SODA You ca n't insult me . I take it from whence it comes and charge it up to ignorance . I 'm giving you a notice from my counselor  --  the rate starting tomorrow A.M. is two dollars and twenty cents daily . HELEN BROWN Two-twenty ! You know how many tickets I have to dance to make two-twenty ? ( SODA holds out a folded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instinctive fear of touching it and making it legal . SODA , pouncing upon this fear , slaps the document down on a table ) SODA It 's really a room for two people that 's the story . HELEN BROWN Two pigs I guess you must mean because who else would want to ? SODA Ha , ha ! You admit it , you 're a pig . HELEN BROWN I sure in hell do . SODA So then get out . It so happens I do n't cater to no pigs . If you want to pay the rise okay if not you got to get . HELEN BROWN Neither one . SODA I know what to do . HELEN BROWN Sure . You know to pester me pester me pester  --  listen give it up . You make no impression . I been pestered every day of my life one way or the other so I 've got a skin like an alligator if you want to feel it . p. 12 SODA ( As she goes ) No , thank you . ( As she crosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence . There is a startled scream from offstage as the door slams , close behind her . HELEN bolts it . ) SODA 'S VOICE ( Screaming ) I 'll report you ! I 'll report you to the telephone company . ( She slaps the door hard  --  one ! two ! three ! four ! five ! six ! seven ! in swift final desperation and then kicks it three times , slowly , to punctuate the punctuation . The ensuing silence falls restfully on our ears . A moment passes . HELEN comes back into the room and goes to the phone . She dials . From the street , the amplified tinkle of a Good Humor ice-cream wagon fills the air . It stops , apparently close by . Its sound might suggest the Pearly Gates were it not for the prosaic shouts of the vendor ) HELEN BROWN ( On the phone ) Hello , Avis . This is Peggy . Peggy ! Get the wax out ! Anything doing ? I know . I hear the same all over . Still and all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm in bad . No , but I 've got a damn landlady in my hair . Not behind , no , but she wants to raise me. Oh , sure that 's a great idea , thanks for nothing  --  move where to ? Everything seems to be hitting me all at once all of a sudden . Okay , Avis . Try . ( She hangs up , dials again . The sounds of the neighbor musicians fill the room . On the phone again ) Hello , Mildred . This is Joanie . Listen , I 've got some trouble . You think you might be able to give me a call ? I been counting on you . I 'm short of connections as hell . She did ? I thought she only  --  ( A knock ) I have to go , Mildred . I think it 's my trouble . ( Through the door ) Who is it ? ( Into the phone ) Call you back . ( She hangs up ) p. 13 MAC 'S VOICE Mr. McGreevy , Mrs. Brown . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door ) Oh ! ( MAC comes in , eating a Popsicle and carrying another ) I 'm sorry , Mr. McGreevy . MAC ( He hands her a Popsicle ) With my compliments . ( She takes it ) HELEN BROWN Thank you . ( She raises her Popsicle to him in a toast . He responds . She takes a bite ) You want to sit a minute , Mr. McGreevy ? MAC I do n't mind . ( He sits . She does , too ) HELEN BROWN That all right , that chair ? MAC Thank you . Mrs. Brown  --  HELEN BROWN Yes ? MAC Have you got any particular topic of conversation in mind ? HELEN BROWN No . MAC All right if I introduce one ? HELEN BROWN Of course , why not ? MAC Well , Mrs. Brown , my topic is Mr. Brown . p. 14 HELEN BROWN Go ahead . MAC I do n't want you to feel that I feel that a Popsicle gives me rights . But this interests me . HELEN BROWN Yeah . MAC Is there a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HELEN BROWN Where , I could n't tell you . I have n't seen him since November the eighth , 1947 . I got up and looked in the lower berth and he was gone , that 's all . All this was on a train . The Twentieth Century , in fact . MAC Think of that . HELEN BROWN I did n't know if to bust out laughing or crying so I did both . MAC Has there been a divorce ? HELEN BROWN I guess so . I do n't know . I signed plenty of papers , I know . With notary publics and all that . MAC But is that right to call yourself still Mrs. Brown ? I do n't know the law  --  it 's just a point of information . HELEN BROWN I would n't care , law or not . All I know , it saves me a lot of trouble . Misses get their shoulder straps torn much more than Mrs.'s. p. 15 MAC Of course . HELEN BROWN So that 's why . ( They eat their Popsicles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAC takes some interest in his  --  relishing it , savoring it , appreciating it , looking at it now and again . HELEN , on the other hand , nibbles automatically , her mind on other things ) MAC What was the screaming ? Incidentally ? HELEN BROWN Same old . MAC You know what I would do if I was you ? Move . HELEN BROWN And what would you do if you were you ? MAC I 'm talking for your own good . HELEN BROWN Where do I go ? I tried Tampa  --  two years ago already . God ! I took a couple drinks one night my father started cuffin ' me around . Took me a year and a half to make up my mind to go back there  --  took me five minutes to decide to get out again . MAC Bad news . HELEN BROWN I do n't fit in there . MAC No . HELEN BROWN I do n't fit in here , neither , but at least here not so many notices it . You do n't know a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City  --  smallest town there is , if you want the truth and that 's a fact . HELEN BROWN It was nice , though , Tampa , in the olden times , while they lasted . Like every Saturday night , the Blue Mill . Dancing and all that . Contests , sometimes . We hardly ever did n't win something , Steve and me . That 's how he got the idea regarding the Harvest Moon Ball , you know , the dancing contest . Honest , when we started out in the Madison Square Garden I could n't hardly believe it . It was mostly Steve , the way he promoted . And do n't think I did n't enjoy it because I did enjoy it  --  only of course I never had any confidence . The first night down there  --  that was the first time he started getting sore at me down there . He started hollering you got to have confidence  --  that 's half of the battle . Confidence . So I tried  --  but I do n't know . He was much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAC I 'd have voted for you , Helen . HELEN BROWN Thanks . ( He finishes his Popsicle , looks at the stick ) MAC They 're making ' em better all the time , do n't you think that ? ( He drops the stick into a wastebasket pasted with magazine covers ) HELEN BROWN ( Absently ) What ? ( She looks down at the stick in her hand ) p. 17 MAC You 'd of enjoyed it if you 'd of known you were having it . HELEN BROWN Yeah . MAC If I was a doctor I would send you to the Polyclinic and have your head twisted back in shape from backwards to frontwards . HELEN BROWN ( She drops her stick into the wastepaper basket ) It 's like smoking . The doctor says to me , cut down on your smoking . I said to him  --  how can I  --  ? I do n't ever know when I 'm doing it ! ( MAC rises ) MAC Mrs. Brown , I invite you down to Rocco 's for a beer . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your heart desires up to sixty cents . HELEN BROWN No , thank you . MAC Come on . HELEN BROWN It 's about dinner time . MAC That 's what I say . Couple of drinks . Worst thing anybody can do is eat on an empty stomach . HELEN BROWN No , thanks , just the same . MAC I was hoping to continue this important conference . HELEN BROWN What about ? MAC About your future . p. 18 HELEN BROWN I 've had my future , thanks . MAC You got one of the two worst diseases there is . Living in the past . HELEN BROWN Yeah ? What 's the other one ? MAC  --  in the future . HELEN BROWN Must be nice to know it all . MAC Nowhere near . Seventy-six years I been trying to learn how to live . That 's a gyp , ai n't it ? HELEN BROWN Sure is . MAC Come on down . HELEN BROWN No . MAC So we wo n't talk . We 'll have a soft drink and put a quarter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't seem to realize it plays six records for a quarter . Or the same one six times . That 's what I usually do  --  I got one I been patronizing all this week . " La Vie En Rose . " A French song they claim it is . A girl singing full of heart and very refreshing . This hour it 's quiet around Rocco 's . Also , a friendly atmosphere . People got to get out of their four walls every once and a while . Face it . You got to rub up against other people . Even around farms and in the rural areas  --  once and a while , they meet in a village or a meeting house or a church . It 's necessary . p. 19 HELEN BROWN I tell you the truth . I 'm waiting a call . MAC Okay . I do n't believe it , but okay . I better get down there myself , though . ( He starts out ) If I stay away too long they think I been run over . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands perfectly still for what seems a long time . Now she turns from the door , lights a cigarette , and stands looking out of the window , a lonely figure . From the street comes the familiar cry " I cashclothes ! I cashclothes ! I cashclothes ! " The lights fade and the walls enclose HELEN 's room . Simultaneously , lights come up on SODA 'S window . There she sits , surveying the passing world and sipping her soda ) SODA I says to her , after all , you got abide by the law the same as everybody . So she opens up her big mouth to me and she says I do n't care for you or the law , she says . I mean what can you do with a person of such kind of character ? She 's just a cheap thing . Very big for her boots , what 's more . ( She sips ) Imagine the nerve of her to open up her big mouth to me , that little bum up there ! ( She tosses her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I know for a fact  --  she 's not long for this place . If she would n't pay attention to the lawyer letter  --  I am not joking  --  I take an oath I 'll report her  --  if not to the New York Telephone then to the Forty-Seventh Street Station House . I could have reported her already long ago , only it 's like this . In the first place  --  I do n't want to make her or nobody any trouble . There are people by nature mean-spirited . I 'm not by nature mean-spirited . in the second place  --  it would go in the paper with the address and all the rest of it and right away you got a bad name and all the rest of it . And in the second place , who wants them snooping around  --  what 's it their business ? I mean what my tenants do in their apartments is their own damn business . Excuse me . ( She sips away , contentedly . The lights warm on MAC at the apposite side of the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAC I 'm a damn fool . SODA Another fellow . On the second floor in the back ? Some kind of music writer . What do I care ? Let him . MAC What would you do if you were you , she says ? Well I better admit she had me there . In seventy-six years of living  --  the things I 've learned  --  you would n't believe it  --  I do n't believe it myself . And with all that  --  I still do n't know how to live . I can run a typewriter  --  one time in Connecticut  --  I built myself a house . I speak a little Portugee  --  " Ola , amigos , como vao ? Como veem , falo um pouco de Portugues . Nao muito bem , mas o suficiente ! " I do n't know why  --  one time I wanted to better myself . But with all the things  --  the main thing I 'm still trying to learn . How to live . How in the hell to live in the world . What to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . Benjamin Franklin , now there was a man . I remove my hat in his memory . ( He does so ) Used to wake up and spend the first hour of his day figuring out how to use the rest of it . It worked fine . He accomplished . Made the most of . Enjoyed . Not like most of the rest of us . SODA And the way she sucks up to that old fool that McGreevy . When she did n't live here yet , he used to be a plain quiet old man . And if she did n't hear about his insurance policy believe me she would never started in . Who told her God knows  --  but from that minute she started putting on double perfumery and like an old fool  --  he sniffs . And who knows what else ? Hot pants  --  that 's bad enough  --  but old hot pants  --  is disgusting is the only word for it . ( Offstage a loud bell ) Excuse me , it 's my ringing . ( She leaves the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nelghborhood here about that I own a one hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy . How it sprung up , that I do n't know . Of course , one time I did go and swipe a piece of stationery from the Prudential people  --  and I typewrote up a letter to myself saying that on such and such a date a premium would be due on my one hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy and I put on a three-cent stamp and I mailed it to myself and I did n't lick the envelope very wet so when it come it come loose . Maybe this is how the story sprung up  --  I do n't know . Possibly . ( He leaves as the lights on him fade . Simultaneously , the walls disappear and the lights come on in HELEN 'S room . It is unoccupied . A sound of a key in the lock brings HELEN into the room from the alcove just as SODA kicks open the door and bounds into the room ) HELEN BROWN ( Startled ) What the hell  --  ? SODA Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BROWN Good thing I had on six locks while I lived here . SODA ( Out to the hall ) Come on , come on ! ( A young man comes in , slowly , feeling strange . Whatever he looks like underneath will have to await discovery . Just now he is covered with the patina of a summer mover 's grime and fatigue . He wears a straw hat , a crumpled seersucker , a bow tie , and carries two bags , one oddly shaped . His name is GUS HAMMER ) This is it . Okay ? p. 22 GUS HAMMER Well  --  SODA And your friend is just down one . GUS HAMMER Yuh . SODA Only this is a much valuabler room . ( GUS looks at it , and at HELEN standing there ) You got to excuse the appearance at present .

She looks at GUS , points to HELEN ) She 's moving out . ( She looks at HELEN , points to GUS ) He 's moving in . ( To them both ) That 's all . Arrange it among you . ( She whirls her hands in illustration ) p. 23 HELEN BROWN Two people you said . SODA ( Caught ) What ? HELEN BROWN He your idea of two people ? SODA ( Improvising ) Another one 's coming .

HELEN drags a trunk in from the alcove and begins to pack . From above , the sound of a racking , hacking cough . GUS looks up through the ceiling . The cough continues , then stops , spent ) GUS HAMMER ( Ill-at-ease ) Some woman ! HELEN BROWN Who ? ( GUS indicates SODA . HELEN looks at him , sees nothing , goes back to the alcove . GUS moves around the room , feeling half in , half out . He had been looking forward to a closed door and a few minutes of privacy . He looks out of the window . A game of Ring-a-levio is in noisy progress in the street . He puts down his hat and goes out . A moment later , he returns , carrying two more oddly shaped cases . Another trip , and he brings in three or four packages and props . He puts everything as nearly out of the way as possible . HELEN comes back in and continues her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is okay .

GUS HAMMER In what way ? HELEN BROWN Besides being a saxophone player . GUS HAMMER Well , Gus Hammer . That 's my name . HELEN BROWN You come in by bus ? GUS HAMMER Yes . Why ? HELEN BROWN Nothing . I just wanted to see if I could guess it right . ( She is having trouble with the top of her trunk ) GUS HAMMER  --  use some beef there ? p. 27 HELEN BROWN What ? GUS HAMMER Close that ?

As it comes out , the flannel slips off , revealing a large , ornate , silver cup , somewhat tarnished . HELEN re-wraps it , speedily , as she takes it out to the alcove . GUS replaces the lid and closes the trunk . HELEN comes back ) Three and a half weeks . Well well well . GUS HAMMER ( Pointing to the trunk ) Closed now . HELEN BROWN Thanks . How do you like it ?

GUS HAMMER Well , I do n't know  --  HELEN BROWN Do n't you need it for your business and all like that ? GUS HAMMER ( Looking at the phone ) What are they gettin ' for those now ? ( BO , a little bald man , comes running in , followed a moment later by EDIE . Both are in cotton bathrobes and slippers . They have the unmistakable masks of mimes . Ten thousand applications of grease paint have left a larger-than-life mark . They seem ready to go on  --  if only someone will point out the stage ) BO KERRY ( As he crosses to the phone ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know you had company , I 'd of worn my pants . ( Into the phone ) Hello ! How 'd we come out , Mike ? Oh . Out , huh ? Who made it ? Yeah . Yeah , good act . Yeah . No , just those two next week  --  no , one is a smoker and the other one a kiddie party ( He laughs )  --  be all right if we do n't get our routines mixed , huh ? Who ? Yeah , what 'd he have to say ? ( He is angry ) Listen , he 's got brains and so has a cat . How the hell does he know so much ? For all anybody knows the mindreading turn may be the biggest thing they 've had on the television yet ! Yeah , well how much would he have give for Charlie McCarthy and his dummy on the radio ? Who 'd a thought that ? p. 31 EDIE KERRY Edgar Bergen , you mean . BO KERRY ( To EDIE ) What ? ( On the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? EDIE KERRY Nothing , not important . BO KERRY What ? EDIE KERRY Charlie McCarthy 's the dummy 's name . BO KERRY What about it ? EDIE KERRY Nothing , only you said  --  BO KERRY Look , Edie , do you mind to let me finish here with Mike ? ( On the phone ) Hello , Mike ? Nothing . Edie . She talks . Well , do n't forget us , Mike . I hate this walkin ' around with empty pockets . No , it 's not that . It 's just I 'd feel so foolish in case I got held up ! ( He laughs at his joke ) Yeah . Goodbye , kid . ( He hangs up and turns to GUS ) Sorry to have butten in . HELEN BROWN This is Edie and Bo Kerry  --  meet Gus Something . GUS HAMMER Hammer . BO KERRY ( Offering his hand ) Pleased to meet you . p. 32 EDIE KERRY Likewise . HELEN BROWN A new member . BO KERRY Oh ? Nice . EDIE KERRY ( Looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's noisy enough around here without any new blowers . GUS HAMMER No more than necessary , I assure you .

EDIE KERRY But when did  --  ? HELEN BROWN Later . BO KERRY I wish somebody 'd come and bail us out . ( He laughs ) Or we could get time off for good behavior !

BO KERRY If you been around you might of caught us  --  we 're known as Princess Edith and Company . We been a standard for years . We used to go by Kerry and Cash . Catch on ? p. 33 EDIE KERRY He never saw us . He 's too young . GUS HAMMER Maybe I did . BO KERRY Do n't say maybe  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember it . Martin Beck himself he used to come in our dressing room and kid with us , watch us practice , everything . EDIE KERRY That was a long time ago .

( He goes ) p. 34 HELEN BROWN Used to be big shots , would you believe it ? The funny thing they tell all kinds of fantastics  --  especially Bo  --  then , later you find out how it 's true . GUS HAMMER They looked okay . HELEN BROWN What hands me one is I look at them  --  they been there and back  --  and here 's you  --  set on gettin ' there . And all of you in the same place . GUS HAMMER You got me wrong . I do n't want to set any world on fire tomorrow morning  --  what the hell  --  I just want a job with a chance for advancement  --  take lessons  --  improve myself  --  try and get better and better . What 's wrong with my name it ca n't be up over the Paramount ? HELEN BROWN Search me . ( A silence . HELEN packs . In the stillness the pounding piano from below is heard playing a single four-bar phrase over and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arlen 's " The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea . " GUS listens , and smiles in recognition ) GUS HAMMER Ralph . HELEN BROWN Who ? GUS HAMMER That 's my friend . How I got in here . ( He bangs a signal on the floor with his fist . RALPH echoes it in music ) He 's an arranger ? Yuh . That 's a sock brass chorus he 's doing right now for Woody Herman . He 's good all right , Ralph . We 're from the same home town  --  we did n't even know each other there  --  but here we meet . How 's that ? p. 35 HELEN BROWN Where you from ? ( No reply ) Do n't you know ? GUS HAMMER Sure I know . HELEN BROWN Well  --  GUS HAMMER Nothing . I was just told not to discuss it too much . HELEN BROWN What is it to hide ? GUS HAMMER Nothing . Nothing to hide . I was just advised , that 's all . HELEN BROWN By your lawyer ? GUS HAMMER No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A fugitive from a chain-gang ? ( A pause ) GUS HAMMER Minneapolis . HELEN BROWN Well , that 's nothing to be ashamed of . I mean , no more than St. Paul . GUS HAMMER ( Brightening ) You been up there ? HELEN BROWN Not for long . I just passed through it on a tour . GUS HAMMER Oh . ( Another pause ) HELEN BROWN Do n't you want to know what kind of tour ? GUS HAMMER Yes , sure . ( A moment ) What kind of tour ? p. 36 HELEN BROWN Dancing contest winners . ( He is looking at her . HELEN snorts a little laugh ) I just wanted to see how surprised you 'd show . That was the cup you saw before . GUS HAMMER What 's there to be surprised ? HELEN BROWN ( A hoity-toity tone ) Oh , thank you , Sir Walter Raleigh . GUS HAMMER ( Mifled ) What 's all this ? HELEN BROWN You think I never look at myself or what ? GUS HAMMER No . HELEN BROWN ( Sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell do I care ? It never done me any good . Trouble , in fact . You want some good advice ? I 'll give it to you free . Never win a dancing contest . GUS HAMMER Okay . HELEN BROWN Miss Rhumba , 1946 . That 's me . GUS HAMMER That 's interesting . HELEN BROWN Why ? GUS HAMMER I do n't know . People you meet . You still in the same business ? HELEN BROWN Only in a way . Tango Gardens . p. 37 GUS HAMMER I 've heard of that , yuh . HELEN BROWN I 'm off tonight . Summer 's slow . Everybody 's off . Three out of seven . GUS HAMMER Slow for me , too . HELEN BROWN You ever been in Tampa ? GUS HAMMER Florida ? HELEN BROWN Yes . GUS HAMMER No , I do n't think so . ( The phone rings . HELEN gets it this time ) HELEN BROWN My home town . GUS HAMMER That where you 're heading ? HELEN BROWN ( On the phone ) Yes ? Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong number  --  what ? yes , that 's right  --  but there 's no Peggy here sure I 'm sure ( She hangs up , and in an effort to seem casual , her voice is little more than a whisper ) What were you saying ? GUS HAMMER Nothing . Just about Tampa . HELEN BROWN Oh , yes . ( Suddenly , she is in tears . She tries to get out of the room  --  out of this stranger 's sight , ca n't make it  --  sinks to the trunk and sits there weeping . GUS is stunned  --  he waits . Then he goes to one of his bags  --  opens it , and gets out a bottle of whiskey . Seagram 's , A Blend . He pours some into a glass and takes it to her ) p. 38 GUS HAMMER Here . ( She shakes her head ) You better have a shot . Come on . ( She shakes her head again . GUS downs the drink ) HELEN BROWN ( A soft wail ) No place , no place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know what I 'm doing . No place ! What am I packing ? GUS HAMMER Sure you have . HELEN BROWN Do n't tell me ! GUS HAMMER Right here , lady . You can stay right the hell where you are . ( All this display of emotion has unnerved him and he is driven to anger ) I 'll brain that old woman  --  what she trying to make out of me , anyhow ? HELEN BROWN It 's not you , fella . There 's no use . If she do n't pester me out today so she 'll pester me out tomorrow . GUS HAMMER What does she want ? HELEN BROWN Same as everybody . More dough . GUS HAMMER All right , then , look . It 's an emergency . You pay her yours I 'll pay her mine . We can both use the dump and this 'll satisfy her , wo n't it ? She 'll be collecting double . What the hell more could she want ? p. 39 HELEN BROWN I do n't think so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think so . GUS HAMMER Matter of a few days . HELEN BROWN Just the same . GUS HAMMER Listen , it 's nothing to me . I wo n't even know you 're here . I got to be out and around anyway . HELEN BROWN ( Looking through the floor ) Your friend down there got an extra bunk ? GUS HAMMER Only it 's used . That 's why he got me this . HELEN BROWN Anyways , I 'm broke . GUS HAMMER Glad to lend you . HELEN BROWN Why ? Why should you ? GUS HAMMER I do n't know . People loaned me . HELEN BROWN Yeah , well . What 's the use ? She would n't go for it . GUS HAMMER How do you know ? HELEN BROWN She would n't . GUS HAMMER Let me go talk  --  see what I can do . HELEN BROWN It 's no use , I tell you . ( GUS starts out , she makes no move to prevent him . He leaves . HELEN , alone , takes a drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return . Lights come up on MAC in his booth . He is sitting there now , with his three beers , the third one almost gone . In the background , the voice of Edith Piaf , singing her heart out . " La Vie en Rose . " MAC surveys the audience , and makes a serious inquiry ) p. 40 MAC Anybody here interested in living to old age ? Because if there is . I have found out a few things . I say this : if you want to live old  --  study the habits of the elderly and the aged . ( He pauses to let this sink in ) This is what I did before I became one . I used to go out to old folks ' homes and study ' em . These ones who made it past eighty or ninety , even , some . And I learned a lot in this manner . Now you may think that is funny and yet I have been up to the Bronx Zoo on a Sunday and you could n't get near to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't deny this is an interesting and even you might say educational pastime  --  but it just does not compare with studying the human being , especially the elderly and the aged . ( He warms to his subject ) Now , what 's the first thing you notice ? Right ! How they all take it easy all the time . How they are either resting , or about to rest or else they just rested . And everything they do , they do it slowly or on the slow side . Walk , or eat , or rock , or whatever . Now , I do not claim to read minds  --  like Edie or Bo  --  but I can feel what you are thinking . You are thinking , " that old fool up there he does n't realize that naturally they move slow because they are old ! " Well . I have considered that . And I have come to this conclusion , ladies and gentlemen . They do n't move slow because they are old , ladies and gentlemen  --  they are old because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this can be argued both ways  --  but I claim to have spent more time on this particular subject than anybody here . And that is the conclusion to which I have come . That 's all . ( The lighting effect takes us away from MAC and to SODA , leaning on her sill and in possession of a bottle of pop . It 's green , this time . She talks to us ) p. 41 SODA So ? So we naturally made the deal . With him I made it , the horn blower  --  I would n't spit on her if she asked me . One thing I got to admit , God forgive me I should say good on her  --  that tramp  --  but I got to hand her , she is some fast worker . A guy walks in  --  one , two , three ! They are partners , if you know what I mean . Of course he is no bargain , but who is she to be picky and choosy ? Margaret Truman ? ( She is sucking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her band back to the middle section , HELEN and GUS . The day bed is made up for the night now . GUS is in pajamas , robe and soled woolen socks . He rummages about in his suitcase , takes out a few articles and shoves it under the day bed . One of them is a picture of three people in a standup frame . He puts it on a little shelf near the bed . He opens a leather case , and examines the contents . HELEN is in a robe , too . She has been watching a Silex coffee maker . A tall glass , filled with ice , stands ready on the table . GUS looks down into the street , then turns back into the room and laughs ) HELEN BROWN What 's funny ? GUS HAMMER Nothing . HELEN BROWN Something down there in the street ? GUS HAMMER No . Up in here . p. 42 HELEN BROWN Like what ? GUS HAMMER Well , you were saying about New York  --  about not friendly ? Well a thing like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each other for a moment ) HELEN BROWN It has n't happened here yet . ( She turns her attention to the coffee pot ) GUS HAMMER Anyways I never heard of it . HELEN BROWN That proves nothing . GUS HAMMER No I guess not . ( He picks up his electric razor ) A.C. or D.C. in here ? HELEN BROWN A.C. I think , is n't it ? GUS HAMMER I do n't know . HELEN BROWN Why , what 's the difference ? GUS HAMMER This here electric razor . I like to use it if it 's A.C. in here . HELEN BROWN I think so . GUS HAMMER Yeah . My father gave me that . Very nice of him . HELEN BROWN You said it . Considering when I left home , the second time that was , my old man gave me an A.C. kick in the slats . ( She pours coffee into the ice ) You want this ? Here . p. 43 GUS HAMMER ( Coming over ) Thanks . This is great . HELEN BROWN You 're the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awake . GUS HAMMER Makes me sleep , that 's a fact . HELEN BROWN I do n't understand it . Every damn magazine you read says . ( She prepares his bed . He drinks ) GUS HAMMER This is great . HELEN BROWN Oh , sure , I 'm full of talent . Remember me , Miss Rhumba , 1946 ? ( She proves it with a skilful little demonstration ) GUS HAMMER I sure do . Miss Rhumba from Tampa . ( He smiles , brightly ) Song title ! HELEN BROWN At least I 'm not ashamed of it . Tampa . GUS HAMMER Why should you ? HELEN BROWN You 're ashamed of Milwaukee . GUS HAMMER Minneapolis . No , I 'm not . HELEN BROWN Sure you are . You were worried to tell it . GUS HAMMER Well , that 's a professional reason . See , in this business  --  I mean it 's a question of style and so on . p. 44 HELEN BROWN So . GUS HAMMER Well , I understand the feeling is if you 're from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , that 's where the expression comes from . HELEN BROWN What expression ? GUS HAMMER Corny . Cornfed is what they mean . Shortened . A guy from the Midwest is supposed to be a hick  --  cornfed  --  you know  --  not up to date  --  not hep  --  so they call his style corny . HELEN BROWN Every day you learn something . Do you think you 're corny ? GUS HAMMER ( Flashing ) I know damn well I 'm not . Listen , I 've heard some of these New Yorkers . Hell ! They 're out of tune , for God 's sake ! Then they steal a little Goodman riff or an old T. Dorsey , and they think they 're in there . HELEN BROWN What are you hollering at me for ? GUS HAMMER Nothing . I 'm not asking any favors , just a chance , that 's all . HELEN BROWN You 'll get it , you 'll get it . GUS HAMMER Damn right . Why should they be prejudiced ? HELEN BROWN Who 's they ? GUS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The same ones they 've always been . p. 45 HELEN BROWN Everybody 's always worrying about " they . " They ought a do this  --  why do n't they have that ? They think  --  they know  --  who 's they ? GUS HAMMER I do n't know . I never thought about it . No  --  it 's just this friend I know  --  downstairs  --  he tells me not to mention Minneapolis . He says I should say I come from like Trenton or Flushing or like that . HELEN BROWN ( With mock understanding ) Oh , that 's not corny . GUS HAMMER That 's what he tells me to say . Ralph . But hell , I played a club date with a pick-up combination last Saturday night  --  twelve men  --  stock arrangements . Over the River  --  I mean we went under in a train  --  Newark City ? HELEN BROWN Jersey City . GUS HAMMER That 's it . Jersey City . Talk about corny . They were corny and they did n't know it  --  that 's worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bunk . She looks in to see if it has any ) HELEN BROWN Cigarettes in here  --  you 're welcome . GUS HAMMER Thanks  --  only I never use ' em . I used to . No more . Gave it up . p. 46 HELEN BROWN You 're some guy . GUS HAMMER How do you mean ? HELEN BROWN Unusual . GUS HAMMER Everybody 's unusual , have n't you ever noticed that ? ( HELEN lights a cigarette ) HELEN BROWN Since when do n't you smoke ? GUS HAMMER Part of business . Better not to , breathing a horn . HELEN BROWN You drink ? GUS HAMMER Practically not . HELEN BROWN My goodness . ( A little pause ) GUS HAMMER Yes to the next question . HELEN BROWN What ? ( He smiles , surprised at the joke which has popped out of him . It rarely happens  --  he is shy but delighted ) Oh . ( She is cleaning the table ) You were a nice kid till you got fresh . GUS HAMMER Just a joke . HELEN BROWN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked it up already . GUS HAMMER What ? HELEN BROWN Flip talk . ( She starts out . GUS intercepts her ) p. 47 GUS HAMMER I beg your pardon , Miss . Call it a slip of the tongue . HELEN BROWN Mrs. GUS HAMMER Mrs. HELEN BROWN Okay . GUS . Please . HELEN BROWN ( Nervously ) Okay , okay . I said okay , did n't I ? What do you want ? GUS HAMMER ( He steps aside ) Nothing  --  I  --  ( She stands still , then speaks softer ) HELEN BROWN Okay . I do n't know what 's got me so high-horsey all of a sudden . I 'm a little upset , that 's all . Still and all  --  it 's very nice of you to apologize . GUS HAMMER I do apologize . HELEN BROWN Okay . Good night . GUS HAMMER Good night . ( She moves into the alcove and draws the curtain . He looks at it for a moment , then goes to the day bed , takes off his robe , goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's piano and the trumpet practicer swell into the room . GUS stands facing the open window . He removes his pajama top and begins his deep breathing exercises  --  a slow breath in on ten counts as he raises his arms slowly above his head  --  hold for ten  --  out in ten . Then he empties his lungs in a series of sharp exhalations . The middle of his third trip is interrupted by a soft rapping on the door . He stops , turns and looks to it . Another rap . He starts for the door  --  HELEN comes out , quickly , putting on her robe . They almost collide . HELEN , startled by the state of his undress pops back into her alcove . GUS hustles into his robe . HELEN appears again and motions him to be quiet . He nods in understanding . She pantomimes  --  " They 'll go away . " He asks without words , " Who can it be ? " She tries , " Someone for you ? " He replies with a definite " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time it is harder and it continues steadily for a long stretch .

She is horrified ) Right on time , baby . Never been late in my life . ( He has the giggles and they stay with him throughout the following scene . He sits down and removes a shoe ) GUS HAMMER What is this ? ( TELEPHONE MAN looks up and sees Gus . Shakes his head hard , looks again ) TELEPHONE MAN ( Sizing up what he thinks is the situation ) Oh , oh ! ( He removes his hat , puts it over his face ) ' Scuse me deeply . ' Scuse me . ( Hat over face , he starts out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , sidles up and speaks behind his hand ) How long you figure to be , pal ? GUS HAMMER You 're in the wrong place , mister . ( He begins to lead him out of the room ) TELEPHONE MAN ( As he stumbles backward ) Watch that pushin ' , Buster ! ( To HELEN in alcove ) What time you want me back ? p. 49 GUS HAMMER No , no . HELEN BROWN Get out ! TELEPHONE MAN Do n't ' No , no ' me , Buster . I 've had one or two but I know what side I 'm buttered on , see  --  so do n't butter me . GUS HAMMER Why do n't you be a good fellow now and  --  ? TELEPHONE MAN ( Outraged ) I 'm a good fellow now  --  what the hell ! I 'm just standin ' in line quietly and waitin ' my li'l ol ' turn ! ( Suiting the action to the word , he queues up behind GUS , who is standing by alcove . He removes his hat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to lead the interloper out ) GUS HAMMER It 's a mistake . TELEPHONE MAN Listen , I know where I 'm at  --  Bryant 9-8040  --  that 's this place , so what the hell ! ( He is trying to light a cigarette without success . He looks up with a silly leer ) I want my pound of flesh , know what I mean ? ( This breaks him up ) GUS HAMMER Okay , fella  --  ( He starts to propel him out once more . TELEPHONE MAN loses his temper . He flings cigarette and match to the floor ) p. 50 TELEPHONE MAN I told you to watch that pushin ' ! ( GUS persists , TELEPHONE MAN lashes out and sends him reeling with a wild punch . GUS stumbles backward across the room , trips over a chair , knocks over a lamp , holding his mouth with one hand , breaking the fall with the other ) Didden I ?

He gives his head a few shakes . He starts to stand ) HELEN BROWN ( To TELEPHONE MAN ) C'mere a second . Do n't make trouble . p. 51 TELEPHONE MAN ( Aping her tone ) Not me , honey . No trouble . ( She leads him out into the hall and closes door . GUS stands up . His lip is bleeding . He goes to basin and dashes cold water on his face . A little time passes . HELEN comes back . She stands near the screen ) HELEN BROWN You all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You hurt ? GUS HAMMER No . ( A pause ) HELEN BROWN I could call a doctor . Or else I got a first aid kit . GUS HAMMER I 'm okay . ( They are both glad to have the screen between them ) HELEN BROWN I 'm sorry . GUS HAMMER What about ? HELEN BROWN Everything . GUS HAMMER Forget it . ( He comes out , walks to window , partly closes it ) HELEN BROWN Just one of those things . A mistake . ( GUS starts back , but stops . They look at each other , then he goes to the phone , turns it to read the number , looks close to make sure . Bryant 9-8040 is what he sees . He looks up at HELEN . They exchange a long cold look ) p. 52 GUS HAMMER Was it ? ( HELEN is about to speak , resigns with a shrug and goes into the alcove . GUS turns out all lights except the lamp near his bed . A strong light from the alcove filters into the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her mouth . She takes a match from the table , lights her cigarette . Across the alley somewhere , a lonely trumpet is singing diminished seventh chords in slow triplets . The strains are modern and melancholy ) HELEN BROWN Listen , do n't be sore at me . It 's my fault  --  but not all  --  what the hell  --  we all start out to be society ladies and president of a bank or the United States and we wind up saxophone players or like me . What the hell . GUS HAMMER ( An impatient whisper ) Okay okay okay . ( She goes back . From the alcove smoke wafts into the room . RALPH 'S piano stops , leaving only the solitary trumpet . Then it , too , stops . All is still . GUS leans out of bed , takes a cigarette from HELEN 'S box , lights it , and sits up to smoke . He turns the lamp out . He is seen now only by the undulating light of his cigarette . The alcove lights go , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curtain . There is SODA in her accustomed position . She is sipping from a bottle . Yellow . SODA It 's a week and a half already  --  you think she 's gone yet ? What do you think ? I 'll give you three guesses and a genuine Western Electric Washomat . Like f-u-n . Furthermore , if I ever seen anybody getting no place fast , that 's her . He 's no greenhorn that guy  --  he comes from where the greenhorns come from , but he ai n't one . He 's got a mind on other things which are more important than anything she 's got to offer . This is a fellow who is going to get there if not bust . So believe me  --  much as she wags her tail  --  he do n't even see it because his eyes are full of notes . All kinds of notes . ( Her eye catches the parched tomato plant which stands on the sill beside her . She gives it a drink of soda water , then continues ) That Princess Edith without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoop she says : ( She mimics archly ) I notice you found us another hornblower for God 's sake . You must be queer for noise she says . So I ignore her . So then she gives again she says ca n't you find any normal tenants ? I said to her : listen Missus  --  in the first place  --  mind your business which could use some minding  --  and in the third place , I said  --  if you have to know  --  musicians , especially saxophone , will always pay a better rate gladly so if you do n't like it give me back your space and I 'll do better with it with some musician who ca n't get in every place . So she closed her big water closet and that 's all . I said to her  --  just be damn glad he ai n't a trombone or drum , thank your lucky . Everybody 's got something to say . In New York anyway a person learns to not hear . Automatic . If everybody listened to everything around in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now on the center section and the walls away . GUS is working on a chorus of " Japanese Sandman . " He stands , facing the piano on which he has arranged a music rack . He is concentrated on the creation of sound patterns and oblivious to his surroundings . Then , an error . He stops  --  goes back six or seven bars and runs into the sticky place again . Better . He plays it again . Again . Again . Again . Now he goes on . HELEN comes in wearing what she works in at Tango Gardens . As she does , SODA is withdrawn by fading light . GUS twists around at the sound of the door . He sees HELEN come in and sort of greets her with a nod  --  without interrupting his playing . She goes to the alcove and we see her change her shoes . She has brought home a bag of grapes , and during the following , washes them and puts them in a bowl on the table . GUS comes to the end of the chorus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs to the highest , holds it , slap-tongues his lowest once again and takes the mouthpiece from his lips . He unhooks the horn from his neckstrap , and places it on the stand before him . He caps the mouthpiece and works his fingers out of their cramp . He mops his face with a handkerchief ) p. 54 GUS HAMMER Anything new with you ? HELEN BROWN Not a thing . GUS HAMMER How 's it going up at the old Tango Gardens ? HELEN BROWN Slow . GUS HAMMER Could they use a **27;3418;TOOLONG alto man up there ? HELEN BROWN Still nothing , huh ? GUS HAMMER Oh  --  call for you . Somebody like  --  could it be  --  Avis ? She says you know the number . HELEN BROWN ( Quietly ) Okay . Not important . GUS HAMMER Say , I do n't want to get too  --  Still , lemme ask you . Is your name Peggy , too ? HELEN BROWN No . Just a sort of a nickname . GUS HAMMER Oh . HELEN BROWN Do n't you ever say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Brown 's good enough for me , Helen . ( A little pause ) HELEN BROWN Anything new with you ? GUS HAMMER Well , maybe . You ever happen to hear of Frankie Jay and his Red Peppers ? p. 55 HELEN BROWN A band ? GUS HAMMER Yuh . HELEN BROWN No . GUS HAMMER Me neither , but they 're supposed to be very well known in bop . HELEN BROWN They must be . GUS HAMMER I 've got this audition set up with them . I think my full rack helped out . Wanted to know did I have a baritone-clarinet  --  flute  --  everything . They play a lot of trick stuff  --  so they can use different instrumentation , see ? ( He looks at his stand ) I better doll these up before . Sometimes the looks of it HELEN BROWN When is all this ? GUS HAMMER Tomorrow . Right here . He 's bringing his sax section over . They do n't want to do it where they work on account of the man they 're replacing  --  so  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ought to straighten up and clean around . ( Phone rings . HELEN picks it up and continues talking to Gus ) Better if you do n't look too desperate circumstances . GUS HAMMER Oh I do n't think it  --  HELEN BROWN ( On phone ) Yeah ? Oh , hello Avis . Uh-huh . ( GUS is untying the strings of a box he has brought out from under his bed ) Well , thanks , but I ca n't make it . No I 'm sorry . So long . ( She hangs up ) p. 56 GUS HAMMER Mrs. Brown ? HELEN BROWN ( Absently ) Yeah ? ( A moment passes ) What ? GUS HAMMER You want to see something ? HELEN BROWN Hell , no , I 've seen enough . ( The trumpet-playing neighbor begins to see what he can do with a chorus of Gershwin 's " Embraceable You . " GUS takes out a huge , orangecolored fox pelt and displays it as though it were an infant ) GUS HAMMER ( Triumphantly ) Look ! HELEN BROWN What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it ) How can you tell ? GUS HAMMER ( Bringing it over ) No kiddin ' , pure fur  --  look at this . HELEN BROWN ( Wiping the back of her neck ) You sure picked the right day for fur . GUS HAMMER No , I 'm going to keep it till December . HELEN BROWN If it lasts . GUS HAMMER For my aunt 's birthday . December tenth . I do n't know if she ever had a fur piece . p. 57 HELEN BROWN Or is ever gon na . GUS HAMMER To tell you the truth it surprised me , too  --  but this was just dumb luck . ( He moves closer to her , drops his voice , and fondling the piece in his hands  --  tells ) I 'm coming along the Avenue of the Americas there , about around Fortieth Street or like that and there 's a little whistle  --  I mean like a man whistling  --  so I look around  --  and there 's another few people look around naturally , but this fellow sitting in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he asks me can I use a fox fur piece  --  well , I had to laugh . But then he tells me the spot . He and this other fellow , the driver ? , they 're on their way back to Saks Fifth Avenue where they work  --  and they notice there 's a mistake and they been given this extra fur piece by mistake . Well , they talk it over and they decide to sell it because this other fellow the driver 's kid is sick . And would you believe it  --  they tried for nearly an hour , the fellow told me , and no takers . He says there 's so damn many rackets going around town that nobody believed this was on the level  --  he told me a fellow once stood around Broadway and Forty-second Street there and tried to sell ten-dollar bills for a dollar apiece and he could n't sell one , because that 's how people have become . HELEN BROWN He would n't be down there now , would he ? p. 58 GUS HAMMER So then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smoke imagine if I could ever latch onto a thing like that for my aunt 's birthday  --  but I said to this fellow  --  you got to pick somebody else because all I 've got on me is about twenty dollars  --  so he and this other fellow  --  the driver ? , they laughed and the first fellow said two hundred would be highway robbery . So I started off and the fellow looked at his watch and he said listen we got to move take it for nothing  --  take it for the twenty  --  we do n't care . So here it is . ( A long pause . The Trumpet Player starts work on the melodic verse HELEN BROWN ( There are tears in her eyes ) God damn this town and everybody in it ! ( She gets up and moves away ) GUS HAMMER Why ? This no good ? HELEN BROWN Listen , friend  --  one thing there ai n't enough around of is truth  --  so have some : Two dollars it 's worth if not less . GUS HAMMER Pure fur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy would n't give you four bits . GUS HAMMER ( Low ) Well . You do n't know everything . p. 59 HELEN BROWN Not only not everything , boy , not nothing . GUS HAMMER Then why throw cold water ? ( He puts fur away , angrily ) HELEN BROWN You said my advice , did n't you ? GUS HAMMER Okay okay . HELEN BROWN Like everybody  --  they do n't want advice they want you to tell ' em what they want to hear , that 's all . GUS HAMMER Thanks very much . HELEN BROWN What 's it to me if  --  ( A knock on the door . HELEN opens it . It is BO , wearing a remarkably effective toupee , and EDIE ) BO KERRY Any calls ? Messages ? Money orders ? HELEN BROWN ( To GUS ) Ask her ! BO KERRY What ? HELEN BROWN Go ahead , ask her ! EDIE KERRY Ask me what ? GUS HAMMER Nothing . HELEN BROWN Something , not nothing . Go ahead , now  --  you think I 'm against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets out the fur again . He hands it to EDIE ) p. 60 GUS HAMMER All right  --  your opinion  --  what 's this worth ? ( EDIT examines the fur with great care . She takes it to the window for better light , blows on it , shakes it , strokes it , smells it ) EDIE KERRY Worth zero . ( As she hands it back to him she holds on to the tail a beat too long , with the result that it comes off in her hand . GUS dives for it , worried ) GUS HAMMER ( Weakly ) Not even something ? ( The trumpet stops ) EDIE KERRY Why , it 's like one of them things those guys use in the truck racket . GUS HAMMER ( Startled ) What ? EDIE KERRY Where they make out to be delivery guys with an extra bundle and grab off some sucker walking by ? ( GUS is putting the fur piece away , he glances up to see a triumphant HELEN moving into the alcove ) GUS HAMMER ( Stubbornly ) Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BO KERRY Listen , buddy , we use your phone do n't give you any excuse to insult my wife . Besides you got paid ! p. 61 GUS HAMMER I did n't insult anybody 's  --  BO KERRY ( Interrupting sharply ) All right  --  just do n't open up ! My wife 's owned more damn fur than you ever seen ! GUS HAMMER I did n't say she did n't . BO KERRY ( High )  --  think we 're some kinda poor relations or something ? Relatives ? EDIE KERRY Calm down . BO KERRY ( To GUS ) You ever make four seventy-five a week ? What ? Well we did  --  more weeks than you ever saw . Yeah . Four seventy-five and they brought it around , too . EDIE KERRY ( Loud ) All right ! BO KERRY What ? EDIE KERRY The old days , the old days  --  nothing but the old days . I got nerves in me , too , y'know , not just G-strings . ( She goes ) BO KERRY ( Indicating fur ) I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAMMER Do n't matter . BO KERRY Sure , that 's the way to look at it and charge it off to experience . Listen  --  one thing this town is full of and that is crooks and deadbeats . ( Mysteriously ) Some with big names , too . I guess you heard about the swindle they got me on . p. 62 GUS HAMMER No . BO KERRY Well , I do n't like to talk without the documentary evidence , you see ? I 'll bring it around some of these days and show you something curl your crew cut . ( BO goes , closing the door . Outside , two fire engines pass , sirens at full blast . GUS spends a few moments of indecision  --  finally he goes to the alcove and knocks on the door jamb ) HELEN 'S VOICE Yeah ? GUS HAMMER Could you talk a minute ? ( HELEN steps out ) HELEN BROWN Sure . GUS HAMMER I 'm sorry . HELEN BROWN What 's there to be sorry ? GUS HAMMER If I 'm crook 'd I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BROWN Ochay , chid . GUS HAMMER I 'll send it to my aunt anyway . I 'll write her a letter with it and tell her it 's no good but I 'll send it . HELEN BROWN Why not ? GUS HAMMER After all , it 's the spirit . ( The door opens and BO bounces in , carrying the " documentary evidence " ) BO KERRY Here 's that stuff I was telling you . p. 63 GUS HAMMER Oh , yuh . HELEN BROWN This gon na take long ? BO KERRY You rushin ' me ? I ai n't started yet ! HELEN BROWN I just asked . BO KERRY I do n't have to tell it at all you do n't want to . ( He is visibly hurt ) GUS HAMMER No , go ahead . ( HELEN goes back into alcove ) BO KERRY Do n't do me no favors , now . GUS HAMMER ( Sitting ) Shoot . BO KERRY Well , see  --  speakin ' of thieves crooks racketeers deadbeats grifters robbers short-changers swindlers highbinders and confidence men  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to show you the scars of the most royal drilling of all time . Just give me your undivided and you wo n't be sorry I promise it . ( He opens a grimy brown paper envelope and brings forth a collection of documents , letters , music sheets , copyright certificates and so on which have obviously been demonstrated many times ) All right , let 's go . Now . I do n't ask anybody to take my word  --  why the hell should they ? I do n't take theirs . Only what we 're dealing with here is black and white and no mistake including if you 're color blind it makes no difference . Okay . See this ? ( GUS looks ) Okay . Now . You see here where 's it 's printed " music by : " ? p. 64 GUS HAMMER ( Reading ) " Music by Paul G. Frye . " BO KERRY Damn right . He 's dead , Paul . My partner . Now over here  --  " lee-rics by : "  --  GUS HAMMER ( Reading ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear it again , he cocks his ear ) What what ? GUS HAMMER " Lyrics by Bowman Kerry . " BO KERRY You 're damn well right ! Bowman Kerry  --  me ! That 's who . Little Bo and nobody else . GUS HAMMER Uh-huh . BO KERRY Now . Copyright certificate . Here . ( He hands it to GUS who looks at it ) Check me if I 'm wrong . April 7 , 1922 . Right ? GUS HAMMER Yup . BO KERRY D913778174 . Right ? GUS HAMMER Yes . BO KERRY ( Taking it back ) Okay . Now . ( He hands him a sheet of music ) All right  --  there 's your copyright and there 's your title . ( He watches GUS and is disappointed in the size of the reaction ) p. 65 GUS HAMMER Yes , I see . BO KERRY What the hell 's the matter with you ? GUS HAMMER What ? BO KERRY Ca n't you read ? GUS HAMMER Sure . BO KERRY Well all right then , read it . Read it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S.A. " BO KERRY ( Triumphant ) You 're damn well right ! ( He breaks into song , punching his palm sharply to convey the rhythm pattern . It 's a jolly little tune  --  reminiscent of nothing in particular ) " God bless the U.S.A.And hear us shout hooray ! Oh , say can you see ? We belong to the land of the free . " ( He stops singing and addresses GUS , impressively ) Now what the hell do you say to that ? GUS HAMMER Yeah . BO KERRY ( Putting his papers away ) You ai n't heard me make a statement or a claim . ( Slyly ) Or mention any names , great or small . ( Magnanimously ) I do n't accuse anybody of anything . I 'm just talking a few facts . Take my motto . Watch your self ! I just like to mention  --  if you put my bank account together with Mister Irving Berlin 's , you 'd have over four million dollars . ( He gathers up his things and goes  --  but not before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowingly , gestured graphically and conveyed his view of the situation in every possible way . He is gone . HELEN comes in . She has changed to blouse and slacks ) p. 66 HELEN BROWN Another nut . GUS HAMMER Sorry for the little guy . HELEN BROWN Sorry . Why do n't he write another song since 1922 ? GUS HAMMER I got my own troubles . ( He selects a record from a rack and puts it on the Libertyphone . He turns the volume low , then drops the needle somewhere along in the record with accuracy  --  he knows just where this Johnny Bothwell chorus is . It plays and he listens ) HELEN BROWN There 's a girl I used to hang out with  --  she thinks she 's on the track of something for me . A room . GUS HAMMER ( Absently ) Good . ( The chorus ends , he puts the needle same place and plays it again ) HELEN BROWN You wo n't be sorry to get me out , is that it ? GUS HAMMER Who said anything ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  GUS HAMMER ( Laughing ) Holy jumping  --  ! The way you 're so touchy and cranky we could be married , for a fact . HELEN BROWN You should live so long God ! Two three weeks ago this girl Rose over at Tango she gets real sore  --  something , I do n't know  --  I wore her shoes  --  something  --  anyway , she really blew and she hollers at me  --  I hope all your children are saxophone players it was a joke but she meant it like a curse  --  you know what I mean ? p. 67 GUS HAMMER Sure . HELEN BROWN I mean that 's funny I should suddenly meet one , ai n't it ? GUS HAMMER Anyways , it makes no difference to me . Do n't worry you 're in my way you 're not . HELEN BROWN Ochay , chid . GUS HAMMER You want some rice pudding ? My aunt sent me this recipe , so I tried some out ? HELEN BROWN How 'd it come ? GUS HAMMER I do n't know . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not hungry any more . HELEN BROWN Be the same if you ate a box of Rinso . GUS HAMMER Anyway . You want some ? HELEN BROWN Sure . What the hell , if they have to send the ambulance it can carry two the same as one . ( He gets her some rice pudding from the icebox and serves it ) You got plenty of talent , boy . Remind me to set you up in a hash house . ( The chorus ends . He plays it again ) GUS HAMMER When your ship comes in ? HELEN BROWN My ship 's been and gone , sonny . GUS HAMMER Do n't say that . p. 68 HELEN BROWN I do n't mind . I had a good time while it lasted . ( She tastes the pudding ) Delicious . In a way . What the hell . Most people go through life and just hear about it . I had a couple innings , so fine . GUS HAMMER But what happened ? HELEN BROWN Happened ? Game called on account of rain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ) That was fine . Thanks . GUS HAMMER Finish it . HELEN BROWN No thanks . GUS HAMMER Sad , huh ? HELEN BROWN It 's not that . It 's just I 've got enough seating capacity . GUS HAMMER I ca n't see it . HELEN BROWN I know you ca n't , because I 'm sitting on it . GUS HAMMER No , I did n't mean  --  I mean even when you 're not , I ca n't see it . HELEN BROWN You never look . GUS HAMMER How do you know ? ( They are looking at each other . The chorus ends again . GUS takes the record off , and puts it away carefully ) HELEN BROWN I 'm gon na get some air . That 's what I 'm really hungry for . ( GUS picks up his alto horn  --  dismantles mouthpiece from neck , neck from body , and plugs the main tube . HELEN goes into the alcove and changes her shoes ) p. 69 GUS HAMMER Say , you go by a drug store , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large , what ? GUS HAMMER Whatever 's the cheapest . HELEN BROWN Small , I would n't be surprised . GUS HAMMER ( Absently ) Yuh , I guess . HELEN BROWN You do n't want to come along a minute ? Get a breath ? GUS HAMMER I like to  --  but I better stick to this . HELEN BROWN You ca n't . It 's twenty after . GUS HAMMER  --  practice silent . If I do n't want to blow this Red Peppers deal tomorrow I better woodshed all I can . ( He picks up the body of his decapitated horn and his fingers begin to fly from position to position . HELEN watches him with a kind of disgusted fascination ) HELEN BROWN You know you 're beginning to look like a saxophone . ( She starts out ) GUS HAMMER Funny thing . It 's been in my mind . HELEN BROWN ( Stopping ) What thing ? GUS HAMMER Well , this set-up . You and me in here . I mean , you in there and me in here . HELEN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just I bet most people  --  they would n't believe it . ( A pause ) HELEN BROWN I do n't believe it myself . ( She goes . GUS watches her , his fingers still moving on the horn . Slower , slower , now they stop . The light in the room fades and its walls enclose it , as lights come up on MAC ) MAC For instance . Here 's Gus , here 's Helen . Two good kids  --  but what 's their chance ? Minus nothing . They do n't get a chance to see each other right . See each other at all . She keeps looking backward , he 's forever dreaming for later . So they do n't meet at all . There 's another piece of nature shot to hell .  --  Sad , too  --  because the way I see it  --  half the world is looking for the other half . You ever notice such a thing ? Consider it . Buyers and sellers trying to meet up and vice versa . Crooks looking for suckers . Boys for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tops and it 's interesting no end . Jobs looking for people , people for jobs . Or for trouble . ( The effect removes MAC , his time and place . Night becomes day , and as it does , the sound of a beautifully blended saxophone trio is heard , playing with a rhythm piano . It has been said that there is hardly a lovelier sound than this instrumentation and as we listen , this thought should occur . The trio is playing the saxophone chorus of Vincent Youmans ' " Sometimes I 'm Happy " as arranged for Goodman by Fletcher Henderson . It is rhythmic but moody . The walls go and we see the inside of HELEN 'S room again . It is , indeed , neater than ever before . There are four guests . Three are men dressed identically in maroon linen dinner jackets with scarf lapels  --  and maroon polka-dotted bop ties . The most important is FRANKIE JAY , leader of " The Red Peppers . " He is a thin , dark , black-eyed dazzler whose face seems incomplete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is playing the piano brilliantly , and kicking the instrument , too . Somehow he manages to provide some remarkably effective percussion . GUS is standing dressed in his best , haircut , hair slicked down  --  working over the third alto part on his stand . The other two men play from memory . CARL , the tenor man , is bald , round and bleary-eyed . An obvious stupid . TIP , the first alto  --  is an All-American boy  --  blond . They play well , all three , listening for each other , blending . The fourth guest is CARL 's girl . A red-headed gypsy type . She is silent and superior . She looks upon herself as a great beauty . She is not . They come to the end of the chorus , which finishes on an unresolved chord . They stop . GUS looks toward FRANKIE , anxiously . CARL and TIP are smoking in an instant ) p. 71 FRANKIE JAY ( Making the standard " o.k. " circle with thumb and forefinger ) Lousy ! GUS HAMMER Yeah . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . GUS HAMMER Oh , sure I realize that I just want  --  TIP ( Topping him ) only took time , man . FRANKIE JAY ( Too sharply ) All right all right ! What the hell is this ? Some kind of Floogle Street debating society ? Save your remarks . ( He rises and walks about ) Now I 'll tell you why it 's no good . It 's three instruments that 's why . Should be one . Should n't even be one . Should be a voice . ( He is full of gestures to make up for his inarticulateness ) Tongueing , phrasing , vibrato-everything . One . See ? When I 'm on the stool I 'm playing eight , nine , ten notes at a time ! ( He illustrates ) But one instrument . CARL Lopez speaking . ( From below , RALPH is heard at work ) FRANKIE JAY I only ask you guys to play three notes at a time . Too hard ? Take it from D. ( He sings ) Ra da ta da ta da @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not for long . After about ten bars , FRANKIE stamps his foot , signaling a halt , with a keyboard crash ) No no no no ! ( They stop ) Same place . Gim me you , p. 72 TIP ( TIP rips the phrase off brilliantly ) Carl . ( CARL the same ) Okay . You . ( Gus hits it . The inexpert ear should detect no difference ) Trio . One ! Two ! ( They play again for a few seconds . FRANKIE looks up ) Okay ! Kill it ! ( He speaks to Gus ) Take off a little yourself , man . What do you want ? GUS HAMMER " Japanese Sandman " ? FRANKIE JAY In F. ( He begins a heavy stomp . To CARL and TIP ) Go ! ( CARL and TIP begin to play a rhythm pattern-as they settle into it-FRANKIE points at GUS with his chin , cuing him in . GUS plays his heart out into the best chorus he can manage . As he plays , FRANKIE listens , his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stops playing and goes to the window  --  opens it wide-and looks out-up and down the fire escape . He comes back into the room , leaving the window open . He goes to the main door , opens it  --  looks up and down the hall , comes back , sits down , and resumes at the piano . Gus finishes the chorus . CARL and TIP light cigarettes again . Gus waits ) FRANKIE JAY ( Musing ) I do n't know , man , I just do n't know . Maybe you 're up to us , maybe not . How are you on that baritone ? p. 73 GUS HAMMER About the same . FRANKIE JAY Clarinet ? GUS HAMMER Well  --  FRANKIE JAY I get it . GUS HAMMER Once I know the arrangements  --  FRANKIE JAY Oh sure sure . What other instruments ? GUS HAMMER A little oboe . Not much . FRANKIE JAY Got one ? GUS HAMMER No , but I could  --  on time . FRANKIE JAY That 's okay . GUS HAMMER ( Bending down ) This little soprano  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who with ? Spike Jones ? ( He howls . CARL plays a saxophone laugh ) FRANKIE JAY All right . Can it . ( To TIP ) Get out " Easy Living . " ( Tip begins to rummage through a portfolio as FRANKIE begins to play " Easy Living " by Ralph Rainger . A tune he likes ) TIP ( Blotting his face ) You know something ? It 's plenty hot up here . p. 74 GUS HAMMER Sure is . CARL You got a bottle of beer ? GUS HAMMER I do n't think so . CARL Okay , never mind . GUS HAMMER I could get some . CARL Never mind . TIP Be nice , a cold bottle , Carl . FRANKIE JAY Later . GUS HAMMER Make you hotter , beer . TIP ( Highly offended ) What do you wan na be , man ? In charge of my kidneys ? GUS HAMMER No , I just  --  FRANKIE JAY How far is it ? The beer place ? GUS HAMMER On the corner . Take a few minutes , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll match for who goes . Odd man . ( He stops playing , takes a coin from his pocket . CARL and TIP do , too . Now Gus . They flip and compare ) Four head ! Again ! ( They flip and compare . All look at Gus ) CARL Out goes y-o-u . FRANKIE JAY They got draft do you know ? p. 75 GUS HAMMER No , I do n't . FRANKIE JAY Well , so long as you 're going . Try for draft . You got a pail ? ( He returns to the piano and the song ) GUS HAMMER No . I 'll get a pitcher from Rocco . FRANKIE JAY Do that . GUS HAMMER Anything else ? Sandwich ? TIP No , nothing . CARL ( To Gus ) Maybe a few pretzels , if they got the hard kind . TIP Pack of Camels for me , would you ? GUS HAMMER Sure . FRANKIE JAY ( To TIP ) What the hell you think he is-some Western Union ? Get your own ! TIP What 'd I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FRANKIE JAY Guy takes advantage . You know what I mean ? GUS HAMMER ( Leaving ) Be right back . FRANKIE JAY Do n't break your neck , we got plenty of time . GUS HAMMER Make yourself at home . ( He ducks out , is back in a second ) Can 's down the hall here , in case . p. 76 FRANKIE JAY Got it . ( CARL begins a wild improvisation . GUS ca n't help stopping for a moment to appreciate it . Then he hurries out.FRANKIE and CARL play on  --  soon joined by Tip on Gus 's baritone . CARL , while he plays , moves to the door , kicks it closed and crosses to look down into the street . Suddenly , he stops and takes charge ) CARL ( Snapping his fingers ) Let 's go ! Let 's go ! ( The three begin to pack . CARL gives TIP a needless shove ) Get the lead out , I 'm tellin ' you ! TIP I 'm goin ' quick as  --  ( CARL slaps him sharply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you a dozen times  --  no talkin ' when we 're workin ' . Action ! ( Now they converge on Gus 's rack . They begin to pack his instruments ! The alto , the great baritone , two clarinets , the soprano sax  --  all melt away into cases . CARL is shoving them to the window ) All right . Gim me the letter , Frank . ( He snaps his fingers ) FRANKIE JAY ( Startled ) Letter ? What letter ? CARL What letter ? What the hell letter do you think , you goof-ball ? The letter to leave , that 's all . p. 77 FRANKIE JAY I ai n't got no  --  CARL Holy jumping what a team ! FRANKIE JAY You did n't tell me  --  CARL It 's a damn wonder we got what to eat . FRANKIE JAY ( Frightened ) You did n't tell me what to write in it , Carl . ( To Tip ) Did you hear him , Tippy ? ( Tip responds with a look of disgust ) I mean I 'd of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He kicks FRANKIE in the leg with violence ) Talkin ' talkin ' ! Write it out now . You want the sucker on our tail ? You want to be looked for ? That what you want ? Hurry up ! ( FRANKIE sits down , sullen and in pain . He gets out a fountain pen . CARL hands him a sheet of music . He turns it over and prepares to write . CARL and TIP and CARL 'S girl continue the packing and stacking near the window.CARL dictates ) FRANKIE JAY Okay . ( He is rubbing his shin ) You have to blow your roof but ? CARL Dear  --  ( To TIP ) What the hell 's his name ? TIP Gus , was n't it ? Something like that . p. 78 CARL Yeah , Gus . " Dear Gus  --  Here is the dope . You lose and do not get hot  --  if you care to retain teeth , buddy . " FRANKIE JAY Yeah . CARL " This is really a good turn to you as as an alto man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thinks a moment , then mumbles ) "  --  as as an alto man  --  " ( He speaks up ) Sure two as 's  --  what the hell 's wrong with that ? FRANKIE JAY Okay . CARL "  --  as as an alto man , boy , you ca n't blow your nose . Also your personal appearance is strictly nowhere frankly . " FRANKIE JAY Yeah . CARL " Any trouble you make we will return you double . This is no  --  ( He searches for the word ) bull . " FRANKIE JAY Bull . CARL Yours truly , " The Red Peppers . " ( FRANKIE is writing as fast as he can . TIP steps out the window  --  on to the fire escape . CARL begins handing the instruments out . When they are gone  --  he follows . His girl follows him . FRANKIE props up the note and goes along . He starts to leave  --  then remembers the soprano  --  rushes back , gets it and goes out the window . He reaches back in and takes the metronome from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ravaged and still . From across the court , a guitar is crying the blues like Charlie Christian used to . The doorknob is heard turning . The locks hold . A knock . Another knock . A moment passes ) p. 79 GUS 'S VOICE Hey ! Door locked ! ( A moment passes , the knob is rattled , then we hear the key in the lock . The door opens . Gus enters with a pitcher of beer and a brown paper bag . He stops as he realizes the room is deserted . He puts the things down , then starts as he sees his empty stand . He looks about in hopeless confusion . He reaches for the phone  --  puts it down  --  sees the note  --  reads it . He is on the verge of tears  --  but anger prevents them from coming . He rushes to the window , starts back , falls on his bed , sobbing suddenly and pounding his pillow . He sits up . All at once he retches  --  his insides are turning  --  his hands go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen and leans over in an agony of nausea . He turns on the tap , sinks to the floor , his head seeking the coolness of the basin . The lights fade and the walls enclose . Lights warm on SODA sitting at her window ) SODA I told him I says it serves you right you stupid hick . The one thing not to trust is a stranger , let alone three strangers . I says to him now you do what they tell you to  --  in the letter  --  which is nothing naturally . So does he listen ? What do you think ? Of course no . Who am I ? I 'm just some nothing who 's three times as many years in good health with a stuffed full large sized safety deposit box in the Drydock and four apartments so naturally this makes me out to be some nothing who do n't know what time is it . So do n't listen to me because what the hell could I know ? So he ca n't wait to get with the cops and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back his trumpets as I got to get a call from the " Stop the Music . " But I 'll tell you what he has got a good chance of though and that 's for a few broken bones in the Bellevue . Like they said in the letter . You got to know how to handle hoodlums . Like the time that one broke into my back bedroom ? I did n't scream . I just looked at him and he screamed . ( Her light fades and the middle section re-appears . Gus is sitting and writing , surrounded by many . HELEN is there , sitting away from him . And EDIE and BO , drinking the pitcher of beer . And RALPH ) p. 80 RALPH ( To BO ) Yeah , why ? What makes you think so ? So sure ? BO KERRY Because they 're small crooks , Ralph , that 's why . Cornballs . It 's the small crooks always get caught up with . ( To RALPH ) Hell , I was tellin ' him only the other day  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence men . Look what they did to me . When I hit this town I had the most beautiful set of curls . Now not only I got no hair I owe hair . GUS HAMMER This do it , you think ? ( RALPH looks at it ) RALPH You do n't know the serial number on the baritone ? GUS HAMMER Never did . BO KERRY What 's the difference  --  they 'll scratch it off . I would , would n't you ? GUS HAMMER Just for identification , the fellow said . BO KERRY Just for a little rubdown he shoulda said . What the hell are they gon na do with all the description ? File it away . EDIE KERRY Look , it 's bad enough do n't make it worse . BO KERRY You 're right . RALPH Coffee , Gus ? p. 81 GUS HAMMER No , thanks . RALPH How do you feel , Pops ? GUS HAMMER Well , I 'll tell you . ( A pause ) I just feel like throwing in the sponge , that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that . GUS HAMMER Why ? Why not ? HELEN BROWN Anybody can do that . GUS HAMMER Well , that 's me . Anybody . GUS HAMMER It happens , kiddie . A setback . I 'm surprised you let it soak you ! GUS HAMMER Mr. McGreevy , I do n't want to say this  --  especially in front of everybody  --  only you just do n't know what the hell you are talking about nohow . Those guys just stepped in here and robbed my future , that 's all . No little setback , like you say . My future ! MAC Now now . GUS HAMMER Sure they did ! I went on the hook for those horns  --  fourteen hundred and sixty bucks to the Veterans ' Administration . Paid back two hundred and forty  --  so I still owe twelve twenty however smart you want to figure . EDIE KERRY Things happen . BO KERRY It ai n't life or death though . p. 82 GUS HAMMER Listen , to you people a horn is some kind of a toy maybe  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important about a saxophone ? MAC Maybe we could everybody chip in . GUS HAMMER No no . MAC Wait a second . BO KERRY Mac , face it . If you picked up this whole room by the heels and shook it , you 'd be lucky if you came out with a dollar twenty . ( SODA comes in ) Make that two-twenty  --  Mrs. Money just walked in . Hiya , Soda ? SODA Save your remarks , Mr. Kerry . Or should I say Mr. Lay-off ? BO KERRY That 's it . Lay off . ( He laughs ) SODA Did you hear anything yet ? From the station house ? GUS HAMMER Not a thing , no . SODA If I was you  --  I would watch your step . You do n't know toughies like I. ( The phone rings ) There ! I 'll betcha they caught them already ! BO KERRY How much ? GUS HAMMER ( On the phone ) Yuh ? Speaking Yuh Yuh . ( A long listen ) Well , that sounds great but I 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I 've run into some trouble about my horns . No , I could n't . Till when ? Yuh , well that 's nice of you but  --  piece of paper somebody ? ( He gets it from RALPH ) Yuh , go ahead . ( He writes ) Bert Zeichner , yuh . Endicott 2-4290 . Yuh . Well , in case  --  but I doubt it . Thanks , anyway . ( He hangs up , stands quietly for a moment  --  looking at the scrap of paper in his hand ) Anybody know a good alto man can leave tomorrow night  --  fifteen day Caribbean cruise  --  union scale plus expenses , white tux ? p. 83 EDIE KERRY Ai n't it always the way ? GUS HAMMER ( Still standing still ) The regular man got the sudden mumps . Maybe it 's just as well I 'm getting out of the business  --  seems to be about the only way I ever get a job . I 'm a standin for disease . Do great in an epidemic , okay . BO KERRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EDIE KERRY We ought a blow anyhow . ( She and BO rise ) BO KERRY See you , laddie . Sorry about everything . GUS HAMMER Thanks for everything . EDIE KERRY For nothing . BO KERRY ( Gaily officious ) Well , keep in touch with me . I may have something for you . ( They leave ) GUS HAMMER Well , I better get down there . RALPH ( Getting up ) Get my jacket  --  GUS HAMMER Look , Ralph , you do n't have to  --  RALPH Quiet . ( He goes ) MAC Nice boy , that Ralph . p. 84 GUS HAMMER The best . ( He begins to get himself ready for his trip to the police station . Washes , combs , brushes  --  clean shirt , necktic , etc . ) MAC Come on , Soda  --  play you some casino . SODA All I got to do . MAC Come on  --  I 'll play you for big money  --  keep you laughing and let you win  --  now you ca n't do better than that ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the hell you after ? MAC Something unusual . ( They are gone . HELEN watches GUS  --  they are both ill at ease ) GUS HAMMER Quite a crowd . HELEN BROWN Everything 's everybody 's business this day and age . GUS HAMMER Well . HELEN BROWN Just use up air . GUS HAMMER I do n't know  --  a few friends  --  you can stand things easier . HELEN BROWN What good 's backscratching ? GUS HAMMER Oh , damn ! HELEN BROWN What ? p. 85 GUS HAMMER Thing that bothers me is those guys were real musicians . Fine . HELEN BROWN ( A snort ) Fine . They were crumbs , cheap crumbs . GUS HAMMER No , honest . I know . Take my word for something  --  I mean I 'm just a square from anywhere . I guess I proved it . Next thing you know I 'll be buying the Lewisohn Stadium from somebody or a piece of Central Park . I do n't know much  --  I admit that . But I know a little about a horn  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel the worst about . If they 'd have been plain crooks or holdup guys  --  well , I 've heard about gangsters and all that and you take your chances  --  but see , these fellows they 're so good  --  why is it they had to do a thing like they done ? To me ? HELEN BROWN They made around a thousand dollars in around ten minutes . I do n't know where they pay saxophone players that  --  even that Benny Goodman . GUS HAMMER I guess not . Clarinet , he plays . HELEN BROWN Much easier to make your pile with some kind of a swindle than honest . No matter what the schoolbooks say . Another thing . You ca n't explain  --  ( RALPH appears ) RALPH Okay ? p. 86 GUS HAMMER Yuh . ( He starts out ) RALPH Got the description ? GUS HAMMER Oh , no ! Wait . ( He comes back into the room  --  gets the paper , folds it neatly into his pocket . He looks at HELEN , a long look ) So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . HELEN looks after them a moment . Now she goes to the table , picks up the scrap which GUS left . She dials . Someone nearby is taking a cello lesson  --  master and pupil are heard studying Debussy . On the phone ) Hello . Let me speak to Bert Zeichner , please . Gus Hammer . No , I 'm calling for Gus Hammer . ( She waits . Finally ) Mr. Zeichner ? I 'm calling for Gus Hammer ? Hammer , you called him up a little while ago about the job ? Yeah . Well he wants to take it ! Yeah , he 's gone to arrange about them right now so where do you want him to be and what time ? Go ahead . ( She writes ) Yuh  --  Moore-McCormack , yuh  --  ask for you . Fine . Yes , absolutely definite . Do n't worry about it . Mrs. Brown . Helen Brown . Okay ( She hangs up . As she slams down the phone lights come up on SODA . HELEN goes into the alcove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you like it ? That old devil McGreevy making up to me . He 'll have to get up early in the morning to get around Mrs. Yours Truly . Goo-goo eyes he gives me . I says to him , Listen , you probably ai n't got one left in you and if you have it 's the one that 'll kill you so go drink your beer and relax yourself . You 'll last longer . ( SODA leaves her window and comes downstairs to her roof . HELEN returns , ready to go . She dials the phone ) HELEN BROWN ( On the phone ) Avis ? This is Peggy . Fine . Listen , can I see you a few minutes very important ? I know . Anyway , I appreciate it if I can see you . Right away . ( She hangs up and hurries out . SODA now sits on a little bench . Light from the skylight illuminates her ) SODA Still and all if it was n't for the memory of my Luigi God rest him comfortable . ( Tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should have talked it over with Luigi  --  if I should marry another one in case he passed on before me which happened . But of course the subject never came up . ( Here she recovers ) He never brought it up and naturally if I 'd of brought it up he 'd of straightened my teeth  --  he was small , Luigi , but strapping . He probably would n't have cared if I went ahead with somebody else  --  after the decent interval . On the other hand , maybe he 'd of been against it  --  otherwisc , why would he have made me bury him down here in the cellar ? ( She sips away ) And he must of known how much trouble I would have , too . After all properly sealed to me means one thing and to the Board of Health another thing and to the Frank E. Campbell Company another thing . Back and forth back and forth . Poor Luigi he must of got to feel like some commuter ! Anybody else would have given it up , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same to me . " If I go ahead of you "  --  he said to me that time  --  " put me in the cellar , cara mia . Do n't put me in a cemetery with a lot of damn strangers . In Sicily , it would n't be so bad , " he said . " At least I speak the language better  --  but in a strange land with strangers  --  put me in the cellar near you . " ( Tears again and a choked throat but the bottle must be consumed in spite of all ) " And always two ton of coal on me . " That 's from when he was a kid  --  and never enough coal . He used to go picking it in the railroad yards in Sicily  --  and here , too  --  until we got on our two feet together . So that 's why he said to me always put coal on me then I 'll feel everything is okay if I just always got coal on . So there it is down there winter and summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little headstone , too  --  it gets fresh flowers daily rain or shine  --  but on him there 's coal , on Luigi  --  God rest his sexy soul ! ( She glances downward in a new flood of memory and returns to her bottle , almost done now . She goes back to her rooms , as the lights fade on her . Dawn comes up on the center section , as the walls disappear . From the street , a solitary whistler and the sounds of milk delivery . GUS is sleeping on the day bed , fitfully . He rolls over with a sigh and digs deeper into unconsciousness . A moment passes . The key in the lock  --  then the door opens noiselessly . HELEN comes in carrying a small saxophone case , new , with price tag . She carries it quietly over to the rack , puts it down and goes out into the hall . Gus sits up suddenly , looks about , looks over toward the rack from one elbow  --  not comprehending . HELEN comes back , this time managing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , thin clarinet box . She puts these by the others and starts back to close the door  --  all at once she stops and stands still as she sees that GUS is watching her ) p. 88 GUS HAMMER ( Quietly ) What 's all this ? HELEN BROWN Surprise . GUS HAMMER I 'll say . ( HELEN starts across the room ) Where you going ? HELEN BROWN Close the door . GUS HAMMER Oh . ( She closes the door . GUS picks up a little alarm clock from a chair near his bed ) This right ? Five minutes to five ? HELEN BROWN About . Yeah . ( He gets out of bed and crosses the room , wearing pajama bottoms only . He bends down and opens each case , lifting out each horn , examining it , then leaving it exposed . Meantime , HELEN removes her hat , and disposes of her accessories . GUS rises to face her ) GUS HAMMER Some mistake here . HELEN BROWN I do n't think so . GUS HAMMER What then ? HELEN BROWN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruise job  --  and you took it . GUS HAMMER Yuh . HELEN BROWN I took the liberty . GUS HAMMER Yuh. p. 89 HELEN BROWN Well , you ca n't handle it without instruments . GUS HAMMER Yuh . HELEN BROWN So there 's your instruments . GUS HAMMER These are n't mine . HELEN BROWN Sure they are . GUS HAMMER I mean they 're not my old ones . HELEN BROWN I know . GUS HAMMER Where 'd these come from ? HELEN BROWN Place on 48th Street . Ralph helped me . We had to get a guy to open up . GUS HAMMER How 'd you pay for ' em ? HELEN BROWN What 's the difference ? GUS HAMMER A lot . HELEN BROWN With money . GUS HAMMER Where 'd you get that ? HELEN BROWN You 're like Baby Snooks with questions . Why do n't you just say thanks and I 'll say you 're welcome and you can go to sleep . You got a big day tomorrow . Today , that is . GUS HAMMER I 'm no Baby Snooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , this ai n't . ( He is suddenly out of control  --  his actions preceding his thought by ten seconds . This is that dangerous time in a being 's life when he goes out of sync . GUS picks up the alto saxophone and pitches it out of the window ! The open lower part is not large enough to accommodate its flight  --  it takes part of the upper window along with a crash . A few seconds later we hear it land . Now , in a rage , GUS is on his way to the other horn  --  he picks it up , starts for the window  --  HELEN gets in his way and shoves him back into the room with violent power ) p. 90 HELEN BROWN What 's the matter with  --  GUS HAMMER Get away , I 'm warning you , before I brain you with this ! HELEN BROWN What are you  --  crazy ? GUS HAMMER No , not crazy but by God , you may drive me . ( They struggle for the horn ) HELEN BROWN What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell are you trying to make out of me ? HELEN BROWN You must be dreaming a nightmare or a  --  wake up , willya ? GUS HAMMER Dreaming is right  --  I am up ! HELEN BROWN Then what  --  GUS HAMMER Listen , baby , I 'm beat but I ai n't this beat  --  to take this kind of  --  Holy  --  HELEN BROWN I loaned it  --  what 's wrong with that ? What do you think I did  --  for the love of  --  ? Listen  --  we put a two-hundred-and-eighty down payment  --  I could n't make  --  listen , thanks for the compliment but I do n't deserve it  --  that 's really a laugh . I just loaned it  --  what 's there to fly off about ? GUS HAMMER Where ? p. 91 HELEN BROWN A friend I happen to know . GUS HAMMER What 's his name ? HELEN BROWN A lady . GUS HAMMER What 's her name ? HELEN BROWN Avis . GUS HAMMER Avis what ? HELEN BROWN Kroll . Avis Kroll . GUS HAMMER Since when is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in me so for all of a sudden ? GUS HAMMER What about you in me ? HELEN BROWN I do n't give a nothing for you or anybody or anything  --  so what do you care ? It was just a favor  --  you done me one so we 're even ! GUS HAMMER Some favor ! HELEN BROWN It was just a loan  --  you can pay it back and that 's all ! GUS HAMMER When ? HELEN BROWN Some day  --  any day . What do I care ? GUS HAMMER Well , you can just call it off . HELEN BROWN What are you ? Scared of this town ? You 're yellow  --  grabbin ' a chance to pull out  --  sure , then the rest of your life you got the consolation prize of if I'da stuck I'da made it  --  but they robbed me  --  You wo n't stand up to it  --  I 've seen hundreds like you  --  in fact I see one every day when I see myself  --  p. 92 GUS HAMMER Finished ? ( She starts out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GUS HAMMER Wait a second . ( She disappears ) Listen ! ( She comes back ) HELEN BROWN What ? GUS HAMMER Lemme have my say  --  we 're just a couple of bump-ins  --  so let 's not get too personal and as if  --  ( A gentle knock at the door . HELEN , nearer , opens it . MAC , in pajamas and robe walks in , lugging the saxophone , somewhat dented ) MAC Morning , Helen . ( To GUS ) You happen to drop this ? ( He hands it to GUS , who takes it ) I figured you must have . Slid right off my little awning . It did n't wake me  --  because I was n't sleeping . You 'd be amazed how many people are finished sleeping by this hour . That eight hours a night stuff is the bunk . Just propaganda for the mattress makers . ( He goes . GUS . studies the horn ) GUS HAMMER ( Softly ) It can be fixed up okay . Surprising . HELEN BROWN I wrote out the instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paper ) p. 93 GUS HAMMER Okay . Yeah , I saw that . I wondered what . HELEN BROWN So that 's that . GUS HAMMER The thing is , I 'm desperate  --  that 's the only reason . HELEN BROWN So okay . GUS HAMMER But I 'll never forgive you , Mrs. Brown . Never for what you 're making me out . Stoop to . HELEN BROWN Three cheers for the red , white and blue ! ( She goes . GUS fingers the sax  --  puts the neck and mouthpiece on and begins a little test tune  --  " La Cucaracha "  --  a note in the upper register squeaks ) GUS HAMMER Damn ! ( He bends the key and tries the phrase again . A loud knocking on the pipes . GUS , startled , stops . He puts the saxophone down . The knocking on the pipes stops . Offstage , the sound of a window being raised and an angry voice male ) VOICE Hey you quit your banging on the bloody pipes this time of night before I belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slam . A pause ) A FEMALE VOICE . you know better than hollering in the middle of the  --  honestly  --  there 's a small child sleeping  --  honestly ! ( A pause . Then a baby , next in this metropolitan chain reaction , is awakened and sets up a screeching howl . GUS smiles out of the window at the waking world . Now the baby wakes the German police dog in the cellar of the house two doors away  --  and he decides to earn his watchdog 's keep by barking the block down . The man yells again and continues . The woman adds her complaint . The sounds blend and mount to a deafening pitch . GUS shrugs , picks up his horn and plays again . We can hardly hear him . He can hardly hear himself . The baby is crying , the man and woman yelling . The dog is still raising hell and the neighbors ) @x Curtain . MAC sits there , in his usual place , reading a large , colored postcard . He shows it . MAC This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , except Helen , a letter . In fact , she gets a letter from him daily and some days twice . Nice letters they are , too , I understand fom Soda . She seems to know the contents . I bet there 's been more steam around her kitchen than a Turkish bath . ( The lights fade on MAC and come up on SODA ) SODA Naturally she 's still hanging around . Us he sent post cards , her he sent letters so who knows ? About fifteen sixteen different letters . What was in them I could n't tell you . Personally , I am not interested . Live and let live that 's my motto . Only I do n't like to be taken advantage . So when he comes back if they want to stay in there together still , there will be an extra charge and if they ask me what 's the extra charge for  --  I 'll tell ' em ! ( The lights fade on SODA as the center section comes alive . EDIE and HELEN are in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread out . At the moment EDIE is working on HELEN 'S head . The indefatigable trumpeter plays on and on . HELEN is reading a letter aloud ) p. 96 HELEN BROWN " Well , that is about all the news if you can call it that . Well there is no sense in my going through all the apologizing again about my behavior before leaving . The more I seem to try to explain my behavior the less it comes out in the end what I mean . Well so all this part of it will have to wait until I get back on the 23rd and I only hope you will be there to listen , because I sure shall be anxious to tell you quite a few things . Well , Bert just poked his head in and I guess it 's time for the dinner session so will close with best regards or as they say down here buenos noches . Your true friend Gus Hammer . P.S. Ochay chid . " ( She pauses . The ice crusher is outside preparing the evening 's supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BROWN I do n't know . ( She examines the envelope  --  so does EDIE ) EDIE KERRY Sure air mail . HELEN BROWN What if it was n't ? EDIE KERRY If it was n't , I would worry  --  but it is so you should worry . HELEN BROWN I do n't know what 's got into him or if he 's kidding or what . EDIE KERRY He likes you  --  what 's wrong with that ? p. 97 HELEN BROWN What 's wrong is I do n't like him . A guy like that you have to teach him all the steps . Be like working for Arthur Murray  --  I 've done that , already , too . EDIE KERRY So far all the guy is asking you is to talk  --  so let him talk . What can it hurt ? HELEN BROWN I did n't say no . Did you hear me ? EDIE KERRY Nobody 's perfect  --  you got to settle for less . You think Bo is perfect ? He 's a cluck  --  but there are times I 'm damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( She finishes a step in the waving proceedings and taps HELEN 'S head , gently . Automatically and without interrupting the flow of conversation , they change places and HELEN works on EDIE 'S head ) HELEN BROWN The only thing . How could it mean anything ? It 's an accident  --  it could have not happened in two seconds . EDIE KERRY But it did , that 's the point . HELEN BROWN We 're just a couple of bump-ins . ( The phone rings . HELEN answers it . EDIE rises , crosses to a mirror and continues the work . On the phone ) Yeah ? Speaking . Hello , Avis , I figured it was you . What do you mean how  --  it looks to me like nobody has called me except you in about three weeks . And every time with the same pitch Yeah , well I 'm getting sick of it , too . ( Louder and stiffer ) Listen , Avis  --  I told you  --  as soon as the fellow comes back  --  you 'll get paid . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I definitely will not check in ! That 's right . What do I care ? Send him . I 'll ignore him ! Do n't think I 'm scared of him or you neither . I told you you 're gon na get paid back so what more do you want ? I told you when  --  when the guy comes back . I ca n't promise tomorrow ! I ca n't promise anything . . Yeah , well the same to you and many of ' em ! Yeah . And you mine ! ( She hangs up , angrily ) What she wants from my young life . p. 98 EDIE KERRY You kill me . HELEN BROWN Yeah ? In what way ? EDIE KERRY You wo n't admit it you 're stuck on the guy . HELEN BROWN What ? EDIE KERRY I could prove it  --  even in a court of law I could prove it . HELEN BROWN They must put daffy juice in these Toni Kits . EDIE KERRY You think so . HELEN BROWN I do n't care if he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDIE KERRY Just the same you 're hoping a little . Since I 've known you , for the first time I notice you hoping a little . HELEN BROWN I 'm hoping you 'll shut up already . EDIE KERRY You got so many friends you can afford to slap me around ? ( She starts out ) HELEN BROWN Edie ( Stopping her ) EDIE KERRY Do n't admit it to me  --  just to yourself  --  that 's all  --  all I 'm asking you . HELEN BROWN Admit what ? EDIE KERRY If you do n't care about this fellow one way or another , like you say  --  then what did you go in hock for him for ? p. 99 HELEN BROWN That 's because  --  ( She stops ) EDIE KERRY  --  and how come you got the nerve to hang up on that Avis at last ? HELEN BROWN Because  --  ( Stops again ) EDIE KERRY I 'll tell you . Because now it matters to you what you do . ( HELEN flops down on the bed , disconsolately ) You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can make them feel ashamed of themselves . " My grandmother used to say it  --  only in Gaelic . HELEN BROWN I do n't know . I do n't know what I think  --  or feel  --  or want . Nothing . EDIE KERRY Relax . HELEN BROWN All I know is I 'm in trouble  --  two hundred and eighty dollars worth . EDIE KERRY Maybe if you sent  --  ( BO comes in ) BO KERRY any left in the box I 'll have a little Toni wave myself . Hiya , girls ? EDIE KERRY Bo . Do you know any way we could get two hundred and eighty dollars fast ? BO KERRY Sure . But you would n't do it . ( He whistles and bounces his eyebrows ) p. 100 EDIE KERRY Will you stop ? Helen 's got trouble . BO KERRY Oh . Sorry , Helen . EDIE KERRY ( A flash ) Say , could it be true that Mr. McGreevy 's got that life insurance policy ? BO KERRY There 's one way to find out . EDIE KERRY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask . BO KERRY Why me ? EDIE KERRY Because I say . ( He goes ) Come on , twin , let 's finish this . ( The lights go , faster than before , and the walls enclose the middle section . MAC is revealed ) MAC So I had to tell him the insurance was a gag . So he says  --  how about working on Soda ? No use , I says , I 've tried it before . If I were n't a married man I 'd ask her myself , he says . What the hell 's that got to do with it ? Everything he says  --  that 's all just everything . Next thing I know I 'm spruced up , knocking on her door , and saying " Good evening . " ( He is lost in darkness in an instant and replaced in our attention by SODA . She is on her roof , picking up straws ) p. 101 SODA The minute he says " Good evening , " I knew it was a touch . Do n't ask me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just knew . He never asked me before , God knows . So that much I was prepared for . But when he came out with the remark , two hundred and eighty dollars , honestly , it was a good thing it was n't a real hot night , because I would have fainted on the floor . As it was , I stood right up without knowing it  --  and I said to him  --  where did such a number come from  --  there 's no sense to it . And he says , it 's because I 'm asking what I need . No more no less . No less is more like it , I says . Even the fifty I should n't have given him but he deserved that much for gall alone ! ( Blackout on SODA . Lights on MAC . He is studying a copy of a daily racing sheet . After a moment , he regards the envelope ) MAC Fifty lousy dollars . I must be losing my lousy grip ! ( He studies the sheet again ) I never thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so here I am . Shows you the good of making rules and regulations and resolutions . ( He begins to make a few notations , as the fading light takes him from view . The center comes alive again . HELEN , in a slip , is washing stockings . The room has been dressed up a bit . How , it is hard to see , but somehow it all seems cleaner and neater and brighter . Pillows have been turned  --  a picture straightened here and there . Dust removed , the window repaired , and so on . HELEN is whistling , " You Go To My Head . " A sharp knock ) p. 102 HELEN BROWN Yeah ? ( No answer , but another knock ) Who is it ? ( Another knock . She puts her foot against the door , and opens it a crack . As she does so , she is sent hurtling against the wall by the force of the door being violently thrown open . A man stumbles into the room , shoulder first . He regains his balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He looks around to find HELEN , who stands near the wall , rubbing her arm . They look at one another , hotly . This is ARTIE BRAY ) ARTIE BRAY ( Smiling and pointing ) No noise I warn you once and for all ! HELEN BROWN Listen , Artie . ARTIE BRAY Do n't give me no Artie . Bray to you . Mr. Bray , let 's make it . HELEN BROWN Sure , why not ? ARTIE BRAY I do n't go for none of this familiar . I tell Avis  --  that 's her trouble  --  familiar . Not only with the hustlers , with the customers also . It do n't go . Take you . HELEN BROWN Yeah , what 's the matter with me ? ARTIE BRAY Nothing much  --  only you got one foot in the grave and the other one on a banana peel , that 's all . p. 103 HELEN BROWN Why ? ARTIE BRAY Outa line , Kewpie , you 're outa line . ( HELEN goes to him . She is in a panic for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she puts her hand on ARTIE 'S arm . As she does he looks at it ) HELEN BROWN Look , Mr. Bray . I do n't know what Avis told you on anything but I promised her  --  ARTIE BRAY ( Quietly ) Take your hand away , Kewpie . ( She does . He smooths his sleeve ) Imported cashmere . Hates the human touch , my tailor says . Like mink , the same way . HELEN BROWN Avis knows that I can  --  ( He looks her over . She is suddenly aware of her undress . She starts out ) ARTIE BRAY Where you going to ? HELEN BROWN ( Stopping ) My wrapper . Okay ? ARTIE BRAY Never mind . I do n't want you outa my sight a minute . You do n't have to get bashful with me . Or make out . As far as I 'm concerned that part of you ai n't even around . So with me , this is strictly business right down the line . HELEN BROWN It 's only money and I 'll pay her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The money is nothing . The beef is you do n't show when you say . HELEN BROWN I ca n't . ARTIE BRAY Go ahead . HELEN BROWN I changed my mind , that 's the story . ARTIE BRAY So why 'd you get into her for two-eighty , if that 's the use , change your mind . HELEN BROWN I did n't know it then . I decided after . ARTIE BRAY What they call a coincidence . HELEN BROWN Sure . ARTIE BRAY You can change all you want only before there 's a little square up . HELEN BROWN I told you . It 'll be taken care of . I told her , too . ARTIE BRAY By who ? By when ? HELEN BROWN Very soon . ARTIE BRAY When 's soon ? HELEN BROWN When the fellow comes back I gave it to . ARTIE BRAY Do n't cock and bull me , Kewpie . My eyes are too small . HELEN BROWN It 's true just the same . ARTIE BRAY Okay . Gim me a date when . p. 105 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks . ARTIE BRAY Two weeks ! We could all be dead . HELEN BROWN That 's right . So what 's the difference ? ARTIE BRAY It ai n't neat . I like everything to be neat . Look at me , for instance . Ai n't it the truth ? HELEN BROWN Sure . ARTIE BRAY You got to see the other point of view . Like the radio says  --  three sides to every story . Yours , his and the truth . See what I mean ? You 're into Avis two hundred and eighty dollars . Avis 's been level to you . She even offered to take you in she told me . HELEN BROWN That 's right . ARTIE BRAY So where do you come off ? You notice how I 'm being fair ? Also quiet ? HELEN BROWN I appreciate it . ( He moves to her ) ARTIE BRAY ( In anger ) But it do n't have to be like that ! ( He throws her into a chair and gestures , his cigarette close to her face ) You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkeyin ' around . Because if you do n't , Kewpie , you 're gon na have a hard time hustlin '  --  with one foot shorter than the other ! ( A spasm of fear from HELEN ) Now I tell you what I 'm gon na do with you . Why , I do n't know  --  I must be getting soft-hearted or maybe I just got sympathy for a dumb brute  --  which is you . So I 'm gon na give you forty-eight . It 's been done for me at times  --  only do n't miss by then . ( By way of emphasis he reaches down with his cigarette and touches it to her arm . She jumps away with a cry . He goes . The center out . Lights on MAC , who is working over his racing sheet ) p. 106 MAC They say there 's them that makes a livin ' bettin ' horses . I do n't see how they do it . If you care to know how I 'm doin '  --  gruesome . I ai n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty any more . More like twenty . See , if you want to run up a roll you got to plunge and the condition of my heart does not permit me . There 's some talk Gus may be turning up tomorrow . I hope to hell he does and takes over . All this hustle-bustle , excitement . It 's against my principle . ( Lights on him fade , as they come up on SODA in her window , complete with bottle ) SODA So she suddenly announces she 's moving , Helen . How do you like that for nerve ? I says to her what do you want to move for ? So she says she 's going down there to Baltimore for a hostess job . Not a night spot . Just a regular restaurant . So I says to her , you 're chumpy . Where are you going to find a lovely room like this in Baltimore ? At these prices ? Completely furnished  --  with all modern conveniences  --  including a fella . ( The lights fade on SODA as HELEN 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unpacking . In addition to his luggage we have already seen there is a small basket trunk . Around the room we see a number of presents and souvenirs from the Caribbean . A gaucho hat , a doll , ashtrays and wall hangings . GUS is violently tanned . He has spent a month in the southern sun , and looks it . On the whole , his spirits are high . A record on the portable is slamming out a swing samba . It repeats when ended , HELEN comes in ) p. 107 GUS HAMMER ( Greeting her ) Hey ! HELEN BROWN Hello . ( They look at each other for a long moment ) You back ? GUS HAMMER I think so . Yeah . HELEN BROWN I 'm still around I hope you do n't mind . ( He takes the needle off the record . They look at one another in the stillness . The atmosphere is awkward rather than tense . Out on the street two cabs sideswipe with accompanying brakes and drivers ' screeches ) GUS HAMMER Helen  --  HELEN BROWN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his pocket and hands it to her ) GUS HAMMER It 's a present . Nothing much . More of a souvenir . ( She takes it ) HELEN BROWN Thanks . ( She unwraps it ) GUS HAMMER They call it Aztec gold . It 's nothing much . It 's not even gold . HELEN BROWN Thanks . GUS HAMMER What 's all this about Baltimore ? HELEN BROWN Nothin  --  Just I 'm going . ( She brings forth a bronze bracelet , puts it on ) Thank you . p. 108 GUS HAMMER Did n't you get any of my letters I wrote ? HELEN BROWN Sure , why ? GUS HAMMER I do n't know the way you sound I thought maybe you did n't get them  --  I 'd have to start from scratch . HELEN BROWN Why , how 'm I supposed to sound ? GUS HAMMER Well , did you read the letters ? HELEN BROWN Sure . GUS HAMMER What do you think ? HELEN BROWN What about ? GUS HAMMER About the letters . HELEN BROWN Okay . Very nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAMMER I did n't mean the trip part . HELEN BROWN What part ? GUS HAMMER I thought about you  --  one hell of a lot . HELEN BROWN What 'd you want to do that for ? GUS HAMMER I consider you a friend . HELEN BROWN Thanks . GUS HAMMER Maybe that sounds like nothing to you . Not to me . HELEN BROWN It 's a lot . p. 109 GUS HAMMER Listen , Helen  --  I bet I never had a friend as much as you . HELEN BROWN Okay . You been nice to me , too . ( A pause ) GUS HAMMER There 's a development . This Zeichner . He 's okay . And he may want me for this city job . HELEN BROWN Yeah ? GUS HAMMER It 's a Chinese restaurant  --  three sessions and way under scale , but still  --  I mean they pay scale , but you got to kick back half  --  one of those . HELEN BROWN Yeah , well  --  until something better . GUS HAMMER I sure have thought about you one hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? GUS HAMMER Think about me , any ? HELEN BROWN I guess so . GUS HAMMER I 've got quite a few ideas I want to talk over with you . HELEN BROWN What do I know about ideas ? GUS HAMMER These you will . HELEN BROWN Like what ? GUS HAMMER Well , like about the money I owe you . p. 110 HELEN BROWN I was coming to that . We 're in some trouble , GUS . GUS HAMMER ( Delighted ) What ? HELEN BROWN Trouble . GUS HAMMER No , I mean what you called me . HELEN BROWN Gus ? GUS HAMMER Yuh . HELEN BROWN What 's the matter ? Your name , is n't it ? GUS HAMMER Sure , but you never called me it before . HELEN BROWN So ? GUS HAMMER It means something . HELEN BROWN I 'm trying to tell you much more important . I do n't want you to get hurt . Or me neither . ( Her sickness of fear is upon her again and tenseness is revealed in her voice ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BROWN ( Barely getting it out ) The trouble is about the money . GUS HAMMER Oh . HELEN BROWN We got to get it back fast . ( She is out of control and words come hard through her tears ) p. 111 GUS HAMMER ( Softly ) Wow ! HELEN BROWN You know anybody ? Or any way ? GUS HAMMER Not in a minute . HELEN BROWN How about your aunt ? In a real pinch . Or your father ? GUS HAMMER I got to send them some . HELEN BROWN Usually . Maybe if I see  --  ( She stops , thinks ) GUS HAMMER Well , let 's see tomorrow . HELEN BROWN I do n't think so . Tomorrow 's too long . ( She sits down ) Get me some water , Gus , do you mind ? ( He does so ) GUS HAMMER What 's the matter ? HELEN BROWN Nothing , just I 'm scared . GUS HAMMER Do n't be . HELEN BROWN You do n't know . GUS HAMMER Sure not . Not if you do n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sips it between phrases ) HELEN BROWN Well , the money . I loaned it from a party I used to be connected with her  --  it 's a long story and what 's the difference ? Now all of a sudden she wants it back or else I got to make good . I ca n't talk about it . p. 112 GUS HAMMER Why not ? I 'm in it with you  --  I got the use after all . HELEN BROWN is n't as if you asked me . GUS HAMMER That do n't cut any ice  --  this is something together . HELEN BROWN And right now  --  do n't forget that . GUS HAMMER Could n't I talk to her and  --  ? HELEN BROWN It 's not just her  --  if it was just her I could take care of it  --  but there 's this man . Artie Bray . You ever hear of him ? He 's been in the paper several times . GUS HAMMER No , I never did . HELEN BROWN He 's been around already . GUS HAMMER ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't start with him . GUS HAMMER just asked . HELEN BROWN The one thing he do n't listen to is reason . In fact he listens to nothing . That type . ( GUS goes to the phone and begins to dial ) GUS HAMMER Let me make a call here . ( He is waiting for a reply . The key turns in the lock  --  the door is kicked open and ARTIE comes in . He kicks the door shut with his heel . HELEN springs up with a cry  --  GUS , startled , hangs up ) p. 113 ARTIE BRAY No noise , right ? Now . Peggy Brown live here ? ( He looks at HELEN ) Close your mouth , Kewpie , there 's a draft . ( He smiles ) Where 'd I get a key to you that what you want to know ? Well , I 'll tell you . I make it my business . I got a key to everything . Or can get . ( GUS moves . ARTIE squints at him ) Who you , Junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ARTIE BRAY Did I ask you what 's your name ? What do you take me for  --  some plain-clothes man ? ( Loud ) I said who are you ? ( The phone rings . GUS looks at it uncertainly ) HELEN BROWN He 's the fellow . ARTIE BRAY What fellow ? HELEN BROWN The one I told you . ARTIE BRAY This the one he got all that scratch ? HELEN BROWN Yes . ARTIE BRAY The whole three C-notes almost ? HELEN BROWN Yes . ARTIE BRAY ( Looking him over ) Like to have a talk with you , hotstuff . You must have some tricks ! p. 114 GUS HAMMER Any time . ( The phone rings again . GUS moves to it ) ARTIE BRAY Leave it alone . All right , now  --  so let 's go . ( To HELEN ) What 's the score , Kewpie ? HELEN BROWN He 's got a few ideas . ARTIE BRAY Ideas do n't happen to be legal tender . Not in this State anyway . Have you got the bucks , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAMMER ( Quickly ) Some of it , yes . ARTIE BRAY How much is some ? ( The phone rings ) GUS HAMMER A hundred and something . ARTIE BRAY And what ? GUS HAMMER I 'll have to look . ( The phone rings ) ARTIE BRAY Go ahead . ( GUS gets his wallet out of his rear trouser pocket and counts a few bills . He puts them together and holds them out ) GUS HAMMER One twenty-two . ( ARTIE takes the bills and pockets them . The phone rings ) ARTIE BRAY I do n't even count ' em . See how I trust you ? p. 115 GUS HAMMER Okay . ARTIE BRAY Still and all , it 's not even half . All it does so far is it keeps one of you from gettin ' a cutting . Now . What about some more ? ( The phone rings ) GUS HAMMER all I 've got . ARTIE BRAY I was n't talking to you . HELEN BROWN promise you , Artie . But right now I ca n't . ARTIE BRAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a stone ! ARTIE BRAY get some out of you . You want to see me ? ( Moving slowly and gracefully , he takes an eye-glass case from his breast pocket and changes glasses . The phone rings ) Just in case I have to go to work on you , I better have these . I got poor refraction , but with these I 'm okay for any kind of close work . All I hope is I do n't have to . HELEN BROWN ( Desperately ) Tomorrow morning . ARTIE BRAY I already give you two tomorrows . How many you think there are ? GUS HAMMER ( Unstrapping it ) Wrist watch . Bulova . ( ARTIE holds out his hand , GUS gives him watch , ARTIE pockets it ) p. 116 ARTIE BRAY What about you , Kewpie ? Get generous . Do n't let Daddy do all the work . ( The phone rings ) HELEN BROWN I got nothing that 's my trouble . ARTIE BRAY No jewelry ? HELEN BROWN Sure , several . In the hock shop . 1108 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where to go . HELEN BROWN Wait a second ! ( She goes to the corner shelf and takes down the silver cup ) You want a silver cup ? Here . Real silver . ( ARTIE takes it . As he does so , he notices the bracelet , GUS ' gift . He removes it from her arm ) ARTIE BRAY I thought you said no jewelry . GUS HAMMER That 's nothing , that . ARTIE BRAY Every nothing helps . ( GUS is rummaging under the cot . He brings forth a box ) GUS HAMMER Fur piece here ! ARTIE BRAY ( Examining it ) Behave yourself ! I used to sell these . ( He throws it out of the window ) What else ? GUS HAMMER Electric razor ? Libertyphone ? p. 117 ARTIE BRAY Sure . ( GUS gets them ) HELEN BROWN I think you 're even . How about being fair ? ARTIE BRAY ( Pointing to the instrument cases ) What 's in all there ? HELEN BROWN Nothing , a few horns . ARTIE BRAY All right . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic ) No  --  listen ! GUS HAMMER ( The last straw ) Wait a minute . The only thing  --  ARTIE BRAY What thing ? HELEN BROWN They 're not his ! I mean they do n't belong to him ! ARTIE BRAY ( Smiling ) Sure not . They belong to me . ( He opens the door and speaks to someone who stands there  --  a crony ) In the car . All this nothing . ( The crony begins to load up ) If it was n't for the middle summer they could take us for two Santy Clauses . ( The crony laughs at the boss ' joke ) So that 's all . You got off very lucky . Strictly business . ( To HELEN ) Call me up whenever , Kewpie . No hard feelings . ( He goes . Silence . GUS moves to the window and looks down into the street . HELEN resumes her packing ) p. 118 HELEN BROWN Thanks , Gus . I hate to think if you had n't of been here . ( There is a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and points out of the window , wildly ) GUS HAMMER Best damn thing that ever could 've happened ! HELEN BROWN ( Regarding him oddly ) You 'll be all right in the morning . GUS HAMMER Listen , you realize what that guy just carried out ? HELEN BROWN I was standing right here , remember ? GUS HAMMER You do n't realize . That damn cup . Hell , you shoulda lost it long since . HELEN BROWN But the horns  --  GUS HAMMER There 's something more important to me than horns and my name up over the Paramount some day . HELEN BROWN We still owe on them just the same . The store called up , worried . GUS HAMMER Okay . Let ' em . No sense all of us worrying . HELEN BROWN nothing is better than something , that what you 're selling ? ( She moves again . GUS intercepts her . He is on the giddy side now ) p. 119 GUS HAMMER Nothing now  --  but the two of us . HELEN BROWN And not much of that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your hurry , Helen ? HELEN BROWN I should of gone long ago . GUS HAMMER It means something that you did n't . HELEN BROWN All right . It means something . That settle the argument ? GUS HAMMER I did n't have to come back here any more than you had to stay here  --  but I did and you did  --  that means something I tell you . HELEN BROWN So who do we call to find out what ? Antoinette Donnelly in the Daily News ? GUS HAMMER And all the way back even though I had n't heard from you  --  not even a word  --  I knew you 'd still be here . HELEN BROWN You 've made enough mistakes already without adding on me . I 'm a jinx . I been jinxing you like I did myself . GUS HAMMER Do n't be so set , Helen . Listen to  --  ( There is an imperious knock at the door . HELEN goes to answer it . The Police Department enters , in the person of MARCUS B. KARP . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheaf of papers from his breast pocket and handles them importantly ) p. 120 POLICEMAN Gus Henry in here ? GUS HAMMER Hammer . POLICEMAN What ? GUS HAMMER Gus Hammer . POLICEMAN ( Consulting his sheets ) No , Gus Henry . GUS HAMMER Well , maybe . What 's it about ? POLICEMAN I 'm Police Department .

HELEN BROWN That 's right . POLICEMAN Gus Henry . HELEN BROWN ( Resigned ) Okay . Henry . ( KARP goes to the door and shouts down ) POLICEMAN Hey , Dave ! A VOICE OFF Yo ! POLICEMAN Rightupinhere ! ( GUS starts out of the room impulsively . KARP stops him ) C'mere , boy . You got a lot to sign . p. 121 GUS HAMMER Gladly . ( As he writes ) Sure never expected to see these old pals again . ( He is signing the forms in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once a cry escapes her ) HELEN BROWN Gus ! ( She backs into the room as DAVE enters lugging a huge double bass violin . DAVE is dressed in the light green fatigue uniform with arm band of the New York Police rookie . GUS and HELEN stare at the mistake . DAVE leans the instrument against a wall ) DAVE ( To KARP ) This tag stay on or what ? POLICEMAN What tag ? DAVE Here . ( He indicates a tag which hangs from the neck of the instrument . KARP moves over to study it ) HELEN BROWN ( Softly ) Gus ! Gus ! ( GUS looks over at her in some confusion . He moves to her ) Gus , do n't say anything . GUS HAMMER ( Matching her tone ) Like what ? HELEN BROWN Like about some mistake . GUS HAMMER Listen , I ca n't . p. 122 HELEN BROWN Will you please for once . GUS HAMMER What 's the use ? I ca n't play a bull fiddle . ( A pause ) HELEN BROWN Could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ) What do you say , boy ? GUS HAMMER Some tangle here , Mister . This is just the wrong thing . POLICEMAN ( Annoyed ) What the hell did you want to sign for it then ? GUS HAMMER Well , see , I did n't realize . POLICEMAN Wait a second ! ( With what he thinks is patience ) You have some music instruments robbed ? HELEN BROWN That 's right . POLICEMAN Wait a second ! What date ? HELEN BROWN August IIth . POLICEMAN ( Looking at his sheets ) That 's right . GUS HAMMER The only thing . POLICEMAN Wait a second ! ( From the beginning ) Your name Gus Henry ? p. 123 GUS HAMMER Hammer . POLICEMAN What ? GUS HAMMER Gus Hammer . POLICEMAN That 's your name ? GUS HAMMER Sure . POLICEMAN ( The great detective ) Then what the hell did you sign all these Gus Henry for ? GUS HAMMER Well , it was just you kept saying  --  POLICEMAN You strike me a little on the backward side , boy . GUS HAMMER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ) Listen , why do n't you use your head and let it stay like it is ? GUS HAMMER ( Pointing to the bass fiddle ) I just want  --  This is no good to me . POLICEMAN ( Bawling him out ) You just want to get everything more fouled up than it already is . GUS HAMMER I do n't see why  --  POLICEMAN ( Once and for all ) Do n't give me any arguments ! ( Waves DAVE out of room ) You got the thing , I got the receipt , that 's all I know . If you do n't like it , straighten it out downtown . p. 124 GUS HAMMER ( Giving up ) Okay , okay . POLICEMAN ( As he prepares to leave ) Where you from ? Some out of town ? GUS HAMMER No , I 'm a New Yorker . POLICEMAN Well you sure in hell do n't act it ! ( He leaves . GUS and HELEN stand looking at the bass fiddle between them ) HELEN BROWN I guess it 's pretty old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( GUS moves to the instrument and takes a playing position . He plucks at a string , ineffectually ) GUS HAMMER I guess we could sell it all right or else trade . HELEN BROWN Or move in . ( She is packing her trunk again ) GUS HAMMER Anyway , it 's something . HELEN BROWN Nothing now but the three of us . GUS HAMMER Hey ! HELEN BROWN What ? GUS HAMMER That mean you 're going to stick ? HELEN BROWN No . But thanks for asking me to  --  Augustus . p. 125 GUS HAMMER But you said  --  ( He stops abruptly , then continues softly , spellbound ) Where 'd you dig that Augustus ? HELEN BROWN No place . I just said . I 'm sorry . GUS HAMMER It is n't that , but nobody ever called me that since my mother . HELEN BROWN Well do n't get us confused , kid . GUS HAMMER No , just it was funny hearing it that 's all . Helen I think I love you . HELEN BROWN When will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean for good-and everything . Together . Do you know what I 'm sayin ? The works . ( HELEN stands looking at him and reads the rest in his eyes ) HELEN BROWN ( Haltingly ) You 're a good kid only you do n't know what you 're talking about . ( He is standing close to her now ) GUS HAMMER Helen , as long as we got thrown together  --  why do n't we stay that way ? Try anyway . Helen , I 'd sure do my best for you  --  I believe in you  --  HELEN BROWN ( A whisper ) Why ? p. 126 GUS HAMMER I do n't know . You make me believe in myself  --  and besides  --  all I know is how I like to be with you and that 's all . I know I love you , Helen . I do n't think . I know . ( He touches her ) HELEN BROWN Do n't be nice to me  --  will you please ? Do n't . GUS HAMMER Why not ? HELEN BROWN I 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can it lead to ? GUS HAMMER How do I know ? HELEN BROWN See ? GUS HAMMER But now , Helen ! Ca n't we live some now ? HELEN BROWN I would n't want to get talked in . Everything bad ever happened to me was because I got talked in . GUS HAMMER Okay . HELEN BROWN Only I have to tell you  --  I never thought I could  --  If there 's anything left in me  --  ( She pauses . They look at one another , in love . GUS moves his head to hers and touches her forehead with his cheek ) Well , let 's say we 'll see . GUS HAMMER I 'll settle for that . ( He Kisses her in a rare and gentle way ) God , Helen . I 'm trembling . p. 127 HELEN BROWN If we tremble together you wo n't notice it . ( They stand and look at one another again ) But listen  --  do n't go away on any more cruises  --  not for awhile , anyhow . Till I paste myself together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , no good ? GUS HAMMER No the band part was okay  --  and the trip too , but the mixing ! That I did n't know about . HELEN BROWN Mixing ? GUS HAMMER Yeah . I do n't remember him mentioning it  --  Bert . Do you ? He claims he did . HELEN BROWN Not to me . ( A pause . GUS goes to the basin for a drink of water ) What 's mixing ? GUS HAMMER Well the staff is supposed to help balance up the shortage of men . Including the band . That 's all . HELEN BROWN Oh . Did you ? GUS HAMMER Mix ? HELEN BROWN Yuh . GUS HAMMER Sure . HELEN BROWN Much ? GUS HAMMER I do n't know what you 'd call much . p. 128 HELEN BROWN Did you mix many ? GUS HAMMER Not many  --  no . HELEN BROWN But some . GUS HAMMER Yeah , that 's about the size of it . Some . HELEN BROWN How many ? GUS HAMMER ( Thinks a moment ) Three . HELEN BROWN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HELEN BROWN ( Extra clearly ) Did you mix three different or did you mix the same one three times ? GUS HAMMER Three different . HELEN BROWN That settles it ! That 's the last time you go on that kind of a job . GUS HAMMER ( Smiling ) I know what my job is now . ( A pause , then a whisper ) HELEN BROWN Ochay , chid . ( HELEN begins unpacking and GUS is helping her , as the walls close in slowly and take them from view . Lights come up on MAC as he comes into his position . He carries a sheaf of money in his right hand . On his chair there is a brown paper shopping bag which he now picks up , along with his other left-behind belongings . Lights , too , on SODA , in her accustomed place ) p. 129 MAC ( Holding up the money ) Doin ' a little better now . It 's around eighty dollars . Up and down , up and down but still hoping . Whatever happens wo n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought  --  money is the main thing . Wrong . Breathing is the main thing . ( He reaches into the bag ) Say , look at this I happened to find . When it rains it pours . ( He brings forth the well known fur piece and displays it , proudly ) Gon na give it to Helen . ( He stuffs it back into the bag ) SODA My dentist says to me a day before yesterday he says you need two fillings in your cavities . You know what I said to him ? I said you go to hell ! ( She returns to her pop bottle , confident and happy and boss . MAC , by now , is ready to leave . He tips his hat ) MAC Well . Been nice talking to you . ( He goes . SODA sips .
