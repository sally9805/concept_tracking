PART II THERE is nearly universal acceptance in the United States today of the idea that unregu- lated profit ought to be out for the duration . Nevertheless , we would prove ourselves to be as foolish as any people in history were we to lose sight of the fact that freedom to make profits in the past is the source of our present military strength . This is said unequivocally . Begin by considering aluminum . It is vital in countless places in war production ; in the making of steel , in the manufacture of explosives , radio equipment , incendiary bombs , photographic materials and numerous other things . But the great use of it , now dwarfing all others , is in aircraft manufacture . Our enemies are as dependent on aluminum as we are . It is used in Zeros and Messerschmitts as in Spitfires and Airacobras . To make one Flying Fortress about 26,000 pounds of aluminum are required , and proportionate amounts in every combat airplane ? engines , wings , propellers , fuselage and instruments . But the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aluminum supply . Suddenly national security was crucially threatened for want of airplanes . In consequence , the first impact of war on free markets and free enterprise in the United States was made on transactions in aluminum . The Government said , in effect , " Aluminum is nationalized . " Thereafter no use of aluminum could be made without Government sanction . That order was issued in February , 1941 . The President 's original call for 50,000 airplanes had been amended by this time ; now he was calling for 185,000 airplanes by the end of 1943 . Relatively few have challenged the necessity for control of our economic life in wartime ; yet it must be kept in mind that the various Government control agencies did not and do not create that which they regulate . They have not made one pound of aluminum or anything else . This is something that By BOYDEN SPARKES should not be lost sight of during the necessary wartime limitations on free enterprise , because , necessary as they are in war , the limitations , if applied too long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first order touching aluminum was issued , it was still supposed rather generally that we would somehow manage to graft a war economy onto our peacetime economy . It is remembered around the War Production Board that the significance of the order lifting aluminum out of the realm of free trading was realized by surprisingly few people . A newspaperman who covered the activities of the Office of Production Management for one of the lesser news services actually debated with the men who gave out this news as to whether much of it was worth distributing to newspapers . The details , he said , were too technical . To interpret his point of view he said , " It 's dull . It does n't have any housewife angle . " Actually it is difficult to think offhand how any story could have more interest for an American home . Just think . If , by some kind of magic , all aluminum suddenly vanished from your home , you would not even be able to telephone for help in your extraordinary plight , because your telephone would be hopelessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone , your automobile would be just so much junk . Practically every mechanical convenience would be out of order  --  your electric refrigerator , your vacuum cleaner , your washing machine , your radio , your sun lamp , your lights . In seven out of eight homes many kitchen utensils would have disappeared . This does not begin to be a complete list of the minor disasters that would afflict a comfortable American home suddenly deprived of aluminum . Apply this situation to the whole country and the consequences would be catastrophic . Distribution of electric power in the United States is accomplished by means of more than a millionmiles of aluminum cable . Without this there would be an almost complete stoppage of every sort of mechanical device depending on electricity for its operation , including all the machine tools in factories . We had accepted the service of aluminum increasingly year by year , taking it for granted , as is the habit of Americans . Then suddenly our leaders discovered that Germany 's power to molest us was measurable in tons of aluminum . Right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aluminum is being made at the rate of 520 , - 000,000 pounds a year . But the capacity inside the German lines , and therefore available for the manufacture of airplanes and other military uses , is reckoned at 1,000,000,000 pounds a year , possibly a shade more . That , if you please , represents Germany 's utmost , all that can be produced by means of the vaunted German efficiency plus brigandage on a continental scale . How is it in America ? During 1942 we have been producing aluminum at the rate of about 1,000,000 , - 000 pounds per year . We have been importing several hundred million pounds in addition . But in the year ahead , production , imports and recovery of secondary and scrap aluminum probably will exceed 3,000,000,000 pounds . Consequently , during 1943 the United States should have available for the manufacture of aircraft two and a half times as much aluminum as Germany . What about Japan ? In the opinion of some people , she is the most dangerous enemy . Nevertheless , the Japs , too , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of their capacity to produce aluminum . The ablest estimate of Japanese production credits them with a capacity somewhat less than 120,000,000 pounds a year . Even this figure gives them the benefit of certain doubts . They did add to their potential output by capturing deposits of bauxite ore in Malaya . If they have succeeded in developing these , they still have to ship the ore 25 Volumes could and doubtless will be written about the role of women in the war program . through seas in which are hidden many hostile submarines . In any event , our leaders are able to figure that as to aluminum the United States is better than the Japs by at least a ratio of 25 to 1 and better than Germany by a ratio of 2 ! " to 1 . Something has been operating in our favor in this vital field . Recently I saw something made a long time ago , an aluminum stewpan , the first thing of its kind ever to be made with what had been a precious metal . Arthur Vining Davis , chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given this stewpan to his mother , who cooked with it for many years , until her death . But the successors of that cooking utensil were sold aggressively , until today no one could say what part of our tremendous capacity to produce aluminum traces back to it . I also saw a scale model of a car of the first streamlined train made of aluminum . Near by was a large forging , one blade of an airplane propeller ; also engine parts . But these objects represented aluminum in its glory  --  at fifteen cents a pound . At eight dollars a pound , Mr. Davis would have you know , it took a lot of selling to get anybody to use aluminum for anything . For untold years aluminum had been a metallic enigma to men of science . Although the most abundant of metallic elements found in the earth 's crust , it is locked so tightly in compounds in which it occurs in Nature that none was isolated until a little more than 100 years ago . By 1852 , experimenters in Europe had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were actually small quantities on the market  --  at $545 a pound . A king could afford a dinner service made of this amazingly light , malleable and beautiful metal . Napoleon III , fascinated by possibilities suggested by his aluminum dinner service , commissioned a French scientist to find a way of making aluminum cheap . But a scientist alone could never hope to do that . As has been proved over and over in the United States , science has to be helped in this process by volume demand ; and that calls for salesmen . In 1886 , Charles M. Hall , a student at Oberlin College , in Ohio , was struck by a statement he heard , that every clay ( Continued on Pugs 53 ) They roll out the aluminum in sheets two city blocks long , one a minute , at this Alcoa mill . ALUMINUM CO/0 , NY OF ANIFILSCA he told her . " ' Sides , I been goin ' to come see you . I wanted to tell you ? Nell , you got no idea what 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the same story he had told us , but with some new items  --  the most astonishing being that Ed Grady had sent him twenty dollars and promised the rest . " It just shows you , " he said happily . " Makin ' money is easy . Take John D. Rockefeller , he was a poor man once . " She listened , and she watched him , and a most curious expression grew and settled in her face  --  bewilderment at first , and unbelief , and then something else , a look that somehow made me think of mother . And meanwhile they walked toward the river and Louis ' trotline , and I tagged along . The line was set in a pool just above the bend . Louis looked down at it . " Hey , I got somethin ' ! " he yelled . " That 's how it goes  --  even the fish bite for me nowadays . " He laughed exultantly , scrambling down the steep low bank . " Say , looka there ! Ai n't he a beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , almost as long as his arm , that had blundered on to the hook somehow . But it might have been a salmon , the way Louis acted . " A lot of good eatin ' in that , " he told us , climbing to the top of the bank . " Some people wo n't eat sucker , but there 's nothing better , cooked just right . What you do , you take ? " " Louis . " Nell 's face had the same strange look , only more so , and her voice was not like leaves rustling ; it was sharp and cold , like the east wind blowing against us . " Louis , Tuesday was my birthday . " " Huh ? Say , that 's right . Well , many happy returns . . . Gosh , it 's gettin ' late ; I got to get after my milkin ' job . But first , I want to show you Here , hold this . " He thrust the dead fish at her , and she took it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeal or act silly as some girls would . She stood staring down at the fish while Louis dragged his roll of bills from his pocket . " Look at ' em ! " he cried . " Ever see anything prettier , Nell ? " He let the ends flutter in the wind and bent his ear to listen . " Sweet music , " he said , and laughed . " Well , I got to hustle . I 'll take No , you take the fish . Go on , take it and welcome . It 'll be a kind of birthday present for you , hey ? " She held the fish in her two hands and she swung it like a baseball bat , and for a girl she did all right , with plenty of shoulder behind it . It took Louis right across the eyes . He squawked like a scared duck and clutched the air as he went over backwards , down the bank ; and the bills were a pitiful flutter of green down the wind , and Louis was a hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid stream , the current broken and foaming over the rocks in the river bed . The east wind carried the bank notes far out and the careless water snatched them and they were gone . Louis crept up the bank on all fours . He sat on a rock and gurgled , and water ran out of his ears , and Nell stood and watched him and tapped her foot thoughtfully . " All right , " she said , " can you listen ? I said Tuesday was my birthday . I came of age . What pa says about two hundred dollars or anything else do n't bind me no more . Louis , I like you the way you used to be , and I do n't care if you got two hundred dollars or two cents , long as you 're Louis . When I want to marry John D. Rockefeller , I 'll write him a letter and say so . Now , Louis , I 'm askin ' you fair , if you want to marry me and be Louis again , tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , sobbing breath ? " if you do n't , tell me , and I 'll push you back in the river again an ' you can swim for your darned ol ' money . " Louis looked from the river to Nellie . His teeth were chattering and he had a blue look . He said , " Why , Nell . Why , yes , Nell , certainly . Why , shucks , Nell girl , ? what 's money ? I do n't " He got to his feet , and he noticed me . " Bub , " he said , " had n't you better go home ? Your folks might be worried . . . Here , wait . " His hand sought his pocket in a familiar gesture . " Here , Bub , " he said . " You want seventy-four cents ? Go on , take it ! " SHOOT THE WORKS ! ( Continued from Pogo 25 ) hank was a potential source of aluminum . Here was an opportunity . He began experimenting with chemical processes in his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally he decided electricity was probably the most efficient means of obtaining aluminum . Nine months after graduation from college , he succeeded . In a small crucible he first melted some cryolite , a sodium-aluminum-fluoride mineral , and then dissolved aluminum oxide in it . After he had passed an electric current through the mixture , the incandescent fluid contents of the crucible cooled in an iron skillet , forming a saltlike cake . Crushing this with a hammer , Hall found that for which he had been searching during all those months of unrewarded experimenting , a concentration of aluminum , button size . How did Arthur Davis get mixed up with aluminum ? His father was a minister in Boston , and one member of the congregation was Capt . Alfred Hunt , probably the first man in this country who had the right to call himself a metallurgist . He was a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . It was natural for young Hall to submit his invention to the foremost metallurgist . Captain Hunt thought it was a good thing and promoted a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunt to young Davis , about to be graduated from Amherst , to join Hall and help him make aluminum . On the front of the harnlike establishment where the two young men went to work was a sign , THE PITTSBURGH REDUCTION COMPANY . This was later to become the Aluminum Company of America . Davis was already a part of it when Hall poured into a sand mold the first molten aluminum of the new business . It made a small cake about as big as a man 's hand . What was the force by which that insignificant capacity to produce aluminum has been expanded until this continent can produce billions of pounds a year  --  as much as all the rest of the world ? In giving you an answer Mr. Davis is forthright . He does n't merely say " free enterprise . " He says " profit . " It is a pleasure to meet a man who has n't become timid about using the word . The aviation industry owes much more than just aluminum to the fact that the Aluminum Company of America was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could induce the railroad-car builders to attempt to make a streamlined train out of aluminum , the company had been obliged to spend its own money learning how to make the big center beams , the car backbones , out of aluminum . Just as they had had to explore each field of manufacture , from tea kettles to railroad cars , before they could induce manufacturers to use a superior material , so they went to work for the aviation industry . At first this had appeared as a secondary transportation market . Stronger alloys were needed . Of thirty-four aluminum alloys used in making airplanes today , twenty-nine were developed by the Aluminum Company of America . They developed alloys which made it possible for the first time to forge aluminum . Then they developed the equipment to forge it . There had to he an enormous first investment in order to prove to manufacturers that it could be done . They installed huge banks of hammers of their own designing , made a new art . Out of this work , inadequately sketched here , aluminum f orgings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is believed , will cut the weight of four-engined bombers by 5000 pounds . In anticipation of the race to build airplanes , the company set research men to work in 1939 to devise a better method of rolling aluminum sheets for aircraft . Out of this work came a rolling mill the like of which had never been seen . Heavier pressures are required to roll aluminum than steel . This mill went into service a few months after Dunkirk . It rolled aircraft sheets fifty times as fast as they had ever been rolled before . Already four of those mills are in operation , and the company is supervising the construction of others like them for the Government . However , we needed more than aluminum and more than aircraft . Judge Robert Patterson , the Under Secretary of War , went into the War Department to help in the emergency that began with Dunkirk . The work of arming and equipping our nation was immeasurable . Judge Patterson says , " We needed everything . We sorely needed the bread and butter of warfare ? smokeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ? Airplanes are no good without ammunition . Tanks , artillery , infantry , all your fighting men need explosives , else they can not fight . Moreover , under our system the Army now supplies the Navy with its powder and TNT . " However , in the War Department there were specialists who knew how to get smokeless powder and TNT if Congress would provide the money . Even before it did provide the money , though , the telephone in the office of Mr. E. B. Yancey , general manager of the Explosives Department of the Du Pont Company in Wilmington , Delaware , was ringing . General Harris , of the Army Ordnance Department , was calling , knowing the Du Pont were more experienced in the manufacture of explosives than anyone else in the country . Now , when the Government of the United States wanted powder and TNT , it was yelling . " Come down to Washington , " said General Harris , asserting the privilege of an old friend . " I want to see you . " Mr. Yancey , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things began to happen . At that time there were 54,800 employees on the pay roll of the big Du Pont Company . They were making toothbrushes , nylon for women 's hose , cellophane for packaging , nitrates for fertilier and explosives , dyes , plastics , rayon , synthetic rubber , vitamins , tetraethyl lead for high-octane gasoline , and a whole catalogue of other chemical products . They were making powder for sportsmen , and dynamite , tons of it , for blasting in mines , quarries , road building and other construction work . But as a matter of policy the Du Ponts , whose name for generations had been a synonym for military explosives , had reduced operations in this field to an insignificant part of their business . There are no important commercial uses for TNT , none for military smokeless powder . Out of the whole vast Du Pont organization , the general manager of the Explosives Department and those who shared with him the know-how of making military explosives could have been gathered into one room . Instruments of production ? There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the river from the Du Pont offices in Wilmington . Out at Barksdale , Wisconsin , there was a small plant making TNT . For about ten years after the last war that plant stood idle . Instead of tearing it down , as business sense suggested , the company had kept it in repair . Then there developed a small commercial demand for TNT , really insufficient to justify operation of a plant that was perennially in the red . Members of the executive committee of the Du Pont Company had kept those two small plants in operation largely from a sense of public duty . If you like , however , assume that they acted only through hope of future profit ; if so , then that hope of profit is the thing that has saved us as to powder and TNT . But the Du Ponts had done more . They had fostered experimental work of incalculable value , now , to the United States and our allies . At the request of Army and Navy officers that work went on . It went on even while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterizing Americans engaged in the manufacture of explosives , aircraft engines , steel and other things as " Merchants of Death . " There had been one grave fault in the excellent Pyro powder made for use by the American military forces in the first World War . It had a limited life ; in general , about twenty years . After the armistice there were hundreds of millions of pounds of powder left . A lot of it went bad in ten years . It would take up a certain amount of moisture from the atmosphere , and that brought about a chemical reaction . This tendency , called hygroscopic , compelled the Army to keep a constant watch over it . In spite of watchfulness and regular tests , a magazine did blow up at Aberdeen . The powder had gone off spontaneously . The Army wanted a powder that would last . If we had such a powder we could always be better prepared for war  --  at least as to powder . So the Ordnance Department had representatives of explosive corporations , including the Du Pont Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along different lines trying to get an ideal military smokeless powder . Army men agree that the Du Pont organization  --  after some years of research  --  got the best answer to the problem . What they developed was a nearly flashless and practically nonhygroscopic powder . Accelerated tests indicate that this powder will have two or three times the length of life of the powder made for the last war . Consequently , when the Du Pont officials went to Washington to keep their appointment with General Harris , they knew that , at least to the extent that a process was ready , the United States was better off than in the last war , when there was uncertainty even about the process to be used . We went into the other war on April 6 , 1917 , but it was not until February 6 , 1918 , that the Du Pants were permitted to break ground for the first United States Government smokeless-powder plant . Ten months after the declaration of war . However , it had four other large plants it was operating , making powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials arrived in Washington and talked with General Harris an June 17 , 1940 , things happened fast . Money became available by July 1 , 1940 . The contracts for two plants  --  one for this Government and one for the Tennessee Powder Company , a British corporation  --  were ready on July second . By the time the lawyers got through , it was July eighteenth . The day after that , the Du Pants started building a big schoolhouse close to their little smokeless-powder plant across the river from Wilmington . The same thing was done at the Barksdale , Wisconsin , TNT plant . These schools were operated day and night , three shifts . The students  --  young chemical engineers and high-school graduates  --  divided their time between the classrooms and the plants , being given an intensive course in the manufacture of military explosives . The teachers in these schools were experienced makers of explosives ; key men from the eight or ten Du Pont explosives plants . Explosive Miracles The Du Pont official did not recruit men who had worked in explosives plants in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too old . Ordinary workers would serve forty-eight hours a week , with one day off , but not the supervisory force . He knew that the men who run explosives plants in wartime must expect to work seventeen hours or more a day , seven days a week . Explosives plants in wartime never shut down , not even for Christmas . When those first Government contracts were signed , the engineering organization of the Du Pont Company had also gone to work immediately . They found a site on a river . These plants have to be close to a big supply of water . This $100,000,000 undertaking would require as much water as a city with a population of a million . The first thing they did was build a fence . Thereafter it was simply a matter of how fast they could get materials . Nine months after the contracts were signed that plant was producing powder . But that was just a small part of the program that got under way . The Hercules Powder Company signed a contract at the end of July , 1940 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after about the same length of time . Plants are going today from Minnesota to Alabama in a gigantic explosivesmaking effort . Today the contracts in this field of ordnance call for an expenditure of $3,500,000,000 . The Du Pont engineering force , leapfrogging steam-shovel men , carpenters , masons and plumbers from one site to another , kept 30,000 or more workmen busy creating these new facilities . This was an epic performance , and only a hint of the whole tale can be told now . To get clear water from a muddy river , the engineers sank deep shafts , tunneled under the river and made of the river bed a filter . Another time , at another place , delay was threatened because they could not get steam boilers . The steam was needed both for processing and for power . So they ran steam locomotives into the plant , clamped the wheels to the rails , and they had a power plant . Surely the making of explosives is a strange art , far removed from other kinds of manufacturing operations . Yet this art , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups of men , has been swiftly expanded into an enormous industry . The powder operation has been one of the most satisfactory parts of the warprod uction program . If we had kept powder mills and TNT plants of the last war in stand-by condition , we would have been better prepared for this war , but nothing is more clear today than the fact that you can not keep an art in a stand-by condition . In 1942 , because of advances in the art , to make X pounds of TNT only one third as much plant is required , and cotton linters and nitrates are transformed into smokeless powder in less than half the time required at the beginning of the first World War . Clearly , as to explosives , the real arsenal was not at Picatinny or any of the places where ammunition was stored . The true arsenals were more nearly in the Du Pont organization and the Hercules Powder Company . Modern arsenals ought to be places where we guard and cherish , not stores of things but capacity to produce those things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out what a tank looks like before he started making them by thousands , as automobiles are made . It was less than two weeks after William Knudsen , ex-president of General Motors Corporation , had arrived in Washington , at the end of May , 1940 , that he called Detroit and talked to his friend and rival manufacturer , the president of the Chrysler Corporation . In the 20 's they had worked together in the Chevrolet operation of General Motors . " K. T. , can I see you in Detroit ? " " Sure . When ? " When they got together the following Sunday , Mr. Knudsen said he thought somebody in the automobile business ought to get into tank production , because , as he explained , " there are not very many people who understand that gearing . " The average person looking at a tank sees the guns sticking from the turrets , marvels at the caterpillar treads . But when you take one apart , piece by piece , you get a different impression . About half of the productive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parts that make it go . To Knudsen 's direct query , " Can you make tanks ? " Keller replied , " Yes . Where can I see one ? " Three days later Mr. Keller and a few of his associates from the Chrysler Corporation were admitted to the arsenal at Rock Island . Essentially , what was being introduced into the nation 's tank program at this point was management with a superior understanding of mass production . For several years General Wesson , as chief of the Ordnance Department , had dreamed of a special tank arsenal tooled for mass production . His years in ordnance work , requiring study of industrial processes , had convinced him mass production was the great American weapon . The automotive industry 's technique applied to tanks would enable America to produce tanks on a matchless scale . Furthermore , after the initial investment , such tanks would cost less and less . But this scheme would become possible only when the Government was willing to order tanks by thousands instead of hundreds . General Wesson finally succeeded in arranging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with the British . Our own tanks were being redesigned then . When British officials came over to arrange for tank production , General Wesson became a salesman , Here was his chance for volume . " Come have a look at our tank , " he said , and took the British to the proving ground . From the beginning , the British had seen the advantage of pooling , but they were naturally partial to their own tank designs . Yet when they saw a new American tank perform at the proving grounds they were quickly sold . In many ways the American tank was infinitely better . Yet the British tank , too , was superior in certain ways . An agreement was reached whereby certain advantages of the British design would be applied to the American medium tank . With both countries committed to one kind of medium tank , we had volume in sight . A Secret From London An eighty-pound bundle that came to the Ordnance Department in 1929 by way of the diplomatic mail pouch from the American embassy in London contained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanks made for the United States Army today . General Wesson was in London , and one day while being shown through an engineering shop , he saw something that was being made experimentally for Henry Ford 's tractor plant in Ireland . It was a rubber-jointed track for a caterpillar tractor . The caterpillar tractor , peculiar example of American inventiveness , an implement designed to advance over rough terrain on an endless track , was the progenitor of the military tank . Indeed , the very first tanks , a great military surprise effected by the British in the last war , were simply armored adaptations of caterpillar tractors shipped from Peoria , Illinois . No great knowledge of mechanics is necessary to appreciate General Wesson 's excitement as he looked at that rubber-jointed track . From the end of the last war military men in every first-rank country had been struggling for ways to develop ponderous , slow tanks into high-speed military vehicles . One great obstacle was that in bending around sprocket wheels the treads of a track held together by naked steel pins , to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss through friction . There are two pins crosswise in each tread . But the pins for this Ford experimental job wen encircled by rubber bushings . " The rubber bushings are springlike in their action , " an engineer explained to General Wesson . " There is much less power loss and the pins do n't wear out . " When General Wesson left the shop he carried a gift  --  three links of that track with rubber-bushed pins . He still remembers the outraged tone in which objections were voiced by the messenger who had to carry to the United States the diplomatic pouch into which that heavy package had been stuffed . Some months later , in a gunny sack , it traveled with Wesson to Cleveland , where he dumped it out on a conference table at which sat some of the best engineering minds in American industry . " Gentlemen , here is a rubber-jointed track , " said the Army officer , and then he extolled its possibilities as a means of overcoming problems of tank mobility . That committee included the chairman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the research department of an Akron rubber company , the chief engineer of the Caterpillar Tractor Company , an oilcompany technical man , and others , all selected by the Society of Automotive Engineers . Each of various sections of the Ordnance Department was working with an advisory committee of technical men in civil life between the last war and this one . From this beginning there was evolved a track much better than the sample . The new tracks were an amazing improvement when applied to thirteen-ton tanks . Much power previously lost through friction was now transmuted into speed . With tanks , as with warships , the designers constantly must weigh the three fundamental control factors of speed , protection and gun power . Consequently , tank armor was another big problem for the solution of which the Ordnance Department turned to industry . That was not solved in a few minutes ; it took years , really . The Ordnance Department was at work on this problem in 1929 and 1930 , handicapped , as usual , by a lack of money . Already it was apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection against armor-piercing bullets . When General Wesson became chief of the technical staff of the Ordnance Department , there were two schools of thought on armor plate for tanks . One group wanted to start developing a steel for tank light armor by actual steel-making experiments in their own arsenals . Certain preparations had been made . Wesson said , " Throw that all out . We 'll have our specifications for armor based on performance and we 'll give a bonus to any steel company that exceeds a specification . " What was clear to General Wesson was that hope of profit is the mainspring of human endeavor . Furthermore , he knew that the metallurgical staffs of the various steel companies already knew how to make more than 1,500,000 kinds of steel . Enlisting that know-how was simply a matter of enlisting the free-enterprise system . From July 15 to July 22 , 1940 , 197 production experts of the Chrysler Corporation were studying blueprints . The boss had brought 186 pounds of blueprints from Rock Island . Also they were making a wooden mock-up of a tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written in the blueprints . During that same period there was growing in this automobile company a plan for a great Governmentowned tank arsenal on the lines of an automobile factory . Mr. Keller took that idea to Washington , and it was quickly adopted on the enthusiastic recommendations of William Knudsen and General Wesson . It was agreed that the Government needed a permanent tank arsenal , in war or peace time , from now on . It should always have a permanent engineering force and a strong organization as constantly concerned with developing better tanks as the other arsenals are with various kinds of smaller ordnance . It would be equally concerned with keeping up to date its tooling for mass production . It ought to be ready for volume production of a new and improved tank model in the same way that an automobile company must be ready to meet competition . After all , the inability of other nations to counter immediately the volume production of advanced models of tanks , aircraft and other weapons of Hitler &; Company brought the world to its present plight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppliers , then there could be a much more orderly transition from peacetime activities to war production . Indeed , automobile workers might be kept in training for tank production while they are making automobiles . Today the tank arsenal exists . The Chrysler Corporation , on August 15 , 1940 , received a Government contract to build and equip a $20,000,000 tank plant . In the following month , construction began on farmland near Detroit . The first M-3 twenty-eightton tank rolled out of the plant for delivery to the Army on April 23 , 1941 . Government-owned , the plant was leased , at one dollar a year , to the Chrysler Corporation for five years . There is plenty of reason for believing that it is the biggest tank-manufacturing enterprise in the world . Incidentally , there are about 700 suppliers or parts makers feeding the products of other factories into those tanks . Over and over since Dunkirk , free enterprise has been proving itself to be the actual citadel of America . The talisman which has guarded this citadel is enshrined in the Declaration of Independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness .
