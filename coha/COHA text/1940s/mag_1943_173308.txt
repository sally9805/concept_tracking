Entendez-vous dans les campagnes <P> Mugir ces feroces soldats ? <P> Ils viennent jusque dans nos bras <P> Egorger nos fils , nos compagnes <P> - La Marseillaise <P> As wild and angry as when Frenchmen had cried " a has la Bastille ! " , the voice of French resistance echoed last week from the Pyrenees to the Swiss Alps . In its violent aspects it was still a minority resistance . But it spoke with gunfire in Paris , with hand grenades in Lyon . <P> The immediate cause of the outbreaks was Germany 's attempt to drain France of all available manpower . The Germans , taking over from Pierre Laval the job of recruiting an additional 40,000 French workmen , launched one of the biggest manhunts in history . They sought workmen to build up the fortifications of Hitler 's " festung Europa , " for work in German factories , for services of supply behind German lines in Russia . <P> Frenchmen hid out in cities . Many fled to the Alps , many to the wild Haute-Savoie region along the Swiss frontier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers of the French Army . From " somewhere in France , " a " Headquarters of Francs-Tireurs and Partisans " reported that 282 German officers and men had been killed , 14 trains wrecked , 49 locomotives destroyed , four bridges blown up , ten French quislings executed , between Dec. 20 and Jan. 20 . <P> The rumble of gunfire was heard in Switzerland . The Fighting French , in contact with French underground workers , reported 500 Germans killed throughout France last week . Saboteurs blew up a troop train near Dijon , killed 250 . In Lyon a German detachment was ambushed and scattered with hand grenades . Bombs killed 23 Nazi officers at a Lille cafe . For the fifth time since 1941 , an unsuccessful attempt was made to assassinate the arch-collaborationist Marcel Dat . <P> Most Frenchmen were still imprisoned and frustrated within la patrie , but they were united in hatred of the Hun and of collaboration . London reports claimed that 80% of the French people now recognized General Charles de Gaulle as their symbol of resistance . They also recognized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manpower can be slowed only by French resistance , halted only by a second front . Pending the day of invasion , Frenchmen remembered : <P> Aux armes , Citoyens ! <P> Formez vos bataillons !
