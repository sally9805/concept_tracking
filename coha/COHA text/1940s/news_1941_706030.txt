txt The Ark Royal sank only 25 miles from Gibraltar after the damages carrier made a gallant but futile attempt to reach the big rock , a Reuters correspondent who was aboard related today . For 12 hours the vessel struggled toward port with a gaping torpedo hole in her slanting side , the correspondent said " But at 4:30 a. m. yesterday the Captain sadly realized his ship could not be saved and gave the order to abandon ship . " he wrote . " Two hours later the majestic Ark Royal sank . " Senior officers who remained aboard after the initial " abandon ship " called back the engine room staff in an effort to drive her to port . " We found her switchboard had been smashed , " said one engineer onTcer , " but managed to get the dynamos working with portable apparatus . " An officer aboard a destroyer which stood by to the end said : " Just btfore she sank she had a 35-degree list to the starboard . We realized she was finished . She toppled over like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , then gently slid beneath the waves . " The torpedo which originally struck the big ship put out all lights . " In only a matter of moments she was listing alarmingly , " the correspondent said . " The engine : stopped and it was then that the first order was given to abandon ship . The sea was calm so that an accompanying destroyer was able to come close under the rails and throw up ropes on which the men slipped down to the destroyer 's forecastle . " ' This is a luxury torpedoing , ' " commented one Marine Lieutenant as he swung safely to the destroyer . The Captain , some senior and engineer officers and a number of seamen remained aboard for an unsuccessful attempt to get the engines working again .
