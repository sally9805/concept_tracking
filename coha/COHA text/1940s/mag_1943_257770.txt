BATTLE FOR RUSSIA <P> The Red Army 's capture of Rzhev last week freed the 160-mile railway between Velikie Luki and Moscow . Soviet engineers immediately began to broaden the gauge to the Russian size . For the Germans this " axle war " had involved moving the wheels of captured rolling stock slightly toward the center of the axle . The Russians are now having to return the wheels to the ends of the axle .
