The Adventuress ( Rank ; Eagle-Lion ) is a bright comedy-melodrama about an Irish female equivalent of Senator Claghorn . The heroine ( DeborahKerr ) , a guileless , broguish biddy from the backcountry , hardly realizes that Cromwell is dead . She has learned to hate the English with all her heart &; soul , and has learned very little else . So she gets herself involved in World War II as an assistant to some sinister Nazi spies operating in an English village and on the Isle of Man . Eventually , of course , Miss Kerr sees the error of her ways , takes sides with upright Englishman Trevor Howard , and in a fast chain of movie chases , assures the success of the Normandy invasion . <P> Producer-Directors Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat have picked up a good many nimble ideas from Alfred Hitchcock . There is a chilling sequence about a spy trapped in a tunnel ; in another scene , Miss Kerr , trying to dispose of an embarrassing corpse , disguises it as a wheel-chair gaffer and prams it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &-buggy; funeral cortege explodes into a hilarious slow-motion chase . Some of the comedy is better than the melodrama ; some of it just gets in the melodrama 's hair . <P> Deborah Kerr is a pleasure to look at and a pleasure to watch at work ; without her , The Adventuress would be like an egg without salt . But already , in this next-to-last of her English films before Hollywood took her in tow , she has changed noticeably from her earlier roles . Clearly a Star , with an " international " appeal , she already suggests a cross between a junior Greer Garson and a Girl Guide . Students of What Hollywood Does To People will note that a good deal can be done by remote control . <P> Blaze of Noon ( Paramount ) , a movie about men who fly and a woman who watches &; waits , starts off crisply but gets a little soggy as it goes along . It is pleasant enough as long as the four McDonald brothers ( Sonny Tufts , William Holden , Stirling Hayden , Johnny Sands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a pretty circus girl Jean Wallace is rather more than pleasant . It is still all right , for a while , when the McDonalds become pioneers at flying the mail , and such skilled workmen as William Bendix and Howard Da Silva get into the picture . <P> But gradually , as the romance builds up , the story begins to fall apart . Brother Holden marries Anne Baxter . Brother Hayden develops a glum yen for her ; she becomes more &; more nervous about being married to a family of incurable flyers . The picture becomes a kind of waiting game ; every so often another McDonald is shown high in the fog , desperately swabbing his goggles . One by one they leave their profession . One becomes an auto salesman , one is crippled , two are killed . <P> At its weakest , Blaze of Noon never quite becomes an unlikable movie . Messrs . Hayden and Holden are highly personable in their first cinemacting since the war ; Paul Mantz does some good ghost stunting for all four brothers ; and occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dash of professional airmen . The main trouble is the story : not adequate to the emotions it tries to handle , it loses its drive , charm and eventually its shape .
