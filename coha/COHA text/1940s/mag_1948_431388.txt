 | Twinkle , twinkle , little star , How I wonder what you are ! Up above the world so high , Like a diamond in the sky . Scintillate , scintillate , asteroid minific , Fain would I fathom your nature specific ! Loftily poised in the ether capacious , Strongly resembling a gem carbonaceous . One of these days I expect to hear a child , disdainful of the simplicity of " Twinkle , twinkle , " lisp her way through " Scintillate , scintillate . " Why not ? This precocious child will merely be imitating her elders , who so frequently discard the short , vigorous word in favor of the pedantic one . New Yorkers will remember , probably with a shudder , the sign in every store window during the war . Wherever they looked they saw the words , " Illumination is required to be extinguished before these premises are closed to business . " What a twisted mouthful ! The Anglo-Saxon version , " Lights must be put out before the store closes , " is by comparison pure poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a well-known hotel . On each table was a printed card bearing these words : Your committee has provided gratuities covering the menu service . The guest may , however , reflect his pleasure with beverage service through additional offering . " Note that the guest is not allowed to show his pleasure ; he must merely reflect it through additional o Hering ! Another evening I tuned in on the Joe Louis ? Mauriello fight . What did I hear ? This : " And now may the better participant emerge triumphantly ! " This may have been intentional humor , of course , but I suspect it had been drummed into the announcer 's head that " May the best man win " was a cliche and that best is incorrect when there are only two contestants . Also , he did n't know that it 's not easy to emerge triumphantly . That requires acting as well as boxing ability . It 's easier to emerge triumphant  - -  which Joe Louis did , not only in the prize fight but in the battle of words . When asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis said , " Conn was able to run away , but he could n't hide . " There you have it : natural , simple @#  | expression , with a punch . The short and simple words are much more effective than longer words would have been . Many influential groups have taken up the fight for the simple word that comes naturally . In the fall of 1944 , the British War Office issued a special memorandum on the subject . The staff was urged to use " end " instead of " termination , " " help " instead of " facilitate , " and so on . Excellent suggestions , but the official statement asking for the use of simple words ended thus : " Nothing is more conducive to long-winded and stilted writing than the use of formal , pedantic , or polysyllabic substitutes for a natural word or expression . " When Maury Maverick , who coined " gobbledygook " to describe this kind of writing , tackled the same abuses in his bureau at Washington , he was more direct . He wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A memorandum should be as short as clearness will allow . The naval officer who wired , Sighted sub ? sank same ' told the story . . . . Stay off gobbledygook language . . Anyone using the words activation ' or implementation ' will be shot . " The fight has been taken into the meeting halls of the United Nations . At one session the Canadian Minister struck " a blow for liberty in plain English . " He pointed out that clear , simple English does not make a document illegal . He suggested that if something is worth saying it is worth saying simply and directly , so that people can understand it . Even one of our important dictionaries has entered the battle . It has launched an advertising campaign for easy-to-understand definitions , so you wo n't have to look up the definition of a definition . A typical advertisement asks this direct question : " Suppose you were a pelican , how would you like to be called a piscivurous , natatorial vertebrate with a dis:ensible gular pouch ' ? " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why do we throw them about ? Why do so many of us use a pretentious word like " endeavor , " when " try " will do the job more effectively ? It is probably because we mistakenly think the long word is a sign of the educated or cultured mind . It is n't ; often the use of long words may betray a mind short on ideas . An editorial in a New York newspaper went even farther . " It is almost always bad manners , " it stated , " to use a showy , pretentious word when a plain and simple one will serve the purpose better . " THE FIGHT against the pompous word is an old one . It is reported that Oliver Goldsmith once said to Samuel Johnson , who was fond of using long words of Latin origin , " Why , Doctor Johnson , if you were to make little fishes talk , they would talk like whales . " A century later Tennyson came across these lines of Wordsworth 's : And sitting on the grass partook The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , " asked Tennyson , " could he not have said , And sitting on the grass had tea ' ? " Writing in 1867 , William Matthews , a professor of English , tells about the best lesson in rhetoric he ever heard . It was taught by a Maine farmer to a college professor who was passing by . The professor said , " You are excavating a subterranean tunnel , it seems . " " No , sir , " was the farmer 's reply , " I am only dig- I ging a ditch . " Long words do have their place . They belong in philosophical dissertations ( there are two ! ) , in scientific and technical treatises , and in any other kind of writing when the long word is the only one that will convey the precise meaning desired . Most of the time , however , in all kinds of writing , the short word gets you there faster and safer than the long word . As the old verse has it : " Saxon words say what you mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few words on the subject ; five , to be exact : " Brevity is the soul of wit . "
