Great is Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera . But much of its scenery is hideous , most of its stagecraft pompous , hidebound , stodgy . In Europe , opera is everywhere sung in the language of the land , whereas the Met 's official tongue is Anything-but-English . Next week the Metropolitan will open its season with some hurdy-Verdi in Italian ( Un Ballo in Maschera ) , a new sponsor for its Saturday broadcasts ( Texas Co. ) , its annual promise of more oomph . Meanwhile last week some other U. S. operas delivered the oomph . <P> &gt; In Philadelphia 's Academy of Music , the young , hard-working Philadelphia Opera Company hit the stride of its third season with a performance in English of the best-known Czech opera : Bedrich Smetana 's The Bartered Bride . Managed by tall , lean C. David Hocker , musically directed by short , swart Sylvan Levin , the Philadelphia troupe has 22 singers , average age about 27 , all but one homegrown . The simple fooleries of The Bartered Bride , set to simple , polka-dotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luke Matz ( music supervisor in the Unionville , Pa. public school ) , as a jovial village marriage broker ; Soprano Frances Greer ( Philadelphia church singer ) , as the unwilling betrothed of the village simpleton ( Tenor John Toms , voice teacher ) ; Tenor Edward Nyborg ( Philadelphia tailor 's helper ) , as the boy who finally gets the girl . <P> Enemies of opera in English often argue that most translations are bad . For his Bartered Bride Director Levin took a standard translation , freely paraphrased it , so that the marriage broker sang , " I know a honey with lots of money " instead of the conventional translationese , " One I know who has money galore . " <P> &gt; Last week the Chicago Opera was in the middle of its six-week season . This year 's new angel and ardent publicizer : Publisher Robert ( " Bertie " ) McCormick of the Tribune . There were other novel ties . A chorus whose average age was 25 tickled Chicago eyes as well as ears . The Ballet Theatre , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces with the singers . Last fortnight a performance of Carmen got columns of publicity : in the last act 18 Chicago cops , led by Chief of Traffic Captain David Flynn , took turns appearing as Spanish dragoons riding nine police-department horses . <P> Musically , the most notable Chicago operas were two performed last week : Richard Strauss ' s Salome , blazingly conducted by Artur Rodzinski ; and the best of modern Italian works , The Love of Three Kings , conducted by its Composer Italo Montemezzi . Best opera in English was Verdi 's Falstaff , retranslated from the Italian to sound something like Shakespeare . Baritone John Charles Thomas patterned his make-up from a Falstaff beer advertisement , said " Falstaff is just a plain red-nosed comedian to me , " acted that way . He got one of his laughs by singing , right out , " Go to hell ! "
