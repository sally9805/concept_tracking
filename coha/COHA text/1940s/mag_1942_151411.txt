To its own sports staff and later to all members ' editors , A.P . last week dispatched a grave memo : <P> " . . . There should be a ban on flowery , overenthusiastic lyrical sports writing for the duration . . . . Remembering the exploits of military heroes , it does not seem appropriate to overdo the use of such words as ' courageous , ' ' gallant , ' ' fighting ' . ... It does n't take much ' courage ' to overcome a two-run lead in the ninth . . . . " <P> Other more important signs of war 's pinch in the press : <P> &gt; Comics are rapidly shrinking from five to four columns , with many a comic and Sunday magazine section due to go tabloid . <P> &gt; Many sports sections are being cut in size . ( Example : The New York Herald Tribune is down about three columns from a year ago . ) <P> &gt; Though newsprint ( pegged at $50 a ton ) is still plentiful , newspapers , take nothing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely come in the fall , when new Canadian aluminum and chemical plants may need the electric power formerly used in newsprint manufacture . <P> Biggest newspaper problem of the moment , however , is ODT 's order , effective June 1 , that newspapers limit local deliveries to one a day , in order to save rubber and gasoline . In big cities , where newsstands account for a majority of circulation , publishers have complained that one edition a day would ruin them . They suggest pooling trucks , abolishing " returns , " printing fewer editions but more than one . They claim their plan would ' save more mileage than the Government 's . <P> Triumphantly the New York Daily News made capital of curtailment on deliveries . In nearly two pages of text and pictures it gloated over newly acquired horses and wagons ( " seventy oat-burners and their equipage , rubberless and gasless from nose to tail-board " ) . The News has frequently growsed about the ineptitudes of rubber and gas rationing . But last week the horse- &-buggy; News was almost good humored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse learns the turns and stops , and the driver just pitches the bundles off . "
