London audiences have packed Albert Hall nine times this season to hear Pianist Eileen Joyce . One thing they like about her is her showmanship . Tall , green-eyed Pianist Joyce makes the most of her looks by frequent changes of dress and hairdo between numbers ( " Sequins for Debussy , " she once explained deadpan to a reporter , " red and gold for Schumann ; hair up for Beethoven , down for Grieg " ) . <P> The critics may grumble about Eileen 's dressy monkeyshines-but they also think that her playing is in Myra Hess 's league . U.S. audiences have not yet seen Eileen 's act , but millions of moviegoers have heard her ( the excellent sound tracks of Rachmaninoff 's Concerto No. 2 helped make The Seventh Veil and Brief Encounter two of the best British movies seen in the U.S. ) . <P> Last week Pianist Joyce was far from her new fans . She had gone back home to give a charity concert in the Australian mining town of Boulder , " where my father slaved and died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a red-haired gamin who used to wheeze out Cherry Ripe on a mouth organ for pennies outside of Boulder 's Angel Bar . <P> Lilac for Liszt . Eileen gave her audience of prosperous , dressed-up miners the works . She recalled her father 's rebuke when she returned from Europe once before , full of Beethoven concertos . When she was unable to play his favorite Believe Me , If All Those Endearing Young Charms , he had muttered " All your schoolin 's bin wasted . " This time , in Boulder 's city hall , she gave them , among other things , Liebestraum , the " Moonlight " <P> Sonata and Chopin waltzes . As usual , she put on a good show by changing dresses three times ( lilac for Liszt , black for Bach , green for Chopin ) . Her encore , Home , Sweet Home , had them stamping their feet . <P> Eileen is not quite sure how old she is , because her illiterate miner father never registered her birth . She guesses that she is mid-thirty-ish , celebrates her birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excuse for presents and a quiet party . " <P> A war widow with an 8-year-old child , Eileen is now married to her London agent . She first won notice in England with her records ; but the English really warmed up to her when she made wartime tours . Now her records ( for English Decca and English Columbia ) are snapped up as fast as she makes them . <P> Break for a Girl . Eileen has not forgotten how she got her start . Years ago , when she was in a Perth convent , a priest brought Composer-Pianist Percy Grainger to hear her play . Grainger , in turn , fetched the great German Pianist Wilhelm Back-haus , who was touring Australia . When Backhaus said that she must go to Leipzig to study , the miners passed the hat to send her . Now Eileen is looking around for another talented Australian girl who needs help . Says she : " This is a man 's world , and a girl needs every break . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
