In Philadelphia last fortnight a 13-year-old Finn , looking too tall for his bare knees and short pants , listened to Eugene Ormandy rehearsing the Philadelphia Orchestra in Jean Sibelius ' surging Finlandia . Much moved , Finn Heimo Haitto ( pronounced hay-moe high-toe ) sat down and wrote his good friend Sibelius all about it . Last week the boy had more to tell the old composer . Again bare-kneed , and sailorcollared , Heimo Haitto tucked a Guarnerius fiddle under his beardless chin , made his bigtime U. S. debut with Ormandy and the orchestra in the plushy Academy of Music . Critics liked his easy , self-assured playing , could well believe that Sibelius had said of him : " This youngster will carry on the tradition of Finnish music . " <P> Heimo Haitto was born in Viipuri ( since last month Viborg , Russia ) , began fiddling at four . When he was nine his parents put him in the Viipuri Conservatory , later let him be adopted by the Conservatory 's founder , Boris Sirpo .

Back in Viipuri , Violinist Haitto was walking to school one day when he heard an air-raid alarm . He rushed home , grabbed what he thought was his Guarnerius , headed for shelter . When the raid was over , the Sirpo home and the Conservatory were wrecked , and Heimo Haitto discovered that , in his excitement , he had saved a cheap violin . The Sirpos and their foster child headed for Sweden and Norway , where Heimo fiddled at benefit concerts for the Finnish Red Cross . Then they sailed for the U.

He has learned some English , likes U. S. oranges , Mickey Rooney , skating in Manhattan 's Rockefeller Center rink .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
