One night during the Quebec Conference , Jean Marie Rodrigue , Cardinal Villeneuve , Archbishop of Quebec , had dined with President Franklin Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill . Thereupon he canceled a projected trip to Mexico . A big Lancaster bomber flew him from Montreal to Britain ( it was the first plane trip of his 60 years and he loved it ) . In London he stayed in a darkly elegant house behind Westminster Cathedral as the guest of Archbishop Bernard Griffin , called briefly on Canadian High Commissioner Vincent Massey and other officials . He had an audience with King George VI . <P> He visited Canadian servicemen in camps and hospitals . He praised 1,200 Canadian troops in Westminster Cathedral for their " heroic courage . " Of Britain , which he had not seen since war began , the Cardinal said : " One has to see with one 's own eyes to believe and to measure the dreadful effects of war and also to appreciate the . . . incomparable endurance of Britons . " <P> Then he was off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , he lived at the maison mere of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate ( he is a member of the Order ) near the Colosseum . The purpose of his trip , he said , was merely to visit Canadian troops , report to the Pope , as every bishop is required to do periodically . <P> Many thought the Cardinal 's trip had a larger , undisclosed purpose . Was Cardinal Villeneuve carrying a message to Pius XII from Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill ? Cried the Vatican : " Fantastic ! " But observers noted that when Cardinal Villeneuve went in for his hour 's talk with the Pope , he carried a bulky envelope sealed with five wax seals . He came out without it .
