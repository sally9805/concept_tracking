With virtuous vigor Franklin Roosevelt last week vetoed a $320,000,000 defense-highway appropriation bill . Reason : he had asked for only $125,000,000 to correct critical deficiencies in the strategic network of military highways ; pork-hungry Congress had blown up the measure ; worse , had changed the bill 's idea . The $320,000,000 was not to be distributed according to defense needs but by the hoary Federal-aid formula - based on population , area , etc . The Senate happily overrode the President 's veto , 57-to-19 , well over the required two-thirds majority . The House just barely upheld the President by what amounted to a mistake : the overconfident pork-lovers got two votes less than the required two-thirds . The President was vindicated : no pork in defense highways . <P> Next day the scene shifted to the House Rivers &; Harbors Committee , the traditional headquarters for Congressional pork-lovers . The headquarters has lately seen lean times ; all the fat cuts have gone to the military and naval committees . Moodily the committee contemplated a project of which it is suspicious : the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee had stalled , still was far from a decision . Then the President suddenly wrote a friendly letter to Chairman Joseph Jefferson Mansfield , saying he would not oppose including the Seaway in an omnibus appropriation bill . This was the signal the wolves were waiting for ; the door to the icebox was flung open . All of the Presidentially refrigerated cuts of pork were dragged from the hooks , even the long-dead $197,000,000 Florida Ship Canal . The smell of pork was rich over the Capitol .
