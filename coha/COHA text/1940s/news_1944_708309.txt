COOPER Plans for new public housing here to cost $260,000,000 , designed to clear away vast areas of New York 's slums and provide modern living quarters for at least 36,753 additional low-income families in the first three years after the war , have been drawn up by the New York City Housing Authority , it became known last night . Edmond B. Butler , chairman of the Housing Authority , confirmed the report that the city agency had just presented a $132,500,000 program for sixteen additional Federally aided projects to John A. Kervick , regional head of the Federal Public Housing Authority here , as a basis for New York 's share in the forthcoming request by FPHA. to Congress for a new allotment of housing loan funds . This new Federal-aid program In the city would embrace sixteen projects not heretofore announced , to accommodate at least 19,300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other Projects Plans have been completed for eleven other projects for 15,482 families , with $115,000,000 in State housing loan funds already available . The three-year post-war construction program of the Authority also includes Jacob Riis Houses , an $8,500,000 home center for at least 1,354 families on the lower East Side of Manhattan , for which Federal money already has been allotted and the site acquired ; and Elliott City Houses , a $3,860 , - 000 project for 617 families in the Chelsea area , to be financed through the city 's occupancy tax . The program also will involve extensions to Vladeck Federal Houses on the lower East Side , South Jamaica Houses in Queens and Kingsborough Houses in Brooklyn . Architectural plans already have been drawn or are in preparation for nearly half of this over-all program , including most of the Stateaided housing , and several of the sites have been acquired , so that the city will be able to proceed promptly with much of the work when materials are released , and provide employment for thousands when peace comes . There is a possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units and that some additional projects may be undertaken if Federal , State or city funds are made available , Mr. Butler revealed . With existing public housing , New York will have accommodations in its low-rent homes for at // least 53,793 families when the program as it now stands is completed , according to figures verified by the Authority . The fourteen units now in operation accommodate 17,040 families and have a total resident population of 58,500 . They were erected at a cost of $90,500,000 . The 36,753 additional housing units now contemplated will provide in a threeyear period more than twice as many units as have been erected in the city since the Housing Authority was created a decade ago . They will increase the total resident city housing population by about 126,150 , bringing it to 184,650 . Ground Lost During War " New York has lost ground during the war in its effort to remove substandard buildings and provide decent homes for worthy families , and it is our hope to be prepared to regain some of this ground as soon . as restrictions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We are planning all this new work with the aim of keeping below a rental limit of $7 a room monthly on all projects , with some considerably lower , and hope to get back to the average of $6 a room monthly on Federal loan projects . The cost of land , even in Manhattan slums , is one problem in keeping rentals and subsidies down , and this cost and the type of construction necessary in this section of the country naturally will run the building unit cost higher than in some of the smaller places and in Southern cities . " The $7 limit , however , will be well below the $12.50 monthly rent charge in limited-divided projects financed by private capital , and leaves a wide gap which will refute any argument of competition with any private housing except the outmoded buildings in the slums . It also leaves a gap which should be a challenge to private enterprise and ingenuity , which will have free rein to meet the inbetween need . " The $132,500,000 Housing Authority program just presented to the FPHA involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five in Brooklyn , two in Queens and one on Staten Island . Although the boundaries for most of these building groups have been fixed tentatively , the exact sites will not ' be announced until later to prevent speculative buying or other problems connected with acquisition of the land later by the Authority . One project in east Harlem is to provide 1,700 family units , another on the upper East Side at the edge of east Harlem calls for 1,300 units , and still another in the heart of Harlem involves 2,300 units . A new home center on the lower East Side will offer 1,860 apartments , and the extension of Vladeck Federal Houses will give 900 more dwelling units . These , together with Jacob Rfis Houses for 1,354 or more families , the city-financed Elliott Houses , and five new State-aided projects in Manhattan , will give this bor ' ough 17,393 new low-rent units , or more than are now provided in the city as a whole . The five new State-aided Manhattan projects on the books for construction immediately after the war are Amsterdam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wald Houses , on the lower East Side , 1,805 units ; Abraham Lincoln Houses , in Harlem , 1,289 units ; James Weldon Johnson Houses , also In Harlem , 1,320 apartments , and Governor Smith Houses on the lower East Side , 1,924 units . There are to be no stores in any of these post-war projects , the Authority having decided on the basis of its past experience to leave to adjoining private property owners the job of supplying adequate neighborhood retail shopping facilities .
