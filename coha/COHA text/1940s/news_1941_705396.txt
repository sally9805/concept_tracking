Faced with demands for the appointment of a new Congressional committee to investigate the nation 's rearmament program , Representative May of Kentucky , Military Affairs chairman , interrupted today 's debate to say that his committee started a special investigation three weeks ago and already had discovered several " mistakes " in the Army program . Though nothing had been disclosed by the inquiry so far to justify indictments , Democratic members of the committee said that they I had already amended the original system of letting army contracts on " the cost-plus-fee " basis , reduced from 61A per cent to 31/ per cent the fee for acquiring land for the Army and questioned engineers on projects where irregularities have been reported . Members of the committee , it was disclosed , were planning to investigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today 's debate in the House was sharp , but the Appropriation Bill , which was approved by the Appropriations Committee this morning , is expected to pass tomorrow . Republicans are not opposing the measure but are trying to force the Administration to accept an amendment that would bar unions from demanding the closed shop on all defense projects . The $1,533,439,702 bill provides $695,118,000 for the Army , most of which will be used to complete the training camp construction program and expand the Army air arm , and $838,321,702 for the Navy . Shore bases , including the eight Atlantic sites acquired from Great Britain as well as expansion of naval bases at Guam and Samoa in the Pacific , received $169,415,000 in the naval appropriation . Another cash grant of $96,382,300 , plus a contract authorization of $30,000,000 , was included , mainly for the purchase of 189 planes , which will bring the Navy 's air arm up to about 7,318 planes by the first of July . In addition to these stipulations , a fund of $202,000,000 was provided for replacement of naval vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold R. Stark said that despite this large request for naval vessels , battleship and destroyer construction in this country is running between four and six months ahead of schedule . Rear Admiral Samuel M. Robinson , chief of the Bureau of Ships , testified before the committee that 55 new destroyers would be delivered by Dec. 31 , 1943 . Admiral Stark added that in his opinion the transfer of further destroyers to Great Britain would not be in order " at the minute . " Despite the Administration 's battery of experts , Republicans criticized the Administration as showing lack of planning and careful supervision of the defense program . Representative Taber of New York said that there had been " all sorts of racketeering " in the Army building program and no anticipation on the part of the Army officials . Taber Scores Land Purchasing He was especially critical of the Army 's land purchases . In Missouri , he said , a Kansas City real estate dealer , employed by the government to purchase land , paid $140 to $400 an acre . Altogether , Mr. Taber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and received a 5 per cent commission of $126,000 . A $40,000 fee , the Representative said , was paid to trace the titles to the land . Likewise , he said , $3,000,000 was paid by the army for 60,000 acres in Indiana and the broker in that deal received 61 , E per cent , or $195,000 . Mr. Taber , like other members on both sides of the House , absolved Brig . Gen. Brehon B. Somervell , chief of Army construction , of blame in these transactions . They ' had taken place , he said , before General Somervell was directing the construction program . Time and again during the debate , Republican members accused labor leaders of " racketeering . " To get a job on defense projects , they said , men had to pay union fees . The opposition made it clear that they had every intention of fighting for an amendment which would demand the open shop on all essential defense projects . Army Camp Costs Criticized Criticism of the War Department in particular and the financial and administrative policy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an additional $338,880,000 to complete construction of Army camps . Demanding an explanation of this request , Republican members said that on most contracts undertaken by the War Department the actual cost would be 50 to 85 per cent more than the original estimate . Administration leaders said that 25 or 30 per cent of the extra cost of constructing the bases was due to the rising cost of the wages and materials , 15 to 25 per cent to changes in the plans of the service departments and 50 to 60 per cent to additional work undertaken since the estimates were made . Reminding members that the bill concerned 186 different projects in different parts of the country for housing and training an army of 1.418,000 men , Democrats urged the opposition not to give the country the impression that the entire program was bogging down and praised the work of General Somerveil , who had nothing to do with the original estimates . General Marshall is Quoted Democrats quoted testimony given before the Appropriations Committee by General George C. Marshall , Chief of Staff , to support their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program could not have been avoided . When the Administration began drafting this program less than a year ago , General Marshall told the committee , the United States would have been in " a somewhat helpless plight " had control of the Atlantic , Ocean " passed to an enemy . " It was necessary to build and build fast , he said . The collapse of France changed the entire picture for the War Department . " Frankly , " he told the commit tee , " we had not anticipated that the American people would ever be sufficiently aroused to authorize in time of peace such a tremendous program for the national defense , nor had we anticipated the com plete collapse of the French Government in early June , along with the deadly hazard to the British of a transfer of French naval powers to Germany and Italy . " Furthermore , he testified , as the information about the astonishing success of the German Army in the Flanders campaign sifted in from United States military attaches abroad , new decisions had to be made which changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these numerous changes , " he said , " did not percolate throughout our organization in time to affect , as they should have , the basic plans as to the distribution of buildings , types and numbers . Therefore , the men working on the detailed estimates could not realize the new requirements resulting from the changes which produced a much greater degree of motorization and mechanization and more numerous heavy weapons within the infantry organization .
