One day last April , copper-cheeked Margarito Castro planted corn on his hillside acre near Guatemala 's volcano-ringed Lake Atitln and prayed to the Virgin and a host of saints that rain might be plentiful and the harvest good . One morning last fortnight , after a plentiful harvest , Castro loaded the first quintal ( 100 lbs. ) of corn into a dugout canoe and , with his two eldest sons , paddled across the deep-blue lake to the market in Panajachel . <P> A steady rain was falling when Castro awoke in Panajachel the next morning , and he decided to stay on another day . Twenty-four hours later there was still no letup , and streams on either side of Panajachel were swollen . Castro went to church to pray that the rains might stop . All that night torrents fell , and Castro trembled with fear that his cornpatch might be washed into the lake or buried by landslides from the mountains . Next morning he joined the village elders as they dressed an image of San Francisco in a raincoat and paraded it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's salvation . Half an hour after the procession , the rains stopped . <P> But the end of the deluge came too late for Castro and thousands of others like him . When Castro got back to his hillside , he found his wife methodically collecting straw for adobe bricks . His house had dissolved , his cornpatch was gutted , his pig and ox had strayed or drowned . Last week , as the first adobe bricks for his new house were drying in the sun , he and his family hunched round an open fire eating fresh-water crabs from Lake Atitln . But there were no tortillas . Corn could not be bought at any price . <P> Castro and his family had at least survived . In Guatemala City , government officials estimated the dead in the rains and floods at 4,000 . Red Cross Official Edward Russell , who led a U.S. relief party from Panama , thought 500 more likely . At least 20,000 were homeless . <P> Roads , railroads , bridges , herds , and banana and coffee crops had suffered perhaps $25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn that would bring greatest hardship . For months to come , almost all corn would have to be imported .
