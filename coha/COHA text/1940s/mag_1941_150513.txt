Youngest Senator Sirs : <P> TIME for April 28 had this : " Engaged . Rush Dew Holt , 35 , West Virginia 's isolationist junior Senator from 1935 to 1941 ( youngest ever elected ) ; and Helen Froelich , 26 , teacher at National Park Seminary near Washington . " <P> I read this aloud to my old friend , E. E. Patton , the great scholar and educator , in his office at Knoxville , Tenn . This was his reply from memory : <P> " The record shows that Holt lacked only about six months of being old enough to take the oath as a Senator when he was elected . John H. Eaton , a Senator from Tennessee , was born on June 18 , 1790 ; went to the Senate on Sept. 5 , 1818 . This shows that he went to the Senate when he was almost two years under the constitutional age of 30 .

San Francisco , Calif . <P> &gt;TIME was technically correct in calling Rush Holt the youngest man ever " elected " to the Senate , but Reader Wallen 's old friend is right in declaring John Henry Eaton-appointed to a seat in 1818-the youngest man ever to hold a Senate seat . <P> In Washington , Eaton became acquainted-too well acquainted , some said-with Peggy O'Neale , daughter of an innkeeper , whose first husband apparently committed suicide while on naval duty in the Mediterranean . Partly to quiet gossip , Eaton married the " Gorgeous Hussy " in 1829 . When President Andrew Jackson appointed Eaton Secretary of War , the furor of Washington society over Eaton 's wife was such that the President 's Cabinet fell apart . Later Eaton became Governor of Florida and Minister to Spain . After his death Peggy married an Italian dancing master who stole her money and eloped with her granddaughter . Her old age was desolate .

A relatively unknown , but very expressive poet , named Edmund Clarence Stedman said once : <P> Not thou , not thou-'tis we <P> Are deaf , are dumb , are blind ! <P> That is what you are trying to make us " ungullible " Americans believe-that we are blind . Alas , dear editor of a forthright but unrepresentative periodical , it is you who are blind . It is you who can not see that the real Americans that count ( not the 10% who cheer the flags waving in the newsreels ) can not in any way condone convoying ships to Britain , using our Navy for protecting somebody else 's welfare , or getting us into the war . . . . <P> JOHN A.
