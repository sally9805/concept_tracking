HILAIRE AND THE MARECHAL PETARD A STORY BY KAY BOYLE A THAT time in France , say in the first six months or so that followed what happened , every caf ? table in the Unoccupied Zone became a sort of refuge , People who had never set eye on one another before would find themselves sitting down in cafe 's and looking into one an-other 's faces for the answer , not understanding yet how it had happened or why it had happened , but only that they shared a disastrous fate in common , and that was the fate of sudden and incredible defeat . They would tell the story of their own experiences , or the experiences of friends , or merely of people they had heard about somewhere , as if in saying these things over and over they must somehow find the explanation in the end . If they sat silent it was not because they reflected  --  for there are times in a country 's history when its people no longer have the courage to reflect on how tragically the national land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice of the still unheard expositor to find the arguments and speak them out . Perhaps it was this role that young Count Alain filled when he sat down with the peasants in the bistro of the mountain village he had come to , sitting there drinking pinard with them as probably no Count had ever done before . He was articulation , he was almost authority to them as he sat there talking of Flanders and what he had seen and the way things had been . He told them that every army officer was still in the service of his country , and he said it so quietly and deliberately that none of them sought to question it or even to ask what it meant . Perhaps he was saying they would all put their uniforms on again before too long and go on with the fight , or else that every French officer , whatever clothes he wore , was still on some singularly honorable mission ; but because they were not yet at ease in the role of the conquered , they did not ask if it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . He would sit there talking over a glass of wine at night , listening to the news bulletins with them and to what they had to say . If he seemed to pay particular heed to what they said among themselves , as if giving ear to which way the wind of opinion was blowing , they did not notice . To them , the depths of betrayal had already been reached and they did not know how far there was yet to go . If anything passed their lips in violence and impatience the Count was there to speak out and recall them from the dream . He would summon them back to reality , however grim its face was , saying : " We must listen to our leader , " and after a while the peasants themselves would say it : " 11 faut &outer; noire chef , " the sound of it bringing some semblance of peace and quiet for a little while to the soul 's bewilderment and the soul 's despair . He told them all he had come up here for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the long legs and the narrow HILAIRE AND THE waist and the rather slouching back and shoulders  --  and he seemed a rich enough young man although he was a refugee . They knew his French army officer 's uniform was hanging in the closet of his hotel room because he had worn it when he stepped off the bus among them , and he told them he was here because there were Germans billeted in his mother 's property in Brittany . The Germans were exceedingly correct , he said , there was not a breath of criticism against them , but while they were in his mother 's home he preferred to stay at a distance . And when a peasant sitting there with him would clear his throat and wipe the wine off his mustaches with the back of his hand and say : " Ils suet deux four , ce Hitler et le Fureur , " he would not correct him , and he would be careful not even to smile . He talked of Flanders to them , and they could see the horses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  running amok under the bombs and the whining planes with the ancient cannon they could n't get loose from crashing this way and that behind them as they bolted . They could see the road quite well where , he said , the four horscs went galloping in terror to their death , not killed by gunfire this time but by the cannon they were harnessed to outstripping them as they swung wildly abreast and foaming down the hill . " It rammed the four of them into the bridge 's parapet at the bottom , " the Count would say , and the peasants sitting at the table with him would see the way their necks had been broken , and they would shake their heads in outrage over so much horseflesh canceled out either for plowing or carting or for the work that was to be done . " Horse-drawn cannon ! " the Count would go on saying . " Horse-drawn cannon in a 1940 war , " and as he said it the mountain men who had not been there would see for a moment the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there talking to them like this the night the American woman walked in with the little boy just behind her . It was October , and it had been raining . The bistro keeper , leaning on the bar , had said there would probably be snow on the heights by morning when Susan Farrow pushed the caf ? door open and walked in . As soon as Count Alain saw her he stood up and slid his glass of wine back with his fingertips across the table . Why he stood up he could not explain to himself later ; perhaps the sight , as startling there and at that moment as the American Field Service uniform she wore , or perhaps the automatic sign made just once more after a number of years of giving homage to pretty women ; or perhaps it was nothing more than the look of weariness moving him as he faced the stern , young , intrepid eye . She asked if there was a hotel in the town , looking from one to the other of them , and it was the Count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said there was a hotel just across the village square , and he stepped forward as he spoke , saying the words in English to her . " And there are rooms free ? " she said quietly . " There are rooms and actually food to be had ? " The Count said that he was the only guest at the hotel because of the season , and that the food was ample . " Milk , butter , eggs ? You mean things like that ? " she asked , and the little boy beside her looked as well into the Count 's face as if asking corroboration of something as fabulous as Santa Claus . " Yes , " said the Count , smiling , " of course there are , that is if you do n't say their names too loud . " " How loud ? " asked the little boy sternly . " How loud can we say it ? " " Not very loud , " said Count Alain , and without warning the little boy suddenly called : " Milk  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure , ringing voice across the room , and the Count burst out laughing . The mother put her hand on the back of the nearest chair , and the Count saw something falter in her . " I 've driven a long way , " she said . She looked in some sort of numb confusion at the Count and at the other men . " I think I need a drink , " she said . Count Alain jumped to hold the chair and he ordered the drink for her , and when he asked if he could sit down at the table with her she made a brief gesture with her hand . " Where did they stop you ? " the Count asked , sitting there looking at her . Because since June that was the way the questions would begin , she understood and said it had happened at Evreux . " I had three wounded in my ambulance , " she said as she stripped her gloves off . " My base hospital had evacuated , so when I went I took my wounded along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fontainebleau , and he rode on the driver 's scat beside me . We managed to get our wounded through alive , " she said . Her hair was soft and longish under the cap , and her mouth was young , and in the bistro 's uncertain light she looked scarcely more than a girl to the Count , but he knew from the eyes ' clear , cool implacability that she could have done this thing or anything else she might have set out to do . " We were bombed pretty regularly , " she said , and as if there was little to it , she added : " It took us over a week to reach Bordeaux . " " I wish I had seen you there , " said the Count across the table . " I was there too . " " Perhaps you did see me , " said Susan Farrow , and she took another drink from her glass . " I was the woman who made a spectacle of herself the day the Germans came . Perhaps you saw them drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging like trophies of the hunt on the radiators of their cars ? " she said . " I could n't stand it . I stood there by the fountain and cried like a fool . " " The English Tommies ' caps were n't much to look at at Dunkerque , " the Count said , looking at her , and Susan Farrow lighted her own cigarette and threw the match away . MAGAZINE " Whether you liked them then or not , " she said , " if you 're still a Frenchman you 've got to like them now . " She looked him in the eye a moment and then she said : " Why did n't you get across from Bordeaux ? " " Across ? " said the Count , pretending not to understand it . He turned his glass in his fingers a moment . " I went there to try to find out what there was still left for a French officer to do , " he said , and he did not lift his eyes . " And having found out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Susan Farrow , " what in the world are you doing here ? " The Count did not speak at once , and when he did it was not to answer her question . He turned to the little boy with a smile and he asked him if he 'd like another grenadine , his tone almost wilfully playful and light , and then he looked at the mother again . , " In all the panic and stampede of those first days , " he said , " I should have loved to meet you walking coolly down a Bordeaux street . " " Not so coolly , " said Susan Farrow . " I was also that woman who got up and left a cafe terrace one afternoon because German officers sat down at the table next to her . I did n't like the look of the enemy even then , " she said , with the little edge of grimness on her voice , and the Count 's eyes shifted a tittle . " You sound like a Frenchwoman , " he said pleasantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My husband 's French , " she said , and the Count 's eyes returned with interest to her face . She had lifted her glass , and he saw again the first thing that had moved him in her  --  the Iook of desperate weariness or of desperate , valiant grief halted just this side of despair . " I hope you have good news of him , " Count Alain said and he watched her carefully as he spoke . Susan Farrow put her glass down and looked at the little circle of liquid that remained . " I have no news , " she said . " I 've been waiting for news since June . " HILAIRE AND THE That was the first night , and the snow had not fallen yet , but all the next day there was the feel of it in the air . Count Alain played Russian billiards by himself in the entrance hall of the hotel and waited , or else he walked up and down in the village square where the church was and smoked cigarettes and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bored , in spite of the mission he had undertaken . There were no books here , no women , no life except this life of keeping watch upon other men 's emotions . There was no snow even . He remembered a book he had read in London one spring , an English book or an Irish book , and the name of it was unpleasant to him . The Informer it was called , and he put the word into French as he chalked his cue . " Le Mouchard , " he said and he did n't like the taste of it . All that day he might have been waiting for the snow to fall or for the American woman and her little boy to come downstairs together , but neither one thing nor the other happened . It was not until nearly five in the afternoon that the little boy came down alone and stopped at the bottom of the stairs . " I 'm glad to see you , " said the Count . " I hope you 'll have a game with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cues , and he said he 'd been hoping for company all day . The little boy wore ski-trousers and a navy sweater too short for him , with the elbows of it darned . " I do n't know how to play , " he said , and he stood looking at the billiard table . " Did n't your father ever play billiards with you ? " the Count asked casually enough , and the little boy said he had n't . He drew one finger slowly and carefully down the length of the table in the red wood 's groove . " Maybe I was too young to learn be-fore he went away . I was only nine then . That was a year ago , " he said . " So he went away , " said the Count , shooting the first ball . " You mean he left the country , he left France ? " he said , still in that casual , easy way . " Yes , he left France , " the little boy said , watching the balls . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weygand . " The Count straightened up and looked at the billiard table in speculation a moment and then he placed the stick in the boy 's two hands . He turned his shoulders for him and arranged his fingers so that the cue might rest easily in them , and he said : " Well , now the war 's over , " and he steadied the boy 's hand , standing behind him as a father might have done . " Make your arm a little looser , " he said , and he went on saying : " For Frenchmen the war 's over . You know that , do n't you ? Now let it go , " he said about the cue . It wobbled uncertainly forward and the tip of it seemed to rise of itself into the air and it missed the white ball by three inches . " Try it again , " said the Count . " That one does n't count , " and he guided the cue back through the little boy 's hands . " The war 's over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The little boy pulled the cue back and let it go again , and this time he hit the white ball squarely and it cracked into the red . " I hit it , " said the little boy . " That was a good one , " said the Count , and he walked around the table for position . " When your father comes up here you can show him how to do it . " " I 'm saving my sugar to give him , " the little boy said . It was not until the next morning that the mother was to be seen , and then she came downstairs early with the little boy walking beside her , freshly groomed and the shabby clothes he wore quite clean . The Count could see her from the hotel dining room where he sat drinking his cafe national with a little skimmed milk in it and eating his one slice of unbuttered bread . She was wearing the uniform still  --  probably only for the warmth of it by this time , or because she had nothing else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft hair floating . She took the little boy across the square , and the Count watched them mount the length of the village street to where the school was and he saw them go inside the schoolhouse door . When she came out the Count was on the square lighting his first cigarette , and he saw she was alone now . She had put her hands in her jacket pockets and she did not look back at the schoolhouse windows as she went quickly up the road . Count Alain caught up with her just before the corner where the road turned off into the cart track , and he said good-morning to her , and mentioned the weather , doing it  --  as he had done before ? in English , and doing it well . He was wearing his military boots , and the honorary bit of bright red silk was threaded in his jacket 's lapel , and he walked with a certain , flattering intimacy beside her . " So school , " he said as they started to climb from the village towards where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to go , " said Susan Farrow , and her voice was a little uneasy . " I did n't want to leave him . This year it means going back and trying to be a little boy again , " she said , and the Count liked the sound of her voice as they walked together . " It means ceasing to be a witness to all the grimes he has seen committed . He 's seen too many of them since June . " " You mean  --  death ? " said the Count , and he cleared his throat , watching the well-turned toes of his military boots appearing , first the right and then the left , as they mounted the frost-stiff , rutted soil . " Hunger and violence  --  different kinds of violence . And death  --  yes , death , " said Susan Farrow . All about them was the dour , stone-gray landscape with the islands of needle-trees dark and rich as velvet on it . High against the lightish , clouded heavens , the everlasting snows lay a brilliant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuns on bicycles who pedaled half a day before us down the bombarded road , " she said . " He has to forget about them : the two of them lying dead after the bomb , and the third one , with a hand gone , trying to pick up her rosary beads that were scattered all over what was left of the road . He remembers everything . He remembers she did n't even know her hand was gone , " she said . " Perhaps America , " the Count murmured , looking at his shoes as he walked . " I ca n't leave until I have news , " said Susan Farrow . " I 'm going to wait here until I know about my husband . " They walked on in silence a moment and then the Count said : " Of course no fighting took place in Syria . " " Yes , " said Susan Farrow . " I know . " " And if there had been an accident the authorities would have advised you , " said Count Alain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . " The Count glanced at the side of her face as they climbed , seeing almost in spite of himself the clarity and the color of it laid startling as a flower against the sapless and lifeless , stony land . " Perhaps you have reason to believe he is trying to get to another country ? " he said , but her face gave no sign . " I 'm not certain geography can alter what has happened , " she said , and at the same instant they saw the little animal flash across the land before them . " White ! Is it an ermine ? " she cried out , and the Count answered with satisfaction : " When the weasels turn white it means the snow is n't far . " It may have been then , as they walked up the country , that she first told him the parable of the dream . That was October , and de Gaulle had already tried to land at Dakar and failed , and the Tchad was flying the Free French flag on its military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first mentioned the dream to him . She may have said that , whatever was lost , the dream still remained to be given ; or that it was the dream he could still give to the peasants instead of what he gave , and the Count had cried out in irritation : HILAIRE AND THE " The dream ? What dream ? What dream ? " and he could feel the vicious pain of indecision turning in his heart . Another time that she spoke of it was the afternoon when the Count took them both out from the other side of the village to eat the homemade bread and honey on the hill . School was over for the day , and the snow had not begun to fall yet , and the weasels were still running pure white across the land . The mother and the Count and the little boy followed up the deep cold gully where the waters poured swiftly over the frost-sprayed rocks and the mosses ' bleached hair , and the water fell so deeply and loudly that , even though they were close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heard above its clamor . " We 're going to eat honey , honey ! " the little boy tried calling out , but the sound of the falling water engulfed his voice and carried it downstream beneath the ice-bearded trees . But once they had rounded the highest boulder of land it was as if they had clapped their hands to their ears ; for here the tumult of the water died first to a whisper and then abruptly ceased to be . Here the ski-jump was erected at the summit where they paused , and the needle-trees stood frail and tall and delicately boughed about them . Just across the barren , ice-bound plateau they could see the one farm lying straight ahead . " That 's the honey farm , " said Count Alain , and he ran lightly up the ski-jump 's boards . He had turned his back on the distant farm , and he stood looking down the jump 's swift , sloped avenue of leaves . " Here 's where the jumpers start sliding , " he said , and the little boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you take a little drink for courage , and then you put your legs together and you close your eyes . " The little boy stood to one side watching him do it . " And then what do you do ? What do you do after that ? " he said . " And then you say a prayer , " said Count Alain . " You ask for strength in the name of Travail , Famille , Paine . ' " " You do if you 're a collaborationist , " said Susan Farrow quickly . " If you 're still a Frenchman you ask for strength in the name of Liberte , Egalite ' , Fraternire , ' " and then the little boy said the thing that neither of them had been expecting to hear . As if it had been he instead of the peasants who sat each night in the bistro listening to Count Alain , the little boy said : " We must listen to our leader , " speaking the words in terrible mimicry . " Do n't say it like that ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . " I forbid you to say it like that ! " he said . His face was white , and as he came across the rotted pine cones and the stones of the path to where the little boy stood there was something they had not seen before as cold as iron in his eyes . " Do you know what you 're saying ? " he said , and in another moment it seemed he might lift his hand in fury and strike the little boy . " I 'm saying what everybody at school 's saying , " said the little boy . " Not like that ! " said the Count . " That is n't the way we say it ! " " It 's the way we say it at school , and the way everybody says it . The teachers say it like that , and the bus-driver said it like that , and the postman , and everybody says it like that , " the little boy said . " II fact e'couter noire malheureux chef , le ga-ga de Vichy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too-small navy sweater and his ski pants , looking Count Alain stubbornly in the eye . The silence that fell upon them now had nothing to do with the height of the place or the mere cessation of sound . But it was this other thing , the rift between reality and the dream that poured wild as a torrent between the man and woman as they climbed . The Count looked almost in anger at the mountains ahead and at the pale cold sky , hating the reprimand , the accusation , the issue that kept the soft-haired , the young-mouthed , the slender woman and him apart . The words she did not say cried out in silence to him : Count Alain , Count Alain , look into our faces and let us save you , as if calling out to all youth in one man 's name as his likeness fled smaller and smaller from them on the desperate tide . Count Alain , Count Alain , turn and look at us , he knew she was crying after him , and the mountains rose vast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn and look in fear of what he might see summoning him there . " There are two men in the story , " Susan Farrow was saying as they walked up the country . " There is no woman in it , for it is a discord in which she plays no part . " " I want there to be a woman in it . I want you to be in it , " said the little boy , and the Count climbed sullenly ahead . " The men are not distinguishable by any race or nationality or color , " said Susan Farrow . " They may even have the same race and nationality or color , but they are different because one of them asks of the truth if it will give substance to the dream , and the other one asks if it will bring profit or fatality to him . The first man can be exiled from his country and his people if the survival of the dream demands it of him , and the other man will accept whatever comes , saying , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " and the Count , walking ahead , still loved the sound of her voice in his ears . " The first man is faithful , the second man is not ? " " Why ? Why do you say that ? " Count Alain cried out , swinging round . " Why do you speak of it as a matter of faith ? " " Because the dream does not alter , " said Susan Farrow . " Reality alters from century to century to suit the physical needs and the designs of continents and men . But the dream has never altered . " They came across the fields of the plateau , splitting the brittle roofs of the high , ice-held swamplands , their feet snapping the crusts of water and the short , faded , friable grass . When theyreached the door of the farmhouse the old lady who had watched them from the window coming through the pale , snowless light of afternoon led them into the stone-flagged hall . There they sat down at the heavy , thick-legged table under the beams and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food she had , and then he sat looking at Susan Farrow . " Let 's put our cards on the table , " he said at last . " I think there 's an exchange we can make . " He liked the game of adventurer he was playing , and he opened his cigarette case before her and smiled across the boards . " You talk vaguely of men getting ' across . ' I 'd like to know just how far your knowledge goes about it . " " What have you got to exchange for the answer to that ? " asked Susan Farrow , and she lighted her own cigarette and shook her hair back and threw the match away . " Perhaps your freedom of movement , yours and your son 's , " said the Count . " It 's possible that you might want to go back to America one day . " " Ah , if I knew how they got across ! " Susan Farrow cried out in a low , despairing voice , and she brought her fist down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be going on foot from town to town telling men how to do it ! 1 would n't be sitting idle here ! " The old lady put the great pitchers of milk down before them , and the slabs of butter , and the slices cut from the honeycomb itself running deeply and slowly with gold . The bread was freshly baked and good , and there was sugar . It was the kind of lavish , casual thing which the whole country , in just four months of quiet-faced disaster , had almost forgotten could be . " There 's a law against this now , " said the Count , but he went on eating . " The old lady 'd have trouble if ever an inspector stopped by . " " Inspectors do n't climb mountains , " said Susan Farrow , and she poured the rich milk into the glasses for them . " I believe our government 's changed HILAIRE AND THE all that , " Count Alain said as he buttered his bread . " There are new men in the new order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even at this height ? " said Susan Farrow . " To see we do the approved Vichy method ? " " Why not ? " said the Count , and suddenly Susan Farrow halted , and she sat there , silent a moment looking at him , with the milk pitcher still lifted in her hand . At the end of the first week the little boy came home from school one afternoon and said he was starting a newspaper . He crossed the hotel hall and went straight to the desk where his mother was writing letters , and he slung his schoolbooks in the leather bag down and said he was starting a newspaper with two other boys . Count Alain was playing billiards by the plate-glass window , and he clipped the white ball neatly and the red ball dropped into the center pocket . When he had done this he stood back , tall and elegant , with his legs spread , and he carefully chalked the end of his cue . " So you 're starting a newspaper , are you ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would you like me to write you something for it ? I could write you some poetry about my schooldays . I used to have a paper of my own in school . in statu quo ante bellum . " " No , " said the little boy , " that would n't do . " He drew his finger thoughtfully down the length of the table in the red wood 's groove , and he said : " We 're not going to publish poetry . It 's a newspaper about the war . " That was the beginning of it , and after that the little boy did n't hang round watching the billiards or watching the bridge games in the evening , or waiting to see if the barometer needle might be altering for snow . Instead , he would go up to his mother 's room and sit down at the table under the light to do his homework quickly so as to get on to the things he wanted to do . He would write his paragraphs out in ink , and he did n't ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain kind of pride were involved in it . He was doing it as a man might have done it , in high and lonely decision , and there must be no implication of women in the way . It may have been that he was writing it all down for one man to read , perhaps for one man in particular who had made no sign of life to them and who perhaps could make none . " Do the other two boys on the paper know how to spell a little ? " his mother would say , but out of respect she did n't look toward the table where he wrote the things out . " They 're older than me , " the little boy said . " One 's eleven already , but I 'm the editor of it . They 're collecting stories about politics and everything , and then we write them up . " " If it 's about politics perhaps you ought to be sure and spell the names of the real people and the real places right , " his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We do n't do that , " he said . " We do n't spell the naine.s of real people the way other papers do . " On the first of November the newspaper came out . The little boy came in from school with his books on his back and a proud shy look in his eye . He crossed the entrance hall to where his mother sat writing letters at the desk , writing letters to Syria in hope still , and letters to America saying there was still no news of one man out of a nation of them , and until there was she could n't come home . Count Alain was seated near her , beating himself at chess , when the little boy came in and laid the newspaper down . " So here it is at last , " said Susan Farrow . It was done on foolscap paper , and there was only one copy of it , the little boy said , and he stood there looking at it with his eyes bright and his face pointed delicately with pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stretched his long legs and arms out . " What 's your newspaper called ? " he asked , putting his voice into his yawn . " It 's called ' La Came a Peche , ' " said Susan Farrow , reading the words of the tide slowly out , and without a moment 's pause and as if the four separate words had been four separate slaps across his face , Count Alain sprang to his feet and crossed to the desk . " I did n't know you were going to write about fishing , " Susan Farrow was saying to the little boy , and the Count said : " Excuse me , please , " and took the newspaper out of her hand . He stood by the desk , near the light , the better to read the lines of small , painstaking print , and he did not speak as his cyc ran down the page . The paper was already not quite clean , and the edges of it were ragged , and on the front page  --  where the drawing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man with a small mustache on his lip and a lock of hair on his forehead , and what may have been the horns of a devil jutting on his brow . He was not very expertly  --  certainly not recognizably  --  done , but it was apparent that he was leading an old gentleman on a cane to the top of what could be accepted as a ski-jump by those who knew . But so that there might be no mistake , the names of the two of them were written across the belts , below the smeared gilt medals and decorations that hung upon their breasts . The name of the man with the hotel-inked mustache was " Hilaire " and the old man 's name was " le Mar6chal Ntard " ; and as the Count studied the drawing the little boy moved nearer to him in the light . " He 's taking him up there to try and make him jump , " he said in explanation , and there was his name scrawled beneath it with a boldness those other French cartoonists who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in might have looked at with envy and pride . " I see , " said the Count , and he read slowly down the column of uneven , childish print and turned the page to read the article headed " La Legion d'Honeur . " " The Legion of Horror consists of wearing a small red ribbon which can be bought by the yard , " the article said in part , and the Count 's hand fled instinctively to the red thread in the buttonhole of his lapel . " But it will save you a lot of trouble if you just write to Fishy for it . " " Oh , Fishy ! " said Susan Farrow , sharing the page with the Count as he read , and she began laughing . " That 's where the Twine a Peche ' comes in ? " " Not quite , " said the Count . " Look it up in the Larousse . You 'll find it under the word ' Gaul &; " That night the Count did not come to their table in the dining room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call out to the little boy across the tables ; he did not even look their way . Instead , he ordered a second carafe of wine , and he drank it fast and bitterly , and then he went out , slamming the hotel door behind him , and paced up and down the bleak wintry square . Susan Farrow could see him through the window walking up and down , his hands in his pockets , his steps long , wide ; and slow . Up and down he turned between the church 's shadow and the pharmacy 's shingled tower , back and forth through the circle of ice-white light the high dim street lamp cast , back and forth in the cold as if seeking to ease the torment in his heart . How late it was she did not know when the knock sounded on her door . She sat up quickly and switched the light on by the bed . She thrust her feet into her slippers , and pulled the pink quilted robe on as she crossed the room , thinking only that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing for which all life was in abeyance now . She called out : " I 'm coming , " and she heard her own voice shaking as she said it . She could see the pale strip of paper , the blue shape and size of the telegram forwarded on from one address after another , catching her up here late at night at last . But when she opened the door , there was only the Count standing there in the long , bare corridor of the hotel hall , leaning against the door jamb with his young , vain , rather drunken eyes looking gravely at her face . " I have something to say . Please let me say it to you , " he said , and she stood there shaking her head in bewilderment at him a moment , the pain of betrayal and bereavement numbing her before the sense of outrage came . She scarcely knew that she stepped back and let him pass into the room or that she closed the door behind him . It was only when she saw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table by the bed and stand , swaying a little , looking at his face that she felt the outrage . " So that 's his face , " he said . " So that 's his face . " " You ca n't possibly meet his eyes , " she said , and she took the photograph with a hard , quick movement from his hand . " Very well , " said the Count , standing there before her , " maybe that 's what I 've come to say . I have n't felt any shame or guilt before , so why should you make me feel it , why the devil should you ? What has he done that I have n't done that he 's held up like a saint before me ? I 've had enough of it , " he said , and he stood there in his breeches and military boots and his dark flannel shirt looking almost grievously at her . " I 'm still serving my country , I 'm here keeping order , doing what there is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he is out there . . . " " Serving your country ? " Susan Farrow began in anger , holding the photograph against her in her hands not as if it were likeness , but the actual text of the covenant which he had never read and in which he could have no part . But he had come in to have his say , and he slopped her short to say it . " Talk of reality ! " he almost shouted , with the blood coming into his face . " Let me tell you for once what the situation was when I got back to my mother 's house in Brittany . The Germans had walked into the town two weeks before , and what did they find when they got there but the mayor gone and the chief of police gone and the fire brigade gone , and no one in authority left to take charge ! When a fire broke out , it was the Germans who had to put it out ! A nation of officials on the run ! A nation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And running in pursuit of what ? In pursuit of the dream you will tell me ! " " There were others , " said Susan Farrow , holding fast to the covenant in her hands . " As a Frenchman , you should speak of those others . " " But those were Frenchmen , those were Frenchmen ! " the Count cried out . " And now we 're learning the lesson we had to learn . We who had forgotten national unity are learning the terms of the new order from people who have known for centuries what a national spirit means . " He fumbled a cigarette out of his case , and then , in belated gallantry , he held the case blindly toward her , but she shook her head . " Frenchmen ! " he said again . " Frenchmen ! A whole nation of us flinging off our uniforms as we ran ! " " Not a nation , " said Susan Farrow quietly . " There were others . There are other stories to tell . " She watched him holding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she went on saying : " Remember that long beach . Remember the enemy had been bombarding that beach and the wharves beyond it for three nights and days . There were sixty thousand men on that beach , " she said . " Men without food and with scarcely any arms , but they would not surrender . But when the enemy came over the dunes on the fourth morning at dawn they no longer met any resistance . There were only a few survivors left , a few famished men among the thousands of dead . " The Count had let the match go out and he stood with the dead stick of it in his fingers , looking at her . " That was last June , " she said . " The place was Dunkerque . The sixty thousand men were French . " " So you are to be my conscience , " the Count said slowly . " You , without a drop of French blood in your veins . " " There were others , " she said , speaking almost in pain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , the Cadets of Saumur , who for something as foolish as honor kept two German divisions from crossing the Loire , " and suddenly the Count sat down on the edge of the bed , and he pulled her down , in her soft pink robe , beside him . He sat there with his arm in the elegant , dark wool , sport-shirt sleeve laid gently round her , looking down at the toes of her bedroom slippers before he began to speak . " So you are to be my conscience , " he said again . " You are not to be my love , but my conscience ? ' He did not move , but he sat there a little drunk , with his arm around her , on the edge of the bed . " Unless you could come to believe I was someone else , " he said . " Unless you could close your eyes and believe I was some other man , or some other kind of man , a man trying to get from Syria to England . . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bistro and tell the peasants one thing , " Susan Farrow said , holding the photograph close , " I 'll sit down at another table and tell them other stories . " " Will you tell them how a man gets from Syria to England ? " the Count said . " I would tell them , " said Susan Farrow quietly , " I would tell them all if I knew how it was done . " Whether it was for love or for information that he came that night to the room she never had enough curiosity about him to decide . She only knew that when he started speaking of her beauty and her gentleness , and when he sought to take the picture from her , she had got up and walked across the room to the window , and pulled the curtain back and stood there looking out at the church 's and the tower 's shadows in the streetlight 's pallor on the square . " Now you had better go , " she said , with her back turned to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said again , without turning : " Count Alain , I 'd like you to go , " and almost at once she heard the door close behind him . It was not until next morning , when she looked for it , that she found the little boy 's newspaper was no longer there . The village gendarmes called it " the Hilaire and the Marechal Petard affair " and it never quite ceased to be funny to them . But the secret police , who had been sent from somewhere else to make the investigation , did n't take it that way at all . It was the secret police , in plain clothes , who walked into the schoolroom and gave the names of the three boys to the schoolteacher that cold November afternoon . They took the boys , and later they - took each parent , separately into the room of the chef de brigade , and they questioned them for three or four hours at a stretch . The first one to be put through the rigamarole was Susan Farrow 's little boy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking him , and the little boy standing there before the two men in his navy jersey and his ski-trousers said he had been born in Paris . " Where is your father ? " said the first man again . It was he who kept his hat on during the entire inquiry , and the other man sitting at the corner of the desk kept his overcoat round his shoulders because of the mountain cold . " He 's in the army in Syria , " the little boy said , and then he caught sight of one document in particular lying on the desk . " Look , that 's my newspaper , " he said quickly . " I 'm the editor of it . " " Your mother told you about your father , did n't she ? " said the first man as if the little boy had not said anything at all , and he watched his face carefully as he spoke . " She told me he was in Syria , " the little boy said . " We did n't have any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the document lying on the desk , and he said : " I only made one copy of my newspaper and I lost it . I 've been looking for it everywhere . " " Your mother told you your father was trying to get out of Syria , did n't she ? " the second man said . He sat quite still , but alert , at the desk , as if fearing the slightest move might put the sound of the truth to flight . " Whenever she talked about your father she told you she hoped he might be getting to another country , did n't she ? " he asked . " No , " said the little boy , and he did not take his eyes off his newspaper lying on the desk . " She did n't . She never said anything about anything like that . " " Now , " said the first man , and he picked up the newspaper from the desk , " I 'm going to read something aloud to you . " He sat there with the painstakingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You are here to face certain charges , charges of a seditious nature , " he said , " and we want to find out where the blame lies . So when I 'm finished reading I want you to tell me who wrote what I will have read . " He cleared his throat and he pushed his hat back off his forehead and he started reading . When he was done with the article he put the paper down and looked at the little boy . " Do you recognize those words ? " he said . " Yes , " said the little boy . " I wrote them . And I did the picture on the other side . " He put out his hand in eagerness as if to turn the first page back again , but the man with the hat on did it for him . " That 's my name . That 's it signed under the drawing , " he said . On the second day of the inquiry Susan Farrow waited in the outer room where the gendarmes sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window she saw in surprise that the snow had begun to fall . It was a wonderful thing to see it coming down now after all the weeks of waiting for it , the clear little flakes coming delicately like early stars across the window 's glass . She watched it falling , and she thought perhaps only mountain people , mountain and skiing people , knew this suspense that attended the coming of the snow . In mountain places there was one kind of impatience for the snow that fell too early and another annoyance for the snow that fell too late in the spring when the time had come for the plowing . But now , as if by some miracle , the snow had come in its right and proper time , and the peasants ' shoes would be hushed beneath them on the roads , and they would all feel the softening of the world , the easing of the tension . The brittle soil would go and the blank rock , and the earth would turn deeply and soundlessly to peace . She was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer room , and she knew their faces : the old lady from the honey-farm up on the hill , and the bistro-keeper who leaned on the bar and listened to what the peasants and the Count would have to say . " Bon jour , Madame , " said the bistro-keeper to her , and he came and shook her hand , and the little old lady sat down beside her and bowed her head , and the tears fell down her face . The bistro-keeper took his cap from his head , and he shook the sprinkling of snow from it . Then he looked boldly about the room eying one gendarme after the other . " We 've been sold , sold , Madame , " he said , speaking the words bitterly and loud . " We 've been sold for a price they pay across the counter ! Do you know why we 're here ? " He flung out his hand towards the old lady , and he said : " She , reported for serving food in her kitchen to mountain-climbers who came past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An inspector comes in , orders what he wants , eats it , and then walks down the hill and sends his report in Who he is , she does n't know . And 1 , why am I here ? For listening to the English broadcasts ! France , " he cried out , " inspected , reported , denounced ! France , do you understand me ! " he shouted , swinging about where he stood so as to face them all . " France , inspected , reported , betrayed , and not by foreigners , but by Frenchmen , by Frenchmen we ca n't put our finger on ? " " The flits are inside , " said a gendarme from the corner . " You 'd better keep quiet and sit down . " " I 'd like to know who the informer is ! " the bistro-keeper shouted . " I 'd like to get my hands around his neck . . . . " In an hour the little boy came out from the inner room where the secret policemen put their questions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sight of the falling snow if the gendarme with him had not put his hand upon his arm . " Look , mother , the snow , the snow ! " he cried , and she felt in herself the same inexplicable elation . " Yes , yes , the snow , " she said as they led her through the door . The secret policemen were sitting as they had sat for two days now at the desk , one with his hat on and the other in his overcoat , and the gendarme closed the door behind her . They had not before , and they did not now ask her to sit down , and she hooked her thumbs through her army belt and waited . " You received a telegram to-day , " the first man said , and Susan Farrow said : " No , I did not . " " Yes , " said the second man , but his hand did not move toward it . " We have it here . " Susan Farrow took one step nearer the desk , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of it for the strength to hear and know . She saw the color go from her nails with the pressure on the wood , and as she waited the tide of blood ebbed coldly and slowly from her heart . " It was sent from London last night , " the first man said , and he held the narrow , blue , inked paper in his hand . " It says this . It says : ' Address me Amexco all well , ' " he said , and he looked up at her . " The signature is in , code , " he said . " It 's signed ' Pimpernel . ' Now you are to tell us exactly what it means . " Susan Farrow waited a moment , holding to the desk , before she began repeat-ing the name aloud , but the look had already altered in her eyes . " Pimpernel , " she said , " Pimpernel , " and it might have been music playing strong and sweet in the room , and she seekingto give them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Revolution ! " she said . " The French Revolution ! Pimpernel was a character from a book  --  the substance of the dream ? " " You are to tell us , " said the man with the overcoat on his shoulders , " who this telegram is from . " " But Pimpernel ! " Susan Farrow cried . " Pimpernel ! He saved French patriots from the guillotine ! He got them to England or somewhere  --  anyway , out of the country ! Pimpernel ! " she said with love . In a moment she might start laughing aloud . It was not through choice that she saw Count Alain again , but when she and the little boy got back to the hotel he was playing billiards alone beneath the light . He stood back from the table when he saw them come in and brush the snow from their coats , and he chalked his cue with blue . " We 'll all be skiing to-morrow ! " he called across the room , and Susan Farrow did not turn her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start toward the stairway ; but when she put her foot on the first step of the stairs she saw him standing there . " Both of you , " he was saying , hardly aloud , " get the night train to Lyon , " and he was smiling still . He might have been asking her which run they 'd take down together tomorrow while the snow was new , but his lips were saying : " Fix up your papers with the consul and get off quickly . " " Is this the voice of conscience ? " said Susan Farrow bitterly , but Count Alain did not answer . He had strolled back to the billiard table and was studying the look of it there .
