The Adventures of Tartu ( M.G.M.-Gainsborough ) enlists Robert Donat , Valerie Hobson and a cast like a jeweler 's tray in the shiniest spy thriller since Night Train ( TIME , Jan. 13 , 1941 ) . Many expert British melodramas baffle U.S. audiences because they are too exotically British . This one , directed in Britain by M.G.M. 's Harold S. Bucquet , is as intelligible to Americans as to Englishmen . <P> Robert Donat plays a British chemist who undertakes a secret , suicidally difficult mission to Rumania . His orders : to get a job in a Nazi plant which is manufacturing the most destructive poison gas in history . He must also learn the formula and destroy the plant in time to avert the use of the gas against Britain . <P> Agent Donat arrives by parachute , spends a few minutes disguised as a Rumanian peasant , then transforms himself into Tartu , a Rumanian Iron Guardist , reeking with pomade , corny gallantries and devotion to the New Order . <P> In a remarkably short time Tartu : 1 ) locates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job at the gas works , 3 ) does a broken-field run through the intricate perils which arise from the fact that he is suspected by friend &; foe alike , 4 ) completes his explosive assignment in the hotfooted course of one of those thrilling , dreamlike chases in which pursuers stick out their chins for the hero , great iron doors delay their closing just long enough for him to skin through , and a car and plane synchronize a getaway as happy , and unlikely , as a chain letter that really pays off . <P> In these exciting shenanigans Donat is supported by Valerie Hobson as the politically ambiguous darling of several Nazi big shots , by an incisively cast crowd of Nazis , saboteurs and undergrounders , and by pacing as shrewdly varied as that of a roller coaster . Miss Hobson , besides being a sensible actress , is one cinemactress who can really be described as beautiful . As the gigolesque Iron Guardist , rococo Robert Donat turns in one of the best performances of his career . All Tartu needs , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ razor-edged melodramatic and psychological inventiveness which belongs to Alfred Hitchcock in strict monopoly and has been conferred on a very few of his compatriots , in very small doses . <P> A Lady Takes A Chance ( RKO-Radio ) takes quite a few . It takes a chance with one more treatment of a well-worn story-pattern ( the Cowboy &; the Lady ) , and emerges from the scrimmage with a broad grin to offset its black eye . It takes a chance with making the cowboy ( John Wayne ) rather more than a nice boy , the lady ( Jean Arthur ) rather less than a lady , and both of them rather more primordially interested in each other than the Hays Office likes to feel that people should be . Director William Seiter seems to have fallen just short of a new sort of realistic , deeply indigenous comedy . His picture is often crude , sometimes raw , but definitely worth seeing . <P> Miss Jean Arthur is a personable young New Yorker on a gruesomely predigested bus tour of the prewar West . The tour begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Wayne falls on , and all but busts , her . The pair recuperate in a deafening Western barroom , involve themselves in a saloon free-for-all , settle down to their essential business on a hay wagon and , after Miss Arthur misses her bus , in a sinister small-town hotel .
