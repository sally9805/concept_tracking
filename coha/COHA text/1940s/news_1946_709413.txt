txt FACT FINDING ASKED Hodgson for Five-Nation Study of Situation and Outlook on Spain GROMYKO BACKS POLAND Says Franco Is Fascist Threat to Peace  --  Cadogan , Differing , Aims Some Darts at Russia Excerpts from transcript of Security Council session , P. 12 . By W. H. LAWRENCE Australia proposed yesterday that the United Nations Security Council set up a special five-member committee to report by May 17 as to whether continuance of the Franco regime in Spain was a purely internal problem of the Spanish people , whether it was likely to lead to international friction , and whether it was likely to endanger the maintenance of peace and security . Put forth as a compromise proposal after a majority of the Council had indicated unwillingness to support , on the basis of the present evidence , Poland 's proposal that all members of the United Nations be directed to sever diplomatic relations with Spain , the Australian plan would direct a special United Nations investigatory body to obtain " written statements and documentary evidence " from the Franco regime as well as from any member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be voted upon until next week , but it appeared last night to have an excellent chance of adoption , perhaps with some minor clarifying amendments . The Security Council will meet again at 3 P. M. Tuesday . Experts Disagree on Iran Issue The members have agreed to lay aside the Spanish issue at that time and resume debate upon the Soviet Union 's demand that Iran 's complaint against her be dropped from the agenda immediately without waiting for reports on May 6 as to whether the Red Army has completed its evacuation of Iran . Yesterday the Council 's Committee of Experts voted eight to three that it was legal to keep the case on the agenda , even though both Iran and the Soviet Union have asked withdrawal . This report will be the basis of the Tuesday debate and the members of the Council will decide the issue at that time . In the three hour and four-minute formal session of the Security Council yesterday , only Andrei A. Gromyko , Soviet delegate , spoke in favor of the Polish resolution branding the Franco regime as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and calling for the severance of diplomatic relations . Four Voice Opposition His view was opposed by Sir Alexander Cadogan of the United Kingdom , Dr. Pedro Laeo Velloso of Brazil , Dr. Quo Tai-chi of China and Lieut . Col. W. R. Hodgson of Australia . All made the point that Poland had not substantiated her charges and established that Franco was a threat to world peace . Dr. Hafez Afifi Pasha of Egypt , President of the Council , has not spoken as yet , but on the basis of the present record , the Polish motion is assured of only four votes . while seven are required for adoption , including all five votes of the permanent members of the Council . The four members in favor of the motion are Poland , the Soviet Union , France and Mexico . Representing the only country against which Spanish troops took an active role in World War II , Mr. Gromyko made an eloquent plea for collective action to force the removal of Generalissimo Francisco Franco and warned the other nations that they were liable to repeat the pre-war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first instance the rise of Hitler , AlussoLini and Franco a. 1 brought on the bloody struggle just completed victoriously by the United Nations . " The policy of non-intervention practiced by the League of Na // tions , and by some of the states represented in this organization , encouraged German fascism and was one of the causes of the war which Fascist aggression inflicted , on the peace-loving peoples of the ' world , " Mr. Gromyko declared . " This shameful policy of non-1 intervention was applied to Franco at the time of the civil war in ' Spain , as Franco , with the help of Hitler and Mussolini , proceeded to crush the Spanish republic . The price of that policy is well known to all of us , the price of that policy ; was a heap of corpses and a river of blood . " The Soviet Ambassador said that it was clear that the Franco regime was more than an internal affair of the Spanish people , and that the United Nations had not only the right but a duty to intervene . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the organization should be " an active instrument for the maintenance of international peace and security , " but , he added , it can fulfill that role " only if it fights against fascism in whatever form fascism may exist , and only if it fights against the instigators of war , irrespective of the misleading phrases that such instigators of war may use . " I would submit , Mr. President , that humanity will not accept a refusal by the Security , Council to take action against this Fascist hydra , which slain in one quarter will appear elsewhere , " the Soviet representative continued . " I would express the earnest hope that the Council will take the proper steps to deal with the situation in Spain , laden as it is with danger for the international community . " Sir Alexander Cadogan 's prepared address was a less emotional approach to the Spanish problem . He declared that the evidence offered by Poland , and in the supporting speeches of France and Mexico on Wednesday , did not provide adequate proof that Spain had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or participated in an aggressive act . He added that he believed it would be unwise to sever diplomatic relations with Spain because it was the influence of Allied missions in Spain at the present time that had played a major role in uprooting German influence in that country . He pointed out that his Government had ne more love for Franco than the other members of the Security Council , but , he insisted , it would not be wise to move against Franco collectively on.the basis of the present evidence . . Two Barbs for Russia Tucked away in Sir Alexander 's address were two finely pointed barbs aimed at the Soviet Union , who , Council members feel , was the motivating factor behind the presentation of Poland 's complaint to the Council after the British and Americans had persuaded the French not to raise the Spanish issue at this time . He noted that Dr. Oscar Lange of Poland on Wednesday had made " an eloquent appeal to the Council in the name of Poland , liberated by all the United Nations , " and he observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my country , which had the honor of being the first to declare war on Hitler in support of Poland " and which had , in fact , " fought through every day of two World Wars . " He said also that much of the evidence against Franco concerned the Spanish dictator 's actions in the early years of the war when , " undoubtedly , Franco was then convinced that German power was irresistible and that Hitler would conquer Europe , and he wished to draw from that the best advantage he could for his country . " The British diplomat looked up from his prepared remarks and in the direction of Mr. Gromyko as he added that Franco " was not alone in making that mistake . " The references obviously were to the fact that Germany and the Soviet Union had a non-aggression pact at the beginning of the war and invaded Poland together in August , 1939 , and did not break off friendly relations until the Nazis marched into Russia on June 22 , 1941 . Colonel Hodgson , offering his compromise , complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Spain and on the various allegations made in the Polish complaint . " We have here at this table two schools of thought , " he continued . " One school says , let us , without investigation , in.i.ose certain sanctions . The other school says , We wo n't do anything because it is a matter of domestic jurisdiction . The viewpoint of the Australian delegation is that we accept neither proposition . " We want an investigation into the three questions I have indicated . First , is it a matter of international concern and not merely of domestic jurisdiction ? Secondly , is the situation a cause of international friction ? If the answer to that question is yes , the third question arises , Is it endangering international peace and security ? If the answer is yes , then and then only can this Council decide what can and should be done . " The Australian proposal differs fundamentally , however , from the atomic energy investigation that the Spanish Government proposed last week when the Polish complaint first was put forward . The Franco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations with which it maintains friendly relations  --  thus excluding Russia , Poland , China , Mexico and Australia  --  and would have limited the inquiry to the allegation that German scientists in Spain are working on new methods of warfare . That plan never had a chance of adoption by the Security Council . When Colonel Hodgson completed his speech , it was learned at once that the representatives of treat Britain and the United States , which have led the opposition to the Polish resolution , were favorably impressed with the compromise proposal , but , before committing themselves , wished to transmit it to their Governments for study and instructions over the week-end . This will be done . Dr. Francisco Castillo Najera of Mexico , who seconded the Polish motion on Wednesday , told this writer that he favored the investigation proposed by Australia in the belief that the facts brought out by such an inquiry " may induce the Security Council to recommend some more forcible action than a mere breach of relations with the Franco regime .
