txt Saving Grease Is Important I do n't believe people generally are aware of the urgency of saving waste fats and greases . But it is incumbent upon every man , woman and child who cooks as much as a fried egg to see that the grease is saved for the glycerine properties it contains . From this glycerine come dynamite and ballistite to fire shells . Formerly we obtained glycerine from vegetable oils imported from the Far East and the Philippines . Now we are depending upon women in their kitchens to do this job . A woman who throws away grease is throwing the dice to the enemy . On the other hand , the housewife who proudly carries her own can of cold grease to a meat market is setting a patriotic example . She should be proud to be seen carrying it for all her neighbors and friends to see . HELEN M. KEARSING . New York , July 30 , 1942.
