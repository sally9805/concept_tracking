txt Lured by promises of immediate employment at substantial wages , hundreds of former service men and civilian students who put in long hours of study at privately operated drafting schools in the city have found their training virtually " worthless " and have been unable to qualify for jobs in architects ' offices , it became known yesterday . A survey by executives of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects showed that graduates of many schools were unable to draw or read simple plans , or in some cases even to execute proper lettering ; that their courses of instruction were out-of-date and their textbooks at least two decades behind the times . Leading members of the profession expressed the opinion that heavy expenditures by the Veterans Administration in this field under the GI Bill of Rights had been " wasted " and that some of the schools had taken on the aspect of " diploma mills . " Only about " half a dozen " of these graduates have found jobs in New York drafting rooms , and scores of others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their exhibits of fitness for the work , have turned to other types of business . Their *500 tuition fees , generally paid by the Government , and their 1,000 hours of so-called technical studies thus have gone for naught . The " shameful " situation was emphasized in a report of the committee on education of the architectural group , submitted yesterday by its chairman , Ben John Small , and summarized in the annual report of Harold Sleeper , president , at the annual luncheon meeting of the chapter in the Architectural League . Tho report deplored the lack of // training of these graduates , scored the apparent superficiality of supervision by the New York State ! Department of Education , and criticized also the Veterans Administration for its inadequate handling ot the problem . Many of the men never should have tried out for architecture , and proper screening or vocational guidance by the VA or other authorities would have eliminated a large number from the classes , the committee reported . Most of the diploma holders were discovered to have ? ittle practical training or experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances the men were led to believe that their earnings would be considerably greater than they actually obtained in the rela-1 tively few cases where they found employment . Some of the schools held out the " bait " of quick jobs at $40 to $70 a week , when apprentice pay in the drafting rooms usually has run about $25 to $30 a week , Mr. Small explained . ' Some members of the Institute , responding to a questionnaire , said the graduates would have been better off without the course , starting in an architect 's office as office boys . Mr. Small explained that the situation had been brought to the attention of officials of ' the State Department of Education , which has supervision over the schools , several months ago . The officials appeared to be conscious of the problem , but cited lack of adequate technical supervisors . The architects offered their cooperation as advisers or voluntary aides , but reported " no action yet ' : on their ' protests . Mr. Small pointed out that to be eligible for an examination for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an accredited high school diploma ( sixteen Regents ' units ) and twelve years in an architect 's office , or a five-year degree at an accredited school and three years in an architect 's office . " These drafting schools just do not fit in with these standards and requirements , " he commented . He emphasized that the complaints had no reference to the established , accredited schools and colleges which have sound architectural courses and experienced instructors . At the luncheon session , Harold S. Buttenheirn , editor of The American City , was inducted as an honorary associate of the chapter in recognition of his long service in behalf of housing and planning . The chapter 's apartment-design medals for 1948 were awarded to Emery Roth and Louis E. Ordwein . Mr. Sleeper was re-elected president of the group , along with the following officers : Daniel Schwartzman , vice president ; Francis W. Roudebush , secretary , and William Potter , treasurer . Aaron N. Kiff and Geoffrey Platt were named to the executive committee .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
