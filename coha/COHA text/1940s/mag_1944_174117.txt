Snug in her cozy Suffolk home , small , bright-eyed , merry Lady ( Dorothea ) Gibb read an article by famed Soviet Journalist Ilya Ehrenburg exhorting his fellow Russians to hate the Nazis harder than ever . To so devout a Quaker as 83-year-old Lady Gibb , such talk was abhorrent . She penned a note to Comrade Ehrenburg , told him he was filling Russian minds " with something very old and evil , a thirst for vengeance after victory . . . . This does not bring happiness to the victor but only leads to sorrow and evil in the future . " <P> Back from Author Ehrenburg came an adamant reply : " Respected Lady Gibb , you are just mistaken in charging me with particular vindictiveness . As a son of my people ... I am voicing our common sentiment . You say , strange lady , that evil can not triumph . That is true because ranged against evil are human beings . . . . <P> " We read with pain the reports of the flying bomb on London . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , or the Germans who man the flying bomb installations ? You can not forgive both the wolf and the lamb . That amounts to giving the wolf first a good dinner and then a soothing sermon to aid his digestion . <P> " You say the Almighty does not need the help of men to cope with the forces of evil . From childhood on I have respected all creeds but every religion teaches that man must help good to triumph . . . . " <P> Last week Lady Gibb learned that Ehrenburg 's letter to her had been printed in the Red Star , had started a furious correspondence from Red Army men &; women . Sapper Pikalov was moved to strike off a poem titled War on Lady Gibb . <P> Signed Lady Gibb last week : " Oh dear , what have I done now ? ... I did n't expect my letter to be turned into a newspaper controversy . I wrote as a good Quaker . It wo n't do any good-all this hate . The ordinary people of Germany are having their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their families are broken . I would not kill Hitler ... I should like to see him paint houses again and wallpaper a few homes .
