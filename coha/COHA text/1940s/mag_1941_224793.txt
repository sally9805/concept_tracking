Children live in a world peopled by large , self-confident beings who seem to do what they please but will not let children do what they please . If children brood on this situation too much , or if the situation gets them down , they can develop obsessions , phobias , complexes , neuroses as black-fledged as any grownup 's . In general , the symptoms are abnormal behavior-tantrums , lethargy , refusal to eat , overeating , wetting their beds " when they are old enough to know better . " <P> In Manhattan last week nearly 1,000 members and guests of the American Orthopsychiatric Association gathered to discuss the grim problems of childhood . " Orthopsychiatry , " the scientific study of abnormal behavior , concentrates largely on children . Since it is impossible to explain such polysyllabic notions as therapy or its need to moppets , and since they themselves have difficulty communicating with grownups , the orthopsychiatrist must be wily , has to resort to ruses and symbols , not only to communicate with children but to gain their confidence . <P> Play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his unsuspecting little patients , and at the same time get the dope on them , is to play with them . Dr. Joseph C. Solomon of Baltimore is a great hand with small dolls , toy furniture , vehicles , etc. , which he uses to set up family situations . If the patient is a little girl , the therapist provides her with a doll with which she unconsciously identifies herself . She makes the doll perform actions which she would not admit any notion of doing herself . One little girl made a toy streetcar run over the sister and mother images - to the doctor , a dead giveaway . Drs . Frank Ford Tallman and Leon Nathaniel Goldensohn find a " Betsy Wetsy " doll ( one which can be given water , and wets its diapers ) useful because it " allows the child to discuss all sorts of intimate situations that have interested and worried him . " <P> Comic Strips .

" Dr. Bender told of a little girl whose father was a bootlegger , gambler and eventual suicide , whose mother was a paranoid cancer sufferer . Obsessed by the need of escape , the girl identified herself with one of the Hawk Man 's constantly rescued women . A boy who had been ignored all his life by an unstable mother and an alcoholic father believed that he was in constant danger , that he would die in five years . He found relief by identifying himself with the invulnerable Superman . For normal children : " Desire for blood and thunder is not depraved , and satisfying it by reading the comic books is a relatively innocuous and socially acceptable form of its release . It would seem to offer the same type of mental catharsis to its readers that Aristotle claimed was an attribute of the drama . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
