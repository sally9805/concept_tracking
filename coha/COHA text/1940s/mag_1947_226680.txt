When Frederick Gruin arrived in Nanking last fall to become TIME 'S first resident postwar correspondent there , he had to assume his share of the disorganization that eight years of Japanese occupation had inflicted upon China 's capital . His efforts to establish himself , his wife , and their young son ( partly detailed in his letter below ) are typical of the difficulties in covering the news over much of the Far East today : <P> " Only the wealthy , the lucky , or foreign officialdom have a chance to find a place to sleep in Nanking . By a stroke of luck and persistence in following up a Shanghai newspaper ad , we discovered the little house which is our domicile and TIME-LIFE 'S Nanking office . I can not even begin to convey the amount of personal effort and frustration we put into the housing quest . As an old China hand puts it : " If you hear of a house in Nanking , you do n't ask to see it ; you take it on the spot sight unseen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " The address of our office-residence is #3 Shih Tze-kai ( Crossroad ) . It is a six-room greybrick bungalow , with an attic , garage and shanty-like servants ' quarters . It has bamboo-fenced grounds , which were given over to neighborhood pigs , fowl and scabby babies . It had been occupied by the Japanese for eight years , and neglected for eight years . Consequently , it was in an absolutely revolting state of disrepair : no furniture , tat ami ( raised floors ) everywhere , brokendown plumbing and lighting , filth , filth and more filth . <P> " But it had once been a home . By the application of imagination , exhausting effort and money , we got together a native repair crew who did a job of painting and renovation which still is far from U.S. standards . By haunting the Government , we seem likely to get a phone ( in Shanghai , we hear , a civilian must spend $3,000 U.S. to have one installed where one has n't been before ) . By doggedness , we dug up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment would have cost $2,000 ) . By ruthless shopping we found several midget stoves ( coal has jumped from $60 to $110 U.S. a ton ; and at that it 's partly dust and clay ) , which will be our sole source of heat this winter . The Japs made scrap of most of China 's radiators and Nanking electric power is so rationed that electric heaters we brought with us from the States are useless . I might add , incidentally , that there is no cooking gas here ; all food is prepared over wood or coal-dust-cake fires . Our lease is for one year . The rent is $500 a month . <P> " Number 3 Shih Tze-kai will be an office as well as a home in one of the world 's important capitals . TIME-LIFE could never cover Chinese politics adequately from Shanghai . Nor is commuting between Shanghai and Nanking practical . Regular riding in casual Chinese planes sooner or later would be fatal ; the best train takes seven to eight hours one way ; the auto highway is still impassable because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
