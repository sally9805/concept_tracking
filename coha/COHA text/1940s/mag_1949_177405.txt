The question , as Humpty Dumpty told Alice , was simply who was to be master . When it arose , last week , in three big U.S. corporations , each handled it in a different way . <P> Gimlet-eyed old Chairman Sewell Avery had no trouble at all in glowering down all opposition to his one-man rule of Montgomery Ward &; Co. , Inc . After a couple of critics had halfheartedly denounced him at the annual meeting of stockholders in Chicago , Avery easily won re-election as a director and chairman . <P> Inland Steel Co. ' s President Wilfred Sykes had guided Inland to the biggest sales ( $395 million in 1948 ) and biggest profits ( $38.6 million ) in its history , had made it the seventh biggest U.S. producer . But Sykes had also established a rule for automatic retirement at age 65 . This week , 65-year-old Wilfred Sykes stepped upstairs to become chairman of the executive committee . He turned over the presidency to his assistant , Clarence Belden Randall , 58 . A Harvard-trained lawyer who this week also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named a vice president in 1930 , had been Sykes 's right-hand man since last October . <P> When the sales of Willys-Overland Motors , Inc. began to slip recently , Chairman-President James D. Mooney and Adman Ward M. Canaday , a top Willys stockholder , could not agree on what to do about it . Last week Mooney moved out as president , but stayed on as chairman . Canaday began shopping for another president . A likely candidate : ex-President Charles E. Sorensen , whom Canaday had kicked upstairs to vice chairman when Mooney came in three years ago . Thanks to an airtight contract from Canaday , Sorensen draws $1,000 a week for the next five years whether he does anything or not .
