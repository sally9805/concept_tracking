" The fulfillment of a dream ! " crowed NBC 's General David Sarnoff : " What a joy it is that this can be done while our beloved maestro is still a young man . " And with that , Arturo Toscanini , who will be 81 this week , raised his baton , and led the NBC Symphony into its first televised concert . <P> Last week , after Music Czar Petrillo lifted his ban on television ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) , the networks scrambled to be first to televise their big symphonies . CBS won by a nose , with a telecast of the Philadelphia Orchestra . It was an interesting performance : Maestro Eugene Ormandy , unwarily popping a peppermint into his mouth in midpassage ; the camera ogling the girl members of the orchestra . But for most televiewers it was just a curtain raiser for Toscanini , half an hour later . <P> Up &; down the East Coast , televiewers , many of them seeing their first symphony concert , were stirred by the dynamic old man . And Toscanini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form . No less adroit was the photography of Director Hal Keith 's three cameras . The television eye followed the music smoothly as it proceeded from section to section of the orchestra . It caught some remarkably candid glimpses of the maestro that concertgoers never see : Toscanini 's glittering eyes , flashing eloquent messages to his musicians ; his triumphant roar in the midst of a Wagnerian crescendo ; the beads of sweat , glistening on his brow. * <P> Afterwards , the praise was mountainous . " I ... enjoyed it very much , " wired President Truman . " Very good , very good " muttered Petrillo ( who had been invited by NBC to play his trumpet with the orchestra , but had cannily declined ) . <P> <P> *Technicians noted one minor flaw : in the closeups , Toscanini 's starched white cuffs made long shadows on the screen .
