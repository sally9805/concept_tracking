As the campaign train rolled into Seattle , the pickets who had dogged Senator Robert Taft 's trail up the coast massed to meet him . Outside the King Street Station , some 300 of them swung into action with boos , jeers and taunting placards ( " Taft 's G.O.P. is not for me " ) . Led by Washington 's Communist-line ex-Representative Hugh De Lacy , they surged around the Taft automobile . <P> Someone started pitching vegetables at the car . Alarmed , one of the Taft party slammed the car-door , catching the flesh of Taft 's palm in a steel vise . Then one picket broke forward , thrust his head into Taft 's face and cried : " You goddamned son of a bitch . " Taft wrenched his hand free , grimacing with pain , and the car drove off to his suite in the Olympic Hotel , where six stitches were taken in his palm . <P> It was obvious that the pickets were still doing Bob Taft more good than harm . That night , a well-disciplined band of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally stomped noisily out of the hall one by one . Washington Republicans , whose party loyalty had been much stronger than their personal enthusiasm for Taft , now rallied warmly to his defense . Labor leaders urged their members to stop the demonstrations . Quite aside from any effect on Taft himself , the picketing was too obviously an attempt to stop free discussion of public problems . <P> Terrible Blunder . No such side issues distracted Bob Taft from speaking his mind on those problems . So far he had stoutly defended the actions of the Republican 80th Congress , had sharply attacked the domestic policies of President Harry Truman . Two nights later , in Tacoma , he made his first major speech on U.S. foreign policy . <P> Like his other speeches , it was clear , reasoned and packed with facts . He began by pointing out that foreign policy is by law largely controlled by the President . Then he launched into his main indictment : " The results of the foreign policy of the Administration during the past three years have created a situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war and have brought the world to a state of economic collapse . " <P> Beginning with Teheran , charged Taft , the U.S. adopted a policy of " complete surrender " to Stalin and sold the principles of the Atlantic Charter down the river . Franklin Roosevelt 's notion that appeasing Stalin would transform him into " an angel of light " had been a terrible blunder . Though U.S. policy toward Russia had later stiffened-largely on Arthur Vandenberg 's urging- " we have won the war , but we have lost the peace . " <P> Taft pointed to other Democratic mistakes . The old Morgenthau plan to reduce Germany to a pastoral state was one . Piecemeal foreign aid was another . The " Mr. Fixit philosophy " of meddling in other countries ' affairs was a third . What did this " policy " add up to ? Chaos , said Taft . He concluded : " Our general attitude has been one of policy and expediency instead of law and fair dealing . ... I maintain , therefore , that ... we could not have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
