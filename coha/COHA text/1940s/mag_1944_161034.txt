Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art celebrated its 15th birthday last week . The celebration took the form of a massive show which was to earlier Modern Museum shows as lightning to static electricity . Only at the risk of shin splints did gallerygoers poke into all the corners of the Museum 's spectacular open house . Outstanding were : <P> A second floor crammed with modern paintings , owned and loaned . Prize of the exhibit ( which included practically every modern artist of note from Degas to Miro ) : Pablo Picasso 's Woman Seated before a Mirror . <P> The retrospection and prophecy of the top floor , crammed with pretzel-shaped , chair-sized chips of plywood ( to demonstrate the versatility of wood molders ) ; pat-the-bunny samples of various materials ; early modern chairs whose box-kitelike form suggested early abstract paintings-and a chair whose fishnet seat ( draped over a pneumatic , plastic doughnut ) was surrealistically adapted to the most unsurrealistic sitter . <P> A photogenetic first floor , which reviewed the camera 's art from the days of Civil War Photographer Mathew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edwards in Front of Indian Rock , Lookout Mt. ) to Ansel Adams ' magical Moonrise , New Mexico , Edward Weston 's claims to be the Ingres of modern photography , and Walker Evans ' deceptively simple-seeming studies of Main Street . <P> Innocence and Bliss . The show and the crowds would have pleased the Modern Museum 's prime founder , Lizzie ( " Lillie " ) P. Bliss , late , wealthy daughter of Drygoodsman Cornelius N. Bliss . Genial hostess of a teetotaling salon , Founder Bliss was one of the greatest art collectors produced by Manhattan society 's latter-day Age of Innocence . <P> She began to gather moderns seriously when they made their first U.S. reconnaissance in force at the 1913 Armory Show . In 1919 , with Mrs. John D. Rockefeller Jr . and Mrs. Cornelius J. Sullivan , she asked A. Conger Goodyear to head the Museum 's original organizing committee . As director they appointed Alfred H. Barr Jr. - who retired last January ( his successor has not been appointed ) . At its opening show ( November 1929 ) the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become some 3,400,000 admissions . When " Lillie " Bliss died about a year later she left the bulk of her collection to the Museum-with the canny proviso that the directors raise $750,000 . They did . Last year admission fees plus other income paid about 40% of Museum expenses . <P> Pre-eminent in its field , the Modern Museum has become one of the most imposing of U.S. public utilities . First housed in a single floor on Fifth Avenue , it moved into its modern 53rd Street residence in 1939 . Its Modern Architecture exhibit ( 1932 ) was the most comprehensive view of such workers in the International Style as Germany 's Walter Gropius , France 's Le Corbusier , the U.S. 's Raymond Hood . In 1935 , it successfully arranged the American canonization of Vincent van Gogh . In 1936 , its Cubism and Abstract Art show was a glamorously complete record of the quarter-century since that September Morn of cubism : Marcel Duchamp 's Nude Descending a Staircase . In later shows the Museum assembled Fantastic Art , Dada , Surrealism , the works of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lusty , callow , sometimes triumphant U.S. art .
