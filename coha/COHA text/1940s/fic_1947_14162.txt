No curtain and scenery are required . Three comfortable chairs and a small table . At the players ' right is a table or board on which there are three colored lights : red , blue and green . They are worked on dimmers . Leonora enters and coming to the front of the stage addresses the audience . THORPE My name is Leonora Thorpe . I 've been asked to come here to tell you about a practical joke I played on a friend of mine  --  on my sister-in-law , in fact . Some of you may think I was a little cruel . Perhaps I was . My sister-in-law , Belinda Watson , has always been full of fears about people and full of sweeping judgments about those she wants to meet and those she does n't want to meet . On this occasion I lost my patience with her . I decided to plant a brand-new prejudice in her mind  --  just to show her how susceptible she was to nonsense . While we act this out I 've asked some electricians to operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various emotions that were going on inside Belinda Watson during this session . ( During the following explanation the lights are turned up as they are described . ) This light is red . It 's for fear and it needs no explanation.This blue light indicates despair  --  bewilderment , confusion and despair . It denotes that state which we all get into when it seems that thinking is too difficult ; that thinking never gets us anywhere ; that reason and justice are simply too complicated ; that it 's easier to give up and just attack.So this last light is green  --  that 's the last resort of fear and despair : that 's malice and snarl and bite and attack.This thing took place in a friend 's house in the town where we all live . There 'd been an auction for some benefit  --  Visiting Nurses or Boys ' Clubs . Hundreds of people had been there . In fact , it was the first time that I 'd felt that our whole community had gotten together in a friendly way and had really met one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the veranda to sit down and rest . I 'd been one of the auctioneers . ( She sits down . Enter Belinda , fanning herself with an auction program. ) p. 3 WATSON Well , dear , it 's been a great success , a really great success . And I 've shaken a great many hands that I hope I never shake again . I know they 're very nice , I hope they 're happy , I hope they eat three meals a day , but let them lead their lives and let me lead mine . THORPE Now , Belinda , I 'm too tired to listen to you protesting about how broad-minded you are . WATSON Well , I am . You 're always scolding me about what you call my prejudices . You 're wrong . I 'm the most broad-minded woman in this town . As far as I 'm concerned : color , religion , rich or poor  --  makes no difference to me . THORPE Good heavens , here we go again . WATSON It 's only when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every association that they make to be of the very best . I do n't want them to get into any situation that might be embarrassing  --  ever . THORPE I know . And for that you have that infallible instinct of yours to guide you as to who is or is not suitable for them . Let 's not talk about it . WATSON Well , after all , you 're their aunt . You must see what I mean . THORPE ( Sitting up : ) Yes , I 'm their aunt , are n't I ? p. 4 WATSON And you 've said a thousand times that they 're perfectly beautiful children . And , of course , you have a certain responsibility to them , too . After all , little Leonora 's named after you  --  she looks like you , she dotes on you . ( Leonora has risen . She walks about and is seen to be forming a decision . Standing behind Belinda 's chair , she says : ) THORPE Belinda , I noticed something odd this afternoon . I wonder if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Smith and his brother and sister . WATSON Which ones ? THORPE Belinda , do you happen to know many people named Smith ? WATSON No.  --  Yes , I know a few . Why do you ask ? THORPE ( Sitting down : ) Well , dear , have you ever noticed anything funny about them ? WATSON Funny ? How do you mean ? ( The red light begins to glow ) THORPE Oh , well , if you have n't , I 'm sorry I mentioned it . After all , you have enough to worry you as it is  --  to bring up the children and everything . p. 5 WATSON What were you going to say , dear ? THORPE Forget it .  --  My , what an attractive dress that is . Have I ever seen that before ? WATSON Yes , it 's new .  --  No , I mean it 's an old thing I 've had for years . But what were you going to say about the Smiths ?  --  Now , Leonora , if there 's anything I ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THORPE Well , it 's nothing really . Yet I feel that it 's something everybody should at least know about . Have you ever really stopped to think about the name Smith ? WATSON No-o-o-o . What do you mean ? ( A brief flare-up of the red light ) THORPE Before the War , I read a paper by a famous German scholar  --  oh , a very great scholar  --  about the Schmidts in Germany . And of course , they 're the same thing as our Smiths . WATSON Yes ? THORPE Do n't you see ? They 're all descended finally from blacksmiths and ironworkers , are n't they ? WATSON I suppose so . THORPE Swinging great hammers all day . WATSON You mean ? Leonora , hundreds of years have gone by since p. 6 THORPE So you do see ? This professor studies thousands of them . You must have read it ; it was in all the magazines . Naturally , they 'd be very strong willed and ruthless , would n't they ? Heartless , really . WATSON Leonora ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Driving nails into poor horses ' feet all day . Twisting white-hot iron into the strangest shapes . Well  --  that 's all I meant . WATSON Goodness ! But , Leonora what should we do about it ? THORPE The only thing for us to do is to know it and to keep our wits about us . WATSON To think that I never , never thought of that before ! THORPE Of course , there are some nice Smiths  --  WATSON ( Sudden strong burst of red light ; sudden cry : ) But the principal of my boy 's school is named Smith ! ! He seemed perfectly nice . THORPE Oh , I do n't deny it . But listen : a nice Smith is still a Smith . You keep your eyes open , dear  --  you 'll see . Take another example  --  come nearer , dear , we must n't talk so loud . Take that woman who sings on the radio  --  Rose Smith or Bessie Smith  --  what 's her name ? p. 7 WATSON Why , I always thought she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blue light begins to glow . The red light off ) THORPE Yes , but look at how famous she is ! To arrive at a position like that , my dear , one must be strong willed , believe me . Why , do you realize that Al Smith almost became president of the United States ? WATSON But , Leonora , the principal of my William 's school is named Smith . ( A brief return of the red glow ) THORPE Now you 're beginning to misunderstand me . There are lots of perfectly nice Smiths . WATSON Oh , dear , I 'm almost sorry that you told me all this . It 's so upsetting . ( Brief intensity of blue ; then back to blue glow ) Really , one does n't know what to do or to think these days . THORPE The answer to that is this : Do n't try to think , just know what you know , trust to that instinct of yours , and keep your eyes open . You 'll see the Smiths behaving in very Smithy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of Who could have been kinder and better than Dr. Buckingham Smith ? THORPE Oh , yes . The one who was so kind to your mother all through her illness ? p. 8 WATSON He was an angel , a perfect angel . ( Strong blue light ) Oh , Leonora , it 's so hard to I mean , it 's really hard THORPE Of course , it 's easiest just to distrust them all WATSON ( No lights on ; pause ; then thoughtfully : ) Do you know something ? ( Green light begins fully ) I never did really like that school . THORPE Oh , Belinda , you 've always been very enthusiastic about it . WATSON No . From the first day I saw it I knew it was n't right . Fortunately I have an instinct for such things Of course , William admires this Mr. this Mr. Blacksmith . THORPE Smith , dear , Smith . WATSON ( Green reduced to red glow : ) Whatever you call him . William admires him , but , of course , William 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll speak to Wallace about it tonight . THORPE About what , Belinda ? WATSON ( Green light full for a moment ; harshly : ) Why , about taking William out of that dreadful place , of course . I 'll speak to him about it this very night . ( Enter Arthur , carrying a teacup. ) p. 9 ROGERS ( Remaining at back of stage : ) Oh , there you are , Leonora . Can I bring you ladies some tea ? ( All colored lights off . ) THORPE No , Arthur , we 've had some . Arthur , I want you to meet my sister-in-law , Belinda Watson . ROGERS Happy to meet you , Mrs. Watson .  --  I 'll be back in one minute . ( Exit Arthur . ) WATSON ( Pleased : ) Why , who 's that ? He seems very nice man THORPE That 's old friend of my husband 's . That 's Arthur uh I 'm surprised you do n't know him . That 's Arthur Smythe . WATSON ( Quickly : ) What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THORPE S.M.Y.T.H.E .  --  Why ? WATSON Leonora ! ! ( Flare-up of red beside the green glow ) That 's the same as Smith , is n't it ? THORPE Oh , that 's all right . Everybody like Arthur . I 'm glad you 're going to meet him . WATSON Do you think it wise , dear ? ( Red glow ; green strong ) Really , I 'd rather not . p. 10 THORPE Now , Belinda , you 're getting hysterical . Arthur 's an exceptional person . Wonderful war record . And besides , he 's the best citizen in this town ; your own husband says so . He should get all the credit for the new hospital wing . WATSON ( Add brief full strength of blue light : ) But , dear , he 's one of those Smiths ! ( Arthur reappears ; he promptly drops his cup and saucer . ) ROGERS Confound it ! Holy blazes ! If I 'm not the awkwardest pigheadedest  --  WATSON ( Brief red flare ; pointing dramatically : )  --  Look at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dabs at the floor with his handkerchief . All lights off except a faint green glow . ) ROGERS Have I ruined this rug , Leonora ? THORPE Was there any cream in it ? ROGERS No . THORPE Then it 's all right . Come over and talk to us . ROGERS ( Crossing : ) Well , at last , I 'm very glad to meet you , Mrs. Watson . I 've been seeing your husband almost every day . In fact , I had lunch with him yesterday . p. 11 WATSON ( Flare-up of red light , then out ; very gracious : ) Did you ? How nice ! ROGERS Yes , I was complaining to him that Amelia and I had never had the opportunity to meet you . I asked him : What 's the matter with us ? ( Red and green lights begin to flicker on and off at medium strength . Belinda laughs nervously . ) Anyway , I think you 're coming to dinner with us next Thursday . WATSON ( Flickering continues ; charming : ) Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too bad ! I 'm so sorry , but we 're engaged on Thursday . ROGERS Sorry . However , we 'll hound you until you do come . ( Belinda laughs prettily . ) I believe my daughter Helen has been doing her algebra with your daughter Leonora . WATSON ( Red and green up : ) Has she ? Has she ? Well , I 've always believed  --  of course , I may be wrong !  --  that children should do their homework alone . I certainly hope that I shall have the pleasure of meeting Mrs. Black I mean Mrs. I mean Mrs. Smythe some day ; but my husband 's been overworking lately  --  in fact , he 's a perfect wreck  --  and we almost never go out in the evening . p. 12 ROGERS Oh uh what Mrs. Smythe is that ? THORPE ( Quickly : ) Oh , I know you 'll like each other enormously when you do meet . There 's no doubt about it . ( Red and green flicker at half strength . ) ROGERS Mrs. Watson , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a succession of colds all autumn . I suggested that just after Christmas he could go with my son Jim down to my mother 's house in Florida . WATSON ( The blue light starts flickering with the other two : ) Oh uh uh uh THORPE Oh , Belinda , it would do him a world of good . I 've been there ; it 's a perfectly beautiful place . They could be out in the sun all day . ROGERS Of course , I have purely selfish reasons for urging it , since my boy would have so much better a time with another boy along . WATSON ( All lights off , but a strong green ; rises : ) Mr. Smythe , I thank you very much , really very much . But our family has made the rule never to be separated . We may be unusual in that ; I do n't know . But I could n't let William It 's such a distance Thank you very much . p. 13 ROGERS That 's as you think best , of course  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably be telephoning your house tonight to ask about the weather . I 'm glad to have met you , Mrs. Watson . Perhaps Mrs. Rogers and I may hope to meet you  --  some day . ( Exit Arthur . All lights off . ) WATSON What did he say " Mrs. Rogers and I " ? THORPE What , dear ? WATSON Who 's Mrs. Rogers ? Why did he say " Mrs. Rogers and I " ? THORPE Why not ? That 's Arthur Rogers . WATSON But you said his name was SMYTHE ! Leonora !  --  Arthur Rogers ! Why , my husband thinks the world of him . How could you say that he was one of those Smiths ? THORPE Belinda , sit down . I have something to tell you . WATSON What an awful mistake ! Leonora , I might have hurt his feelings . THORPE You did n't hurt his feelings ; he merely thought you peculiar . WATSON Leonora ! THORPE Now listen to what I 'm saying , Belinda . Everything I 've told you about the Smiths today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense . p. 14 WATSON ( Weeping : ) I should n't have listened to you . THORPE Exactly ! You should n't have believed me . You have no infallible instinct at all . What you call your instinct about people is merely made of listening to nonsense like this . WATSON Leonora , I do n't know when I 'll forgive you . You 've made a fool of me in front of a perfectly nice man . ( Exit Belinda quickly . Leonora turns to the audience. )
