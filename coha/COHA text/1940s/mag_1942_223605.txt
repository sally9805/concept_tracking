Canada got a glimpse last week of Senator Albert B. ( " Happy " ) Chandler 's Military Affairs subcommittee , flying hellbent north on a rush-rush , hush-hush mission to learn the " truth " about Alaska . They were going too fast to see much , if anything , but reporters said they apparently were having a good time en route . Back from Alaska came two fighting Congressmen and Artemus L. ( " Di " ) Gates , Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air . One was a mum-mouthed Texan , Lyndon Johnson , recently returned from the South Pacific , where he was one of the President 's observers with General MacArthur . The other , Warren Magnuson of Washington , talked a little . His conclusions : " The war situation in Alaska is serious but not alarming . . . . The military plan is to pulverize Kiska out of commission or take it before winter . "
