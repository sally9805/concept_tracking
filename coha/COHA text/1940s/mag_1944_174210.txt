On the big-time golf circuit , there is no substitute for precision . And precision-even for such natural swingers as Samuel Jackson Snead-is born of practice and competition . Last week , teeing off on a rain-soaked course in the Portland ( Ore . ) Open , the drawling Virginian passed his first test since his medical ( bad back ) discharge from the Navy . Somehow or other , 26 months in the Navy had not hurt his game . " Slammin ' Sammy 's " drives , out of sight in prewar days , were longer than ever ; he twice made the green in two on the 552-yard 18th hole . His sizzling two-under-par 70 led the field past the 18-hole marker . With a 72-hole score of 289 , he cashed in a 100-to-1 chance , edging out Mike Turnesa ( 291 strokes ) and Byron Nelson ( 296 ) for the winner 's $2,675 in war bonds .
