After almost three months of shadowing and snooping , FBI 's quiet supersleuths in New York and Washington last week arrested five men and a woman on charges of conspiracy to violate the espionage laws . Promptly , the U.S. had its biggest State-secrets case of the war . <P> What distinguished it from World War II ' s other " spy " cases was the fact that all those arrested were U.S. citizens . The six : <P> Buffalo-born , Bryn Mawr-educatedKate Louise Mitchell , 36 , authoress ( IndiaWith-out Fable ) , pamphleteer and socialite leftist . <P> Ukrainian-born Philip Jacob Jaffe , 48 , wealthy Manhattan greeting-card manufacturer , who , along with Miss Mitchell , edited and published a little magazine called Amerasia , devoted to plugging the Chinese ( Yenan ) Communists and criticizing the Chiang policies which the U.S. State Department supported . <P> Manchurian-born Mark Julius Gayn , 37 , free-lance journalist specializing in Asiatic affairs . <P> Navy Lieut . John Andrew Roth , 26 , onetime Amerasia researcher , recently in the Office of Naval Intelligence .

Along with three others , he made a trip last summer to the Yenan Communists , was sent back to the U.S. when General Albert C. Wedemeyer took over from General Joseph W. Stilwell . He speaks Chinese fluently . <P> The Charge . Two days after the arrests , Under Secretary of State Joseph C. Grew and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover told a little of what it was all about . For some time , they said , documents labeled " restricted " and " top secret " had been disappearing from the State Department and other Government agencies-War , Navy , OWI , the Federal Communications Commission , and the supersecret Office of Strategic Services . Material from some of the documents had appeared in Amerasia ( which had used one OSS report verbatim ) and in Free-Lance Gayn 's articles in Col lier 's and the Saturday Evening Post . Some of the documents , said J. Edgar Hoover , had been found in the possession of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has also written for the Washington Post , the St. Louis Post-Dispatch , Newsweek and ( for a brief period ) TIME , freely admitted that he had used Government reports as background for his articles .

They demanded only the light penalty provided by the espionage law : two years in prison and a $10,000 fine .
