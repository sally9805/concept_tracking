The problem of the cuckoo was a step nearer solution last week , with the publication of Cuckoo Problems ( H.F. &; G. Witherby , Ltd. , London ) , an authoritative treatise on the somewhat wayward habits of large European and Asiatic cuckoos which lay their eggs in the nests of other birds , leave their young to be brought up by foster parents. * Author : the 78-year-old dean of British ornithologists , Edward Charles Stuart Baker , C.I.E. ; O.B.E. ; F.Z.S. ; M.B.O.U. ; H.F.A.O.U. ; H.F.H.O.U. ; F.L.S. ; J.P . <P> Ornithologist Baker 's interest in cuckoos began rather dramatically . " I was a very small boy , " he writes , " when I found my first Cuckoo 's egg in a Hedge-Sparrow 's nest in a Norfolk lane . It was a red letter day which synchronized with my first attempt to read The Origin of Species . Since then I have been filled with interest in Cuckoo 's eggs and Evolution . " <P> The cuckoo problem that most deeply engrosses Ornithologist Baker and others is : How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This problem is posed by the fact that some wise birds build nests with obstructive entrances for the express purpose of keeping out cuckoos . The cuckoo has developed several methods for outwitting these isolationists . Cuckooists recognize a First , Second and Third Method . In the First Method the cuckoo simply squats down and lays her egg . The Second Method is somewhat more complicated , comes into play when the cuckoo is momentarily baffled by a nest built in a hollow tree or other enclosed space with an aperture too small for her to enter . In this case the cuckoo just hangs at the entrance of the hole ( by clinging to the edge of the nest , a twig , or bark of the tree ) and lets fly . <P> It is the extremely rare Third Method , a kind of fourth dimension among cuckoo problems , that is still controversial . The Third Method is used when a cuckoo encounters a nest with a very small or tortuous entrance . Unable to squat or cling , the cuckoo flutters to the ground , lays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then poke her long bill and neck into the nest opening , and regurgitate . <P> Like most cuckooists , Ornithologist Baker does not claim ever to have witnessed the Third Method , but he believes that he has . <P> " When bird nesting in Bihar India , " he writes , " I was strolling alongside a high , dense cactus hedge when my attention was drawn to a bird female cuckoo flying up from behind over my head and settling on the ground about 25 paces beyond me . I ran up to within about ten paces , screened from her sight by a bush , and then saw she was sitting quietly on a small mound , back to me and quite motionless . Presently I saw her put her head down and her shoulders heave , as if she were being sick , and then immediately fly to a spot in the hedge a little farther on . Following her up I saw she had got to a nest of the Jungle Babbler and was sitting on the edge of it , but she flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found three eggs of the Babbler and one of the Cuckoo . I never doubted for a moment but that the Cuckoo had carried her egg to the nest in her bill and dropped it in. "
