EARNINGS The Way Down ? As the flood of year-end earnings reports tumbled from the ticker last week , the evidence piled up that U.S. industry had passed the war 's profit peak . <P> Profits are still lush , but the percentage of profit to the astronomical volume of goods turned out is sometimes astoundingly low . The New York Sun totted up the profits of 53 companies in 1944 , found that they were down 1.3% from the year before . More &; more it looked as if 1943 , and not the top production year of 1944 , had been the high-water mark . Higher taxes , wages and operating costs had taken the profit out of volume . <P> Down Rails . To no one 's surprise , the railroads were far in front of the downhill parade . Although the roads hauled more traffic than ever before , the Association of American Railroads sadly estimated : profits of Class-1 roads last year ( those with an annual gross of more than $1,000,000 ) were down to $660,000,000 , a big $213,000,000 under 1943 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gross income at a record high of $715,000,000 , its net profit dropped to $36,0000,000 , about 57% of the previous year 's . <P> But the shocker was Delaware , Lackawanna &; Western . Its fat profit of $4,689,000 in 1943 shrank to a picayune $87,000 . <P> Reason : along with other Jersey roads , it lost a tax decision to Boss Hague 's Jersey City , had to pay out $4,932,000 in interest on back Jersey taxes . <P> Down Steel . The profit trend was down in steel , too . U.S. Steel shipped about $2 billions during the year , the most ever , but its net slipped to $60,300,000 v. $62,600,000 . Jones &; Laughlin , Inland and Republic were down with Big Steel . <P> Bethlehem Steel bucked the trend , upped its net profit to $36,200,000 v. $32,100,000 . But this was due chiefly to a difference of opinion on how much the retroactive wage increase to workers would cost . Beth Steel 's Grace tucked away $6,500,000 for the wage reserve , while Big Steel 's Fairless put away $30,000,000 . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits : the packers . On sales of about $1,600,000,000 , Swift netted only $15,900,000- about i% . On nearly the same gross sales , Armour could not do even that well . Its profit of $11,300,000 was only three-quarters of 1% . <P> Up Oils . The oil industry alone still had the Midas touch . Wall Streeters guessed : industry profits were up about 25% in 1944 over 1943 . As an example , they pointed to Atlantic Refining Co . It netted $14,700,000 , up 37% . Unlike the rest of U.S. industry , the big oil companies can still increase profits with volume because refineries , for example , are largely automatic , cost little more to run at capacity than at 75% of it . <P> <P> Note of Cheer . If high taxes and costs have put a ceiling on profits , businessmen may still extract one note of cheer : the same taxes may help to cushion the shock to profits when volume falls . <P> In normal times , a sizable drop in gross meant a sizable drop in net . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its volume trimmed by " shifts in war production " so that its gross profit was cut by $7,910,000 . But its tax bill dropped also , some $6,050,000 . Thus , net profits were down only $880,000 . <P> Keeping this fact in mind , many a businessman expects that profits will hold up fairly well under the comparatively small cutbacks planned for V-E day .
