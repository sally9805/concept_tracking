For 400 years , bullfighting has been Lima 's favorite spectacle . The great Pizarro , according to tradition , killed the first bull in a fight before the cathedral in the Plaza de Armas ; the old Lima bull ring , built in 1765 , is said by Limeos to be the world 's oldest . But never has Lima known a fighter like its own Conchita Cintron , the world 's greatest female torero and mistress , to boot , of the art of rejoneo ( bullfighting with a short spear from horseback ) . <P> Back in Lima last month after a Colombian tour , 24-year-old Conchita , a slim , trim blonde with unforgettably cold blue eyes , was the talk and toast of the Peruvian capital . U.S. Ambassador Prentice Cooper stopped her on the street , introduced himself , gladly shook her tiny , calloused hand . Twice she fought in the ring-and brilliantly . She might have appeared oftener ( at her usual $12,000 fee ) , but she was annoyed that Lima 's new 30,000-seat bull ring , for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still unfinished . <P> Limeos remember Conchita as a wiry tomboy who , at eight , learned riding from the great Portuguese rejoneador , Ruy da Camara . He taught her also the bullfighting art , first in Peru , later in Portugal , where she appeared in a ring at twelve . For eight years now she has fought in the big time-in Spain and Portugal , in Mexico , Venezuela , Colombia , Ecuador and Peru . <P> Conchita has evolved her own special act , which has been accepted by many orthodox aficionados . First she meets the bull on horse . Glacier-cool , she keeps in the path of the charging bull " until the last moment , then skillfully maneuvers her superbly trained mount aside . Still on horseback , she digs the beribboned banderillas into the bull 's hide . Then she hops on to the ground for conventional cape work . Occasionally Conchita stoops and kisses the bull between the horns . Her explanation : " It is a gesture of triumph , like a rooster crowing over the dead body of its opponent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit , in Quito . Ecuadorians jammed their old , wooden bull ring . Some even sat on the roof . Although the first bull was sluggish ( dulling Conchita 's artistry ) , the judges awarded her both ears . She passed one to the crowd , threw the other away . Aficionados understood : she knew she had not earned a trophy .
