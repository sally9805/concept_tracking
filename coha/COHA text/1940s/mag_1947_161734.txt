( See Cover ) <P> Gandhi 's toes were blistered . As he walked the flower-strewn paddyfield paths of eastern Bengal last week , through lines of Hindus and Moslems who wept and knelt to touch his bandaged feet , other Hindus and Moslems in distant Bombay chopped at each other with long knives . Twenty-two people died in the Bombay riots , including some Untouchables who were caught in the middle . <P> While Gandhi preached love and nonviolence to the Bengalis , an old jailbird named Vallabhbhai Patel , who calls himself " a blind follower of Gandhiji " and whom the British Raj had imprisoned eight of the past 16 years , had 40 Indian Communists , whom he hates , clapped into jail . <P> In short , everything was as usual in India , where the people are more fertile than the land and the paradoxes are more fertile than the people . India 's pullulating contradictions obscured the view at a moment when it was more important than ever that the world understand what was going on in the seething subcontinent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian Congress ' Purna Swaraj ( complete independence ) resolution of Jan. 26 , 1930 , India was almost completely free of Britain but in danger of lapsing into anarchy . The infant country faced these problems , among others : <P> Hatred between the Hindu and Moslem communities , which flared last August into the Great Calcutta Killing when 6,000 died , has now hardened into a grim struggle over Pakistan . <P> Rising prices and falling production have intensified the conflict between millions of the poorest and some of the richest people in the world . Strikes are bubbling all over India . Communist power is rising . The Congress Party is likely to split into right and left groups and the Moslems face a similar division . <P> While Gandhi continues to attack industrialization , some of his most devoted followers go ahead with plans to make India the industrial heart of Asia . <P> Freedom for India does not affect the princely states , where 93 million ( 25% ) Indians live . These are more or less despotically ruled by an anachronistic group of princes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5.8 wives , 12.6 children and 3.4 Rolls-Royces . Sooner or later a free Indian nation will have to deal with them ; right now the Communists are advocating expulsion of the princes . <P> Power Is the Spur . To bring under control this vast interplay of seemingly irresistible forces and immovable bodies would take more than the fanaticism of Moslem Leaguer Mohamed AH Jinnah , more than Jawaharlal Nehru 's eloquent idealism , more , perhaps , than Gandhi 's combination of mysticism and manipulation . India needed an organizer . It had one . Gandhi listened to God and passed on his political ideas to Vallabhbhai ( rhymes with " I 'll have pie " ) Patel ; Patel , after listening to Gandhi , translated those ideas into intensely practical politics . <P> Patel has no pretensions to saintliness or eloquence or fanaticism . He is , in American terms , the Political Boss . Wealthy Hindu and Parsi industrialists ( like C. H. Bhabha , Patel 's son 's employer , who has just become Works , Mines and Power Minister ) thrust huge campaign funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patronage , and ceaseless work , he has built a machine that touches every one of India 's conflicts . In every fight his objective is the same-power for India .
