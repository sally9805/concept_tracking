txt United States ports , the best in the world , are going to be a lot better . Plans are under way for spending millions of dollars over the next few years to improve them . The purpose : To facilitate movement of shipping in and out of harbors ; to speed up loading and unloading . New York City 's approach to the achievement of this purpose sounds like a paradox . It will get along with fewer than its present 202 piers . There 's a lot of financing to arrange yet , but over the next five years 36 piers are slated for demolition ; only 21 will replace them . Horse-and-Dray Traffic Out But the new dockage will be up-to-theminute It will be double-decked . Its 100- to 150-foot width will provide ample room for today 's freighter-size trucks to maneuver in : most present New York piers , as narrow as 75 feet . were built for horse-and-dray traffic . Overall , port authorities see a much speedier traffic movement despite the fewer number of piers . San Francisco talks again of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " World Trade Center . " This challenge to New York for shipping supremacy would be spread over a dozen blocks . It would be built around a 30-story skyscraper . Surrounding buildings would include terminals for air , bus and truck traffic . But water shipping interests  --  exporters , importers and manufacturers  --  would occupy most of the structures in the development , which would face the ocean . There , the impetus to shipping that the center would provide would bear fruit in replacement of many present docks with new ones , it is expected . Big Plans for Boston Boston plans $25 million improvements to its docks over the next decade  --  if the Massachusetts legislature will approve the funds . Meantime , it tries to hammer home to shippers the argument that its present dockage is superior to New York City 's Its man ' point : That all its main piers have rail heads reaching into them : lighters are n't needed for moving goods as on many New York docks which are n't served by tracks . Say some Boston shipping men : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell it to industry " Houston is building two tunnels under its Ship Channel to accommodate vehicular traffic . The purpose is to get rid of the ferries that now choke the narrow channel and obstruct shipping . Mobile . Ala , is waiting for the State Legislature to approve funds for a $4 million outlay which will give that port three new ship berths to supplement the present 22 . Salesmanship is being called on by some cities in a bid for shipping business which is rapidly expanding as mounting production from U. S. factories looks for an outlet in foreign markets Norfolk , Va , is considering sending emissaries through the Middle West to herald the advantages of its ports . The Boston Port Authority has two full-time " travelling salesmen " beating the bushes to drum up trade , and it has three branch offices doing the same job in New York . Washington and Chicago . Seattle advertises the " expanding port of Seattle ' with six-column ads in a local newspaper . Today 's Big Job But for many ports the immediate probl.rn is not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overflow business . Trucks with loads consigned for export create a daily traffic snarl which extends for blocks along New York City 's waterfront South and West streets . Mountains of imports grow ever higher on San Francisco 's docks . Some importers there say they have to wait four months to get merchandise cleared . New York City hopes that the answer to the truck jam on its waterfront will be found in a Port of New York Authority project on which construction will probably start this month . This is a $5 million Union Truck Terminal in which truck shipments to the piers will be consolidated so that cargo intended for one ship will he brought to it in truckloads . It 's the fact that many trucks have driblets of loads to deliver to several ships that causes the present congestion . The San Francisco port jam got its start when the long maritime strike hacked up incoming cargoes . Seven Customs appraisers have been trying to free them . But port people say 15 more are needed to clear all the imports and keep them moving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being engaged , it believed .
