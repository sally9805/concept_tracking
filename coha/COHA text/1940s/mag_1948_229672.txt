FLORA &; FAUNA <P> Assorted animals got caught in the shifting gears of human ingenuity last week . Some results : <P> In Ringwood , County Hampshire , England , a blear-eyed Friesian cow named Bridge Birch yielded 41,952 pounds of milk in 329 days to displace ( unofficially ) an American Holstein , Carnation Ormsby Madcap Fayne , as world champion . Bridge Birch 's owner admitted that his cow got a daily diet-booster of half a gallon of stout . <P> In Labrador , a team of dog paratroopers made a practice jump on orders of U.S. Colonel Paul A. Zartman , Goose Bay airbase commandant . Zartman 's idea : harnessed to a dogsled ( which can also be parachuted ) , dogs can haul human chutists on difficult Arctic rescue missions . The tests proved that the dogs knew what to do with a grounded chute . Crowed an airman : " Instinctively , the dogs run to the chute and sit on it . " <P> In Manhattan , Robert L. Kendall , president of the American Feline Society , proposed shipping 50,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks from rat attack . Under the Kendall Plan , only " healthy and vigorous work cats " would be inducted ; all would become " government wards . " Cried Sydney H. Coleman , executive vice-president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals : " The cats could not exist on rodents . . . . They would need supplementary feeding which people in these countries could not give . . . . We are vigorously opposed . . . . "
