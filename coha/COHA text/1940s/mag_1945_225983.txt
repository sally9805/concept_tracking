Not since January 1942 had U.S. surface ships pushed through the Strait of Macassar , between Borneo and Celebes . The last time . they tried , the cruisers Houston and Marblehead were damaged and driven off by overwhelming Japanese air power . But by last week the wheel of Pacific war fortune had turned full cycle : an Allied invasion fleet steamed southward past captured Tarakan and into the Strait , brushing aside a Jap air attack . <P> Off Balikpapan ( pop . 30,000 ) , richest source of oil in all of oil-rich Borneo , the gunnery ships steamed back &; forth for days , laying down the heaviest pre-invasion bombardment of the Southwest Pacific campaign . Overhead , where once heavy bombers of the Thirteenth Air Force had flown hazardous missions , unescorted , were clouds of Allied planes softening up shore defenses . <P> This week , as the final thundering rocket pattern scorched the beaches , rugged infantrymen of the Australian yth Division , veterans of the bloody Kokoda Trail , swarmed ashore . A spattering of enemy small-arms fire greeted them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide , half a mile deep . General Mac-Arthur went in with the fourth wave of the amphibious group under Rear Admiral Albert Gallatin Noble . Said the General : " I think today we settled the score of that Macassar Strait affair of three and a half years ago . " <P> Macassar Strait , ' he added , " is controlled by our surface craft as well as by air and submarine . . . . We have secured domination of Borneo . " <P> Meanwhile , the Australian 9th Division , fanning out from Brunei , had captured another rich oilfield at Miri , and virtually ended the 21-day campaign for the northwestern part of the island . At Tarakan , where Borneo 's liberation had begun on May 1 , the first fruits of victory were gathered by the Allies : oil flowed again from wells that had been scorched by the Dutch in 1942 , bombed by the Allies , scorched again by the Japs in 1945.                    @
