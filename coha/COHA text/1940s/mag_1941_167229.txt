Since 1937 , American Export Lines , Inc. ( steamships ) has been determined that its airline subsidiary would fly the Atlantic in competition with Pan American 's Clippers . Export 's ambition has been approved by President Roosevelt , CAB , the Army , Navy and State Department . But last year a $500,000 mail subsidy needed to start the flights was refused by both Senate and House appropriations committees . Last week Export again drew an emphatic thumbs down from the House committee . Since the company now must wait for Congress ' next budget bill to try again , and since every defeat makes a reversal less probable , it looked as if the transatlantic fight between Export and powerful , lobby-wise Pan Am had ended in a TKO.
