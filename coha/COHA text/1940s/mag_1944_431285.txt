In his memoirs , A Roving Commission , Winston Churchill relates how , as a young lieutenant in India , he endeavored to educate himself and to bring in order his own conceptions of the world . He attempted to settle and adjust for himself the contradiction between Faith and Knowledge . He was fond at that time of reading compilations of quotations and mottoes , and in one of these he came across the French saying , " Le cceur a ses raisons que la raison ne connait point " ( " The heart has reasons of which the reason is not aware " ) . He found that excellent , because it consoled him about certain conflicts in his inner attitude . For under the influence of freethinking books that he had read , his thinking had taken a decidedly secular turn ; he was dominated for a while by aggressively antireligious ideas . Or at least he thought he was . In reality , in the reality of life , or rather in the reality of life 's dangers , such dangers as he not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that whatever he might think or argue , when it came to the fire of the battle he did not hesitate to pray to God for protection , nor did he hesitate to thank God out of a full heart when danger was past . It is understandable that he was tempted to be ashamed of this contradiction . But the French proverb confirmed what he himself already had felt more or less clearly ; namely , that a lack of logic here was no reason for self-contempt . He found that it was foolish to sacrifice the speculations of the heart to those of the mind . He insisted upon his right to be permitted to rejoice in both , without being embarrassed over the fact that his faith took one turn and his thinking another . " It seemed good , " he writes , " to let the mind explore so far as it could the paths of thought and logic , and also good to pray for help and succour , and to be thankful when they came . I could not feel that the Supreme Creator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be offended if they did not always run smoothly together in double harness . After all , He must have foreseen this from the beginning and of course He would understand it all . " The confessions of the great Englishman have the naive directness of the man of action . But I , who can by no means boast of naivety , feel for them a measureless sympathy . When he says that he never could understand why the bishops of his country and the clergy in general made such a to-do in an effort to make the Bible story agree with the knowledge of modern science ; when he asks why on earth do they want to reconcile them ; when he declares , in short , that he has always believed what he wanted to believe , while at the same time he let his reason pursue free and unfettered whatever paths it was capable of treading ? all that seems to me exceedingly plausible , healthy , human , and decent . And in particular , as far as the Bible , the " Holy Scripture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my relationship to this at once most strange and most mighty monument of the world 's literature , this mountain of a book , which as it were has grown together out of the rocks of different geologic epochs , this massive conglomerate word-colossus , which though created by a hundred fabled , anonymous , pseudonymous , and more or less historic authors , has become a whole , and of which therefore we can very rightly call God the author ? that my relationship to this Book of Books agrees completely with that of the clever young lieutenant of Bangalore . A novel on which I have spent one and a half decades of my life has led me fairly deeply into the sphere of Bible criticism and of rational Bible science . Historically , I know my way about in this curious work ; if I let my intellect alone speak , it tells me that this book could not be in the literal sense " God 's Word , " that it could not have sprung from verbal revelations ? that is to say , that it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its holy authors . What , looked at from only a rational point of view , is the Bible ? It consists of a mass of very different and undeniably uneven literary products of Judaism and ancient Christianity : myths , sagas , short stories , hymns and other poems , historic reports , treatises , letters , collections of pronouncements , amendments of law ? the authorship of which , or rather the writing down of which , extended itself over a very long period of time , from the fifth century before Christ to the second century after Christ . Yet , certain parts have their origin even beyond this period , farther back in history : they are boulders and fragments of gray antiquity , which lie in this book like huge foundlings . On the other hand , certain descriptions of Jewish antiquity contained in the Bible are definitely colored by the wishes and the ideals of the epoch in which they were written down . It appears that the editing of the stories of the ancestral fathers must be assigned to the times of the Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the longing for the gentleness and peacefulness of life , whereby the original stories have taken on the character of a pastoral idyl . And in the New Testament , that part of the Scriptures we call the Gospel according to St. John is a relatively modern product , obviously influenced by Greek thoughts , and it is as good as impossible that the speculating theologician  | who wrote the Fourth Gospel could be the same as that disciple of the Lord lying on Jesus ' breast , " even though he asserts such an identity . Even less has he author of the Apocalypse in common with this disciple , this evangelist John . Tohn of Patmos was a Jew-Christian , . living in Asia Minor at the time of Nero , who , racked by fevered dreams , sent his secret revelation " as an open letter into ; he world . This letter met with mystic success , a success that has continued through the centuries , and renews itself always in times of religious crises and social afflictions . I say all this in order to point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which the Bible consists . And yet all of them , above all , the holy scriptures of the Jews , the Old Testament , which was originally written in Hebrew ; and the biographies of Jesus with their apostolic comments , the New Testament , which was originally written m Greek ? these all have grown together into a unified edifice , one whose power to influence the soul is incalculable . Nothing compares with it ! There it lies before us , this Bible ; in all the languages in the world it has become the book par excellence , whose back is broader thanthe back of any profane printed matter , with its gold-framed leather covers , its enormous pages encrusted with gilt , its peculiar arrangement of type not to be found anywhere else , its numberless chapters , verses , and commentaries , its strange maps and pious illustrations . IT HAS become the consecrated knowledge of man and his God , the chronicle of humanity , the planned history of salvation , the abode of questioning in sorrow and in gladness , the fountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clear . It is a calendar of instruction and of comfort , a homily , a textbook of the recurring feasts , whose great , unmistakable cadences you hear in all the stages of human life , at baptism , at marriage , at funeral . Long links of human generations have impregnated this mighty book with piety , with trustful confidence , with exploring devotion , with respectful love . It is a possession of the heart that the criticism of the mind can neither pilfer nor touch . In these last rooted-up decades , all of us have asked ourselves anew the questions about man ? whence he comes , where he goes , what may be his position in the universe . The question has become a concern of mind and religion ; though it is a question incapable of answer , a problem destined to remain a secret , yet it is a secret to which the thinker , the anthropologist , the antiquarian , the paleontologist , the theologian , the political philosopher , the poet ? every one in his way and with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a time in which a new sympathy for the unique , difficult , and highly precarious position of man is developing in the minds and hearts of the best of us everywhere , and we feel that such a new sympathy , such a new humanism will be a fundamental moral condition for the great task of rebuilding the world . If I ask my readers to go back to the Book of Books , it is because I am convinced that it is an inexhaustible source to inspire and to strengthen this humanly uniting feeling .  |
