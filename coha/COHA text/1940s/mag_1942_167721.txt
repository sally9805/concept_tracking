( See Cover ) <P> Inside a modest brick house at 2374 Massachusetts Ave. , Washington , D.C. , is a lot of very useful military information-but no U.S. military man knows much about it . On the walls inside hang military maps , showing in detail the dispositions of Japanese troops in China and all southeastern Asia . On chairs inside sit several men whose heads are crammed with information about the Japanese Army , how it operates and how it fights . <P> These men know all this and a lot more useful information , but the U.S. Army has not the benefit of it , for the simple reason that , in the six weeks that it has been available , no high-ranking U.S. Army officer has taken the trouble to call on the telephone or knocked at the door of 2374 Massachusetts Ave . <P> In that house is the Chinese Military Mission sent by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to help the U.S. plan and coordinate campaigns in the Far East . Head of the mission is General Hsiung Shih-hui , a quick-witted , rugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chuh , the Gissimo 's nephew . Several of them speak as well as fight Japanese . Most of the members have known the Japanese intimately in battle-for five years past . <P> When they arrived on April 13 , the mission delivered their letters of introduction , dropped cards on the proper authorities and rented a house . Nothing happened . Two weeks later General Hsiung issued a statement to the press in which he very pointedly said that the United Nations may not win " unless there is a unified strategy covering all theaters of operations . " No one took the hint . <P> The East had arrived but the West was too busy to bother . The twain did not meet until this week , when some of the mission were finally allowed to sit in on a session of the United Nations High Command . <P> It was about time . The U.S. Army could not ignore the fact that the Japanese had started a new campaign to crush China . It is a campaign which has far better chance of success than the lesser drives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Burma but also because of all the Far Eastern catastrophes since Dec. 7 , 1941 . <P> Today the Japanese have the choice of attacking Australia , Siberia , India , Hawaii , Alaska-or China . They may soon attempt one or more of these invasions , but one certainty is that the battle for China has already begun , with more troops than Japan used in Malaya , the Philippines and Burma combined , and that Japan has new and impelling reasons for seeing it through to a finish . <P> Knock Out the Runway . Since Jimmy Doolittle 's deed of April 18 , the Japanese have been quite naturally obsessed by fear that the United Nations will use China as a base for large-scale bombing attacks on Japan , as well as on Formosa , Hainan , Indo-China and other Japanese outpost bases . Particularly suited for such use would be the peninsula of Shantung Province , which reaches out toward Japan like an angry fist , and the great bulge of Chekiang Province , within four-motor range of half of Japan . <P> Shantung has supposedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the Japanese recently felt it necessary to throw some two divisions into a careful mopping up of Shantung . Last week the Japanese announced that this mopping up had been accomplished .
