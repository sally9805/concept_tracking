 | IN THE WORLD of the future , " a rocket research man told me , " we can probably send mail by rocket across the Atlantic can . Such rockets , traveling thousands of miles r hour , could make the trip in perhaps 40 minutes . Because of the difference in time ? e tween Europe and the United States , mail ! raving at 1 p. m . Paris time would arrive in New York at 9 a. m. eastern standard timet , ur hours earlier ! " Fantastic ? Not so much as you might think . The German V-2 rockets shot across the English Channel against London reached a maximum velocity of more than 3,600 miles per hour , or 6,000 feet per second , which is five times the speed of sound . Mail already has been carried by rockets over short distances in Europe . Such transatlantic rockets wo n't come right away , but the mere fact that they 're being talked about shows how science is remaking - ur world and scrambling our old ideas of geography . The Age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of atomic power , ushered in when the first tremendous atomic bomb exploded over Japan . The awful power of the atom bomb is the same almost inconceivable power that keeps the universe running , the same energy that has kept the sun and all the other stars burning and shining with terrific heat for millions if years . This energy is what holds together the infinitely small cores , or nuclei , of atoms , the tiny building blocks of which all things are made . When atoms are broken up , the energy is released . So far , we have learned to extract this energy only from the atoms of one kind of uranium and a few other elements . When these atoms are smashed , the source of this colossal energy of the universe is partially unleashed . The atom bomb explodes in a way comparable to setting off a whole chain of firecrackers by lighting the fuse of the first one . A tiny neutron , fragment of an atom , is shot into the nucleus of a uranium atom . The atom breaks into two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core . They smash into two other uranium atoms . These in turn are broken , and the neutrons that fly out from them explode four more uranium atoms . These explode eight more ; and so on . This fast " chain reaction " explodes many atoms at almost the same time , releasing terrific explosive power ( page 395 ) . In the world of the future the energy of atoms may be harnessed , replacing , at least to some extent , the use of coal , oil , or water power . A few tons of uranium could do the work of thousands of tons of coal or oil in operating big industrial plants , light and power systems , or battleships and ocean liners . " But first , " one scientist told me , " we must learn to control atomic power . In the atomic bomb we have learned only how to release this power . It 's like the difference between gasoline in a barrel and gasoline in an automobile cylinder .

Even today you can do it in 55 hours . In five years many commercial aircraft will be flying at 400 miles per hour , as fast as most fighter planes of today . At that speed , and allowing for the difference in time between the east and west coasts , you could leave New York at 6 a. m. and still get to Los Angeles in time for a 9 a. m. business date !

The Future of Television Here is how the future of television is seen by Ralph R. Beal of Radio Corporation of America : " It will be no trick at all to glance across the country . New Yorkers , after seeing the sun go down over the Hudson Palisades , can watch it set again three hours later by television over San Francisco Bay .

With FM ( frequency modulation ) radio you 'll hear your favorite symphony or opera with far greater perfection . FM brings you the full range of high and low notes audible to the human ear , from the bass drum 's deep boom to the piccolo 's squeal . FM does away , too , with static , fading , and station interference . Quick Trips to Far Places These are just samples of the things to come . It will take time for all of them to come true , but think what they will mean in terms of opening up the world 's remote corners , annihilating time and space , getting alien peoples acquainted , putting new life in that overworked phrase , " international understanding .

In big new postwar airplanes , you 'll be able to go to Europe on an ordinary two weeks ' vacation by flying to London or Paris in nine hours , overnight . You can fly both ways or fly only one way , if you wish , and travel by steamer the other , to get the relaxation of an ocean voyage . Some of the transoceanic planes may carry 75 to 100 passengers in luxury , or up to 200 passengers with less elaborate accommodations . Some planes will have small " club ? car " lounges and may have even a few staterooms . Schedules already worked out call for flying to Moscow or Rio de Janeiro in 19 hours , to Sydney , Australia , in 42 , to Singapore in 43 . Fares will be comparable to first-class rates on steamers .

Many have been greatly enlarged and improved . Some are in remote places , off the beaten track , but around many of them new settlements and trading centers of the age of flight may grow up . Here at home the big new Boeing C-97 , transport version of the B-29 bomber , already has flown across the United States nonstop in six hours and four minutes . You can best appreciate this speed from a passenger 's description : " One hour out of Seattle we were over Lake Coeur d'Alene , Idaho . Two hours out , we were south of Great Falls , Montana ; three hours out , the Missouri River was crossed at Mobridge , South Dakota . We caught the lights of Chicago through a high , thin overcast when we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In another half hour we were streaking south of Toledo , Ohio .

" But even this speed is slow compared with those in prospect when the new jet-propelled aircraft are further developed ( pages 386. 390 ) . Jet-propelled fighter planes in existence today can outstrip any plane powered by propellers and gasoline engines . They can do this because propeller-driven aircraft cease to be efficient when their propeller tips reach the speed of sound ( about 1,200 feet per second ) . Jet planes do not have this handicap . * See " American Wings Soar Around the World ... by Donald H. Agnew and William A. Kinney , NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE , July , 1943.  | High as a Three-Story Building , the Hughes Flying Boat Hull Will Hold a 60-ton Tank Seen from the halfway point looking aft , its size is indicated by the men 's figures .

A jet plane has no propeller . It is driven by its reaction to a jet of hot gases which shoots out through an exhaust pipe in the rear . It works on the same principle that makes a rifle butt kick against your shoulder when you fire . Hot gases coming out of the gun barrel force the gun back in the opposite direction . In the jet plane the outward flow of hot gases is continuous , so that the plane moves steadily through the air . Air is scooped in by the jet airplane as it flies , is compressed , heated by burning with fuel oil , and the resulting hot gases shoot out in the rear . Before the hot gas is ejected , it also turns a turbine which operates the air compressor . Jet motors may eventually be built for use on commercial airplanes . At first they probably will be used only on high-speed planes making few stops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postwar airplanes away from danger , are predicted by aviation engineers . They may also be used to warn ships away from dangerous coasts . Guided by radio beams and other radio aids to navigation , airliners are expected to arrive and leave as regularly as railroad trains , despite thick fog or snow . Airplanes will be able to fly in almost any kind of weather because icing will be less of a problem , thanks to new ways of heating wings , tail surfaces , and propeller blades , which already are in use on military aircraft . Airplanes operating over long distances will fly at high altitudes where they will be above much of the bad weather and can take advantage of favorable winds . Some will operate at 30,000 feet or more , but inside their " pressurized " cabins the passengers will breathe air compressed to the equivalent of an altitude of 8,000 feet or less , so that they will suffer no lack of oxygen or discomfort from fast climbs or descents.  | Iurt Schell h .

Games have been televised from here for five years . Sports events are likeh postwar subjects for television ( pages 388 , 404 ) . A new , safer aviation gasoline now exists , which will reduce the danger of fire in both private and commercial airplanes . You can drop a lighted match into this gasoline and it puts out the flame ! The new gas , developed by Standard Oil Company ( N. J. ) , is safer because it does not vaporize until heated to a temperature of 100 ? Fahrenheit . Except in very hot climates , this temperature is seldom reached on the ground and never in the air ; so there is less danger of gasoline vapor being ignited accidentally , either while a plane is refueling or in flight . Vaporized in the engine , the fuel burns as efficiently as regular 100-octane gasoline .

But our shrinking world will alter some old travel practices . Airliners on nonstop flights overseas will start direct from inland cities such as Chicago and Detroit as well as from such seaboard points as New York or San Francisco . " It is likely that air transport will make great changes in world trade and travel routes , " says William A. M. Burden , Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Air . " For example . the old overland caravan route for trade from Turkey across Asia to China and India was abandoned when invention of the mariner 's compass made it possible to sail cargo ships around the Cape of Good Hope . But , paradoxically , with the development of the airplane , that old Asiatic overland route is again coming to the fore .

" It may mean , too , that more American salesmen will be boning up on Russian , Chinese , Spanish , Hindustani , or other languages . " One airline official said to me : " Our line does n't plan to operate overseas after the war , but of course we 'll fly regular schedules to Hawaii and Alaska , because they 're part of the United States . " It did not seem at all strange to him that the crossing of 2,400 miles of water to Hawaii is now just a " domestic " hop , not " overseas " any more !

So heavy is airline traffic expected to become that it is predicted that airport control towers will have radar devices showing on screens the relative positions of all airplanes within a radius of 25 miles . Control points on the ground and planes in the air will be equipped with radio-operated devices and distance indicators showing how high planes are and how far they are from other planes .

The bed is made up before the train leaves and slides away in a recess until you want it . Then you pull it out and climb in whenever you please ? no waiting for the porter to make up your bed , no climbing a ladder to the upper berth , no cramped undressing in bed . Private rooms always have been available on trains , of course , but were comparatively expensive . The duplex-roomette will sell for little if any more than the present price of a lower berth .

At night three berths , lower , middle , and upper , will be made up above the seats . They will resemble present Pullman berths , but will sell for a much lower price . These newer-type coaches already operate on some trains . You 'll probably see more streamlined trains , built largely of aluminum alloys or stainless steel .

Your postwar auto will be much like the prewar models at first , but improvements are on the way , stimulated by lessons learned in war . One reason why British fighter planes won the Battle of Britain in 1940 was that their engines burned 100-octane gasoline , better than the fuel the Germans had .

With so many men ? and women ? trained to fly during the war , many more private planes probably will come into use , and experts say they 'll be safer , simpler , easier to fly Eventually almost every small town is expected to have its own airport . Aviation people forecast a demand for up to 400,000 private planes soon after the war ends . As yet , however , aviation authorities say . there 's no cheap " family airplane " in sight .

But , in a way , you 'll hardly need to travel when all the amazing devices of electronics get into full swing . " Electronic Age " Is Here All the modern wonders of aviation , television , radio , and many other fields are made possible largely by the new , fast-developing science of electronics . Scientists say we are entering now upon the " electronic age . " You 'll be hearing a lot about electronics . It is a potent force in remaking our world . Already it is opening up all kinds of new jobs , products , gadgets , industries . ' Your boy may want to become an electronics engineer , repairman , or salesman when he grows up or returns from war . What is electronics ? It is essentially the harnessing of the electron , just about the smallest particle of matter in the universe ? so small that 30 thousand trillion trillion electrons weigh less than one ounce . Everything is composed of atoms , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of atoms . They are also particles of electricity . Once harnessed , they can be put to work and made to do all manner of things . Electrons are harnessed in the electronic tube , which is essentially the same as the tubes in your radio set . With the electronic tube it is possible to detect electrical impulses too small and too weak to be seen , heard , or felt by any human means and to amplify them up to the point where they are strong enough to operate radio loud-speakers , television receivers , or complicated machines . This is done by controlling the flow of electrons inside the tube . The electrons flow from a heated filament across to a metal plate . This Bend Down , westinahouse Electric Corporation Sister , Open Your Mouth , and the Electric Eye Will Turn on the Water Leaning toward the drinking fountain , the girl cuts off a beam of light between two uprights . Thus she breaks an electric circuit flowing through an electronic tube in one upright and signals a tiny motor to turn on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as turning on lights , opening doors , sorting cigars ( page 400 ) .  | electron flow is a real electric current , although it passes through space instead of along a wire . The electron flow goes through a metal screen , or grid , which acts like a valve , or gate , stopping , starting , or varying the electron flow . A small change in the " opening " or " closing " of the grid makes a big change in the flow of electrons through it . That is how amplifying is done . For example , tiny , weak radio impulses , coming in over the air , flow through the grid of a radio tube . These weak impulses are multiplied 25 billion times before they are transformed into the current operating the loud-speaker . Wonders of the Electric Eye You can put an electronic tube in an electric circuit and control the flow of current more speedily and accurately than by any other means . The grid in the tube can start or stop the current with greater accuracy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can measure time in thousandths of a second . It can control hundreds of thousands of watts of power passing through the circuit with only a tiny fraction of a watt of power applied to the grid or valve . Electrons also are harnessed in the photocell , or electric eye ( page 399 ) . In it electrons are made to boil out of a metal by shining a light on it . The meta : is potassium , very sensitive t light . When more light strikes the metal , more electrons flow out ; when less light falls on it . fewer electrons flow . Since this flow of electrons is also an electric current , you can vary the current by varying the light . Photocells do all kinds of work . For example , a door car . be made to open when you walk through a beam of light falling on a photocell . This breaks the beam , the electron flow in the photocell stops for a momentt .

Newest proposal for broadcasting radio and television programs may do away with the need for relaying the signals every 40 miles or so , however . This plan calls for several large airplanes circling at altitudes of 30,000 feet above various parts of the United States . The planes would receive television and FM radio signals beamed upward from ground points and rebroadcast them back downward .

Meanwhile an electric impulse is going out continuously from the camera . When the electron beam hits a black area in the picture , this impulse is weak ; when it hits a gray space , the signal is stronger ; when a white spot is scanned , it 's stronger still . The impulse thus varies in strength with the highlights and shadows of the picture . On the receiving end , another electron beam picks up the impulses and transforms them back into light , on a fluorescent receiving screen . On this screen the electron beam paints a black spot where the incoming signal is weak , a gray spot where it is stronger , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way a picture is built up , bit by bit , reproducing the picture picked up by the camera on the sending end . The secret of television is that all this happens literally at split-second speed . The whole picture is recorded in the camera , sent out , and reproduced on the receiving screen 30 times every second . It happens so fast you do n't see the process at work . A complete picture , Scorch Your Shirts ? a Sun Lamp ! Original whiteness is restored by dampening them and placing them under an ultraviolet-ray lamp that forces moisture back into the parched fibers of the cloth .

Eventually it may be done in three dimensions pictures with depth . Television will change our lives in numerous ways , many not now imagined . People may rearrange their living rooms so that everyone can sit and watch the television screen . You 'll see as well as hear candidates for office when they speak , and the effect on politics may be tremendous . Millions of school children may see and hear the best teachers via television . Television " Commercials " Regular programs will be broadcast by television stations , as radio programs are now , and special events will be put on the air ( page 394 ) . When a big fire breaks out during the evening , for example , portable television cameras will be rushed to the scene and you can watch the blaze from your armchair while it 's happening . If the fire occurs after midnight , while you 're asleep , movies of it will be taken instead , and these pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast next morning . " Commercials " on television will have more appeal , since they 'll be mostly pictures . I saw some experimental ones . To advertise a new unbreakable glass , a man hit the glass convincingly with a hammer . A girl , advertising soap flakes , showed how her brand made more suds than " ordinary " flakes . Pretty models demonstrated how to apply leg paint . Television will open up many new jobs . careers , and industries . Your boy or girl may want to go into television as an entertainer . director , or servicer . Already there are courses in television program production being offered at Yale , Columbia , New York Universities , and others . A television studio uses a combination of stage , film , and radio technique ( page 392 ) . The stage is smaller than that of the average theater , to fit into the field of the camera .  | U. S.

Two or three huge cameras , trailing snaky coils of cable , pick up the scene simultaneously from different angles , rolling forward for a close-up or back for a wider view . The director chooses which picture will be " on the air " at any one time . Television pictures have crossed the Atlantic Ocean , but so far only under exceptional conditions . That was when signals from England , traveling out into space , struck an unusual condition in the upper air on a few occasions and were reflected back to earth to be picked up by receivers in the United States . Present ocean cables can not carry television signals . But television could be relayed by radio across the 55-mile width of Bering Strait ; so sometime there may be a link between North America and Siberia and so on across Russia and Europe . Then , perhaps , Americans could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress of Soviets , or watch the Moscow ballet and the British Derby . Our European friends could watch a Texas rode ; or see the American Congress during debate on some great international issue . Long-distance Dial Phones Thanks to electronics , telephoning also will have improvements . You 'll be able , eventually , to dial long-distance calls direct . Lexington , Kentucky , already plans to install a system on which local and toll calls both may be dialed . Telephones will be extended to more farms , camps , and other remote places by use of radio . Experiments are under way in telephoninc with micro-waves , or very short radio waves . which may make it possible to talk direct to any person you wish without a wire connection and without interference . Another wonder of the electronic age is the electron microscope , which makes it possible  | In 11 Seconds This Electronic Heater Thaws Three Pounds of Frozen Cherries Usual methods would take two to three hours and impair the fruit 's freshness .

Under its enormous magnification a dime would appear a mile in diameter , a human hair like a giant redwood tree , a blood corpuscle as big as a two-foot pillow ( pages 400 , 401 ) . With the electron microscope scientists have learned what the extremely small viruses of influenza and other diseases look like . They have seen the beneficial bacteriophage viruses which attack disease germs in the blood and have watched how they work . A scientist of the RCA Laboratories measured these viruses and found they were 500 atoms long ! Molecules have been photographed , though they are only about , of a millionth of an inch in diameter .

Pictures also have been made of the malaria parasite in the salivary gland of a mosquito , at the stage when the next person bitten would get the parasite in his blood. * Wonders of Electron Microscope With the electron microscope it is possible to see particles 50 to 100 times too small to be seen in an ordinary microscope . Objects can be magnified 5,000 to 10,000 times their actual size , and by photographic enlargement this can be increased to 100,000 times . * See , in the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE for February , 1944 , " Life Story of the Mosquito , " by Graham Fairchild , and " Saboteur Mosquitoes , " by Harry H.

Health and sanitation in the world of the future are expected to be better than ever before , thanks partly to progress made during the war . The average life span in the United States could be increased by ten years if all presently available health and nutritional knowledge were adequately utilized , without a single new discovery , according to Surgeon General Thomas Parran of the U. S. Public Health Service . ' Better Health and Medicine Penicillin , developed under war pressure , and the sulfa drugs help arrest infections . New vaccines are able to immunize against tetanus ( lockjaw ) , influenza , scrub typhus , measles , and meningitis .

Sterilizing lamps , whose rays kill germs in the air , may be installed in hotel lobbies , railroad stations , auditoriums , and other places where people congregate , to reduce transmission of colds and other infections . Air entering large buildings will be cleaned with the " Precipitron , " developed by Westinghouse scientists , which charges particles of dust , smoke , and dirt in the air with electricity and then attracts them out of the air stream . Smoke , dust , fumes , and particles as small as 1/2,500,000 of an inch can be taken out of the air in this way . In night clubs , restaurants , and meeting halls the Precipitron keeps the air clear of tobacco smoke ( page 393 ) .

When sprayed on walls and ceilings , DDT kills flies and mosquitoes that alight there for three months or more afterward . Sprayed in cattle barns , it kills flies soon after they touch the treated surfaces and will help to keep down fly-borne diseases like typhoid fever and dysentery . It kills fleas on dogs and cats and is effective against lice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden and crop pests . But scientists are treading with caution in their use of DDT , because it kills many useful insects as well . If sprayed or dusted indiscriminately in woods and fields , it would kill bees and other insects which spread pollen , without which many crops , flowers , and trees could not reproduce and would therefore tend to die out . Frozen Foods Only at This Store I visited a store in Syracuse , New York , that sells only frozen foods . It had meat , poultry , vegetables , fruits , sea food , ice cream , dog and cat food , cooked dishes such as stews , hash , codfish cakes , and chow mein , and even frozen soups and orange juice in solid cakes . You could buy a whole meal there in frozen form . Many of the frozen food packages were on display in open-topped refrigerated cases , where customers could select their own . Food in the open cases stayed frozen because the cold air did not rise out of the cases as warm air would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war , and many more grocery stores probably will carry frozen foods . There are about 100 varieties of frozen foods now . Producers claim freezing retains the fresh flavor and beneficial vitamins and minerals in foods . Housewives of postwar days may be able to buy frozen dishes already cooked , to use at once or keep for emergencies when unexpected guests drop in . This is already being done on Navy planes flying the Atlantic . They carry precooked frozen foods packaged as individual meals and needing only to be heated for 10 or 15 minutes to thaw out and complete the cooking . Meals from famous restaurants and exotic foods from foreign lands may be frozen and sold everywhere . Busy women , it is predicted , may be able to cook the family 's meals ahead for a week and keep them frozen until served .  | Flying and Biting Bugs on Jones Beach Die in a Cloud of DDT , New Insecticide A truck-mounted fog generator squirts the poison , mixed with oil droplets , over a four-mile area of the New York City playground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprays , DDT routed dangerous disease-bearing flies and mosquitoes on Pacific islands . Dusted on almost the entire population of Naples . it killed lice and halted a typhus epidemic . DDT has a drawback ? it kills many beneficial and harmless insects , but does not kill all insect pests . Birds and fish which eat large numbers of DDT-poisoned insects may be casualties , too ( page 408 ) . Postwar refrigerators will have built-in freezing compartments where frozen foods can be stored ( page 402 ) . Farmers have frozenfood lockers in which to store beef , pork , poultry , vegetables , and fruits of their own raising . This may supersede home canning . In self-service grocery stores of the future you may shop for meat as easily as you do now for breakfast foods or loaves of bread . Instead of waiting for the butcher at the meat counter to cut and bone your meat , you may select your own meat , already cut , frozen , and packaged in convenient form , ready to take home .

There is n't room here to begin to mention all the postwar improvements in prospect . There are promises of radios you can put in your pocket , stockings that wo n't run , pants with a permanent crease , and , for tomorrow 's glamour girls , artificial eyelashes of nylon with a permanent " built-in " curl !
