The position of Henry Agard Wallace was much like that of the man who pursued a girl until she caught him . As far back as April , he had flirted publicly with the idea of a third party in ' 48 . He had carried on a cautious courtship all over the U.S. Last week she turned on him and he got a definite proposal . <P> The executive committee of the pinko Progressive Citizens of America ( of which he is carefully not a member ) urged him to run for President as an independent . If this move was calculated to set off a triumphal procession through the ranks of " liberals " and organized labor , someone had missed the cue . Actually , it started a spontaneous rush for the doors . Great segments of potential Wallace strength vanished in a storm of disaffection . <P> First to go was none other than P.C.A. 's cochairman , Columnist Frank Kingdon . At the closed meeting of P.C.A. 's executive committee in New York , ex-Preacher <P> Kingdon voted the only " no " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , but a " third ticket in 1948 is a pipe dream . " Besides , Kingdon was out for the regular Democratic nomination for U.S. Senator in New Jersey . <P> In San Francisco , Lawyer Bartley Crum , one of the attorneys for the ten Hollywood writers cited for contempt by Congress , resigned as a P.C.A. national vice chairman . <P> Then the big C.I.O labor unions were heard from . The powerful Amalgamated Clothing Workers , which , under the late Sidney Hillman , was the bulwark of New York 's American Labor Party ( and still is ) , said it wanted no part of a third party . So did gravel-voiced Joe Curran , president of the National Maritime Union . <P> Fresh from trouncing Communists in his own United Automobile Workers , Walter Reuther got up at a National Press Club luncheon in Washington and spoke the mouthful of the week . With a boyish grin , he remarked : " I think Henry is a lost soul . People who are not sympathetic with democracy in America are influencing him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They write your speeches , they do your thinking for you , they provide you with applause and they inflate your ego as often as necessary . " <P> At week 's end , about the only supporters Henry had left besides the P.C.A. were the Communist Daily Worker , Vito Marcantonio , Harry Bridges , and a fringe of other left-wing labor men . Six days after the proposal was made , Henry had not yet said either yes or no . But it was painfully evident to Democratic politicians that if he did form a third party , it would be bad for them , although not necessarily fatal . Republicans were jubilant : it would do them no harm whatsoever .
