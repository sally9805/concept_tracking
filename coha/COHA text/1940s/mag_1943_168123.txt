Out of Cape Town last week rattled a troop train bound for Sonderwater Camp , 1,100 miles away . It was packed tight with mulatto soldiers and most of them were full of high spirits soaked up in Cape Town 's cheap Jim Crow bars . <P> Not many miles from Cape Town , their spirits spontaneously combusted . At wayside stations they smashed windows of other trains , broke open fruit trucks , shattered hotel windows , damaged shop fronts , plastered white civilians with whatever their hooch-hot hands could find to throw . Near the Touws River junction , where locomotives are changed , the switch had to be made in the open veld : the crew was afraid to take the train into the station . As a train from the Orange Free State passed by , the mulattoes smashed long rows of its carriage windows with bottles and fruit . <P> At the dusty Karroo town of Laingsburg , armed police were waiting for the hotheads . The soldiers piled off the train , pushed through the police , began to move in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads , but they only laughed and went ahead . The next round killed one and wounded two . <P> The " Laingsburg incident " made inflammable hay for anti-war politicians , who hope to defeat Field Marshal Jan Christiaan Smuts 's pro-Allied Government in a forthcoming general election . In Parliament , British-hating , pro-Nazi Dr. Daniel Franois Malan , who leads the opposition to Prime Minister Smuts , solemnly denounced the " Smuts policy " of teaching non-whites to use arms , charged the Prime Minister with allowing " Communist agitators " to stir up the colored population . <P> Field Marshal Smuts is Prime Minister of a country split into sharp oppositions : pro-war and antiwar , pro-British and anti-British , 8,000,000 underprivileged natives and 2,000,000 privileged whites . Well aware was Jan Smuts that his few fair-minded concessions to South Africa 's colored majority could and would be used to make votes against his Government . Last week he gravely admitted : " As Commander in Chief I have been disgraced by some of my soldiers . This is a matter of first-class importance to the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
