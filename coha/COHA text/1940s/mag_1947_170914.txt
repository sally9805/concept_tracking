What was happening to the building boom ? By last week there were plenty of signs that in many cities it was turning into something resembling a bust . Although the construction industry has figured that there will be enough materials for a million new houses in 1947 , the Department of Commerce now estimates that only 700,000 to 800,000 will be built . And this seemed highly optimistic . Fewer permanent new houses ( 133,500 ) were started in the first three months of 1947 than in the same period last year . <P> The trouble was building costs . They had soared so high that they had scared away prospective builders . Even speculative builders were getting jittery . In the suburbs of many cities stood rows of tidy new overpriced houses , from $9,000 up , empty : 2,000 were waiting for buyers in Chicago ; 150 were vacant along the Worcester turnpike outside Boston . One Boston builder has 50 bright new houses which no veteran , or anyone else , turned up to buy in the 60-day period following completion . In Denver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autos . <P> On Long Island ( where new construction is only 20% of last year 's ) builders who begrudge paying commissions are willy-nilly turning their houses over to brokers . Houses are still selling fast in parts of the South and in Los Angeles ( average price : $12,620 ) . But in Dallas the News one day last week carried almost 18 columns of classified ads of houses for sale . Builders were still trying to sell houses , not rent them , though the housing situation was still as bad as ever . In San Francisco , Advertising Executive Kay Daly , 26 , used a billboard to help her find an apartment . Result : 93 phone calls ( 35 from other apartment seekers ) but no apartment . <P> <P> Trouble No. 1 . Detroit Builder George Miller knows why houses are n't selling : a house he could build in 1940 for $5,090 costs $9,990 today . The NHA index of building costs for a standard house stood at 137.4 ( 1935-39 average = 100 ) on V-J day ( see chart ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had in the previous six years . But the real shocker was the way costs had skyrocketed in the last six months . <P> The price of materials was half the trouble . Since 1939 , prices of all building materials are up more than 86% . But some important ones are up much more ; lumber is up 200% . However , there are signs that prices are leveling off ; and some are beginning to slump . <P> Trouble No. 2 . The second half of the trouble was labor productivity-and labor costs . Complained a Dallas builder : " Sometimes we think it takes two men now to do as much as one did in 1939 . " Masons who used to lay 700 to 800 bricks daily are down to 300 to 500 . Because they get time-and-a-half or double-time for Saturday and Sunday work , some Chicago building-trades workers like to knock off for two days in midweek and work on weekends . And wages , at an alltime high , are still going up . In Detroit , for example , where carpenters average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase . <P> Few apprentices were trained in the ' 305 , so most journeymen now are older men who simply can not do a hard day 's work . ( The average age of masons in Chicago is 58 . ) Builders agree that the productivity of most A.F.L. building-trades labor is only 50 to 60% of prewar . And there seemed to be little hope of much improvement .
