In the eighth-floor U.S. embassy office in Buenos Aires ' Boston Bank building , the telephone jangled . " Never mind the protocol , " boomed the voice of Juan Pern , " come on over . " After three months in Washington , big , breezy U.S. Ambassador James Bruce was back at his post . In answer to Pern 's call , he put other business aside , walked the four blocks to the Casa Rosada for a hearty abrazo and a long talk with Argentina 's President . In the next two days , he saw most of the country 's cabinet ministers , called twice on Foreign Minister Juan Bramuglia . <P> When Jim Bruce first went to Buenos Aires 21 months ago , about the only instruction he carried was to make friends with the Argentines . A convivial customers ' man and a millionaire ( National Dairy Products Corp. , Baltimore Trust ) , Businessman Bruce did as he was told . He got on joke-swapping terms with Juan Pern , hobnobbed with the cardinal primate and governors . Bruce became so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be embarrassing . A group of army brass once invited him to a meeting . Just in time , Bruce learned that they were plotting the government 's overthrow and wanted his advice . " This is one meeting , gentlemen , " he told them , " which I can not attend . " <P> The economic questions that plagued Argentina-falling production , lack of dollars , shrinking markets-were right up Bruce 's alley . Persistently , he used his backslapping sessions with Pern to dish out a businessman 's advice . Once he suggested that Argentina export more butter . " But we do n't produce enough butter to export any , " argued Pern . " If you will allow exporters a free hand in exporting butter , you would produce enough , " answered Bruce . <P> Last week , as the two men sat down together again , it looked as if Pern had begun to take some of the ambassador 's advice . The government had just announced that trade debts to U.S. banks , once over $300 million , had been cut to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applying against the debt one-fifth of the dollars the U.S. pays for Argentine goods . To stimulate U.S. trade , imports &; exports hitherto state-traded would be allowed to revert to private hands . Most important of all , Argentina would sell its crop surpluses at going world prices , instead of charging all that the traffic would bear . Jim Bruce felt that his mission had begun to bear fruit .
