txt GUARANTEES URGED The Company Demands Stringent Hire and Fire Rights and ' Security ' DESCRIBED AS ' BIG GAMBLE ' UAW Chief Asserts Proposal Would Mean No Increase for Some Hourly Workers By WALTER W. RUCH Special to THE NEW Yowl TIME ! . DETROIT , Dec. 18 ? The Ford Motor Company met a swift rejection today when it proposed to the United Automobile Workers , CIO , an increase of 15 cents an hour in wages in exchange for increased production and guarantees by the union of company security and stringent hire-and-fire prerogatives . The offer , which comprised , percentage-wise , an increase of 12.4 per cent on the average , according to a company representative , was declared to be " completely unacceptable " by Richard T. Leonard , director of the Ford department of the union , who promised a detailed rejection in a few days . A union representative assailed the proposal by the company as being " full of jokers , " and adding that acceptance of the wage terms , through the application of one of the so-called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some hourly paid workers . On the other hand , the company said that in making any increase in wages at all at this time it was taking a gamble . It calculated its stake in that gamble , assuming union compliance , at $33,000,000 . The company had stated earlier that with no wage increase , and an increase of 16 per cent in production , it would lose $35,000,000 in 1946 . Forewarned on " Tough Terms " Although forewarned that the " terms , though fair , would be tough , " union representatives were staggered by the Ford proposal , which was only a little better than that offered by the General Motors Corporation to settle its strike . They were prepared tonight to submit their detailed answer to the plan on Thursday morning , then recess until Jan. 6 or 7 , spending the interim in acquainting their constituents throughout the country with a frank accounting of the negotiations . Mr. Leonard and John S. Bugas , director of industrial relations for Ford , were still addressing one another with extreme cordiality , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was in contrast with the provocative dialogues engaged in by both sides in the UAW strike against General Motors . At some length , in a letter introductory to the detailed demands , Mr. Bugas said that on the basis of all that had gone before in the negotiations , the problem // had been put up squarely to the Ford Motor Company . He recalled company statements that now was not the time to talk about pay increases , and that a lift ? in OPA ceiling prices was not the " wise " way to approach an adjustment in pay . Mr. Bugas continued : " We have no alternative but to take a gamble . The management ' 1 of the company has done its best to calculate the risks in such a gamble . It has decided to risk an additional $33,000,000 . " Mr. Bugas warned that in throwing such blue chips on the negotiating table , the company would expect the union to throw in some of its own , four in number . Incentive Plan Described Three of these would provide for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders and participants , the guarantee of management prerogatives and the reduction of the number of union committeemen . As another condition , and by way of an incentive plan , Mr. Bugas said that the increase in wages would not commence until after the first month that Ford production had reached an output of 80,000 Fords , Lincolns , Mercurys and truck units . Then it would become retroactive to the first of that month , and would remain in effect for two years . Ford production in November was about 22,500 of such units , a company spokesman said . The fourth blue chip asked by the company , and perhaps the most important to the union , was a guarantee that if the Office of Price Administration should raise ceilings on Ford production such action would not be made the basis for additional wage proposals by the union . Mr. Bugas added : " We hope that you will find these proposals equitable and acceptable and that we can wind up our negotiations promptly . " The Ford suggestions were ade , ne declared , in the hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the confidence and cooperation of the employes the ability to stay in production , the sharpening of production skills and efficiency to stay ahead of competition , the breaking of the " log-jam " of post-war mass production and fulfillment of Ford 's share in halting inflation . Mr. Bugas went into a presentation of the details of the four blue chips . The wage offer was as follows : " The Ford Motor Company hereby proposes a wage increase of the equivalent of 15 cents per hour to all hourly rated employes of the company represented by the UAW-CIO , said increases to become effective at the beginning of the calendar month during which total unit production of the Ford Motor Company reaches or exceeds 80,000 units . Units shall be construed to include Fords , Mercurys , Lincolns and trucks . " The resultant rates shall remain in effect for a period of two years from the date they become effective and the amount herein specified shall include any adjustments which may be made for the purpose of adjusting inequities , eliminating spread , rates , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacation pay , overtime premiums or other adjustments in the total compensation of employes . " It was the latter paragraph of * ; he wage offer which seemed to be of more importance to the union . One leader explained that if it were interpreted literally , some workers against whom substantial inequities now operate might draw off so much of the 15 cents as to leave nothing for some other workers . Security Plan Explained The Ford version of a company security plan was substantially different from that presented by the company earlier and from that offered by the union . The latter suggested the dismissal of leaders of wildcat strikes and the fining of participants at the rate of $3 a day for the first offense and $5 for the second . The company had first proposed that the international union pay $5 a man for each participant in a wildcat strike . The company suggested today that the instigators of any wildcat strike be subject to summary dismissal , subject to appeal , with participants to be fined $1.50 a day for the first participation and $2.50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wages of the offenders and turned over by the company to the National Infantile Paralysis Foundation or such other recognized charity as the company may select . The company insisted that the union be liable to Ford for an equal amount of wage deductions as " liquidated damages , " to be taken from any amounts collected by the company for the union under the check-off provisions of the contract . Urge " Cooling-Off " Period The company also demanded the right to assign other employes to perform the work of employes participating in an illegitimate strike for the purpose of maintaining production and avoiding or minimizing interruption of the company 's operation . Providing for a thirty-day cooling off period in the event of a valid complaint by the union alleging a violation by the company of contractual provisions , the company asked the UAW to agree not " to participate in any strike until the specific issues in dispute have been presented to the management in writing and negotiation has continued with respect thereto for a period of thirty days , and until such strike action has thereafter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the union , upon the issues as presented to the company . " " In no event shall the strike take the form of a sit-down , stayin , slow-down or comparable curtailment of work as contrasted with a walkout . " Expressing its version of what constituted the " prerogatives of management , " the company said that it should retain " the sole right to hire , lay off , assign , transfer and promote employes and to determine the starting and quitting times and the number of hours to be worked , subject only to such regulations and restrictions governing the exercise of these rights as are expressly provided in this agreement .
