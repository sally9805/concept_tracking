Tycoon ( RKO Radio ) pictures the U.S. ideal of manhood as a construction engineer ( John Wayne ) who , like the steam shovel he strongly resembles , works all right when he is building things . But he looks absurd trying to speak English or kiss a girl . The U.S. ideal of villainy is represented in this movie as a Latin American rail magnate ( Sir Cedric Hardwicke ) who dresses for dinner , manages a compound sentence without stuttering , and tries to keep his lovely daughter ( Laraine Day ) from getting hitched to a steam shovel . <P> The film may have some suspense for Latin Americans , who conceivably will have difficulty believing that censors would permit such a marriage . For U.S. moviegoers , Tycoon has Technicolor . <P> The Eternal Return ( Paulve ; Discina ) . The medieval bards sang of Tristan and Iseult as huge , cloudy symbols of high romance ; later storytellers ( Swinburne , Wagner , Tennyson , E. A. Robinson et al. ) further enriched ( or corrupted ) the tale with new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cocteau , has handsomely reset the legend in modern dress . His title , The Eternal Return , is the term Nietzsche gave to the mournfully romantic doctrine of endless historical repetition . The Nietzschean note tolls through the film like a sunken bell . <P> Cocteau has transformed ( with much historical irony ) almost all of the serpentine story . The Cocteau version is about a young blood named Patrick ( Jean Marais ) , who runs off with his Uncle Mark 's blonde , beautiful wife , Nathalie ( Madeleine Sologne ) . <P> Cocteau has cleverly managed to waken the body of the legend to 20th Century life without rousing its spirit from medieval slumbers . His rattling flivvers and gleaming bathrooms are woven into the fine fabric of the ancient Tristan and Iseult legend like bright new threads into a shadowy old tapestry .
