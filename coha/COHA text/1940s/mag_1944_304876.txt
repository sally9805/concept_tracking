The first Socialist Government of Saskatchewan ( and the first in Canada ) last week found itself at war with Ottawa on two fronts-politics and money . <P> The King 's Man . When Saskatchewan 's 80-year-old Lieutenant Governor Archibald P. McNab asked to retire , Saskatchewan 's Socialist Premier Tommy Douglas proposed that the Federal Government consult him on the choice of McNab 's successor . Prime Minister William Lyon MacKenzie King 's reply was a curt , crusty no . <P> Douglas retaliated by announcing that as soon as McNab vacated the premises Saskatchewan would convert Regina 's $110,000 Government House into a home for the aged or for delinquent girls. * Then he had another idea : Let Ottawa instruct Saskatchewan 's Chief Justice to perform the Lieutenant Governor 's functions . <P> Ottawa was fish-cold to this idea too , and for a reason . In addition to purely social duties , the King 's representatives in the Provinces have one important function . They can refuse to assent to provincial legislation they believe to be unconstitutional and submit it to the Federal authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Premier " Bible Bill " Aberhart went off the legal reservation , the Lieutenant Governor held up some of his wild-eyed measures . <P> The King 's Money . Socialist Premier Douglas had given Ottawa a good reason to remember that precedent . He threatened to welch on a $17,500,000 debt . On the joint guarantees of the Dominion and Saskatchewan Governments , Canadian banks had advanced money so that Saskatchewan 's farmers could buy seed after the 1937 drought . It was Saskatchewan 's obligation to collect the money . Socialist Douglas proposed to collect only 50% of the principal from the farmers , give the Dominion a provincial I.O.U . for the balance . And to the Federal Treasury , which already holds some $75,000,000 of Saskatchewan notes , he added cheerily : " We are not concerned over giving the Dominion Government more treasury bills . . . . We believe that we shall soon have a Federal Government in power in Ottawa that will wipe out the treasury bills . " <P> What Premier Douglas forgot was that until the Socialists took over , the Federal Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saskatchewan ran out on her obligations , the Dominion could recoup by withholding Federal grants .
