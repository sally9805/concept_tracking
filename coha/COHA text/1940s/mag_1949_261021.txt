Sooner or later , every dollar spent by the U.S. Government must pass the watchful eye of ex-Congressman Lindsay Carter Warren . As the $12,000-a-year Comptroller General of the U.S. , Warren has frequently barked an alarm at war contract settlements ; he believes that " everybody and his brother were out to get the Government during the lush war years . " Last week , Watchdog Warren showed some real bite . In a report to Congress on war contract settlements , he accused federal agencies of " improper payment of many millions of dollars of public funds through fraud , collusion , ignorance , inadvertence or overliberality . " <P> Warren had found " excessive " payments of $11.5 million in 1,114 cases ( 12.1% ) out of 9,195 contract settlements audited . This was only " a small sampling , " and he could not " hazard a guess as to the entire extent of fraud and overpayment " in some $300 billion of war contracts . Even so , it was " a shocking situation . " In some instances , said Warren , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to Government officials , ' either directly , through their relatives , or through dummy corporations " owned by the Government officials . Other sample cases : <P> An Army officer told a friend the prices submitted by other bidders , and the officer 's friend underbid them to get a contract for $40,375 . When the contract was canceled , the bidder was paid $34,343.75 , although his " actual costs were only $7-053.13 , " and the officer went to work for his friend . <P> Two Army officers received shares of stock worth $2,000 in return for " part-time services " to a company that " shortly thereafter " obtained Government contracts of more than $100,000 . <P> Warren pinned most of the blame for overpayments on the Contract Settlement Act of 1944 , which permitted Government agencies to settle contracts in full before final auditing by Warren 's office . He had long advocated part payments , up to 75% , before final auditing . As it was , Warren had recovered $474,717 in " voluntary " rebates from overpaid contractors . More might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rot " devoted their efforts to defending the excessive settlements . " Last week , as Warren turned his evidence over to the Department of Justice for prosecution , Congress ordered an investigation of its own .
