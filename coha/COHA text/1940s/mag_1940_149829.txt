At last week 's end , some 20,000 draftees had gone to induction stations , been sworn into the Army of the United States , shipped to reception centres ( Draftese for Army camp ) . Nearly 99% of the 20,000 were draftables who had volunteered for one year 's training without formal drafting . At 29 reception centres rookies were shucked out of mufti , inoculated , vaccinated , shod and asked such questions as : " How many nickel cigars can you buy for 20 ? ' ' " How many dozen will 42 oranges make ? " , asked to say whether a pistol was a gun , a knife , a sword or a pencil. * <P> Such questions were part of Army 's new General Classification Test , streamlined lineal descendant of the World War I " Alpha " test , intended to help weed out hopeless misfits , keep pastry cooks from being assigned to blacksmithing duties or vice versa , bring to light bright boys who might make good officers . <P> This week , as in 1917 , high on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sergeants and second lieutenants , without which Army 's whopping training program may well founder . To get noncoms and shavetails in quantity , Army bosses may well have to junk some tenets of promotion by seniority . Stock Army retort to suggestions of promotion for merit has long been that such a system would encourage political toadying ; but low-bracket officers must be found , even if dull-witted veterans are passed over to commission brainy tenderfeet . To ferret out officer material , all rookies are being interviewed in Big-Businesslike detail as to their education , past occupations , talent for furnishing public entertainment , favorite sports . Queries are couched in folksy phrases . Occupational aptitude quiz : " Just what did you do ? " <P> Ability to label a pistol as a gun proved helpful for buck privates who wanted to gain chevrons , but was only a first step . Draftees now go directly from reception centres to tactical units which are below war strength . But after next March , they will spend 14 weeks at replacement centres now building , to learn something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good on the basis of their G. C. test and show leadership qualities will get a crack at commanding , may attain the status of " cadet " or " temporary sergeant , " wear not chevrons but an identifying arm band . Says the War Department : " The arm band will slip off and on with remarkable ease . " Those on whom the arm band stays longest may after nine months be admitted to Officers ' Training School , may one day substitute securely pinned shoulder bars for slippery bands . <P> <P> *Army apparently expected smarter rookies to identify a pistol as a gun . According to Webster , a gun is " any portable firearm except a pistol or revolver . "
