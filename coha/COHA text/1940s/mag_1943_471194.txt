Mr. Riegelman , who has been driving an American Field Service ambulance with the British Armies of the Middle East , wrote this revealing letter to his family on August 4th , when the British were still deadlocked with Rommel ' s army on the El Alamein line in Egypt. ? The Editors you will recall that my last letter was written from an area which was one of the few which we had missed in this part of the world , the Delta . We all hated it there ? there was little if anything to do and the prospects were bad indeed . The day after , however , we were ordered back to the desert , and glad we were to go . We stayed there for about three days getting our cars in shape for what was ahead and then early one morning we set out for the front . The unit to which we were attached were New Zealanders . The drive up was uneventful , and saved from sheer routine only by the fact that we got lost . Chan Ives ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dressing Station ? Roosevelt and his boys could take lessons from the British in the use of the alphabet ? thank God there are only twenty-six letters ) . From there we were led to the ADS ( Advance Dressing Station ) some nine miles nearer the fighting front . We pulled up there just in time to see everyone breaking for slit trenches . Fortunately there were several available for us and we literally dove into them just as the ack-ack ( antiaircraft fire ) broke out in its deep-throated rattle . I looked up to see a whole flight of Stukas just overhead and getting ready to dive . Then one peeled off and started down . God , how he came ! And what a racket he made ! I lay there for a minute waiting for the " garrumph " of the bomb ? it seemed like an eternity ? and then it hit ? and then another and yet another . The ground around me vibrated , sand was shaken down from the walls of the slit trench , and all hell seemed to have descended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really scared or frightened for an instant . Except under certain unusual circumstances , one is as safe in a slit trench against that kind of bombing as one can be . One bomb landed only about thirty feet away ? the explosion was deafening , and I was sure my car must have been hit , but aside from that it did n't particularly bother me . Then , as suddenly as it had started , it was over and the Stukas were away trying to avoid our ack-ack and we got up to see where we were . The raid 's objective had been near by , you will realize , but fortunately the bombs had been wholly ineffective . We gathered around the cook truck for supper ? we call it tea ? and the raid was n't even mentioned . ( Incidentally , my car was still intact . ) Later George Lester was sent off to an RAP ( Regimental Aid Post ) , where Bob Orton and I were destined later to join him . The RAP 's are simply three-ton lorries under the command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is usually supported by a Padre , an assistant , and a medical orderly ? all in addition to a couple of stretcher-bearers and a driver . Usually they are stationed within a few hundred yards of the particular unit they serve ; they form a part of the battalion and stay with it at all times . Buzzy and I were detailed to make a trip back to the Main Dressing Station . We got off shortly after dark , and it was pitch dark . We were being led by two of the ambulances of the unit ? big Austins ? whose drivers were supposed to know the way . We started off and I was in the last car . I could barely make out the outlines of the Austin in front of me although I kept only a few yards behind him . Suddenly he disappeared completely , and before I knew it I was plunging down a precipitous drop of about fifteen or twenty feet into a wadi . ( Wadis are sharp depressions in the desert varying in area from a few hundred square yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six miles across and ten or eleven miles long . Usually they are very sandy ? soft , clinging sand in which our cars are about the only ambulances around which are able to operate effectively ? that 's due to our four-wheel drive . ) In some way or another the leader had missed the entrance to the wadi and had simply taken a chance that nothing untoward would happen . It 's impossible at night to stay on any given path and if you succeed in getting anywhere near where you 're headed you'veaccomplished a minor miracle ? unless of course you know the country perfectly . The ADS had been moved that afternoon and these boys were navigating by dead reckoning . I hit the bottom of the cliff with a sickening crash . I had two stretcher cases and five sitters and the upper stretcher had broken . My heart nearly stopped as I realized that the man below had taken the full weight of the man on top . Amazingly , no one was hurt ; and after giving the two stretcher patients a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had broken , we proceeded on our way . We had n't gone far when the Austin in front of me got stuck in the sand . He forgot to blow his horn and the others did n't stop . I pulled him out , but by this time the others had disappeared . There was nothing for us to do but to try to find our own way . The Austin leading , we crept along , feeling our way around slit trenches and other miscellaneous impediments until finally we got out on the other side of the wadi . Then came the problem of finding the MDS . We had no real idea where we were , but knew that generally we should be going slightly north and east . We drove for another forty or fifty minutes ; then suddenly the Austin stopped . He had just avoided plunging into another wadi at the bottom of which five men were asleep in slit trenches . They tried to guide us and then came a disagreement . By lying flat on the ground we could silhouette the wadi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the left ? the other driver was set on the right . So we went to the right and suddenly he just was n't there . He had slipped off into the very wadi we had been trying to avoid . By luck and some clever maneuvering he had n't turned over , but he was hopelessly stuck . I got out and we reconnoitered the countryside and finally picked a spot where we thought it safe for me to try to get down there . I put the car in four-wheel drive and after a bad moment sueceeded in ending up on four wheels on the floor of the wadi . I hooked on to him and pulled him out of the sand and we again found our way to hard ground . Then we took stock and all agreed that we should go due east . " That 's east , " said the other driver , pointing due south . I pointed out the North Star and showed him where east was , confirmed it for him with my compass ( which has been invaluable ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We started along , narrowly missing a half-dozen slit trenches , any one of which might have wrecked us had we fallen in , and suddenly after about another three-quarters of an hour I saw a faint light flicker for just a second . It was the other crowd ? Buzzy and the other two ambulances from whom we had earlier been separated . They too had got lost . We decided that the only thing we could do was to bed down for the night . The MDS is only a small group of tents and a fifty-yard error would be enough to miss it completely . As we had no real idea where we were after four and a half hours of groping around , the decision seemed wise . Accordingly I dragged out my blanket roll and put one of my sitters on it and fixed up some extra blankets for another , and in some way the remaining three were able to make themselves passably comfortable in the car . I walked about for a while ? tried lying down on the roof of the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fender until dawn showed us the MDS less than a mile off to our right . It 's amazing how hard it is to keep on a bearing in the desert . You start out in a certain direction and until you 've learned the trick you will suddenly find yourself going in exactly the opposite direction . This ? even in broad daylight ? happens all the time until , as I 've said , you get used to following certain landmarks and learn the trick of desert driving . There are no roads of course and few tracks . One simply heads off into the blue and hopes to hit the right spot . II MHE next afternoon we were guided to a new Advance Dressing Station , somewhat nearer the actual front , and a Captain ( one of the finest men I 've ever met ) came around and took me away with him . That night we spent in a sort of foraging search . At one point we were very close to the most advanced of our troops . A couple of shells landed uncomfortably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shells and mortar bombs were landing all around the area we were in ? but hit nobody incidentally ? and the Captain just sat there directing me here and there as if he were looking for a nice place in Central Park to stop for a picnic supper . Gradually it got darker and so he decided that we had better get back to the ADS ? or at least near to it so that in the morning we could start out from a known location . I do n't mind saying that I did n't mind a bit . Well , we had just got back to the ADS when Jerry came over with his bombers . I could see two vehicles get hit about a half-mile away and I started for the farther one . On my way I had to pass fairly close to the nearer of the two , and just as I went by it began to behave as if it were the central feature of a July 4th celebration . It seems it was an ammunition truck and it sprayed its sundry contents all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hood of my car , but once again I was lucky . I picked up my first patient at the other truck ? and saw my first bomb-fragment wound , and put on my first shell dressing ? and it was not pleasant . I brought the man in to the ADS and saw that his wounds were properly dressed . He and several others were soon loaded on another ambulance and were sent away to the Main Dressing Station , where presumably they were operated on , given blood transfusions , and generally taken care of by the most expert men one would hope to find anywhere . The Captain told me to bed down for the night , which I did ? on a stretcher right alongside a slit trench . ( When we are at the ADS we do n't sleep in slit trenches , because Jerry does n't deliberately bomb a Red Cross area . When circumstances find us outside Red Cross areas we sleep in the slit trenches , and it 's amazing how well I sleep . When I think of the disgust with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to our April station when I had to sleep on a nice smooth bit of desert , inside a tent , in a sleeping roll with two or three cushions under me ? when I recall how I thought that this was the last word in discomfort and compare that night with the innumerable nights spent in a slit trench , with nothing under me but a blanket ? another on top ? my head half in the sand , and a more or less steady stream of sand running into the crevices between the rocks which poke into you at all sorts of odd places , I realize how far I 've come in the reshaping of my sense of values and ideas of bodily repose . ) The next few days three of us ambulance-drivers spent operating a sort of shuttle service between two Regimental Aid Posts near the front and the Advance Dressing Station . At times we were terribly busy , at other times there was little or nothing to do . During these quiet periods we got to know the men with whom we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but whose duties kept them in our immediate vicinity . A finer , more courageous , more gentlemanly group of men can scarcely be imagined . I 'm completely sold on them as people ? as fighters , as officers , as doctors , as friends and allies . One day I 'm going to visit their country . I stayed on this shuttle service for about eight days . Patients would be brought into the Regimental Aid Posts in lorries , staff cars , and tanks ? sometimes they would walk in when they were n't too badly hurt or if they were just sick . Sometimes the stretcher-bearers would carry them in . This last was very rare however , because usually they wouldget word back to us from wherever they happened to pick up a wounded man and we would go out and get them . You 'll understand of course that with every company of troops there are a certain number of stretcher-bearers who stay with them all the time . Whenever our company was shelled or treated to a bit of mortar or airplane bombing we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been wounded . It was the Medical Officer 's decision as to whether I should go out and just wander about looking for wounded or wait until called  - -  and his decision was usually dictated by such things as the probabilities of my actually finding anyone in need of my services , whether or not there was a telephone near where the bombs or shells had dropped , etc . He was rarely , if ever , wrong . Frequently I would go out , however , and then it was my job to pick up anyone who had been hit , put a tourniquet on if the wound looked as if it were necessary ( and I soon got to know more by instinct than anything else when it was in fact necessary ) , and then apply a shell dressing . Then I would bring the wounded man back to the Regimental Aid Post , where the MO gave him rudimentary first aid , dressed his wounds with antiseptics , and did what was necessary before the man was taken back for the more complete attention at the Advance Dressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , blood transfusions arc given and every effort made to cope with the inevitable shock reaction . There too minor surgical work is done before the man is again transported back to the Main Dressing Station , where they have the equipment and the staff for a complete and thorough operation . The emphasis is always on speed to the operating table . One day there was a terrific air raid ? by Dorniers this time ? and I actually saw the bombs leaving the planes as they flew overhead . I did n't like that , I can tell you , although I knew those bombs could never hit me . Jerry was bombing a nearby wadi where he thought there was an artillery battery . As a matter of fact he was right ? but he missed them all . As soon as the planes had passed overhead I was sent out to the spot . There I , together with four other AFS ambulances , cruised about until we were sure we had found everyone who had been hit . There were very few as a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put on stretchers , and with the help of one of their mates who had n't been hurt ( my orderly was n't around when I left and I was therefore alone at the time ) I got them on the ambulance . One had been very badly hit by a bit of shrapnel on his left side between the shoulder and the chest ? the fragment had passed right between his arm and chest and got him in both places . He had also been hit on his right side in two places . The other chap had only got it in the foot . Accordingly I slung the first-mentioned chap so that the MO could work on him more easily inside the ambulance and put the other one on the floor , from which his wounds could be treated from outside . So far I thought it out fairly well . But like a fool I put the upper chap on the wrong side , so that when the MO got inside to attend to him ? and he had to remove all the dressings I had put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I had been able to pick him up ? he found the worst of the wounds on the side away from him , making it terribly awkward for him to get at . He was awfully nice about it ? simply pointed out to me that next time I got a man with an obviously severe wound on one side , I should sling him with that side out . But I did feel like an utter dope not to have thought of that myself . On another occasion I was taking two sitting patients back to the ADS . As I was driving along I saw two Stukas apparently getting ready to have some fun about a half-mile ahead . Everyone around was running for slit trenches , and so I thought I had better do something about it . I noticed some slit trenches alittle to my right and drove to them as if I had been shot out of a gun . I told the two patients to get out quickly and get into the trenches ? and being seasoned soldiers , they did n't beat my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove the car a little bit away ? the one danger is the car getting hit and catching fire . If it 's near you when that happens it does n't make life any more comfortable . Then to my untold consternation I found there was n't a slit trench available for me . So I just dropped in my tracks ? like Pepper Martin coming into third base on a two-base bingle ? and waited for the bombs . Actually the first three or four were nowhere near us , and I was just beginning to wonder whether there were more to come when I saw something which made me lose all interest in the Luftwaffe for the moment . A shell burst about four hundred yards behind us , and as the smoke cleared away another landed about three hundred yards away and a line drawn through the two looked , at least , as if it would cross somewhere between my then very prominent Adam 's apple and my navel . It seemed to be no time to sit there contemplating the latter . I got the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks . I was making real time across the very rocky desert when I was flagged down by a staff car . It seemed that the second of the two shells had hit a man . So I turned around and went back and there found that not one but two men had been hit . One was an officer who was n't too badly off , but the other , a sergeant , had had his foot completely blown away . I put a tourniquet on , applied a shell dressing , and with the help of one of his mates got him into the ambulance . Then I attended to the officer and we were off again . All through it however the sergeant was trying to help me dress not only his own horrible wound but that of the officer . He showed me where the tourniquet should go ( and was right ) , he saw to it ( by leaning forward ) that I put the shell dressing on correctly ( and was right again ) . Then after I had got him into the ambulance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and was right ) . After being satisfied that everything was being done for the officer he started dictating to his mates as to what he wanted done with his sundry properties . This was to be forwarded by him to a certain " sister " ; that was to be given to Jim ; something else was to go to Jack , and so on . It was incredible . Then I discovered that I was n't exactly sure of my route ? I had been twisting about a lot and was afraid I might miss the RAP . The sergeant interrupted his tirade about getting it from a stray shell ( that it was such now appeared obvious ) to tell me to look around for a particular burned-out tank ? I told him I saw it , and he directed me to take a line from there to a lorry which I would see at the top of the hill and that if I bore slightly left of that I 'd hit the RAP . He was right . It was the most unbelievable exhibition of guts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever encountered or ever hope to see . His chief concern was for the officer , who kept assuring him that he was all right . Back at the RAP he kept up his directions to his men ( who had followed us ) as to the disposition of his gear , and never for a moment showed the slightest sign of anything but anger that he could n't look forward to another crack at Jerry . I 'll never forget that man ? nor will anyone else who knew him , I 'm sure . When I returned from taking him to the ADS , the Medical Officer said to me that he was very much afraid that the sergeant would die . It seemed unbelievable to me , but he said that when the shock hit a man like that there was little if anything that could be done . He was on the operating table within an hour of the time he was hit , but the MO 's prophecy proved sound . Despite everything that medical attention could do for him , he died a few hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given three transfusions ) , not from internal disorders , but simply from the shock with its devastating effect on a man with highly tensed nerves . Had he been the kind who was inclined to let himself go , had he been able to let his nerve escape him for a bit , he would have Iived ? but he was n't that kind of man , and I can tell you I felt very badly for several days . When a fellow like that gets it you ca n't help but let it become personal ; he was n't the only man I picked up in whom I took a really personal interest , but I think his death affected me as much as anything else out here . IIT cr STILL another day I came as close as I ever want to to getting my own one-way ticket . Some distance in front of us , as I 've said , were our most advanced troops . Beyond them was a fair bit of desolate desert and then Jerry . One night Jerry had been shelling these troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and get a man . The MO himself went with me , and in our efforts to get as close as possible to the wounded man as quickly as possible he allowed me to go up to a spot somewhat nearer the top of a little escarpment than on previous occasions . Jerry saw my car ? it was dusk and he could n't have seen the Red Cross ? and two shells screamed overhead and landed not more than thirty-five feet behind us . Why none of the shrapnel hit the car I 'll never know . The MO jumped out and simultaneously shouted to me to get the car back out of sight . I swung it around and drove it back about fifty yards and then dove into a slit trench . Shells were dropping all over the place , and yet the MO walked slowly out to where we could see a man waving . I yelled to him but he signaled me to stay where I was . After what seemed an interminable time I saw him starting back . There were four of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man we had seen waving carrying a second . I waited until they were nearly halfway back to the car and started the motor . I started to drive toward them but he yelled to me to stay where I was . Slowly and painstakingly they carried their stretchers to the car and we slung them on the hooks . The MO was going back for two more . I started to walk back with him but he would n't allow me to . " You stay with the car ? that 's your job ? and stay in a slit trench until I signal for you . " I protested to no avail , and again he made his way back across that stretch of open ground . Then from a slightly different direction I saw a man come running toward me ? he was screaming bloody murder , like a badly spanked child . I had heard of shell shock but I had n't seen it in the raw before . I ran out to grab him and forced him into a slit trench . He was sobbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though most of them were landing quite a good distance away . It was a tragic and helpless feeling sitting on the poor chap to keep him from bolting out of the comparative safety of the slit trench . Then I saw the MO starting back toward the ambulance and I grabbed Johnny I recog-nized him as one of the chaps who had been at the RAP a few days before with some minor complaint ? and holding him by his shirt , I forced him to run to the car with me . I got him inside and then got the car turned around just as the MO arrived with the last patient for the time being . And so we started back ? nothing more came near us , but I was extremely happy to get out of that particular bit of Egypt . Never , so long as I remember anything , shall I forget the sight of that MO , wholly defenseless and completely exposed , walking slowly out to those men and carrying them back . Such is the daily task of the stretcher-bearers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't in fact . Nor shall I ever forget Johnny . Just what happened to him we shall probably never know ? he was apparently alonein a slit trench when a mortar bomb landed very close by ; his nerves , strained and made raw by weeks of shelling and machine-gun fire , simply broke . It was an amazing sight-1 ca n't say tragic because somehow that was n't my reaction at the time . There was nothing by way of cowardice ; far from it ; he was known as one of the best soldiers in the unit ; and yet once his nerves had gone he cringed and yelled ; all the way back to the ADS he huddled down in the seat even when our own guns were the only things that could he heard ? when nothing was falling within thousands of yards . It was tragic ? of course it 's tragic to see a man completely shattered without having a mark on him ; but it was n't quite the same . I wish I could make you understand what I 'm trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason that I do n't quite know myself . I hope this letter does n't sound too egotistical ? it is n't so intended . I 'm trying to picture for you what this show has been like , and somehow one 's own experiences are the easiest described , and perhaps the most clear . Please , however , remember they are examples only . Much of our time was spent doing nothing . For long hours on end we would sit in our cars reading or playing gin rummy or casino ( when we were together ) . Much of our work was sheer routine ? but we were constantly waiting ; for it 's been our distinction to have been able to get the men back to the doctors more quickly than has ever before been possible ? at least in so far as the particular unit we were with is concerned . We have been told that so often that it seems beyond doubt . Being only one of a great many , I have n't any hesitation in saying that we 've clone well ? as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliments from very high sources . It 's partly because of our equipment ? our cars will go places and do things that are quite beyond any other ambulances out here . It 's partly due to our own freshness ? we do n't stay out there long enough to get so tired that our efficiency drops . Our normal time at the front is two weeks and then we are replaced and do n't get back for three to three and a half weeks . The interval is spent doing what I 'm doing now ? evacuating patients into Base in the town of Alexandria . IV O NE night I was asked to help at an operation . The patient had got an anti-tank shell right through his throat ? and another through his shoulder and part of his chest . There , at 1 a.m. , in a little tent not more than seven to ten miles behind the actual fighting front , a surgeon began to operate . He finished some two hours and forty minutes later . During that time he completely reconstructed the man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing his patience or presence of mind despite the obvious fact that the man might easily die at any moment ; he worked steadily and with infinite care . Three times he gave blood transfusions ( I incidentally holding the needle in the vein because he did n't dare fasten it for fear it might have to be moved at any moment in the event of a clot ) . Then he performed a tracheotomy in which he inserted an artificial windpipe ( perhaps one of your doctor friends will describe it to you so that you can understand what I 'm trying to picture ) , and then he had to do an intricate operation on the man 's shoulder and chest . I complimented him warmly when he had done ? and his only comment was to the effect that that man as well as three others upon whom he had operated that night owed their lives to ? guess who ? the American Field Service ! He was n't throwing lilies about at that hour of the night , under the pressure that was on ; he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then only for a minute to grab a cup of tea , and then at it again for another six hours . And yet his comment was that he had performed three operations already and had two more to do which he had never before had achance to attempt in the field for the very simple reason that the men had always died before they got to him . It was a very nice compliment . Yesterday we came out here and at the moment I 'm sitting in an ambulance , waiting to be called to make a run into the town some hour and a half 's drive to the east of us . The flies in this part of the desert are bad ? but they are nothing like what we had up at the front . There they were and are in such profusion that any description would simply not be believed . And now for a few reactions and things which I suppose you want to know about . The heat , intense though it has been , somehow has n't bothered me at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the other day George and I both thought it was about eighty and when we looked at a thermometer at the RAP we were amazed to find that it was well over a hundred and ten . I think the worst part of this experience was the tenseness the constant awareness that peaceful as things seemed to be , at any given moment a shell could land next to you without warning . It took me a little time to get used to that , but like everything else in this bloody mess , it becomes a part of one 's daily life . It was n't until we got back away from it that I realized how tense I had been . I think the strongest impression I have at the moment , the thing that is uppermost in my mind , is this : if the truly gallant fight these men out here arc making ? if the horrible suffering I 've seen ? the shattered bodies and decimated personalities ? if the courage and devotion and bravery and skill and determination ? if these things are again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down again ? if this is n't the war to end wars ? then truly mankind has no right to survive . I 've said again and again that I 'm not here to help regain the America of Hoover ? the England of Chamberlain the France that was and that feeling has become intensified to a degree that I ca n't put in words . Perhaps it 's because of the kind of work we do and the sort of things we see and the position from which we see them ? surely if there is any right as opposed to wrong , if there is any good as opposed to evil , this can and must be forever outlawed . If money ? as it may be , I feel and believe it with every fiber of my being ? alone out here . was demonstrated just a couple of years ago that our younger generation had been demoralized by skeptical professors , devitalized in spirit by the destructive criticism of intellectuals , and deprived of faith and courage by following after false literary gods ? What now of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at Bataan , on Guadalcanal , in the waters of the Coral Sea , and off Midway Island ?
