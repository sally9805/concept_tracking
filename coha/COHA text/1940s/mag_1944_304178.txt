What 's the Matter <P> Three of southern Italy 's antiroyalist parties proposed to call a ten-minute strike in Naples last week . Object : to protest once more against the British-U.S. alliance with dilapidated little King Vittorio Emanuele III and Marshal Pietro Badoglio . Specifcally , Italian antiFascists felt that Winston Churchill had let them down again in his recent declaration of Allied policy . Said Count Carlo Sforza : " In London they seem so busy mistrusting antiFascism that they forget . . . thousands of Fascists . . . eager to stab Britain and the U.S.A. in the back . " <P> There was no strike . Explained an anti-Fascist spokesman , the republican Action Party 's Prince Caracciolo : " We had to give in to precise orders from General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson . " <P> Nobody was happy . Allied control authorities felt that troublesome Italians had again put their internal politics ahead of a very troublesome war . Those Italians who cared at all felt that the Allies had once again demonstrated a complete contempt for everything the war was supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security officers in Italy move into newly occupied towns along with , or only a few steps behind , the front-line combat troops . The security men make a quick check on the townspeople , find out who were the Fascist leaders and send them back to the lines at the tail end of batches of German prisoners . It does n't take much detective work to uncover the town scoundrels . No overpowering display of authority is needed to get rid of them . <P> Yet the U.S. and British Governments , acting in concert , have failed to do the same thing with Fascists of higher rank . One reason for this failure-and for most of the specific mistakes in Italy-is that amateurs at European problems are attempting to deal with chaotic and revolutionary situations . A more basic reason is that Allied officials in Italy have no firmly laid-down and well-understood policy to guide them . <P> The Italians have heard Allied political advisers and generals make speeches about liberation , promise food for the civilian population , but the Italians have a certain Latin practicality . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . They are aware that Allied troops are liberating Italy only from the Germans-and are not doing that very rapidly . The politically conscious , democratically minded minority in southern Italy is aware by now that " expediency " is as much an excuse as a policy . <P> Militarily , Italy is an available place in which to fight Germans . Politically . Italy is a place where Britain and the U.S. have lost a great opportunity to build up European good will , to prove that the Allies really do know what they want , and that they know how to get it .
