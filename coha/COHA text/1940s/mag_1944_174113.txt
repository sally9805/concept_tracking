In Bed We Cry ( adapted from her own novel by Ilka Chase , produced by John C. Wilson ) is terribly modern , frightfully modish and stupefyingly dull . Playwright Chase has hand-tailored for Actress Chase the role of Devon Elliott , a manufacturer of haunting perfumes . Devon 's career is notable , her lure considerable , but her life somehow becomes a champagne bucket of ashes . Her husband loves her , yet leaves her ; her refugee swain loves her , yet has a girl in every flat . Seeking to blend Park Avenue with poignancy , brittle talk with amorous bruises , In Bed We Cry is much less a slice of life than a setup for an actress who wants to do everything from scintillate to suffer .
