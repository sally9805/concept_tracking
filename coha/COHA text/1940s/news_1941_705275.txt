txt The automobile industry is looking into the question of abandoning its annual new model shows during the period of the national emergency . The Automobile manufacturers Association , trade group representing all major automobile makers with the exception of the Ford Motor Co. , has sounded its member companies on discontinuance of the show . This was learned here yesterday . Motor company heads last week received telegraphic requests , signed by Alvan Macauley. president of the AMA and chairman of Packard Motor Car Co .. asking their opinions on dropping the show . If opinion in the industry seems to warrant the step , the AMA probably will make a formal proposal which will be voted upon by its members . Only the New York Automobile Show is formally sponsored by the automobile association . The regional shows are dealer affairs , in some cases having the assistance of the manufacturers . Directors of the Automobile Manufacturers Association at a regular meeting next week are expected to discuss the show question . Formal action , however , may await a more complete expression of opinion from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1942 automobile shows , which normally would be held this autumn on various dates through October and November in leading cities throughout the country , probably would not affect the model change programs under way . For many and perhaps the majority of companies , design improvements scheduled for the 1942 models are so far ad-danced that they will be largely or wholly completed before the industry 's tool and die makers will be needed on national defense jobs . In fact , some new models are so well advanced that they are likely to be introduced publicly long before autumn . Despite widespread belief to the contrary , the bulk of automotive tool and die shops in this area are operating at only around 50% or less of their capacity and this almost altogether on normal jobs . They have received little or no national defense business . ? Anticipating that this would be the case , farsighted car and truck companies last fall stepped up their new model planning in the hope that they could get their 1942 programs at least partially completed before the defense program could use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
