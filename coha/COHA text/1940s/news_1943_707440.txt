txt BILLIONS ' WASTED ' IN LATIN AMERICA , SENATOR DECLARES Butler Asserts ' Good Neighbor ' Policy as Used There Breeds Hate and Contempt for Us WALLACE ATTACKS ' SLUR ' Nelson Rockefeller Says Total Committed Is $600,000,000 , Tithe of Figure Charged . By KATHLEEN special to THS NEW YORK TIKES . WASHINGTON , Nov. 26 ? Senator Hugh A. Butler , Republican , of Nebraska , in a 176-page report to the Senate of a trip he made last summer through twenty LatinAmerican countries , charged today that the United States Government was lavishing $6,000,000,000 there on wasteful and unnecessary projects which were breeding hate , suspicion and contempt for this country . The enterprises have for the most part little to do with the war program and are setting nation against nation in the southern part of the hemisphere , he asserted . Vice President Wallace thereafter issued a statement deploring " the shocking slur " on the LatinAmerican countries and predicted that the good neighbor policy , which the Nebraskan attacked as a ruse , would endure as the policy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat , of Tennessee , as acting chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee , took immediate issue with Senator Butler as to his authority in making such a report . The Tennessean declared that any such document should have been considered a private matter since Senator Butler traveled as a private citizen , paying his own expenses , and he objected to its publication as a Senate document . The objection was overruled . Links With " Local Dictators " An outstanding conclusion reached by Senator Butler in his exhaustive report was that the United States Government " exercises control together with the local dictators " in some of these controls . He quoted representatives of United States Embassies as either criticizing or confirming the waste= ful character of many of the enterprises financed , and reported that military officials were conceding the lack of military value of others scheduled especially for such purposes . One of these was the Pan-American Highway in the Canal Zone , about which the Senator cited " military leaders of the Caribbean Defense Council " as stating that " there was little if any justification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if it were finished , trucks , oil , gas and tires were so short that efficient use of it could not be made . " " This view was strenuously opposed by the American Embassy group , " he added . " They contend the highway is the one main link of future economic importance between the other neighboring nations and Panama . Especially , it will permit importation of food from Costa Rica for the Panamanian population . " Vast United States loans , credits and purchases of strategic supplies , Senator Butler asserted in his report , had been arranged frequently at the cost of suspicion and ridicule from creditor nations , who failed to show appreciation for such transactions in reciprocal activities . He charged , specifically , that // BILLIONS ' WASTED , ' SENATOR DECLARES // Mexico " extorts an unjustifiable tribute from the United States in the form of heavy import taxes on aviation gasoline , " adding that resentment by our United States military and civil agency members " hinges on the unfair toll placed on our attempt to help protect Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using our airplanes to patrol and protect the coasts and country , Mexico forces us to pay heavy import taxes on the aviation gasoline necessary to operate such planes , " the Senator added . In Brazil , he charged , lack of a reciprocal spirit was evident in Rio de Janeiro about a month ago when our " good neighbor " forced the United States to relinquish control towers at the airports to their military , who , he said , were not adequately trained technically in their operation . Against strenuous objections that lives of travelers in transport planes would be jeopardized , the Brazilian authorities , he recited , took them over anyway , and a short time later a big plane crashed at Rio , killing eighteen persons . " The point was proved , but the Brazilians still would n't budge , " the report commented . In Bolivia , said Senator Butler , the United States Defense Supplies Corporation , a subsidiary of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation , lent the republic $600,000 with which to buy new planes . This was to get Bolivia to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airways ) , an American air line , he said . " So here we have a come-on ' from our purse of $600,000 , " said Mr. Butler , " to get a foreign nation to subsidize an American air line . Well ! Well ! " Record of Loans to Peru Peru has defaulted on $81,600 , - 000 in bonds , but in spite of this the United States Export-Import Bank extended credit to that nation of $30,000,000 , Senator Butler continued . An indication that Peru did not intend to repay the loans , he asserted , was the attempt of the government recently , when the American Ambassador tried to elicit a " token payment " of 3 per cent of the interest due , to make a 2 per cent payment if the United States would guarantee continuance of lend-lease in undiminished volume . In Argentina , Senator Butler discovered , he reported , that a United States loan " to the Axiscollaborating dictator government of $50,000,000 enabled them to take over all their own oil exploration , according to an official of the Standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent some $30,000,000 for this purpose and which by this Federal action was forced out of the picture . " Paraguay is impoverished and yet the people are preparing for war with Argentina , he reported . " Some United States military staff members remarked that although we , the United States , are supposed to be fighting a war for peace , we furnish arms to the people of these countries to use against each other , " the Senator added . " At the same time we are robbing ourselves of needed war materials . " Spending , lending and subsidizing in Latin America , Mr. Butler stated , was creating problems which we might not be able to solve " in a score of years , " since Federal money " is creating fiery jealousies between peoples of Latin-American countries . " Statement by Vice President Henry T. Wallace 's statement read as follows : " As Vice President of the United States , I feel compelled to express my deep regret to our Latin-American Allies in the war for the shocking slur which has been made against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to say it is my belief that the people of the United States are profoundly grateful to you for the sincere , unselfish support which you have given us in our hour of need . " To those New World nations which have joined the war at our side and which have severed diplomatic relations with the Axis , I want to say that the policy of the Good Neighbor is the policy of the people of the United States and I am confident it will continue , and not be temporary . The fantastic figures Which have been used in an apparent effort to discredit the Good Neighbor policy will be refuted by the agencies involved . " Addressing the American Legion tonight at a dinner at the Mayflower Rotel , Nelson Rockefeller , Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs , denied the estimate of $6,000,000,000 for this country 's transactions in South America . He added : " That figure was said to represent a three-year outlay , not including , mind you , the sums spent for goods , food and raw materials . That guess of $6,000,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that all expenditures and commitments to spend made during the past three years by all Government agencies , including military and naval installations , total less than $600,000,000 . " And after these three war years , United States Government loans to the other Americas , including lend-lease materials and Export-Import Bank loans , total $603,000,000 , of which less than half has actually been disbursed . " It is interesting to note in this connection that up to date , other American republics have paid back to the Export-Import Bank loans totaling $107,000,000.
