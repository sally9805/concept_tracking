txt ? The Balkan Peninsula was teeming with rumors and alarms tonight as Britain broke off her tenuous diplomatic relations with occupied Rumania , as fifth-column and semimilitary German units began to filter .. into Bulgaria in quantity and as various indications were received of Italian preparations to get a large-scale drive under way in Albania . CBulgaria has been informed by Russia not to expect the Red Army to march if Germany should send troops across her territory , reliable diplomatic quarters in Sofia said , according to The Associated Press . At the same time it was learned from authoritative sources that the German Legation in Athens had warned Greece that the landing of British forces in Salonika might be regarded as menacing by the Reich . It is apparent that a first-class crisis is in the offing . When it will come to a climax , if it does , can not be predicted and there are many unpredictable factors involved . But there was considerable fear in all southwestern capitals all day that a large-scale extension of the war in this area might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to strike back at any German push to the south by allowing the Royal Air Force a free hand to bomb the Rumanian oil fields , pipe-lines and ports , thus damaging the Reich 's ; chief source of supply . Preparations for such a move have been under way for three months . The petroleum districts were within range of bombers based in Greece . Considerable mapping and staff work have been done . However , as long as diplomatic re ; lations between Bucharest and London continued on a correct basis it // EXTENSION OF WAR FEARED IN BALKANS // was accepted that there would be no attack . More than two weeks ago the British Minister to Bulgaria , George Bendel , warned Ivan Popoff , the Bulgarian Foreign Minister , that Bulgarian passive resistance to a German army of occupation would be regarded by London as sufficient excuse to allow the bombing of railways , roads , bridges , airfields and other strategic objectives . Although reports that a note to this effect was delivered today are untrue , the speech by Prime Minister Churchill was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displeasure by the government and when rebroadcast by the Sofia radio it was drastically cut . Bulgaria is also reported to have received a warning from Colonel William J. Donovan , President Roosevelt 's personal envoy , who emphasized that the United States was backing Britain to the limit . He is said to have pointed out that no mercy could be expected for Bulgarian claims if she did not remain out of the war . But it would seem that the situation has already gone too far . A highly placed diplomat in Sofia said tonight , in reference to the Germans : " I do n't know when they are coming , but they are coming very soon . " Germans in civilian clothes have been pouring in during the past few weeks and one Sofia diplomat estimated their number in the thousands . The latest groups have passports dated Feb. 6 and marked , under reason for travel , " professional purpose . " Germans Sunervise Airnerts Germans are rapidly taking over supervision of airports , although there is not yet any confirmation that they have assumed control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German anti-aircraft guns have been recently set up and that German Army trucks have entered the country . The north and south road System is being rapidly improved and bridges are being strengthened , according to reliable sources here . Schools in certain districts are being suspended . The army  --  which at present numbers only about fifteen divisions  --  is being concentrated in the south and southeast . Airports are being improved and German technicians are in evidence . The Danube River today was free of ice at Guirgui and can be traversed on pontoon bridges . The Germans have dozens of these ready in Rumania . Nevertheless , floating chunks of ice are still going downstream in Yugoslav territory and such a manoeuvre would still be risky . The Bulgarian situation is accompanied by the usual maze of Balkan rumors . There were persistent but unconfirmed reports that Arkady Soboleff , special Soviet envoy to Bulgaria , had returned suddenly by air to Sofia , presumably to confer on the German threat . There is not yet any indication why Ivan Bagrianoff , the former pro-German Minister of Agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will return . Although the Greeks are continuing to fight hard and with some success in Albania , it is learned that oral German warnings were transmitted to the Athens Foreign Office a short time ago , cautioning the Greeks against permitting too much British armed aid . It was particularly emphasized that no British forces would be tolerated in Salon- I fka , from which the Vardar River campign started in the last war , thrusting into the heart of the Central Powers . From Susak on the Yugoslav-Italian frontier there were reports that Italy was massing troops in the North Adriatic ports , presumbaly to build up the already extensive army in Albania . It is said  --  although without direct confirmation  --  that the warehouses in Fiume are being used as barracks and that troops are beng constantly unloaded from the railroad station at the free port to be transported in convoys at night . The Italians are already reported to have 300,000 soldiers in Albania and a large reserve force ready to try to break the Greek line in the northern sector . This assembly of facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely believed by diplomats that the Germans would like to occupy Bulgaria , thus cutting off Yugoslavia from practically all hope of aid in case of attack , menacing Turkey and Greece . According to the best information here  --  and it must be emphasized that all this is guesswork  --  the Germans hope to accomplish the entry into Bulgaria without meeting resistance from the Turks and the prospect of active resistance from the Bulgarians or the Yugoslays is less than remote . A ranking neutral diplomat in Ankara told the writer he was certain the Turks would stand by their intentions to attack Bulgaria from the south if the Germans entered . However , there is still considerable suspicion here as to their future actions . The Germans are said to have something more than 300,000 soldiers in Rumania and equipment for many more . A diplomat here today said he had information that nine new divisions of the Wehrmacht would soon move into Rumania and that a force of thirtyfour divisions was concentrated there . I The Yugoslays have 500,000 men under arms . The Bulgars have 200,000 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500,000 men in European Turkey . If the Germans are confident they can enter Bulgaria without Turkey 's opposition their present army is large enough for the task , even allowing for the disposition of large numbers of troops on the Rumanian-Russian frontier for protective purposes . I If , however , the Turks adhere to their previous intentions of attacking Bulgaria in such an instance , it is doubtful that the Bulgarian Army would be large enough to hold them back and there is always a possibility , if not a likelihood , that the nervous and pro-British Yugoslays might join in . The weather is another important factor and all the main : river systems are flooded at present , with slush and mud predominating in the lowlands and heavy snows in the heights . For these reasons it is still the prevailing opinion of most diplomats that unless the Germans have assurances from the Turks that they will not fight unless directly attacked , the Wehrmacht will hold back for at least a short time . But there is more nervousness in evidence than at any time since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
