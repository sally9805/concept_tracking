Is King Cotton tottering on his throne ? In the worried South , researchers preparing for the coming postwar battle with rayon and other synthetic upstarts have been hard at work experimenting with likelier strains , new methods of machine cultivation ( TIME , Nov. 13 ) . Last week they heard good news : a Georgia State Experiment Station has developed a " super cotton " which may give the king new life . The new strain , called " Empire " : <P> Matures so quickly that the boll weevil , a late spring starter , can do it little damage . It is also practically immune to the bud-eating thrip . <P> Has long fibers of great tensile strength , grows in big bolls that are easy to pick , bears relatively few leaves ( thick foliage shades cotton too much ) . <P> Yields about 25% more cotton lint per acre than the best previous strains .
