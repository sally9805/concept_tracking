The War Production Board offices , where gloom has often been thick enough to cut with a machine tool , were aglow last week with broad smiles , good digestions , men humming in the halls . <P> Seven months-and some new men-had made a startling difference . In May , WPB had been forced to cancel war contracts right &; left : the planning had got out of hand , the program was overexpanded , raw-material supply was in a black mess . WPB and the Army were in a knock-down fight for authority . <P> Last week WPB again began to cancel contracts-with a difference . This time WPB knew what it wanted and where it was going : the shifts were designed to balance the program , to smooth the flow of parts into finished armaments , to speed the offensive weapons the U.S. needs for the new kind of war it is fighting . <P> Vice Chairman Ferdinand M. Eberstadt , after three months on WPB , had his new " controlled materials plan , " for allocating the nation 's raw materials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a concrete program of Army , Navy , Lend-Lease and civilian needs for 1943 . Eberstadt also knew , better than ever before , how much material would be available . There was a good chance that supply and demand could be balanced . <P> Vice Chairman Charles Edward Wilson had emerged , through a " compromise " of the WPB-Army fight , as a bona fide production boss with the power to say yes and no . Under new authority he received last week he will survey Army &; Navy production schedules , balance them against industrial capacity and materials supplies , make sure that they can and do get completed . These powers suited able Charles Wilson to a T. <P> Significantly , the Army also had what it chiefly wanted : the right to decide what materiel it needs and to deal directly with its contractors . Before a Senate Committee last week Lieut . General Brehon B. Somervell , the Army 's aggressive Chief of the Services of Supply , was asked who had umpired the fight . " No one did , " he replied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it settled ? " I do n't know exactly , " said General Somervell . <P> If the compromise worked as well as Washington hoped last week , men might soon have trouble saying exactly what the fight was even about . In retrospect , it may turn out to have been a quarrel over semantics .
