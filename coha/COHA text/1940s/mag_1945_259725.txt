What Next , Corporal Hargrove ? <P> ( MGM ) is a Hollywood-manufactured sequel to See Here , Private Hargrove , but it happens to be funnier than the original . The war , as it was fought by eager , incompetent Corporal Hargrove ( Robert Walker ) and cynical con-man Private Mulvehill ( Keenan Wynn ) , bears only a casual scenic resemblance to real war . The France they trudge through is a mythical landscape . But Hargrove and Mulvehill seem far more real than many of the screen 's dead-earnest soldier heroes . <P> As the picture opens , Corporal Hargrove and his muddy unit are trying to push a truck out of a ditch in France ; when it ends they are deep in the same trouble . In the interim Hargrove has overwhelmed a French town by mere awkward charm , been energetically pursued by the mayor 's vivacious daughter ( Jean Porter ) , taken a number of Nazis prisoner and been elaborately swindled , along with Private Mulvehill . <P> The rapid series of funny episodes which make up Hargrove 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things moving-and just enough plausibility to keep them from getting out of hand . Hargrove 's experiences ( which are not actually Writer Marion Hargrove 's but the inventions of Scripter Harry Kurnitz ) have the flavor of a letter home to an aunt who is a good old sport . <P> The Seventh Veil ( Sydney Box-Universal ) is an English picture which sets out to resolve the romantic dilemmas of a lady concert pianist . It uses the relatively new medical technique of narcohypnosis as an excuse to use the old movie technique of the flashback . What is known in the trade as a " woman 's picture , " The Veil examines the frustrations of a basically good girl who is besieged by three far-from-perfect suitors . U.S. audiences may note that the psychiatric theme used in Hollywood 's recent Spellbound has been more intelligently filmed by the British . <P> At first , Francesca ( Ann Todd ) , a beautiful pianist whose fairly simple liking of men and pianos has led her into a complex state of emotional bewilderment , wo n't tell her doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few bars of musical therapy to snatch the last veil of reserve from her tortured mind . As soon as the doctor 's shot in the arm and soft talk begin to take effect , Francesca begins to remember a happy childhood followed by years of frustration . Her schoolmistress beats her across the knuckles ; her bad-tempered but handsome guardian ( James Mason ) loves music but hates women ; her first suitor , an American saxophone player , proposes marriage but lets her get away ; a pudgy , pompous portrait painter merely proposes that she run off with him to a tumbledown villa in Italy . <P> The Seventh Veil is handsomely photographed , elegantly produced and acted with full romantic flourishes . It is a typical exhibit in Britain 's current campaign to beat Hollywood at its own game ( see above ) . The music includes the Grieg Concerto in A Minor , the Mozart Sonata in C Major and something called the Seventh Veil Waltz . Ghost Pianist Eileen Joyce and the London Symphony Orchestra perform superbly . But British moviemakers have learned more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much surprised to see at the end that Francesca 's heart has really been yearning for True Love .
