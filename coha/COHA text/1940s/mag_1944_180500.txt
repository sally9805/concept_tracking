Why <P> As the Russian delegates moved out of Dumbarton Oaks last week , and the Chinese delegates moved in , a crucial fact was highlighted again : no factor is more important to the world 's future peace and security than the mind and the mood of Russia . Few could doubt that Russia passionately desires postwar peace and security . And that desire is no mere emotional urge . After World War II , none of the Allies except the U.S. would be capable of sustaining a major war for at least a generation . Russia must have peace and security . <P> And yet Russia , at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference , had insisted that , in the proposed security league , any one of the Big Four ( the U.S. , Britain , Russia , China ) must have the right to veto any attempt by the league to discipline an aggressor-even if the vetoing power was itself the aggressor . Clearly , Russia 's mind was wary , her mood was suspicious . Why ? <P> Ticklish Topic . The N.Y . Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels , he pointed out , is that Estonia , * Latvia , Lithuania and Poland east of the Curzon Line are her legitimate business , . not to be meddled with by outsiders . She fears that at some future time the Baltic States or Poland might appeal to the security league , charge Russia with aggression against them . The U.S. and Britain might be inclined to listen . <P> Russia does not consider her occupation of those lands to be aggression . She considers them rightfully hers in the first place , and vital to her security . Joseph Stalin has tenaciously held to this position in his talks with President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill . <P> Plainly , Russia 's hesitations , her wary mind and mood of suspicion were the realistic Russians ' way of saying to their Allies : Face the facts . Stop talking about the Baltic States and the Polish question . If you want world security , you can have it , but you must first recognize our right to national security . <P> Timesman Reston put the Russian attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not ask her to give up the Baltic States any more than she should ask us to give Texas land back to Mexico .
