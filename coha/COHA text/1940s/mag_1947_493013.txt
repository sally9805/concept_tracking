THE WEEK tHE HAZARDS INVOLVED in getting funny with a funny man were illustrated in San Francisco a few days tio when Ring Lardner Jr . visited the city after having been " sprung , " as be said , from federal custody in Los Angeles . Lardner appeared before an audience of 2,000 and gave them the " confession " J. Parnell Thomas Wanted to hear from him . He had been seduced into the move-bent , Lardner said , by a ravishing tinwhose party name , she revealed Bert morning , was " The Torch . " His subversion proceeded apace , getting him in deeper and deeper until be found himself in a school so far underground that graduates received their diplomas in decompression chambers . But disillusion set in . " One night , " said Lardner , " I dreamed of resigning . " ' The dream was recorded on a secret device and automatically radioed to Moscow , where it was analyzed by ahuddle of Soviet psychiatrists . When be woke in the morning , there was a full interpretation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside it . INFLATION FIGHT aodteyisag . For three weeks after the President outlined to Congress his 10-point program for inflation control , the Republicans taunted the Administration with being vague . Meanwhile , they were just as vague themselves . In the middle of last week the shadowboxing stopped and real blows came thick and fast . First , Secretary of Commerce W. Averell Harriman appeared before a Senate judiciary subcommittee with a bill which covered four of President Truman 's 10 points . It asked for presidential authority to apply priorities to scarce goods , to allocate them to essential users ( including power to impose consumer rationing ) , to control inventories and to extend export controls . The subcommittee 's chairman , Senator John S. Cooper ( R , Ky. ) , said he was " overwhelmed . " The only GOP " out " was to throw the whole thing back into the President 's lap and hope that the continued inflation could somehow be blamed on White House inaction . Two days later , the GOP did just this . Representative Jesse P. Wolcott ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Currency Committee , introduced into the House a bill authorizing the President to " consult with representatives of industry , business and agriculture " about voluntary agreements within these groups to allocate transport facilities , market livestock at the most efficient grades , allocate and inventory-control scarce commodities and limit speculative trading . Price-fixing agreements were barred , but apart from that the anti-trust laws were to be suspended ? almost a replica of the NRA . President Truman replied that never , so long as he was President and could stop it , would the anti-trust laws be relaxed . Secretary of Labor Lewis Schwellenbach followed up by hitting the Republicans with a bill for presidential powers to roll back prices of critical items to a June 11-18 level . The GOP ignored this second blow and prepared to rush the Wolcott measure through under rules prohibiting amendments from the Boor and limiting debate to 20 minutes a side . THE INTERIM AID VOTE Debate . The six days of debate on the emergency-aid program revealed tensions and basic disagreements which will take on much larger proportions when the long-range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we talk too much and think too little , " Chaplain Peter Marshall prayed on the day before the final vote . Leaders as well as rabid individual members needed his prayers . Old-time isolationists like Representatives August Andresen ( R , Minn . ) , Harold Knutson ( R , Minn. ) and Howard Buffett ( R , Nebr. ) not unexpectedly challenged the whole principle of the bill . But in the votes on the 47 major amendments offered in the House , such Republican leaders as Charles Ha/leek ( Ind . ) , Clarence Brown ( Ohio ) and John Taber ( N. Y. ) were too often found in opposition to their party 's own proposals . Buffett claimed that Stalin was the real man behind the bill : " The Kremlin is thinking of every way possible how it can make America pour its resources across the ocean . " Representative Andresen summed up the most popular opposition viewpoint : " Our country is not strong enough nor do we have resources enough to go out over the world and underwrite the needs of every country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( D , 6 Ohio ) , like many others , was worried most for fear we would not be given credit for our philanthropy : " There might be some advantage in limiting the relief supply to alphabet vegetable soup and using only those sections of the alphabet ' USA ' , " he suggested . Representative John Davis Lodge ( R , Conn. ) warned that " if we fail to pass the bill Communists all over the world will be rejoicing . " But Knutson argued that " if money would stop communism , you would n't have any now in Hollywood . " The heart of the fight in the House was on an attempt to limit relief goods to those things not now in short supplyin the US . In other words , no grain , no fertilizer , no farm machinery , no petroleum products , no anything that is not running out of our ears . Here Farm Bureau-Southern Democrats took the lead . Representative Don Wheeler ( D , Ga. ) introduced the amendment which would have gutted the whole aid program . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his move " to protect the American people , " and Tom Abernathy ( D , Miss. ) added a companion amendment to make it even harder to send Europe any fertilizer . Opposition . Members on both sides of the aisle sprang up in opposition . NEW . REPUlltie Representative Everett Dirksen Ill. ) told the House : " What we are saying to the world is that we are willing to share so long as it requires no sacrifice cn our part . . . . The people of the United States are ahead of Congress on this program . . . they are far ahead of the petty argument that has been made on this floor . " Helen Gahagan Douglas ( D , Calif. ) went further : " If we adopt this amendment I really do not see much point in passing the bill . If we put into this bill that nothing in short supply will be purchased for Europe , every time the price of anything goes up in a store , they will say , - you see , *MASER 22 , 1947 if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be going up . ' Thus , you will begin a hopeless political battle . . . on the eve of an election which will be based not on facts but on misinformation . Prices are high because we scrapped price controls . " Representative Vito Marcantonio ( ALP , N. Y. ) was howled down on an attempt to substitute a UN-administered program of $1.5 billion aid . Chester Merrow ( R , N. H. ) sought to increase the authorization to $661 million with little better results . Toward the end , the Republicans dared a semi-official attack on the program they were supposedly sponsoring . Representative Lawrence Smith ( R , Wis. ) , egged on by majority-leader Halleck , offered a proposal to cut the amount to $500 million . There is no record on who did and who did not follow Smith and Halleck through the teller gate on this one -- or on any of the other 46 proposed amendments ? or even on the final vote on the bill . The Republican leadership preferred that all nose counting be without benefit of official record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble is already brewing for ERP . SIG JOHN 'S NEXT MOVE SAIL John L. Lewis once more pulled his United Mine Workers , 600,000 strong , into splendid isolation , with the curt , blue-crayoned note : " Green , AFL . We disaffiliate . Lewis . " From now on John L. will be fighting alone . There will be no " new alliance " with the CIO Left , which is too weak to pull any big unions out of the Murray line-up . Perhaps Bill Hutcheson and his AFL carpenters may follow the miners some day , but the chances are very faint . The simplest explanation of why Big John has decided to become a " loner " for keeps is that he lost his grandiloquent claim to " moral leadership " of the AFL when its October convention rejected his advice on non-Communist affidavits ( Lewis said not to sign ) . So the miners ' boss picked up the marbles and walked out . Although there is some speculation that Lewis might try to build his catch-all District 50 into competition against the AFL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effort . He is 67 years old and in poor health . FAILURE WITH CREDIT ? Checkup . When President Truman 's Committee on Civil Rights issued its report on discrimination , a group of Montclair , New Jersey , citizens did more than read a few paragraphs and then forget . Using the report as a yardstick of community health , they proceeded to put their town through a stiff physical examination to see how it measured up . Montclair ( population 40,000 ) did n't pass . Six research committees , sponsored by the Montclair Forum and the American Veterans ' Committee , arrived at basically the same conclusion : that the town 's 6,800 Negroes live as semi-citizens in a community which discriminates against them in housing , education , employment , recreation , public health and access to public facilities . Not all of the news was bad . Some 800 Montclair townsfolk , seated in a public-school auditorium , heard the investigators report that , despite its discriminatory customs , there is solid evidence that Montclair is making progress in the treatment of its Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The bad : On Montclair 's staff of 256 teachers , only one Negro holds a full-time position . The good : There is no segregation in the junior and senior high schools . 7 Q. Housing ? The bad : Of 170 realty deeds examined , 40 contained restrictive covenants barring Negroes , Jews and Italians . The good : The new veterans ' housing project accepts tenants solely on the basis of " need . " C. Employment ? The bad : Private concerns as a rule employ Negroes only as laborers . The good : New Jersey Bell Telephone , Prudential Insurance and Westinghouse do not discriminate ; nor do the town 's Department of Public Works and Bureaus of Public Health and Nursing . C. Recreation ? The bad : The YMCA is segregated . The good : Public Recreation Department activities are open to and used by persons of all races and creeds . C. Public Health ? The bad : Negro doctors are not allowed to practise in the hospitals . The good : The hospitals employ Negro nurses . ? Public Facilities ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mixed Negro and white investigating group with " evidences of displeasure . " One restaurant refused service entirely . The good : Three places served the group with courtesy . In general , the report made unhappy reading . But on one important score Montclair emerged with credit . It had courageously exposed its own faults in an honest effort to correct them .
