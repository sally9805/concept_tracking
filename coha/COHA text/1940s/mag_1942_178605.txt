Fleshy , flashy Ray Dumont , onetime Wichita sporting-goods dealer , is a prolific begetter of brain children . Six years ago , to stimulate his trade , he organized the country 's sandlotters into the National Semi-Pro Baseball Congress . To ballyhoo the sand-lot business , he introduced many innovations : automatic home-plate duster ( compressed air whooshed through an underground tube ) , neon-lighted Scoreboard , jack-in-the-box microphone for umpire 's announcements , electric eye to detect balls . <P> Last week Ray Dumont announced the birth of another brain child : an " eagle 's nest " for umpires . Like the crow 's nest tried out at a Southern Oregon State Normal basketball game last month , the ballpark nest will be about ten feet above the ground , will give the base umpire a bird's-eye view of the infield . But Dumont 's nest will be perched on a movable derrick , which , at the press of a button , will whisk the umpire to crucial spots . <P> First tryout : next summer , when the pick of President Dumont 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ championship .
