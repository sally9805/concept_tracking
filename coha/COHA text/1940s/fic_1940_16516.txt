She sits down on her suitcase , does n't look at him , does n't speak .

FRONT PORCH - DAWN Joe , going out the front door . Amy and Tony , crossing the porch after him . It 's still dark inside . 185 EXT . FRONT OF TONY 'S HOUSE - DAWN The very first grey light is seeping down into the valley . It 's still dark under the trees . The lower vineyards swim in pools of mist . Very soon it will be light enough for God to take a look at His world , and say to Himself : " What a fine day this is going to be . " Joe picks up his canvas bundle of belongings , and strides away along the short-cut through the vineyards towards the gate . Tony and Amy come out onto the steps , looking after him . A long pause . He puts his arm around her .  --  148  --  &nbsp; TONYJoe shake da han ' . ( he smiles to himself , then looks down at her ) What you think ' bout , Amy ? &nbsp; AMYWhat a nice day it 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FROM THE HIGHWAY - DAWN Joe , coming up out of the misty vineyards along the rise near the gate . He turns , waves . Tony and Amy , in the distance on the steps of the house , wave back . Joe moves on past the camera , off towards the road . Amy and Tony go back into the house . THE CAMERA PANS to the RIGHT , from the house to the long stretch of low , mist-wrapped vineyards that reach on and on to the high hills . The sun is just touching the top of the nearest hill . A bird , somewhere among the grapes , is just beginning to sing , and to wonder about the morning worm . FADE OUT - THE END - pp. 95-121 &nbsp;
