The U.S. gave the Philippines something more than political independence : an imitative regard for " the American way . " Filipinos take it to mean hustle and enterprise . Their islands are booming . War-battered Manila is largely restored , with gleaming new buildings sprouting up from rubble . Herds of shiny cars weave through the downtown traffic , spin along the wide boulevard around the bay . Filipinos have adopted some other symbols , too : jukeboxes blare U.S. tunes by day and neon signs glow in profusion at night . In the once-gutted Great Eastern Hotel , new robin's-egg-blue elevators shoot up to a cool , spacious ballroom . <P> The boom has a foundation . Through the islands , hemp and copra production is steeply up ; canefields converted to rice and cotton during the war have been turned back to-more profitable sugar ; refineries are going full blast ; inter-island shipments are heavier than prewar . <P> New President . The darkest blot on the Philippine idyl is the two-year-old insurrection of the Hukbalahaps* of central Luzon . Although they are led by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as the Chinese Communists once pretended to be ) basically discontented farmers . The main demand of the Huks is for abolition of the absentee landlord system ; or , failing that , for enforcement of an already existing rice tenancy law ( 70% for the tenant , 30% for the landlord ) . The late President Manuel Roxas refused their demands , unseated seven Congressmen sympathetic to the Huks . The Philippines ' fat , hard-driving new President Elpidio Quirino thought he would change all that . For two years no high government official had entered Huk territory without a formidable escort . Quirino made a quick but thorough tour of the disturbed areas , without fanfare and with no other vehicle than his own sleek Packard . In broiling La Paz , he spotted a stooped little man whom he himself , when Secretary of the Interior , had discharged as mayor ( for insubordination ) twelve years before . From the man 's cartridge belt dangled a huge pistol . <P> " Why are you carrying a pistol ? " asked the President . <P> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did n't I once suspend you for failing to follow government orders ? " <P> The man hung his head , nodded . <P> " Who is the mayor here now ? " <P> " My nephew . " <P> " Tell your nephew not to allow politics to interfere with his duty to the people , so I wo n't have to suspend him too . " <P> New Leaf . After surveying the disaffection and devastation in the central Luzon provinces , President Quirino was back in Manila last week . Said he : " I made the trip to learn exactly what the people expect from the government and what they have against it . . . I think they are ready for the government and officials to turn over a new leaf . " Quirino ordered the constabulary to withdraw its patrols , not fight unless attacked . To Luis Taruc , the Huk commander , he sent word that he was ready to offer a general amnesty if the Huks would turn in their guns . But lean Communist Luis Taruc was not planning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent word back this week that he was ready for " revolution , if this is the only remaining alternative . " <P> <P> *From Hukbo ng bayan laban sa hapon , meaning People 's Army against Japan .
