In the presence of the elegantly uniformed diplomatic corps and ecclesiastics , headed by crimson-calotted Santiago Luis Cardinal Copello , the 6th Ordinary Session of the Congress of the Argentine Republic was formally opened one afternoon last week by **35;14786;TOOLONG - Exercise- of - the - Executive - Power Dr. Ramon S. ( for nothing ) Castillo . Fireworks had been predicted . Cucumber-cool Castillo popped not a single lady-cracker . <P> To listless , chatting Congressmen , the juridical-minded Acting President slowly , laboriously read his message . He stressed hemispheric solidarity , the blessings of peace-and Argentina 's determination not to change its policy a tittle . Excerpts : <P> &gt; " Our solidarity with the U.S. is founded on historico-geographical bases . ... It led us to issue the decree of Dec. 10 , 1941 , declaring that nation nonbelligerent . . . . <P> &gt; " Amid a worldwide catastrophe that affects us all , we at least preserved the right to live in peace with nations , the supreme aspiration of all young countries , with no hates or bitterness or desires of conquests other than those achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deputies , however , fireworks were certain . The opposition plans an all-out fight against Argentina 's detested state of siege ( which Castillo announced would continue ) , plans to demand clarification of the country 's foreign policy. * The opposition also proposed to contest Castillo 's proposal to revise the already fraud-mocked Saenz Pena Electoral Law . The total was a fine pyrotechnic program . <P> Of whatever nature the fireworks displays , the Argentine people were not to be permitted either to ooh or to boo them . The police forbade newspapers not only to print or comment on Congress speeches on international questions or the state of siege , but even to print the fact that comment had been forbidden . <P> His speech delivered , Castillo returned to the Casa Rosada . Past faintly , politely clapping crowds , rolled the procession : a smart motorcycle escort , a vanguard of brass-helmeted , crimson horsetail-plumed Grenadiers of San Martin astride magnificent horses , Acting President Castillo in an elegant victoria , a rear-guard of more magnificently mounted Grenadiers . Trailing behind the cavalcade silently rolled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Independence Day , President Roosevelt wrote at length to ailing , inactive President Roberto Marcelino Ortiz , more briefly to Acting President Castillo . Fhrer Adolf Hitler felicitated Castillo , snubbed Ortiz.
