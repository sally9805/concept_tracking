The great military volcano of the Mediterranean got ready to erupt . From Port Said to Gibraltar , steam burst from a hundred vents , and the pent-up force of military , naval and air might rumbled like subterranean lava flows . <P> This time the heat of the explosion would be felt around the world . This time both sides were determined that the fight would end in no stalemate . The stake of the battle would be the continent of Africa , and not only Africa but the United Nations ' supply lines to the Near and Far East . A defeat in the Mediterranean could well turn out as disastrous as the loss of China or India , or a rout on the Russian front . <P> In the eastern Mediterranean , the German eyed Cyprus , hoped to make it another Crete , a steppingstone down the Levant to Suez . To the north in Bulgaria , General Wilhelm Student , No. 1 Nazi parachutist , whipped new men into shape , ran a vast training program for glider pilots , reconditioned ground officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an invasion of Britain , but a better bet was that they were headed for the Mediterranean . <P> On Malta , German airmen operating from Italy stepped up their raids until they were almost continuous . The banging they gave the stout little island could no longer be explained as a show to establish a point of pride . The Axis was pocketing too many losses for that-in April a total of 137 aircraft , by British count . Malta went on taking it and fighting back , proudly showed a statue of Victoria , respectable , white and undamaged in the ragged mess of Valetta 's disheveled ruins . <P> Already Germany had destroyed Malta 's value as a main operating base for the British Fleet . It had worn down the island to the point where , by British accounts , bomber raids from Malta into Italy had come to an end . All that was left was the island , and the Axis wanted that , too . <P> Meanwhile from southern Italian ports the Axis sent convoys heavily reinforcing Field Marshal Rommel 's Panzers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite the desert 's dust and heat , Rommel would strike soon from his bases where the great headland swings out to the sea on the Gulf of Sidra . The suggestion was not lost on the British . Their pilots bombed the German base at Bengasi daily ; ranging through the desert storms over the German positions , they fought daily dogfights over waterless wastes . <P> Farther west , where the bewildered Vichyfrench still clung to the ghostly pretense of control , the ground rumbled too . Two British planes swept over Algeria , were shot down by French craft . ( Two more fell before French attack down the west African coast below Dakar . ) Through that defeat-darkened land German technicians , military men and tourists prowled . <P> In the Mediterranean itself the British Mediterranean Fleet , headed by its new commander Rear Admiral Sir Henry Harwood , dashing , eupeptic hero of the Graf Spec fight , maintained its equivocal control-unable to venture too far for fear of Axis air attack but still superior to any opposition the Italian Navy offered . Some day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst and the molten lava begin to flow .
