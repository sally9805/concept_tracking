txt Bernard M , Baruch 's " fourteen points " for providing international control of atomic energy are now beginning to receive the close and careful study which must inevitably precede the establishment of any plan of such magnitude . The extent . of this study was indicated by a spokesman for the British delegation who , while welcoming the American plan . declared that " huge problems " remain to be worked out . Furthermore , it seems highly probable that both the British and Australians ? as well as other delegations  --  will offer proposals of their own . In the case of the British , however , these proposals may come in the form of amendments rather than as a separate program . The Australians are also expected to be extremely active in the formulation of any suprananational atomic control plan , particularly if the Australian Minister for External Affairs , Dr. Herbert Evatt , remains in this country for a while longer . The first reactions to the Baruch proposal , which he offered direct from the White House and State Department , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not all , of the main aims expressed by Mr. Baruch , while the Australians are known to be highly pleased . It is felt that most of the other members of the 12-nation Atomic Energy Commission will react in the same way . As was expected , the main enigma is the attitude of the So- viet Union . American officials admit that they have not had a single prior indication from the Russians how they will react to the specific Baruch plan . This has not , however , caused any dis couragement since such secrecy and mystery are always expected of the Russians and since no one has forgotten that the Atomic Energy Commission was established as the result of the three-power Moscow conference on Dec. 27 , 1945 . Thus , at the present moment the Russians are as fully committed to the establishment of a workable atomic control program as is any nation other than the United States . Perhaps the question being ' mist widely asked is w. hat will be done with the atomic bombs now in the possession of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this question this early in the game , responsible American sources do suggest two possible courses of procedure : ( 1 ) The bombs might be destroyed or ( 2 ) they might be turned over to vhatever agency is chosen as the law-enforcing arm of the proposed atomic development authority . Powers of Enforcement A second question deals with the powers and the make-up of this law-enforcement body ? a body which Mr. Baruch feels must exist if any atomic plan is to be workable . In official American opinion , there are two possible answers to this question . The first is to place the responsibility for the enforcement of any atomic treaty with the Security Council if that body is willing to waive the Big Five veto-power in so fat as it touches the atom . The second 1 , to have this power resident in the ADA itself , in IA which rase it v.ohld be , again so far as the atom is con-corned. more pov. er 1 than the Security Council While playing down thi : aspect of their work at the present time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission are known to feel most strongly that they must also concern themselves eventually with the problem of bacteriological , biological , and as warfare . Main Reliance on Press This responsibility was given to them at the same time they were handed the problem of the atom and , as one of them said , it is quite possible that some day these modes of warfare may well constitute as fully ac great a threat as does atomic warfare . As of this moment , however , Mr. Baruch and his four associates will concentrate upon the atom , since this is the most publicized of the new methods of war , It is known that the Americans believe that the chances for success of their atomic elan will he determined to a considerable extent by the manner which it is handled by the newspapers m this country .
