In its 90 years , Street &; Smith has conceived and killed a fabulous brood of magazines . Last week this hoary outfit , king of the Deadeye Dick market in the gaslit days , unwrapped its first package designed for the neon-lit postwar world . <P> Out to newsstands went the September issue of Pic , completely redesigned . Readers of the previous dime , 50-page Pic , which was full of sleazy cheesecake , will hardly recognize the old girl in her new hairdo . The magazine has a new editor-tall , boyish Victor H. Wagner-and he has an assignment to make Pic straighten up and fly right after eight years of floundering . <P> Readers Wanted . The new Pic is a slicker two-bit , Esquire-like 120-page monthly aimed directly at the homebound G.I. Its thesis is that soldiers who yearned over pin-up girls in foxholes and wolf-howled in Paris will come home more sober and serious . To win them , Pic plans career pieces ( " How G.I.s Can Become Farmers " ) , designs for living ( " First Civvies in Five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dangerous " ) . <P> Pic 's elaborate face-lifting is typical of the way oldtime Street &; Smith keeps itself young . In fact , the old Street &; Smith has been hardly recognizable since 1938 , when white-haired , supercharged Allen L. Grammer moved in as president . He had spent more than 20 years as a kind of efficiency expert for Curtis Publishing Co. , and made a small fortune inventing new printing processes . He found Street &; Smith possessors of a building full of dusty rolltop desks , and coasting on its dusty laurels . He moved the offices into a skyscraper , and fixed up the foyer like a cocktail lounge . Then he went to work dusting off the laurels . <P> Penny Dreadfuls . S. &; S. goes back to 1855 when Printer Francis Shubael Smith and Bookkeeper Francis S. Street took over a broken-down fiction magazine . They added a few magazines of their own , and reached a pulp peak during the long presidency of Smith 's son , Ormond , who loved fine wines and rare first editions . Ormond Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost a nickel ) . <P> For Street &; Smith , Nick Carter ( in real life , Colonel Frederick Van Rensselaer Dey ) pounded out a novel ( 30,000 words ) a week . Burt L. Standish ( William Gilbert Patten ) manufactured 30,000 words a month about Frank Merriwell . Other S. &; S. standards : Oliver Optic ( William T. Adams ) , Horatio Alger Jr . <P> If a theme proved popular , Street &; Smith rode it to death . There were 400 volumes about Buffalo Bill , 1,000 about Frank Merriwell . Grammer wishes he knew how many different books and magazines S. &; S. has put out . Some old hands estimate it as over 10,000 titles . <P> Along with the pulp books , Street &; Smith built pulp magazines ( Ainslee 's , Top Notch , etc. ) , which kept going when the penny-dreadful fad passed . Some , like Western Story , still have a cozy 400,000 circulation . They have followed every change in public taste from the Western plains to the sea , to the air , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crest , when it sold 95 million magazines and pulps a year , S. &; S. had a stable of such writers as Upton Sinclair ( who wrote under the name of Ensign Clark Fitch , U.S.N. ) , Theodore Dreiser , Edith Wharton and 0 . Henry . <P> Up from Pulp . Just like the dime novel , the pulp magazines had their day .
