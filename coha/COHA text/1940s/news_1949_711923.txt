txt Axis Sally ' Is Found Guilty ; Sentence onT reason Delayed Jury , Deliberating More Than 17 Hours , Convicts Her for Participating in Nazi Broadcast to Discourage 1944 Invasion By The Associated i-rese . WASHINGTON , March 10 ? A Federal jury found Mildred E. ( Axis Sally ) Gillars guilty of treason today for broadcasting Nazi propaganda during World War U. The jury deliberated 17 hours and 20 minutes , with time out over- ' night for sleep , in reaching its verdict . Judge Edward M. Curran did not indicate when he would pronounce sentence . Under normal court procedure there is a delay of several days before sentence is passed . The maximum penalty would be death in the electric chair , with the minimum punishment five years in prison . ' The white-haired defendant , who ' was born in Maine , took the verdict with outward calm . Her face paled and her eyes blinked to fight back the tears , but she stood rigid and made no sound when the verdict was returned . Her half-sister , Mrs. Edward H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her side throughout the seven-week trial , broke down and wept . Later , pacing a small anteroom and taking fierce puffs on a cigarette , Miss Gillars told a reporter : " I wish those who judged me would be willing to risk their lives for America as I did . " That was an apparent reference to her argument , throughout the trial , that she always loved America , and that she actually helped the United States war effort by her radio broadcasts telling the families of captured American soldiers that they were still alive . The prosecution asserted that she.got " a sadistic joy " out of the broadcasts , notably those in which she described in harrowing detail the agonies of wounded American soldiers before they died . James J. Laughlin , defense lawyer , announced that he would seek a new trial on the ground that Judge Curran gave " inflammatory " instructions to the jury . Mr. Laughlin said that Judge Curran 's instructions showed that he " believed this woman to be guilty and wanted // her cnovicted . " Failing a mistrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case with an appeal to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals . The jury acquitted Miss Gillars on seven of the eight counts pressed by the Government in its original ten - count indictment . However , it found her guilty on count No. 10 involving a Nazi broadcast entitled " Vision of Invasion . " In that broadcast , beamed overseas to American homes and to United States troops then waiting to storm Hitler 's Europe , Miss Gil- , lars told of the alleged horrors that awaited any attempt to invade the continent . The broadcast was made in May , 1944 , a few weeks before the invasion of Normandy on Tune 6 . Miss Gillars played the role of an American mother who dreamed that her soldier-son , a member of the invasion forces , died in a burning ship in the attempt to cross the English Channel . The Government singled out this broadcast with heavy emphasis as an attempt to destroy the morale of American troops by building up a fear psychology of the dangers that awaited them . Actually , when American and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's vaunted " Atlantic wall , " a supposedly giant system of concrete fortifications , was largely a propaganda myth . A dead hush prevailed in the court room as the jury of seven men and five women filed in to announce their verdict shortly before 5 P. M. Asked what decision had I been reached , Foreman Henry G. , Davis Jr. , a telephone companyl worker , replied in a low voice : " Guilty . " The written verdict bore this notation : " We , the jury , find the defendant Mildred E. Gillars knowingly , willingly and with intent did violate her allegiance to the United States by participating in the radio recording covered by the overt act Number 10 . " Took Oath to Germany This recording , picked up by American Government monitors ' from the actual wartime broadcast , was played back several times during the trial , with judge , jury and other principals listening by ear- , phones . The " Vision of Invasion " drama contained many screams , groans and outcries as a background for the account of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man-conquered Europe . In her testimony , Miss Gillars acknowledged that she swore an oath of allegiance to Germany , but said that she did so under duress " in order to live " after Gestapo officials warned her that she was living " in danger . " Mr. Laughlin made an unsuccessful effort to turn this into a last-minute advantage for Miss Gillars , arguing that by swearing allegiance to Germany she had " expatriated " herself and thus was not legally subject to trial for treason against the United States . If she had been shaken during the tense minute of hearing her fate , Miss Gillars quickly regained her composure . As she walked from the court house through a blaze of camera flash bulbs to a patrol wagon , one of her escorting marshals remarked : " It looks like you are going to have your picture taken again , Sally . " " I should n't be surprised , " Miss Gillars replied , and thrust her chin up defiantly as she- made for the open doors of the wagon .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
