Last week , the 23rd of World War II and the eleventh of its elaboration in Finland , a gigantic slushy stalemate persisted on the Western Front ; a third contingent of Canadian troops arrived in England and the first Australian and New Zealand divisions landed at Suez ; desultory sea sniping was continued by Germany on Allied and neutral shipping ( see col. 3 ) ; and in Paris , the Allied Supreme War Council held its fifth full-dress meeting . <P> France 's Premier Daladier , who hobbled in on canes* to apologize for having to shift this meeting from England ( the last was in France , at Amiens ) , later described the gathering as " formidable " ( " tremendous " ) . Originally the Council consisted of four men : Britain 's Prime Minister Chamberlain and Lord Chatfield , France 's Daladier and Generalissimo Gamelin . This time Mr. Chamberlain took with him four members of his Cabinet-Lord Halifax ( Foreign Affairs ) , Winston Churchill ( Admiralty ) , Oliver Stanley ( War ) , Sir Kingsley Wood ( Air ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ironside , chief of the British Imperial General Staff , and Admiral of the Fleet Sir Dudley Pound . M. Daladier produced their French opposite numbers and the whole Allied hierarchy sat for three hours in the morning , 90 minutes in the evening , with long powwows over maps for the military specialists between times . " It was the finest meeting of the War Council I ever attended , " enthused M. Daladier . <P> Problems of supply-food and munitions-were announced as having been specially discussed by the conferees , but the vast horizon for military action which the Council now contemplates was revealed by comments from authoritative quarters after the conferees dispersed . This horizon now stretches all the way from the Arctic Ocean around through the Atlantic and Mediterranean to the Gulf of Persia . In Paris , wise talk was about swiftly increasing aid for Finland ( see p. 24 ) . In London it was reported that M. Daladier had proposed breaking off relations with Russia , but that Mr. Chamberlain restrained him , preferring to let Russia take that initiative . The Manchester Guardian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Finnish War " ( see p. 24 ) . <P> Putting an end to guessing , in which the Germans had gone too low , the Russians too high , Paris admitted that France has 275,000 men under arms in the Near East . London admitted that Great Britain has 500,000 men there-and then tried to suppress the figure . The Australians and New Zealanders landing at Suez were reported to number 30,000 , volunteers all . Further attention was drawn to this troop pool by the arrival in Cairo , Egypt of its commander , fox-smart little General Maxime Weygand , to join Lieut . General Sir Archibald Percival Wavell , Britain 's Near East commander , in reviewing an Anglo-Egyptian contingent , three-quarters British and largely mechanized , drawn up on the desert just outside Heliopolis . The line extended for a mile and a half , with vehicles standing three to six deep . The reviewing party was an hour and a half making its circuit . Next day General Weygand inspected the Suez Canal defenses.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
