In the marbled , high-walled hearing room of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee , the life- &-death; trial of the nation 's biggest lending agency dragged on into its fifth week . The question whether the powerful RFC should be continued beyond its legal deadline of June 30 has revolved chiefly around the way RFC had handled its biggest railroad deal , an $80 million loan to the Baltimore &; Ohio Railroad . The issue-and a first-rate ruckus-was raised by gaunt , balding Cassius Marcellus Clay , an ex-official of both RFC and the B. &; O. The loan , said he , was part of a " gigantic steal , " a " frame-up , " and " a fraud . " <P> Clay quit his $20,000-a-year job as general solicitor of the B. &; O. soon after it went into bankruptcy in 1945 for failing to meet the terms of the loan . He charged that the bankruptcy was a " conspiracy " promoted by onetime RFC Boss Jesse Jones to keep RFC control of the road , put more RFC men in top B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got some potent support from Railroader Robert R. Young , who popped up as a " surprise " witness . <P> " In my opinion , " said Gadfly Young ( who has no financial interest in the B. &; O. ) , " the handling of this situation by the B. &; O. management and the RFC was either dishonest or incompetent . " <P> Collateral Issue . At the time the B. &; O. declared itself bankrupt , said Young , it had $246 million in cash , bonds , and " quotable collateral " which it could have used to pay its RFC loans . The B. &; O. has argued that it needed its cash for working capital . Young said this was nonsense . His own rich Chesapeake &; Ohio Railway Co. , which did its biggest business ever in World War II , did it with a working capital of only a few million dollars . <P> Did Young think , asked a committee member , that RFC had gone astray in any other instance ? Cantankerous Bob Young could not have asked for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grossly mismanaged , " he cried . " They have been in bed with Wall Street . " Like a " Shylock " demanding its " pound of flesh , " RFC in cooperation with Wall Street had played " power politics " with the Erie Railroad , the Missouri Pacific , the Chicago &; North Western , " and half a dozen other bankrupt railroads . " By appointing former RFC employees as trustees of the bankrupt roads , RFC had in effect created an evil " voting trust . " As a result , Young declared , " those railroads have been grossly , almost criminally mismanaged . " <P> Was it really as bad as all that ? The committee , well aware of Young 's rabid animosity towards what he calls " goddamned bankers , " was impressed but far from convinced . Unless other RFC dealings , which it began to investigate this week , prove to be much worse , the committee will probably recommend that RFC be allowed to live , though with drastically reduced powers .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
