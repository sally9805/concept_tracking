According to James Montgomery Flagg , " doing an autobiography is something like getting undressed in your bedroom window . " In his caper-cutting autobiography , published last week , he appears in his bedroom window , and , in literary underwear striped with exclamation points , strikes many an exhibitionist pose . <P> " Though I am not conceited , " writes Flagg , " I am a vain creature . " Whatever he means by the distinction , he has some excuse for vanity . He sold his first drawing ( to St. Nicholas magazine ) when he was twelve , went on to earn as much as $75,000 a year from his illustrations and posters . His famed " I Want You " poster of Uncle Sam pointing a fiercely demanding finger took millions of civilian eyes in World War I. The sulky-looking , full-bosomed Ideal Woman that he created and developed was seen in all the slick magazines in the flat-chested twenties . Now 69 , he is still painting pictures that get about-such as his archly compassionate conception of Rosalind Russell in RKO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Flagg 's book is entitled Roses and Bucks'ot ( Putnam ; $3.75 ) . The roses are reserved for himself and a multitude of boon and swoon companions ; the buckshot flies in all directions . <P> His pet hate , modern art , gets both barrels : " You do n't need a guide to explain Sargent 's portrait of Marquand or Whistler 's Mother . . . . But what do you need beginning with Manet 's Olympia through Nude Descending the Staircase ... to the present-day Portrait of a Vacuum Cleaner having its Tonsils removed or Salad Bowl full of Left Ears ? I feel that you need the Yale Bowl to be sick in ! " <P> For his crony , Cartoonist Ham Fisher , Flagg has a thorned rose : " He is so keen , so well informed ; his wit is sharp and his imaginative humor is boundless-it is incredible that none of all this ever gets into his strip of ' comic stuff ' called Joe Palooka . " <P> Author Flagg 's roving eye also lights on the Barrymores , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawl out of a hollow tree-life would have been much duller without them . Jack and I had a lot in common ( possibly the less admirable traits ) . . . . We were both agreeably astonished that each of us was a friend and admirer of Jeddu Krishnamurti or Krishna . . . . " <P> Sunk to the Eyebrows . Indian mystic Krishna " had been touted ... as an ' untouchable , ' so much so that when I walked down Fifth Avenue with him he had to beg me to get him into a taxi since the females pestered him so . " Flagg 's own pestering gets considerably more space in his book . The story of his love life starts in low gear ( " How was I to know that beautiful Nellie , voluptuous and sweet to look upon , was physically frigid ? " ) , but soon shifts into high . <P> In recent years Flagg has feasted his eyes and practiced his art increasingly in Hollywood . Among his sitters : Greta Garbo ( " I was immediately sunk ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barber shop assistant . . . the two of us paid scant attention to anybody else from that moment until midnight " ) ; Hedy LaMarr ( " She would be the only living woman I would forgive for not having full breasts " ) ; and Joan Fontaine ( she " has'everything " ) .
