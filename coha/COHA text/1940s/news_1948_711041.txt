txt The House passed the Republican tax reduction bill today by a heavy coalition vote of 297 to 120 . The measure , center of what may prove to be the most significant political battle of this election year , was sent to the Senate under a tacit understanding that it would be revised there to soften the impact on Government revenues . As approved by the House , following rejection of a Democratic substitute , 258 to 159 , it would entail a 56,500,00 ) , 000 annual loss in Treasury receipts . Personal exemptions would be raised by $100 , income ? - splitting by married couples in all states would be permitted for tax return purposes , and all individual income levies would be cut 10 to 30 per cent . The general expectation of Senate revisions was credited for the heavy ballot in favor of the bill , since numerous Democrats and many Republicans were known to oppose so large a reduction at this time . 19 More Than ' Two-Thirds Sixty-three Democrats joined 234 Republicans to give the measure nineteen more votes than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is widely expected . Opposing the measure were 118 Democrats , one Republican and one American Laborite . The Republican opponent was Representative H. Carl Andersen of Minnesota , who took the same position last year on the two successfully vetoed tax reduction bills . Representative Merlin Hull of Wisconsin , the only other Republican who consistently voted against tax reduction last year , was recorded for the bill today . Of the sixty-three Democrats favoring the measure , all except eight were from Southern states or the border states of Maryland and West Virginia . In the test of the substitute measure , proposed by Minority Leader Sam Rayburn of Texas , 158 Democrats and one American Laborite voted for it , while twentytwo Democrats and 236 Republicans opposed it . All except two of the latter Democrats were from the South . The substitute was patterned on President Truman 's scheme for a $40-a-person reduction , offset by a 75 per cent excess profits tax on corporations . It called for an increase to $700 in the present personal exemptions of $500 , which would be substantially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed excess profits levy as well as the Republican bill 's income-splitting provikion . Senate to Delay Bill Chairman Eugene D. Millikin of Colorado said that the Senate Finance Committee probably would not take up the measure until the joint budget committee had recommended a budget-cutting target . He hailed the House action as " a. very fine vote . " which ' to my mind confirms the great public demand for tax reduction . " Mx . Millikin 's committee , according to the general expectation , will trim the amount of the cut by scaling down the percentage reductions or the exemption increase , p.ssibly both , or it will advance the effective date , now Jan. 1 , to July 1 . The House wound up more than two days of largely political debate on the issue with speeches by Mr. Rayburn and Speaker Joseph W. Martin Jr. , and the at , mosnhere was tense when the first vote was ordered . A few minutes later , however , the membership found itself in a good-humored uproar over a series of comic-opera events . Mr. Rayburn first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on Page 21 , Cohunnt2 GOP TAX CUT BILL PASSED BY HOUSE // but ' retracted it before the clerk began . He then changed his mind again , explaining that he had been confused , as " somebody had his I nose in my ear . " In putting the question , Speaker Martin , instead of using the customaryreference to " the gentleman from Texas , " inadvertently said " the gentleman from Rayburn . " When the laughter subsided , the speaker apologized , saying that he had " simply made a state out of the gentleman . " In his speech , Mr. Rayburn said that the Republican measure should be entitled " a bill to reduce taxes and borrow money , because that is what we would be compelled to do . " Its enactment would cause a budget deficit , he argued . Alluding to the prospects of Senate revisions , he said that it was " a cruel thing " for sponsors of the measure to ask House Republicans to mote for it in its present form . " They know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this will ever come out of Congress . " Mr. Martin replied that he wished to congratulate the minor-I ity leader , then added : " I think he has done a marvelous job with no case at all . " Mr. Martin ridiculed the Rayburn substitute proposal as the result of one hour 's study " in a little back room conference . " He said that the " definite program " ? of the Republican leadership was to reduce expenditures , maintain a balanced .. ; budget and continue annual reductions of the national debt . " These objectives can and will be achieved , " he asserted . " They should not be partisan , but should be supported by everyone who wants to restore security and sanity in our country . " Earlier Representative Robert L. Doughton of North Carolina , senior Democratic member of the Ways and Means Committee , told the House that he was regretfully " unable to give the bill my support , " though he favored tax reduction .

Overpayments made in January , February and March would be refunded next year . The measure , written by Representative Harold Knutson of Minnesota , Ways and Means chairman , would do the following things : Increase standard personal exemptions , now $500 for the taxpayer and each dependent , to $600 . This would primarily benefit lowincome groups , removing about 7 , - 400,000 of them from the tax rolls . Give persons over sixty-five years of age an extra $600 exemption and substitute another $600 for the present $500 deductions available to the blind . Extend to married couples in all states the privilege of dividing their combined income in making out their returns . Residents of twelve states having community , property laws can now do that and frequently take advantage of lower rates , since one big income is subject to higher rates than two smaller ones aggregating the same amount . Increase the maximum standard deduction for contributions , state taxes , etc. , to $1,000 from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to estate and gift taxes , resulting in a reduction of about 25 per cent in such levies . Give all individual income taxpayers additional cuts on the following scale  --  persons with net incomes of $1,000 or less , after exemptions and deductions , 30 per cent . Persons with net incomes between $1,000 and $1,395.83 , 30 to 20 per cent ( a flat $67 ) . Those with net incomes between $1,395.83 and $4,000 , 20 per cent . On incomes of $4,000 and over , 20 per cent for the first $4,000 and 10 per cent for the rest . Put a ceiling of 77 per cent of net income on any individual 's tax . The present maximum is 85.5 per cent . Meanwhile , the ninth conference of American Small Business Associations was assured by Senator Owen Brewster , Republican , of Maine , of a " tax cut of at least $4,000,000,000 within the next four months , the President 's veto notwithstanding .
