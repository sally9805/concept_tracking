The Italics are Mine A Story by A. L. Barker Illustrations by Marvin Sileek I REMEMBER the day when I first realized that my husband would like to kill me . There were crowds of people on the Common , wandering about because it was Sunday and they had nowhere to go . I could see them from our bedroom window , and down below I could see Ernest in the garden brushing his shoes . Ernest is my husband and I could tell just by looking at his back that lie knew I was watching him . Ernest is like a skinned rabbit , small like that , and colored . His chin is blue , his hair dark auburn and so thin that his scalp shines through , but his cheeks and arms and his neck are white . He wears yellow flannel shirts with gray stripes and separate stiff collars . Even in the hot weather he never goes out without his waistcoat ; on weekdays he has a nickel watch chain looped across , on Sundays a silver one . That 's the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was n't room in him for anything but rabbitry , for small tepid thoughts and fears . I thought so until I sawhim brushing his shoes that Sunday . He knew I was watching , he looked up and smiled at me . He had no reason to smile  --  except at what was in his mind  --  for my throat still ached with screaming at him . It was the same every Sunday , whenever he was at home all day . Toward the afternoon I could n't stand the sight of him any more and I lost my temper . He tried everything he knew to avoid that . He reasoned , he soothed , he begged , he kept silent , he got little presents and brought them to me , he told the doctor I was overwrought and had nerve tablets prescribed , he bought some special smelling-salts and I slapped them in his face and burnt him . It was no use , he always had to go out in the end ; wet or fine , he had to go and leave me alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset me , moving about the house like a little old maid , brushing up my cigarette-ash , washing the dishes with his sleeves folded back over his elbows . Perhaps you wonder why I married Ernest . I was young , I thought everyone would stop and look when I came . For twenty years I lived on my father 's farm at a little place called Mingle in the West Country . I was pretty , and perhaps there was n't anyone so green as I was . That was my father 's and brothers ' fault . My mother was dead ; there was just my father , my four brothers , and myself . When I was fourteen I left school and kept house for them ; I had to scrub and bake and churn . And they laughed me down , they were five big men with hands like timber and they preferred women to be green . They never told me anything , my ignorance was the family joke . Ernest travels for a firm that sells farm tools . " Agricultural implement makers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a new reaper and he kept coming back on some excuse or other , just to see me . My brothers laughed at him , they used to slap him on the back till he coughed , and when I gave him a plate of ( limier the same as they had , he pecked at it like a hen and my father finished it up in front of him . I remember thinking he was like that because he was a gentleman . His fingernails were oval and clean and he smelled of good shaving soap . He asked my permission when he first kissed me , and took me into the market town in his car and we had tea in a hotel lounge . I thought it was always going to be the same , and that he would be my purse . We were married , and I expected my fattier and brothers to be impressed , but they were n't . They laughed so much people thought they were mad . At first it was almost as fine as I 'd hoped . We spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bought clothes and made Ernest take me dancing . I flirted , and I learned to drink , and when Ernest would n't buy me drinks there were others who would . But when the honeymoon was over , we set up house and Ernest asked for a job in his firm 's office so that he would n't have to travel about and leave me alone . I did everything / could to get him to stay in his traveler 's job . He thought I was being unselfish , and in those days I did n't go so far as to say point blank that I did n't want him around . I do n't suppose I 'm the only one who 's been deceived like this ; everything happens over and over again . The difference is in me , in myself . It would be a pity for this to happen to anyone else ; that it should happen to IT1C is a tragedy  --  not just my tragedy . w HEN I was on my father 's farm , I felt thre were many lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelling and it was time , not incapacity , which kept me from living them all . I could feel my powers , they were so great and varied it was like patching a sack with satin to make me scrub and bake . And now I am no better off ; I am watered down , colorless  --  I am Ernest 's wife . He had put himself in all those glittering lives ; whichever one I choose , he is there first and it is no longer compelling , merely ridiculous . Then I feel I must scream , I must pour some strength , some violence over his weakness . It is his weakness which makes my skin crawl ; if I had done to my brothers any one of the things I have done to him , they would have thrashed and perhaps killed me . All he can do is to hold his silly little body quite stiff . And afterward he smiles and looks anxious and brings me things . He seems as if he can not hate . That was what I thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he could not hate , but he could . There was room in him for it , and for something else besides , as I discovered later . And these things which are the things men do , did not make him a man . Instead , he made them into something small and poor and all of a piece with himself . Yes , I thought , as I watched him at his shoes , he would like to kill me for what he is not  --  for being a woman to his rabbit . And I was not surprised . It was as if a voice had said , " You know he would like to kin you ? " and I had answered , " Yes , I 've always known . " ? Vhat could be more natural , after all that happened between ns ? Only it was difficult to think of Ernest as natural . I told Gregg about it . Gregg comes when Ernest is at the office , he runs his own business , he can walk out and leave it when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of Ernest , he owns four department stores , soon he 'll have a chain of them across England . I ought to have married him , but Gregg 's too wide-awake to get married . He can do better for himself . No one could twist Gregg any way lie did n't want to go , he never fits round my little finger . That 's why I feel Gregg is n't permanent . Meantime , he treats me well enough . I have the things most women want and ca n't get  --  clothes , chocolates , the best cigarettes , some jewelry  --  but not much and not very expensive , because Gregg is not serious about me . Sometimes we go out , a good way out , and find a place to dance and have tea . Occasionally I tell Ernest I 'm going home to see my father and brothers and Gregg and I get away for the weekend . Then everything looks clean and crisp to me , because I 'm somewhere Ernest has never been . When 1 told Gregg that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said had I noticed that Ernest looked a bit like Crippen . It never occurred to me to be afraid , because l knew Ernest would try to kill me in a little mean way which I could easily meet . What I felt was anger and disgust  --  anger at his daring to ape a full-sized man 's emotion , and disgust at the sneaking thing he made of it . He could n't lose his temper , his blood ran slower and colder when I insulted him . He wanted to kill me , but he could not come at it honestly in a rage , he crept about , nursing himself to some small spite to catch me unawares . I had only my instinct to warn me , he never gave away what he was thinking by a word or look . I tried to goad him and he only gazed at me as if he were drowning . That Sunday , when he came back from his walk , I told him I would have to sleep by myself . My nerves , I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the chance of taking me unawares any night in my sleep . It was a wise move , he was upset . He tried to plead with me . It must have put him out because he sat for a long time with his head in his hands . DAY or two later , I found the note . He had left out a suit to go to the cleaner 's and I went through the pockets before I packed it up . He must have overlooked this note for it was half inside the torn lining . The paper was pink and the writing about as fine as a barn door . It said , " Darling Ernest , when are you coming to see me again ? I often think of the wonderful times we have together . I miss you so much but I know you are busy and I try not to mind . Please look after yourself and come as soon as you can . Your loving Laura . " It was dated a couple of weeks back and there was no address . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised . For a long time I could n't believe I could have been so wrong about Ernest . It was one of the things I had against him that I could read his thoughts  --  or what passed as thoughtswith him . I never read anything in them about a Laura , a mistress . I could n't get over it , if he had been a man I would have understood ; men have to do these things . But he was n't a man , he was a weakling without any instinct except to creep . It took me a while to get used to the idea of Ernest with another woman . It was n't funny or provoking , it was squalid . That 's what he does to everything he touches , even ordinary natural things  --  he smuts them . I told Gregg about it that same afternoon . All he said was , " Good for Ernie . He ought to have a girl . " I could imagine what she was like  --  a poor mean scrap ; Ernest could n't afford to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him was just trade talk , she seemed to dote on having him around . I always thought Ernest was down below ground level  --  was there someone low enough to look up to him ? When he came home that night , I let him see there was going to be a scene . He hates scenes , I think he 'd crawl on the ground to me to stave one off . I kept him guessing for an hour or so . He was on edge and could n't eat his dinner properly . That annoyed me because I hate to see good food wasted . He apologized , holding his hands together to stop them twitching , and then he looked more like a mouse than a rabbit . When I said I 'd found a letter from his kept woman , he pretended to be bewildered . If I had n't known his methods I might have been deceived . He kept asking what I meant , what letter , what woman . So I held it up for him to see , though I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be useful to have . He took one look , and then he actually smiled as if in relief . I suppose it was n't the most incriminating letter I could have found . And he said  --  it was the best he could do at short notice  --  that the note was from his old landlady 's little girl Laura , who was only twelve and bedridden from birth . When he was in digs there , he said , he used to sit by her in the evenings and cheer her up . Surely I had n't been upsetting myself thinking he could even look at another woman ? Did n't I know that there was n't anybody , anywhere , who could hold a candle to me ? Did n't I know that he worshipped me  --  yes , wor-shipped  --  although the Bible said you should worship no one but God ? I did not let that impress me . I told him I was no idol , and while 1 had brains I would use them . The cripple-girl story was new , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Dr. Barnado 's rocking the babies before I believed it . He stared at me and said but surely I could see the note had come from a child  --  it was a child 's writing . " Just because your mistress is illiterate , does n't prove she 's a child or a cripple . I 'm keeping this note , it 's more useful to me than to you . But you 'd better go and see tier some evening . She says she misses you  --  what she really misses , of course , is the money . " That unnerved him , his face went the color of wax . He pleaded , he begged he was crazy to convince me that it was all a mistake , that he had never touched another woman ; this was only his little friend writing to him , his little crippled friend who cut pictures out of magazines with him . He wanted me to go with him to see her and prove he was telling the truth . I said I felt ill with all the commotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot milk and biscuits . I poured the milk down the bathroom basin and hid the biscuits because I think he 'll try to poison me . If I did n't know I can be a jump ahead of him all the time , I would n't stay in the house . I WAS very careful . 1 arranged it so that he was never left alone with the food either before or after it was dished up , and once , when Gregg called me on the phone just as I was putting a pie on the table and Ernest was in the room alone with it for a while , I pretended I had a bilious attack threatening and I did n't eat any of the pie . He must have thought I was simple because he tried to get me to take one of his indigestion powders . He carries them in a flat box in his pocket , as a man carried cigarettes . I daresay one or two of those packets are marked , and if they do n't contain arsenic , it 's something just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it to me. 1 do n't know what his defense would be at the trial  --  no doubt he has some story worked out , and 1 daresay he believes it already . He tells everyone I 'm not strong and need to rest . It 's a pity my looks and my country color do n't bear him out . He 's such a creature , he believes his own lies to make them true , and he thinks other people will take them for gospel . I SHALL never know how he did it , but one day , almost a week after I found out about his woman , he managed to dose me with one of those powders . He must have done it at breakfast time , because halfway through the morning , just as I was getting ready to go to the shops , I suddenly doubled up with pain in my stomach . I never thought anyone could suffer so . I rolled on the floor like an animal , with my knees up to my chin . The pain searched about inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time , even , to be afraid of what was happening . When it eased , I crawled to the phone and called the doctor . I told him to come at once because I 'd been poisoned . That would n't look too well for Ernest if anything happened to me . Then 1 mixed a strong dose of soap and hot water . That made me sick and 1 thought perhaps I should be all right , but just as I was going back into the sitting room , the pain started again . I fell on my knees in the hall and I think I prayed for it not to be so bad this time . Whether it was prayers or the soap and 1 water that helped , I do n't know , for the pain grew less and less and I was able to stand upright . I left the front door ajar and lay down on the settee . I had no more pain before the doctor came . He wanted to know why I thought I 'd been poisoned . I said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with his eyebrows up , asked a few questions , and gave me an emetic . This time I was n't able to be particularly sick and he did n't look very impressed . He told me to go and get undressed so that he could give me a thorough examination . In the middle of it , I had the pains again and by the time they passed , he was more sympathetic . He finished the examination , then he said I had appendicitis and would have to be operated on . The hospital was full to overflowing , but he thought he could arrange for me to go in the next day . The ambulance would be round at eight and there was nothing to be afraid of . I let him ramble on . I felt that this dose of poison had done its worst . The soap and water had removed most of it , and Ernest had probably miscalculated the amount anyway . The doctor helped me to bed and asked a neighbor to look in on me now and again . Ernest was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course he pretended he was worried at my being ill and tried to tempt me to eat things lie concocted in the kitchen . He did n't know I was aware of his plans ; he had n't sufficient intelligence even to wonder if I suspected . The doctor said it was appendicitis , and of course 1 was too ignorant of my own stomach to know the difference between appendicitis and poison . He hovered round , smoothing my pillow , bringing hot-water bottles and fidgeting about whether I was too hot or too cold , until I was tired of it and I turned him out and locked the door . Time after time during the night 1 heard him come outside and listen . He was impatient , and he was waiting to see what would happen next . He had n't stopped trying . At first I managed to doze a little , but I was tense and uneasy in my bed and 1 kept waking . I tried to plan what I should do ; I was n't in the least afraid of Ernest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn this poison business back on him , fix him with it for life . It would be justice for Ernest if his own plotting gave me the chance to roll him under my thumb and keep him there . But I could n't quite see how to do it and although I felt weak and groggy , I could n't sleep because of the plans sifting through in my head . I T WAS broad daylight when I got up and took three aspirins . Ernest was creeping about outside . He knocked softly on my door and I went and put my ear to the panel . I could just hear his breathing and the creak of the floor boards as he moved away . I went back to bed and I was just thinking how it was no wonder people took to poisoning if it was so easy to fool the doctors , when the pain stabbed across and across me , sharper than ever . I curled up like a hand , and my face was forced down into the pillow so that I nearly suffocated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only had time to realize that Ernest had caught me neatly by slipping poisoned pills among the aspirin tablets before it started again . I fainted then , and when I came round I was in the ambulance going to the hospital and Ernest was there , rubbing his blue chin and stooping about as if his breathing might disturb me . I wanted to know how they 'd got into my room . Ernest told me not to worry , he had n't damaged the door because the key of the spare room fitted my lock . I saw that I 'd been a fool for the third and perhaps the last time . The next two days were lost to me . They were swallowed up in sleep and weakness after the operation . Yes , they operated ; they took away my appendix and left me to be happy ever after . They have great faith , in these hospitals , in the power of the knife . At first I tried to give them my opinion . but they knew better than that , and I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAGAZINE recovered from the poisoning and had my wits about me again . So now I lie here and plan how to catch Ernest with his own bait . I do n't need to read or be amused because I have a lot to think about . Ernest comes often to visit me  --  you see how simple and trusting they are ; they think everything is just what it seems . Ernest is simple and trusting too . He imagines I 'm deceived , that I believe in appendicitis and never think of poison . But I know what it means when he brings me jellies and tries to hand me my cup of tea from the trolley . I know why he has asked for a week off from the office so that he can look after me when I go home . I know how these actions must be read , and when he says I am to have a change soon and go away by myself , I understand how far he means me to go . Yes , I understand it all  --  that 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
