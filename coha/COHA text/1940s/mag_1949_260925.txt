The patient was 23 years old and seemed to be a good-looking girl . But the first question Dr. Louis William Mara-ventano was asked in his Yonkers ( N.Y. ) office was : " What am I , a man or a woman ? " " Joan " ( the real name was withheld ) was a pseudohermaphrodite* whose external genitals resembled both male and female organs . Something had gone wrong ( doctors are not sure just how ) during fetal development when the time came for the undifferentiated sex organs to become either completely male or completely female . The condition occurs in about one in 1,000 births ; accurate figures are hard to come by because of family reticence . <P> Joan had been brought up and had gone through high school as a girl ; she had taken a secretarial course as a girl . But she knew that something was wrong . Menstruation had not started at the usual time . After puberty , hair had begun to grow on her face , and she had to shave every day . She used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore falsies to build out her flat chest . She had few dates with men . <P> Preliminary examination ( the distribution of body hair , etc. ) indicated that Joan was primarily male , but an operation might show that the doctors and Joan could choose . Said Joan : " I 'd rather be a man . " <P> A month ago , at Yonkers Professional Hospital , Dr. Maraventano and his assistants went to work , in an operation lasting three hours . The operation revealed a true testicle in the left side of the groin . In the pelvis , there were an undifferentiated " boggy mass " and suggestions of vestigial Fallopian tubes , but no true uterus and no ovarian tissue . By plastic surgery Dr. <P> Maraventano freed the obscured clitoris-like penis , closed up the vagina-like introitus , moved the testicle into a scrotal sac formed from the labia majora . Then he made a canal in the freed penis . After the surgery was completed , a series of treatments with testosterone , the male sex hormone , followed . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " John " ( as the doctors called him after the operation ) can have normal sex relations . Later tests on the fertility of the sperm will show whether it is possible for him to become a father . <P> Last week John was back at his home in Yonkers , but he will soon look for a new life as a male secretary in another city . There would still be lots of prob lems . Said the new male : " Really I am only one month old . " <P> <P> * " Pseudo " because , however strangely mixed the genitals may appear , the reproductive glands of only one sex are present . True hermaphrodites , with both ovarian and testicular tissue , are extremely rare ; only about 30 authenticated cases appear in medical literature .
