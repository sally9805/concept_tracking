The State Department was buzzing with vim &; vigor last week , and its collective face was wreathed in smiles of jolly good fellowship . Painters slapped pistachio green on the drab cream walls of State 's drafty old home on Washington 's Pennsylvania Avenue . A panting porter lugged away Cordell Hull 's cherished rubber plant . Under scaffolds and around carpet-menders , platinum-topped Secretary of State Edward R. Stettinius bustled like a busy host at a party . He invited the press to the swearing-in of five of his six new top aides , * whom he fondly calls his team . In the midst of the ceremony , he invited able Dean Acheson , the only big holdover from Hull 's regime , to make a speech . Said Acheson , pointing to his freshly confirmed teammates : " These are the little pigs who went to market-I am the little pig who stayed home . " Ed Stettinius laughed with the rest . <P> Then Secretary Stettinius led newsmen , photographers and team into a conference room , and , pointer in hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopeful correspondent interjected : " Winston Churchill has made another speech . . . . " Ed Stettinius brushed her aside with a wave of his classroom pointer . The State Department 's big news was the new State Department . <P> Next day Ed Stettinius hired a hall ( the D.A.R . ' s Constitution Hall ) for $478.20 , the bill to be paid by himself and team . Some 2,500 employes-clerks , decoders , secretaries and porters-heard the U.S. Marine Band toot out Colonel Bogey March and El Capitan and then watched as Ed Stettinius , with unflagging enthusiasm , presented his new assistants . <P> It was encouraging to see the clubhouse so full of such team spirit . But the big game was waiting . The first half was over , the score looked bad , and the spectators were anxious . <P> <P> *The sixth , Brigadier General Julius C. Holmes , is back in France .
