Scientists cheered another indication that the Atomic Age was starting to roll . After long delay and soul-searching , the Manhattan District this week agreed to supply qualified customers with about 100 radioactive isotopes produced in its Oak Ridge uranium piles . For chemists , physicists and biologists the isotopes are important scientific tools . <P> Most crying need for them is in medicine , not to cure disease ( though the isotopes may do this too ) , but to probe basic biological processes . Radioactive carbon 14 , for example , may be fed to human beings or laboratory animals . Though present only in sub-microscopic quantities , it will announce its presence to sensitive instruments . Physiologists can follow it through the body , even into individual cells . <P> Medicine is but one promising field for the isotopes . Chemists will also use them as " tracers . " Physicists will use them as cheap , convenient sources of powerful radioactivity . In many industrial fields-electronics is an obvious case-Oak Ridge 's isotopes are certain to stimulate new research . <P> Before the uranium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by cyclotrons , and were enormously expensive . The pile produces them much more cheaply , for any substance exposed to the hurricane of neutrons which rages inside the pile quickly becomes radioactive . They are still expensive by ordinary standards , but their cost should fall rapidly . Production at Oak Ridge will be supervised by practical Monsanto Chemical Co.
