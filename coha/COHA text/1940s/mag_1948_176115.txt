For 24 years the Federal Trade Commission poked and jabbed at heavy industry 's . basing-point system , of pricing . Under that system , producers absorbed enough freight costs to " meet competition " in areas distant from their mills , added " phantom freight " costs on some short-haul sales . Thus they got to identical prices at any given destination . Last April , the Supreme Court upheld FTC 's charge that such identical prices added up to trustlike collusion . The court ordered the defendants in the case , the cement industry , to drop the basing-point system . The order went into effect last week . <P> The industry was feeling no pain : with cementmakers now selling f.o.b. at their mills , the savings on freight absorption meant increased earnings . Consumers were in a different boat : with airfreight costs now added to their bills , buyers suddenly found the delivered price of cement boosted as much as 25% , depending on the distance from producer to purchaser . <P> Strategic Surrender . Then U.S. Steel Corp . made a surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it too would switch to an f.o.b. system . Bethlehem Steel Corp. , Wheeling Steel Corp. , and Youngstown Sheet &; Tube Co. promptly followed suit , signaling an industry-wide changeover . <P> Some steel distributors , without waiting to hear what the new costs would be , immediately upped their warehouse prices 5% to 10% , Some users expected eventually to be paying-and passing on-as much as 20% more , for steel . <P> Big Steel 's statement about " no recourse " to the contrary , the only pressure to do away with the basing-point system in the steel business was strictly internal . FTC 's case against steel was not due to come up for months , and probably could have been kept from final decision for years . But if they had to give in some time , steelmen figured , the ' ' best possible time was during the present sellers ' market . In addition to boosting current profit , the switch to an f.o.b. price system would bring pressure on Congress , from thousands of high-paying steel users , to authorize a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy would be widespread . FTC says that there are 191,907 companies which use basing points . As industry 's bellwether , Big Steel had set a pattern which thousands would follow . As a result , U.S. consumers might soon have to pay more for a whole lot of things - for furniture , oil , machinery , paper and hundreds of other items . <P> Consumer Endurance . It was a tough week all around for consumers . To pay for the new wage gains of John L. Lewis &; Co. , soft coal mines boosted their prices 4 to 50 a ton ( retail equivalent : up to $1.25 a ton ) . Though hard coal producers had raised prices only a month ago to cover higher wages , one of the biggest of them , Lehigh Navigation Coal Co. , Inc. , raised the ante again , by as much as $1.10 a ton . A few hours after the rail-wage fight was settled ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) , the Interstate Commerce Commission gave 61 Eastern railroads permission to boost passenger fares an average of 17% ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers ' standards , it meant that coach travel was now as expensive ( 3 a mile ) as Pullman travel was before the war .
