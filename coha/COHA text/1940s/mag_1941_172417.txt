Since the late Andrew Mellon 's new National Gallery of Art opened its bronze doors on Washington 's Constitution Mall ( TIME , March 24 ) , many a critical connoisseur has looked Philanthropist Mellon 's gigantic gift straight in the pink marble mouth . Architects have grumbled that the National Gallery is as massively old-fashioned as Grant 's Tomb . Artists complained that the gallery ought to have made some provision for accepting contemporary art . Connoisseurs sniffed that its collection is sadly deficient in French art . <P> Dean Joseph Hudnut , of Harvard 's Graduate School of Design , has a seeing eye for architectural pretense . He has paid his respects to the campuses of the large Eastern colleges in a little pamphlet called The Gothick Universitie ; he has likened Washington 's unfinished Jefferson Memorial to " an egg on a pantry shelf in the midst of a geometric Sahara . " Last week Dean Hudnut took a look at the National Gallery . Wrote he ( in an article in the Magazine of Art ) : <P> " It invites at every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense and weight , crushing him under its firm assertion of authority . All of which adds nothing of delight or of value to the objects exhibited-nothing , that is to say , which could not have been added simply , directly , unpretentiously , at one tenth of the cost . . . . It is the death mask of an ancient culture . "
