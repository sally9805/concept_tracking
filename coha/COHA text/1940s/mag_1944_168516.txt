The 1944 Presidential campaign battle began bitterly in Congress last week . In a truculent message , President Roosevelt accused the Senate of attempting to perpetrate a " fraud on the soldiers and sailors and marines " and " on the American people . " <P> The President 's message applied to the Soldiers ' Voting bill passed by the Senate last December , and approved by the House Elections Committee last fortnight . Under this bill , which leaves the whole matter of soldier voting to the states , the President charged that " the vast majority " of the 11,000,000 men &; women in the armed services would be deprived of the vote in 1944 . Analyzing the states ' cumbersome absentee-voting methods , he pointed out that only 17 states have scheduled legislative sessions to simplify these procedures . The solution , said the President , is a federal ballot , as provided in the bills sponsored in the Senate by Illinois ' Scott Lucas and Rhode Island 's Theodore Green , and in the House by Texas ' handsome young ( 29 ) Eugene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the South Pacific . <P> " Interested Citizen . " The Senate heard the President 's message out in silence . To most of them this kind of attack was familiar . House Republicans booed the charge of fraud . The President took a deep dig at House procedure . A plan had been laid to bring up the Worley bill under a rule which would let it be shouted down by voice vote , with no recording of yeas &; nays . President Roosevelt suggested that every Congressman should be willing to " stand up and be counted " on this vital issue . He said he felt he was within his rights in suggesting this , " as an interested citizen . " At this the House seethed with mocking laughter . <P> In the Senate , two days before , Ohio 's Republican Robert Taft had charged that Secretaries Stimson and Knox , in arguing for the federal ballot , had shown that they " are today running for a fourth term " because they regard themselves as indispensable to the conduct of the war . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ordinarily dry and legal in manner , leaped up with red face and flailing arms . He called the President 's message a " direct insult " to Congress , and charged that the President is planning to line up soldiers for the Fourth Term " as the WPA workers were marched to the polls . " <P> Oregon 's Rufus C. Holman proceeded to make the blurt-of-the-week : " It seems to me that the difficulty centers around the fact that the Commander in Chief of the Army is himself a candidate for the Presidency . If he would eliminate himself from that advantageous or unfair position , I think debate on the pending bill would cease . " <P> Democrat Abe Murdock of Utah thrust like a shark at this vulnerable opening . " I know it is the prayer in his heart , and it is the prayer in the heart of every other good , old , stand-pat Republican in the United States today . . . that Franklin D. Roosevelt would eliminate himself from politics and give them at least a shadow of a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say to them . . . the American people still want Roosevelt . "
