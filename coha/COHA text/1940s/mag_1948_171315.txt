THE BEARS ' FAMOUS INVASION OF SICILY ( 147 pp. ) - Dino Buzzati , translated by Frances Lobb- Pantheon ( $2.75 ) . <P> Leander was no ordinary monarch . He was King of the bears of Sicily . Thirteen years ago , he had led them down from the mountains , defeated the Grand Duke 's army of mere men and captured the capital . Leander had ruled well , but traffic with human beings had corrupted his kindly , naive bears . They took to wearing clothes , learned to steal and gamble and to stage bacchanalian orgies . Now the King had been shot by his own chamberlain . On his deathbed , the King spoke slowly : <P> " Go back to the mountains . Leave this city , where you have found riches but not peace of mind . Take off those ridiculous human clothes . Throw away your gold . Abandon your cannon , your rifles , and all the other devilish contraptions that men have shown you . Return to what you were before . " <P> Next day , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the bears went back to the mountains . <P> Out of Italy , which gave the world Pinocchio , has come a new and fine children 's story , the kind that grownups borrow from kids . It was written , half in prose and half in verse , by Dino Buzzati , 41 , a wrinkly-eyed Italian newspaperman and novelist . <P> Buzzati has illustrated The Bears himself , with drawings as gravely whimsical as his text . He drew some of them many years ago to amuse his nieces , drew more and wrote the story around them in Milan during the tedious evenings of the German occupation . Last year , when the book was published in Italy , many Italian readers decided that the bears of the story were Sicily 's U.S. invaders , and read meanings into it that the author never intended , since he had conceived the idea long before . <P> Last week Buzzati , who is an editor of Milan 's Corriere delta Sera , got a letter from his U.S. publisher telling him that " a group of elderly ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your book , " and that some U.S. bookstores refused to handle The Bears . Said Buzzati : " I am dumfounded . The whole point of the book is that conquest finally corrupts . " <P> The elderly ladies are not the only U.S. opposition Buzzati 's kindly bears face . Like any proper once-upon-a-timer , The Bears has an ogre and a necromancer , and good routs evil with the help of magic wands . It has other things which some readers may decide are strong meat for youngsters : gambling , drunkenness , assassination and ghosts . Buzzati handles these matters with such disarming candor and good sense that only the most squeamish parent will fear for childish innocence . And he has also , in his book , tried to answer people who say that children should not hear ghost stories .
