The vital rubber city of Akron last week was beating off a streamlined version of the old labor-pirating racket . Swamped with war orders and short of skilled workers , 20 small , back-alley machine shops had hijacked machinists from bigger war plants . Their system was simple : each would hire someone else 's skilled worker away as a " private contractor , " let him " bid " on each job he turned out and " rent " the machine he worked on . Technically , this wile put the worker in business for himself . Thus the worker who changed jobs needed no WMC statement of availability , and by " bidding " for jobs , neatly dodged WLB wage ceilings as well . <P> Biggest loser to the pirates was Goodyear Aircraft Corp. , makers of fighting planes . When the loss of 60 men hurt production , Goodyear complained . WMC cracked down hard , ordered all hijacked workers back to . their former jobs . Two shops got around the order by taking the hijacked men into partnership .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
