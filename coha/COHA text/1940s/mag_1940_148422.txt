Louisville , Ky. is a one-paper town . Barry Bingham 's proud old Courier-Jour nal ( with its evening edition , the Times ) constitutes a virtual news monopoly in the middle Ohio Valley : it has no serious competitor nearer than Cincinnati . Both papers are healthy , with circulations ( Courier-Journal , 109,361 ; Times , 121,854 ) that are still growing . <P> But monopolistic ease contents not Publisher Bingham nor his general manager , Mississippi-born Mark Foster Ethridge ( onetime president of the National Association of Broadcasters ) . They have ideas and ideals , they keep on spending money for new features , now &; again take a full page to render their readers an " Account of Our Stewardship . " <P> The Courier-Journal stopped its presses for one minute on the 100th birthday of its founder , the late Colonel Henry Watterson . Of that fierce , opinionated , ex-Confederate cavalryman , who made the old Courier-Journal a fiery organ of Southern Democracy , Arthur Krock ( onetime editorial manager of Marse Henry 's paper ) wrote in the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great personal editors . . . . His writings were more widely reprinted , quoted and heeded , than those of any other journalist ; and his personality became a legend . . . . " For weeks the Courier-Journal had been in the throes of a mysterious upheaval , changing its makeup , trying out new editorial formulas , hiring new men ( one was James Pope , managing editor of the Atlanta Journal for 15 years ) . Last week Bingham 's Ethridge explained what they were up to : the Courier-Journal was heading back toward Colonel Watterson 's editorial individualism . <P> Said Manager Ethridge : " We are trying to reverse the trend which has been running since personal journalism faded . In recent years , when a man got to be good enough as a reporter to get forty dollars a week , some brass hat stuck him on a desk and deprived the paper of the thing for which it had trained him . Too many good writing men have been stifled by titles . We want to get writing men back to writing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a place somewhere in provincial America for a newspaper that will have the intelligence and influence of the Manchester Guardian of the old days . We have no fancy notions about being a national newspaper , but we intend to dig under the spot news of what is going on . . . . <P> " Spot news is important enough but much less important than it was before radio came along . Every poll or survey has . . . shown the great unworked field of newspapers as elaborators and interpreters . . . . <P> " For a long time daily newspapers have been magazines , running largely , though , to the light and comic type . We are going to put more weight and bulk into the Courier-Journal in the belief that America has passed her adolescence , and readers are willing now to learn the facts of life .
