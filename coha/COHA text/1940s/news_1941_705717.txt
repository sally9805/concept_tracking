txt After a turbulent session today the House struck from the May bill its defense labor provisions , and its action brought a charge by Representative Smith of Virginia that " goon squads " of the Congress of Industrial Organizations had intimidated the members by threats of political extermination . All that was left of a five-page bill after the House finished its consideration was a one-paragraph measure to lower the ' draft age to 28 and to require publicity by draft boards as to reasons for deferments . This measure was then adopted , with the final vote on the I draft age section being 345 to 17 . The House voted , 218 to 151. by roll-call , to delete from the bill a provision defining as a " refusal " on the part of either employer or ' . employe a failure to submit disputes to government arbitration . And then , by a recorded vote of 220 to 150 , it struck from the bill provisions which would give the President power to take over plants during an emergency or during wartime , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from entering struck plants . In his attack on the C. I. 0 . , Representative Smith charged that the organization , after its conference here Monday , had organized " goon squads " of three to visit each member of Congress . Assails " Disgraceful Episode " " No such disgraceful episode flak happened in the American Congress since the investigation took place over the death sentence clause in the utility bill ( in 1935 ) , " Mr. Smith told the ' House , as several members shouted " No ! " " Why do these ' goon squads ' call on you gentlemen ' in squaclg of three ? It is a little part of ? the technique of intimidation . One of them of course could have told us just as much about this ' case as three . But , no , they had to have three . That little touch of intimidation on members of Congress ; " And I am wondering how some of these members are going to feel when they go home tonight and have voted against saying they condemn violence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. I. 0 . came to their offices and sought to intimidate them and sought to coerce them // HOUSE BANS CURBS ON DEFENSE LABOR // with the threat of politicaLdestruction. if they failed to obey the orders of John L. Lewis and the C. I. 0 . That is the situation . " We all know it , and we are going to have an opportunity to let John L. Lewis and the C. I. 0 . and the American people know whether the duly elected representatives of 1 the whole people are going to be coerced and intimidated into voting against the bill to prevent coercion and intimidation of other American citizens . " Representative Arends of Illinois shouted that the House was acting under the influence also of " the same Harry Bridges West Coast C. I . 0 . maritime leader whom we voted to deport . " Representative Mary T. Norton of New Jersey , chairman of the Labor Committee , denounced the Smith charge , and Representative of Illinois called the charges a reflection on " the integrity , patriotism and good sound judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just before the House took the record votes on amendments by Representative Healey of Massachusetts to strike out the labor provisions . Among those who voted for the , Healey amendments was Representative McCormack , majority leader , who , with Speaker Rayburn , was credited with a major part is the defeat of attempts of the House Military Affairs Committee to condemn defense strikes . The adoption of the Healey amendments was made possible by a heavy Republican vote . Several Republicans said later that they were voting for the Healey amendments because they felt that the President , as evidenced by his action in sending the Army recently to open the struck North Ameri- ? can Aviation plant at Inglewood , Calif. , already possessed the power sought to be conferred on him through the bill . The House refused to adopt an amendment by Representative Robertson of Virginia which would have put Congress on record as condemning strikes in defense industries . A similar amendment had been adopted in the Senate . Today 's action by the House apparently means that there will be no defense labor legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill providing certain defense labor restrictions , but in the course of parliamentary procedure it barred , by its voting , any consideration in conference of labor legislation . When the bill goes to conference , the House conferees can only disagree over ' draft age provisions  --  which do not differ appreciably from those of the Senate  --  and ask for further instructions from the House . But the House would have to reverse its action of today to permit defense labor consideration by the conferees . Aside from voting with the Senate to lower the draft age to 28 , the House adopted the amendment by Representative Cole of Maryland , which would require draft boards to post publicly their reasons for the deferment of men . The House refused to provide automatic deferment for men upon reaching their twenty-eighth birthday , as proposed by Representative Halleck of Indiana . It also refused to adopt an amendment by Representative Osmers of New Jersey to remove the service exemption now accorded to members of the legislative bodies of the States and the Federal Government . The House declined to approve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discharge of all trainees now in service who have reached the age of 29 , it they apply within thirty days .
