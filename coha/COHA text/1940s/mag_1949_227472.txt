Jovial Dr. Alfred Bilmanis , Latvian Minister to the U.S. , had been a pet of Washington society . In his comfortable 17th Street home , he loved to relax over a mellow wine and a fine cigar , converse in any of six languages . But when he attended formal diplomatic parties , as he did frequently , he became a thorny symbol . The State Department had never recognized the armed annexation of his country by Russia . Russian diplomats bitterly resented his presence at White House functions , coolly declined invitations on the grounds of illness if he was to be present . " Bilmanitis " became a Washington gag . When he died last year , the Russians recovered from Bilmanitis . But they well knew that they might have a relapse . While there is no Latvian Government in Exile , Latvian Minister to London Karlis Zarins still holds the extraordinary power to appoint diplomats ( granted him by his government just before the Russians took over ) . <P> Last week , mild-mannered Jules Feldmans , carrying his credentials as charge d'affaires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a government ) , was given the full and formal State Department protocol treatment in Washington . He was warmly received by Secretary of State Acheson . For six minutes , lounging in a leather armchair , Feldmans told of the plight of 80,000 Latvian D.P.s who would like to come to the U.S. The State Department put Feldmans ' name on the official list of diplomats . Mr. Feldmans did not call on the President , but it was announced unofficially that Mrs. Truman would entertain him at tea at Blair House , along with other freshman members of the capital 's diplomatic corps , as soon as the fall season opens . Presumably , Washington 's Russian diplomats were already feeling the first hot flushes of Feldmanitis.
