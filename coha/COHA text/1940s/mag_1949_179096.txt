See Cover <P> The day was crisp and sunny , but a cold wind whipped through the marble columns of the white Arlington amphitheater , riffling the rows of flags . At 11 o'clock a can non thudded out the first salvo of the slow , rolling 19-gun salute and a flag-draped caisson moved slowly up from the Arlington gate , bearing the first U.S. Secretary of Defense to a sailor 's grave . <P> From the flower-banked stage a minister intoned the words of the Episcopal burial service : " I am the resurrection and the life . . . Death is swallowed up in victory . O death , where is thy sting ? O grave , where is thy victory ? " An honor guard of Marine riflemen fired three sharp volleys over the plain white wooden marker : " James V. Forrestal , Lieut . U.S.N. " and a Marine bugler sounded taps .

In this he had largely failed . Louis Johnson had moved in like a combine advancing on a field of summer wheat . He set out " to crack a few heads together , " and he did so by bold and brusque decisions . In his fourth week in office he ordered the Navy to scrap its biggest dreamboat , the $188 million supercarrier , United States , and ended naval aviation 's dream of striking at the heart of any enemy with the atomic bomb . The strategic bombing role would go to Secretary Stuart Symington 's Air Force .
