Ammonium nitrate , whose blast wrecked Texas City last week ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) is all too easy to make . The recipe : add ammonia to dilute nitric acid . <P> Chemically , ammonium nitrate is a salt , a combination of a base and an acid . But it is far from peaceful , as most other salts are . Instead of having a metal ( e.g. , sodium or iron ) as the basic part of its molecule , it has an ammonium " radical " ( one nitrogen atom and four hydrogen atoms ) masquerading as a metal . Its acid part is also a radical : one nitrogen and three oxygen atoms ( see chart ) . <P> Ammonium nitrate 's outwardly peaceful molecule perpetually strains with suppressed desires . The oxygen and hydrogen atoms are not combined with each other , as their natures prompt them to be . They fret in frustrated juxtaposition , kept from an explosive embrace by a frangible barrier of chemical propriety . <P> Under ordinary conditions , the straining atoms contain themselves . But a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of certain impurities , shatters the barrier . Every oxygen atom grabs two hydrogen atoms . Every pair of nitrogen atoms , deserted , grabs a single oxygen . In consummating these unions , the atoms generate enormous heat-and the salt flashes into gases : superheated steam ( H2O ) and nitrous oxide ( N2O ) .
