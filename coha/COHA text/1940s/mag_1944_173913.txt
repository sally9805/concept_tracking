Liberated Brussels made liberated Paris seem restrained . Sweaty British Tommies had to push hard to get through the shrieking , kissing , singing throngs . Said one : " This is the first time since D-day that I 've been offered a cigaret instead of asked for one . " <P> Hate for the Germans ran strong in Brussels . Said a well-groomed hostess at an impromptu cocktail party : " I would n't mind a bit if some German soldiers were brought into my parlor right now and shot . I 'd glory in the bloodstains on my carpet . " Wrote a correspondent : " It does n't seem incongruous to come across a grey-haired old lady , laughingly pointing to the body of a dead German soldier . " Said a choked-up Brussels merchant : " The swine have overrun us twice in a single generation . " For the second time retreating Germans burned the Library of Louvain. * <P> The Animals . In Antwerp , joyous burghers rounded up remaining Germans and collaborationists , stuck them in empty cages at the zoo-officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pens , wailing women in the wildcat cages . The day before , a troop of flustered " Mice " - grey- clad German women auxiliaries-had piled their belongings on a truck , which then drove off . The truck was driven by members of Belgium 's underground " White Brigade , " would never reach the Reich . <P> Grinning Belgians made a point of sitting at sidewalk cafs to sip beer or lemonade and watch the retreat-tattered , dusty men , walking , piled on horse-drawn carts , or riding bicycles which were sometimes without tires . Madly the Germans tried to exchange rum , margarine and other rations for civilian clothes . Fascist Rexists had waited three days at the railway station for a train that never came , then slunk off to hide as best they could . Said a German officer : " We do not like traitors ; we merely use them . " <P> Into delirious Brussels came Premier Hubert Pierlot and the Government in Exile . They found less damage than they had feared , more food than they expected . On Belgium 's small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns , people shrugged at K rations , offered fresh food in return . But in the crowded working-class quarters there was hunger . <P> Said Pierlot : " The Government will direct its efforts to the restoration of the national life , the liberation of Belgium and the King . . . . Elections will be held . . . after voting lists have been revised and prisoners returned . " <P> Premier Pierlot and his Government , in office since before the Germans came , had promised to resign when liberation was a fact . But they needed a king to resign to , and Leopold was a prisoner in Germany . Nervously they talked of a regency . <P> Few Belgians still blame the King for his 1940 surrender , but many blame him for not encouraging resistance . Still others resent his second marriage after the death ( in a car he was driving ) of popular , Swedish-born Queen Astrid . To all these Belgians , a regency for Astrid 's handsome son , Prince Baudouin , 14 , looked good . The next few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked equally good . <P> * Rebuilt in 1928 by U.
