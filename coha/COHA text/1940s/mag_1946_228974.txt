The Congress , pondering what to do about the strike problem , got all kinds of advice last week . <P> Dr. William M. Leiserson , Mediation Board veteran , now a Johns Hopkins professor , recommended a permanent national mediation board to sit with management and labor before future disputes reached the strike stage . ( " But make no mistake-no legislation will be a cureall . . . . Leave this current crisis alone and it will solve itself-and soon . " ) Senator Harry F. Byrd advised his colleagues to pass a law forcing unions to incorporate , register with SEC , report their finances and election procedures , assume responsibility for any breach of contract . <P> The most pungent words came from tousled William H. Davis , who was first chairman of the old War Labor Board . Said he : " . . . Settlement of labor disputes by Government fiat is destructive of all the creative values of collective bargaining . ... I can not impress on you too earnestly . . . the absolute necessity to realize that we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any immediate crisis that seems to confront us . " <P> Would President Truman 's fact-finding program work ? No , said Will Davis - any law was bad which might encourage either industry or labor to expect more from Government intervention than from its own efforts . " The last thing in the world to do is to legislate in the light ... or the heat of the present situation . . . . <P> " I would not have done anything about the General Motors strike . I would have said , ' Go ahead and have your strike . ' . . . They will learn something about it . That is what strikes are for . " <P> The most hopeful suggestion came from Connecticut 's Congresswoman Clare Boothe Luce , who said it was high time to establish " a new principle of relationship between labor and capital " based on a " fair and equitable distribution of the fruits of industry . " Her suggestion : that Congress resume a study of profit-sharing plans which was broken off when war came . <P> Committeemen who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed " islands of ' peace , equity , efficiency and contentment , ' and likewise prosperity , dotting an otherwise turbulent industrial map , all the way across the continent . " To Mrs. Luce , these words still sounded more promising than anything yet said in 1946.
