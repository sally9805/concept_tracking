General George Catlett Marshall served notice last week that so far as he is concerned the world of the future will have to reckon with a powerful U.S. military force . In the war-anniversary issue of the Army &; Navy Journal , he wrote : <P> " Wars are the great tragedies of the human race . . . . Yet it probably has been a good thing to have the great military power of the U.S. fully demonstrated . . . that the world may know for the future that this democracy can and will generate a military force sufficient to overwhelm prospective tyrants of the years to come . " <P> But U.S. civilians were not so sure . With growing heat they debated the Army 's proposed keystone of future military strength : compulsory military training . Yale 's president , urbane , tolerant Dr. Charles Seymour , arose in opposition to most other educators last week when he plumped for compulsory military training for all able-bodied young . " At all costs , " said he , " the nation must possess the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal education . " <P> Notre Dame 's president , the Very Reverend J. Hugh O'Donnell , endorsed a continuation of training after the war , applying the principles of the Selective Service Act , making " more intensive use of universities . . . high schools . . . . " But advocates of peacetime training were far from agreement on what kind of legislation they wanted . Three bills now in the Congressional hopper ( the identical Wadsworth and Gurriey bills and the May bill ) are roughly drawn , little more than primers . <P> While the argument built up , Congressmen stuck to their foxholes , waiting glumly for the battle to break over their heads , as it will when the new 79th Congress convenes next month . The issue was so explosive that many Congressmen wished it could be dropped until war 's end , and that is exactly what anticonscription forces advocated , with one voice . <P> Only one member of Congress dared stick his head out . Hardworking Senator Ed Johnson , of Colorado , an old political warhorse and pre-Pearl Harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have ended . War hysteria will have subsided . Our heads will be cooler ; our judgments better . The veterans will be home . Let the question of compulsory military training become the issue in 1946 . . . . Jingoism , Junkerism , saber rattling and militarism are nationalistic in concept and are dangerous . . . . Certainly ' unconditional surrender ' will not permit war machines in Germany and Japan to rebuild . Then , against whom are we rearming ? "
