No one is quite so heavily sentimental as an old college athlete , especially an old footballer . To Manhattan 's Dean Hill ( Georgia Tech ' 12 ) , football is the old-time religion . He helped found New York 's Touchdown Club to foster good-fellowship among Varsity lettermen , takes flying tackles at journalists who refer to an " All-American " instead of an " All-America " footballer . For 13 years Dean Hill has rummaged through old bookstores and trunks , clipped yellowed papers and magazines , assembled one of the world 's finest collections of footballiana . <P> This week Collector Hill published his glorified football album . Football Thru the Years ( Gridiron Publishing Co. ; $2.50 ) depicts the history of U. S. football-from Rugby 's Bigside and Eton 's Wall Game ( British-born ancestors of U. S. football ) , through the white-canvas-shod , stocking-capped era of the ' 80s , down to the latest award made by the Touchdown Club-with turn-of-the-century photographs , cartoons and illustrations by such artists as the late great Arthur B. Frost and Frederic Remington . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Yale-Princeton game ( see cut ) played in Hoboken on Thanksgiving Day 1879-memorable because 1 ) it resulted in a scoreless tie ; 2 ) Yale 's Captain Walter Camp flabbergasted the referee by asking permission to put in a substitute , though no player had been injured ; 3 ) the cane-carrying referee , who had to arbitrate a free-for-all as well as a game , was Robert Bacon , common-enemy captain of the Harvard team , later U. S. Ambassador to France . <P> Other Hill treasures-trove : <P> &gt; Yale was the first U. S. college to play football with eleven men on each side . <P> &gt; The U. S. football was round , before 1896 . <P> &gt; Harvard built the first U. S. football stadium , in 1903 . <P> &gt; Princeton introduced long hair , canvas jackets ( called " smocks " because they were invented by a student named Smock ) and the famed V formation , forerunner of the momentum mass plays of the ' 90s . <P> &gt; Not until 1904 did a touchdown score more than a field goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules in 1906 , after President Theodore Roosevelt shook his Big Stick at bone-crushing mass plays . <P> &gt; Michigan was the first college to be invited to play in the Rose Bowl , drubbed Stanford 49-to-0 on Jan. 1 , 1902 . <P> &gt; One of football 's few rules that have remained unchanged in 64 years : the distance between the goalposts ( 18 ft. , 6 in. , with crossbars 10 ft. from the ground ) .
