One afternoon last week , on the stage of Washington 's Departmental Auditorium , Brigadier General Lewis Elaine Hershey dipped his hairy hand into a brown wastebasket . He plucked out a cobalt-blue capsule , thrust it behind his back . A brunette young woman snatched the capsule , shook out a piece of paper , handed the paper to a blonde . The blonde attached the paper to a white card , passed the card to a male announcer at a microphone . The announcer spoke meaningless words ( for practice ) into the microphone , handed the card to a Boy Scout . The Boy Scout slipped it to another Boy Scout , and thus from hand to hand of four more Scouts to a blond , wispy young man at a photographic recording machine . With a dainty flourish , the blond young man tripped the shutter of his machine , then handed the card to a pair of young women , who removed the numbered paper , pasted it on a sheet . In the vast auditorium pit , scores of newsmen and photographers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over &; over . Finally , Brigadier General Hershey &; team could handle 14 cards and numbers a minute . <P> All this apparent mummery was serious : it was a rehearsal for the U. S. Selective Service commission 's first draft lottery . <P> Just before noon next day , Brigadier General Hershey 's brunettes , blondes , Boy Scouts and young men took their places . <P> The wastebasket had been replaced by the huge glass jar from which draft numbers were drawn in 1917 . Photographers ' lights beat upon 8,994* blue capsules in the jar , shedding a blue radiance on the stage . Selective Service Director Clarence Addison Dykstra and Brigadier General Hershey walked in . Slowly behind them came President Roosevelt , on the arm of his secretary " Pa " Watson . The blue-suited President looked tired , grey , exhausted by his campaign . Said he to the nation ( paraphrasing a favorite phrase of Wendell Willkie ) and to the 17,000,000 registrants who were about to have their numbers drawn : " . . . <P> Only the strong may continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War Henry Lewis Stimson , 73 , stepped to the jar . Fragile , twittery Lieut . Colonel ( retired ) Charles R. Morris , who blindfolded Newton D. Baker for the first draft drawings of World War I , did the same for Mr. Stimson ( with a bandage made from the cover of a chair in Independence Hall , sanitized with a sheet of Kleenex ) . Secretary Stimson gingerly put his left hand in the jar , took the first capsule he touched , handed it to Mr. Roosevelt . The President , old stager that he was , glanced at the newsreel and radio men , got their nod before he intoned : " The first number is one-five-eight . " Registration serial number 158 , held by some 6.175 registrants throughout the U. S .. thus became Draft Order No. 1 . <P> In the crowded auditorium , Mrs. Mildred C. Bell gasped : 158 was her 21-year-old son Harry 's number . A friend sitting beside her squawked with excitement , bringing newsmen , radio announcers and temporary fame upon the Bells and Harry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience : Herbert Jacob Ehrsam. 34 , a Civil Service Commission employe . Said he : " I did n't know whether to stand up and salute , or just remain quiet . " He kept quiet , and nobody knew he was there .
