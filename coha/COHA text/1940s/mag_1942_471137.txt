WHEN John L. Lewis announced last spring that he intended to organize the nation 's three million dairy farmers into the coal miners ' union the cartoonists had a field day , but in many circles the proposal was greeted with anything but amusement . Heads of the existing farm organizations ? the Farm Bureau , the Grange , the Farmers Union , and regional groups laid aside old jealousies and banded together against the intruder . Labor leaders like William Green and Philip Murray , familiar with upheavals plotted by Lewis , tried to calculate the effect of this one , and politicians on Washington 's Capitol Hill saw a drastic shift in ancient balances of power if Lewis were to gain important influence in the farm bloc . Out to organize men used to thinking of themselves as minor capitalists , Lewis proceeded in a fashion likely to impress them . The Utica , N. Y. , offices of the Dairy Farmers Union , which Lcwis took over as the nucleus for his all-important campaign in the New York City milk shed , were ample . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the southern Illinois mine wars named Ray Thomason , quickly established more spacious headquarters , complete with private offices , efficient secretaries , and the rest of the accouterments of a go-getting commercial enterprise , in the most impressive downtown office building he could find . Within a fortnight each of the nearly sixty thou-sand milk producers in the shed ? which includes the State of New York and parts of New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Connecticut , Massachusetts , and Vermont ? had received a free copy of a newspaper which told of organizers rushing to all corners of the nation by airplane , spoke of unlimited millions to be spent in battling the " milk trust , " and extolled Lewis in every column . Strong talk and action arc not unknown among the dairymen of the New York shed , for intermittently they have been in arms against the dealers for a century . The first recorded strike occurred in 1883 ? it ended in higher prices for consumers but not for farmers ? and numerous strikes have taken place since . Those of recent years have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of the farms in the shed are the family-sized units typical of America , but of all farmers the dairyman undoubtedly toils the hardest and his duties arc the most exacting . The number of cows to a farm ranges up to 50 ; the farmer can handle 10 by himself , and for each additional 15 he must depend on a member of his family or on hired help . Pastures and hay and silage harvests fill part of his feed requirements , but most of his grain is shipped from the Middle West ? which means that unfavorable growing conditions in other areas , as well as his own , can play havoc with his plans . Refrigeration is essential and endless sterilization of pails and cans is required , for the slightest odor will cause his milk to be rejected at the point of delivery . Cows , barn , and water supply must stand frequent inspection . For all this he is not very well paid . Of recent years a complicated marketing scheme known as the Federal-State Marketing Orders has stabilized prices and proved generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's agricultural program has aided him less than others ? a point of view held strongly enough to impress Galluppollers when they tapped around recently in an effort to discover the reaction to Lewis 's campaign . A study of 500 farms by the New York State College of Agriculture of Cornell University showed the average " labor income " for the year ending April 30 , 1940 , to have been $431 , while the value of " privileges , " such as use of dwelling and consumption of fuel , milk , eggs , etc. , was $404 ; or a total income for the farmer 's use of only $835 . Conditions improved to some degree during 1941 , but lately the price of commodities , particularly labor , that the farmer buys has risen more rapidly than the price of his produce . Consequently , while farmers watched in some amazement the brawny and intrepid figure of John L. Lewis in clanking armor galloping to their rescue , they were not altogether disdainful . " We 're between the devil and the deep blue sea , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region . " Lewis is out for the money but so are the others and if he can help us , more power to him . " Another , who doubted that he would join , expressed a willingness to listen to Lewis 's proposition before making up his mind for certain , and added , " I guess it 's a fact that John L. Lewis has never been licked in a fight yet , " indicating that the campaign to make the miners ' leader appear invincible is not without effect . A neighborhood leader of the farm group absorbed by Lewis declared : " Lewis wants power , no doubt of it ; but is n't it a fact that the farmers never had a really big man at their head ? " That the campaign , if pressed with Lewis 's usual energy and resisted by the farm organizations and milk dealers , vi result in major explosions ? perhaps in eluding a strike in late summer or early y fall ? is apparent . Of equal interest is the influence its success or failure will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American of his time ? yet for better or for worse a molder of the nation ? he is as unpredictable as he is competent . His shrewdness and resolution placed him at the head of a great labor movement . Gambling for more power and wanting also to punish his enemies , he threw his leadership away . Yet his belief in his own destiny never faltered . During the past year he has defied the President of the United States by calling the captive coal miners on strike ? and he won ; he has sulked in the great hall of the United Mine Workers ' building ? once the Washington Yale Club ? accused of failing to speak out wholeheartedly for the war effort ; and he has intensified his relentless fight on old comrades of the CIO while failing to make peace with his more ancient foes of the AF of L. Now he has launched a last desperate campaign ? and he is admittedly at his most dangerous when cornered and alone . II A few years ago Lewis was pictured as a Saul of Tarsus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's he had been the conservative , old-line labor politician who differed from his fellows only in greater ruthlessness and flamboyancy . Then , with the advent of the CIO , he became a messiah leading the underprivileged to salvation . Lewis himself scoffed at any suggestion of conversion , maintaining that he had prepared himself for the new role from that day when , a freckled , redheaded boy of twelve ( with the years his hair has darkened to auburn and then grayed , but his eyerows are red still ) he went to work in a al /nine at his home town of Lucas , On many an occasion , while Iowa . gathered with his new-found liberal Friends round the well-laden board ( he is a great trencherman , fond particularly of pig 's knuckles ) or in the firelit library , he recited the story . It was a fine tale , well told , and each piece fell perfectly into its place . Only a few skeptical listeners inclined to the opinion that he bad made it up . if Lewis was misjudged by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To a large part of the public he is a glower- g , selfish man whose quenchless thirst for power has brought about numberless strikes and riots and who , at the expense of impecunious toilers , rides about in a twelve-cylindered Cadillac driven by a liveried chauffeur . The wide mouth in the boulder-like face seems never to have smiled . If he speaks well of a man it is forgotten . This is due partly to the scarcity and mildness of his praise , but more to his truly extraordinary powers of vituperation . He is extravagant in Shakespearean quotation . This he used on William Green : " Let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp , and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee . " On another occasion , referring to Green , Lewis spoke of " droolings from the pallid lips of a traitor . " Enemies found themselves thrown out of conventions after his request to the delegates that " you now remove their carcasses without the door . " Ex-Vice-President Garner became " a poker-playing , whiskey-drinking , vile old man , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to live for its terminology as well as its inaccuracy . Once he came dangerously near suffering a backfire after either picking a quotation from a compilation or nodding over the actual text . In a formal speech during the captive-mine controversy he directed a quotation from Milton 's " Paradise Lost " at the " sinister " figure of Eugene G. Grace , president of Bethlehem Steel : " When and what art thou , execrable shape , that dar'st , thoughgrim and terrible , advance thy mistreated front athwart my way to yonder gates ? Through them I mean to pass , that be assured , without leave askt of thee . " The next two lines , which he did not quote , " Retire or taste thy folly , and learn by proof , Hell-born , not to contend with Spirits of Heav'n , " may have thrown Lewis off . Actually the speaker who was quoted was Satan , masquerading in false colors . But in private Lewis can be amiable and captivating . The magnetism of his personality fills the room and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad for the platform . Recently he has been a frequenter of Washington 's smart circles , and not long ago the public was treated to a photograph of the lowering bull of the miners seated across a mammoth birthday cake from Alice Roosevelt Long-worth as they jointly celebrated their birthdays , which fell on February 12th . A common hatred of the President is perhaps the immediate cause of the social companionship of Lewis and Princess Alice , but many intimates of both are of the opinion that he is the quicker of the two in conversation . Usually Lewis is mild of manner ; he seldom swears ; a drink or two is his limit , and his perusal of the classics is for pleasure as well as for lumps of garlic with which to flavor his speeches . He claims that the Panchatantra , an ancient Oriental book of beast fables , shaped his life . No one has been quite able to puzzle out the analogy he has hit upon , though there are a number of possibilities . The first two parts of the book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholar to three young men named Fierce Power , Rich Power , and Endless Power , are called " The Winning of Friends " and " The Losing of Friends . " More than most men of large affairs , Lewis is wrapped up in his family . It was not until he was twenty-eight and had married Myrta Bell , a Lucas schoolteacher , that he settled down and looked for advancement in the miners ' union . Mrs. Lewis gave him lessons in " elocudon , " making him declaim from Shakespeare ? a training the results of which are still easily discernible . She advised him in matters of policy and in the judgment of men , and continued to do so when he was bargaining with millionaires and presidents . To-day his thirty-one-yearold daughter Kathryn is his most trusted lieutenant , and ten other relatives are on the payroll of the miners ' union . Fond of domestic life , he erected a brick wall round his handsome colonial house in a fashionable section of Alexandria , Va. , because passers-by stopped to gape at the fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lawn ; and when he takes the dog for a walk in the evening he follows a back path to an old wharf where he sits and spins yarns with the watchman . The public has not been permitted to see this side of Lewis because he does not consider it good policy . When , during his period as hero of the liberals , one of them begged that his publicity staff be permitted to " humanize " him in the manner in which Ivy Lee created a new public character for the late John D. Rockefeller , Sr. , Lewis curtly rejected the suggestion , declaring that the public 's picture of him as a swashbuckling bruiser was helpful . Older associates , considering Lewis a consummate actor , inclined to the theory that he loved his role too well to give it up . They knew that when a cartoon showing him in a particularly menacing attitude appeared he was apt to ask the artist for the original drawing ; and they had , figuratively speaking , seen the old Shakespearean don his robes when newspapermen or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joked with him as he stepped behind the scenes from a convention platform but would not have dared even to nod to him as he made his way up the aisle . In a dining room filled with mine delegates they had seen him sit at a table alone , the problems of the world apparently lying heavy upon his shoulders , and they had known it was a part of his act . Yet if Lewis were no more complicated than this ? a man who in private is his real self , in public the creator of a role ? there would be less internal conflict ahead for the nation . During his messiah period he liked to put his feet on the desk when the day 's work was over and discuss the motives of men . He laughed at the intrigues about him , scoffed at " poor old Billy " Green , ridiculed Washington 's brigades of memo-senders , and often ended by asking of his little court : " What makes me tick , is it power I 'm after , am I a St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were presented . They credited him with grasping for power ? but a degree of power is necessary for the accomplishment of even noble aims . Some ventured that he had too much accustomed himself to think in terms of men rather than ideas . But all agreed that he possessed an analytical and even introspective mind that permitted him to plan and execute each step with a minimum of emotion . They were wrong . His foresight and timing in a given campaign are brilliant , but his vision of the whole is clouded by personal hatreds , a desire to punish no matter what the cost , and a congenital inability to share leadership equally with another . In no other way can his actions of the past two years be explained . III If Lewis were to write a hook setting forth his opinion of President Roosevelt it would require about a day and a half 's dictating time . No pauses for marshaling of thoughts would be required . The story has already been shaped , revised , and polished in his mind , and because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though half a million dollars of mine workers ' money went into the campaign for the President 's re-election in 1936 , Lewis now holds that Roosevelt was always more of a hindrance than a help to labor . The suggestion that the President through the NRA saved the miners ' union enrages Lewis ? though admittedly in 1933 the organization was broke and membership had dropped from 400,000 to 150,000 since he assumed leadership in 1919 . Lewis 's answer is that he wrote labor 's protective section 7a , put it through Congress against the President 's wishes , and single-handedly obtained its enforcement while he conducted the organizational drive which brought back the membership and replenished the treasury . In all subsequent controversies between capital and labor , Lewis declares , the President equivocated . Yet Lewis has taken half a measure and less from many a man and remained on friendly terms with him . Some hold that the Lewis family ? and the views of his wife and daughter play a large part in his decisions ? believes that it was given an inferior place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been heard to deny almost too vigorously that jealousy of the Roosevelts played any part in the difference . Others declare that the President helped the CIO because he wanted to see labor 's influence increase , and then thwarted Lewis 's grasp for more power . They know that Lewis feels he could have destroyed the AF of L leaders and emerged as head of a united labor movement ? on his way to the Presidency of the United States ? except for Roosevelt 's behind-the-scenes maneuvers . His assumption is not entirely without basis . Whatever the cause of the feud , it is certain that Lewis 's conduct of the past few years has been shaped by his effort to humble the President . The struggle developed on all fronts . Lewis charged that the New Deal 's domestic policy had failed miserably , and spoke of " 53,000,000 shrunken bellies " ? the owners of which could easily elect a President . As the fight over foreign policy developed he placed himself squarely opposite Roosevelt . The result was friction inside the CIO itself , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CIO had opened headquarters in Washington the largest office had been set aside for Lewis , and , though preferring his stately offices in theminers ' building , he had appeared several times a week , stalking through the corridors in his public , or grand , manner . But by late 1939 he was not appearing at all and his office was divided into spaces for others . He was already beginning to seclude himself , to see himself in a death struggle with the President . The initial stages of the conflict had brought him closer to the Communists . In the 1920 's he had inserted a clause in the mine workers ' constitution barring Communists from membership and he interpreted the clause to include anyone who seriously disagreed with him . But in the CIO , finding the Communists useful in the difficult and often dangerous organizational jobs , he accepted them while steadfastly denying their presence . A well-known Hearst political writer frequently visited Lewis 's luncheon table in Washington 's celebrity-frequented Occidental restaurant and after a diversity of preliminary small talk always ended : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 've never given me a bum steer ? just how many Communists arc there in the CIO ? " Lewis 's reply never varied . He laid his knife and fork carefully on the edge of his plate , cocked his head in an attitude of thought , and inquired of whatever CIO leader happened to be dining with him : " If we were to search the organization with a fine-tooth comb would we find a single Red ? " Lewis now proposes to save the farmers from the Communists , but he made it his business to know who and where they were , and until their quick shift following Hitler 's attack on Russia he co-operated with them in every CIO assembly to defeat resolutions favoring the President 's foreign policy . The hunter , he had always said , would control the dogs , and this theory he applied to other associates than Communists . His experience in labor 's hierarchy ? he was never elected to an important post until after he became president of the miners ' union ? led him to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic interests . That principle had proved itself in the creation of his own smooth-working miners ' machine , and he followed it in making gifts of miners ' money to new CIO unions . Once when he was fearful that R. J. Thomas , president of the United Automobile Workers , was becoming too independent he said to a member of his inner circle : " This morning I gave that fellow 's union $40,000 , put it right in his hand myself ; that ought to keep him in line . " Later when he set out to vilify Thomas he could think of no harsher term than " ingrate . " Allied with the Communists in the CIO , he made a gesture to the left wing outside of it by proposing a farmer-labor party , then marched across the street and sat down at the council table of the Right . At the Philadelphia convention of the Republican party he exonerated Herbert Hoover of blame for the depression and implied that had he remained in office the country would have recovered more rapidly . ( He explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan partner , had told him Hoover would be nominated after a Taft-Dewey deadlock and he was trying to get in on the ground floor . ) During the first months following the conventions he conducted a campaign through third parties to bring officials of CIO unions into Wendell Wilikie 's camp , but without success , and his determination to defeat Roosevelt grew in proportion . Men who brought reports that the miners were solidly for the President went away under accusation of disloyalty . When E. L. Oliver , executive vice president of Labor 's Nonpartisan League , the CIO 's political arm , issued a statement favoring Roosevelt , Lewis in a towering rage stormed into his office and demanded his keys . Finally he threw his position as head of the CIO into the balance , offering should Willkie be defeated to " accept the result as being the equivalent of a vote of no confidence " and to retire . On the radio he said that he spoke as a private citizen . But the other CIO leaders knew otherwise because shortlyafter the broadcast he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against him . For the first time he met real opposition from men he considered his own , and he was not capable of accepting it . When later he drove Philip Murray , his trusted lieutenant of twenty years , from the vice-presidency of the miners ' union , Lewis spoke of him as a " former friend . " But the term was inexact . As boss Lewis had no friends ; even Murray had never been treated as a friend and comrade-in-arms . It was essential that Lewis retire as CIO president in order to keep his promise , but had he been willing to hold his peace ? and even for his present purposes it would have been cleverer to have done so the convention the following year would have drafted him . Perhaps he intended to . At a testimonial dinner for Murray , his successor , he raised his right hand and swore to stand with Murray when he was right and when he was wrong . But it was not in his makeup to see a former aide ina higher place than his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his punitive campaign on the day after that testimonial dinner . IV In his new bid for power Lewis is not depending entirely on his farm campaign . He has also the celebrated District 50 . District 50 is a huge catchall appendage of the miners ' union and was originally set up to organize workers in industries which use the by-products of coal . This subsidiary is run by Ora Gasaway , its president , who is an old Lewis wheel horse and who for years was an official of the United Mine Workers . Gasaway says that " by-products of coal " can be stretched to include anything animal , vegetable , or mineral . Dairymen are included in District 50 because , according to the Lewis interpreters , the casein of milk is used , as well as coal , in the manufacture of plastics ! Lewis has been making other moves . Raids have been made on unions in the transportation and construction fields under the direction of Lewis 's obstreperous younger brother Denny ( " Me Too " ) Lewis . Energetic attempts have been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AF of L , and Murray , an old official of the miners ' union , has been thrown out of the United Mine Workers . But these maneuvers are of small account compared with the present campaign to organize the farmers . It is quite possible that Lewis 's whole future depends on the outcome . Urban people may be startled to learn that the great national farm organizations are afraid of Lewis . They are afraid , however , and the reason is that their hold on their own membership is tenuous . The big groups are the Farm Bureau , the Farmers Union , and the Grange . The Farm Bureau was organized in the early ' twenties when demands for farm relief were getting vociferous . It was thought that the " solid " and the " responsible " farmers ought to be organized as a check on the firebrands . Contributions were made by farm machinery manufacturers , the great grain companies , and others , and the Farm Bureau was set up under the direct patronage of a Republican Administration . It was tied very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure , the Farm Bureau depends on the Department of Agriculture for its existence down to this day . In many instances the County Agent and the Farm Bureau representative are one and the same man . Much of the work of the farm demonstrators and of the 4H clubs ? these are composed of boys and girls of school age ? is shared between the Department and the Farm Bureau . For years it was impossible to tell which was the tail and which the dog . But recently the Farm Bureau leaders , many of them conservative Southern planters , have broken with the Administration because the Farm Security Administration has been helping the low-income farmers . Now there is a moveto take away the support of the Department of Agriculture , a heavy blow for the Bureau . This move would help the Farmers Union , which has a New Deal economic philosophy , and it may help the Grange , though the vitality of the Grange has dwindled away in the passing of time and it shows its old-time vitality only in the Far West . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Lewis lies in the fact that they can not offer the farmer much in the way of direct money benefit , and Lewis can . The big groups save the farmer a little money through co-operatives , but that 's about all . They send out printed matter , they conduct meetings and send speakers around the country . They carry some weight in Congress , but their direct bargaining power over the price the farmer receives is nil . Lewis is in a position to make some real promises . At one time or another in the past Lewis had contemplated a farm alliance . It was clear that a partnership between the nation 's 6,200,000 farmers and the CIO could dominate the country . Furthermore , since he had come from Iowa , Lewis fancied that he understood farmers and the way they felt about things . Some years ago , however , when Harry Bridges asked him to charter agricultural workers in the hope that they might provide a balance of power in the struggle with the AF of L on the Coast , Lewis agreed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers who possess real political strength . ( In his present farm drive any interest in wages and hours of hired help is sharply disclaimed . ) On a number of occasions Lewis met with agricultural leaders and once he offered practical aid to the Farmers Union and to progressive State groups of the Farm Bureau . But the leaders drew back in alarm when Lewis spoke with contempt of the co-operatives , the foundations of their organization . His position was that farmers could be organized into a sort of mammoth trade union which would bargain with the big processors and distributors on prices , exactly as working men bargain for wages . Now , at last , Lewis has begun to move and the farm-organization men are panic-stricken . The first move came last year in a dairymen 's strike in the Flint , Michigan , milk shed . When auto workers , who had taken up residence on land outside the city limits , went on the picket line , it occurred to the farmers that affiliation with the CIO would help . The auto workers could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over with her father ? could n't the farmers be used in the total war which he was planning ? The result was that Kathryn , who is secretary-treasurer of District 50 , was placed in direct charge of the campaign . Kathryn Lewis is believed to have more influence with her father than anyone except , perhaps , Mrs. Lewis . After her graduation from Bryn Mawr Kathryn served as her father 's secretary , and she was put in charge of District 50 not long ago when a loyal hand was needed to purge the new organization of dissidents . Large like her father , but soft-spoken , Kathryn bosses the District from Washington . She believes the farm campaign to be as big as the original CIO drive ; if she can direct it successfully she sees herself playing a major role in defeating the family 's enemies . And she is as intense a hater as her father ever was . A charter was issued to the Flint dairymen , and Ralph Marlatt , a District 50 representative , was sent out on a nation-wide trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the country are the wrecks and the remnants of regional farm organizations . Some of them still have life in them . Lewis 's men picked up odds and ends here and there ? what 's left of the Wisconsin Cooperative Milk Pool which conducted several strikes some years ago may prove of value ? but the biggest catch was the New York Dairy Farmers Union . The Union 's strike in the summer of 1939 had cut off New York City 's milk supply MAGAZINE and , though the 1941 stoppage was less successful , the Union retained a paid-up membership of about ten per cent of the shed 's dairy farmers and had the support ? at least in hard times ? of a majority . The leaders were capable and honest , but , like all the others before them , they could n't solve the problem of holding together a militant organization . The history of the fighting farm groups ? the Farmers ' Alliance of the ' 90 's , the Non-Partisan League , and the Farmers ' Holiday of the 1930 's are examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance between farms , which makes the collection of dues and co-ordinated action extremely difficult , and because these organizations never were able really to come to grips with the big processors , all of the farm crusades have collapsed . But Lewis brought with him a completely different sort of tactic and a new sort of organization . Lewis undertook to take over the financial burdens of the Dairy Farmers Union ( he changed the name to United Dairy Farmers ) while granting the union complete autonomy . At the same time members were asked to sign a pledge making District 50 its bargaining agent " in all matters pertaining to the price of my milk and condition of its sale . " The Lord hath given , the Lord hath taken away ! Once organized , Lewis expects to keep the United Dairy Farmers going by the trade-union method of checking off dues . The farmer brings his milk to either a co-operative or a plant owned by one of the dealers . The plant managers would be asked to check off dues in the same way the mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they would be requested to do it for every farmer whether he was willing or not . To influence recalcitrant managers Lewis may use boycotts , with member-milk trucked to competitors for a time , or he may tie up the plant with a local strike . Other and more nightmarish methods , such as pollution of milk shipments with kerosene , are predicted by opponents . If successful on a wide enough scale ? and he may be able to win with a minority of the farmers as actual members ? Lewis will demand price contracts with the big distributors under threat of strike . This is the individual dairyman 's hope for a higher price . Because milk prices drop with the greater supply in summer , and drought with resultant high feed prices often occurs , a try for a quick decision in the New York shed may be made in late summer or early fall . If successful in fitting the trade-union key to the milk industry , Lewis would be certain to expand in other directions . Though the machinery would be more complicated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other crops with their processors is entirely feasible . It was the aim of striking farmers in 1932-33 to raise prices by cutting down the flow of produce to market , and they had some success . A closely knit organization under the direction of seasoned strike leaders might tie up the great Chicago meat packing plants , particularly if the packing-house workers co-operated ? though here old wounds might hurt Lewis , for the unions are CIO . The same principle holds for processors of all kinds . Other grievances might be adjusted . For example , in 1932-33 farmers scaled down mortgage debts many millions of dollars by resorting to a curious " strike " which consisted of bidding in chattels and land for a few pennies under threat of dealing harshly with higher bidders . It is no wonder that leaders of the national farm groups are alarmed . They denounce Lewis and issue thunderingstatements , but none is very strong and they are seldom in agreement with one another . They know that if Lewis is able to get results , if he can show important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done for . No one familiar with Lewis 's career is in a hurry to make predictions . The opportunity to organize the farmers is wide open ? but can he do it ? The odds seem overwhelmingly against him . With the CIO ? or better yet a united labor movement ? on his side he would be in a fair position to undertake the terrific task of unionizing agriculture . A few years ago he might have had assistance from some of the groups in the Administration . Instead , now he will have opposition on every hand . He will be denounced as obstructing the war effort ; the hand of the Administration will work against him wherever possible . Lewis 's enemies ? especially the men he himself developed in the CIO ? are mostly young , energetic , and as vindictive as himself , while he must largely depend on old retainers who after a thousand battles would prefer to live out their years in peace . The man is sixty-two years old , he has his daughter and his wife , he has some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when setting out to fight alone . " Let there be no moaning at the bar when I put out to sea , " he told the reporters as he took the sleeper for Flint at the time of the sit-down strikes . It may be that he has the cunning and the strength to win one more victory still . If he loses , he is through .
