txt The police and License Commissioner Paul Moss invaded the theatrical district yesterday in the first step of what may be an official campaign against indecency in the legitimate theatres of dimmed-out Brow/way . First to feel the effects of the drive was " Wine , Women and Song " at the Ambassador Theatre . Plainsclothesmen served summonses charging that the , show , which stars Margie Hart , burlesque strip teaser , and Jimmy Savo , comedian , violates the penal law ohibiting indecency on the stage . Broadway was agog with rumors last night that other shows also would be haled into court on similar charges . Mr. Moss , however , would not comment upon this possibility .. On Sunday Archbishop Spellman , speaking to 3,000 members of the Police Department Anchor Club at St. Patrick 's Cathedral , assailed some of the theatrical offerings on Broadway without naming them . The Catholic Theatre Movement , in the current issue of The Catholic News , lists five shows as " wholly objectionable . " Among them was " Wine , Women and Song . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West Side Court , were served on L H. Herk , former manager of the closed Gaiety burlesque theatre and cosponsor with Lee Shubert and Max Liebman of " Wine , Women and Song " ; Samuel Furst , company manager , and Herman Shapiro , stage manager . None of the per- formers in the show were served and yesterday 's matinee and evening performances proceeded on schedule . A closing notice had been posted backstage on Sunday because of the poor business the show did last week . This show , which opened on Tuesday evening , Sept. 29 , to unanimously adverse notices , is the first show housed in a Broadway legitimate theatre to meet with official displeasure since the police raided " Pleasure Man " in 1928 and arrested members of the cast , including Mae West . Takes Ernst at His Word The only comment Mr. Moss would make was : " It 's true we have served summonses and are taking these men to court . Morris Ernst , who was Herk 's attorney at the time we closed the Gaiety Theatre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can say that we are now going to court . " District Attorney Frank S. Hogan announced last night that he had assigned Assistant District Attorney Lawrence J. to represent the city in the hearing . It was learned that Mr. Ernst probably would not represent Mr. Herk . The Ambassador Theatre is controlled by the Shubert interests . When Mayor La Guardia and Mr. Moss proceeded against the burlesque houses  --  the Gaiety , Eltinge and others  --  the procedure was to refuse renewal of theatre licenses , a power vested in the License Commissioner . The other shows marked " wholly objectionable " by the Catholic Theatre Movement are " By Jupiter , " at the Shubert Theatre , starring Ray Bolger ; " Star and Garter , " Michael Todd 's " revue " starring Gypsy Rose Lee , strip tease artist , and Bobby Clark , at the Music Box ; " Strip for Action , " a comedy based on behind the scenes life in a burlesque theatre , by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse , at the National , and " Native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Wright drama , at the Majestic . Title Misleading , Mayor Says Mayor La Guardia had little to say about the matter . When asked to comment on the issuing of the summonses on the operators of " Wine , Women and Song , " he merely said : " The title is very misleading . The public thought it was Viennese music . " The summonses specifically charge that the show violates Section 1140-A of the Penal Law , which prohibits obscenity and in , decency on the stage . The show . is frankly patterned on the burlesque shows driven from Fortysecond Street and Broadway by Mayor La Guardia and Mr. Moss last Winter and Spring . First of the " carriage trade " burlesque shows to be shown in a legitimate theatre since the closings of the burlesque houses was " Star and Garter , " which Mr. Todd brought to the Music Box on June 24 . With tickets priced at a $4.40 top , it has been selling out since it opened . " Wine , Women and Song " is offered at a $1.65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the producers decided to close next Saturday . At least they posted a notice to that effect , but under union rules this notice may be withdrawn by tomorrow if business should warrant . At curtain time last night no summonses had been served on any other shows .
