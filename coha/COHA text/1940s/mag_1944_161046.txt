Seven out of every too veterans will want some kind of education . That prediction was made last week by Utah 's Senator Elbert Thomas at the 25th birthday party of Manhattan 's New School for Social Research ( TIME , Oct. 4 ) . One problem : many veterans have already had some higher education but , unless special plans are made for them , will be unable to go on to a degree . The New School announced one kind of help : a senior college in which veterans , with underclass credits , can get A.B.s through evening courses. * <P> <P> *Some 400,000 studious U.S. fighting men may seek postwar underclass credits for correspondence and self-teaching courses of the U.S. Armed Forces Institute ( TIME , Feb. 21 ) . Typical of the Institute 's daily ton of letters was that of Brooklyn-born Ensign Frank William Gardner , whose new PC boat is one of the first two U.S. warships with Negro crews . Wrote he : " They are aware . . . that the spotlight . . . shines directly on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in the Institute and the opportunities for correspondence courses , high-school . . . and college credit . . . .
