International Relations Firsthand <P> Sirs : <P> . . . Having been in the Air Corps for almost three years , and overseas ( Southwest Pacific ) for twelve months , I can corroborate the statement made by one of your readers when he said that this is a " thinking " army ( TIME , Aug. 9 ) . ... Our men are scattered throughout the world , and are learning what is meant by " international relations " firsthand . . . . <P> As for the Russians , our men seem to look upon them as supersoldiers , and men striving for what they consider an ideal form of government for their particular domestic situation . They also realize that Russia will be a leader in economic and technical progress in the postwar world . Their attitude is not that we should fear Russia ( as advocated by some ) , but that we should improve our relations and cooperate with them . . . and Britain for a war-free world of the future . <P> The average American boy was unusually naive concerning politics-before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little . The noise of H.E . shells exploding a few yards from him has awakened him from political lethargy . After we have won this war , nine million American boys are going to crawl out of their last slit trench and cast nine million intelligent votes . . . for strong fearless statesmanship . . . . <P> * <P> Rantoul , Ill . <P> Holmes Apocryph <P> Sirs : <P> Admirers of Sherlock Holmes in general and his devotees in the Baker Street Irregulars in particular will resent the caption under the head of " Politics " ( TIME , Aug. 9 ) . <P> Never , in all of the years of their relationship , did the Master use those profane words " Quick , Watson , the needle ! " to his Boswell . His addiction to drugs was an early and passing phenomenon , inspired by boredom and abandoned in the maturity of his years . . . . But even in the days when the needle lay beside the gasogene and tantalus , Holmes did not stoop to call for it in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the canons that this apocryph be expurgated . <P> EDGAR W. SMITH <P> New York City <P> &gt; For this heinous offense to the shades of Holmes+ the writer ( who turned out to be Professor Moriarty ) was fired . He made a successful escape from the office , jumped in a passing hansom cab , and rumbled off over the wet cobblestones into the fog. - ED . <P> Terry Allen Tale <P> Sirs :
