txt WASHINGTON , July 14 ? Treason indictments under which the penalty may be death will be sought against all the fourteen New York and Chicago men and women who aided the eight Nazi saboteurs now on trial here , it was implied today . Department of Justice officials said that the four German aliens in the confederate group could be prosecuted for treason as well as the nine naturalized citizens and one native-born to whom this charge obviously would apply . Such conclusions were based on rulings of the Supreme Court , one laid down in 1873 and the other 122 years ago . Absolute decision that treason would be used as the prosecution instrument had not been reached at nightfall , pending conferences between Wendell Berge , assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division , and the United States attorneys in New York and Chicago , but indications were to that end . In any event , it is certain // DEATH FOR TREASON FACES NAZI AIDES // that the fourteen will be tried in the civil courts . Meanwhile the military commission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer than usual that much of the evidence thus far had been of a military nature , disclosure of which would damage the national interest . Prosecution exhibits , it was said , included explosives , shovels and documents connected with the invaders . The trial , it was declared , would continue for several more days . Demands for the death penalty for the fourteen arrested in New York and Chicago began to reach Washington within twenty-four hours of the announcement of their apprehension . Letters and telegrams insisted that they must pay this priceoalong with the eight principals . Messages urging shooting or hanging for the men who landed on Long Island and in Florida from the U-boats continue in an ever- , increasing volume . Some of these communications determinedly say that any other result would be al rank miscarriage of justice and would further seriously damage the morale of the American people now massed behind the war drive . Pleas for leniency are few and far between . Almost every letter and telegram reaching the White House and War and Justice Departments is strong in language and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-citizens in the aiding group , whom officials say could be punished for treason , are Helmut Leiner of Astoria , L. I. , who came here in 1929 ; Mrs. Maria Kerling of New York City , who arrived in 1926 , and Mr. and Mrs. Harry Jaques of Chicago , who reached these shores respectively in 1924 and 1925 . U. S. Code on Death Sentence Argument that this sentence could be asked was based on the case of Carlisle vs. the United States , decided by the Supreme Court in 1873 and which the United States code summarizes as : " An alien while domiciled in the United States owes a local and temporary allegiance , which continues during the period of his residence , and he is amenable to the laws of the United States prescribing punishment for treason and for giving aid and comfort to rebellion . " The other Supreme Court case , United States vs . Wiltberger decided in 1820 held , said the Code , that " treason is a breach of allegiance and can be committed by him who owes allegiance either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was owed by aliens who came here seeking refuge or for other reasons . The ten other persons obviously could be charged with treason , as they are citizens . They are the native-born Mies Hedwig Engemann , and the naturalized Anthony Cramer , both of New York City ; Ernest Herman Kershof and Herman Heinrich Faje both of New York City ; and the naturalized Mr. and Mrs. Hans Max Haupt , Mr. and Mrs. Otto Richard Wergin , and Mr. and Mrs. Walter Wilhelm Froehling , Chicago residents . Should the Department of Justice not prefer charges of treason against the aliens they could be tried for espionage , for which death also may be the sentence . Mr. Berge talked here on the prosecutions with J. Albert Woll , United States Attorney at Chicago , and consulted by telegraph with Matthias Correa and Harold Kennedy , similar Federal officers in New York City and Brooklyn . Court Room Communiqu ? The communiqu ? , sent from the Military Commission court room by Major Gen. Frank R. McCoy , describing the progress of the trial read : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The government continued the presentation of its case by the examination of certain FBI agents . " Thus far in the proceedings a large number of prosecution exhibits , including explosives , clothing , shovels and documents have been identified and introduced in evidence . " There has been presented to the commission and accepted in evidence much information of a military nature , the disclosure of which at this time would not be in the interests of the United States . " The defense has been permitted fully courts . " The trial is expected to continue for several more days . " The commission adjourned for the day at 4:30 P. M. and will reconvene at 10 A. M. tomorrow . " A previous forenoon communiqu ? said : " The commission convened at 10 A. M. " Most of the morning was taken up with the reading of documents . " The commission adjourned at 12:30 P. M. It will convene at 1:30 P. M. and sit without regard to hours . " Attorney General Biddle has written to Chairman Van Nuys of the Senate Judiciary Committee saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Honor to J. Edgar Hoover , head of the FBI , " is particularly gratifying to me and I am sure to Mr. Hoover 's associates . " The medal would recognize the work of Mr. Hoover in connection with the arrest of the saboteurs.
