 | You 're all tuckered out from a hard day , and you gratefully go to bed with the hope that a good night 's sleep will put you in shape for tomorrow . You close your eyes , and ? nothing happens ! You just lie there . You do n't go to sleep . You do n't - even begin to . " That does it ! " you say to yourself in despair . Because , since childhood , we 've been told , " You must have your sleep . " We 've been filled with awful stories of what might happen to us if we did n't sleep . Science , however , on the basis of many experiments , has developed some different ideas about insomnia . It has found that you can sleep without resting and that you can rest without sleeping , and of the two , the important one is rest . Dr. Maurice Chideckel , in his book Sleep , Your Life 's One-Third , says : " You go to bed to rest your body . Sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychiatrist , wrote that sleep " is not rest , but only part of rest ; an effect of rest , not a cause ; a lesser part , not the whole . " But unless you are fully aware of this , there is a vicious cycle of insomnia ready for you . It goes like this : 1 . In normal , healthy persons , virtually all cases of sleeplessness are caused by the state of mind , generally worry . 2 . After a sleepless night , most people start to worry about sleep . 3 . The new worry , about not sleeping , keeps them awake . 4 . Result : Insomnia . When the psychiatrist discovers you have started on this cycle , he teaches you to throw it in reverse , stating it like this : " If you ca n't sleep , do n't worry , and if you do n't worry , you can sleep . " The ideal , of course , is to avoid even that first sleepless night . So do n't be too quick to jump to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just because you lie awake longer than usual with your mind racing at daytime speed . Other factors can delay slumber . Extreme physical fatigue is one . It 's painful and pain tends to keep you awake . For such cases . coffee is recommended ! ( It says so in Dr. Edmund Jacobson 's book , You Can Sleep Well . ) Coffee may give you enough of a lift from painful fatigue to boost you into slumberland . Menstruation may keep a woman awake longer than usual , experiments show , and it increases the tendency to dream . But that need not bother her . The same experiments indicate that it does not interfere with rest or the length of time she is able to sleep . It 's hardest to go to sleep in summer , easiest in spring , but we rest most in summer and least in winter , even though we sleep longer in the winter , according to experiments at the University of Chicago . If you 're just too hot for comfort , try as a pillow a hot-water bottle filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You ? can buy ear stoppers for sleeping through noise . An improper bed , or unaccustomed light , or too few , too many , or too heavy covers make for sleeplessness . So . You 've heard the clock strike twice , and the bed 's all right and so are all the other things . You 're just worried about something , and you know it . What then ? What can you do ? Ways have been developed by others , and maybe one of them will work for you . Laird and Muller , the Colgate University sleep researchers , in their book on sleep , recommend a little perfume or synthetic aromatics on the pillow , or even moth balls , to encourage deeper , slower breathing , as in normal sleep , and to take your mind off worry . An editor I know claims he has an infallible device for seducing his worrisome mind into sleep . When he anticipates a sleepless night , he tells his wife to phone his office in the morning that he will be late . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he almost immediately falls asleep and usually is awake in time to tell his wife not to phone ? a nice system if you have that kind of job . Almost all authorities condemn the traditional sheep counting . Dr. R. D. Gillespie , an eminent London sleep researcher , says that such " mental gymnastics are merely tricks that  | actually lead away from rather than toward sleep . " Let us say that you tried all the systems and you still " did n't sleep a wink " all night . Are you sure you did n't ? Doctors know that a healthy mind plays tricks that way . Experiments invariably indicate that a " sleepless " person is n't , at least not to the extent he believes . But your brain , struggling to keep you awake , wo n't admit the little lapses of sleep it yields to during the night . Anyway , the fact remains that you were awake a large part of the night . Here it is the next day and you 've got to be on your toes and looking fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity . Dr. Nathaniel Kleitman , an authority on sleep , kept some human guinea pigs awake from 40 to 115 hours and then found and that " drowsiness could be dispelled by any form of muscular activity . " Furthermore , while active , his subjects looked as lively and awake as anyone with a good night 's sleep . " This was true , however , only if the subject engaged in some kind of activity . When he sat down , one could see that the was extremely sleepy . " If you can lie down during the day after one of your sleepless nights , go ahead . Do n't be afraid a nap will interfere with the next night 's sleep . Experiments by Dr. Kleitman revealed that the average person sleeps only five minutes fewer the night after a daytime nap , regardless of the length of the nap . Dr. Gillespie says : " There is no foundation for the fear that an afternoon nap will prevent sleeping readily at night . On the contrary , it is beneficial , teaches relaxation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or no nap , you fearfully approach - the second night of threatened sleeplessness , wondering if this is going to be another one . In preparation for it , you should spend a quiet evening . Excitement is a poor prelude to bedtime , and that goes for interesting social activities or absorbing work . Be bored ; it 's a wonderful opiate . Have a late snack if you wish . Animals , falling asleep after meals , prove that eating does n't interfere with sleeping . And Laird 's tests on 297 persons showed that they went to sleep quicker and slept more heavily after a light dairy snack . Large dinners and liquids may cause dreams , but not necessarily unpleasant dreams , and dreaming does n't necessarily connote bad sleep . If the neighbors are noisy , move your bed away from the wall ? the wall is a sound conductor . If the sheets are icy , grit your teeth and climb in anyway . The cold sheets and shivering will draw the blood to the surface , away from the brain , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you lie ? It does n't matter . There used to be a lot of advice ? such as , do n't sleep on your left side , because it taxes the heart , and do n't double up , because it strains the muscles . Even our Army 's medical bulletins used to caution soldiers not to " curl up and buckle in the middle . " But doctors know now that whatever position you assume , you wo n't keep it long , asleep or awake , so it 's of no significance .  | As much as possible , relax . Aside from sleeping , that 's important for rest . Check up on yourself to be sure you 're relaxing ? no frown , no clenched fists , no limb supporting its own weight . Make sure your eyes are n't clamped shut . Better to leave them open . Here you are , then , all scientificall prepared for sleep . The next thing to do is to forget the whole object . Because what you 've really done is prepare your body and your nerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require . You'll. sleep as much as you need to , and if you do n't sleep , the chances are that you just do n't require ii . What you do need are . must have is rest . That you can give yourself . Let your thoughts wander . Perhaps you 'd like some interesting things t think about in connection with bedtime habits . A survey by the John B. Pierce Foundation supplies some odd facts : Men average 7 1/3 hours ' sleep in 24 their wives , 7 3/4 . Twenty-two percent of women use heating pads in bed . Most women start to sleep on their stomach . Thirty-five percent - of them spurn . slippers and run around barefoot at bedtime . Most sleep in nightgowns . Most wives undress in front of their husbands . Twenty percent of them lock the bathroom door , and of this 20 percent the majority keep it locked whether or nothere is anyone else in the house . Only a little more than half the people surveyed reported they fell asleep immediately . About one-fourth of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie quiet and relaxed while wakeful thoughts whirl around in you . head , you still may be getting more real rest than if you were asleep , for the average sleeper is restless . Scientific tests . with machines that measure every movement of the body , reveal that the average sleeper moves 10 to 12 times an hour and completely changes his position 20 to 45 times a night . The average rest period during 8 hours ' sleep is only 111k minutes . One experimenter kept himsel : awake 80 hours , then went to bed for 40 hours , and the longest period of rest he achieved was 90 minutes during his second night in bed . Even the eyeballs may move in sleep . Nor is the body completely relaxed . Stresses and strains are placed on various muscles throughout the night There you have the difference between rest and sleep . Dr. Riggs considered that " sleep is of small relative importance . " But suppose you went on night after night without sleeping . Dr. Louis J. Karnosh , an authority , doubts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kleitman says , " No one can commit suicide by refusing to fall asleep . " What about stories of people 's losing their minds as a result of insomnia ? Dr Gillespie says , " I have yet to see a patient whose mental disorders could be fairly attributed to insomnia . " Dr. Riggs ' comment on this popular belief is , " Sheer nonsense . " Then what would happen ? The best authorities agree that " the reflex will break through in any case " In other words , you will go on without sleeping until you fall asleep ! It 's inevitable .
