WAR leaves a variety of scars . One of the scars it leaves is dreams . The war is over now and in waking life it seems like something that happened in a distant and slightly larger age , and most of the dreams I used to have about bombing and shell  --  ing and machine-gun fire no longer recur . But a dream about being trapped in a town that is being surrounded by Japanese troops , and not being able to escape from a building there because the elevators are full of war correspondents , keeps coming back , and a dream about two men in farmers ' clothes who stood next to a wrecked German vehicle on a doubtful road near Arpajon and stared churlishly at a companion and myself as we went past in a jeep . Somehow , by the time we had reached the next bend in the road , I was certain those two men were German soldiers who , like many others , had dressed in civilian clothes in an attempt to get through our loosely defined lines during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join a column that was coming down from the north , and we did n't turn back to question them , and from time to time my conscience , paying me off for allow  --  ing two Germans to wander unmolested behind our lines , makes me dream that I am on that road again and firing at the Germans , frantically and ineffectu  --  ally , because , although they are very close to me and standing still , smiling at me scornfully , alI the bullets curve erratically to one side or go so slowly that they merely drop harmlessly off the ragged blue disguise of the enemy . And then there is the dream in which I shoot the three priests in Mont-Saint-Michel . Morer-SAINT-MICHEL rears up , Gothic and archaic , on its island , beset by tides , in the shallow bay of Avranches , off the coast of Brittany . In the middle days of the summer of 1944 , when our forces were branching east toward Paris and speeding across the Brest peninsula , Mont-Saint-Michel , along with a great deal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less by default , by the cut-off enemy At the crossroads at Pontorson , where the roads from Mont-Saint-Michel , Rennes , and Saint-Male meet , a single German trou  --  ser leg , still miraculously tucked into its boot , hung from a telephone wire twen  --  ty feet high , witness of the fury of some earlier bombing . Under it marched , in the usual strung-out files on both sides of the road , the soldiers of a regiment of the Seventy-ninth Division , following in STUFF OF DREAMS the tracks of an armored division that had swept through the day before . A mile or so up the road , smoke rose straight into the windless sky from a vehicle that had been knocked out by two German planes in a sneak strafing a few minutes before . I was with a small Signal Corps camera team  --  two cam  --  eramen , myself , and a driver  --  in a jeep . The infantrymen , plodding doggedly toward the undefended town of Saint-James , ten miles away , did not promise anything very spectacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go off on our own in the opposite direction toward the coast . Aside from a horse standing stolidly in the middle of the narrow road wait  --  ing to die , with a bullet hole in his belly and a long tube of intestine hanging out of it , there were no signs of war as we slowly drove down through the charm  --  ing seaside landscape . At one farm  --  house an old woman waved to us and called , " Ai wierlersehets , " obviously thinking we were Germans on the way out rather than Americans on the way in . We waved back and continued to  --  ward the sea . The countryside was sunny and untouched , and there was a kind of Sunday hush over it , with the towns quiet , the animals untended in the meadows , and the fields empty of workers . Here and there more ad  --  venturous souls stood silently at the doors of their homes , - waiting for what the war would bring them . We were a little on edge be  --  cause of the unnatural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asking of the farmers along the road , " Oi ; est le Boche ? " This ques  --  tion , spoken very clearly and slowly , was a large part of our tactical equip  --  ment in the riotous days when columns were rac  --  ing through France , leaving a disorderly jum  --  ble of German troops around them . " Four kilometres down the road , " said the first man we spoke to , a large farmer who seemed to be taking the war with a great deal of calm . " You will find them a little to the right . " We thanked him and went on . We asked twice more , and each time we got corroborating answers . " Two kilometres , " a woman with a child in her arms told us , a little way on . " One kilometre , " said a young girl , as we stopped , our carbines ready on our knees . " They are hiding . " Finally we halted at a farmhouse before which an old woman was stand  --  ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her large bosom . " Oh est le Beebe , Marlamer I asked . She pointed up a side road that went past her farm . " Two fields down , Monsieur , " she said . " Ten of them . Kindly go and kill them . " " Why , Madame ? " I asked politely . " Last night they came into my kitchen , " she said furiously , " and at the point of a gun they demanded a litre of butter . And not a sou in payment . Go and kill them . " I thanked her and assured her that they would do her no more harm and would , like thousands of their colleagues surrendering at that moment all over Normandy and Brittany , undoubtedly give up to the first large contingent of American troops to arrive in the neigh  --  borhood . She watched us with dis  --  approval as we drove on across the tidal flats , now sown with mines and apple-wood stakes to foil glider and para  --  chute invasion . Ahead of us , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea on one side and the minefields on the other , stood the fortress Mont-Saint-Michel , built by the faithful , warlike monks of the Benedictine order in the Middle Ages . It looked pretty and unreal , and it looked Disneyish , as did so many of the great buildings of the Old Ihrorld to Americans who had been exposed to the works of the Master Animator . As we drew closer and the pile as  --  sumed its true propor  --  tions in the long rays of the afternoon sun , it lost in prettiness and gained in splendor , and for a moment we must all have felt the incongruity of the shabby little jeep rattling up to the forbidding walls that had looked down upon princes in ar  --  mor and sieges by battering ram and arquebus . THERE were seven or eight jeeps parked outside the town 's gate , with a G.I. on guard , who told us they 30 JANUARY 5 , I 9 4 6 belonged to a cavalry reconnaissance outfit that had just arrived and was at the moment investigating the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans . Inside the gate was collected a small crowd of the inhabi  --  tants , gazing curiously and coldly at two German prisoners sitting in a niche in the inside of the town wall . A French Senegalese , freed several hours before from the prison camp in which the Germans had kept him for four years , was guarding the two captives with a long , obsolete rifle , grinning widely , waving the gun , moving delightedly about in a little dance before the glum faces of the prisoners . They were very young . When I spoke to them , in French , they told me they were not Germans but Czechs . Our French , mine with a Brooklyn accent and theirs , I suppose , from Prague , was not con  --  ducive to a long political discussion , and I did not inquire what two seventeen  --  year-old Czechs were doing in the Ger  --  man Army . At any rate , they had had enough and had hidden so that they could give themselves up in peace . A short , tough-looking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a German burp gun , introduced himself as the leader of the resistance movement in the small town , a movement that could not have numbered more than seven or eight people , and rather formally welcomed us to Mont-Saint  --  Michel . While he was talking to me , a little old woman sidled up and slipped a card into my hand . " English Tea , " it read . " Served from four to six . " " We are open for business today , " she told me in a frightened , hesitant voice . " Just up the street . " The man in the beret shoved her away and drew me to one side . " There are fifty Germans in the next town , " he said . " And they say they desire to fight . I 've tried to tell the other Amer  --  icans , but they do n't speak French and they do n't understand Inc . I myself will act as guide and lead you to them . " I thanked him and went looking for the officer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sit  --  ting , exhausted , at a table in the bar of the nearest hotel , drinking slowly and gloomily from a bottle of Chablis . Their lieutenant , they said without interest , was somewhere up the hill , poking around . I walked up the town 's prin  --  principal street , steep and narrow and lined with cafes , not now open , and souvenir shops selling a large variety of holy and secular knickknacks . A few hundred feet up , I came to the English tearoom . The little , frightened lady was standing in the doorway with a cake platter in her hand . On the platter was a tiny , thin cake . " Sec , " she said , gravely . " We are all prepared for you . " The cake was poor and heavy-looking , made out of the uni  --  versal coarse flour of wartime France , but in brave icing on top of it was a wavery Cross of Lorraine . " I knew you were coming , " the old lady said . From below there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street to sec what was happening . A cavalryman had one of the German prisoners by the throat and was trying to throttle him , shouting hoarsely and angrily at him . The lieutenant came out of a building and pulled the soldier off the frightened Czech . The soldier stood looking an  --  grily at the prisoner for a moment , then wheeled and went down to the gate and out to his jeep . I told the lieutenant what the Frenchman had told me about the fifty Germans in the next town who de  --  sired to fight . The lieutenant was as weary-looking as his men and stared vaguely around at the crowd while I was speaking to him . " Are you going after them ? " I asked . He shrugged . " We 'll see , " he said , and wandered off . " Well ? " the Frenchman in the beret asked me eagerly . " Is there going to be a battle ? " " I do n't know , " I said . The French  --  man looked annoyed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two cameramen  --  Privates Richard Hoar and Kenneth Mar  --  they  --  and I started up the hill toward the church . Most of the inhabitants were prudently staying indoors , and we climbed along narrow , deserted old stone alleys up to the lovely rich stone of the church , which seemed as soft and graceful as worn velvet in the late-afternoon sun . High on a terrace under the main spire , overlooking the broad sweep of the Brittany coast , with the sea deep blue and shimmering far below , there was a little , fenced-in , clapboard shack , with signs in German all around it , and a little , unlocked gate in front of it . This had been a German air-raid warning station , and it was curious to think of what kind of man had sat there for the Nazis , in that high , windswept , religious place , with all that beauty spread serenely around him , and given the warning that the fleets of B- I 7s were approaching the coast across the water from England . About five miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighter planes were slow THE NEW YORKER ly and deliberately straf  --  ing , keeping in a Fer  --  ris-wheel kind of circle , first one , then another gliding down , firing , and pulling up and back and over , and return  --  ing down to continue the job . It was impos  --  sible , so far away , to tell whether they were theirs or ours , and the whole performance had an unreal , circus-like air . There was no sound at that distance , and the sparkling , pret  --  ty movement of the tiny planes in the bright , silent sky made it al  --  most impossible to be  --  lieve that there were men crouched , bloody and cursing , in the brush and ditches be  --  low , dying in the harsh spatter of machine guns . We leaned against a parapet and looked down . There was a hustle of movement around the jeeps at the gate  --  tiny , jerky fig  --  ures getting into the jeeps  --  arid , as we watched , the proces  --  sion of vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road toward the fifty Germans who desired to fight . It was late and the shadows of the squat little machines were very long as they sped away , and somehow , from that antique height , it seemed as though Cecil B. De Mille had invented an afternoon in the fourteenth century and not got it quite right . Hoar and Marthey and I rushed down to the gate , but by the time we got there the jeeps had disappeared . Our driver told us that the lieutenant had suddenly said , " All right , let 's go , " and all the cavalrymen and three or four of the Frenchmen , holding bicycles and clinging to the hoods of the jeeps , plus the Senegalese and his two prisoners , had piled onto the vehicles and gone off . Our driver had called to us , but his voice had n't reached up to us at the top of the hill , and it was too late to follow . WE decided that there was no place else we wanted to go that after  --  noon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay for the night . We drove the jeep up the narrow street , against the warnings of the natives , who swore that never had a car gone that far up the hill in the entire history of Mont-Saint-Michel . The rooms we got were on the fourth floor and overlooked most of the town . They were neat and comfortable and clean , and had been used two nights before by German offi  --  cers , who had left on the walls the in  --  evitable lists and regulations which are the spoor of modern armies . We ate on a terrace overlooking the basin between the town and the main  --  land , and watched the famous tide come in , and I remembered the first time I had read about Mont-Saint-Michel , in high-school French , in a textbook with a pen-and-ink drawing of the fortress and with the difficult words translated at the bottom of the page . I remem  --  bered something about peasants driving across the bed of the hay in two-wheeled carts when the tide was out , and the danger of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered something about a protracted siege long ago , but who had attacked and who had defended , and what the outcome had been , had vanished in the mists of bored French recitations in a crowded classroom in Brooklyn fifteen years be  --  fore . As we ate , congratulating the owner of the hotel on his omelets , we heard from him and his pretty , robust wife some of the occupation history of the town . The Germans had been most correct , except for the S.S. troops and the paratroopers , who had been rough , with a tendency to drunkenness and disrespect for the ladies . Before they left , they had told the inhabitants that if the Allies ever took the town , they , the Germans , would personally make certain it was destroyed . I found that most of the townspeople , deep in their hearts , believed the threat and would not have been surprised if the entire place had suddenly blown up and slipped into the ocean . Some of the officers , however , ac  --  cording to the wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one in par  --  ticular , a studious Austrian who had had something to do with a meteoro  --  logical station , was well liked , gentle , and affable . He had grown to love the place , and when , two days before , he had been ordered to leave , he had bro  --  ken into tears , thrown himself on the floor , and refused , saying he had never liked the German Army , that he loved Mont-Saint-Michel , and that he wished to remain and be taken prisoner by the Americans there . He was carted off by his comrades , in disgrace with them but firmly placed in the sympathies of the townspeople . While we were eating , two Ameri  --  can war correspondents and their driver appeared and ate at the table next to us . They told us they had just arrived and were staying the night at a hotel near the gate . This was a welcome addition to the investing force . It was very fine to have a whole historic fortress town to ourselves , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was another party of Americans somewhere in the vicinity in case of trouble on this first night . I asked the hotel owner about the Fascists and collaborationists in the town , and he said there were three , the most notorious a cafe owner down the street , who had finally come out in his true colors by putting swastikas in icing on his Easter buns in 1943 . The banners of the people of Mont-Saint  --  Michel seemed to come almost exclu  --  sively from the bakery . A pretty girl in a corner kept smiling at our driver , a gallant West Virginian , and to clear the decks for him , Hoar and Marthey and I strolled down to the gate and stood outside it , watching the sea lap at the causeway and talking to a knot of townspeople gathered there . It was dusk by this time , and the little man in the beret had just returned , wearily , on his bicycle . The fifty Germans who had desired to fight , he said , had thought better of it before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found . He had pedalled hack , terribly disap  --  pointed at not being able to kill any Germans that night . He was being gruff with his wife , who was trying to sympathize with him , and he soon re  --  tired tohis home . There were about ten women and children grouped around us Americans by now , and they asked the usual questions : When would the war end ? Did we think we would win ? Did we think the Germans would destroy Mont-Saint  --  Michel now that they had lost it ? Was it true , as they had heard , that every town in Nor  --  mandy was reduced to rubble ? Speaking confident  --  ly , in the name of the American Army , I promised that the war would end soon and that Mont  --  Saint-Michel would not be touched by the Germans . Three of the women in the group had husbands in German pris  --  on camps whom they had n't seen for four years , and they smiled politely but disbelievingly when I said that they would be reunited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a German Army film unit , just like ours , had been to Mont-Saint-Michel and had taken pictures in the church . They had had a little monkey with them that one of the soldiers had picked up in Africa , and they had painted a large red cross on its hack with mercurochrome and turned it loose , as a garish joke , on the steps of the church , chasing it back and forth with shouts and laughter , as they ground their cameras . When they had left , the monkey was still at large . It had dis  --  appeared sometime during the night and no one had seen it since . " The Germans ! " one of the wom  --  en said , shaking her head , as though the affair of the monkey threw a very significant light on the national char  --  acter . The same woman touched the carbine Iwas carrying and asked , " Have you killed many Germans with this ? " The entire group fell silent and listened hopefully for my answer . I foolishly de  --  cided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " none as yet , " and regretted it immediately as I saw the look of disappointment on every face . I could have said , with no harm to anyone , that I had killed six or seven Germans , and made a group of war-worn people who had suffered for four years happy for a moment . Of the many mistakes that I made in the war , some of serious proportions , this wanton moment of rectitude returns to annoy me most often . I was dark by this time , and from A the direction of Avranches we saw the sudden flash of guns . A few sec  --  onds later we heard the rumble of heavy anti-aircraft fire and the explosion of bombs . The sound rolled unimpeded across the flat , shallow bay and started all the windows of the town rattling in the darkness . The entire stone town , set securely on its granite hill , seemed to be transformed into a single , frail , trem  --  bling instrument , giving forth an eerie , bass , rising and falling wail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the summer darkness . " They are coining to destroy us , " said the woman who had asked me whether I had killed any Germans . She took her child in her arms and hurried into the town for shelter . The others scat  --  tered , too , and the two cameramen and I went up the hill to our hotel , with the sound of the trembling win  --  dows filling the air around us . The bombing and the answering fire grew more intense as the planes closed in on the Avranches bridge , over which all our traffic had to pass on its way into Brittany . The sound of breaking glass , tinkling and sharp , mixed with the deep  --  er rumble  --  a nervous , persistent treble melody over the general bass . We went up to a terrace high on the hill , fragrant with the sea and the smell of the flowers in a tiny walled garden near by . We leaned on the battlements and watched the aerial battle in the dark skies above us . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracers , flares , and bomb explosions . He nodded agree  --  ably to us , like a friendly neighbor sitting in the next seat at the theatre . The German planes were using Mont-Saint  --  Michel as a guiding point , flying low over it , their engines very loud and close above our heads , then straightening out for their bomb runs to the coast across the bay . We heard the ragged , wicked sound of machine guns in the sky over us and , looking up , saw the tiny , tearing streaks of tracers , weaving a con  --  fused pattern as night fighters went at the bombers . Suddenly a plane burst into flames , far , far up in the sky . A moment later another plane caught fire , the two of them illuminating the church and the seaaround it in a baleful , flickering glare . One plane fell out of control immediately , dropping from a height of perhaps ten thousand feet , a huge , streaming ball of fire , and crashed , in a final brilliant explosion , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ der control . It grew larger and Larger as it came at us with a furious , blazing deliberation , and it was easy to imagine the pilot fighting at the controls to land on the sand near the town . We watched grimly , without a sound , as the burning mass came closer and closer , until it looked as though it were going to drop directly on us . We were all sure , some  --  how , that it was an enemy plane , and we had been bombed nastily in England all that winter and spring and every night in Normandy and had been strafed in daylight on the roads , and we watched without pity as the pilot finally either jumped or lost control and with a sudden swerve the plane dipped off its course and fell in a long , screaming dive to the sand about two miles away , where it burned brightly for five min  --  utes or so before it died into glowing ashes . We said good night to the priest and went back to the hotel . The streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hurrying up to the church on top of the hill for protection under God 's wing from the bombing they were sure was coming . I was fairly con  --  fident that the hard-pressed Luftwaffe had more profitable targets that night than a sacred relic of the fourteenth century and a concentration of seven Americans , and I started up to my room . On the way through the dimly lit bar , which was alive with the sound of the plate-glass windows as they-throbbed from the concussion of the fighting , I met the lady who had flirted with our driver . I asked where he had gone , and she shrugged and said she did n't know . Then she smiled at me with what seemed in that doubtful light to be an amorous smile and put her arm around my shoulder and leaned over and whispered into my ear . I did n't under  --  stand what she said , and I said , " Encore , suil vow plait , " feeling a little rat  --  tled by this sudden access of French affection . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in  --  viting , " avez-vous du chocolat ? " Gravely I told her that , alas , I had no choc  --  olate , and she removed her arm , shrugged again , picked up the pillows and comforters she had been carrying , and went out into the street , on her way to the church , where she was going tt , spend the night . The driver was snoring gently on his bed , oblivious of the bombing , and Mar-they , Hoar , and I said good night and
