Don Giorgio Vannini , a spry , cheerful young priest , was about the most popular man in the tiny mountain village of Affrico . As assistant to the parish priest , who was old and failing , Don Giorgio climbed tirelessly up &; down the mountainside , ministering to the flock . For the children he organized picnics and games , in which he himself joined . He made a bowling green for the men , and bowled with them . Villagers remembered how , after war 's end , three youths wandered into a German minefield and Don Giorgio walked in boldly to give them help . <P> Affrico lies in the district of Emilia , Italy 's Reddest region , and most of its 500 people voted Communist at the last election . Don Giorgio is a staunch antiCommunist , but the whole village loved him . Last spring , when the old parish priest died , the people of Affrico allowed themselves , after a suitable interlude of grief , to exult over the prospect that Don Giorgio would now become their priest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise , gave the post to one Don Luciano Massa . Don Giorgio sadly left the village . <P> <P> The Affricans composed a blunt letter to Don Luciano : " It is with the greatest sorrow that we learn of your nomination as the parish priest of Affrico . . . " They sent a delegation to him , and another to the Catholic authorities in Bologna . On their weather-beaten , 17th Century church and on the rocky mountain road they put up big signs : " Affrico wants Don Giorgio . . . Don Giorgio , come back to your parish . " Said a burly peasant : " If Don Giorgio does n't come back , the carabinieri had better get themselves a barracks up here . " <P> To guard against a surprise invasion by the unwanted Don Luciano , the Affricans posted sentries on the road , with conch-shell horns and a bell . They barricaded the doors of the church with stones . When the priest of an adjoining parish , fearing that Affrico had gone too long without the sacraments , came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the stones temporarily , but only five people attended . <P> Last week the church of Affrico was still empty , and its doors still walled up . Don Luciano had not appeared . The archbishop , who could not with dignity knuckle under to the rebellious flock , had referred the matter to Rome . The stubborn Affricans were considering an appeal to the Pope . Said one sharecropper , who is nominally a Communist but whose ideological reliability is subject to grave doubts : " Don Giorgio has been good to our children and risked his life for us . In him we have faith . "
