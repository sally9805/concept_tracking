The Government was trying hard last week to dispel the impression that it liked the job of bossing U.S. soft-coal mines . Big , bluff Admiral Ben Moreell , coalmines administrator , was doing all he could to speed the return of the mines to their corporate owners . He begged labor and management to discuss again their chances for reconciliation ; he set up a Supreme Court test case on the biggest issue in conflict , the unionization of foremen-which U.M.W. wants and the companies hate . <P> None of these stabs spurred either worker or owner . Government operation had been creeping up on them for a long time . It started in 1933 with NRA , under which John L. Lewis managed to unionize almost the entire industry . By the time NRA collapsed , the unions were too big to be ignored , so owners teamed up with union leaders to see what they could get from the Government . The outcome was the Guffey Act in 1935 , which set price floors , extended unionization-and also extended the Government 's hand . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court in 1936 , it was succeeded by other regulations which , if anything , made the Government 's role stronger . The war made it dominant . The results to date : in one way or another , the Government has been setting coal prices since 1935 . Because of John Lewis ' annual strikes , it also had to seize and keep full operating control of some or all U.S. soft-coal mines for , roughly , seven months in 1943 , ten months in 1944 , five months in 1945 . <P> Last week it was beginning its fourth month in 1946 as boss of about 2,800 mines ( including 71 hastily added last week after having been lost in the shuffle of Government mailing lists when a general seizure was ordered last May ) . <P> The oddest thing about it all was that outside of the Government , few people seemed to mind . Seeing private enterprise stay in Government hands , miners found the Government a much more liberal boss than their old ones . And many owners , pleased with the booming rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July ) under Government control , were quite content to sit back and watch the profits pile up under Ben Moreell 's management .
