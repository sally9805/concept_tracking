A ROOM ON THE ROUTE ( 327 pp. ) - Godfrey Blunden-Lippincoft ( $3 ) . <P> A Room on the Route is the best novel on Russia since Arthur Koestler 's Darkness at Noon , though Koestler 's book is still much the better . Written by a 40-year-old Australian , A Room on the Route has many qualities of traditional Russian fiction , including some that Russian writers have not recently dared to indulge . No Russian could write so honestly , and so far no Western visitor to Russia during the war has drawn such good fiction from his experience . Blunden was in Moscow for 14 months in 1942-43 as a correspondent for the Sydney Daily Telegraph . <P> " The Route " is the broad Moscow avenue down which the Packard limousines from the Kremlin streak every morning before dawn , carrying commissars and marshals to their country dachas after the night 's work . Everyone who lives on The Route lives under special surveillance by the NKVD ( now the MGB and MVD ) , and the NKVD has cause for suspicion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his merry Russian friend Mitka to a significant little group of people who meet on The Route as conspirators . <P> Rachel Semyonovna fought as a girl in the Civil War of 1917-18 , shared with her husband Ivan the later years of consecrated work for The Party-years she remembers now with bitterness . Ivan was taken in the purge of Old Bolsheviks in 1937 , broken by torture , and later sent to die in an ill-equipped People 's Guard Battalion before the German armored thrust at Moscow . She explains to Ferguson how the Old Bolsheviks , Lenin 's friends , triumphed over Stalin in the first hour of the Moscow Trials . Until the Khozyain ( the Boss ) woke up to what was happening , they stood accused of struggling with him for power , and the very charge was an admission by Stalin that he , the supposedly selfless Marxist , had fought for power too . Says Rachel : <P> " The friends of Lenin would not think of a contest for personal power . . . For them to confess that they had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were the victims of a struggle for personal power . . . Their message was for history . . . It deceived Henry Yagoda who was entrusted to prepare the confessions . . . . But the Khozyain was not deceived . . . . He , too , is an Old Bolshevik . . . . We know that he acted immediately because next day the trial was all confusion and the day after that . . . the Old Bolsheviks had become Traitors . " <P> Gregor , another member of the group , had risen in the NKVD as Yagoda 's interrogator and a leader in the Terror . A massive and subtle peasant , Gregor concedes that 7,000,000 enemies of the people were purged . " All gondevay , " says Mitka gaily . And Gregor , too , as one of the few witnesses still alive , knows he will soon be " gondevay . " <P> In Gregor 's mouth Novelist Blunden has put three stories , in the manner of Gogol , Chekhov and Dostoevsky respectively . Interspersed with these are chapters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light tank 25 kilometers from Moscow ; his lieutenant , Kostia , dying in a hospital after a double amputation ; Rachel 's son , Karl , starving in a concentration camp to which he had been sent for remarking that Hitler 's strategy was " cunning . " Karl 's hatred of the regime that imprisoned him hardens into conviction .
