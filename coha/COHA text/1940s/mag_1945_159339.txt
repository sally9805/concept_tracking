In the Los Angeles courtroom of Superior Judge Thurmond Clarke last week some 250 of West Adams ' residents stood at swords ' points . <P> Their story was as old as it was ugly . In 1938 , Negroes , willing and able to pay $15,000 and up for Heights property , had begun moving into the old colonial mansions .

They improved their holdings , kept their well-defined ways , quickly won more than tolerance from most of their white neighbors . <P> But some whites , refusing to be comforted , had drawn up a racial restriction covenant among themselves . For seven years they had tried to sell it to the other whites , but failed . Then they went to court . <P> For two hours , opposing counsel argued the constitutionality of eviction injunctions based on private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered the overtones , tall , well-groomed Judge Clarke decided to visit the disputed ground-popularly known as " Sugar Hill . " As he rose to leave , spectators noticed a portrait of Lincoln hanging behind the bench . Breathed one burly Negro : " I hope that judge has eyes in the back of his head . " <P> Apparently he had . Next morning , Janus-eyed Judge Clarke threw the case out of court . His reason : " It is time that members of the Negro race are accorded , without reservations or evasions , the full rights guaranteed them under the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution . Judges have been avoiding the real issue too long . " <P> Said Hattie McDaniel , of West Adams Heights : " Words can not express my appreciation . "
