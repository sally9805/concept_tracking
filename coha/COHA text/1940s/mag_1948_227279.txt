Christmas Day , 1948 will be " unpleasant with rain or snow , " and New Englanders may as well face it . Abe Weatherwise says so . For a century and a half , the meteorologist of the Old Farmer 's Almanac has been predicting the year-round weather , and for all its radar and radio balloons , the U.S. Weather Bureau has never been able to woo his fans away . His forecast for the coming winter is a moderately pesky one : <P> Icy . Winter of 1948-49 will not be as cold on the whole as the winter just past . However .. . there will be frequent storms of rain and sleet as well as snow which will create unusually icy conditions . <P> The Almanac goes to press before any of the usual seasonal signs appear : the nut stores of squirrels , or woollybear caterpillars ( TIME , Nov. 8 ) . Mr. Weatherwise just hauls off and predicts. * How in tophet does he do it ? This week , in the New York Times Magazine , Almanac Publisher Robb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck his Yankee tongue in his cheek and drawled a few clues . <P> " A completely fictional character he is , " wrote Sagendorph , " but . . . frankly , Abe Weatherwise is a mainstay around the office . " The Almanac had left Abe 's forecasts out just once , in 1938 : sales flopped , subscribers howled , and it will never happen again . <P> " Abe 's formula is just as secret now as it always has been . Over the years knowledge , theories , the results of experiments brought by travelers to the Indies , to far off China , Australia , Europe and Africa-and just across Boston 's Charles River-all this he has added to his own native wisdom ... But he has never mixed ... in his formula . " <P> Abe , who could n't exist without Sagen-dorph and his staff , " may forecast that a particular day will be ' warm . ' He never says how warm it will be ... I 'm not sure our definitions would be accepted in official weather circles . Abe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bald man 's head . Snow means you can see a cat 's tracks across the barn roof . These are meaningful definitions , but the specialists down at the Weather Bureau would probably have to hold their sides to keep from laughing . " Funny , though , says Sagen-dorph , how often Abe Weatherwise has the last laugh . <P> <P> *Last year 's winter prediction , " white , long and cold , " was right for the northeastern U.S. And on 22 " weather highlights " of 1947 , Weather-wise claimed he called the turn 50% of the time , the Weather Bureau only 27.2%.
