A lot of uniting will be required ever to bring the Lutherans of the U. S. into one church , for now they are divided into 17 different denominations . How much unifying is necessary was shown last week when just two of the 17 groups tried to unite-and failed . <P> One of the two groups was the United Lutheran Church ( 1,523,022 members ) , which believes that Lutherans are part of Protestantism as a whole and should not hold aloof from their brethren in the larger faith . The other was the American Lutheran Church ( 515,935 members ) , not quite so liberal as the United Lutherans ( but not so conservative , for example , as the Missouri Synod , 1,219,935 members , which feels that Lutherans are a closed corporation , should first unite themselves , then mingle with other sects only for the purpose of converting them ) . <P> Last fortnight the United Lutherans met in Omaha and the American Lutherans in Detroit for their biennial conventions , attempted to merge . Between the two groups stood chiefly an argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Word of God , but American Lutherans believe it more literally . A joint commission on closer union ( " pulpit and altar fellowship " ) had devised a formula which it hoped both could accept : " By virtue of a unique operation of the Holy Spirit , by which He supplied to the holy writers content and fitting word , the separate books of the Bible are related to one another , and , taken together , constitute a complete , errorless , unbreakable whole of which Christ is the centre . " <P> Jammed into the ballroom of Omaha 's Hotel Fontenelle , the United Lutherans re-elected their perennial president ( he has held the job since the church was organized in 1918 ) : precise , white-goateed Dr. Frederick Hermann Knubel , 70 , of Manhattan . Dr. Knubel admitted he could swallow the articles of agreement only by " gulping . " The United Lutherans , who think some parts of the Scripture more important than others , had to swallow hard too . But under Dr. Knubel 's brisk leadership and spurred by their desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Less hasty were the American Lutherans , meeting in the ultra-plain parish hall of Detroit 's Salem 's Lutheran Church . Said ruddy , robust Dr. Emmanuel Poppen of Columbus , Ohio , their president : " The church 's 1,600 pastors and 2,000 congregations must have an opportunity to be heard . " Upshot : the American Lutherans expressed a fervent hope that they and the United Lutherans might both soon be united with the Missouri Synod . They appointed a new commission to continue negotiations . <P> Somewhat dashed , the United Lutherans took what comfort they could in the fact that they had at least achieved union with the few ( 6,000 ) U. S. and Canadian members of the Icelandic Synod .
