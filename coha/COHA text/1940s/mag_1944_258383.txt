Into a Hollywood dentist 's office marched a desperate flute player . His new false teeth were ruining his career as a musician . Dr. Elia C. Epstein reported the case in Dental Survey last week : <P> " ' Doctor , ' said the flutist , ' the teeth of my present bridge are too long and they have nasty spaces . . . between them . I have no support for the mouthpiece . . . and the air flows right out between the necks of the teeth . Now , doctor , can you close up these spaces . . . and grind out some sort of shelf . . . to accommodate the neck of the flute ? ' <P> " I understood . My patient cared little about esthetics or mastication at that moment . All he wanted was to be able to play his flute . . . . I finally made him a lower denture with clasps . . . . The patient , elated by this success , decided to have the upper remade . <P> " For my first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and play for me , with the new teeth in position . . . . Trouble was discovered almost at once . After playing for a few moments , my musical patient laid his instrument aside with an air of utter resignation . ' Doctor , that depression in the center of the palate is no good for me-the air becomes stranded in the hollow . I ca n't produce a normal legato ! ' <P> " I filled in the hollow . The results were gratifying , but not for long . After playing his instrument again , my patient was once again a picture of gloom . ' Doctor , my legato has improved . . . but now I lose my wind too quickly . ' I partially closed up the arch in the bicuspid region . ' Fine , ' said my patient after another experiment with his flute . Then the patient suddenly stopped and his face registered horror . ' Doctor , I 'm losing my staccato ! ' <P> " Once again I rearranged the teeth in wax and made my patient play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much room between the occlusion of the front upper and lower . . . . To correct this condition , I reset the front teeth several times . . . . For the final test he tried the famous William Tell duet full of staccatos and he passed with colors flying . ' " <P> Next morning Dr. Epstein 's phone rang . It was his secretary . " ' Mr. X the flutist has just broken a tooth in his new denture . And oh , doctor , he is whistling now . ' ' Make my coffee a little stronger this morning , ' I said to Mrs. Epstein. "
