In Andy Jackson 's day , the Nashville Republican had already gone to press when a big story came in . So the conscientious editor laboriously scrawled on the margin of each copy his last-minute bulletin : " Mrs. Jackson has just Expired . " <P> Last week , U.S. editors had much bigger news to report quickly , but with far better mechanical facilities . The public was hungry for details . Said Ivan Annenberg , circulation manager of Manhattan 's Daily News : " In all my years of newspapering , I have never seen papers sold so fast . " Newspapermen had long since conceded radio 's advantage in speed . They had almost forgotten how it felt to sell " extras . " But this time it was different . <P> The man who broke the news to the press was himself an able , veteran newsman-Steve Early . Taking over from Jonathan Daniels , his successor as White House press secretary , who was shaking and white-faced with shock , Early quickly set up a three-way call to the press associations to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President died suddenly early this afternoon . " <P> Then , as nearly every accredited correspondent in the capital crowded into the White House press room , it was Steve Early who climbed up on a leather chair , and in an even , taut voice gave the press a chronology of the President 's last hours . <P> " Turning the Rules . " The news broke after most Eastern afternoon papers had completed their press runs , but some managed to get out hasty extras . Both Manhattan 's Daily News and PM covered their entire front page with a photograph of Franklin Roosevelt . Before midnight , the New York Times hit the streets with five full pages on Roosevelt 's career which had been set up in type in advance . Many U.S. newspapers were similarly forearmed , and slip-ups were few . But on Hearst 's San Antonio Light , a Mexican copy boy who could not read English clipped the news flash off the teletype and hung it on a hook at the news desk , where it lay unnoticed for 20 minutes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tearing up its forms to report a tornado.
