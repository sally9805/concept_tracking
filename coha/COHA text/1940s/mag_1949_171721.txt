Those of you who remember a story called " Drug for Drunks " in TIME 'S Medicine section of the December 6 issue may be interested to know how we got it and what happened after we ran it . <P> The story told about the accidental discovery of the effect that a drug named antabus has had in arousing a loathing for alcohol in almost everybody who has taken it . According to Copenhagen 's Dr. Erik Jacobsen , who discovered the drug 's anti-alcoholic potentialities , TIME was the first U.S. publication to print the story . <P> TIME Inc. ' s Copenhagen stringman , Kai Schou , first heard of antabus at a lecture at Copenhagen 's medical association . There Dr. Oluf Martensen-Larsen , a specialist in the treatment of alcoholism , told publicly for the first time about the results his clinic had been getting from the drug . He had volunteered to try it on his patients after Dr. Jacobsen had finished experimenting with it in his laboratory . <P> Reporter Schou got in touch with Dr. Jacobsen and followed the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periodicals reported on various aspects of it , but not until the interim review of the first 500 patients to be treated with antabus was published in November did Schou consider the story solid . He submitted it to TIME 'S Medicine editor , and it was published . <P> As soon as the U.S. and the four overseas editions of the December 6 issue had been distributed across the world , Dr. Jacobsen began hearing from TIME 'S readers and their friends - by cable , airmail , telephone and letter in seven languages . Most of the communications were addressed merely to " Doctor Jacobsen , Copenhagen , " leaving it up to the post office to find him. * Last week Dr. Jacobsen 's elderly male secretary was so overworked answering the mail that he collapsed . <P> The phraseology of most of the letters is identical , saying : " My husband father , son , brother , nephew , friend , etc. is a good man but a habitual alcoholic . Please send the drug mentioned in TIME . I enclose a check for . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In undertaking to answer each communication , Dr. Jacobsen has told all of the senders-except physicians and commercial firms-to have their doctors write to him a dangerous corner , " and that in so doing a doctor 's advice is needed . <P> TIME has also received scores of letters from individuals , doctors , drug firms , medical journals , etc. , asking for further information about antabus . All have been answered . A second story on Scandinavia 's experience with the drug ( TIME , Jan. 10 ) showed that there were dangerous aspects to antabus . A Helsinki housewife had loaded the canapes with it at her husband 's stag party , which ended with everybody getting sick and some guests going to the hospital . As usual , TIME 'S Medicine editor made no suggestions or recommendations about the use of antabus . He is gratified , nevertheless , at this impressive evidence of the readership his section has-right around the world . <P> * There are 7,800 Jacobsens in Denmark 's capital .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
