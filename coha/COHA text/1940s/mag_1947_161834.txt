Mexico 's aging " Big Three " - Orozco , Siqueiros and Rivera-have plastered miles of Mexican walls with bayonets , clenched fists , streaming banners and broken chains . That kind of thing is no longer up-to-date . Last week Rufino Tamayo , 47 , the most important of Mexico 's " younger " painters , opened a one-man show in Manhattan . Revolutionary violence is not his game ; he paints the classless society of his own imagination . <P> Tamayo 's paintings hang in over a dozen U.S. museums , sell like hot tamales at prices ranging up to $5,000 . His new show impressed critics and tickled Tamayo collectors as usual . And , as usual , it sent conscientious gallerygoers swearing into the street , wishing they knew what moderns like Tamayo were driving at . <P> At first glance the colors looked muddy or sometimes acidly off-register . Tamayo 's figures lifted swollen hands and feet , like anthropomorphic cactus plants , and stared from flat , featureless heads . Behind them the fuzzy skies were scratched with schoolboy diagrams of the constellations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed perfectly adjusted to their painted world , and the star-spangled night skies ( a new element in Tamayo 's work ) seemed to suggest the era of science . <P> A Zapotecan Indian born in the tropical state of Oaxaca , Tamayo was orphaned at ten , brought up in Mexico City 's fruit markets by an aunt . " My feeling is Mexican , " he grins , " my color is Mexican , my shapes are Mexican , but my thinking is a mixture . " <P> Eight years ago he forsook Mexico , moved with his wife into an apartment on Manhattan 's East 93rd Street , where he reads up on astronomy and physics for inspiration and paints in a bare back room . Painting is no fun , he says ; " it has to be done with our insides , our heart , even our intestines . The painter is like a mother bearing a child . It has to hurt a lot-and the more it hurts the more healthy it is . " Mystified onlookers were relieved to hear that it hurt Tamayo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
