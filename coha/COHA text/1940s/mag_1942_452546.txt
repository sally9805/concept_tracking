SUNELY I must he dreaming . It is as if I were fifteen again . I ant bac at school . My mind is On my geometry problem . Leaning over the worn black desk , I work away dutifully with compass and ruler and protractor . I am quiet and industrious . Near by sit sonic of my schoolmates , talking in murmurs . One of them stands at a blackboard chalking up figures . Others less studious are playing bridge . Out of doors I see the branch of a tree swaying in the breeze . I drop my work and stare at it . From an industrious mil I have become an idle one . The shining sun fills use with peace . 1 in bale with delight the childhood odor of the wooden desk , the chalk , the blackboard in this schoolhouse in which we arc quartered . I revel in the sense of security born of this daydream of a sheltered childhood . What course life takes we all know . We are children , we are sent to school , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are graduated . Some sort of diploma is handed to us , and our hearts pound as we are ushered across a certain threshold , marched through a certain porch , the other side of which we are I the of a sudden grown men . Now our footfalls strike the ground wills a new assurance . We have itegun to make our way in life , to take the first few steps of our way in life . We are about to measure our strength against real adversaries . The ruler , the ' I ' square , the compass , have become weapons with which we shall build a world , triumph over ILII enemy . Playtime is over . All this I see as I stare at the swaying branch . And I see too that schoolboys have no fear of facing life . They champ at the bit . The jealousies , the trials , the sorrows of the life of man do not intimidate the schoolboy . But what a strange schoolboy I am ! I sit in this schoolroom , a schoolboy conscious of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a schoolboy aware of its cares . . . . Dutertre comes by , and I stop him . ' Sit down . I 'll do some card tricks for you . ' Dutertre sits facing me on a desk as worn as mine . I can see his booted legs as he shuffles the cards . Hose pleased with myself I am when I pick out the deleted material He sat tapping on the table with his pencil . I stared at him . His face was drawn . He had had no sleep . Back and forth in a motorcar he had driven all night in search of a phantom General Staff . He had been summoned to division headquarters ? to brigade headquarters . He had argued and wrangled with supply depots that never delivered the spare parts they promised . His car had been bottled up in the crazy traffic . He had supervised our last moving out and our most recent moving in ? for we were driven by the enemy from one field to another like poor devils scrambling in the van of a relentless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving our lorries , saving the files of the Group . He looked as if he had reached the end of his strength , of his nerves . ' Well , ' he said , and he went on tapping with his pencil . He was still not looking at us . A moment passed before he spoke again . ' It 's damned awkward , ' he said finally ; and he shrugged his shoulders . ' A damned awkward sortie . But the Staff people want it done . They very much want it done . I argued with them ; but they want it done . . . . And that 's that . ' Dutertre and I sat looking out of the window . Here too a branch was swaying in the breeze . I could hear the cackle of the hens . Our Intelligence Room had been set up in a schoolhouse ; the major 's office was in a farmhouse . It would be easy to write a couple of fraudulent pages out of the contrast between this shining spring day , the ripening fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat ? and death at our elbow . I shall not write that couple of pages because I see no reason why the peace of a spring day should constitute a contradiction of the idea of death . Why should the sweetness of life be a matter for irony ? But a vague notion did go through my mind as I stared out of Alias 's window . ' The spring has broken down , ' I said to myself ; ' the season is out of order . ' I had flown over abandoned threshing machines , abandoned binders . I had seen motorcars deserted in roadside ditches . I had come upon a village square standing under water while the village faucet ' the fountain , ' as our people call it ? stood open and the stream flowed on . And suddenly a completely ridiculous image came into my mind . I thought of clocks out of order . All the clocks of France ? out of order . Clocks in their church steeples . Clocks on railway stations . Chimney clocks in empty houses . A charnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , is that thing in which clocks are no longer wound up ? in which beets are no longer gathered in ? in which farm carts are no longer greased . And that water , collected and piped to quench men 's thirst and to whiten the Sunday laces of the village women ? that water stands now in a pool flooding the square before the village church . As for Alias , he was talking like a bedside physician . ' Tim , ' says the doctor with a shake of the head , ' rather awkward , this ' ; and you know that he is hinting that you ought to be making your will , thinking of those you are about to leave behind . There was no question in Dutertre 's mind or mine but that Alias was talking about sacrificing another crew . ' And , ' Alias went on , ' things being as they are , it 's no good worrying about the chances you run . ' Quite so . No good at all . And it 's no one 's fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too cheerful . Not the major 's fault that he is ill at ease with us . Not the Staff 's fault that it gives orders . The major is out of sorts because the orders are absurd . We know that they are absurd ; but the Staff knows that as well as we do . It gives orders because orders have to be given . Giving orders is its the language as lyrical as the futility of the sortie required . I had my own thoughts . ' Another crew flung away , ' I said to myself . My head was buzzing , buzzing with many things ; but I said to myself that I 'd wait . If we got back , if we were alive that night , I 'd do my thinking then . If we were alive . When a sortie was not ' awkward , ' one plane out of three got back . Naturally the ratio was not the same when the sortie was a nasty one . But I was not weighing my chances of getting back . As I sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me neither august , nor majestic , nor heroic , nor poignant . Death seemed to me merely a sign of disorder ? a consequence of disorder . The Group was to lose us more or less as baggage becomes lost in the hubbub of changing trains . Not that on the subject of war , of death , of sacrifice , of France , I do not think quite other things than what I now say ; but as I sat in that office my thoughts were without a compass , my language was a blur . I sat thinking in contradictions . My concept of truth had been shattered , and the best I could do was to stare at one fragment after another . ' If I am alive , ' I said to myself , ' I shall do my thinking tonight . ' Night , the beloved . Night , when language fades and things come alive ; when the destructive analysis of day is done , and all that is truly important becomes whole and sound again ; when man reassembles his fragmentary self and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Day belongs to family quarrels , but with the night he who has quarreled finds love again . For love is greater than any wind of words . And man , leaning at his window under the stars , is once again responsible for the bread of the day to come , for the slumber of the wife who lies by his side , all fragile and delicate and contingent . Love is not thinking , but being . As I sat facing Alias I longed for night and for the rebirth in me of the being that merits love ? for night , when my thoughts would be of civilization , of the destiny of man , of the savor of friendship in my native land ; for night , so that I might know that in my heart something imperious , though at this moment inexpressible , still lived ; for night , so that I might perhaps advance a step towards fixing it in my unmanageable language . I longed for night as the poet might do , the true poet who feels himself inhabited by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images like ramparts round that thing in order to capture it ? to capture it in a snare of images . And as I sat there longing for night I was for the moment like a Christian abandoned by grace . I was about to do my job with Dutertre honorably ? that was certain ; but to do it as one honors ancient rites when they have no longer any significance , when the god that lived in them has withdrawn from them . I should wait for night , I said to myself ; and if I was still alive I would walk alone on the highway that runs through our village ? alone and safely isolated in my beloved solitude , so that I might discover why it is I ought to die . I awoke out of my daydream ? was startled out of it by an astonishing proposal . If this sortie bothers you , Saint-Ex , if you do n't feel up to it today , I can ? ' Oh , come , Major ! ' He knew perfectly well that his proposal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a pilot does n't get back you begin to recall how solemn he was when he was ordered out ? and solemn he would have been indeed , for no man is very cheerful at the moment of jumping into a volcano . You say to yourself that he must have had a premonition of his end , and you accuse yourself of having willfully brushed it aside . You take time out for an attack of conscience . The major 's scruple reminded me of Israel . Two days before , I had been sitting smoking at the window of the Intelligence Room . Israel , when I caught sight of him through the window , was walking swiftly past . His nose was red . A big nose , very Jewish and very red . Suddenly there had seemed to me something queer about that big red nose . This Israel , whose nose I was staring at , was a man I profoundly liked . He was one of the most courageous pilots of the Group ? one of the most courageous and one of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wariness that he probably mistook his courage for a form of wariness . To gain a victory is to act warily . There I sat , watching that red nose that gleamed in my sight only for an instant , so swift were the steps that carried Israel and his nose out of view . I turned to Gavoille , and without meaning to make a joke of it I said , ' Why do you suppose his nose is like that ? ' Gavoille answered , ' God made it like that ' ; and then added quickly , ' Low-altitude sortie . Ca n't blame the fellow . ' That night , when we had given up looking for Israel to get back , I thought again of that nose , planted in the middle of a totally expressionless face and yet revealing , with a sort of genius of its own , the burden of the thoughts revolt , ing in the man 's mind . If it had been my job to order Israel on that sortie , the memory of his nose would have haunted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the order with no more than a ' Yes , sir , ' a ' Very good , sir . ' Israel , surely , had not allowed a single muscle of his face to quiver on hearing the order . But gently , insidiously , treacherously , his nose had reddened . Israel had been able to control the muscles of his face , but not the color of his nose . And in the silence in which he had received the order his nose had taken advantage of him . Unknown to Israel , it had made clear to the major its emphatic disapproval of the sortie . This was the kind of thing that made Alias hesitate to send into action men he imagined might be subject to premonitions . Premonitions are more often false than true ; but when you are seized by one a military order will sound like a court sentence . And Alias was not a judge , after all , but a group commander . There was the case the other day of the gunner I shall call T. As Israel was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the only man I have ever known who really felt fear . When , during the war , you gave T. an order , you released in him at that moment a wave of dizziness ? something simple , relentless , and gradual . Rising slowly from his feet to his head , a stiffening would come over his whole body . Little by little his face would go dead white . And his eyes would begin to shine . - Unlike Israel , whose nose , reddened with irritation , had seemed to me so disapproving , disapproving of the probable death of Israel , T. manifested no psychic mutation . He did not react ? he moulted . When you had finished giving 1 ' . an order you discovered that you had lit a flame of anguish in him , and that the anguish had begun to spread a sort of even glow through his being . Thereafter T. 's face would shine softly with a pale light . T. would become a man indifferent to everything . I am sure that death itself became a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate the loss that must ensue . It is love . But there was no love in T. He was not grieving over what he would leave behind . His whole being was delivered up to anguish ? to anguish alone . Never in any other man on earth have I perceived this form of ecstasy . ' I should n't have let him fly that day , ' Alias said to me . For that day , when the major had given T. his orders , T. had not merely turned white , he had begun to smile , quite plainly to smile ? as tortured men smile , probably , when really the executioner has gone too far . You 're off your feed today , T. I 'll get another gunner . ' If you please , sir . It 's my turn , ' T. had answered . He was standing respectfully at attention , but with an extraordinary gleam of defiance in his eye . Still , if you do n't feel sure of yourself ? ' It 's my turn out , sir . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' T. had interrupted ; and his whole body looked full of anger . So , ' Alias concluded , ' I let him have his way . ' Exactly what happened we never knew . T. , sitting aft as gunner of the crew , had seen a German fighter bear down on him . The German 's guns had jammed , and he had turned tail and vanished . T. had exchanged remarks with his pilot through the speaking tube all the way back to the neighborhood of their base . The pilot had observed nothing abnormal in T. 's conversation . But about five minutes before lunching T. had stopped talking , and the pilot had been unable to raise him . That same evening T. was brought in , his skull split open by the tail unit of his own plane . He had tried to bail out over home territory where he was completely out of danger . The plane had been flying at high speed , and he had done a had job of parachuting . The passage of that German fighter had been irresistible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now , ' the major said . ' I want you off the ground at five-thirty . ' We said , ' See you this evening , sir , ' and the major responded by a vague wave of the hand . Was it superstition ? I turned to leave , became aware that my cigarette was out , and was fumbling in vain through all my pockets when the major said testily , ' Why is it you never carry any matches ? ' It was true ; and with this substitute for ' Good luck ! ' in my ears I shut the door , saying to myself , ' Why is it I never have a match on me ? ' Dutertre said , ' This sortie has got on his nerves . ' He does n't give a damn about it , ' I thought . But I did n't say so aloud , for I was n't thinking of Alias . I was thinking of man in general . What had happened was that I had been brought up with a jerk by a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of the spirit , the veritable life , is intermittent , and only the life of the mind is constant . This instant and spontaneous reflection leads back to Alias in a roundabout way . Man 's spirit is not concerned with objects ; that is the business of our analytical faculties . Man 's spirit is concerned with the significance that relates objects to one another ? with their totality , which only the piercing eye of the spirit can perceive . The spirit , meanwhile , alternates between total vision and absolute blindness . Here is a man , for example , who loves his farm ? but there are moments when he sees in it only a collection of unrelated objects . Here is a man who loves his wife ? but there are moments when he sees in love nothing but burdens , hindrances , constraints . Here is a man who loves music ? but there are moments when it can not reach him . What we call a nation is certainly not the sum of the regions , customs , cities , farms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able at any moment to add up . It is a Being . But there are moments when I find myself blind to beings ? even to the being called France . Major Alias had spent the previous night at Staff headquarters discussing what was in effect pure logic . Pure logic is the ruin of the spirit . Afterwards he had driven back , and driving back he had worn himself out getting through the tangled traffic . Having finally reached Es billet , he had found a hundred details to look after , those details that fray a man 's nerves and set him on edge . And this afternoon he had sent for us and ordered us to em- bark upon an utterly impossible sortie . What were we to him ? Particles in the universal chaos . We were not SaintExupery and Dutertre to him ? each with our own way of seeing or not seeing things , of thinking , walking , smiling , drinking . We were mere details in a vast structure to see the whole of which demanded more time , more silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face been afflicted with a tic , he would have been able to see nothing but the tic . He would have sent out over Arras the memory of a tic . In this senseless hullabaloo , in this avalanche , we ourselves , each of us , saw nothing but particles : that voice ; that nose ; that tic . And particles are not the objects of anybody 's emotion . Thus I am not talking about Alias specifically , but about man in general . A friend you love has died , and it is you who must see that he is decently buried . At that moment you have no contact with your dead friend . How can you have ? Death is a thing of grandeur . It brings instantly into being a whole new network of relations between you and the ideas , the desires , the habits of the man now dead . It is a rearrangement of the world . Nothing has changed visibly , yet everything has changed . The pages of the book are the same , but the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who are busy with funeral details , know any of this ? Do you wish to bring the dead friend to mind ? You must be able to imagine yourself needing him . At that moment you will miss him . Imagine him needing you . Ah , but he no longer needs you ! Imagine those Wednesdays when , invariably , you lunched together . Wednesday is now a vacuum . Life , we know , has to be seen in perspective . But on a day of burial there is no perspective ? for space itself is annihilated . Your dead friend is still a fragmentary being . The day you bury him is a day of chores and crowds , of hands false or true to be shaken , of the immediate cares of mourn-ing . The dead friend will not really die until tomorrow , when silence is round you again . Then he will show himself complete , as he was ? to tear himself away , as he was , from the substantial you . Only then will you cry out because of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am still on the track of my thought when I say that I do not like the pretty picture-book of war . The gruff warrior squeezing back a tear and hiding his honest emotion under a grumpy exterior . What nonsense ! The gruff warrior is not hiding anything at all . If he lets fly a gruff remark it is because a gruff remark has come into his mind . Nor does it matter for my purpose whether a man be decent or a brute . Major Alias is a noble person . He is a sensitive person . If Dutertre and I fail to get back it will probably affect him more than anyone else in the Group ? provided , however , that he thinks of Saint-Exupery and Dutertre , and not of a sum of unrelated particles ; provided that he be allowed the silence in which to effect this reconstruction of ourselves . For if , tonight , the bailiff at our heels once more constrains the Group to move , a single broken-clown lorry will suffice to put off our death until another time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The life of the spirit , I say , is intermittent ? my own spirit as much as Alias 's . I am off on an ' awkward ' sortie . Is my mind filled with the thought of the war of the Nazi against the Occident ? Not at all . I think in terms of immediate details . I think of possible wounds . I think of the absurdity of flying over German-held Arras at two thousand feet ; of the futility of the intelligence we are asked to bring back ; of the interminable time it takes to dress in these clothes that remind me of men made ready for the executioner . And I think of my gloves . Where the devil are my gloves ? I have lost my gloves . I can no longer see the cathedral in which I live . I am dressing for the service of a dead god . III Get going ! Where are my gloves ? . . . No , not those . Have a look in my bag . ' Sorry , sir . Ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' Everybody is a fool . My fitter , who does n't know where my gloves are . Hitler , who unloosed this mad war . And that fellow on the General Staff , obsessed by low-altitude sorties . ' I asked you to get me a pencil . I have been asking you for ten minutes to find me a pencil . Have n't you got a pencil ? ' Here it is , sir . ' One man , at least , who is not a fool . Tie a string round it . NOW knot the string through this buttonhole. : . . I say , gunner , you seem to be taking things very easily . ' I 'm all ready , sir . ' ' Oh ! ' And my observer . I swung round to him . ' Everything shipshape , Dutertre ? Nothing missing ? Worked out your course ? ' He has worked out his course . ' Awkward ' sortie indeed ! Where is the sense , I ask you , in sending a crew out to be murdered for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never reach the Staff anyway , even if one of us lives to report it ? Mediums , ' I said aloud . ' They must have a crew of mediums on the General Staff . ' What do you mean , Captain ? ' How do you think we 'll report to them ? They are going to communicate with us . Table tipping . Automatic writ ing . ' Not very funny ; but I went on grousing . General Staffs ! Let them fly their own damned sorties ! ' It takes a long time to dress for a sortie that you know is a hopeless one ; a longtime to harness yourself only for the fun of being blasted to bits . Here are three thicknesses of clothing to be put on , one over the other ; that takes time . And this clutter of accessories that you carry about like an itinerant pedlar ! All this complication of oxygen tubes , heating equipment ; these speaking tubes that form the ' intercom ' running between members of the crew ; this mask through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rubber tube as indispensable as an umbilical cord . The plane is plugged in to the circulation of my blood . Organs have been added to my being , and they seem to intervene between me and my heart . From one minute to the next I grow heavier , more cumbrous , harder to handle . I turn round all of a piece , and when I bend down to tighten my straps , or pull at buckles that resist , all my joints creak aloud . My old fractures begin to hurt again . Hand me another helmet . I 've told you twenty times that my own wo n't do . It 's too tight . ' God knows why , but a rnan 's skull swells at high altitude . A helmet that fits perfectly on the ground becomes a vise pressing on the skull at thirty thousand feet . Tut this is another helmet , sir . I sent back your old one . ' Huh ! ' I can not stop grousing , and I grouse without remorse . A lot of good it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment of timelessness . This is the crossing of the inner desert of anguish . There is no god here . There is no face to love . There is no France , no Europe , no civilization . There are particles , detritus , nothing more . I feel no shame at this moment in praying for a miracle that should change the course of this afternoon ? the miracle , for instance , of a speaking tube out of order . Speaking tubes are always going out of order . Trashy stuff ! A speaking tube out of order would preserve us from the holocaust . Captain Vesain came in with a gloomy look . No pilot ever got off the ground without a dose of Captain Vesain 's gloom . His job was to report upon the position of the German air outposts ; to tell us where they were . Vesain is my friend , and is very fond of me ; but he is a bird of ill omen . I prefer not to meet him when I am about to take off . Looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . Very bad indeed . ' And did n't he pull a sheaf of papers out of his pocket , to impress me ! Then , looking at me suspiciously , he said , ' How are you going out ? ' By the town of Albert . ' ' I thought so . I knew it . Bad business . ' Stop talking like a bloody fool ! What 's up ? ' You 'll never make it . You 'll have to give up this sortie . ' Give up this sortie ! Very kind of him to say so . Let him tell that to God the Father . Perhaps He 'll put a curse on our speaking tubes . You 'll never get through , I tell you ! ' And why shall I never get through ? ' Because there are three groups of German fighters circling permanently over Albert . One at eighteen thousand feet , another at twenty-five thousand , and a third at thirty-three thousand . They fly in relays and hang on until they are relieved . It 's what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German net . See here ! ' He shoved a sheet of paper at me on which he had scribbled an absolutely unintelligible demonstration of his argument . Vesain would have done much better to keep his nose out of my affairs . His pompous categorically blocked had impressed me , confound him ! I thought instantly of red lights and traffic tickets . Only , this was a place where a ticket meant death . It was his categorically that particularly galled me . It seemed to be aimed at me personally . I made a great effort to think clearly . The enemy , ' I said to myself , ' always defends his positions categorically . Damned nonsense , these big words ! And besides , why should I worry about German fighter planes ? At highs altitude I should never know they bad got me ; and at two thousand feet it is the antiaircraft that would get me , not the lighters . It could n't possibly miss me . ' Suddenly I became belligerent . ' In short , what you 're telling me is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sortie is not altogether advisable . Run along and tell that to the General . ' It would n't have cost Vesain anything to reassure me pleasantly , instead of upsetting me . Why could n't he have said , ' Oh , by the way ? the Germans have a few fighters aloft over Albert ' ? It would have come to the same thing . IV We climbed in . I had still to test the intercom . Can you hear me , Du ter tre ? ' I hear you , Captain . ' You , gunner ! Hear me ? ' ' I ? yes , sir . Clearly . ' Dutertre ! Can you hear the gunner ? ' Clearly , Captain . ' Gunner ! Can you hear Lieutenant Dutertre ? ' ' I ? er ? yes , sir . Clearly . ' What makes you stutter back there ? What are you hesitating about ? ' Sorry , sir . I was looking for my pencil . ' The speaking tubes were not out of order . Gunner ! Have a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? yes , sir . Normal . ' ' In all three bottles ? ' All three , sir . ' All set , Dutertre ? ' All set , Captain . ' All set , gunner ? ' All set , sir . ' We took off . V Human anguish is due at bottom to the loss by man of his true identity . I sit waiting for a telegram which is to announce to me either a death or a recovery . Time flows by unutilized , and holds me in suspense . Time has ceased to be a stream that feeds me , nourishes me , adds growth to me . It carries me neither towards my joy nor towards my sorrow . Each second that drops is void of meaning . It does not age me in any sense whatever . And , for want of knowing who I am , I ant possessed by anguish . The bad news , when it comes , causes me no anxiety . It causes me to suffer , which is not the same thing . He who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , waits to find out if he is or is not a murderer . So long as he remains ignorant of the fate of his victim , he is deprived of identity . Suspended in a void , he is the prey of anguish . Guilt is not a cause of anguish . It may provoke remorse or despair . But despair is something else . T. never knew whether , in the hour to come , he was to be transmuted into a living man or a dead man . He was aware of only one thing ? the flow of time , running like sand through his fingers while he waited for the coming of a certain instant too rich in power for his resist ance . For me , piloting my plane , time has ceased to run sterile through my fingers . Now , finally , I am installed in my function . Time is no longer a thing apart from me . I have stopped projecting myself into the future . I am no longer he who may perhaps dive down the sky in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunting phantom , for from this moment on I shall myself create the future by my own successive acts . I am he who checks the course and holds the compass at me , who controls the revolutions of the propeller and the temperature of the oil . These are healthy and immediate cares . These are householdcares , the little duties of the day that take away the taste of growing older . The day becomes a house brilliantly clean , a floor well waxed , oxygen prudently doled out . . . . Thinking this , I check the oxygen flow , for we have been rising fast and are at twenty-two thousand feet already . Oxygen all right , Dutertre ? How do you feel ? ' First-rate , Captain . ' You , gunner ! How 's your oxygen ? ' I ? er ? shipshape , sir . ' Have n't you found that pencil yet ? ' And I am he who checks his machine guns , putting a finger on button S , on button A ? which reminds me . Gunner ! No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Er ? all clear , sir . ' Check your guns . Let fly . ' I hear the blast of the guns . Work all right ? ' Worked fine , sir . ' All of them ? ' Er ? yes , sir . All of them . ' I test my own and wonder what becomes of all the bullets that we scatter so heedlessly over our home territory . They never kill anyone . The earth is vast . Now time is nourishing me with every minute that passes . I am a thing as little the prey of anguish as a ripening fruit . Of course the circumstances of this flight will change round me ? the circumstances and the problems . But I dwell now well inside the fabrication of the future . Time , little by little , is kneading me into shape . A child is not frightened at the thought of being patiently transmuted into an old man . He is a child and he plays like a child . I too play my games . I count the dials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my kingdom . I count one hundred and three objects to check , pull , turn , or press . ( Perhaps I have cheated in counting my machine-gun controls as two ? one for the trigger , and another for the safety catch . ) Tonight when I get back I shall amaze the farmer with whom I am billeted . I shall say to him , ' Ho you know how many instruments a pilot has to look after ? ' How do you expect me to know that ? ' No matter . Guess . Name a figure . ' What figure ? ' My farmer is not a man of tact . Any figure . Name one . ' Seven . ' One hundred and three ! ' And I shall smile with satisfaction . Another thing contributes to my peace of mind ? it is that all the instruments that were an encumbrance while I was dressing have now settled into place and acquired meaning . All that tangle of tubes:andlwiring has become a circulatory network . I am an organism integrated into the plane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall and my oxygen , /land the plane begins to generate my comfort . The oxygen , incidentally , is too hot . It burns my nose . A complicated mechanism releases it in proportion to the altitude at which I fly , and I am flying high . The plane is my wet nurse . Before we took off , this thought seemed to me inhuman ; but now , suckled by the plane itself , I feel a sort of filial affection for it ? the affection of a nursling . My weight , meanwhile , is comfortably distributed over a variety of points of support . I am like a feeble convalescent stripped of bodily consciousness and lying in a chaise longue . The convalescent exists only as a frail thought . My triple thickness of clothing is without weight in my seat . My parachute , slung behind , lies against the back of my seat . My enormous boots rest on the bar that operates the rudder . My hands , which are so awkward when first I slip on the thick stiff gloves , handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheel . . . . Dutertre !

' I did n't want to dive unless I had to . The gunner might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as roughly as I could . Captain , sir ? ' That you , gunner ? ' I ? er  --  yes , sir . ' Not sure it 's you ? ' Yes , sir . ' Why the devil did n't you answer before ? ' I had pulled the plug , sir . I was testing the radio . ' You 're a bloody fool ! Do you think you 're alone in this plane ? I was just about to dive . I thought you were dead . ' Er ? no , sir . ' I 'll take your word for it . But do n't play that trick on me again . Damn it ! Let me know before you cut . ' Sorry , sir . I will . I 'll let you know , sir . ' Had his oxygen flow stopped working , he would n't have known it . The human body receives no warning . A vague swooning comes over you . In a few seconds you have fainted . In a few minutes you are dead . The flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I pinched my tube lightly a few times and felt the warm life-bringing puffs blow round my nose . It came to this , that I was working at my trade . All that I felt was the physical pleasure of going through gestures that meant something and were sufficient unto themselves . I was conscious neither of great danger ( it had been different while I was dressing ) nor of performing a great duty . At this moment the battle between the Nazi and the Occident was reduced to the scale of my job , of my manipulation of certain switches , levers , taps . This was as it should be . The sexton 's love of his God becomes a love of lighting candles . The sexton moves with deliberate step through a church of which he is barely conscious , happy to see the candlesticks bloom one after the other as the result of his ministrations . When he has lighted them all , he rubs his hands . He is proud of himself . I for my part am doing a good job of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my compass lies within a single degree of my course . If Dutertre happens to have his eye on the compass , he must be marveling at me . ' I say , Dutertre ! Compass on the course ? How does it look ? ' Wo n't do , Captain . Too much drift . A little kick to the right . ' Well , well . Crossing our lines , Captain . I 've started my camera . What 's your alti-tude ? ' Thirty-three thousand . ' VI Your course , Captain ! ' He 's right . I was drifting to port . And not by chance , either . It was the town of Albert that was putting me off . I could make it out faintly , far ahead . But already it was shouldering me off with all the weight of its categorically blocked . Extraordinary , the memory secreted in the recesses of the human body ! My body was remembering every sudden crash of the past , every cranial fracture , each of those nights in hospital with their comas as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It struggles to avoid Albert . The moment I leave it to itself , we drift to port . It shies left like an old horse fearful for life of the obstacle that had once frightened it . And it is really my body , not my mind , that I mean . The moment my mind wanders , my body takes sly advantage of me to slip around Albert . For it is not I who feel any anxiety . I have stopped wishing to get out of this sortie . On the ground , it had seemed to me that that was what I wanted . I had said to myself hopefully that the intercom would be out of order . I was weary , and it would be wonderful to sleep . The bed of idleness had seemed to me a magic couch . But deep down I had known perfectly well that nothing could come of getting out of this sortie except a sharp sense of discomfort ; as if a necessary moulting had miscarried ; as if I had rnuffed a chance to be born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? of a time when I was very young . how long ago was that ? I ' Captain ! ' What 's up ? ' Er . . . nothing . I thought I had seen something . ' I do n't like Dutertre seeing things . Of school , yes . When you are a little boy , in boarding school , they get you up too early . They get you up at six o'clock . It is cold . You rub your eyes , and you hate class long before the bell rings . You think how wonderful it would be if you were ill and were waking up in the infirmary , where the matron would be ready with a hot cup of camomile with lots of sugar in it . The infirmary becomes a kind of paradise in your mind . I was like that ; and , naturally , the first time I caught cold I coughed much more than was called for . And I awoke in the infirmary to the sound of the bell ringing for the others . But that bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wraith . It rang out the passing of living hours ? hours of class with its austerity , of playtime with its tumult , of the refectory with its warmth . For those who were alive , who were not , like me , in the infirmary , it sounded the realities of an enviable existence filled with jubilations , disappointments , severities , triumphs . And I lay robbed , forgotten , sick of insipid camomiles , of the sweaty bed , the blank hours . Nothing comes of a sortie you have got out of . Of course there are days like this one when a sortie brings no satisfaction . It is too evident that we are playing a game that we call war . We are playing Cops and Robbers . We are abiding scrupulously by the rules of conduct prescribed by the history books and the rules of tactics prescribed by the war manuals . Last night , for example , I drove up to the aerodrome in a motorcar . The sentry , obedient to the rules , presented his bayonet . My car might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing at presenting bayonets to German tanks . But the tanks are playing their own game . How can we possibly be enthusiastic about these grim charades , in which we play the part of supernumeraries , when we are asked to play on till we are killed ? Death is a bit too serious for a charade . Who could dress with excitement for such a part ? Nobody . Even Hochede , who is a sort of saint , a man who has reached that state of permanent grace which surely is the final consummation of man ? even Hochede took refuge in silence . All of us dressed in silence , grumpily ? and not because we were heroically modest . That grumpiness concealed no inner exaltation . It told its own story . And I knew what it meant . It was the grumpiness of an agent whois mystified by the instructions of an absentee owner , yet remains faithful to him . All of us longed for our quiet rooms , but there was not one who would really have chosen to go to bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hope of enthusiasm in defeat . The important thing is to dress , to climb aboard , and to take off . What we ourselves think of the procedure is of no importance . A little boy in school enthusiastic about his grammar lesson would seem to me a little prig not to be trusted . The important thing is to strive towards a goal which is not immediately visible . That goal is not the concern of the mind , but of the spirit . The spirit knows how to love , but it is asleep . Talk to me about temptation ! I know as much about temptation as any Church Father . To be tempted is to be tempted , when the spirit is asleep , to give in to the reasons of the mind . What do I accomplish by risking my life in this mountain avalanche ? I have no notion . Time and again people would say to me , ' I can arrange to have you transferred here or there . That is where you belong . You will be more useful there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilots by the thousand ! Whereas you ? ' No question but that they were right . My mind agreed with them , but my instinct always prevailed over my mind . Why was it that their reasoning never convinced me , even though I had no argument with which to defeat it ? I would say to myself , The intellectuals are kept in reserve on the shelves of the Propaganda Ministry , like pots of jam to be eaten when the war is over . ' Hardly an argument , I agree ! Once again , like every other member of the Group , I have taken off in the face of every good reason , every obvious argument , every intellectual reflex . The moment will come when I shall know that it was reasonable to fight against reason . I have promised myself that if I am alive I shall walk alone on the highway that runs through our village . Then perhaps I shall dwell at last in my own self . And I shall see . It may be that I shall have nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to me beautiful , I have no words to say so . I see her smile , and that is all . Intellectuals take her face apart and explain it bit by bit . They do not see that smile . To know is not to prove , nor to explain . It is to accede to vision . But if we are to have vision we must learn to participate in the object of the vision . The apprenticeship is hard . All day long my village was invisible to me . Before the sortie I saw in it nothing but mud walls and peasants more or less grimy . Now it is a handful of gravel thirty-three thousand feet below me . That is my village . But tonight , it may be , a watchdog will waken and bark . I have always loved the enchantment of a village dreaming aloud , by the voice of a single watchdog , in the fair night . I do not ask to be understood . All that I ask is a vision of my village tidied for sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its customs . To see its peasants , home from the fields , their evening meal eaten and their table cleared , their children put to bed and their lamp blown out , dissolved into the silent night . And nothing more ? unless perhaps , under the stiff white sheets of the countryside , the slow pulsing of their breathing , like the subsidence of a swell after a storm at sea . God suspends the use of things and speech for the period of the nocturnal balance sheet . By the play of that irresistible slumber which loosens the fingers until morning , men will appear in my vision with open hands . And then perhaps I shall win a glimpse of that which has no name . I shall walk like the blind whose palms lead them towards the flame in the hearth . The blind can not describe the flame , yet they havefound it . Thus perhaps shall I see what it is in that dark village that we must die to protect ? that which is unseen , yet , like an ember beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sortie you have got out of . If we are to understand a thing as simple as a village , you must first Captain ! ' Yes ? ' Six German fighters on the port bow . ' The words rang in my ears like a thunderclap . You must first . . . You must first . . . Ah ! I do want very much to be paid off in time . I do want to have the right to love . I do want to win a glimpse of the being for whom I die . VII Gunner ! ' Sir ? ' D' you hear the lieutenant ? Six German fighters . Six , on the port bow . ' I heard the lieutenant , sir . ' Dutertre ! Have they seen us ? ' They have , Captain . Banking towards us . Fifteen hundred feet below us . ' Hear that , gunner ? Fifteen hundred feet below us . Dutertre ! How near are they ? ' Say ten seconds . ' Hear that , gunner ? On our tail in a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tiny . A swarm of poisonous wasps . Gunner ! They 're crossing broadside . You 'll see them in a second . There ! ' Do n't see them yet , sir . . . . Yes , I do ! ' ( I do n't see them now myself . ) They after us ? ' After us , sir . ' Rising fast . ' Ca n't say , sir . Do n't think so . . . . No , sir . ' Dutertre spoke . What do you say , Captain ? ' What do you expect me to say ? ' Nobody said anything . There was nothing to say . It was in God 's hands . If I banked , I should narrow the space between us . Luckily , we were flying straight into the sun . At high altitude it is impossible to go up fifteen hundred feet higher without giving a couple of miles to your game . It was not impossible , therefore , that they might lose us entirely in the sun by the time they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , gunner ? ' Still after us , sir . ' ' We gaining on them ? ' Well , sir . No . . . . Perhaps . ' It was God 's business ? and the sun 's . Fighters do not fight , they murder . Still , it might turn into a fight , and I made ready for it . I pressed with both feet as hard as I could , trying to free the frozen rudder . A wave of something strange went over me . But my eyes were still on the Germans , and I bore with all my weight down upon the rigid bar . Once again I discovered that I was in fact much less upset in this moment of action ? if ' action ' was the word for this vain expectancy ? than I had been while dressing . A kind of anger was going through me ? a beneficent anger . God knows , no ecstasy of sacrifice ; rather an urge to bite hard into something . ' Gunner ! Are we losing them ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Dutertre ! ' ' Captain ? ' ' I . . . nothing . ' ' Anything the matter ? ' Nothing . I thought . . . Nothing . ' I decided not to mention it . No good worrying them . If I went into a dive they would know it soon enough . It was not natural that I should be running with sweat in a temperature fifty degrees below freezing . Not natural . I knew perfectly well what was happening . Gently , very gently , I was fainting . I could see the instrument panel . Now I could n't . My hands were losing theirgrip on the wheel . I had n't even the strength to speak . I was letting myself go . So pleasant , letting oneself go . . . . Then I squeezed the rubber tube . A gust of air blew into my nose and brought me life . The oxygen supply was not out of order ! Then it must be . . . Of course ! How stupid I had been ! It was the rudder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up a grand piano . Flying thirty-three thousand feet in the air , I had struggled like a professional wrestler . The oxygen was being doled out to me . It was my business to use it up economically . I was paying for my orgy . I began to inhale in swift repeated gasps . My heart beat faster and faster . It was like a faint tinkle . What good would it do to speak of it ? If I went into a dive , they would know soon enough . Now I could see my instrument panel . . . . No , that was n't true . I could n't see it . Sitting there in my sweat , I was sad . Life came back as gently as it had flowed out of me . Dutertre ! ' ' Captain ? ' I should have liked to tell him what had happened . ' I . . . I thought . . . No . ' I gave it up . Words consume oxygen too fast . Already I was out of breath . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to say something , Captain ? ' No . . . . Nothing . ' Quite sure , Captain ? You puzzle me . ' I puzzle him . But I am alive . ' We arc alive . ' ' Well , sir , for the time being . ' For the time being . There was still Arras . Thus for a minute or two I had the feeling that I should not pull through ; and yet I had not observed in myself that poignant anxiety which , people say , turns the hair white in an instant . I began to think of Sagon , of what Sagon had said when , two months earlier , we had gone to see him only a few hours after he had been shot down behind our own lines ? what had gone through his mind when the German fighters had surrounded him and nailed him to the stake , as it were . VIII I see him exactly as he was , lying in the hospital bed . His knee had been hooked and broken by the tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump , but Sagon had not felt the shock . His face and hands were rather badly burnt , but all in all Sagon 's condition was not alarming . Slowly and in a matter-of-fact voice , as if reporting a bit of fatigue duty , he told us his story . I knew they had got me when I saw the air filled with tracer bullets round my plane . My instrument board was shot to bits . Then I saw a puff of smoke forward . It was n't much , you know . I thought it must be . . you know . . . there 's a connecting pipe . There was n't much flame . ' He stopped , and his lower lip came forward while he turned it over in his mind . It seemed to him important to be able to tell us whether the flames were high or were not high . He hesitated . But still , flame is flame . The intercom was working , and I told them they 'd better jump . ' In less than ten seconds a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my escape hatch . I should n't have done that . It let in the air . . . and the flame , you know . . . . I was sorry I 'd done it . ' You have a locomotive boiler spitting a torrent of flame at you , twenty thousand feet in the air , and you are sorry you 've done something . I shall not play Sagon false by talking of his heroism or his modesty . He would not recognize himself in these terms . He would insist that he was sorry he had done it . As westood round his bed it was plain that he was making a concentrated effort to be precise . The field of consciousness is tiny . It accepts only one problem at a time . Get into a fist fight , put your mind on the strategy of the fight , and you will not feel the other fellow 's punches . Once , when I thought I was about to drown in a seaplane accident , the freezing water seemed to me tepid . Or , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the water . In the same way , Sagon 's consciousness was filled to the brim with the problem of getting away from the plane . His universe was limited successively to the fate of his crew , the handle that governed the sliding hatch , the rip cord of the parachute . The intercom seemed to be working . Are you there ? ' he had called out . No answer . Nobody on board ? ' he had asked again . No answer . They must have jumped , Sagon had decided . And as he was sorry about those flames ( his hands and face were already burnt ) he had got out of his seat , climbed out on the fuselage , and crawled along the surface of the wing . ' I peered in . I could n't see the observer . ' The observer , killed instantly by the German fighters , had slumped down out of sight . Then I backed up and looked for the gunner . I could n't see him , either . ' But the same thing had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped . ' Once again Sagon turned the matter over in his mind . ' If I had known , I could have crawled back into the cockpit . The flames were not so high . I lay there on the wing , I do n't know how long . I had stabilized the plane at an angle before crawling out . The going was smooth , the wind was bearable , and I felt fairly comfortable . I must have been out on that wing for some time . I did n't know what to do . ' Not that Sagon had been faced with insoluble problems . He thought himself alone on board . The plane was burning . The fighters were still after it and spattering it with bullets . What Sagon was telling us was that he had felt no desire of any kind . He had felt nothing . He had time on his hands . He was floating in a sort of infinite leisure . And point by point I recognized the extraordinary sensation that now and then accompanies the imminence of death  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture-book notion of breathless haste . Sagon had lain there on his wing , a creature flung out of the dimension of time . ' And then , ' he said , ' I jumped . I made a bad job of it . I could feel myself twisting in the air and hesitated to pull the cord , thinking I might get tangled up in the ' chute . I waited until I had straightened out . I waited quite a long time . ' What Sagon really remembered of his whole mishap , from beginning to end , was waiting . Waiting for the flames to rise higher . Then waiting on the wing for heaven knows what . And finally , falling freely through the air , still waiting . This was Sagon himself who was doing these things ? actually , a Sagon more rudimentary , more simple than the Sagon I know ; a Sagon a little perplexed , bored , and slightly impatient as he felt himself drop into an abyss . Ix We had been living two hours at the centre of an external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being gradually used up . We hardly exchanged a word . Once or twice , very cautiously , I tried to work my rudder . Iwas not obstinate about it . Each time the same sensation , the same feeling of a gentle exhaustion , had come over me . Dutertre , at work with his camera , always let me know in plenty of time when his photography required that I bank . I would do the best I could with such control of the wheel as was still left to me . I would tilt the plane and pull towards me ; and in a dozen or twenty separate efforts I would set her where Dutertre wanted her . Altitude ? ' ' Thirty-three thousand seven . ' I was still thinking of Sagon . Man is always himself . In myself I have never met another than myself . Sagon knew only Sagon . He who dies , dies as he was . In the death of an ordinary miner , it is an ordinary miner who dies . Where is it to be found ? that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I found myself once half drowned in a seaplane . The ship was a prototype I was testing , and one of her pontoons had come unriveted when I set her down at sea . Somebody seemed to trip me up , I was jolted out of my seat , and I came to , fifteen or twenty feet under water , in a sunken cockpit , bumping against metal objects in total darkness . I held my breath and felt round for the escape hatch . I was in a hurry , but I had no feeling of panic . Then , unable to get out , I was forced to resign myseli to the thought of drowning ; but still I felt nothing specific except a kind of remorse , because out there in the world I was expected back . I was myself astonished at my state of mind . ' How simple it is " I said to myself . For in imagination I had always shuddered at the thought of drowning . The metal , the water , the darkness , I had imagined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him fifty seconds to defeat them ; and the emergency , working like a press , draws forth from him a being of an unknown essence . It was the thought of that phantom deleted material 4 THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY trade , in time of war . And everyone knows what war looks like . Handsome horsemen transmit the orders ? or rather , to Inc modern about it , motorcyclists . The orders ordain events , change the face of the world . The handsome horsemen are like the stars ? they bring tidings of the future . In the midst of turmoil and despair , orders arrive , flung to the troops from the backs of steaming horses . And then all is well ? at least , so says the blueprint of war . So says the pretty picture-book of war . Everybody st niggles as hard as he can to make war look like tear ? piously respects the rules of the game , so that war may perhaps be good enough to agree to look like war . Orders are given for the sacrifice of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . And nobody admits meanwhile that this war looks like nothing at all ; I lull no part of it makes sense ; that not a single blueprint . fits the circumstances ; that the puppets have been cut free of the strings that continue to be pulled . In all seriousness the Staffs ask not for intelligence impossible to provide . But the air arm can not undertake to explain war to the Staffs . The air arm might be able to test or verify the Staffs ' hypotheses . But there are no longer any hypotheses . Fifty reconnaissance crews are asked to sketch the face of a war that has no face . The Staffs appeal to us as if we were a tribe of fortunetellers . While Alias was speaking I threw a glance at Dutertre , my observer . This was what he said afterwards . ' What do they take us for , sending us of on kw-altitude sorties : Only yesterday I had to tick off a colonel from division headquarters who was talking the same rot . " Will you tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell one how I am going to report the enemy 's position to you from an altitude of fifty feet when I 'm doing three hundred miles an hour ? " Ilelooked at me as if I 19 , re the one who was mad , " Why , " he said , " that 's easy . You can tell according to whether they shoot or not . If they shoot at you , the positions are German . " Imagine ! The bloody fool ! ' What Dutertre knew , and the colonel seemed not to know , was that the French army never saw French aeroplanes . We had roughly one thousand planes scattered between Dunkerque and Alsace . Diluted in infinity , so far as the men on the ground were concerned . The result was that When a plane roared across our lines it WIN virtually certain to be a German . You let fly with all the anti-aircraft stuff you had even before you saw hint , the instant you heard him ; for otherwise he had dropped his bombs and was off before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence we 'll bring home working this way ! ' Dutertre said . Of course they take our intelligence into account , since the blueprint of war requires that intelligence officers make use of intelligence . But even their warby-the-blueprint had broken down . We ! mew perfectly well that they would never be able to make use of our intelligence  --  luckily . It might be brought back by us ; but it would never be transmitted to the Staff , The roads would be jammed . The telephone lines would be cut . The Staff would have moved in a hurry . The really important intelligence the ere ny 's position ? would have been furnished by the enemy himself . For example : A few days earlier we of Group - 33 , having been pushed back in successive stages to the vicinity of Loon , were . wondering how near the front might now Inc ? how soon we should be forced to move again . Lieutenant Marais was sent off as liaison officer between the Group and the general in command , who was seven miles away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marois 's motorcar had run up against a : . team roller behind which two armored curs were hidden . 11Iarois made a U-turn and started away , ' Alt a blast of machine-gun lire killed him instantly and wounded his chauffeur . The armored ears were German . We telephoned to the general that the Germans held t he road at a point halfway between inns and its and begged permission to move . And by a strenuous effort we were able in two hours to evacuate our planes , lorries , motorcars , files , spare parts , and personnel . The General Staff was like a first-rat e bridge player who is asked by someone sitting in a game in the next room , ' What do you think I ought to do with the queen of spades ? ' How can the expert , knowing nothing of that particular game , have an opinion about that queen of spades ? Actually , a General Staff has no right to be without an opinion . Besides , to long as certain elements are still in ads hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise it will lose its esaurol over them . The opponent will murk a squeeze play . Thus , the General must take risks . So long as there is a war on , it must act , even though it net blindly . But it is , nevertheless , very hard to say what shall be done with the of spades when you have n't a hand in the game . What we had learned , meanwhile , ? at first with surprise . and then with the feeling That we ought . to have seen it coming , ? ? was that ruler the cracking up begins , the machine stops running . There is no soldiering for the soldier to do . You might . think that in retreat and disaster there ought to be such is flood pressing problems that one could hardly decide which to tackle first . You might think that we of the French army merely lacked the artillery , the tanks , the aeroplanes necessary for the solution of our problems . But what you do not how , or what en er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problems themsels-es . I mean by this that the problems were not Itnolvn . Vital is one to do with a queen of spades that is not part of any known game ? Of cour. , e when your country is fast collapsing , and you still hold the queen of spades , it is morally impossible not to play the card . You hold it back ; you hesitate ; you rack your brains to find use for it ? and then you fling it desperately darn on the chance that it may take in ( " ommonly , people believe that defeat is characterized by c general bustle and is feverish rush . Bustle and rush are the signs of victory , not of defeat . Victory is a thing of a ? lion . It is a house in the act of being built .
