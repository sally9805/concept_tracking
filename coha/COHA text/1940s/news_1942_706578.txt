txt Nature is on the side of the utility companies right now , putting them in a good position to meet wartime demands for electricity . It 's a matter of rainfall . This year there has been plenty of it . in those areas which depend in good part on hydro-electric systems for their production of electricity . Almost onethird of this country 's output is by this method : the rest is by steam A year ago key areas were hard hit by the drought . Hydro-electric plants were restricted in their production : in some cases nearby steam plants had to pinch hit . A power shortage developed in the Tennessee Valley and minor rationing was needed . Today the situation is reversed Most of the nation 's storage systems are 100 ? 2ri better off than they were a year ago . Today 's excellent water conditions not only help to assure adequate power . They ease the transportation problem . since less coal must be shipped to plants producing electricity by steam . They benefit the utility companies , too . by reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government in taxes . They lessen concern over delays in the delivery of new generating equipment , by enabling all presently installed equipment to be fully used . Manufacture of electricity by hydro plants and by steam plants is similar . Chief difference is that one employs nature  --  water from rainfalls  --  while the ( ) the/ burns , coal to produce steam . In the hydro plant the weight and volume of dammed up water rushing into a turbine . which is something like a hollow drive shaft , forces itself against numerous blades set in the turbine and causes it to revolve at high speed . The turbine is attached to an electric generator. which turns out the electricity . In the other type plant steam is driven at terrific pressure through the turbines , to produce the same result . If there is n't enough rainfall the supply of water in the reservoirs and - streams falls too low to provide sufficient force to generate the electricity desired . But right now there 's plenty ? all over the country . Pacific Northwest %%ater Plentiful The Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year . now has more than enough water for full operation of existing hydro-electric plants . No shortage is expected , there have been ample rains recently . Interconnection with steam plants in Utah and with facilities in Oregon enabled this section to get over a difficult spot last summer . Operation of all fuel plants and purchase of steam power frrrn Puget Sound Power &; Light did a similtir job for Washington Water Power . This company 's main worry , however , was not to meet the immediate power demand . but to save as much water as possible for the fall in the event it was confronted with a dry period then , after a dry spring and summer . Fears were groundle .. , however , because a very wet fall and winter materialized . A year ago the Tennessee Valley area drew upon every source available for electricity to relieve the tightest power situation ever seen : n that territory Today it is sending power northward . A year ago street lighting was curtailed . store and sign lighting restricted temporarily and great concern was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the T V.A . area soliciting the cooperation of all in the conservation of electricity . In Minnesota where hydro-power is used in heavy iron ore operations in the famous Mesabi and Cayuna ranges , water is rushing freely over the spillways More than of the country 's non ore production of 103.5 million tons came from that district last year . In the southern interconnected system of the Commonwealth &; Southern Corp . dominated by operations of Alabama Power Co. and Georgia Power Co. and extending into Mississippi . South Carolina and Florida , water conditions are much bettci than normal for this time of the year , thanks to recent heavy rains . These companies operate a chain of hydro electric plants on the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers in Alabama and on the Chattahoochee , Tallulah , Tugalo and Savannah rivers in Georgia In Georgia there are 21 hydro plants with a combined capacity of 284,300 kilowatts . Alabama Power has six hydro projects aggregating 414,500 kilowatts The combined plants had enough water in storage , it is estimated , to produce more than 450 million kilowatt hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be around 400 million . Last year at this time they were in critical shape with all fuel-burning plants being pressed into operation . The system has another ace in the hole this year in an additional 140,000 kilowatts of new steam generating plants which are operating at full schedule . Texas . Worries About Floods Texas areas that were parched last year now worry about floods . At Elephant Butte on the Rio Grande a federal irrigation and power project has its reservoir filled to overflowing for the first time since its completion in 1940 . There is enough water in storage now , it is estimated , to handle the irrigation requirements for the next two years . Only two years ago the cotton crop in the area was threatened by a drought Niagara Hudson Power System in upper New York State has a vast hydro-electric network comprising some 980,000 kilowatts of generating capacity . It , too , reports a great change in water conditions over that which existed last year . From a severe drought status water conditions in the area have returned to much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement has been sufficient to permit the system to release uneconomic steam plants from operation and at the same time withdraw other steam plants for overhauling A year ago , In that area wells were going dry and farmers were carrying water for their cattle . The Sacandaga Reservoir  --  about 20 miles west of Glens Falls , N. Y : ? Is at about 84% of capacity , against 44% lasC year . That impounding reservoir is fed by the Sacandaga River system and is regulated by a state board to control the flow of the Hudson River . The Stillwater Reservoir in Herkimer County , also in New York . is fed by small creeks and lakes in the western Adirondacks It is 98% full . against 56% last year . The Hinckly Reservoir in Herkimer County . about 20 miles northeast of Utica on Canada Creek , is about 97% full , against 51% last year . A somewhat similar experience is obtaining in the territory of the American Gas &; Electric Co. system . It has around 190.000 kilowatts of hydro facilities , mostly on small rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 1.500.000 kilowatts of generating capacity . Water conditions in its hydro area are definitely better than normal . At the present time . water plants are producing about five times as much electricity as they did last year . Ample water for hydro also has permitted the system to drop off high-cost fuel plants and overhaul others . The New England Power Association also reports excellent water conditions . Beginning in March of this year . improved water conditions have increased the output of its hydroelectric plants well above a year ago . Its storage reservoirs on both the Connecticut and Deerfield rivers are nearly at capacity levels . The Central Maine Power Co reports full storage reservoirs . with the natural flow of the Kennebeck and Androscoggin rivers  --  the two largest in Maine  --  more than enough to operate the system plants Last year the reservoirs on these rivers were only about twothirds full .
