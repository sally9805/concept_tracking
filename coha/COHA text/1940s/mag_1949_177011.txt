Last week a militant group of U.S. clergymen and laymen met in Washington and set out to raise $1,000,000 " to resist the declared purposes of the Roman Catholic Church further to breach the wall of separation between church and state . " <P> The organization , called Protestants and Other Americans United ( for the Separation of Church and State ) , was holding its first big meeting since its founding a year ago ( TIME , Jan. 19 , 1948 ) . Main purpose of the conference was to launch a nationwide drive for members , with pamphlets , radio broadcasts and mass meetings scheduled for Atlanta , Cincinnati , St. Louis and other cities . <P> The windup of the program , a rally in Constitution Hall , drew a near-capacity crowd of 3,600 . Speakers bore down heavily on Catholics who want state support for church schools . Said Methodist Bishop G. Bromley Oxnam : " One of the most important bastions of the fortress of religious liberty is the American principle of the separation of church and state . A full-scale attack upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church . . . The Roman Catholic Church does not believe in the separation of church and state . . . The question of public support for parochial education does raise the issue . . . Protestants and Other Americans United . . . has not been organized for the purpose of attacking the Roman Catholic Church or any other . It has been organized to maintain religious liberty . . . We are convinced that there are literally millions of American Roman Catholics who are gravely concerned by policies of the hierarchy to establish here a culture alien to the traditions of a free people . " <P> P.O.A.U. 's new executive director , Dr. Glenn L. Archer , former dean of the Law School of Kansas ' Washburn University , was encouraged by the success of last week 's meeting . In an " Address to All Americans , " his organization declared that recent events " have aroused a substantial body of public opinion to the danger that threatens religious liberty as guaranteed by the separation of church and state . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welfare Conference and signed by American cardinals , archbishops and bishops , the hierarchy brands the separation of church and state a ' shibboleth of doctrinaire secularists ' and serves notice that it intends ' peaceably , patiently and perseveringly ' to effect a radical change in this American tradition and in the law which supports it . " <P> After the P.O.A.U. conference ended , a Roman Catholic spokesman made a fast reply . Said Msgr . John Spence , director of education for the Washington ( D.C. ) archdiocese , in answer to Bishop Oxnam 's speech : <P> " No attack whatever has been launched by the Roman Catholic Church on this constitutional principle embodied in the First Amendment . We are not assaulting any constitutional principle when we ask that public and parochial school children of all denominations be included in Government-initiated public welfare programs . The United States Supreme Court , in the Everson decision , established the constitutionality of free bus rides for all children . It is not conceivable that anyone would challenge the constitutionality of health services . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
