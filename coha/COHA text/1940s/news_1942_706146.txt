txt Closet As Air Raid Shelter In my living room about twelve feet from the windows is a door leading to a good-sized closet . It has occurred to me that in the event of an air raid , I would be better protected from flying glass by going into this closet , leaving the door slightly ajar , than I would be lying face down on the floor in the middle of the room as has been suggested . This is my own idea , so undoubtedly there is something wrong with it . But if it has any merit , I am airing it because I know that many apartments in the city have spacious closets wherein a person could even lie flat on the floor . I offer this suggestion merely as a protection against flying glass . In my own case , I know that if a bomb ever struck my apartment building there would be little chance of its survival because it is a two-story structure . STELLA ROSE .
