Everybody said that San Francisco made progress . But how much and what kind of progress , from where to where ? Was the charter just Dumbarton Oaks festooned with a Spanish moss of phrases ? Or did it bring the world nearer to genuine world government ? <P> Only 25% of the San Francisco charter was picked up from the Big Powers ' original Dumbarton Oaks draft . That 25% was still the backbone of the charter and of the new United Nations organization . But-the changes were many and important . Mostly they came in stating the purposes and principles of the organization and in the " curative " functions designed to deal with the underlying causes of war . In these provisions , the charter represented real progress toward real internationalism . <P> Which Is the Scenery ? Big Power dominance was still intact . People primarily concerned with this fact looked upon such subsidiaries as the Economic and Social Council and such provisions as the statement of purposes and principles as mere window-dressing . But they were more than that . <P> By building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations in time might be able to alter a world environment which , unaltered , would not permit any world organization to function effectively . Said one of the U.S. delegation 's hopeful consultants : <P> " Obviously the enforcement machinery wo n't work in the cases where it will be needed most-disputes between the great powers . The Security Council , the joint military staffs , are just so much scenery . The real guts of this charter are in the parts which attempt to set up constructive goals toward which all the powers can strive together . The Security Council is defective because in it power is too concentrated . The General Assembly is defective because El Salvador and Liberia are unrealistically given as many votes as the U.S. and Great Britain . These defects wo n't be remedied unless the world changes enough to make major improvements possible . And the world wo n't change unless the curative provisions of the present charter are used to bring about the change . " <P> " We , the Peoples . " Dumbarton Oaks had no preamble at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charter has a preamble which is loaded with principled phrases ( see above ) . Perhaps cynics who scorned the affirmations of faith in tolerance , freedom , equality , hu man dignity and better standards of life forgot that whole economic and social programs had been based upon an equally vague phrase in the U.S. Constitution : " to promote the general welfare . " The section on purposes and principles , greatly strengthened , declares one of the organization 's purposes to be the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all , " without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion . " But this section contains a serious res ervation : except where an actual breach of international peace has occurred or is imminent , the United Nations may not intervene in matters " essentially within the domestic jurisdiction " of a member nation . <P> At the Roots . The charter recognizes that " conditions of stability and well-being are . . . necessary for peaceful and friendly relations among nations " and takes a measure of responsibility for creating such conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
