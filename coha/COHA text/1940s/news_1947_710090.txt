txt WASHINGTON , Jan. ** Joseph H. Ball , Republican , of Minnesota , proposed today a prohibition on industry-wide bargaining by cutting off the authority of international unions over their local unions . The ' effect , he said , would be the prevention of industry-wide strikes . A bill which he introduced would limit negotiations in any industry or activity to one labor-market area , except where an employer had plants in several areas . In soft coal , for instance , the United Mine Workers could not set a general wage policy for the industry , except in a purely advisory sense . UMW local unions in the Pittsburgh area would conduct the bargaining with the coal companies in that area . These local unions could disregard the international union 's wage policy . If the international union attempted to coerce the locals it would become the Government 's duty to ask the courts for an injunction . Violation of such an injunction , of course , would risk all the penalties of contempt . No employer could delegate his bargaining authority to another employer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could negotiate one contract covering all his employed ' without regard to area boundaries . In such cases , where an employer 's plants were spread among several labormarket areas , , the union could lawfully set up autonomous divisions representing the appropriate group of local unions , The bill would not apply to // deleted 13 lines I do n't think it will decrease the aggregate power of locals one iota . " The Minnesotan said that the international union ? could have a strike fund and pay strike benefits but could not use such money to impose a policy on a local union . The withholding of strike benefits for coercive purposes , for example , would be unlawful , he stated . Asked about the case of a " wildcat " ( unauthorized ) strike , Senator Ball said the local union was the body to determine whether a stoppage was a " wildcat " strike . International Could " Advise " He acknowledged that under inch a law an international union would tend to become a sort of trade association comparable to the National Association of Manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could advise but could not dictate to its constituents , according to the Senator . The general purport of the bill is outlined in the following preamble : " That in order to assure to employes in industries affecting commerce a direct voice in determining the terms and conditions of their work through collective bargaining with their employers , and in order to prevent monopolistic concentration of bargaining power and controls over labor supply which may obstruct and burden commerce and endanger the national health and welfare by industry-wide shutdowns , it is hereby declared to be the policy of the United States that the right and authority of two or more employers and their employes to bargain collectively to determine the terms and conditions of employment of such employes should be confined to geographical areas small enough so that all employes and employers concerned will be able to participate directly in the determination of bargaining policies and so that monopolistic practices dangerous to the public health and welfare and threatening industry-wide stoppages in the supp1S , of products and services will be prevented . " NLRA Would Be Changed An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no labor organization shall be a representative for purposes of collective bargaining of any employes of an employer if such labor organization also acts as the representative for purposes of collective bargaining of employes of any other employer engaged in the same industry or activity , unless the principal places of employment of the employes of such employers are located within the same labormarket. area . " . While local unions would be prohibited from conspiring to seek identical terms in their contracts , there is ? no specific prohibition in the bill against employers agreeing to limit their concessions . Asked about that , Senator Ball said : " That may be an omission , in which case I 'd want to take care of it " He said he thought the anti-trust laws might prohibit such an agreement . If the proposed decentralization of bargaining to the area level gives the individual worker a greater voice in the bargaining , the Senator was asked , why was not it a logical next step to limit the bargaining to an ? individual worker . Senator Ball said such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long Study He said that in countering a monopoly of the labor supply in an industry there were two alternatives , regulating the monopoly or breaking it up . He said that he did a lot of studying off the subject , and " this is the soundest and most liberal way I know of " to handle it . He acknowledged that " you ca n't pass any law that will cure these situations overnight . " " But I think this will arrest the trend , " he stated . " Certainly John L. Lewis would not be an absolute dictator under this bill . " Asked whether some local unions would not be put at a disadvantage by a loss of bargaining skills and other resources if they were isolated from the international , Senator Ball said some employers would face a similar disadvantage . LOCAL BARGAINING PROPOSED BY BALL // branches of the transportation industry which are subject to the Railway Labor Act . Senator Ball told newsmen that the bill " does n't take any power away from unions , as such . " " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any contract negotiated locally would be unlawful under the Ball bill . Senator Ball also expressed the vidual worker is concerned , it strengthens his bargaining power from the international to the local , which is closer to the members , " he added . He said : " As far as the indigroups were pricing themselves out of the market . He cited building construction wages as an example . He also said he thought the antitrust laws governing business had been " very effective . " Asked what he thought of the bill 's chances of success , the Senator said : " It is hard to tell . I just introduced it . " Democratic Senators introduced bills today to raise the statutory ' minimum wage to 75 cents an hour and to create a temporary labor relations commission to make a study and recommendations as proposed by President Truman in his message on the State of the Union this week . Aim to Expand Pay Coverage The wage bill was sponsored by Senators James E. Murray of Montana , Elbert D. Thomas of Utah and Claude Pepper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wages and Hours Law to seamen and to industries processing agricultural , horticultural , or fish products . The bill to create a commission was sponsored by Senators Robert F. Wagner of New York , Theodore F. Green and J. Howard of Rhode Island , Glen H. Taylor of Idaho , Francis J. Myers of Pennsylvania , and Messrs . Murray , Thomas and Pepper . Representative Clare E. Hoffman , Republican , of Michigan , in troduced a bill to repeal the Wagner Act and to set up a Mediation Board with authority to order a strike deferred for six months if it would affect the public health , welfare and safety . The Federal courts would be empowered to make Any order or judgment necessary to promote industrial harmony . Meanwhile the CIO voiced its opposition to plans of Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio and Representative Fred A. Hartley Jr . of New Jersey to dispense with hearings by the Senate and House Labor Committees on " labor legislation along the lines of last year 's Case bill . " Nathan Cowan , CIO legislative director , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee chairmen , contesting arguments that further hearings were unnecessary because of previous extensive committee hearings . " Lack " of House Hearing Cited " This line of reasoning is not borne out by the facts in the case , " Mr. Cowan wrote . " In the House of Representatives there were no Labor Committee hearings at all on the Case bill . This bill was not even introduced until after the House Labor Committee had reported a bill to the House Rules Committee , following hearings on bills which embodied President Truman 's proposals for fact-finding and cooling-off periods in labor disputes . " The Rules Committee proceeded to substitute the newly introduced Case bill for the bill resorted by the House Labor Committee , and the House of Representatives voted on it without affording any interested groups an opportunity to present their views in public hearings . tin the Senate the Education and Labor Committee had in the meantime been holding hearings on a fact-finding , cooling-off bill similar to the one considered in .. he House Labor Committee and on other bills dealing with organized labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hatch . After the- Case bill passed the House , the Senate committee devoted a few hearings to its specific provisions , but refused a huge volume of requests to be heard , and gave nothing approaching the full consideration required by bill of that character .
