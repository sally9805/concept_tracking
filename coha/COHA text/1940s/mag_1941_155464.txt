Both the great democratic governments , after much huffing &; puffing , have recognized a big sociological fact of World War II : that labor must be a full partner with industry in preparing for war and winning it. * <P> Last week , when 80-odd White House correspondents filed into the President 's office , they knew what his chief subject would be : his reorganization order giving a head to the defense organization and delegating to it the powers that his National Defense Advisory Commission sadly lacked : power to act instead of to advise , to decide without running to the President for his ruling . What would he do with labor ? Could he find a single man who would have the confidence both of Henry Ford and Roland Jay Thomas of the United Auto Workers ? Would a labor man or a management man be tsar of defense ? Only a couple of days before , Britain 's Minister of Labor and National Service , Ernest Bevin , had been put in charge of all war production . It might happen here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at its usual 30 angle , the President gave his answer . Grinning a tired grin , he picked up his reorganization order , whisked through it swiftly . <P> As he had announced a month ago , the order set up a four-man board-the Office of Production Management-to direct the defense program . The board would consist of a Director General ( Knudsen ) , Associate Director General ( Hillman ) , the Secretaries of Navy and War . The board would have all the power the President could give to survey , formulate and execute for national-defense production . " The Director General in association with the Associate Director General " would do the administrative job , subject to the " yes " or " no " of the President . <P> Within the office of OPM would be at least three divisions-Production , headed by Glassman John David Biggers ; Purchases , bossed by Sears , Roebuck 's Donald Marr Nelson ; Priorities , bossed by Steelman Edward Reilly Stettinius Jr . The President paused , blew out a cloud of cigaret smoke . The questions popped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of OPM-or Mr. Hillman ? " <P> Franklin Roosevelt grinned . Both of them . Incredulous , someone asked the question again . The President tried for an analogy . Knudsen &; Hillman should be considered like a firm-like that famous law firm of Roosevelt &; O'Connor . You went to Roosevelt and O'Connor . And you 'd go to Knudsen and Hillman . If a conflict over policy should arise , Knudsen &; Hillman could always consult the President . But it was silly to worry about disputes between them . Even over a labor question-say , Ford Motor Co. contracts ? Yes , silly . The head man of national defense in the U. S. , the President said , was a fellow named Knudsenhillman.
