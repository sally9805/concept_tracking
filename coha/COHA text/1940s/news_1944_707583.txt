txt With the expected German counteroffensive against the Allied beachheads in the Nettuno-Anzio region now under way , the battle of Rome is apparently entering into its crucial stage . Heavy fighting is raging along the whole periphery of the Allied zone , only fourteen miles long and an average of eight miles deep , against which the . Germans are hurling strong forces assembled both from the Gustav Line farther south and from their occupation troops in the north . The indications are that this is not merely a holding attack but a determined effort to wipe out the Allied bridgehead and to throw the Allied landing forces back into the sea before the Allies can break through the Gustav Line and move up their whole front to the Rome area . There can be no doubt that a German success in this region would be a major triumph for Hitler and a boost to Germany 's sinking morale . For the Nettuno-Anzio landings , like those of Salerno , are necessarily something of a dress rehearsal for the far bigger invasion now being prepared from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically strengthen Germany 's faith in her ability to repel the latter . And such a demonstration of German strength is especially vital to Hitler at this moment , when the German lines are crumbling before the Russian assaults and when Goebbels is forced to explain reverses in the east by announcing a , shift of German forces to the west . For Germany , therefore , the stake in this battle is greater even than the continued possession of Rome . This stake would explain why , according to some reports , Field Marshal Rommel , the general who has retained the greatest prestige within Germany , is supposed to have taken charge of this campaign , and why , for the first time on Italian soil , the Germans have thrown into the conflict Himmler 's own armed SS , the Nazi guard which consists of the physically fittest , toughest and most fanatic specimens of the " master race , " who have repeatedly been used in critical situations in Russia . And judging from the official cornmuniqu  --  s and dispatches from the field , the Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north of Aprilia , which had penetrated to within sixteen to eighteen miles of Rome , have been forced to withdraw , and the Allies lines have been " shortened , adjusted and consolidated . " At the same time the Germans are still clinging grimly to Cassino , and an Allied break-through is still to be achieved here . From the Allied standpoint , the campaign froth the beachheads has been somewhat of a mystery , even to the correspondents on the spot . After the brilliant surprise of the landings themselves and the successful establishments of the beachheads , the Allied advance appeared to_the be exceedingly cautious , and the statements of various commanding generals suggested that they preferred to await a German counterattack in their coastline positions . It must be assumed that the men who planned this daring undertaking in the first place are no less calculating in their plans to exploit it , and that they are meeting the German assault on ground of their own choosing . **                  @ @ @
