txt PARIS , Sept. ** his first statement for publication since the resignation of Henry A. Wallace as Secretary of Commerce , Secretary of State Byrnes said tonight that President Truman 's pronouncement on foreign policy last Friday was " most reassuring " since it indicated to the world that United ' States policy would be continuous , whichever party was in power . " The statement by the President that American foreign policy is whole-heartedly supported by him and that he contemplates no change in that policy is most reassuring , " Mr. Byrnes said at a press conference . " The fact is that this policy is a bi-partisan policy , and because it is supported by Democrats and Republicans it gives assurance to the world that regardless of which party is in power , the United States is going to stand by the policy he ( the President ) has followed and is today following .

The Secretary took a fairly optimistic view regarding the fulfillment of this schedule . But he qualified it by saying that if the // Big Four did as they had agreed to do , by trying sincerely to induce all to comply with the new rules , all five pending treaties would be ready for the plenary conference by Oct. 5 . He added that if the Big Four fully supported in the plenary session their own decision to limit speeches , the conference could finish its work by midOctober . Mr. Byrnes went so far as to suggest that  --  contrary to the expectations of the French and others  --  the Big Four actually might complete the treaties in Paris within a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said the Big Four Foreign Ministers had no fixed program after Oct. 15 , but had agreed to take up as many questions as possible . He thought that by Oct. 17 or 18 it would be clear whether the Big Four could get together on the treaties rapidly . He himself thought they should stay in Paris and finish the work ; otherwise the French , British and Russians would have to take to New York staffs of experts who otherwise would not be needed there . Molotov Would Attend Assembly But Mr.- Byrnes conceded that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov had said he wanted to be at the opening meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in New York Oct. 23 and that if he first visited Moscow , the treaties would have to be finished in New York while the Assembly sat .

Mr. Byrnes suggested that by limiting all speeches to five minutes , the Italian economic commission , now behind schedule , could dispose of reparations issues within the time fixed . He had no criticism of the time taken by the conference , he said , declaring that it was good that the small nations had had an opportunity to talk as much and as long as they desired . He recalled that he had known the United States Senate to take a lot of time passing laws , even though there were no translations to delay the progress , as there were in Paris .
