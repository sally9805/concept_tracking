The 34-year-old International Ladies Garment Workers ' Union last week pulled off another " first " in the labor movement. * I.L.G.W.U. 's 35,000 cloak &; suit workers ( one-eighth of its total membership ) signed a new five-year contract in which the only major change was a provision for their employers to put $2,000,000 a year into an old-age insurance fund . Under the new agreement , each cloakmaker , at 65 , will receive $600 a year-a good deal more than most of them can expect from Federal old-age benefits . <P> <P> * Its most spectacular first came two years ago , when Manhattan dress manufacturers agreed to penalize themselves for inefficiency , as defined by the union ( TIME , Feb. 24 , 1941 ) . Another , a union revue , Pins and Needles ( 1937 ) , that became a Broadway hit .
