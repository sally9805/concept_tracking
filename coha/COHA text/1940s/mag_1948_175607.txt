In his lonely cabin near the Sikanni River in Northern British Columbia , Trapper John Pich , 38 , lay abed . Two days before he had eaten tainted food . Now his belly was bloated and he was in mortal agony . Primitive John Pich thought he would die if the poison was not taken from his stomach . <P> Trapper Pich took up his eight-inch hunting knife , plunged it into his belly . He groped for his stomach , could not find it . Because he knew he must die unless he got help , he staggered across the cabin to his rifle , went to the door , fired three shots-the S 0 S of the wild . <P> Pich 's nearest neighbor , Trapper George Farrel , miles away in the frozen forest , heard no shots . But Parrel 's huskies sensed something wrong and grew restless , soon were howling . Farrel broke camp , set out for Pich 's cabin . After struggling through a blizzard he got there in time to hear Pich gasp out his story before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's huskies . To save them from starving , Pich had shot them . <P> After trekking 75 miles west to the Alaska Highway at Trutch , B.C. , Farrel got the news through . Last week R.C.A.F. men flew north from Fort St. John to get Pich 's body . Farrel had told them where to look for it : in a snowy tree 's branches , safe from the wolves .
