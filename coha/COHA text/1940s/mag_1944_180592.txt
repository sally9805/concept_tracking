The fighting on Leyte was in many ways the most remarkable of the Pacific war . The Japs made only a halfhearted attempt to defend the beaches , then fled inland in disorganized haste . Before they could regroup for a real fight , they had lost half their total force - 14,405 killed and wounded , by General Douglas Mac-Arthur 's count . <P> Major General John R. Hodge , commanding the XXIV Corps ( 7th and 96th Divisions ) , called the fighting the fastest in the Pacific war , observed that " the Japs will run if they have a place to run to ... they are running in all di rections . " Jap pillboxes were flimsily constructed . When Lieut . General Shiro Ma-kino 's 16th Division men counterattacked , they came not in overpowering thousands , but in driblets of 50 to 200 men who were easily mowed down by machine-gun fire . <P> U.S. casualties were relatively light . In the first week 's fighting 518 had been killed . 139 were missing , 1,503 had been wounded . <P> Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least was the Filipinos themselves , whose guerrillas had been harassing Jap command posts , spying on sea movements , running weather stations and flashing messages to U.S. listening posts . Since the fall of 1942 , when a weak radio signal was received in Australia from Panay , Douglas MacArthur had been supplying the rebels by submarine . Last week the guerrilla chief on Leyte and Samar , lithe , impassive Colonel Ruperto Kangleon claimed that his men had killed 3,800 Japs in the past year . Kangleon 's chief of staff was a U.S PT-boat officer who missed the last Fortress out of Mindanao - one of many U.S. soldiers and sailors in the island who never surrendered . <P> Exploitation . General MacArthur and his Sixth Army commander , Lieut . General Walter Krueger , had chosen Leyte as their target because its capture would seal off Mindanao and the other southern and central Philippine Islands , furnish bases for U.S. planes to cut Japan 's supply lines to the East Indies storehouses . Then they had picked for the main assault the spot on Leyte where their armor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper half of the eastern shore line which leads down into the fertile Leyte Valley . <P> Last week Major General Franklin Sibert 's X Corps , which had made the northern ( right flank ) landing on the eastern shore , pushed inland after capturing the capital city of Tacloban , where Philippines President Sergio Osmea promptly set up his provisional capital . Then Sibert 's troops fanned out along the north coast , and southward to join Hodge 's XXIV Corps , which was moving north from Burauen after driving inland from their beachhead . <P> The Japs fought fanatically for the inland town of Pastrana , and U.S. casualties there were heavy . But the Japs , after losing the Leyte Valley and its excellent airfield terrain , streaked for the west coast , began embarking for Cebu in barges and other small craft , under fire from U.S. PT boats . Meanwhile the 21st Infantry , which had landed on A-day at Leyte 's southern end , overran the southern third of the island with help from guerrillas . This week Douglas MacArthur announced that two-thirds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been liberated .
