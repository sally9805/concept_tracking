txt ADVISES DOUGHTON President 's Letter Bars Levies That ' Make the Poor Poorer ' FOR EVASION-PROOF PLAN He Says 3 /2 Billion Rise Is Minimum Required  --  Goes to Virginia for Rest By FRANS L. KLUCIillOBN Special to TEE New YORE Tnizs . CHARLOTTESVILLE , Va. , May 2 ? President Roosevelt , making public his views tonight on how the $3,500,000,000 in additional taxes should be levied , declared that the added taxes should not " make the rich richer and the poor poorer . " The Executive 's views were given in a letter to Chairman Doughton of the House Ways and Means Committee , written under date of yesterday and made public here this evening shortly after the President 's arrival at the home near here of Major Gen. Edwin M. Watson , White House secretary . Stephen Early , another secretary , said that the President 's letter was equivalent to a message to Congress . Mr. Roosevelt stated that the tax bill , now under consideration by the House committee , should be based upon " the principle of ability to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide an " evasion proof " system , devised in such a manner " that every individual and every corporation will bear its fair share of the tax burden . " Except for laying down such general principles , the President 's letter was vague enough to permit various interpretations . Mr. Roosevelt was insistent , however , in declaring that it was imperative for the protection of democracy in the United States that the rich should not be permitted to profiteer and that no taxes should be put upon those in the low-income groups that would affect their living conditions . THE PRESIDENT 'S LETTER The text of the President 's letter to Chairman Doughton read as follows : Secretary Morgenthau has recommended that three and onehalf billion of additional taxes should be levied during the coming year to defray in part the extraordinary defense expenditures . This total represents the minimum if our revenue requirements . I hope that you and the other members of your committee will act favorably on this goal . You will recall that in my budget message this year I suggested a financial policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of national income . I. urged that additional tax measures should be based on the principle of ability to pay . This still is my view . I , am confident that your committee will recommend legislation specifically aimed at making the Federal revenue system evasionproof and so devised that every individual and every corporation will bear its share of the tax burden . The income tax can not fix // the tax liability of individuals and corporations with equity as long as the tax base is defined to exclude substantial and significant elements of income . I hope your committee , with the help of the Treasury , will formulate . a tax bill which will convince the country that a national defense program intended to protect our democracy is not going to make the rich richer and the poor poorer . I am sure that you and I are agreed that defense is a national task to which every American must contribute in accordance with his talents and treasure and that the people of the United States are gladly willing to make whatever sacrifices may be necessary to strengthen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocated by Secretary Morgenthau would put the heaviest tax burden to mbet a portion of special defense costs upon those in the middle-income bracket  --  those earning more than $2,000 and not more than $10,000 annually . It was learned on good authority that the Administration plans to insist that excise taxes shall not be permitted , or shall be removed from such household appurtenances as radios and refrigerators , articles used , or which it is desired shall be used , by Americans in all wage groups . In a press conference at the White House recently the President was asked whether he would have a statement to make on taxes , or whether he would send a message to Congress on the subject . He replied that he would have something to say to the public later . Mr. Early said this evening that the letter to Mr. Doughton represented the execution of this pledge . This was taken as an indication that Mr. Roosevelt would have nothing more to say upon the tax program . With Harry L. Hopkins in his party the President arrived at the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wooded valleys of Virginia . General Watson 's home lies between Jefferson 's Monticello and the home of President Monroe . Mr. Roosevelt expects to take his ease tomorrow and to motor Sunday to Staunton , Va. , about forty miles away , where he will make a speech in connection with the dedication of a national shrine to Woodrow Wilson . Those close to the President indicated today that the speech would not be of major importance . It was thought possible , however , that fastmoving international developments might cause Mr. Roosevelt to change his mind .
