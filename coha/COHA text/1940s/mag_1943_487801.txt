THIS diary is a rash attempt to write history before it has happened . After the collapse of Germany there will be many opportunities for my less friendly readers to write in to tell me that my fore , .. casts have been disproved . It will be easy to be wise after the event  --  as I put down these words I have no idea when or where the Allied attack will be made . But in recording these imaginary events from the moment of the collapse of Germany I have tried to avoid anything so sensational as to be improbable . The happenings are depressing ; so they will be , unless we in the great democracies prove worthy of our system of government . They constitute a cautionary tale . Tomorrow always comes . We are preparing for it , making it , by every one of our actions today . The United States prepared for Pearl Harbor by its rejection of the League of Nations . Great Britain prepared for Dunkirk by its excuses in Geneva for Japan 's attack on Manchuria in 1931 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about " freedom " and " democracy " prepared for fascism by their selfish and lazy interpretation of those words . I can not do better than quote a sentence by Philip Gribble : " Today is yesterday 's effect and tomorrow 's cause , and not merely yesterday 's future and tomorrow 's history . " June 30 . Gerald Barry , editor of the News Chronicle , rang me up at three this morning . Willy Forrest , cabling from G. H. Q. , has confirmed a midnight report from Berne that the German army in southern Austria has surrendered . The B. B. C. 7 a. m. news merely announced that the Allied forces had crossed the Loibl Pass and two other passes over the Karawanken Alps and had captured Klagenfurt . In other sectors there is tough German resistance . A day of wild rumors . The Cabinet met twice . It appears that the Allies are hesitating to announce the news , for they do n't yet know how much attention to pay to this army surrender and whether it has taken place in agreement with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stopped by a large crowd in Whitehall and he stood on the running-board , gave the V sign for victory , and promised that there would be good news within the next forty-eight hours . Stayed late at the office . Reports from all over the place about serious rioting in Vienna , with the police refusing to fire on the crowds . July I. The 7 a. m. news bulletin contained a special announcement urging everybody to listen to the 1 p. m. news , when the Prime Minister would broadcast . Secret session of the House of Commons , at which we were given the contents of this broadcast . Allied troops are advancing into Austria and are meeting with no resistance . One German corps commander and five divisional commanders have surrendered . No news has been received from German G. H. Q. , but Dr. Goebbels broadcast an impassioned appeal to workers and civil servants to carry on . There must not be another " stab in the back , " he urged , and added that the German armies were still fighting successfully except in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traitors , had surrendered . The P. M. 's broadcast insisted that the German surrender was to be expected within a few hours ; that when it came , it must be unconditional ; that the armies of the United Nations would march victoriously through Berlin ; that work must go on in our factories and offices with greater energy than ever ; that the time was drawing near when we should have the opportunity of showing our gratitude to the United States by hastening the defeat of its principal enemy , Japan ; and that we must not forget the humiliations we had suffered in Hongkong , Malaya , Burma , and Singapore . The appeal to go back to work was not very successful . All traffic had to be diverted this evening from the Piccadilly district . Rain helped to prevent much in the way of rowdyism , but I saw a good many men in Allied uniforms being carried across Leicester Square . July 2 . Apparently there 's some dispute as to whether we should march into Germany as soon as we can or whether we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal of the inevitable blood-letting , both inside Germany and in the occupied countries . Hundreds or thousands of Nazis and dozens or hundreds of Quislings October 30 , 1943 will be murdered by the people they have oppressed , and we do n't want to interfere except , perhaps , to take into custody the more notorious war criminals . Even in their case , if some of them were- to be shot by their own compatriots we should be relieved of a very difficult problem . But if troops are on the spot , they must almost inevitably maintain order . Therefore the British Cabinet is supposed to want days or even weeks to elapse before our men march into Berlin , and the generals are supposed to want to march there without delay . There is talk of a not very satisfactory compromise  --  small detachments will take over government offices and so on , but will remain as inconspicuous as possible , especially when there 's any shooting going on . This seems weak and undignified , but it 's thought to be the most sensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Revolts in France , Poland , and other occupied countries . According to Swiss reports , the German soldiers in many French towns did nothing to stop the rioting . In Paris there has been some shooting . In Brussels many Germans , still in uniform , tried to join up with a Flemish procession marching along the Rue de la Loi carrying anti-German banners . A " Free Belgian " broadcasting station , using the wave length of the regular Brussels station , suddenly began broadcasting tonight . It stated that all Germans had disappeared from the streets , and that the German military governor had appealed to the burgomaster for protection . That nasty little Rexist leader , Leon Degrelle , has been shot , but the wound is not serious . No hospital in Brussels wanted to take him in . A meeting of the United Nations governments established in London was called at St. James 's Palace to discuss the distribution of supplies in Europe . Eden in the chair . Each government naturally very anxious to have the distribution in its own hands , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All this , of course , has been argued out before , and the British and American delegates  --  especially the latter  --  were not at all enthusiastic . They argued that speed and efficiency were for the time being more important than politics . Am told the meeting was very noisy . The Soviet ambassador supported Anglo-American opposition to the smaller powers but left the impression that he did so because his government wished to help leaders of the resistance movements in the occupied countries rather than the governments in exile . July 4 . The situation inside Germany seems to be chaotic . In places , especially on the eastern front , the army is still fighting vigorously , but Allied troops have taken over Vienna and armored cars are reported to have advanced up the Danube as far as Linz . The civil administration is crumbling . Something very like the Soldiers ' and Workers ' Councils of the last few days of the last war have been established in Hamburg and various cities of the Ruhr . Our aircraft have been on very widespread491 sweeps over Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of leaflets telling the people to stop the war . July 5 . Fourteen solid hours of debate in the House of Commons , and , even so , many of us never had a chance to put forward our own particular solutions of the problems of peace . The Prime Minister , of course , had a terrific welcome , and nobody protested when people in the public gallery broke all the rules by clapping and cheering . He even looked up and with a broad grin on his face waved his bundle of papers at them . In the early part of his speech , when he was talking about the way the support of Parliament had given the government strength throughout the difficult years since that day in 1940 when it had been promised toil , blood , tears , and sweat , I thought he was going to break down . But he turned quickly to practical matters . He warned us that we must not expect an immediate relaxation of food or other restrictions , and that some rationed foods might even have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the occupied countries of Europe would be so urgent . Then he announced that some categories of married men with families -- especially those with long service  --  and key men for peace-time industries would at once be demobilized . There was so much discussion of this in the debate , so much rejoicing about it , that inevitably many Americans will conclude that we are n't sufficiently determined to play our full part in defeating Japan . July 6 . German divisions surrendering all over the place . Brigadier Geoffrey Neville , who has had to tell the press a good many depressing things at his daily conferences at the Ministry of Information during the last few years , let himself go this morning . Said that the prisoners now numbered well over a quarter of a million . The Russians are making great progress in their northern and central sectors . Still no word from the German Supreme Command or from Hitler . Not even an appeal to go on fighting . The Swedish legation has a dispatch that none of the 492 really important generals will make himself hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowds have been marching down the Wilhelmstrasse in Berlin yelling for peace . July 7 . Allied troops are in Munich and Frankfurt . Millions of leaflets have been dropped in Berlin warning the people that the Allies will be there within a few days , promising them that they will not be harmed if they obey our orders at once , but threatening death to anybody who is subsequently convicted of aiding any Nazi , of the rank of Gauleiter upward , to escape . Saw Bill Shaer in Fleet Street . He is just off to Munich for the Columbia Broadcasting System . July 8 . The Munich and Frankfurt jobs were done by air-borne divisions . A bunch of men were also landed at Salzburg , and advanced on Hitler 's home just outside Berchtesgaden . They met with no resistance of any kind , but they found the famous bronze doors of Hitler 's hideout closed and were compelled to blow them up . The whole villa was empty . In Hitler 's large study papers were scattered over the floor , and many had been burnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worker saying that the Anglo-American desire to get to Berlin as soon as possible is due above all to the desire to get there before the Russians . July 9 . Hitler is dead . He was apparently flying to Spain or South America , and something must have gone wrong with the aircraft . It tried to land at Cologne , but the airfield was being so heavily plastered by American bombers that the pilot turned back and made a forced landing in a large field near Bochum . Although Hitler had shaved off his moustache , he was recognized by some of the workers who came to the rescue . They grabbed him , shot the pilot who tried to defend him , and after a short debate dragged him off to their works and threw him into a great caldron of molten metal . Not very nice , but quite nice enough for a man who has brought unparalleled misery to the world . There 's a sense of relief that he has been dealt with by his own people . It saves the business of a trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martyr . Another Swedish report is that Goring has committed suicide in front of the memorial to his first wife at Karin-hall . Many thousands of war criminals are to be sent to Sachsenhausen and other concentration camps , but I hear tonight that the former inhabitants are not automatically to be set at liberty . They are to be held by the orders of AMG . Why ? Apparently they might not be " politically safe . " This is not by any means the only indication of reaction . The Daily Worker published this morning an angry and obviously inspired article claiming that the Soviet government has not been consulted about the conditions of the occupation of Germany . The Russians , who The NATION have their own bunch of " Free Germans , " even less representative than our own , are reported to be advancing at great speed westward into Poland . People in London are greatly worried lest there should be incidents between them and the provisional Polish government , which is getting ready to fly back to Warsaw . July 11 . Excellent broadcast from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporation . He described the taking over of official buildings . Crowds had been apathetic or , in some cases , welcoming . When the flags of the United Nations were hoisted over the building where Hitler , Mussolini , Chamberlain , and Daladier had signed the Munich agreement to dismember Czechoslovakia , one man shouted " Heil Hitler ! " and was lynched by the crowd before Allied soldiers could reach him . In the working-class districts some red flags appeared , and Shirer described how he saw some youths chalking up the letters K. P. D. ( German Communist Party ) on the walls of the royal palace . He mentioned the complications caused by the fact that we have no United Nations flag . There seems to be - no agreement as to which flag is to be hoisted first , how many of them are to be flown , and how room is to be found for the flags of all the United Nations . Besides , one flag would help to show the Germans how they have united the world against them . July 12 . Goebbels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pep talk " there a few hours before the air-borne division arrived , and was taken by surprise . The head porter at the hotel wanted to give him up to the Allies and suggested to other members of the staff that they should lock him in his rooms . One waiter told some officers with Goebbels , who shot the head porter out of hand . This so enraged other members of the hotel personnel that two of them followed Goebbels to a private house where he hoped to hide for a few days and others went to warn British officers . The house was surrounded , and Goebbels was captured without the firing of a single shot . July 14 . The Czechoslovak government is back in Prague . President Benes arrived by air and drove in an open car through the Vaclayske Namesti and across the Charles Bridge to the Hradschin Castle . Extraordinary scenes of enthusiasm . I believe the Norwegians , with King Haakon , are now somewhere in their own country , but the moment has not yet arrived for them to come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister of Information and gained the impression that they are on the point of leaving . He told me that there has been a lot of shooting in Antwerp , and that the Germans have set up machine-guns all the way down the Place de Meir . There wo n't be an all-inclusive Allied military occupation of Germany . It will be almost entirely an Anglo-American job , as the European Allies will need their national contingents in their own countries , at least during the first few weeks . At the most , there will be one or two " token " contingents . Disquieting dispatches from Washington in the morning 's papers . There was a very angry debate yesterday in the House of Representatives , organized by the same old group of diehards and isolationists . The Prime Minister 's speech in the House of Commons is being interpreted , very unfairly , as an indication that the British are going to slacken off in their efforts against Japan . Geoffrey Parsons has sent a long dispatch to the Herald Tribune explaining how natural it is that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been removed , but he fears the influence of the strong German groups in America . Ed Murrow of the C. B. S. says the British government 's decision to demobilize certain groups from the army has created the worst possible impression in America , although the Administration in Washington knew of the plan in advance and approved of it , especially in view of the fact that we are now expected to increase our production in order to help in sending urgent supplies to Europe . It is said that the Cabinet is very worried by the violence of this attack in Congress , which is attributed only in part to the old desire to use anti-British or any other prejudice as a stick with which to beat the President . July 15 . The Prime Minister was asked in the House of Commons about peace negotiations . He said that he - was in consultation with Washington and Moscow and that a preliminary conference would be held as soon as possible . He could not yet say when and where , which is fairly obvious since Germany still has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace would not be negotiated for a long time anyhow. ? presumably after the des feat of the Japanese . Heard another broadcast by Bill Shirer . There seems to be a kind of vacuum in Germany  --  nobody , in uniform or out of it , takes any responsibility . Some people had expected that the German General Staff would ask for terms without delay in order to avoid serious fighting on German soil . But it now looks as though the generals were n't going to do anything so definite . Like old soldiers in the song , they simply fade away . In some sectors there 's still stiff fighting in progress , but in others our motorized divisions advance as they please . If it goes on like this , the problem of establishing order again is going to be very difficult . Shirer pointed out that after the last war twenty-five Americans were able to organize the distribution of a million meals a day , but to do that the civil administration must still be working efficiently . It is n't , at any rate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second instalment of Mr. Bartlett 's diary will appear next week. 50 Years Ago in
