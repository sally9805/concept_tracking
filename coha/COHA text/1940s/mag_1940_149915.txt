Bustling Montreal , biggest Canadian city ( 818,000 ) and No. 3 French-speaking metropolis of the world , * has a Gallic taste in mayors , and last week she exercised it again . Her last mayor was flamboyant Camillien Houde , who distinguished himself in a number of ways . He got the city into so much financial hot water that a provincial commission had to be set up to manage the city 's affairs . He got more hearty laughs out of Queen Elizabeth than any other Canadian official when Their Majesties visited the Dominion in 1939 . And this year he issued a proclamation ( later suppressed by the censor ) advising his French-Canadian constituents not to register for the Canadian draft . <P> When that happened , the Dominion Government descended on clowning Camillien in dead of night and bundled him off to a detention camp ( detention for Canadians , internment for aliens ) . His fellow detainees promptly elected him chairman of the camp entertainment committee . Legally last week Houde was still Mayor of Montreal , and right up to election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mme. Houde while he earned in addition 20 daily for work in the camp . Even under this cloud , last week Camillien Houde saw his political henchman Leon Trepanier win 15,591 votes , just 974 votes short of victory in a listless election . <P> The winner by this tiny margin was another unusual figure , an insurance tycoon , J. Adhemar Raynault , who once before left his business to serve briefly as Mayor of Montreal , gave the city an administration active in Red-baiting . No spendthrift , M. Raynault slashed civic expenses . In his Gallic thrift Mayor Raynault had the mayor 's official $1,400 fur robe stuffed away in a city vault to save the annual 3% furrier 's storage charge . Moths ate all but the buttons . <P> Labor groaned at his election , called him a " tool of the power trust . " More important , Montreal suspected that Mayor Raynault was a political stalking horse for Maurice Le Noblet Duplessis , Quebec boss of the conservatives . Duplessis , no friend of Great Britain , lost his provincial premiership and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's war enthusiasm a year ago , but is struggling for a comeback . He represents a great body of French Canadians who are getting almost as wary of World War II as they were of World War I ( when there were ugly antidraft riots ) . If Mayor Raynault is a symptom of a resurgence of Duplessis sentiment , Canada may have to clap many more French Canadians into detention camps to keep French Canada in line . <P> *No. 1 : Paris . No. 2 : Marseille .
