On the way through Congress last week , but stalled temporarily behind Conscription , were bills upping to $3,259,000,000 the funds voted or requested so far this year for the U. S. Navy . This respectable sum was only a down payment . Before the Navy which the U. S. now has on order can be completed , equipped and manned , Congress will have to dig up at least $7,000,000,000 more . <P> At Sea the U. S. had what looked like the mightiest of navies ( 1,330,415 tons ; 397 warships of all kinds ) . Its effective Navy included : 15 battleships , six aircraft carriers , 37 cruisers , 237 destroyers , 102 submarines , 1,300-odd useful combat airplanes . Great Britain at last reports had a little less tonnage ( 1,253,744 ) and 336 warships , was far behind the U. S. in submarines ( 56 ) and destroyers ( 192 ) . * The world 's third sea power , Japan , has afloat 241 combat vessels ( tonnage : 961,326 ) . Japan , Italy , Germany-the combination which the U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service only 409,323 tons more than the U. S. <P> But these totals were deceptively simple ; U. S. arithmetic looked better than the total facts . Nobody knew how much or how fast secretive Japan was adding to its fleet-or when and whether the British Navy would fall to enemies of the U. S. As of last week , the U. S. 's " Big Navy " was just big enough to keep its defensive watch in the Pacific and a small squadron in the uncertain Atlantic . Its 15 battleships made up the most powerful battle line of any navy , but the average dreadnought age is 23 years . Three were so far outdated that Congress was asked to vote money to modernize their guns and armor . In the impressive total of destroyers were 109 World War I veterans , recently recommissioned . The U. S. was behind both Great Britain and Japan in the important categories of cruisers and carriers . <P> " Under Construction " in loose naval lingo means variously that new ships are : 1 ) in the prefabrication stage ( when parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) actually being built in shipyards ; 3 ) in fitting-out basins , where newly launched hulls are armored and equipped . By last month the U. S. Navy could say that it had thus under construction an additional , enormous fleet , to be completed in the following yearly quotas : <P> 1940-eight destroyers . <P> 1941-two battleships , twelve submarines , 17 destroyers . <P> 1942-one aircraft carrier , four cruisers , 13 submarines , 13 destroyers . <P> 1943-six battleships , ten cruisers , 14 submarines , 23 destroyers . <P> 1944- two battleships , seven cruisers , three aircraft carriers ( with one more carrier to follow in 1945 ) . <P> On Paper . Congress last month wrote down a second , still larger fleet-to-be , 70% ( 1,325,000 tons ) bigger than the Navy then existing and planned . Reason : Hitler . With this new program , the U. S. Navy was to have the hitherto incredible total of : 15,000 airplanes , 35 battleships ( including several 45,000-ton ones ) , 20 aircraft carriers , 88 cruisers , 378 destroyers , 180 submarines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
