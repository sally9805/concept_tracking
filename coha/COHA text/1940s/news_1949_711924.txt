txt Vice President Alben W. Barkley held tonight that the Senate 's , Southeniers were not entitled to an area of immunity from the closure . or " gag " rule that they have used to prevent action on President Truman 's civil rights program and hope to use again . His decision , which both sides considered to be a grave and momentous one in the Senate 's long history , was instantly appealed by the leader of the Southern group , Senator Richard B. Russell of Georgia . The great issue as to whether the Senate would sustain Mr. Barkley was put over until tomorrow . Specifically , Mr. Barkley held valid a petition , filed by a bipartisan group of thirty-three Senators , asking that the present closure rule be applied to silence the Southerners . Since Feb. 28 they have been employing the filibuster , or time-consuming debate intended to prevent a vote , against an amendment which would harden the very closure rule now at issue . Change in 80th Congress Ruling Mr. Barkley ruled that the " gage could be pressed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote , to halt the filibuster in spite of the fact that the Southerners have been attacking a " motion " to bring up a measure  --  the proposed amendment  --  and not that measure itself . As the Republican presiding officer in the Eightieth Congress , Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg of Michigan had ruled that the Southerners were impervious to any closure so long as it was a motion , and not a measure , against which they talked . The Barkley decision in its practical effect reversed Mr. Vandenberg , although the Vice President declared that the Vandenberg precedent was not at issue this time because the circumstances were different . Nevertheless , the filibuster was by no means broken when the Senate quit for the night at 8:06 o'clock . All day , both sides had been seeking recruits on the coming showdown , whether Vice President Barkley would be upheld or repudiated by the Senate itself on the roll-call for tomorrow . There seemed to be little doubt that the Southerners , who rely upon much Republican support on the Barkley test , had lost some ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coalition arrayed against them had plainly picked up strength . Whether the strength of the Southerners and allied forces had declined sufficiently to permit Mr. Barkley 's decision to stand was the major question . It had been conceded on every hand that as of this morning they had held a somewhat commanding position . Tonight they claimed a slight edge . Walter F. White , executive secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , an organization which is pressing for a stiffened closure against filibusters , told reporters in midafternoon that after interviews with many Senators his associates were confident that " several " had changed their minds and decided to support what was then only an expected Barkley ruling , Thus tonight great matters hung upon what the line-up of the nior- , row would be . For the proponents of the rules change the road ahead was yet long and difficult . Assuming that they were able to sustain Mr. Barkley , they would then have to get a two-thirds vote actually to impose closure . Once that goal was reached , each Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " gag " actually fell . When it did fall ' it would fall only on- the motion to . bring up the amendment , and not . on the amendment itself . For the amendment , another two-thirds vote would be required to end de . bate . Time and again the Southerners have declared their adamant determination to go on to the end against any alteration of the rule . They have defended it as the one greatest weapon for Senate minorities ; in this case it is their own Minority against the President 's civil rights proposals . Without a change in these rules there would be no way now , or later when motions come along to bring up various of the civil rights bills themselves , to silence the opposition except by previously exhausting it . Mr. Barkley 's decision , if it stands , would sharpen closure for the second time in a century and a half and permit the Senate to reach a vote upon the pending closure amendment . That amendment simply would spell out in the Senate 's law of procedure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . - The Vandenberg ruling last year , Mr. Barkley told the Senate while Senator Vandenberg himself sat forward in his chair , was not a valid precedent for the present situation . Then . the Vice President said , the effort was actually to displace a " pending measure " ? which dealt with civil aviation  --  with another , the poll tax repealer . In these circumstances , he went on , a petition to apply closure against Southern speakers objecting to bringing up the poll tax bill , indeed was inapplicable . But the position now , Mr. Barkley continued , was one in which there was no pending measure before the Senate and nothing to displace . He turned then to - the present closure rule , which was adopted in 1917 , as the Senate 's reaction to a filibuster against a bill to arm merchant ships against the Germans . That rule . the first abridgement of unlimited Senate debate since 1806 , was to the effect that two-thirds could apply closure to any " pending measure . " Later , holes were found in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold that a " motion " was not a " measure , " in the sense that the rule makers of 1917 had intended , Mr. Barkley asserted , was to take an unnecessary " narrow and legalistic " view . The Senate of 1917 , he asserted , clearly intended to act so that debate could be stopped on any sort of business . He added that he " could not believe that the Senate in 1917 did n't know what it wanted , did n't know where it was going and did n't know how to get there . " As Mr. Barkley went on , he dropped what seemed to some to be hints that he was prepared , when and if the time came , to knock out another parliamentary entrenchment previously used by the Southerners . Sometimes they have filibustered over the quality and content of the Senate Journal , ' a matter held in the past not to be in the area of a " measure , " in order to prevent a vote upon some bill . argument by Southern Leader Just before Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to how he should rule . 1Senator Russell asserted that " every one " of five precedents , ineluding that of Mr , Vandenberg , was against any attempt . to press closure down upon debate on a moI lion . Mr. Russell , looking up at Mr. lBarkley in the chair , read from the record of last year declarations by Mr. Vandenberg to the effect that while he wished he could do otherwise , he had " no alternative " to holding the Southerners immune . Senator Russell then read this passage from Mr. Vandenberg : . " The integrity of Congressional procedures transcends , at this critical hour in the world 's history , any possible transient advantage which might come from a ruling of a different character . " In retort , Senator Scott W. Lucas of Illinois , the majority leader , asserted that to hold that a " motion " could never be put under closure 's ban was to adopt a " legalistic " hairsplitting and was equivalent to saying that the Senate 's majority must be permanently hapless . He declared , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men could filibuster with impunity against a motion to bring up a bill , the effect was the same as a filibusteeon the bill itself . The end result , he said , was that no bill of any sort could ever be brought up , since all must come up for consideration by way of motions if a " determined minority " was sufficiently resolved otherwise . Republican Leaders Divided Mr. Lucas filed the closure petition at 6:18 P. M. On it were the names of seventeen Democrats and sixteen Republicans , the latter including Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio , the top Republican leader , but not Senator Kenneth S. Wherry of Nebraska , the Republican floor leader . All members of the Senate , Mr. Lucas asserted , believed " in full and free debate . " But , he ' added , " that privilege carries with it the responsibility for eventual action . That time for action has come . " Mr. Russell was on his feet , making a point of order at once against the closure petition just as a little later he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order . To hold that closure could under the present rules be clamped upon discussion at the motion stage , ' he argued , was to hold that the proposed rules , amendment had not been necessary . in the first place and was " vain and futile work . " Until after dusk , the whole of the Senate 's day was taken up by speeches from proponents of the new rule . One of these was Senator Claude Pepper of Florida , who left . his colleagues from the South more markedly than he had yet . done in Ibis Senate service . Mr , Pepper appeared not only for the rules Inhume but announced that-he proposed to vote for at least two of the Truman civil rights bills , the anti-poll talc - and anti-lynching bills . While the Southerners eyed him grimly , he asserted that many Southern Senators , including the late Oscar W. Underwood of Alabama and John Sharp Williams of Mississippi , had supported the original closure of 1917.                 @ @ @ @
