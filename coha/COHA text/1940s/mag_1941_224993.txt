The new trade accord with Mexico which the State Department has been negotiating for months was all ready to be signed and sealed . Then Standard Oil heaved a derrick in the works . One hinge on which the agreement turned was that U.S. oil companies accept a settlement for their Mexican properties , which were expropriated in 1938 . Standard Oil refused to settle ( see p. 83 ) . <P> Oil is a minor obstacle holding up the trade accord , which is designed to bring economic harmony between Mexico and the U.S. , pave the way for a mutual-defense pact . In Washington last week suave , tall Eduardo Suarez , Mexico 's Minister of Finance paid a series of polite calls , ending in the office of Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau . A few hours later , Mr. Morgenthau gave out the first official news of the impending agreement . <P> In return for Mexico 's cooperation , the U.S. is prepared to offer three inducements : 1 ) a currency deal to stabilize the peso ; 2 ) a loan to improve Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican silver . <P> <P> The currency deal will be handled by the Treasury from its $2,000,000,000 stabilization fund . The Treasury will buy pesos at a fixed price ( probably 4.85 to the dollar ) ; the Bank of Mexico will stand ready to buy them back , thus pegging the peso at its present level . About $30,000,000 is reportedly involved in this deal . From this money the Mexican Government would expect to make a token payment to U.S. oil companies . <P> Also from this fund may come a final settlement of U.S. claims for land expropriated by Mexico since 1868 . Of the $9,000,000 total of these claims , about $6,000,000 remains unpaid . Mexico plans to use the residue of the stabilization-fund advance for loans to industries ( steel , rayon , tin plate ) and for agricultural machinery . <P> Another $30,000,000 will go to Mexico in the form of a U.S. loan , through the Export-Import Bank . It will be earmarked by the Mexican Government for highway construction and for rehabilitation of the Mexican National Railway system . Still unfinished is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mexico 's 1,700-mile stretch of the Pan-American Highway . For this and other road-building projects , the hard-pressed Mexican Government plans to spend altogether $60,000,000 . For the railways , Mexico needs a total of $40,000,000 . The U.S. considers both these programs important for hemisphere defense . <P> U.S. purchases of Mexican silver , under the Silver Purchase Act of 1934 , jumped to $58,325,000 in 1935 . Last year they dropped to $25,811,000 . Silver is one of Mexico 's chief exports . By agreeing to a long-range program of silver purchases , the U.S. will help to redress Mexico 's unfavorable trade balance with the U.S. <P> This week , unless Standard Oil makes peace with Mexico , the State Department is expected to sign the trade agreement anyhow , let oil take care of itself .
