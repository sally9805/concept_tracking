ONE spring day Charles A. Martin was strolling through his apple orchard in the historic Natchitoches country of Louisiana when he noticed a sappy twig which had broken from an apple tree . This tree 's rather tasteless green fruit was no better than my other local apple . Nature , in the Deep South , has always been inhospitable to standard , or Yankee , varieties of Pyrus malus . Moved by impulse , Martin stuck the twig n a soggy hole . About a year later he noticed hat it had taken root , so he transplanted it . When the young tree came into bearing , Martin began picking , to his surprise , not the green , ill-flavored apples borne by its parent , out early fruit of excellent flavor and color , Suitable for cooking and eating . Nature , in a generous moment , had supplied the very apple he and his neighbors had wanted for years . Plant Patent Act Spurs Enterprise Unlike many people in the United States , Martin knew about the Plant Patent Act , so : e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law the right to be the sole proprietor of the new tree , and all cuttings from it , for 17 years . The law permitted him to license growers to propagate and sell cuttings , or grafted trees , and on every sale he could collect a royalty . So Martin added his apple to a new and distinct class of " invention " which has taken its place among the millions of patents on file in the United States Patent Office . Some of the inventions in this category are unique ; some are extremely valuable , bringing as much as $10,000 for patent rights to a single plant . Such inventions are changing the aspects of our gardens . Others seem destined to alter some of our eating habits , and may extend fruit-growing areas by making trees more resistant to cold and disease . Under patent law there always has been a " process " type of patent for use of fruit growers and farmers . As early as 1864 an Ohio man obtained a patent for his " process for retarding the bloom of fruit trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something new and different . It enabled Martin to obtain a 17-year patent on the apple tree itself . To obtain the patent , he had only to convince the patent examiner that his apple was a " new and distinct variety " and that it had been introduced to the public less than a year before his filing of the application . The patent Martin received 13 months later included a four-color reproduction of a color photograph which his attorney had had made from a specimen apple ( Plate VI ) . Whether he was to make money on his patent , Martin realized , depended on how well he stood with the gods of business and good fortune . A new fruit variety must be tested , and often may require 20 years to determine its adaptability to various areas , its resistance to disease and insect attack , and its ability to produce good fruit regularly . A Challenge to Growers and Amateurs The truly unique law of 1930 provided a strong incentive to growers to be alert for Nature 's " budsports , " or chance seedlings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new variety , duly propagated , may be the basis for a valuable patent . The widely known Delicious apple was a chance seedling . From a peach pit planted some 75 years ago originated the Elberta peach . The grapefruit is believed to be a natural mutation of the coarse-fruited shaddock . Amateurs with sharp eyes have the opportunity to spot in their own gardens a sport worth patenting . Or they may find it growing wild in a field or in the woods . Thus a picker in a Washington State apple orchard found a fine apple with four clearly marked segments , each different in color and flavor . But the grower never was able to locate the branch on which it grew . Perhaps he lost a fortune , because a " built-in " trademark like that would be observed and remembered by everyone . At the Patent Office I learned that patentable characteristics may include : unusual habits of growth ; relative immunity from disease and resistance to cold , drought , heat , wind , or soil conditions ; color of flower , leaf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fruits ; storage ability of fruit ; perfume , form , and other flower qualities ; and ease of asexual reproduction . I found a good explanation of the last-named term in the " case of the foreign heliotrope . " Growing a Blackish Heliotrope In Guatemala , Quincy A. Shaw McKean found a heliotrope unlike any he had ever seen . He brought back to the United States several hundred seeds and planted them . Three grew . Each seedling differed from its mates and from the mother plant . He  | p never was able to induce seeds from these three seedlings to grow , but he did " asexually " ( or vegetatively ) reproduce the plants by slips or cuttings that quickly took root . Selecting the best progeny , he destroyed all the others and applied for a patent , claiming the darkest-colored heliotrope known , a blackish violet outdoors . Other qualities included unique foliage , the large leaves having a peculiar suffusion of a violet-green shade . McKean could not have patented one of his seeds . No patent is issued on seeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , or on any plants that grow only from seeds ; or on tuber-propagated plants ( potatoes or Jerusalem artichokes ) . A new variety propagated by layering ( grounding and rooting a growing vine or runner , often done with berry bushes and strawberries ) , also is patentable . Nor could he have patented merely an imported plant . Prior to his application he had to reproduce it asexually , thereby establishing its adherence to its mother type . Plantsmen agree that this kind of plant creation is simple , even for the amateur , and that it often may be exciting . It is all too rare in our gardens . Of the more than 750 plant patents thus far granted , about half have been on roses . Nearly 75 percent of some 175 patents on edible plants and products are on fruits that belong to the rose family ? the Rosaceaewhich includes apples , peaches , nectarines , plums , apricots , pears , cherries , and berries . Farmer Yerkes 's " Gift from Heaven " Many of today 's improved fruits ? betterflavored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hardier , or more resistant trees or bushes ? originated as chance seed- lings , or sports , Nature 's sudden , mysterious deviations from type . " It could happen to anyone , " said William F. Yerkes , a farmer who lives today near Rio Oso , in Sutter County , California . One day he found a peach seedling , origin unknown . It had sprung up near his kitchen door , a good place for a shade tree , at least . So he pruned and cared for it , and in its fourth summer it bore large yellow freestone peaches that reminded him of the Crawford , but were even better . " I found it was an extra-fine peach , superior to anything I had known , " he recalled . " So I decided to propagate it for a small trial orchard . There the vigorous young trees , with short stocky limbs , came so loaded with fruit that I had to thin them heavily . They never suffered from frost , while neighbors lost on other varieties . " His first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plant Patent Act was signed by President Hoover . In 1932 he made out his patent application , in which he recorded that the high-quality , well-colored fruit had a slightly spicy flavor , even when it was picked hard for shipping . Also , it matured at a time when no other good yellow freestone was on the market . He received his patent a year later . What to do with what he called his " gift from Heaven " ? He decided to let an agent market the trees . With no fanfare , his trees have gone all over the land , to the extent of several hundred thousand . His small royalty per tree enabled him to pay for a modest farm . Now , almost 87 , Mr. Yerkes still runs the farm his peach seedling bought him . Dr. David Fairchild 's long and varied activities in plant exploration and introduction included , 20 years ago , an experiment that has its lessons for anyone interested in patenting a plant ( page 374 ) . Although it was before the days of such patents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | inventors and inventions may well have promoted the idea of a law to protect them . Dr. Fairchild had imported two varieties of Actinidia and had identified their family relationship . The Japanese Actinidia arguta , a hardy and vigorous vine , had borne in California a soft , sweetish fruit of low quality and small size . The Chinese yang tau , or Actinidia chinensis , of which seeds had been sent to him by Dr. Ernest H. Wilson , * had produced in California a few large fruits with the tart flavor and size of a giant gooseberry . The two varieties were growing at Wild Acres , Maryland home of Dr. Gilbert Grosve nor , President of the National Geographic Society , of which Dr. Fairchild has long been a Trustee . When the both burst into bloom one spring day , Dr. Fairchild conceived the idea of crossbreedin : : them . A successful hybrid might provide an abundant and use ful new fruit , excellent for jelly and sauces. growing on a vigorous arbor vine . Crossbreeding w a successfully accom plished , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He inspected and tasted the large , firm . tart product . Then he removed some seeds and sent them to friends for planting . This was to be the real test of the hybrid : Would it produce plants true to the hybrid traits of the first-generation fruit that tasted so good ? A number of seedlings did grow , some in foreign lands . But the dream of a fruitful Actlnldla hybrid was unfulfilled . Every one of the seedlings refused to bloom or to reproduce . a failing that hybrids exhibit only too often . So a successful Actinidia hybrid remains for someone else to achieve . However , Dr. Fairchild 's conception , and his detailed record of every step in the process , may well serve as a model for the amateur who " dreams up " a new variety of flower , fruit , or ornamental plant . Opportunities for Amateurs For the amateur the field is wide and open . There are about 280,000 species of plants . including fungi , now known in the world , of which perhaps a tenth are used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty but rankly odoriferous . David Burpee , no amateur , developed an dorless marigold by sniffing thousands of blossoms and selecting plants with little or no odor . A breeder of Nashport , Ohio , Anna L. Miller , found a gladiolus , usually odorless , having the one element that its beauty required . She patented her fragrant gladiolus . Large flower growers seek novelties adapted to large-scale marketing , and when an amateur develops a very good variety of flower a big firm may buy it outright for a substantial sum . If future sales appear uncertain , the firm may prefer to pay the cost of a patent and give the patentee royalties , which often range from 5 to 20 cents a plant . Today many growers and nurserymen pay for fruits that lengthen the marketing or canning season , or serve better for freezing or dehydrating . As a result of the arrival of spring and a study of the plant patent books of art , I have a dozen promising seedlings coming along in my peach nursery , a plot a few feet square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residue of a year 's canning . I have also been told that my vigorous young black walnut tree , a chance seedling I brought home and stuck in a hole , will eventually grow me some good Persian walnuts ( some call them " English " ) when I graft on the right stock . And I have a patented Blaze climbing rose coming along . My rejuvenated apple tree last year had a nice crop . I 'm looking it over carefully for anything resembling a sport . It was the story of Lenton Newman that made me realize how generous a lady Mother Nature can be . Nature Grows a Thornless Rose This actually is the story of a tea rose , that ancient and universally loved Chinese immigrant that exudes the delicate fragrance of fresh , slightly crushed tea leaves . One winter Lenton ( " Spud " ) Newman , an east-Texas lad of 14 , undertook with his father to grow roses on shares for a neighbor with a small business . The neighbor supplied them with several hundred rootstocks of hardy Rosa multifdora japonica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inexperienced  | Newmans by grafting on to each thrifty root a cutting from the fine and widely known E. G. Hill rose . By this method the world 's best roses are propagated , many of them on this same variety of rootstock . One day the Newmans were harvesting their modest crop of roses . A bloom without a single thorn was noticed ! They transplanted it to their garden . Two years later they had taken off 26 cuttings and grown them into plants about a foot high . The original was by now some 30 inches tall . It and every one o. its progeny were asmooth as lead pencil- . Spud told his high . school principal , who wrote to his Congressman and learned that it was possible to protect the find with patent . In September 1940 , the principal introduced the lanky young Texan to A. F. Watkins , one of the leading southern rose growers . Watkins was skepti cal . But he drove home with Spud and soon was feeling the long smooth stems with their magnificent bright-red blooms . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $250 . Sudden Freeze Kills Tender Plants Nurserymen re moved the top and limbs of the little plants , the roots not being dormant for harvesting . As Watkins viewed the small bundle of sticks , which could have been squeezed into a handful less than three inches in diameter , he regretted his deal . A month later his experts had obtained enough buds to graft about 700 rootstocks in the field . Then , in another month , the balmy Texas climate slipped a couple of cogs . The temperature dropped to below freezing : The tender new tops of the young plants , which had been forced into vigorous new growth , turned black from the ground up . Though dug up and replanted , not one grew . Fortunately for Watkins , he had previously budded some of the new buds on rootstock safely inside his Dixie Rose Nursery . These grew , and in December , 1941 , Watkins applied for a patent . He received it in September , 1942.  | The previous fall he had displayed thornless blooms at the Tyler Texas ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose the Festival . " His first lot of 70 , - 000 thornless wonders ? all had come true to type ? he sold to a wholesaler , who passed them on to a mail-order house . Then 200.000 more were ordered . On December 7 , 1944 . Watkins sold out to the Krider Nurseries , Inc. , of Middlebury . Indiana . For his patent rights and all his stock he received S10.000 . No higher price has been paid to date for any patented plant . The Krider people also paid him $1,000 for a single sturdy plant ? a climbing rose that likewise had lost its spikes . Protected by the Plant Patent law , the Kriders ' two thornless wonders can be sold for no more than any good rose , which is much less than fancy new roses brought in prepatent days . The only way a grower could make a profit on a new rose before 1930 was to build up , as secretly as possible , all the stock his capital permitted , then throw it all on the market at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . competitors would be building up their own stocks , grown from the nolonger-secret variety , now widely distributed . Today buyers no longer have to pay $5 or $10 for a new rose , $10 for a new iris or gladiolus bulb , $20 for a fancy dahlia . Each patented plant sold must carry a tag giving its patent number , which serves as a guarantee of its origin and assures fidelity to type . Milton 's Eden of Paradise Lost , with its " flowers of all hue , and without thorn the rose , " might well have included some painless berry bushes ( Plate VIII ) . Not till Luther Burbank 's day did anyone set out to breed away the thorns , and it took the master breeder 30 years to grow a good-flavored blackberry on a thornless vine . Only four and a half months after the Plant Patent law was passed , an application was made on a sport that had been found in a 10-acre patch of Young dewberries , or  | youngberries . This was a vine that was entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barberry ; then a thornless Logan blackberry , or loganberry , found in a California garden ; and a thornless hybrid , found in a thicket , that grew prolific crops of a new kind of berry . But before a thornless variety can displace ordinary varieties , nurserymen say , it must be combined with prolific bearing , good flavor , and other qualities . Also , new strains must be adapted to growing in various areas . Superior thornless berries are still sought . Golden Grow Some " Red " Apples Chance selection has been improving the apple for thousands of years . While Johnny Appleseed was spreading his cider-mill seeds all over Ohio , Indiana , and Illinois , young James Stark was riding west ( in 1816 ) to Pike County , Missouri . His nursery , expanded by his sons and grandsons , soon began seeking and breeding hardier and more productive fruit trees . In 1894 the Starks discovered the famous Delicious apple , a product of a farmer 's sport tree , and sold this variety by the million . A Delicious apple tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finder $6,000 . A Golden Delicious , located on a West Virginia mountaineer 's hill , was worth $5,000- to Paul Stark , fifth-generation seeker of new varieties . Years later , after the Plant Patent law came into being ( for which Mr. Stark is given much credit ) , the search for early reddeners brought the Starks a surprise ? a red-skinned hybrid of Stark Golden Delicious . Frank A. Schell , Cashmere , Washington , hybridizer , who originated this new apple , received $7,500 for his patent rights , highest sum paid for any fruit up to that time . Limbs or chance seedlings of apple trees accounted for 20 out of the first 26 apple patents . Improved types have been planted in Illinois , California , Virginia , Michigan , and Tennessee . One Delaware patent protects a cooking-eating apple that ripens two weeks earlier than Yellow Transparent , earliest on most markets . By a combination of natural sports and careful breeding the fruit industry continues to let out its belt , extending the growing areas far into Canada , into parts of Alaska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. Rumph planted a Chinese seed in his Georgia orchard and raised the first Elberta. this variety and others , like the yellow Crawford , have shown ambition t , , improve by means of natural sports . More patents have been issued on peaches than on any other plant except the rose , and three out of every four are sports or chance seedlings . Middle West growers have been seeking cold-resistant peaches for more than 40 years . Some varieties recently patented have withstood 20 degrees below zero , then have bloomed and borne fruit . In Queenston , Ontario , a small limb produced ripe peaches when all the rest were still green , beating Elbertas by six weeks . In British Columbia an early variety of Rochester was found and patented . After 40 years of research , California in 1947 had varieties which enabled it to grow 40 percent of our commercial peach crop . One variety ( Plate IV ) , the patent on which was assigned to the Armstrong Nurseries , Ontario , California , has borne 50 to 100 peaches only 15 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top-priced fruit ready for market before the first of June . $10,000 for a Peach Not long ago , J. Frank Smith , Arkansas orchardist , found a freak limb on his July Elberta ( a Burbank creation patented after the master breeder 's death ) . Smith 's limb ripened three weeks early , and the Starks recently contracted to pay him $10,000 for his patent rights . To date , that is tops for a patented fruit tree . A Virginia researcher , Dr. F. W. Holman . after years of crossing and recrossing , bred a peach with winter hardiness and other qualities , including " plumlike , waxy , and smooth or non-fuzz skin . " It may be classified as a true nectarine ? a peach with a smooth skin . We have had the fuzzless peach for many years , but its delicacy makes shipment difficult , and the tree is highly susceptible to diseases . Of the eight nectarine patents , four are on sports . One is for a tree that grew from some peach pits thrown out of a garden . Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The patent was assigned to the Agricultural Experiment Station at New Brunswick . New Jersey , where a second generation of this tree grew much larger fruit than its parent . Plums and the Patent Law Harry C. Robb , Washington , D. C. , attorney credited with conception and final achievement of the Plant Patent law , told me the idea  | came to him some years before 1930 , when he was denied even trade-mark protection on a plum evolved from years of hybridizing . He concluded that a special patent law was the only solution for the plant inventor 's problems . Burbank died four years before the patent law was passed , but his fame as a pioneer hybridizer doubtless helped to obtain passage of the law . Perhaps nothing would have pleased the plant magician more than to know that five patents were issued in 1932 on some of his finest plums , fruit of more than 40 years of breeding that had seen creation of some 60 new varieties of plums . Paul Stark , whose family firm is carrying on Burbank 's research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been greater had there been a patent law to protect its investment in developing new varieties . Royalties paid Mrs. Burbank , he added , total nearly 550,000 and will continue for years . Burbank and other hybridizers made the plum a valuable fruit for California and later for Oregon and Washington . But in most States it is still a delicate tree and offers a luscious target for plant inventors . Apricot Is a Delicate Immigrant The apricot is not yet perfectly at home in this country , though it has been known for more than 4,000 years . Today it challenges our inventors by coming into bloom just as spring frosts are due . Seeking a hardier apricot , Burbank crossed it with the plum ; his " plumcot " was one of the early indications that crosses between different genera could be made . Some 25 years ago began the importation of hardy types from northern Asia , Japan , and Europe in a systematic program to foster real hardihood . A Minnesota man has patented a variety which , grafted on a hardy hybrid plum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good keeping quality . California grows up to 90 percent of the Nation 's supply ; Washington most of the remainder . By far the greater part is canned . Improved varieties would greatly increase the consumption of this fruit , which is truly delicious when tree-ripened . Mouth-watering but unacclimated , the Bartlett pear is a prey of fire blight and other enemies ; so today most of this luscious fruit is grown on the Pacific coast , where cooler and dryer summers keep down the blight . Hybrids with a Chinese pear as one parent are more resistant but not of top eating quality . Not long ago Nature lent a hand by hybridizing a highly resistant Anjou on an Illinois farm . Another of the four pear patents was on a hardy seedling of unknown parentage at St. Louis Park , Minnesota . In California a sport limb produced pears of dark reddish-brown color instead of the green hardy color . Buds were grafted on quince seedlings , then limbs from these were grafted back onto hardy pear trees . These produced a new and more marketable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harbor , Ohio , produced a round pear with pink flesh . Wanted : Hardier Cherry Trees When Henderson Luelling , or Lewelling ( later to be joined by his brother Seth ) , trekked from Iowa to Oregon in 1847 , he carried along some cherries , from which grew the industry that today supplies most of our " sweet " varieties , such as Bing and Royal Ann ( Napoleon ) . The three Pacific Coast States supplied 82 percent of our 1947 crop , and seven western States supply the greater part of all that are grown for market . Even today the big sweet cherry that floods into far-western markets is a luxury in eastern cities . Growers still seek early , hardy , productive , and well-flavored varieties , both sweet and sour . But our trees , progeny of those from mild parts of the world , often are caught by spring frosts . The hot dry summer in parts of the South is bad for them , and the humid areas induce brown rot . Michigan , great sour cherry State , has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early ripeners , one a late ripener . The late bloomer may escape spring frosts . A hybrid sweet cherry developed in York , Pennsylvania ( Plate V ) , is a prolific bearer of fruit that is hard even when fully ripe . In all , eight patents , not counting an ornamental cherry with pendulous foliage , point to further extension of the cherry areas . The Strawberry : Native American The wild meadow strawberry of North America migrated to Europe about 1700 and there was wedded with the luscious Chilean beach berry . Our repatriated berry thrives from Florida to parts of Canada and Alaska . Literally tens of thousands of pure and hybrid strains are grown today . Experiment stations will test any new types that show promise . Ten patents have been issued , to residents of States as far apart as Michigan , Maryland , Oregon , Massachusetts , Washington , Virginia , and Tennessee . Senator George D. Aiken. of Vermont , patented an everbearing berry that grew good crops both summer and fall .  | All the citrus patents to date originated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seedless colored grapefruit , now grown widely in Texas and central Florida . This variety originated as a sport limb on a tree of Thompson pink , in Texas . Its colored rind is a natural " trade-mark . " Red- or pink-fleshed citrus fruits are most common in the " desert " areas . A seedless lemon was patented by a Californian in 1939 . Another grower found a fruit combining the flavor of lemon and orange . In Florida a seedless pineapple orange was patented in 1941 , and a seedless navel orange of unknown parentage but high quality was found in a small isolated grove . In 193C a very early maturing orange grew on a sport limb in the top of a Parson Brown orange near Dundee , Florida : it matured five to eight weeks early and was patented in 1945 . The Citrus Gold Rush Today 's citrus production has leaped to almost a third more than the 1935-44 average . In 1947 Florida . California , Texas , and Arizona produced 15 boxes of citrus fruits for ever man , woman . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the golden flood will rise steadily as more-productive varieties are planted . Nine patented avocados , mostly based on chance seedlings , are available to improve our salads . Some have oil content and nutty flavor . Oddly . this " alligator pear . though of high food value , can not be cooked or canned . The avocado was one of the first fruits of the world-wide explorations begun by Dr. Fairchild and Barbour Lathrop in 1899 . More and Better Fruits and Nuts Early-ripening grapes , others with high sugar content , still others that are seedless though they grew on a seed-bearing parent . give promise of increasing our huge crop of grapes . In 1947 , 37 States grew grapes for market , and an improved variety might have wide appeal . Of last year 's crop more than 43 pounds were marketed in some form for every person in this country .  | Two patents have been granted on the fragrant and gorgeously colored mango , which is increasingly important as a crop . Dr. Fairchild grew scores of varieties , some of them chance seedlings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 in diameter ; the other produces a smaller but good-keeping and shipping fruit . A Californian has patented a cherimova . This tropical American fruit has been difficult to keep and ship , but the new variety is suitable for picking while immature , as it later ripens to its full flavor , a combination of pineapple and banana . Some of its fruits , weighing nearly a pound , have over 26 percent sugar content . Sugar cane yielding up to 17 percent of the cane weight , and resistant to mosaic and leaf diseases , has been patented by Dr. Benjamin A. Bourne . With improved strains the Florida and Louisiana industry was saved from extinction and today averages more than 400,000 short tons of raw sugar per year . Carpathian Walnut Thrives in U. S. Usually , when we plant a walnut from one of our long-hybridized trees , it fails to produce a satisfactory tree . But when a walnut was brought from the Carpathian Mountain area of Romania 's Bucovina ( where a temperature of 50 ? below zero has been recorded ) and planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crops of as much as 270 pounds of large , full-meated nuts . The pecan , best of our native nuts , thrives naturally from Iowa to the Gulf . One patent was issued to a pecan specialist who spotted an unusual tree in a wild grove owned by an oil company . Permitted to take some buds , he grew a heavy-bearing variety . His tree blooms late , but its fruit matures early . Nuts like these would add valuable crops to many a farm and garden . Few plant discoverers have had more thrills than did a Tulsa , Oklahoma , man when he found the pendulous juniper . He had tried without success to breed a Rocky Mountain silver cedar with drooping branches . One day he saw a woodsman about to cut down a seedling that was " weeping " exactly as he desired . A limb was all he needed to propagate the graceful juniper he later patented . Other finds and hybrids include an improved tobacco plant for Connecticut , a hybrid hop in Oregon , a hardy mock orange in Minneapolis . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six inches across . A Minneapolis man patented a grass which made a very tough , dense , and resilient turf . Traced to a probable sport on a strain of bent , it has proved to be a vigorous grower . Some 30 years ago a chemistry professor , Dr. Ralph H. McKee , who was also chemist for the American Paper and Pulp Association , believed that some of our vacant lands should be growing lumber and pulpwood . But he found that the fastest grower of commercial pulp ? the aspen , or quaking-leaf poplar ? grew too slowly for a profitable crop . Later , learning of the work of Dr. Augustin Henry , of Kew Gardens , England , he initiated and directed scientific research which evolved hybrid poplars , the best of which grew amazingly fast . He reports that nearly half a million of his patented poplars now are growing more wood per year and per acre than any of Nature 's varieties will produce outside of the South . With them owners of cutover land ( one such owner has acquired half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns about as soon as does an apple orchard . An Eden of patented flowers would be a riot of colorful and strange variegations , some bred by Nature , others by man . A blue African violet , when bred with a pink sport , produced a new pure-white variety . The same strange result came from crossing a pink geranium with a white-cream type . A bright Castilian red carnation originated as a sport on a pink variety . But most of the 35 carnation patents are the result of careful breeding . At the ornamental plant greenhouses of the Bureau of Plant Industry at Beltsville , Maryland , I saw hundreds of carnations of all colors being bred to obtain pure strains and to develop disease " tolerance " and other commercial qualities . Some grow to a diameter of five inches . The outdoor dianthus , a sister species , has been used in these hothouse hybridizations . Giant Dahlias , 4-inch Pansies Gigantic blooms , such as those of the freesia patented in 1946 , have been the goal of some flower breeders . One dahlia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which grow on stems seven feet tall . Harold L. Ickes 's patented dahlia grows blooms up to nine inches across . Two greenhouse men in Westport , Connecticut , after years of breeding , obtained amazing pansy plants that grow three to five feet high . Each has from 10 to 15 stalks , bearing flowers four inches or more in diameter on stems 12 to 15 inches long . These are used as cut flowers in season . They have been seen at the White House and at social functions in New York . A million  | blooms of this patented hybrid are sold each season . No seeds or plants are marketed . Other unique flower patents include the widely sold pink delphinium and long-keeping gardenias . There are summer-blooming chrys anthemums , and varieties hardy enough for any winter . The color of a new chrysanthemum ( Plate VII ) is claimed by the patentee to be " more brilliant and closer to scarlet than that of any other variety known to me . " A dwarf azaleamum grows only six to eight inches high . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duce perfect blooms scarcely the size of a dime . One has a slight tea fragrance . A tiny peach tree that grows in a pot reaches only 30 inches when mature and grows real peaches . It first grew as a seedling in France . To achieve longlasting qualities in potted azaleas , the rhododendron , a closely related plant , has been bred with them . Numerous and or geous are the new pat ented varieties of ca mellias , rhododendrons . hibiscus , water lilies . snapdragons , buddleias. poppies , geraniums . and poinsettias . There is a real need for flowers and ornamentals that thrive in the shade . Roses Are Red ? Why Never Blue ? Roses now come in every color and tint of the rainbow ? save one . For her own private reasons , Nature h a s declined to give us a blue rose . The unde sired bluish cast of a fading red rose is bred out by use of a slight yellow strain . Nor has a " black " rose been found or bred , although long sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Germany and assigned to the Conard-Pyle Company , patentees of nu merous roses . In some lights Nigrette ap pears black . Many of the 350 commercial varieties of the rose in use today are not patented . The Better Times rose ( Plate II ) , most propagated of all , gave rise to various sports later patented . Plate III is a highly varie gated sport . Better Times was a sport on a rose imported many years ago by E. Gurney Hill , founder of  | the three extensive Hill concerns of New Richmond , Indiana . Hill , around 1900 , found that hothouse roses ? even the famed American Beauty created by George Bancroft , noted historian - diplomat ? were becoming low in vigor and often were cut down by mildew . He began infusing the outdoor vigor of the wild rose into our indoor weaklings . Finding a strong cerise-petaled sport , Hill hopefully named it Better Times , patented it in 1932 , and then gambled everything on propagating 400,000 plants . With these and their innumerable progeny the country 's florists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry A. Dreer , Inc. , of Philadelphia , imported and patented Crimson Glory . Its blooms , with deep velvety crimson petals and carmine edges , are seen everywhere , and as a " dominating " male parent it is a favorite with breeders who de-ire rich coloring or red tints . Crimson Glory was one parent of a rose which became the most valuable plant patent of the Armstrong Nurseries . In 1935 they made a lucky cross of Crimson Glory with a yellow Sister Therese and obtained a beautiful seedling with cerise bloom . As the Charlotte Armstrong , this variety won most of the national awards , and in 1941 scored the highest rating of All-America Rose Selections . This was after the usual two-year test in 18 test gardens of this country . The fudges of this pre-introduction test are the most expert of rose fanciers . Anyone may submit a new variety for test under varied conditions . The fragrant red Mirandy , which gained a similar award in 1945 , is an offspring of Charlotte Armstrong . Both are steady " best sellers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a million dollars for the firm . In 1936 Francis Meilland , scion of generations of French rose breeders , began work on a hybrid seedling that by 1940 struck the Duke of Windsor as " the loveliest rose in the world . " Robert Pyle , who since 1907 has searched Europe for fine roses , brought this " Mme. A. Meilland " here in 1943 and patented it . Now known as the Peace , its unique " very double " bloom is a blend of delicate tints of yellow , pale gold , cream , and ivory , with a ruffled edge  | of pink . Fully opened , it has a diameter of five inches or more ( page 362 ) . Another Conard-Pyle importation ( Plate I ) is an oddly bicolored rose from Spain . The basic color is pale yellow , on which splotches of carmine may cover half a petal or even the entire petal . Rarely are two of these odd blooms alike , and the unique colors change as the blooms age . Eugene S. Boerner , director of research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perkins Company , told me that patent control has given his company the chance to test its new creations , often for three years or more . His latest , the scarlet-red New Yorker , has survived the tests of 80 " test station " growers from Florida to North Dakota . Rose growing today is big business , for nearly 50 million are grown annually for florists and for garden use . Since the wars end , production ha been tremendous . California sold $10,000,000 worth in 1947 , while Oregon , Texas , Pennsylvania , and New Jersey together grew rose worth about twice as much more . X-rays and Chemicals Cause Plant Mutations Scientists foresee the 1 day when increase the human race may depend upon man ability to develop food plants with maximum productivity and resistance to natural enemies . Equally necessary may be improved trees to produce our lumber , pulpwood , oils . and food products more rapidly . Some hybridists and geneticists hope to cause new and bene ficial changes in plants by solving present mysteries of the geneand chromosomes and their inheritance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of " tools " for doubling or tripling the chromosomes , often producing mutations by heat and cold treatments , exposure to radiations such as X-rays , and application of chemicals like the powerful but poisonous colchicine . Exposure of a regal-lily bulb to X-rays resulted in a mutation , a flower with peculiar anthers and other changes which persist in the bulbs that grow from the parent 's bulblets . No colchicine-treated plants have yet been patented , but experiments indicate that the doubling or tripling of chromosomes resulting from use of this drug , or from similar means . may lead to useful and desirable changes in plants . Such methods hasten Nature 's processes and perhaps will lead toward plants far different from those of today .  |
