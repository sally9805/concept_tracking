To the long yellow oak table that is Edward G. Budd 's desk last week came a $9,000,000 order from Fruehauf Trailer Co. of Detroit . This order for 10,000 stainless steel unassembled semitrailer bodies meant that at 69 courtly Edward Budd was crossing a new frontier in the Detroit automotive field , where for years he has sold bodies and wheels to Chrysler , Ford , General Motors and various others . That the No. 1 trailer manufacturer was going in for stainless steel in such a big way was good New Year 's news for 27-year-old Edward G. Budd Manufacturing Co. , which made the first all-steel auto body in 1912 , first steel auto wheel in 1917 , * and has had its share of ups &; downs as a producer of transportation equipment . <P> Backbone of the Budd business is automotive , but that is relatively routine . The thing that stirs old Edward G. Budd and his veteran workmen in stainless steel is the sight of a gleaming new Diesel-powered ( by G. M. C. 's Electro-Motive Corp. ) streamline train rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. railroads . Last week , in the big , sprawling North Philadelphia plant , Budd workmen were finish ing up 50 streamline cars-for the Portuguese railway , Burlington , Santa Fe - and in the performance of streamliners already in service Budd could see the prospect of a lot more railroad orders in the years ahead . <P> That the streamliner has already given the roads a new hope is a feather for two caps . One feather is worn by Budd , the other by Pullman . When Pullman put out its first aluminum alloy Diesel streamliner in 1934 , Budd followed in just two months with a sleek stainless steel job . These two manufacturers went right to work to show the railroads that business could be won by fast , comfortable trains with new-type accommodations for coach travelers . <P> Operating on U. S. tracks at year 's end were some 85 streamliners , made by Pullman , Budd , American Car &; Foundry and in railroad shops . A few were still being pulled by skirted , dressed-up steam locomotives , but the best records were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hog and plumped for Diesel-electric power . Speeds had been stepped up enormously : Burlington 's Fort Worth-Houston and Chicago-St . Paul trains were running on a 66.6-m. p. h. schedule ; Union Pacific-Chicago &; North Western 's two City of Denver trains were averaging 65.4 between Chicago and Denver . Meanwhile , the low maintenance requirement of Diesel-light equipment was making shopmen 's eyes pop . As of Oct. 1 the two City of Denver trains had run 1,147,029 miles without ever having been laid up for shop repairs . Southern Pacific 's Daylights and most other streamliners had comparable records . <P> Well aware that streamliner speed would appeal to the railroads ' customers , light-train builders like Budd and Pullman cannily concentrated their major sales appeal on coach-passenger comforts . To get average travelers out of automobiles and buses , they made roomier cars ( 50 seats instead of 80 ) , softened upholstery , improved lighting , prettied washrooms and advocated stewardesses , an idea which the airlines had already exploited . The record of Santa Fe 's El Capitans proved that this was good salesmanship : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they turned in a revenue of $38,000 ; four months later it had jumped to $101,000 a month .
