Tapioca-pudding haters- numbering untold thousands of U.S. children and of still rankled grownups-got bad news last week . They had hoped that the Battle of the Pacific had cut them off for a long time from Java-grown tapioca . But the Department of Agriculture last week announced an understudy for tapioca , a new type of waxy corn developed by their plant breeders . Much relieved were industries which use tapioca for glue , and the Post Office Department , which uses it as a stamp adhesive .
