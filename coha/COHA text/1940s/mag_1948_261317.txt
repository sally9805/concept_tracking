TIME 'S Berlin Bureau Chief Emmet Hughes last week went to a gay party at the headquarters of the Polish mission in Berlin . Hughes cabled : <P> In dark Berlin , the lights blazed bright and late at a white sandstone building at 42 Schlterstrasse . From the second-floor balcony windows , the sound of scores of stamping feet and the melody of a rousing polka carried into the silent street . Beyond the curtained windows , in one of eleven rooms brilliant under crystal chandeliers , the hundreds of Berlin 's international set were being greeted by a short , thin man in uniform . His perfectly bald head with a wiggly scar on one side distracted their gaze from his soft brown eyes . He was Major General Jacob Prawin , chief of the Polish military mission . The occasion for celebration in this very unfestive city was Poland 's Liberation Day , a new national holiday . <P> End of a Chat . Here , for a few remarkable hours , the hunger of Berlin and the fears of the world seem as remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extravagant exchange of buffet-and-cocktail banalities-perhaps the only true international language . Bright Scottish kilts swish past the dull tan of Soviet uniforms ; a U.S. admiral 's navy blue is lightly brushed by the pastel veils of an Indian sari . Vodka , French wines and odd Eastern European cocktails spill on the oriental rugs from glasses negligently tilted or moved in too hasty gesticulation . There are lavish loads on two great buffet tables : platters of sliced veal and chicken , salads in splendid variety , tidy piles of caviar . In the center of one table is a roast pig ( with a tomato in its mouth ) which is gradually dissected by Soviet officers as the gay evening advances . <P> Yet , even as the orchestra alternates Russian dances and American foxtrots with admirable impartiality , not even common convention can dispel the uneasiness , like a chill draught from an unseen window , that stirs through the perspiring crowd . Three young men try hard : a bright-eyed British captain , a young American diplomat and a blond , slightly bewildered-looking Russian lieutenant who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his pockets as the other two systematically spoon up their mixed salad . Says the British captain : " I 've only been here two months but I really do like it . . . We certainly do n't get food like this at home . " To this the young Russian nods understandingly and vigorously and says simply : " Me too . " All seems to be going splendidly for a pleasant three-power chat till a dark , curly-haired Soviet major taps the lieutenant on the shoulder and murmurs something briefly . The chat ends abruptly , as the lieutenant looks back regretfully at his unfinished plate . The American shrugs.
