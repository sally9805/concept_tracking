A trainload of German prisoners chugged north through the Laurentians from Montreal , one day last week . One of them , a jug-eared , wiry young man , kept his nose pressed against the windowpane , his eyes on the bleak Canadian countryside . Baron . Franz von Werra , pursuit pilot with a score of 14 British planes , was a more valuable cog in the Reich 's war machine than most of his fellows on the train . And he intended to get back where he belonged . <P> After dark , the three guards in the car relaxed . Squadron Leader von Werra opened a window , jumped out , struck westward through the woods to a highway . His facile French got him a ride from a French-Canadian who could not see the German tunic under his passenger 's civilian greatcoat . Soon Franz von Werra was in Ottawa . There he begged a road map from a filling station , hitched a ride to somnolent Prescott . All that lay between him and freedom was the broad St. Lawrence . But at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark Werra stole a rowboat , paddled across to Ogdensburg , N. Y. There he was picked up by police on the tip of a suspicious service-station operator . <P> With his frost-nipped ears taped up , Franz von Werra was taken in tow by the German Consulate in New York City . Out on bond , he reported in Manhattan to see what would happen next . Since international law forbade the U. S. to return him to Canada , likelihood was that the Government would order him deported . How a deportation order could be carried out with Britain in control of the seas was a question resourceful Franz von Werra did not worry about . He knew that , to Adolf Hitler 's Luftwaffe , he was worth 20 times his $5,000 bond .
