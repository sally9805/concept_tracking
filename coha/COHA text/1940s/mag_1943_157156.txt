For Your Pleasure ( produced by George M. Gatts ) . A vaudeville restricted to dancing , singing and music , For Your Pleasure makes skill the handmaiden of monotony . By midevening the audience yearns frantically for a trained seal ; by evening 's end it would trade all the guitar players on earth for a gag-even a thoroughly bad and bewhiskered gag . <P> Headlining the show are Veloz &; Yolanda , whose sleek , accomplished ballroom dancing ranges from sambas to minuets , from pirouettes to parodies , but palls like any other meal after 13 generous helpings . Vicente Gomez is expert-and persistent - with a guitar ; Jerry Shelton is lively-and lavish-with an accordion ; Al &; Lee Reiser are energetic-and relatively brief - with two pianos . The Golden Gate Quartet harmonizes-and with not too much variety . Susan Miller sings-a little too close to the microphone . Bill Gary dances-a little too much like Paul Draper .
