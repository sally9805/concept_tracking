Even the strait-laced BBC has its wild &; woolly moments . The woolliest : 6:45 every week night , when British youngsters gasp at the well-planned perils of Dick Barton , Special Agent , hero of BBC 's only nonstop thriller. * Every night , just as death 's door opens , time 's up . " What will Dick do ? Listen in tomorrow night . . . . " <P> It was all many an adult Briton could bear-and it was too much for one W. Wright-Newsome . He took.his troubles , as Britons will , to the Times of London . Wrote he : " The BBC seems bent on turning the children into a new kind of drug addict . . . . The poor children grow more concerned from day to day about what Dick Barton . . . may do next than about their futures or the future of England . My neighbors confirm that when they turn him off . . . their children regard them as . . . tyrannic giants . " <P> That brought a defense for Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having emerged unscathed from fire and water , from the perilous lift-shaft and the homicidal ape , need fear little from this new assault . Surely , too , our children , having wrestled for one and a half hours with compound fractions or Latin verbs on top of a long day 's schooling , are entitled to their 15 minutes ' reward . Who grudges the bishop his detective novel or the businessman his nightly half-hour on the Times crossword ? . . . Heaven postpone the day when our priggish offspring forsake such unsophisticated thrills for the sober contemplation of their own importance in the future of planned economy . " <P> But ever-cautious BBC did not want to make an issue of it . Last week , in a move to appease parents and children alike , it offered a compromise : 1 ) Dick 's adventures would continue to be broadcast nightly ; 2 ) on Saturday mornings a brief resume of Dick 's week would be aired for youngsters barred from listening on school nights . To many a parent it seemed that Dick had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serials , 30 hours a week .
