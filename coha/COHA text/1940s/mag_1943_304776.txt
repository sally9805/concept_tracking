To the stomachs of 135,000,000 U.S. citizens , the Department of Agriculture 's monthly crop report last week brought bad news : <P> &gt;Prospects for the winter wheat crop had declined to 515,000,000 bu. ( from the 558,000,000 bu. of a month ago ) . <P> &gt;The Southern peach crop was expected to be about 9,000,000 bu. instead of last year 's 19,000,000 . <P> &gt;Prospects for the chief truck crops were 10% below last year . <P> &gt;The Department admitted less hope for record milk production this year . <P> Reason : April 's fitful weather . Pasture grass was off to a slow start . In the vast grain belt between the Rockies and the Mississippi , rainfall was 30% below normal . East of the Mississippi , late frosts had struck the peach trees and vegetable gardens . In New England , farmers were far behind in their planting . <P> But irreparable damage has thus far been slight . Given more rain and warmer weather , the nation 's crops can recover . Given bad weather , they can suffer further . Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report , tardy spring rains fell in torrents over much of the land . But in parts of the Midwest , the torrents were too great : farmers had the new danger of flood to contend with .
