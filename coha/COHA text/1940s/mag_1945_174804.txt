With only straggling general election returns still to come ( some had to be brought by canoe from polls in the far north ) , the new Canadian Parliament 's 245 seats were divided , at week 's end , like this : 128 Liberals ( including seven " Independent Liberals " from Quebec ) , 67 Progressive Conservatives , 28 CCFers , 13 Social Crediters , six Independents , two Bloc Populaire , one Labor Progressive ( Communist ) . * It meant that the 20th Parliament will be livelier than its predecessor . <P> The election left Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King and his Liberals conveniently in the middle of the road : when policy puts him under attack from the Tory , right , he can expect support from the CCF left-and vice versa . But the combined opposition is now strong enough to do some boat-rocking . No longer would the minority parties be prone to sit by , as grandstand critics , making noises solely for the record , taking little responsibility . With the Liberal Government 's former whopping majority cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation , more informed and useful debate . The Liberals would now have to mind their political knitting . Out would go the complacency that goes with a top-heavy majority . <P> One of the toughest problems ahead was Dominion-Provincial relations : how should control of such matters as taxation , national health legislation , natural resources be divided between Ottawa and the Provinces ? Before the issues could be settled , it might be necessary to rewrite Canada 's Constitution . Another problem was housing . The present acute shortage , aggravated by the return of servicemen , was not just a by-product of war ; it was the result of almost 15 years during which there had been almost no new building . The war against Japan was still to be won . Reconstruction and reconversion were just beginning . <P> To cope with such problems as these , Mr. King might soon streamline his Cabinet . Possible changes : i ) merging of the Ministries of Air , Defense and Navy into one new Ministry ; 2 ) consolidation of the Ministries of Finance and of Revenue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Progressive Conservatives 1,300,000 , the CCF 670,000 ( 277,000 more than in 1940 ) . Minor parties got the rest .
