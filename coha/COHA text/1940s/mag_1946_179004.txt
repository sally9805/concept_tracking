Four years ago , ship-bored sailors on a U.S. transport near Samoa ran across a ravaged English thriller . Its somewhat peremptory title : Kiss the Blood Off My Hands . The high-strung , blood- &-guts; story furnished so fine a busman 's holiday that they dismembered it , passed it around chapter by chapter . To their horror , they found that the last two chapters had gone overboard . <P> Most of the men went down with their ship in the Solomons without ever resolving their suspense . But two years later , one survivor was still scouring around after those last two chapters ( TIME , Nov. 20 , 1944 ) . He was out of luck unless he sent to England , where the book was published in 1940 , and sold 232,000 copies . <P> Last week Publishers Rinehart &; Co. ( who had read about the sailor 's trouble in TIME ) satisfied his curiosity and hoped to whet a lot of other people 's , by bringing out the first U.S. edition. * <P> In this story of thugs and trulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ) on every page to remind U.S. readers of James M. Cain . The complete , animal innocence of its hero-a sort of Id with pants down-is funny , scary , and fascinating . But the sailor is not going to like the two missing chapters . After raising the promise of Cain for the first 207 pages , Author Butler subsides into a tea-and-marmalade finish . <P> <P> *Kiss the Blood Off My Hands ; Gerald Butler ( $2.50 ) .
