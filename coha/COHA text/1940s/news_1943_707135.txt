txt Canners and farmers in western New York State 's vegetable and fruit growing counties think they have licked this year 's labor problem . If they have and if the weather is kind to them ( so far it has n't been ) they will see that the country 's armed forces and folks back home get as much as the 21 million cans of packed foods that were produced in this region in 1942 . Approximately half these canned goods are slated for military and Lend-lease purposes . It 's possible , they acknowledge , that somethuig may upset their carefully laid plans . The cold , wet spring threatens to push an extra amount of work into the usually busy July . However , experts believe it will be possible to pick and pack all the fruits and vegetables which will be raised in this area . Tomatoes and peas take top place in the volume of canning in this area , but there also will be smaller amounts of string beans . spinach , beets , carrots and applesauce . There will be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other fancy items this year . There may be few canned beets , either sliced , halved or quartered , because tin allocations have been cut for this farm product . and military forces will take most of what is packed . California expects to have a smaller supply of fruits this year , a survey of the May 1 condition shows . Story below . To solve the problem , farmers . canners , and farm labor agencies gave up the idea that some magic formula from Washington could produce the needed workers . Instead they decided it was their own immediate problem , and have worked it out on the basis of local demand and local supply . Therefore canners and farmers are n't depending on migratory labor this year , and they do n't expect to import many workers . They do count on a lot of help from high school students , and from adults who will pitch in when the pinch arises . Convenient Hours for Housewives The canners arc adjusting their working hours to the convenience of the folks who will give them a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their housekeeping while working in a cannery will have their choice of a " short shift " of four hours a day , a " splitweek shift " under which two shifts will work three days each week . There will be a " Victory Shift " provided for business men and others who can work only from 6 p m. to 11 p m or to midnight , or on Saturdays or Sundays In peak seasons , canneries normally use labor within a 10 mile radius , but there wo n't be enough in such a limited circle this year , so they are moving out to 30 or 40 miles away , planning to bring workers in by buses . These workers must eat , so catering to them has been put on a community basis . One plant at Oakfield . N. Y .. has taken over an abandoned restaurant which it plans to turn over to the women of a local church . They will serve meals each noon and evening , with all the profits going to the church . The canning company will supply only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year farmers did n't think they would be able to harvest all their crops , canners doubted they could pack all that would be grown . But canners had promised the Government that they would produce as much as they did in 1942. when the state turned out the 21 million cans . Did n't Know Labor Supply Everybody knew that there was a shortage of labor , but no one knew definitely how much was needed or how much would be available when spinach , peas , beans , corn and tomatoes ripen . The first part of the job of finding out just where the farmers and packers stood was to draw up a blueprint of the total labor required to harvest the crops and to can them . The second was to get an accurate measure of the workers who would be available for the busy season in July , and the all-out rush period in September . Wayne County , with 22 separate canning firms . and many different types of farmers , each having its own organization , was chosen as the proving ground for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers and the canners met with representatives from the Farm Bureaus and the U. S Employment Service to set up a committee for the entire country . This committee visited all communities in the county and asked every farmer and canner how much permanent and seasonal labor would be needed this year . All the figures on the amount of labor needed were combined into one total by the V. S. Employment Service . Then began a measurement of the labor supply . Block by Block Canvass From block to block , house to house . minute men asked householders what they could do to help relieve the farm and canning labor shortage . Newspapers put the need squarely up to the individual . Canvassers asked housewives what days of the wrek they would be available for the work , wAat hours were most convenient , how many workers ' children they ' could care for . what type of work they preferred , and whether they would work if child care was provided . Merchants agreed to close their stores on certain days , to release clerks for this work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or on Saturdays and Sundays . All the reports for the county were corns bmed. so that for the first time , both the farmer and the canner had a definite idea of what they could expect when the busy season rolled around . As a result of the Wayno County " guinea pig " man program , similar surveys were made in every agricultural county in the state . Canners controlling 96% by volume of the pack in the state now are covered by the arrangements to provide them wan labor D. Thomas Atterbury , labor relations adviser to the canners , says : " We think we have the problem licked with the aid of school authorities , provided the weather is kind to us . " The weather has n't been kind so far . however . Excessive rains . and the coldest weather in 60 years . have reduced early plantings , some of which never will be made up . Delay Means " Double Peak " This delay may mean a " double peak " season this year . September always is the big month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it may be equaled by July this year , because spinach and peas . usually cleared by July 10. are two weeks behind and will run over into the string beans and corn packing In planning their season 's operation= , canners have placed their needs at 5.090 workers in May . with a rise to 24 SOO to September and the possibility that the September peak may go to 30,000 . The Jude to October estimate cells for from 1,600 to 2,800 more workers than in the same months last year . Farmers ' estimates are n't complete yet . but Wayne County expects that 19,400 will be needed by September , which is 2 000 more than a year ago . Chautauqua County lgrapesi expects a peak of 11,000. while Orleans ( tomatoes , sees a top of 6.460 . Canners split their peak labor figure Into 13 900 women , 6,500 men for heavy labor . and 4.400 for light labor They fear the real shbrtage is ill be for heavy labor . Hign school students hired for canneries wo n't be expected to do the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Therefore , labor requirements call for 41 high school students to do the work of 18 men . The school 's contribution to the labor supply is illustrated by the " help the farmer " plan inaugurated in the fall of 1941 by the Ontario-Gorham-Potter Central School near Geneva At noon each day when their services are needed , children over 16 who have the consent of their parents , leave in school buses to help harvest crops . Farmers pay the school directly for the work done , and school authorities make out the payrolls and pay the children Even the teachers who supervise get a chance to add to their income by working Out of the 220 enrollments in the school , between 130 and 140 took advantage of the hence to work last year , and collected $4.000 for their labor . Wages will be higher in canneries this year . Economic Director Byrnes has Just issued a directive which will allow the canners to pay the higher wages they aslicd . Last year , women workers got a minimum of 40 cents an hour . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : men got 50 to 60 cents minimum in 1942 , and this will he upped to 60 to 70 cents this year .
