PART SIX WHEN Franklin Delano Roosevelt brought the New Deal into the White House during the great depression , it seemed as if everyone in the country was looking for a job except the new President and myself . Both of us had our hands full and then some . During the last days of the Hoover Administration the White House had been becalmed in a period of waiting , and my job of handling the President 's mail had been comparatively routine , with only a few hundred letters a day coming in . With the arrival of F.D.R. , we suddenly had action , new faces and Roosevelts all over the place , and so many tons of mail that , as I will explain later , we had to establish an entirely new system for handling it . Mr. Roosevelt always showed a keen interest in the mail , and kept close watch on its trend . Nothing pleased him more than to know that I had to build up a big staff and often had to work until midnight to keep up with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received regular reports on what was coming in , and frequently we sent him unusual letters , from which , with a fine knack for publicity , he would pick out material for newspaper stories . Whenever there was a decrease in the influx of letters , we could expect to hear from him or one of his secretaries , who wanted to know what was the matter . Was the President losing his grip on the public ? Everybody in the executive offices was keenly aware of the value of good public relations , and there was a lot of emphasis on proper handling of letters and information for the newspapers . Steve Early , the press secretary , was the sort of expert who could and did interrupt the President 's talks with reporters to order , " Do n't say that " or " Do n't answer that " and make it stick . But not everybody could be as experienced or as skillful in saying the right thing at the right time , and frequently we had some amusing complications in connection with the President 's desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the White House in those troubled days . On one occasion a cement worker in California wrote to Mr. Roosevelt and said that he had an exhibit of unusual craftsmanship which he wanted the President to see . Miss Margaret Le Hand , the President 's personal secretary , wrote a pleasant letter saying that Mr. Roosevelt would be " interested in your exhibit . " ( Continued on Pnge 1 ) 9 ) Nobody gave it another thought until some weeks later , when a stranger came into the office and told me he had just arrived from California to erect an exhibit for the President . He said he had the exhibit outside , and where could he put it up ? I went to the door and saw a huge truck pulled up at the curb . " Just hold everything , " I told him . I checked up the correspondence and talked to the man about the size of his exhibit . Then I advised Miss Le Hand that her invitation had been accepted , and where did she want the exhibit Pot ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basement of the office , and he began unloading large and complicated pieces of cement that looked like a cross between the Lincoln Memorial and a Coney Island roller coaster . He sweated and fussed around for a week , and finally put together a structure that was about eight feet by eight feet and reached almost to the ceiling . Apparently it was a castle in miniature . It had electric lights , music by radio , bells , chimes and water that ran through the miniature rooms and into moats and over falls illuminated by Colored lights . He had to use a network of hose and wires to get the thing into 0 . peration , and fuses were always blowing out or the water overflowed or something . The day he finally put it on display we went out to look , and it was fantastically unreal , with music playing , bells ringing , lights flashing and water swirling all around . Then it developed that the creator of : this little number was in real life the builder of elaborate fish pools and similar decorative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endorse his creation , which he hoped to put on exhibition in various theaters . Mr. Roosevelt would not even go to look at It , and it was eventually carted back to California on a freight car  --  at quite an expense to the builder , but to the great relief of Miss Le Hand . Of all the new presidential aides , ' Ouis Howe was probably the most unusual ; certainly he was the strangest Presidential secretary I ever knew . He was , of course , so ill that he would not ' list long , and he seemed to realize it . A Slight , thin-faced man , he never wasted a word or a motion . He obviously tried to conserve his waning strength , and never lifted a hand around the office if he could avoid it . He did n't even sign all his own letters . He mostly seemed just to sit and watch and listen , and I sup-Pose he was Mr. Roosevelt 's most valuable adviser . Without seeming to do anything , Howe kept close track of everything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary wandered into 11.13 " office , possibly on Howe 's instruc " uns , and in the course of a chat asked ine what I really thought of the President . Now , I considered Mr. Roosevelt one Of the most remarkable men I had ever Seen operating at close range , and all of us Were glad to see that , at last , we were Setting some action around the White ' louse . But her question obviously was a bit more personal . My impression at that time was that the President was *always playing hichatty like a good ac- r . He Was jovial , and informal , and this struck me as an almost proitessional attitude of good fellowship . " e could turn on his dazzling smile as if iinrnebody had pressed a button and sent a brilliant beam from a lighthouse out across the sea  --  shining on whatever ship happened to be there . I never felt , as I suppose most people did , that there was anything particularly personal about his manner toward me , and why should there have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be the most politic man I ever saw . " She looked at me in amazement , and then bristled with indignation . She stoutly denied that my observation was even partly correct . She obviously felt that whenever Mr. Roosevelt gave her a pleasant look , it was something very specially reserved for her , and I think the President had the ability to make that impression on most persons , both great and small . I do n't mean that his friendliness was insincere . I mean it was just a charming knack that he used almost subconsciously . He could even do it over the radio , much to my distress . When he advised millions of listeners in his fireside chat to " tell me your troubles , " many , many thousands of them believed implicitly that he was speaking to them personally , and immediately wrote him a letter . It was months before we managed to swim out of that flood of mail . The President 's most prolific correspondents , strangely enough , were two well-known characters who also called on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace . Both of them wrote to Mr. Roosevelt frequently and at length . In fact , at one time it got so we could expect a letter from Ickes on some subject or other almost every day at three o'clock in the afternoon  --  presumably after he had wrestled with an idea at the luncheon table and then had time to get it down on paper . Ickes always impressed me as an outstanding Secretary of the Interior , but he could n't possibly mind his own business . His letters covered a wide field of subjects and were especially frequent during the period when Mr. Roosevelt was pushing the Supreme Court packing bill . Wallace 's letters did not cover so wide a range , but had little to do with his own department . He wanted to run the State Department by giving advice directly to the President on how to handle foreign affairs . A unique chara  --  ter who made his appearance around the White House during the Roosevelt days was George Allen , whom F.D.R. made a commissioner for the District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President had agreed to permit the use of his name by the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis , of which Basil O'Connor was president . He said a little stunt had been arranged to raise money for the foundation in connection with the President 's birthday and that it was being suggested on two radio shows  --  Eddie Cantor and the Lone Ranger  --  that people send dimes to the White House as contributions . " It 's all very unofficial , of course , but keep your eyes open , " Allen said . " You may get a trickle of dimes in the mail . " It was a remark I 'll never forget . Botb Cantor and the Lone Ranger did talk about the campaign on their shows , and the Lone Ranger urged kids to send a dime each to the President for use in fighting infantile paralysis . Two days later , the roof fell in .. . on me . We had been handling about 5000 letters a day at that time . We got 30,000 on the day The March of Dimes began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got 150,000 the third day . We kept on getting incredible numbers . EVENING POST and the Government of the United States darned near stopped functioning because we could n't clear away enough dimes to find the official White House mail . I yelled for help as soon as my staff could get the bags full of dimes piled up enough to let me get out of the office . We got fifty extra postal clerks , but we still could n't find anything but scrawled and finger-marked envelopes from every kid who could get his hands on a dime . Picking out the President 's official mail was like looking for a needle in a haystack . Replies to invitations which Mrs. Roosevelt had sent out for a formal dinner were buried under tens of thousands of letters from all over the United States and Canada . She did n't get them until two weeks after the dinner . We began sending bags of mail to the offices of the various presidential secretaries , and they dug into them in search for important letters they were expecting . Judge Rosenman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. James Roosevelt volunteered to help . The stenographers and anybody else available spent all their spare time fumbling through huge stacks of letters , many of the staff voluntarily working hours of overtime without pay . The offices , desks and corridors were stacked with mail sacks and we had to put police on special duty each night when we finally closed up and went wearily home . It was days before we began to restore some kind of routine and it was four months before we had cleaned up the debris . Being completely inexperienced in such enterprises , we had to devise a special setup to handle the 2,680 , - 000 dimes that rolled in during the campaign . The first wave of response in 1938 was largely from children because the Lone Ranger had emphasized the idea of putting a dime in an envelope and sending it to the President . Every time we emptied a mail bag eight or ten dollars ' worth of loose coins that had cut through the envelopes would fall out . Then , as the idea grew , dimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . I developed a deep bitterness toward persons who used gummed tape to stick coins on a card . Every dime we received in such manner had to be washed in a special solution  --  we finally found that fire-extinguisher fluid was best  --  before the Treasury would accept it . Other dimes were received in a wax design the size of a football . We had to boil it down . Thousands were baked into birthday cakes . Once we had to break up a concrete brick loaded with coins . A woman who wanted to contribute , but had no money , had her hair cut off and sent it in with the suggestion that we sell it . It brought eighty dimes . We received an aluminum cane made of tubing into which were jammed 650 dimes . A gallon can containing $300 arrived from a bomber squadron . One donor punched a hole in a dime  --  making it worthless  --  and tied it with twine to a huge cardboard tag , labeled The White House . I sent it around for Mr. Roosevelt to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new dime to go into the collection , and a note saying : " I hope you have a good dime . " One of the clerks kept the President 's dime to give to his grandchild as a memento , putting another in its place . I did n't tell him that , as usual , Mr. Roosevelt had no money in his pocket and that his secretary had furnished the memento coin . January 22 , 1919 During the rush of dime mail one of our biggest jobs was just counting the money , but later we merely weighed it after separating the silver from the checks and currency . Then I would send it over to the Treasury in an armored car , with two Secret Service men carrying tommy guns , and they would give me currency to turn over to the foundation . Later we got an Army truck and guard to deliver the silver . The campaign grew , and we received more than $1,500,000 in 1945 . People still kept thinking up spectacular ways to deliver dimes , however . In one publicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles , where they had been contributed by listeners to a radio program . The trip cost $670 , whereas a check could have been mailed for three cents . Upon arrival , the people in charge wanted to present the coins personally to Mr. Roosevelt . Part of the silver was put on the elevator , but the load was too much and it would n't move . The publicity stunt was a bit overloaded , too , and ended at that point . After the first year , we made special preparations for The March of Dimes , taking on extra clerks in January and * * * * * * * Women have recently bawl , placed at a disadvantage ; man rail now travel faster than sound . ? EDP : fill ARMS . * * * * * * * * * * keeping them until we cleaned up the work in March , but I never saw George Allen after that without a shudder ; a " trickle of dimes , " indeed ! After Mr. Roosevelt had the executive offices rebuilt to provide more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure except the Cabinet room and a part of the President 's office . The rest of his office was directly over storeroom , which was divided in the middle by a wire partition that formed a cage where we put many of the thousands of odd gifts that came to the White House . A ventilator leading to the President 's office was inside the wire cage , which was securely locked . One day the Secret Service men came to me and said they were worried about the ventilator , which opened outside the building . It might , they said , occur to some crank to plant a bomb in the ventilator , since it was under the President 's desk . They said it had been decided to make some structural changes to eliminate the possibility . They took a key to the cage , and in the next day or so workmen arrived and began making changes . The next time I went into the cage I took a look at what they had done . A wooden partition about six by ten had been constructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cage . It had a door that was securely padlocked . I was curious about it because it was the strangest bomb-prevention device I could imagine . One of the President 's most skillful stenographers did his work in the basement offices near my desk , and had 0 key to the wire cage . I noticed that be frequently went to the cage , and one day when I was there , he came out of the little room . The door was open and I saw a small desk and chair inside . nodded to the stenographer . , " Oh , " I said . " Got a machine in there , eh ? " He laughed . " I was just getting some reports from upstairs , " he said . I did n't say anything more , but I noticed that the stenographer frequently went to the little room , where he obviously took down whatever conversation went on in the President 's office We never discussed it , and I guem my staff kept on believing the Secret Service story about bomb prevention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Deal and the Roosevelts were always thoughtful of the staff . The President received hundreds of birthday cakes each year , and he would pick out one of the grandest and invite everybody in for tea . Mrs. Roosevelt usually came , too , and sometimes brought her own guests . The President seemed to enjoy these breaks in the routine , and he made everybody feel at home . On one occasion when the cake was brought in , he remarked that it was a Particularly handsome one . Then , with a twinkle in his eye , he turned to Gennerich , a Secret Service man , and said in a commanding voice , " Gus , bring me George Washington 's sword that I may cut this cake ! " Everybody loved it , and the girls all gasped , but when it came to cutting the cake , the President used an ordinary knife . Most of the girls on the staff secretly wrapped their slices of cake in handkerchiefs to take home . I ate mine . It was very tasty . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buoyancy that was felt by those who worked with him , and even by those who saw him only occasionally . But ( 1,11ring the terrible years of the war : ' resident was a drastic change both in the the and in the atmosphere around e White House . Mr. Roosevelt soon : became absorbed in the long-range war and postwar problems and gave less and Jess attention to immediate political and governmental questions at iorne . Matters which he would have handled personally during his first two terms were frequently delegated to Subordinates , and this led to blunders , quarrels and misunderstandings . Many letters , particularly from members of c , , ? ngress , came to the White House in " 38e days , complaining that affairs of Politicalimportance were being neg-it.eted or were being bungled ? in Strange contrast to the White House ? Perations prior to the war . It has always seemed to me that Mr. Itaosevelt 's withdrawal in order to devote himself to war problems may have ? Pened the way for later charges that e  --  rumunist-minded persons had infil-t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acute a politician in halt times to fail to foresee and h t conditions which later gave rise to , i , ligressional investigation of alleged the spying . But in the war days " e President was preoccupied and in-tuited to shove such matters aside or ave them in the hands of others in or-der to devote himself to grandiose ' cihal planning . i This was true before we actually got t " to the war but , when Pearl Harbor ratue , the trend was drastically intensi- fist ' . There was also a sudden and arrfastic change in all White House underground A bomb shelter was built Oerground at the east end of the th , iite House and everybody got a gas - " k ? We were lectured by Army ' era and had regular air-raid drills . lialveryborly had to keep his gas mask pohis desk , and every so often the fire 0g8 would ring the air-raid alarm and or Would assemble in specified offices drill . my office was one of the aspoints , and I was in charge there , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . Soldiers were moved into the barracks south of the old State Department Building , and a guard line was established around the White House . At intervals a patrol , fully armed , would march around the grounds , changing the guard , which was maintained day and night . The wartime secrecy and precautions for protection of the President added considerably to our work , especially since many new figures , both military and civilian , were suddenly thrust to the foreground of governmental affairs . A good number of them had strange ideas about what should be " top secret " or " for the eyes of the President only . " This was especially true of the State Department , which was overcrowded with young squirts who thought that anything that passed through their hands or was received in code was too secret for anyone but the Chief Executive to see . It took us quite a while to convince them that it would be all right for us to handle translations of birthday messages and similar communications from foreign dignitaries even in wartime . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FBI and if there was the slightest suspicion he was removed or transferred . We had one girl of foreign descent in our office who caused some concern . One day the Secret Service came around and asked me to hold out any mail addressed to her at the White House . " There 's something funny going on , " I was told . " This girl has been using White House stationery to write to a fellow in New York  --  a foreigner who apparently has some connections with the I. G. Farben Company in Germany . " I do n't know what else the Secret Service did to investigate the case , but they certainly watched her mail . They even went through the wastebasket by her desk every evening after she left the office . One evening they found it full of half-written letters , all of them crumpled up into balls . When they were smoothed out and read , it was obvious that she had been having a quarrel with the New Yorker and just as obvious that she was trying to compose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or she was using an interesting code language . As far as I know , the only thing the Secret Service discovered was an unsuspected love affair , but just to be on the safe side , the girl was transferred anyway . ' The tenor of mail to the President changed after Pearl Harbor . I recall that , before we got into the first World War , many pro-German letters came to the White House . There were pro-Germans on the White House staff at that time , too , and they did n't hesitate to express their opinions , because most Americans had considered the European struggle in 1914 of no concern to us as a nation . But the second World War found Mr. Roosevelt strongly opposed to the Axis from the beginning , and this position was reflected in the mail . There were many protests against war in general , but letters favoring the Axis were few and far between , while large numbers of persons wrote in to praise the President or to urge a still stronger stand . After Pearl Harbor there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get excited " and not to " rush headlong into war , " but by the time these arrived we were already at war and the mail room was overburdened with Sheppard Diesels stay on the job .. . without overhauling ... 3 to 5 Limes longer than ordinary engines .

At this time , someone spread the idea that the Government needed fine human.hair in manufacture of bomb sights , and we received enough contributions to make a rope stretching from Washington to Berlin . We sent them over to the Bureau of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The strain on the President and those close to him sometimes seemed almost unbearable in the early days of the war , but Mr. Roosevelt stood up under it far better than most of the others . We saw him less often because of tight wartime regulations and pressure of work , but during the first year he merely seemed a bit older and , naturally , less jovial . After that , it began to be apparent that his condition was deteriorating , and there was a good deal of concern about his health before the 1944 election campaign , when he continued to suffer from periodic cokes and failed to bounce back as in the past . People began writing in to ask about his condition , but the official position of the White House was always reassuring . I would not , of course , pretend to any knowledge of medicine , but strictly from the viewpoint of a layman who occasionally saw the President , it seemed to me that the White House was not always completely frank with the public in regard to Mr. Roosevelt 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reassuring and to avoid causing alarm .. Furthermore , the state of Mr. Roosevelt 's health was of tremendous importance in international affairs at that critical point in world history . These things obviously entered into the reassuring White House and other authoritative statements , but we knew the President was not his old self and we could not avoid feeling that some of the truth was being concealed . In January , at the beginning of F.D.R. 's fourth term , my wife and I received a note from Presidential Secretary Early inviting us to attend a service of intercession on the twentieth . We arrived at the White House that Saturday just as General of the Army George C. Marshall and his wife went in , and we were all taken immediately to the East Room , where rows of chairs had been arranged in a semicircle . The ladies of the Roosevelt family sat together just in front of us , each of them carrying a bouquet of violets . Mrs. Roosevelt 's was enormous and the perfume was strong in the room . The choir from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where their robes made a warm spot of color amid the display of flags . The President sat in the center of the front row , and beside him or behind him were the great names of his Administration ; the great names of a bitter war that was just turning toward a day when victory could no longer be denied . It was a friendly gathering , yet solemn and full of portent , as if these men realized that the tragic years of war now nearing an end were only the beginning of the test our country must face . Mr. Roosevelt must have thought , too , of his impending journey to the Yalta conference . The choir sang " 0 God , our help in ages past ... be Thou our Guide , " and there were prayers for the President of the United States and for our country and for our enemies and for victory . When the services ended , we stood very silent for a moment , and then for a few moments more as we waited for the President to depart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair was brought in by an attendant , but , almost impatiently , he motioned it away . Everyone watched and waited , and still the President remained in his chair . His daugh- ' ter , Anna , turned to face us and smiled . With a little shrug , she seemed to say , " Well , he has something on his mind . " Finally , without a word , Mr. Roosevelt turned as if he had awakened from a deep reverie , and beckoned to us . We all seemed to understand what he wanted , and we formed a line that filed past him , so he could shake hands with each one . When I stepped close to him , I was shocked to see how tired and ill he looked ; how gray and old and thin he had become . He did n't say anything . Just shook hands . The death of Mr. Roosevelt , nevertheless , was a shock to all of us . I had been inclined to draw a comparison with Woodrow Wilson 's illness and to fear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The news flash from Warm Springs , therefore , was as much a surprise to us as to the rest of the world . For weeks after Mr. Roosevelt died , we received letters demanding an investigation of his death and suggestions that there had been foul play , but , of course , none of them was based on any knowledge of the facts . After the death of the President at Warm Springs , Mrs. Roosevelt asked all of the staff to come around on April twentieth to say good-by . Mrs. Beet-tiger , James Roosevelt and his wife and Faye Emerson Roosevelt were with her . When we returned to our desks , a few of us found there one of the countless little trinkets with which the President had always littered his own desk . Mrs. Roosevelt had sent them around as mementos . Mine was a little gray donkey . EVENING POST The next day President Truman asked us into his office . It was a shock , after so many years of F.D.R. , to see the office denuded of its ship models , flags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesslike , and urged us to do as well for him as we had for Mr. Roosevelt . But the atmosphere had changed . Mr. Truman 's self-styled chief secretary , Ed McKim , seemed constantly to worry about whether the staff was capable of " keeping things confldential " ? something we had been doing satisfactorily for a good many years . McKim brought in a couple of special investigators who had worked for the Truman Committee in the Senate , to check on whether the whole setup was airtight . Nothing happened on whatever they may have reported , but McKim shortly moved to another job . General Vaughan , the President 's military aide , and Commodore Vardaman , the naval aide , came up one day with the idea that they would handle all the President 's contacts with veterans , presumably on the theory that there was political gold in them hills . Among other things , they ordered that all mail from veterans and servicemen be turned over to them instead of being forwarded to the various departments for answer . This gave me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time we were getting letters from veterans and servicemen who wanted to know what had happened to their insurance , when they would get a bonus , when was their discharge coming through , where could they get jobs , why could n't they get a house to live in , and where in the hell was the wonderful postwar world they had been told about ? The next morning I carefully laid out 600 such love notes Januar ! . 22 , 1919 from soldiers and veterans , and sent them around to General Vaughan . He took one look and asked , " How long have these been accumulating ? " " That 's just the morning mail , " he was told . I must say the general reacted rapidly . " Take . ' em away , " he ordered , and that was the end of his handling of the veterans ' mail . Commodore Vardaman heard about Vaughan 's experience and canceled his order for the mail from Navy veterans , before he even got the first batch . The only time I ever had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made George Drescher , who had been his guard when he was Vice President , the head of the White House detail . George was a big jolly fellow who had always been easy to get along with . About this time , however , I had arranged to remodel a garage in order to use it as a receiving room for the mail department , and I had the approval of Howell Crim , who was then in charge of White House buildings . Drescher apparently did not get along with Crim , and he vetoed the plan , which had to be approved by the Secret Service . I asked him why . " Well , " he said , " there might sometimes be riots around here and we would want to use that garage as a place in which to conceal soldiers . " This seemed to me to make very little sense , but we probably never would have got the idea okayed by the Secret Service if George had remained in that job . Before he left , however , an amusing little thing happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one occasion when she was in Missouri , the President sent around word that we were all invited to an affair in the East Room . The Broadway comedians , Olsen and Johnson , were the principal stars , and they went through their zany stunts with enthusiasm , but failed in their efforts to get Mr. Truman to play the piano . It was an uproarious occasion and it was the first time I had been in the East , Room since we attended the intercession service at which Mr. Roosevelt was present . As we left , my wife went out first . I noticed Drescher , big and broad , standing just outside the door , but nobody else seemed to be around to say good-by . I had just said , " Hiyah . George , " when I saw a hand reach out from behind him and catch the arm of my wife , who was heading on down the hall . She stopped and peered , and then blushed . By the time I was up even with George , she was shaking hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his huge Secret Service man . The Truman were very folksy , although somewhat uncomfortable people when they first moved into the White House . They found that living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue was n't the same as living at home . They discovered that a great many people can not resist the impulse to write a letter to the President  --  an American phenomenon that I want to tell about in the next article in this series . Mr. Truman fretted under the weight of his new burdens and it took him quite a while to decide he liked being President . He kept close track of how the mail was running . It was pretty high at first , but he was especially interested in whether it ran as high as Mr. Roosevelt 's average . I always had to say that it didn't.
