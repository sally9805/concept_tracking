Dignitaries and former Resistance leaders last week plodded across muddy fields to the remote hamlet of Bruneval in Normandy . There , at a ceremony to honor a British commando raid , Charles de Gaulle came out of retirement and opened a campaign to recapture power . <P> " The tide goes up and down , " said De Gaulle . " Perhaps it is in the course of nature that a period of clear and gigantic efforts should be followed by a period of obscure fumbling . But times are too difficult , life too uncertain , the world too hard to enable one to vegetate too long in the darkness without risk of succumbing . " Then De Gaulle lashed out against the French parliamentary system and the new constitution . Said he : " The day is coming when , rejecting sterile games and reforming the badly built framework of the country . . . the immense mass of the French will rally to France . " <P> Socialist Patriarch Lon Blum snapped back that the savior of the Republic spoke against the Republic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has now begun , " he wrote . " Without reservation . . . the Socialist Party will be on the side of the Republic . " The moderate MRP 's an Assembly debate to forbid Army officers to listen to De Gaulle . Worried about the increased danger of civil war , Socialist Premier Paul Ramadier paid a hasty visit to De Gaulle . In his white-walled villa , over black coffee , " le grand Charlie " tried to reassure Ramadier . " I am no Boulanger , " * De Gaulle said . Ramadier was taking no chances . The two men agreed that henceforth De Gaulle would be a split personality . At official functions De Gaulle , the hero and ex-Premier , would be nonpolitical . On other occasions he would say what he pleased . <P> On Easter Sunday , at the Government-sponsored unveiling of a plaque in Strasbourg Cathedral to the American dead in Alsace , De Gaulle appeared as hero . Thousands jammed the rainswept streets to cry " De Gaulle au pouvoir ! " ( De Gaulle to power ! ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaulle said : " If a new tyranny should ever menace all or part of the world , we may be certain that the U.S. and France would be together to oppose it . " <P> The next day , as a private citizen , De Gaulle spoke more explicitly to a packed square before Strasbourg 's City Hall . He cried : " It is time that a grouping or rally rassemblement of the French people is organized , which , within the legal framework , will be able to cause ... the profound reform of the state . " <P> If economic conditions worsened , and France 's uneasy coalition Government of Communists , Socialists and Catholics cracked under the strain , millions of Frenchmen might turn to De Gaulle again . <P> <P> * Romantic General Georges Ernest Jean Marie Boulanger was the dominating figure in French politics in 1888-89 . He fled before the Government could arrest him for a plotted royalist coup d ' tat . In 1891 he committed suicide on his mistress ' tomb in Brussels .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
