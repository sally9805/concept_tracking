Some strange things happened last week in Juan D. Pern 's Argentina . In a country ruled by a man who is regarded by most of the world as the Strong Man , not everything was running on schedule . The first intimations of trouble came at the constitutional convention , which was expected to whip out a Peronista constitution in jig time . <P> At the start , everything seemed shipshape . Evita Pern planned to stage-manage the convention as if it were a Peronista rally . Inspecting the high-domed Congreso a few days before the convention opened , imperious Evita acted as if she owned the place . She announced when she would speak , decided where she would sit . She had already proclaimed that she would furnish some of the convention props . Among them : a portrait of Argentina 's Liberator Jos de San Martin , a crucifix , a vellum-bound copy of the Gospels , and most important , a chair of native pipiribi wood with President Pern 's portrait , the Argentine shield , and the Peronista party emblem painted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew how the signals got switched , but Evita abruptly called off her speech to the opening session . When the pipiribi chair was placed on the rostrum , the Peronista party emblem had been hastily covered with a piece of ordinary leather . Obviously somebody had decided that a party emblem was not a proper ornament for a convention representing the entire Argentine people . <P> Even that change did not satisfy Opposition Delegate Moises Lebensohn . In a bristling speech which Convention President Domingo A. Mercante did not try to stop , he denounced the plan to bring Pern 's portrait into the chamber . " Neither in France , Great Britain nor the U.S. has it ever occurred to anybody to place a portrait of the chief of state in the halls of parliament , " he shouted . <P> " Not even in their years of dictatorship did Mussolini and Hitler dare display their pictures in their stage-managed parliaments . I was about to say that I did not know of a single case where this is so , but I am mistaken . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country in which the President re-elects himself time after time-the republic of Santo Domingo . Its national parliament is presided over by the photograph of Dictator General Doctor Rafael Leonidas Trujillo . " Cries of " May bien , muy bien " and loud applause rang through the chamber . <P> In the Paper . That afternoon , while government speakers droned on , Convention President Mercante , who is provincial governor of Buenos Aires and one of Pern 's closest friends , met with Peronista leaders . Shortly afterwards , the majority floor leader , Angel Miel Asquia , came out to tell the press that they had decided to drop the proposal to let a President succeed himself . <P> Veteran reporters demanded proof . Miel Asquia waved a paper at them . A reporter from Noticias Graficas grabbed it , examined it minutely . Sure enough , it carried the names of such party stalwarts as Mercante , Hector Campora , chief of the capital 's Peronistas , and Miel Asquia himself . Every newspaper in Buenos Aires , including Seora Pern 's Democracia , reported that Article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go unchanged .
