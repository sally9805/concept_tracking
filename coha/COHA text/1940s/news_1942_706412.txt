txt Oil and chemical research men , working on synthetic rubber . are embarrassed by the tact that they have the key to a magic cupboard filled with treasures , and scant time to explore it . They are haunted by the knowledge that new test-tube discoveries lie just around the corner Specifically they are afraid that any new synthetic rubber plant built today may become obsolete overnight . It bothers the chemists and engineers to set up an industry to make good synthetic rubber . which they now can do , when they know that before they can get it working they arc almost bound to find a way to make a better synthetic rubber . Normally the pattern of research is to follow good ways by better ways , with plenty of time for tests and orderly development . But war calls for production instead of experimentation There is n't time to wait for the latest new ideas Yet new ideas are born faster than ever . Talking of Future Plants For example , although the first half of this nation 's 700,000 ton synthetic rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the armed forces must have an ample supply of rubbet soon . regardless of cost , the remainder of the program may await development of new ideas If it could be called delay . It is a strategic delay actually designed to attain the final goal more quickly . There is a good possibility that a synthetic rubber plant started six months hence will come into production more quickly , provide a much larger output and cost a great deal less than any already under construction . Chemists are talking today of future plants which might double the quantity and cut the cost in half . There is also every reason to believe that the quality of the synthetic rubber that will be turned out finally will be far superior to any of the types made now . This is simply the rule of synthetic chemistry . Synthetic rubber Is an aiganic chemical . which means that it is composed mainly of carbon and hydrogen molecules , just as natural rubber is made up of these qualities . Organic chemicals can he made from coal or fiom oil or from vegetable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw material source of synthetic rubber . " Buna " Main T3 pc The main type of synthetic rubber planned under the U. S. program is called - bum " which starts with a basic raw material called butadiene made chiefly fro mpetioleum . The other ingredient is styrene , widely used as a plastic and which is made from either coal or oil Butadiene is one of the hundreds of organic compounds which are found in petroleum or made by re-arranging the petroleum molecules . There are excellent pi ocesses for making butadiene. now in operation , processes which involve several laborious and expensive steps of piecing the molecular building blocks together However , in half a dozen laboratories , all of which have been concentrating on this vital problem for the last year or so , several startling new synthetic rubber methods already have been found Big advances are being made in quality . For example , while better butadiene-making processes are under way it has been found that it may not be necessary to use butadiene at all to make rubber . There arc other petroleum compounds , other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better types of rubber than the buna type . Broadening A.pprouolia to Problem Then there is the matter of coal . Organic chemicals of course can be made from coal as well as from oil . Coal tar is the basis of many established chemical industries . New methods are being worked out to use coal tar as a base for rubber , thereby broadening further the approach to the problem . There is also the whole vegetable kingdom to consider . One of the original ways of making butadiene was by starting from alcohol which is made by distilling grain It would be possible to make large amounts of it by making increased amounts of alcohol . Alcohol can also be made from many farm products . In view of the present large demands for alcohol in other industries . new uses for it are not likely to be developed soon , however . Incidentally synthetic raw rubber calls for new processing . materials . It needs different plasticizers , different solvents , and more and better carbon black than natural rubber . Supplies of all these are likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not overlook .
