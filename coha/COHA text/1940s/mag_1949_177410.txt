THE WELL OF THE PAST ( 221 pp. ) - Charles Norman-Doubleday ( $2.75 ) . <P> This is a simple story of a New York boy of middle-class background who becomes a poet , sails to South America and back on a freighter , has a love affair with a girl in Greenwich Village , and goes to Paris . It is one more report on that special subdivision of the American Dream in which poets , artists , musicians and other emancipated spirits defy the Philistines , have love affairs without tears , and go forth alone to meet a hostile and uncomprehending world . <P> Author Norman 's story is a tale of Greenwich Village innocence , before Stalinism and Sartre , when , by his account , the villains were no worse than money-making poetasters , when there was lively talk in gay Bohemian cafs , and when a hero could stalk wrathfully from a meeting of the Poetry Association . <P> Charles Norman pretty certainly knew the kind of people he has written about in this , his first , novel . At 44 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small volumes of poetry himself . The Well of the Past is a gently idealized version of the Manhattan ' 20s ; yet Author Norman writes so carefully of the quiet life of David Gerald , and follows his simple and unpretentious thoughts with such detached sympathy , that the portrait ends by being impressive . This , he seems to say to the reader , was all that the Greenwich Village-Paris rebellion , in most cases , amounted to ; in retrospect , it was nice people living a sensible existence of good taste and moderate pleasures . <P> Probably Novelist Norman 's hero also had reserves of character somewhere , but nothing ever quite happens to prove the point , one way or the other . In this , as in the effectively drawn picture of David Gerald in love , the book may be true to its time and place ; the result , nonetheless , is of David Gerald in a partial vacuum .
