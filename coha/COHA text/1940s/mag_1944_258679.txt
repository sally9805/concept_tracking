The most bodacious example in the U.S. of the plushy Victorian architecture variously known as jigsaw , gingerbread or General Grant , is the mammoth , decaying , 917-room United States Hotel at Saratoga Springs , N.Y.* Two years ago , the old " States " foundered in white-elephantine failure , closed its doors forever . Last week the entire furnishings of this ornament of an age went on the auction block . It was a great day for the fanciers of the art of the ' 70s and ' 80s . <P> The event attracted droves-townspeople , tourists , buyers from Texas and Michigan . They climbed the wide , stone front steps flanked by two enormous iron urns , to view the treasures inside : crystal-and-brass chandeliers , a heaving sea of mildewed objects , corniced walnut wardrobes , marble-topped bureaus-some 10,000 numbered items , stacked in the halls , standing in the serried , airless bedrooms . A dozen garlanded chinaware cuspidors clustered beside a bundle of lace curtains . Metal Indians and painted washstands stood on the vast drawing-room floor , while a gleeful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Tribute and Love 's Stratagem leaned in steel engraving against a parlor wall . There were objects nobody could explain , such as a waisthigh , samovar-like receptacle of tarnished silverplate sporting an impudent spiggot . There were even sales tickets on the coiled hempen ropes down which no one had ever had to make a fire escape . <P> Heroic Ugliness . Horn-rimmed Auctioneer Harry Loree moved from bedroom to bedroom , followed by a herd of bidders . In each room he mounted a chair , addressed his audience in machine-gun auctionese : " I have eight dollars bid for the pier-mirror eight dollars eight dollars eight dollars SOLD to what 's the name please ? " Prices were middling : $25 for most of the marble-topped dressers , $3 to $50 for figured carpets , $20 apiece for twin brass beds . One of the 888-ft. long red Axminster carpets from a hallway brought $1 , 600 . For the two florid front-lawn urns a dealer paid $50 , for an unsigned Hudson River School painting , $50 . <P> Such prices were not unimpressive considering that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its ugliest days . Had the United States Hotel been furnished 20 years sooner it would have caught the end of the gracious early-Victorian style-and its contents would have brought untold sums last week . As it was , few collectors and decorators wanted the garish brocades and machine-carved chair-and-sofa sets on the auction block . Records showed that most of this fusty flotsam had come from Manhattan 's great A. T. Stewart department store , predecessor to John Wanamaker 's . But no records showed who had designed the pieces or the hotel itself . One guess was that the hotel 's builder-one Seymour Ainsworth-had styled his building by the contractor 's sample book , simply slapping , on brackets , gables , machine-cut wooden columns and arches .
