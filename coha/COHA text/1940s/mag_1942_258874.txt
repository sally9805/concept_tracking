One of the biggest New Deal messes has been the housing program . The mess finally got so frightful that even Franklin Roosevelt , who can stand more clutter around him than most men , waved his arms and shouted for his chief housekeeper . Rotund little Judge Samuel Rosenman grabbed dustpan and broom and waded in . <P> Sixteen government agencies-for planning , building and financing houses-were heaped together in a formless pile . Somewhere under all this trash was a record of eight years of peacetime housing bungling , of a year and a half of defense housing bungling . Hundreds of thousands of badly needed houses were still being drafted or just being argued about . <P> ? Recent WPA reports showed that available housing was more than 95% occupied in all but 25 of 287 war-industry areas surveyed . In most cases , less than half of the vacant houses were habitable or for rent . <P> ? In Connecticut , of nine areas surveyed , eight were almost 100% occupied . <P> ? By summer , when vast new war plants opened up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltimore , where shipbuilding , oil and chemical workers looked in vain for nearby houses last week , was an indication . Officials wondered what would happen when the expected 18,000 new workers moved in . <P> ? By the end of the year , Detroit expected that its worker population would be swollen to 600,000 , nearly double normal times . The area around Ford 's vast Willow Run plant , which will take 100,000 workers , was already overtaxed . <P> <P> " Amazing Executive . " With OEM 's Wayne Coy holding the dustpan , Judge Rosenman went to work with his broom . In spite of the gestures of hydra-handed Commerce Secretary Jesse Jones ( among many other things , administrator of housing loans ) , the Judge swept up the 16 Federal agencies . Mr. Roosevelt announced last week that the mess was cleaned up . <P> A new bureau , the National Housing Agency , will manage all Federal housing activities . One new boss , John B. Blandford Jr. , will take the place of the many bickering bosses in the old setup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections : 1 ) building ; 2 ) guaranty of mortgages placed by private banks ; 3 ) financing of home ownership . <P> Blandford , an Assistant Budget Director , is leathery , square-faced , married , childless . At 44 he is a veteran administrator . As general manager of TVA for six years , he helped bring order out of confusion . Mr. Roosevelt called him an " amazing executive . "
