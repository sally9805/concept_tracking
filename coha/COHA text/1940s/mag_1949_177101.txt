After two lean years in a Hollywood jungle that has never been more perilous . Eagle Lion-the first addition to big-time U.S. film studios in 14 years-was at last making good . Under able President Arthur B. Krim , a 38-year-old lawyer who tackled his job with virtually no movie experience , E.L . has become a model of efficient , cost-cutting operation . It has kept down overhead by steering clear of long-term contracts with high-priced stars and directors . Periodically , it has shut down until it could prepare four to six films for almost simultaneous ( and thus economical ) shooting . On the average , it has managed to squeeze about three pictures ( best example : the well-made quickie , T-Men ) out of $1,000,000 . <P> Heartened by its first profitable period in two years , E.L . last week ended its third shutdown by starting work on four films . The outlook was brightened by the box-office success of The Red Shoes , one of the films it has been distributing for <P> Britain 's J. Arthur Rank , who suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For British pictures the company has also developed an audience in 200 to 250 cities . <P> Eagle Lion 's new vigor also springs from a deal with David O. Selznick to distribute nine of his " classics " ( e.g. , Rebecca and Intermezzo ) , three of his current films and possibly two new ones <P> ( Portrait of Jennie and the British-made The Fallen Idol ) . <P> One E.L . handicap : it has had to get along without its own theaters , which older , richer studios have found to be a cushion against bad pictures and production losses . Now , with the Federal Government winning its campaign to force bigger companies to divorce production from theater ownership , E.L . ' s experience in licking the handicap has a chance of turning into an advantage .
