txt B. , Ca Ole to THE NEW YORE ' riares . LONDON . March ** Minister Churchill told the House of Commons today that the restriction of travel between Britain and all of Ireland was merely part of the first step designed to isolate southern Ireland from the outside world during the critical period of the war ? that is approaching . Another part of that step , the Prime Minister said , is designed to isolate Britain from southern Ireland , where Axis agents have been receiving important information about the Allied war effort . Mr. Churchill used the words " first step , " implying there would be other steps , but he did not give any clue as to what these would be . He also evaded a direct answer to a question as to whether the frontier between northern and southern Ireland , across which hundreds of persons travel daily , would be closed . Questioned by Conservative Mr. Churchill began his speech after a question raised by Sir William Henry Davison , Conservative , of Kensington . Sir William wanted to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate protection against the danger that valuable information would reach Eire , which he called " a center of espionage . " Sir William also asked if the British Government had other measures in mind . Mr. Churchill said the initiative in the latest Irish developments had been taken by the United States because of the danger to American armed forces from the presence of Axis missions in Dublin , but that the British Government had been consulted and had given the American Government full support in its request for the removal of the German Minister // BRITAIN PLANNING TO ISOLATE EIRE // and the Japanese consul from Eire . He went on : " The restrictions on travel to Ireland announced in the press yes- terday are the first step in a policy designed to isolate Great Britain from southern Ireland and also to isolate southern Ireland from the outer world during the critical period which now is approaching . " I need scarcely say how painful it is for us to take such measures , in view of the large numbers of Irishmen who are fighting so bravely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which they have kept alive the martial honor of the Irish race . Britain 's Patience Stressed " No one , I think , can reproach us for precipitancy . No nation in the world would have been so patient . In view , however , of the fact that both British and British dominion lives and the lives of soldiers of our Allies are imperilled , we are bound to do our utmost to obtain effective security for the forthcoming operations . " There is also the future to consider . If a catastrophe were to occur to the Allied armies which could be traced to the retention of the German and Japanese representatives in Dublin , a gulf would be opened between Great Britain on the one hand and Southern Ireland on the other which even generations would not bridge . " The British Government would also be held accountable to the people of the United States if it could be shown that we had in any way failed to do everything in our power to safeguard their troops . " Sir William Henry Davison then asked if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eire-Ulster border should be closed " in view of the activities of IRA Irish Republican Army which had declared war on Great Britain and in view of the fact that members of it recently have been apprehended with papers giving particulars of the American forces at present in Ulster and with certain plans of their operations . " Obviously unwilling to disclose any further measures under consideration , Mr. Churchill replied : " I prefer to confine myself to a statement in general terms today . All necessary measures within the limits which I have described will , of course , be taken as they are deemed necessary . "
