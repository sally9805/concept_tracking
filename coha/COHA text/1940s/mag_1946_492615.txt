This is How it Was By COL . JAMES P. S. DEVEREUX , USMC Ax Told to Lt. Comdr . J. BRIAN , 111 , As the long-awaited Jap landing parties surge over Wake at night , a lone 3-incher guts two Nip destroyers . Scantily equipped , badly outnumbered , the Yanks fight hand-to-hand in darkness , but at dawn a white flag goes up . PART TWO HEN the Japanese attacked Wake Island with carrier-based planes on December 21 , 1941 , and again the following day , we knew that a landing was imminent . We had beaten off their attempt on the eleventh , but since then bombs had destroyed a lot of our defense equipment , and we had lost the last of our Wildcat fighter planes . Beating off the next attempt would be tough . Waiting for it to develop was tough enough , although the wait was only a few hours . Soon after dusk on the twenty-second , we saw flashes out at sea . They were so brilliant and continued so long , we thought  --  and hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them were northwest of us . They seemed to be nearing Told Point , and around midnight word was passed over our warning circuit that the Japs were landing there . I phoned Lieutenant Kessler , commanding the battery at Told , for confirmation . He reported , " There are plenty of lights out here , but that 's all . " " Any boats been beached ? " " Negative . " We notified all installations that it was a false alarm , but 2nd Lt. Arthur A. Poindexter , commanding my mobile reserve , had already started for Told to oppose the landing . " My mobile reserve " sounds impressive ; it consisted of eight men and four .30-caliber machine guns . Poindexter 's road led past my command post , so I was able to intercept him and hold him there until the situation clarified . It did so at 1:20 A.m. , when the .50-caliber machine guns on Wilkes opened fire at a noise on the southern beach , and the dim glow of their tracers showed a boat of some sort close to shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His only available searchlight had been badly damaged when the dynamite dump exploded on the tenth ; its beam lasted just long enough to reveal a Japanese landing barge in front of F , the 3-inch AA battery which had been left unmanned for want . of personnel . L Battery 's 5-inch guns could n't bear on this section of the beach , so Platt ordered its crew to deploy as infantry , with rifles and machine guns . While the machine guns were being brought forward , McAlister sent a sergeant and a private down to grenade the barge . In ten minutes the private returned , wounded . He reported that the sergeant had been killed and that neither of them had been able to get close enough to throw their grenades aboard . This was my last report from Wilkes . The cable connecting us went dead . Meanwhile , other reports had been pouring into my CP . Many of them were contradictory , . but toward three o'clock it became evident that the Japs were concentrating their main effort on the southern shore of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A Battery , on Peacock , was ineffective at this angle , so our only defense was our machine guns and the single 3-inch AA gun which we had left at the south end of the air strip when E Battery moved up to the lagoon. 2nd Lt. Robert M. Hanna volunteered to man this gun . Since a couple of machine gunners would be his only protection , I sent Putnam to support him , with all the men he could collect at the strip , and I ordered up a gun crew from D Battery on Peale , because D had been useless as AA ever since a bomb had destroyed its director . Hanna 's gun had no sighting guides . All he could do was point it in a general direction . Fortunately , he had a target almost at his muzzle  --  two Japanese destroyers which had just beached . He opened fire at once , gutting both ships completely , but they had already begun to land troops , and he had time to get off only fifteen rounds before a hand-to-hand fight was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his force , including Captains Tharin and Elrod , and had taken up a position between the beach and the gun . From here they were driven back to the emplacement and surrounded . For the next six hours those twelve marines fought for their lives and for that gun . The truck bringing their reinforcements , the gun crew from D Battery , reached my CP at 3:30 . I showed the corporal in charge where Hanna 's gun was located and told him to get his men there on the double , but he had hardly crossed the air strip when he was met by machine-gun fire and forced back . Poindexter 's mobile reserve was also falling back . I had ordered them to form a line at the west end of the strip , which was lightly defended , but troops landing between them and Camp One threatened to outflank them , and they had to withdraw down the beach . By now  --  say , 4:30 ? the Japs had put about 1100 men ashore , 300 from each of the two destroyers and 100 from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barge on Wilkes were sixty marines . Opposing the 1000 on Wake were about eighty-five marines . The rest of our military were scattered around Wake and Peale in zones which did not come to combat . The Japs on Wake pushed inland until those on the east ran into a heavy crossfire from two machine guns at the east end of the strip and two on the northern side of Peacock . Their losses were tremendous , but a corporal on the guns phoned me that he needed reinforcements desperately . I had to tell him to retire . I had no reinforcements . There were only three men in my CP  --  one operating the switchboard , one on the warning net , and myself . Potter had taken the rest , plus whatever others he could find , to establish a line about 100 yards south of us , to delay the advance as long as possible . My only resort was to order Godbold and the remaining men of D Battery to come over from Peale . They arrived as dawn was breaking and went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty men . The worst of ou ? weakness was the confusion . Communication with Wilkes bad failed early , and Camp One and A Battery were cut off soon afterward . All but one of our walkie-talkies had been dead since the early bombing &; I could still reach Cunningham by phone , but his CP was a mile north of mine , and he was even more dependent on reports than I was . As a result , rumor ran riot . A hysterical civilian rushed in to tell me that all hands at a certain machine-gun position had been bayoneted . This was false . Someone else reported that Jap flags were flying over Wilkes . This was true , but Wilkes had not been captured ; the flags were battle standards , although I did n't know it at the time . By 7:30 it looked to me as if the Japs had secured Wilkes , Camp One and the air strip , and were eating their way into the rest of the island . I reported this to Cunningham . He said slowly , " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was shocked . I had n't contemplated even the possibility of surrender . I was still hoping for reinforcements . I said , " There must be something we can do . Is n't any help coming ? " No No friendly ships within twenty-four hours . " " Not even submarines ? " " No . Not even them . " I began to realize that his decision was inevitable , and now that I have had four years to consider it , my opinion is firmer than ever . I said , " I 'll pass the word . " I notified every installation that I could reach by phone and told the men to destroy their weapons . They fired the big guns with blankets stuffed into the muzzles , then dropped grenades down the barrels . To clinch the job , they cut the control cables and shot their pistols into the dials , range keepers and telescopes . Hearing the firing , and knowing what it meant , nearly broke me up . I had seen physical death many , many times in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second kind , the death of pride , the death of the heart , One of Godbold 's sergeants came into the CP . He looked at me for a moment and put out his hand . " Do n't worry , major , " he said . " You 've fought a good fight and done all you could . " A few minutes later Lewis entered and reported . " Sir , the guns and fire-control equipment of E Battery have been destroyed . " His men were with him . I said to them , " I do n't know whether any marines have ever surrendered before , but those are the orders , and they 'll be carried out . " Then I told one of my communications noncoms  --  Sergeant Malleck ? " Put up a white flag . " Planes were still bombing and strafing , and I could hear the rattle of rifle and machine-gun fire . It was vital for all hands to be advised of the surrender as quickly as possible . I knew that the Japs had penetrated close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 400 yards in advance of my CP , so I tried to phone the doctor in charge , Lt. ( jg ) G. Mason Kahn , to raise white flag and , if he could make contact with a Japanese officer , to give him the word . When the hospital did not answer , I told Malleck to fix another flag  --  one that he could carry  --  and the two of us started down the road toward the battle line . The flag over my CP was a bed sheet . The flag we took with us was a rag tied to a swab handle . The location of the hospital , nearer the line than my CP , may sound odd . The explanation is that after our original hospital in Camp Two was bombed , we had to find a more secure place for our sick and wounded . A series of four magazines on the east side of the strip recommended themselves because they were strongly built and were partly underground . The first and fourth  --  the only two that were empty at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shank , and the military hospital . The second I eventually took as my CP . The third continued to be used for bomb storage . Malleck and I had gone about 100 yards when we met the Japanese point , the leading man of their advance . He understood the white flag , but insisted by gestures that I drop my helmet and pistol belt and empty my pockets of everything but a handkerchief and my wallet . Malleck even bad to take off his shirt before we were allowed to proceed , with the Jap following us . Continued ed on Page 52 ) tion . I climbed onto a revetment and shouted , " This is Major Devereux I The island has been surrendered ! Cease firing ! Put down your weapons ! " No answer . I shouted again and walked closer , until our men could see me . A few of them came out . Putnam looked like hell itself . He had been shot in the jaw , and his whole face was smeared with blood . His first words were , " Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Captain Elrod was one of our best and bravest fliers . His eyes were open and he was clutching a grenade . He had been about to throw it , Putnam said , when a shot through the spine killed him instantly . Another marine had also been killed , and nine of the remaining ten had been wounded . The World Fair jg separated the three officers , Putnam , Tharin and Hanna , . from the men , and left both groups under guard at a place near the gun , which seemed to be the Jap headquarters . The rest of us continued toward Camp One . On the way we found Lieutenant Kliever in a revetment , trying to operate the exploder for the dynamite buried under the strip . Thank God he had n't succeeded while we were crossing it ! Even if I had escaped the blast , the Japs would have murdered me and all other Americans in reprisal for what they would have considered an act of perfidy . The escort gathered in Kliever and the crews of two .50-caliber guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners in our party . Half a mile farther toward Camp One , we came up on the rear of about fifty Japanese engaged in a small-arms skirmish with troops we could n't see . Our white flag was flying , yet a number of the Japs deliberately turned and fired on us , and twenty or more of them charged us with bayonets . The sword-swinging jg , who was commanding the escort at the time , managed to stop the charge , but he let them push us around and turn out our pockets . That 's when I lost my wallet with a photograph of my wife and my son , Paddy . The Japs simply thumbed through our things and threw them away , money and everything else . The Flag Comes Down Now Poindexter came up the road with the mobile reserve and the additional men he had mustered , some twenty in all . After his flank had been threatened to the west of the strip , early in the morning , he had fallen back and re-formed and fought his way forward against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't grasp what had happened . He thought that the Japanese were our prisoners . The truth was a terrible blow , but his reaction was typical of many men whom I have seen under strong emotion . He snapped his fingers and said , " Oh , shucks ! " We marched on , picking up a few more men . From time to time the World Fair jg would take command of the escort , then drop behind again . The guards were making us keep our hands in the air , but as soon as the jg arrived , he told us , " Put them down . " A few minutes Later a guard rapped me with his bayonet and motioned for me to raise my hands . I did so , but the jg told me to lower them . He and the noncom argued back and forth , countermanding each other . It was the first of our many experiences with the unique discipline of the Japanese military . As we drew near Camp One , the esx3rt .  --  ) ied our flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the ilagpole was shot away . At once they broke into a run , yelling and cheering , and one man swarmed up the tower . I was afraid the sight would goad our men to something foolhardy , like a bare-knuckle banzai charge . I ordered , " Hold it ! Keep your heads , all of you ! " And we stood there and watched a grinning enemy cut our colors down , and stuff them into a camouflage net , and bring them to the ground . Under Fire Again Camp One bordered on the small-boat channel where we had anchored the dynamite barge . It was still there , saw . My communication with that end of the island bad been lost early in the morning , so I had n't been able to order the barge blown up , and the man on the exploder bad hesitated to assume the responsibility alone . Now that we had surrendered , I told the Japanese about it . Nothing could be gained by concealment , and an accidental explosion might cost us heavily . The sword-swinging jg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat dock and told me he wanted me to take him across the channel . The boat he chose was a fifty-foot motor launch . I had ridden hundreds of miles in fifty-footers , but I had never operated one , and I could n't start the engine . A Jap crew had no better success . The escort , looking on , had been showing increasing arrogance for some time , shouldering us and cursing us . Now they became not only mad but suspicious . They thought it was a scheme to keep them from Wilkes . Luckily , I recognized the captain of one of our small tugs in the crowd of prisoners , and I explained that he could get us across . The Japs consulted . Thirty of them finally embarked , but they made sure that Malleck and I were well forward , where our white flag would be conspicuous , and they held their machine guns at the ready . It was about 10:30 when we stepped ashore on Wilkes and started down the beach toward Kuku . I shouted , " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down your arms ! " Nobody answered . I shouted again , adding , " Do n't try any monkey business of any kind ! " We saw nobody and heard nobody . Wilkes seemed deserted . The only activity was offshore in the Japanese task force . Twelve destroyers lay within a few hundred yards of us ; beyond them were four huge heavy cruisers , and still farther out were three transports . Dozens of launches and landing craft were shuttling between the big ships and the beach . We had walked about half a mile when I saw a flash from one of the destroyers , and a shell burst at the water 's edge on our left . I could n't believe they were firing at us . Our white flag must have been plain at so short , a distance , even if they could n't see that their own troops were armed and we were not . When the second shell burst , somewhat closer , it was obvious that we were the target . If I had been sensible , I would have thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept me from it while the jg was still on his feet . The third shell burst fifty yards away . That stimulated him to do what he should have done at the first burst ; be told us to take shelter , and sent a signalman to give the destroyer the word . Presently the signalman reported back . The escort re-formed and we resumed our march  --  with an even lower opinion of Jap gunnery . At intervals I continued to shout , " The island has been surrendered ! Put down your arms ! " but we were halfway to Kuku , almost at the new channel , before I saw any troops , some of Platt 's Olsen . They came from behind their cover reluctantly , followed by Platt and his two officers , McAlister and Gunner McKinstry . I told them , " We have surrendered . " Platt said calmly , " Yes , sir . " His account of the defense of Wilkes , given in a quiet South Carolina voice , was almost casual . He said only that he had converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until every Jap on it was either dead or a prisoner . He had started with sixty men and had lost ten killed and eight wounded . The Japs had started with 100 , he reckoned , and had lost at least ninety killed , including four officers . I could easily believe it . I counted thirty bodies around F Battery alone . When the escort saw them , they pointed and jabbered . And hearing the jabber , one of the " bodies " stood up . The man had been wounded , but by no means severely . This was a favorite trick of theirs . Elrod had been killed by a Jap who was also playing possum among the dead . Two of Platt 's prisoners were trussed up beside his CP . One , released , ran to a body nearby . " Mylbrother ! " he said , and burst into tears . I patted his shoulder , and many of us told him we were sorry . Our sympathy made him blubber all the more . We began to revise our conception of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found . We had already gathered all the Americans on Wilkes , so we turned back along the northern shore . Here we came on the body of a Japanese lieutenant , far from any of his troops . The jg reached into the dead man 's pocket and pulled out a flag and covered his face . McAlister remembered when he was killed . One of his gunners had said , at first dawn , " Hey , there 's a Jap officer over there ! Shall I shoot him ? " A sergeant answered , " Certainly , you damn fool ! Or give me your rifle and I 'll do it , " That 's how he died , but what had brought him there alone we could n't guess . An abandoned truck stood a bit down the road . The jg ordered Platt , McAlister , McKinstry and me to get in and drive to the new channel . Here we met several hundred more Japanese , who had just landed , under command of a full lieutenant . We did n't understand what the jg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his giggles reflected an unmistakable nervous relief , presumably that our tour had been accomplished without incident . The lieutenant 's mood , however , was far from giggly . The looks he threw at us were black scowls . I imagine that word of the heavy casualties had reached him . While the jg was making his report , two stretcher bearers came up with the soldier who had been playing possum . Somebody had given me a canteen , so I offered it to him . When we had seen him back at F Battery , he had fawned on us for , as we thought , sparing his life . Now that he was among hundreds of his people , he pushed the canteen aside contemptuously . The two Jap officers finished their talk , and one of them motioned for McKinetry to get back into the truck . Mac asked me , " What are they going to do ? Shoot me ? " I said , " Nonsense ! You 've got nothing to worry about . " I felt sure he would n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what he got . Mac had not bad sleep for twenty-four hours , but they kept him driving for another twenty-four , and whenever he dozed off , they woke him up with a bayonet . Meanwhile , Platt , McAlister and I were ordered to walk to the small-boat channel in the custody of a warrant officer who followed us at fifty paces . I did n't like that . I kept remembering the troops who had charged us that morning , and I wanted an officer right with us . However , we had no trouble until we reached the landing , where we saw one of Platt 's men , desperately wounded . We urged the warrant to let us take him over to Wake for medical attention at once , without waiting for the rest of the prisoners to be assembled . He pretended not to understand us . On the Wake side of the channel we found some officers who spoke English , but they were arrogant and hostile . They were n't concerned about our wounded , they said ; they had wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Page 56 ) // ( Continued front Page 54 ) A crowd collected during this conversation . Among them we noticed one Jap much burlier than the others , wearing a tremendous sword in a black scabbard with tie-ties of black cloth . Platt asked him what the sword was for , why it was so big , The Jap would n't answer ; he merely smiled . I could have told Platt . It was an execution sword . The landing-force commander , the navy captain with the wounded hand , was on the outskirts of the crowd , talking with Commander Cunningham , Commander Keene , and several other American officers . I saw them climb into a truck , so Platt , McAlister and I joined them . A guard stood on each running board , but they did n't pay us much attention . They were n't worried any more about our making a break ; they realized that our surrender was sincere . We drove up to the Jap headquarters near Hanna 's gun , and Keene drew diagrams for the commander , explaining Wake 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . The commander took over the pad and pencil to write one question , " Where are women 's quarters ? " A FRENCHMAN MUST DIE ( Cantimeed from Page 32 ) " So you have come to Louveau to be measured for a suit ? " Mitchie asked , and there was silence on the landing for a moment . Mitchie stood watching the young man , who smoked quickly , uneasily , at the cigarette that he held pinched between his broad forefinger and thumb , " Yes , exactly , " he said , speaking the slow , heavy , careful French . " Go on then , " said Mitchie , and he jerked his chin toward the stairway . " Go on up ahead of me . " The young man hesitated a moment , as if be might still seek the way out , and then he turned , pulling jerkily at the cigarette , and he began to mount the stairs . He mounted without haste , and Mitchie came behind him , and on the third-floor landing he halted . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the bell . " They estimate about eighty thousand , " Mitchie said in a quiet voice , and he stood looking in speculation at the young man , who had dropped the end of his cigarette to the boards now , and who rubbed its fire into ash with the toe of his shoe . " Eighty thousand Germans in civilian clothes still obeying orders , still circulating with false identity papers , giving false addresses , still trailing Resistance men . " The speculation in his voice had ceased completely . " Still sniping , still working with what is left of Darnand 's militia and the remnants of Doriot 's party , still taking your orders from the underground Fascist radio . You are armed ? " he asked , keeping it steady and cool " We can not talk here , " the young man said . He said the words nervously , scarcely aloud . " If we could discuss it when we are inside ? " He seemed to be about to move to Louveau 's door , but , meeting Mitchie 's steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from where he stood , the tall , slightly stooping , slightly withdrawing figure in the open overcoat , took cognizance of the approximate degree of strength in the shoulders ' deceptive slope , and the dexterity of the wide , hanging , unpigmented hands . " Everyone goes armed these days , " the young He was astonished when Keene wrote , " No women on island . " We had n't been sitting there long when the Jape offered us some canned food . I fell on it . It was now around two P.M. , and I had n't eaten since six o'clock the night before . Chewing the raw fish , I suddenly remembered an incident in Washington the past January . My leave had been canceled out of the blue , and I had been ordered to return to San Diego immediately . One of my brothers saw me off at the station . " What 's all this rush ? " he asked . I said , " The battalion is moving out , I guess . I do n't know where , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Then what ? " " I do n't know that either , " I said , " but I may be eating rice and fish before long . " I have no idea why I said it , but eleven months later , there I was . Not only was I eating enemy rations but our island was lost , scores of us were wounded or dead , and the rest of us were prisoners . Maybe part of my despair came from exhaustion . I had n't slept for days , man said , and his light eye moved from Mitchie 's eye . " You can give me your gun before I ring , " said Mitchie ; and perhaps in calculation or perhaps merely in the deliberate marking of time before he would have to speak , the young man 's canny glance examined the width and breadth of Louveau 's door , determined , it might be , the distance that lay between it and the stairway , and then he shook his head . " You can trust me , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plea , and he watched Mitchie 's right-hand pocket , certain of what the hand thrust in it held . " I am not what you think I am , " he said . " I am not working with them . At the time of the retreat , I got rid of my uniform and I stayed behind . I did n't want to go back to Germany , not with the Nazis in the saddle , so I stayed here in France , " he said . " And then today you decided you needed a well-cut suit ? " said Mitchie . The young man hesitated a moment , and then he said , " No . That is n't why I came . " He did not look away from Mitchie 's right-hand pocket as he talked . " I came to Monsieur Louveau for help . I 'm afraid of the others  --  the SS and the Darnand men . I could give Monsieur Louveau the information I 've picked up from them , and in exchange he might get me away . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , " Are you the American ? " he said . " Does it matter who I am ? " asked Mitchie . " Yes , because I want to work with you , with you and Louveau against the others , " the young man said . " They 're after me now , the way they 're after you , the way they 're after Louveau . They 'd shoot you down , if they could , the way they 'd shoot Louveau and me down , " he said . " But from us you have nothing to fear , " said Mitchie , " so you can give me your ? " " No , " said the young man scarcely aloud , and his eye moved again from Mitchie 's eye . " That I ca n't do ... no . " As he put his hand inside his open coat , Mitchie believed that he saw the mouth alter in shape , the lower lip tighten across the teeth , and before the hand and whatever it might portend and I had just walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands in the air . Whatever its source , it drained me dry of hope and strength . And then I saw something I will never forget : a group of enlisted marines coming up the road , with Technical Sergeant Hassig as right guide . Hassig was a short , broad man with a crisp mustache . It had always bristled with a special challenge , and now it was more defiant than ever . It seemed to set the tone for the men . They were n't slouch. ing along dejectedly . They marched straight out , heads up and eyes front . Their guards had to trot to keep up with them . I felt my spirits soar . I looked at the Japanese around us . Their faces showed a mixture of admiration and bewilderment . What kind of men are these Americans , that they can still keep their courage and their self-respect ? In the long years to come , they often protested , " But you do n't act like prisoners ! " They never understood . Editors ' Note  --  This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bryan . The third will appear next week . was free of the coat again . Mitchie stepped forward , and the knuckles of his closed right band struck the hard young chin . He heard the crack of it , saw the head jerk back , and as the gray of the irises floated loose in the milky white of the eye a moment , the young man reeled backward against the wall . But Mitchie was beside him , and he hooked his right arm through the two limp-hanging arms in the light sleeves of the overcoat , and he held him upright before him , advancing him , puppetlike , to Louveau 's door . The legs hung flexible as spaghetti before his own legs as he walked , and he jolted them forward with the alternately raised butts of his knees . At Louveau 's door , he pushed the bell button with the thumb of his left hand , and he waited , supporting the other man against him like a drunken man without will or consciousness , holding him upright in unspeakable grotesque of compassion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest upon his breast . Almost at once , Louveau opened the door , narrowly , cautiously , but at the sound of Mitchie 's voice , he flung it wide . Mitchie crossed the hall into the fitting room , jerking the legs of the young man , like a paralytic 's legs , before him , and before the three-faced mirrors he swung him down upon the chair . There he ran his hands quickly , expertly , over the inert figure , and from one pocket of the jacket he removed the revolver , and he broke it open at the hinge and emptied the ammunition from it , letting the beads of lead pour as easily as sand through his funneled fingers into hisown pocket , and he tossed the empty gun upon the table with the tailoring pins . " Sent here to have a shot at you , " Mitchie said to Louveau , and he jerked his chin toward the German . Through the thickness of his lenses , Louveau 's eyes had come abruptly upon the shoes the young man wore . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are ! Take them off him . I 'll deal with him later , but you take his shoes and go . " He had gone hurriedly to the hall closet and he brought a length of rope back , and he made a noose and slipped it over one of the young man 's hands . When he had drawn it tight at the wrist , he jerked the young man 's arm behind the chair , " Get the shoes off , " he
