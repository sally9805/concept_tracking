txt The microfilms of secret Government documents found in a pumpkin shell on the Maryland farm of Whittaker Chambers , confessed pre-war courier for a Communist espionage underground , remained hidden and untouched for ten years in a residence at 260 Rochester Avenue , Brooklyn , N. Y. , the House Committee on Un-American Activities was told today . Testifying was Nathan L. Levine , attorney for Mr. Chambers and Mrs. Chambers ' nephew . He said Mr. Chambers had asked him to hide them at a time when Mr. Chambers " had a morbid fear of being liquidated by the Communists , " with whom he had broken in 1938 . Mr. Levine said that Mr. Chambers instructed him to deliver the package to Mrs. Chambers if anything happened to him . " I asked what I should do if something shoild happen to her also , and he said : ' You are an attorney and will know what to do , ' " Mr. Levine told the committee . This testimony , sought by the committee to establish whether the documents had been removed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mr. Chambers had sworn , was given in a din of other developments in the sensational Hiss-Chambers controversy . Rivalry of Groups Continues The Department of Justice and the House group remained belligerently at loggerheads over jurisdiction over witnesses appearing before the committee and the special Federal grand jury in New York which is investigating Communist activities . Their race for first call on witnesses continued , with the jury apparently winning two heats during the day . William Ward Pigman , a 38-year-old chemist formerly employed by the Bureau of Standards , where secret weapons and other military devices are tested , was subpoenaed by the jury for appearance tomorrow . This took precedence for a telegram sent by the committee last night , requesting him to show up here today . The second man cited by Mr. Chambers , Henry Julian Wadleigh , a former State Department employe , refused to answer questions yesterday on the ground of possible self-incrimination . Mr. Pigman has been identified by committee members as a third man named by Mr. Chambers as a supplier of Government documents to him when he acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hiss Brothers Kept In New York Alger Hiss , former State Department official and now pres/-dent of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , and his ' brother , Donald Hiss , were subpoenaed by the committee for a hearing tomorrow . However , the New York jury decided to sit tomorrow and required the Hiss brothers to stand by for possible recall . Mr. Chambers has accused the Hiss brothers of having been leaders in the underground and Alger Hiss of having been a principal supplier of documents to him . Both have denied the charges . The committee decided late today to release twelve of the microfilmed documents for publication in Sunday morning newspapers . These twelve , it was emphasized by Representative Karl E. Mundt , acting chairman , had been " cleared " by the State Department " as to present national security . " Mr. Levine , the committee 's witness today , said that he dill not know the contents of the package handed him ten years ago until last Friday , after committee investigators were handed the films from the pumpkin by Mr. Chambers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package completely , until three weeks ago last Sunday . Then , he said , Mr. Chambers , whom he had not seen for four years and had seen only four or five times in the last ten , went to his home at 960 Sterling Place , Brooklyn , and asked for the package . Mr. Chambers explained , the witness said , that he wanted the package in connection with ' the $75,000 libel suit filed against him by Alger Hiss . Mr. Levine said he had difficulty recalling what Mr. Chambers was talking about . Then he recalled , he said , and they went to the home of his mother on Rochester Avenue , where he had lived at that time . For a hiding place , his testimony ran , he chose a former dumbwaiter shaft which had been converted into linen closets . He had hidden the package on top of the closet installed on the second floor of the house . To reach the hiding spot , Mr. Levine explained , he had to go out a bathroom window into an airshaft and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , was dirty , deep under dust , but , he emphasized , the seals had not been broken , nor had the elastic bands around it been disturbed . While Mr. Chambers went to the kitchen , Mr. Levine said , he washed his hands in the bathroom . When he went to the kitchen , he continued , Mr. Chambers had , opened the package , and as he entered exclaimed : " ' Holy Cow ! I did n't know that this still existed . ' " Report to Recalled Mr. Levine drove Mr. Chambers to the railroad station but still did not know what was i , n the package , the witness related . Last Friday , when news of the removal of documents from the pumpkin was made public , Mr. Levine said he " put two and two together " and at once called the office of John F. X. , United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York . Federal Bureau of Investigation agents questioned Mr. Levine . On the following Monday he appeared before the special grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levine told the committee , was a manila envelope about seven inches wide , eleven or twelve inches long and from an inch to an inch and a half thick . Robert E. Stripling , chief committee investigator , showed Mr. Levine one of the cylinders which contained the film and asked whether it was possible that they could have been in this package . Mr. Levine said this was possible . " Are you or have you ever been a member of the Communist party ? " Mr. Stripling asked Mr. Levine . " I am not a Communist and have never been a Communist , " Mr. Levine , answered , apparently somewhat surprised at the question . This has been a stock question in the committee 's investigation . In the background of all of today 's proceedings the battle between the committee and the Justice Department seethed . Committee Position Stated The committee appeared to . a rankled most by the urgent request by the Justice Department that it not summon witnesses who had or might be called before the New York grand jury . The committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Levine hearing . Later , Mr. Mundt said : " It is utterly silly for two coordinating branches of the Government to get involved in a running debate over who is going to talk to a witness . As far as this committee is concerned , there is just one big unsolved question left : " Who stole these ' documents from the State Department which we know were delivered to Mr. Chambers at the time he admits he was a paid Communist agent ? This committee is not going to permit any source to squelch our efforts to answer that question . " We are giving and will continue to give full cooperation to all Government agencies by making avail= able to them all evidence coming into our possession . While we - regret that this reciprocal attitude is apparently not to be a two-way street , we shall continue to try to discover , to disclose and to punish disloyal employes who stole secret documents with the purpose of delivering them to foreign Communist agents . " Representative John E. Rankin , of Mississippi , committee member , commented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tom Clark , the attorney general , we 'd never have got our hands on these documents . " Mr. Clark gave a breezy retort as he left a Cabinet meeting at the White House . " I 'm filing everything in pumpkins so I can locate it , " he said .
