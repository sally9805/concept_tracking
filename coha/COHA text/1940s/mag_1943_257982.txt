Dwindling manpower , machinery and gasoline may force many a U.S. golf club to close its links before summer ends . One middle-aged addict who wants to prevent this is Walter Prichard Eaton , Yale Drama Associate Professor , who has roamed U.S. fairways for nearly 50 years . In this month 's Atlantic Monthly Professor Eaton hazarded a cure : " . . . All we have to do is buy a flock of sheep . They know that already in England . " <P> " Do I hear sniffs of derision ? " he asks . " What . . . if the sheep leave a hoof print to spoil your lie ? What if the greens are too slow or uneven to make perfect putting possible ? What if , in the absence of rough , the man who slices has as good a chance as you ? My answer is that you , Mr. Sniffer , are probably the man who slices and in your heart you 'd be extremely happy to find that you did n't have to lose three strokes three feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually it would n't make enough difference in your score to be detected by a certified public accountant . . . . Nobody 's putting was ever perfect on any green , not even Walter Travis ' , and you are n't Walter Travis . . . . <P> " You are merely one of the great majority who pay the bills and keep up the courses so that the slashing youngsters can boast of playing a 450-yd. hole with a driver and a No. 7 , and so that the pros will give your course their haughty approval , and maybe so that tournaments can be played there in which case you 'll be kept off the links for their duration . <P> " You do n't have as much fun as you used to when holes were shorter , golf was simpler , and you did n't live a subterranean existence in sand traps . And now you 've got to give it all up because there are no men to rake out your footprints , or run the power mowers , or patch the elaborate tees , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines if the men were available . . . . Silly , is n't it ? " <P> It certainly is when a flock of sheep , an ancient shepherd , and a good dog would keep the course going . . . . "
