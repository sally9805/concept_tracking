Britain 's Labor government and British labor were heading for a showdown . For more than two years , the trade unions had grudgingly gone along with the government 's policy of virtually freezing wages &; prices . But when devaluation of the pound thawed out some prices and sent them climbing upwards , the unions ' rank &; file rebelled . Britain 's T.U.C. ( Trades Union Congress ) presented new demands : higher wages , more government subsidies to keep food prices down , additional taxes to cut down business profits . <P> Last week , T.U.C. leaders faced their government 's key men in Sir Stafford Cripps 's study in the House of Commons . Beside Cripps at his maroon-topped desk sat Ernest Bevin and Aneurin Bevan , both good union men . Ernie Bevin assumed the role in which he feels most at home : that of the table-thumping , tough-spoken bargainer . This time he was arguing for the employer 's side , i.e. , the government . When the T.U.C. leaders reiterated their demands , Bevin rumbled that it was up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their government . <P> The T.U.C. leaders ruefully gave in , agreed to a freeze of wage levels for one year . The T.U.C. has no authority to make its decisions binding on its members , but it looked as if most of its unions would stick to the agreement . British labor was still learning the hard lesson that Britain 's Socialist government could be a good deal tougher than the bosses with whom Ernie Bevin bargained in his trade-union days .
