The psychiatrists have offered their services to the world 's politicians . Last week in London the psychiatrists , psychologists and educators attending the International Congress on Mental Health ( TIME , Aug. 23 ) got around to the vexing subject of " world citizenship and group relations . " * Unless war is prevented , Cornell University Psychiatrist Carl Binger told the delegates , " there will not be any world to be citizens in . " <P> There is a reasonable way out , declared Dr. Binger , but he was not sure that enough of the world 's governments are interested in listening to reason ( meaning the scientists ) . Politicians , he said , would not think of trying to wage modern warfare without the help of the scientists . These same scientists , he said , might be able to prevent war if they were only called in before the war began . <P> The congress , hopefully standing ready to do what it could , formed a World Federation for Mental Health . Its ambitious aim : to gain for mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W.F.M.H. will cooperate with such United Nations groups as WHO and UNESCO . Russia was not represented at London , but will be invited to join . <P> <P> * For news of other international meetings , see INTERNATIONAL , RELIGION , SCIENCE .
