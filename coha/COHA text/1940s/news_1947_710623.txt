txt Considering the naLooking tional situation - in regard for a to housing , the advertisHome ing of country homes , big and  --  little , makes interesting reading . With people clamoring for any kind of protection from the weather , it was logical to assume that rural realtors would not bother with many adjectives . One could visualize terse , impersonal , ads that ... baldly stated : " Farm , view , six-room house , barn , $4,500 , terms . " Perhaps that 's enough in the teeming centers . The Puzzled Philosopher , has taken only an academic interest in the situation because , with increased classes , no higher wages , a married daughter , husband and baby living on the third floor of his Eighteen Ninety house , a refrigerator that hands in its resignation at fortnightly intervals , a car that was second-hand in 1935 , a temperamental lawn mower , and window shutters that his alter ego says must positively be painted without delay , he has kept reasonably busy . But the busiest of men Time have time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want time to dream . There are those who look steadily to the advertisements for that I place in the country that some day , they hope , will become a reality . A man can dream , though the air waves are filled with rollicking jingles of hair tonic and stomach soothers , pronouncements on international complications , breakfast parties for elderly tourists , and comedians who can make studio audiences scream , though the humor does n't quite reach across a continent . It does something to a man 's morale to pick up a paper and find in this atomic year of hesitant peace treaties that the nation can carry on . Without adjectives and adverbs something would be lacking . Nouns and verbs may be the skeleton , but it requires raiment to make the picture balance . The rational man is not disturbed over the similar qualifications of so many places . There are those who , have suggested a standard form , except for the variation in acreage . Some dreamers want just a few acres ; others like to think in terms of large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of woodland . There 's the group that Call loves the sea and is lookof the ing for a little place by Sea the seashore . Not for these the rolling fields and lifted hills ; they want the eternal unquiet of ocean 's surface and the tides that wax and wane each twenty-four hours . Therefore , in justice to all dreamers , we need two standard descriptions . For the first group the following is suggested : " Beneath great sheltering rock maples , a cozy six-room Cape Codder nestles against a rock-studded hillside . Bubbling , spring-fed , pebblebottomed brook winds across property at foot of fertile garden spot . Lilac hedge along the road . Strawberries , raspberries , cherries , rhubarb and asparagus waiting for the lucky owner of this farm . Long ell and fascinating woodshed . House built in 1790 ; still has original wrought-iron ' latches and two Dutch ovens . Pump at kitchen sink and electric line only half-mile distant . Roads plowed in winter . House needs some repairs . " For the second group Plus this might ' serve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Repairs " Quaint , old , picturesque , fisherman 's five - room house on hillside above beautiful , historical harbor . Gorgeous view of the ocean . Unspoiled New England seaside village . Relax here where the tensions of modern life are unknown . Find peace in magnificent sunsets and the soothing , rolling , rhythmic tides of the mighty sea . House built in 1765 . Big fireplace in living room . Small compact kitchen . Old-fashioned windows . Electricity available and pump at kitchen sink . House needs some repairs . " Of course , there are those who have found these places . One hears about them and , how much enjoyment there is to be had in weeding gardens , mowing lawns , shingling roofs , painting and papering . On the other hand , it 's just possible that the dreamers who read the advertisements have more time to listen to the ocean and brooks and enjoy the beautiful views . Life without dreams is barren .
