txt Congress dealt the Administration another severe blow today through Senate approval of a bill which would end the Office of Price Administration 's price rollback program for butter and beef and , in the absence of specific legislative authorization , ban future subsidy programs to hold down or roll back prices . The action followed the overriding yesterday of the President 's veto of the Smith-Connally antistrike bill and was similar to the prohibition against subsidies voted yesterday by the House , also in considering the bill to extend the . life of the Commodity Credit Corporation , War Food Administration agency , for two years from July 1 and to increase its borrowing power from $2,650,000 , - 000 to $3,650,000,000 . Most of the food subsidy programs have been carried out by the CCC and Congress made the measure a vehicle for the ' longpending test on subsidy policies . Bill Goes to Conference Although the Senate left little doubt of its views on the OPA attempt to roll back the prices of beef , butter and coffee at an annual estimated cost of $450,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subsidy situation still confused . The Senate bill goes to conference with the House and apparently the parliamentary situation is such that the conferees may radically modify the subsidy policy stated in the measures , but since the House and Senate provisions were much the same , this seemed unlikely . The Senate began consideration of the CCC bill today by approving , 39 to 37 , the amendment by Senator Bennett C. Clark , Democrat , of Missouri to repeal the authority of the OPA to make subsidy payments but permit the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to continue transportation and some other subsidies . It then substituted for the Clark amendment an amendment by Senator George D. Aiken , Republican , of Vermont . The vote on the Aiken amendment was 46 to 29 . Most Administration Democrats voted for it . It is less drastic than the Clark amendment and is along the lines of the House proposal . It had the support of the conservative farm organizations , the Farm Bureau Federation , the National Grange , the Milk Producers Federation and the National Co-op Council . Interpreted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would eliminate immediately upon enactment the rollback on butter and beef and a $15,000,000 CCC program under which cheese is purchased and sold at a loss to ? hold down prices , but would make good the Government 's promise to pay subsidies on butter and meat from June 1 , 1943 , until the amendment becomes law . It would permit the continuation of subsidy programs on the canning crops ( tomatoes , corn , peas and beans ) , and subsidies on field beans and peas , as well as proigrams on hemp and sugar , as well as permit the continuation of the CCC price support program on peanuts , flaxseed , cottonseed and soybeans . It would also permit the con , tinued subsidized sale of wheat for feed , and Senator Aiken declared that it would provide a third and new price standard for maximum price ceilings on agricultural commodities , " namely , the support price announced for an agricultural commodity by the Department of Agriculture . " The amendment stipulates that the prohibition against subsidies not apply to those for which the government was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and livestock . The question arose whether the amendment applied to the proposed rollback in coffee prices . Apparently this depended upon whether the OPA had legally committed itself to the coffee program and the answer to this seemed in doubt . After passage of the Aiken amendment , Senator Joseph C. O'Mahoney , Democrat of Wyoming , introduced an amendment to turn over subsidy powers with regard to food to the War Food Administrator , Chester C. Davis . After a brief explanation of his proposal , the Senate adopted it by a standing vote and then passed the bill with a chorus of " ayes . " OP.A. officials said tonight that they intended to go ahead with their roll-back program pending developments on the legislation . They reported that the retail price of beef had been rolled back three cents a pound by the program and the price of butter five to six cents . The President has several times strongly advocated the use of food subsidies to keen down the cost of living . If the Senate and House agree on a bill along the lines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on food has strong backing in the ranks of organized labor and Philip Murray , president of the CIO , and other labor officials have served notice that they will renew demands for wage increases if the roll-back is stopped .
