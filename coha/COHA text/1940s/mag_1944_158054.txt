Janie ( Warner ) , according to the studio handouts , " is today 's 16-year-old ; vibrant , clear-eyed , frank and astonishingly well-poised . " Since adolescent poise still astonishes millions of people and adolescent vibrations still roll most adults in the aisles , it is a safe bet that Janie will clean up as tidily at cinema box offices as it did on Broadway ( TIME , Sept. 21 , 1942 ) . <P> At the start Janie ( Joyce Reynolds ) likes to doubletalk and to schmooze with drab civilian " Scooper " Nolan ( Dick Erdman ) at blanket parties . Then the Army arrives , to use Janie 's home town as a base for maneuvers , and Janie puts away childish things . Thereafter Private Dick Lawrence ( Robert Hutton ) maneuvers exclusively with her . <P> Janie 's father ( Edward Arnold ) , who publishes the town paper , writes a blast about youth 's pitfalls , but while his wife ( Ann Harding ) and his best friend ( Robert Benchley ) demur , the mote in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night when the family is out , arranges to vibrate with Pvt . Lawrence in the privacy of her home . Thanks to Scooper , who is mad with jealousy , and to her little sister Elspeth ( Clare Foley ) who combines the less endearing features of a stool pigeon , a blackmailer and the Marquis de Sade , they get no privacy . By the time Janie 's parents get home , along with the town police and a batch of MPs , there is precious little home to get to . Janie promptly sweetens everybody 's temper with a strong plea for letting youth , inexperience and lonely soldiers do as much for every U.S. home . <P> The Canterville Ghost ( M.G.M. ) is a tub of ectoplasm ( Charles Laughton ) whose cowardice , in a bygone century , caused his brave old father to wall him up in the family castle . The unhappy ghost was doomed to walk the night until some male Canterville should give a good account of himself in battle . But throughout Britain 's embattled history , Cantervilles left only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canterville birthmark was discovered on the neck of a U.S. soldier ( Robert Young ) billeted at Canterville Castle . When the ghost and little Lady Jessica ( Margaret O'Brien ) told him that his heroism must lay the Canterville ghost , G.I. Young was scared to death . But in the long run he proved himself a red-blooded American . <P> Fantasy , like realism , pays off only when it is created with fingers instead of thumbs . The best of this film is Laughton 's broad hamming of the hammy ghost and some friendly moments between Miss O'Brien and Mr. Young . But not all the comedy is ghostly . One of the picture 's funniest scenes shows G.I.s , abashed by M.G.M. 's conception of aristocratic England , trying to be graceful with their teacups.
