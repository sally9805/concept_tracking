Jeffers for President ? <P> Sirs : <P> I hope the Republicans have enough political acumen . . . not to overlook the name of Bill Jeffers when they consider suitable candidates for the Presidency . <P> Here is a man who did an outstanding job in the political maelstrom of Washington ; a man who has worked up from the bottom to the successful head of one of our largest enterprises-the Union Pacific Railroad ; a man who knows what it means to " make a dollar . " . . . Surely such a one on the record of his past performances should appeal not only to Labor and Management , but to the great bulk of the American public . And as a fighting man he should have a great appeal to our armed forces . . . . <P> M. LOWRY ALLEN , M.D. Salt Lake City <P> &gt; Nominations , both Republican and Democratic , are still open. - ED . <P> A Part of the Battle <P> Sirs : <P> I am writing in reference to ... the opinions of TIME readers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sept. 27 ) . To my dismay and concern , I have heard too often echoed among my own acquaintances the opinions of such readers . . . . <P> To leave " planning of the future world in what we trust are capable civilians hands " is , for the serviceman , or anyone else , unjustified escapism . While reading a " nice comfy article " on what we are fighting for may not be the favorite recreation of the war-weary soldier , thinking along such lines is just as much a part of the battle as taking " Hill ' X. ' " <P> For a soldier to divorce himself from the ideals for which he is fighting and become simply a destructive machine may be a paragon of military discipline , but it is not the attitude which will help construct a world in which such conflicts as the present one may be avoided . . . . <P> ( Pvt . ) JOHN M. BAILEY JR . Camp Fannin , Tex . <P> Ring Form in Washington <P> Sirs : <P> On the cover page of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Speaker Sam Rayburn of the national House of Representatives , it would appear that the White House holds its guard with its left hand up while the nation 's Capitol is guilty of unorthodox ring form . When the writer was receiving his primary ring instructions and being coached in the technique of ring strategy , it was a must always to lead with the left . <P> Is the public generally to understand that the Capitol is the less well coached in ring technique than the White Rouse , or that either opponent is a less formidable adversary ? . . . <P> CHARLES CLIFTON PETERS JR . Washington <P> &gt; Coaching aside , the Capitol is a good bet to lead with its right rather than its left. - ED . <P> Best Beef Breeds Sirs : In the Oct. 4 issue , story of sale at Oldfields Farm , you say the Aberdeen-Angus is now the U.S. 's best beef breed .
