To answer some of the questions our subscribers have been asking about how TIME gathers , verifies , writes and distributes its news . <P> TIME 'S Miscellany editor claims his department is the only one which has gone completely unchanged through all the twenty years since TIME be gan . <P> We did n't even have a Letters column in our earliest issues ( it was launched in December 1924 ) . The first Current Affairs Test came in 1935-appeared twice a year after that until this January , when the government 's paper cut order forced us to leave it out . We started Radio in 1938 , Army &; Navy in 1940 . <P> But TIME has discarded as well as added a good many departments in its twenty years-:some of them because they just did n't turn out to be important enough , some ( like World Fairs ) when the jobs they were created for were done . There was a Crime department in our first issue which soon became a part of National Affairs ( now U.S. at War ) -a Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finance in 1929 ) -a department of Aeronautics , which was renamed Transport in 1934 and later added to Business &; Finance too . <P> We also had a department in which we Pointed With Pride ( to " the annual taxes of $90 per capita which Britons bear without grumbling " ) - another in which we Viewed With Alarm ( the " taller Japanese to be evolved by straphanging in Tokyo 's new subway " ) - and still another called Imaginary Interviews in which the newsmakers of the past week " explained " why their names had made the headlines . <P> In the beginning we had a policy of ending many of our stories with a final paragraph headed " Significance , " but we gave that up about 15 years ago-partly because it was too mechanical , partly because it did seem that all our stories should be written so their significance would be clear long before the last paragraph . <P> Off and on during the Twenties we listed important arrivals and leave-takings in a column called Coming &; Going-for several years we had a department devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we gave Fashions in clothes and kitchenware and conduct a department all their own . <P> Perhaps the greatest change in TIME over the past twenty years has been a gradual one , however : the quiet and steady expansion of every department in an effort to make each one so authoritative in its field that it can stand inspection under the expert 's microscope . <P> And today all sorts of specialists seem to be following TIME 's reporting of their field . In Washington , for example , more key officials read TIME than any other magazine , no matter how big its circulation ; newspaper editors rank TIME their favorite magazine ; a TIME story in Science once gave a clue to the nature of the X-particle ; in the American Medical Association Journal TIME is one of the only two lay journals which have been indexed among medical publications . <P> TIME 's General Manager is fond of saying that magazines are like people : they are born and they die , and those live longest which most readily adapt themselves to their times . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world it has reported for twenty years-and twenty years from now I will be very much surprised if our table of contents is not quite different .
