Last week answers were given to five Administration spokesmen-Secretaries Hull , Morgenthau , Stimson , Knox and OPM Director General Knudsen-who fortnight ago said on behalf of the Lend-Lease Bill that the U. S. was in imminent danger if Britain fell ( TIME , Jan. 27 ) . Summoned by Republican minority members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , opponents who did not believe that the U. S. would be greatly endangered if Britain fell paraded in &; out of a jampacked committee room , thumping desks , shaking heads , pointing fingers , answering one overstated case with equal overstatements . The committee was prepared to report the bill out . but first it had to hear : <P> &gt; Joseph Patrick Kennedy , who smilingly took the stand , and filling the room with obfuscation , could not even make up his mind whether he should be called " Mister " or " Ambassador . " Said Mr. Kennedy cheerfully : " Whichever way you want me is all right with me . " It was the nearest he got to defining his position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empower the President to get the job done , but Congress should not surrender all its control . <P> &gt; Colonel Charles Augustus Lindbergh , who was as positive as Mr. Kennedy was evasive . With little to say about the Lend-Lease Bill outside of flatly opposing it , he had much to say about peace and isolation . He saw little danger of a successful invasion of the U. S. , if the country were protected by 10,000 modern planes in service , with another 10,000 replacements and trainer planes in reserve . The Colonel believed that the Western Hemisphere could be economically independent . As for his sympathies : " I prefer to see neither side win . I prefer a negotiated peace . " On aid to Britain : " Our aid is not going to be sufficient and I believe we have encouraged a war in Europe that is not going to be successful . " <P> &gt; General Hugh Johnson , looking like a tough sirloin , who pounded the table and belligerently told the committee that it could read what he thought in his columns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given all the powers that H.R. 1776 gave the President . He was for aid to Britain but he was loudly opposed to " humanitarian lollipopping all over the world . " <P> &gt; Norman Thomas , whose right to speak for all U. S. Socialists was challenged by some of his colleagues . Politely bitter , he admitted that he preferred a British victory to a Nazi one , but bespoke his distrust of an " imperialist " Churchill . His objection to H.R. 1776 coincided with Hugh Johnson 's : it gave too much power to the President . <P> &gt; William R. Castle , Under Secretary of State under President Hoover , who agreed with Colonel Lindbergh that the U. S. <P> was in no danger of invasion , even if the British Fleet should be destroyed or captured . The bill , said Mr. Castle , gave the President too much power over the U. S. and Britain too . " through his control of the supplies flowing out from what he pleases to call ' the arsenal of democracy . ' " Other objectors joined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards were handy .
