txt A universal plaint of employers here is : " Where are the women 7 " Firms are plagued by the worst womanpower shortage in their memory . Typical of the difficulties being encountered is a recent experience of one private employment agency : " We ran a 32 line ad in the two largest San Francisco papers the other day , offering jobs with salaries from $160 to $400 a month . We got only one response  --  and she asked about the $400 job , of Course . " The personnel manager of a large firm told another employment agent , " Girls used to come in and spend the first 15 minutes talking up their character and skill Now they breeze in and ask two questions : . How many hours a week ? How much money do you pay ? " Several agents agreed on one reason for the shortage . Veterans shy away from confining desk jobs after several years of life in the open , and women are needed as replaceIments . Take this example : " In insurance , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cancellation and indorsement jobs . Today men do n't want this indoor xork . They do n't want to start at anything less than underwriters . So these jobs go to women . And there are n't enough women to go around . " Men Avoid Large Concerns , Another agent says : " Men today are in ? dined to steer.clear of large institutions such as banks . insurance companies and oil companies . The reasons they give are the low starting pay and the feeling that there 's not much chance for advancement in big , imper'sonal firms of this type . So we have to find women to take their place . " One agency lists five reasons for the womenpower shortage : ( 1 ) the lean crop of trained office help , a result of the wartime drift of women from commercial to war factory work ; ( 2 ) the return of married women to housewife duties , now that their husbands are home ; ( 3 ) the large number of women employed in swollen government agencies ; ( 4 ) the housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town girls to the cities ; and ( 5 ) the heavier demand for office help created by new firms , increased business of old firms , and the shorter work week . Salaries have climbed as employers bid , against the shortage . The average offering price for a good stenographer Is now $175 a month ; for a good secretary , $200 a month . Girls are asking for $200 to $225 for these jobs . Say the girls , " they want us to look neat and that means good clothes , trips to the hair dresser , manicures and all sorts of little things that we simply ca n't do on less than $200 a month . " The employers reply , " Before the war we paid these girls $75 a month . The coat of living has n't gone up that much . " Household Workers Hard To Get Domestic help is almost as hard to get as It was during the war . An agency reports that few people are willing to take housework on a monthly basis , although wages run from $150 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooks , plus room and board . " Most houseworkers operate on an hourly basis of $1 an hour plus carfare . They usually work a minimum of 25 hours a week , " an agency said . One fact emerges from a survey of employment agencies : The difference in attitude toward work between men and women . " Men seek security , " said one agency . " They ask themselves , where will I be five years , from now ? They are much more choosey than women . " The main concern of women , on the other hand , is money , agencies report .. " Work is a secondary concern of women ; marriage is primary , one agency saki .
