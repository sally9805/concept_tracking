SAN FRANCISCO If nMHE thing about San Francisco is not so much what it is as what it does to you . In the first place , it 's in California , which to many Ameri-cans is a dynamic and intoxicating circumstance , else why the great and continuing hegira to this fastest-growing state ? Secondly , it is a seaport , and any busy seaport , with its ships and foreign flags , its kaleidoscopic smells and dripping ropes , enlivens the imagination and laces it with fancy . Then , whether a city he Boston or Bagdad , its traditions and the character of its past have a way of seeping into you , accenting your moods and tinting their flavor . And if you find yourself in a place whose past has often been detonated with fires and gold rushes , vice and tong wars , if the sky is strung with bridges on which a man has much the feeling of a flea crossing the base of a concert harp , if the downtown street corners are ablaze with hloasoms , if the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then , the very earth itself hauls offend does the jelly roll , then , friend , you 're in San Francisco , the city where anything can happen , and most things already have . San Francisco has the feeling of a Graustark devised by Bret Harte , Mark Twain , Jack London and Robert Louis Stevenson , plus a couple of dashes of Saroyan  --  all of whose imaginations are woven into the emotional fabric of the town . As a result of some kind of necromantic contagion , you find that , unlike the novitiate Los Angeleno who dons a purple shirt and cuts his britches off at the thighs to show that he has broken loose from the conventionality of his Eastern or Midwestern birthplace , you yourself , in your San Francisco incarnation , undergo a change that is entirely subjective . Your point of view becomes that of a cloak-andsword character who , happily conscious of the deceit , masquerades in plain clothes . Clothes , by the way , from which the fog , just in passing , has quietly melted away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enshrouding the town in mystery and moist but exciting romance . It 's as fine a place to sit around and talk as Vienna was in the good days . It 's civilized and robust , and its shoulder wo n't fit a chip . When you PHOTOGRAPHY BY GENE LESTER point out something wrong with the place , its people relish that defect , too  --  because it 's a valid part of San Francisco . Unlike most American cities , much of San Francisco 's growth has been reluctant . Profoundly convinced that it is the best town in America , it does n't get worked up about trying to be the biggest . As a matter of principle , it judiciously resists mere change for change 's sake , and seldom confuses commotion with progress . In normal times San Francisco has a much easier gait than its hyperthyroid sister to the south . Perhaps it 's natural that a financial center whose Montgomery Street is called " the Wall Street of the West " should be in some ways more conservative . Not that Mr. Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inboard side of the Bay , is wanting in showmanship . Or , for that matter , A. P. Giannini , head of the Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association . And even though more conservative San Francisco financiers look down their noses at the ballyhoo Mr. Giannini has introduced into banking , he was , nevertheless , in a position  --  for a few months  --  to claim that his Bank of America was the biggest on earth . Yet the accomplishments of these men are hardly a match for the aspirations of thirty-seven-year-old Paul C. Smith , general manager of San Francisco 's only home-owned newspaper , the Chronicle . ( Continued on Page 56 ) ( Continued front Page 54 ) Captain Evans stuck the brandy bottle into the steward 's hands , choked , You feed it to him , " and fled . He felt as if he would blow a valve if he had to listen to any more . Eight days later , when they were limping into port , Mr. Fergie entered t he captain 's cabin and sat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " he rasped . " And t hey say miracles do n't happen . " " Just a minute , " protested the captain , waving his hand . He was studying a paper on his blotter , and , after chewing his pen a moment , wrote another line , Then he leaned back and sighed . " Well , that 's that , " he declared . Mr. Fergie bit on his pipestem and looked blank . " That 's what , sir ? " " Just a list , " Captain Evans explained " I want you to take it ashore and get it filled . It 's a list of books I think I 'd better read again . " Mr. Fergie was still for a Iong moment , and then he reached into his pocket . " Funny thing , " he said wryly . " I just made out one myself . If you 'll give me yours , sir , I 'll send them both ashore with Mr. Johnson . Being an expert , he 'll probably be able to cross out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the captain agreed . " He probably will . Er  --  what is be doing now ? " Mr. Fergie coughed . " He 's on the bridge , sir , talking to the pilot . Explaining , so far as I got it , some fine points of pilotage law as contained in Stewart 's Pilotage and its Problems . I  --  er  --  think , sir , we 'd maybe better go up and atop it before the pilot jumps overboard ! " THE END SAN FRANCISCO ( Ca. r ialr  --  d from Page 24 ) Just out of uniform and back at his desk , he 's all set to get a dam built across the Bay , so that the San Pablo end will become a body of fresh water available for industrial uses . He also talks of building the dominant newspaper in the whole West , and of perhaps eventually giving Seattle ten-minute delivery service via radio controlled rocket .. But he says that his over-all ambition is to raise the per capita income of the people living in the Pacific basin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , is still in the laugh stage . But he was n't laughing when he told it to me . He has settled West Coast strikes when nobody else could , and has been petitioned by 48,000 San Franciscans to run for mayor . But at the moment them is the little matter of trying to whittle down the 100,000 circulation lead held by Mr. Hearst 's Examiner , which , by the way , was the first paper he ever owned . The Examiner people somewhat condescendingly say , " We try to help the Chronicle . We 're afraid that if they folded , some tough competition might come to town . " The competition between the afternoon News and Call-Bulletin is another cat-fight altogether . At present , San Francisco is experiencing some important sociological and economic changes . ( 1 ) It is emerging more and more from the dominant influence of its old families such as the Crockers , Phelans , Sutros , Fleishhackera , and Dollars , the last being a name which long packed a wallop in every Pacific port . ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over from a **30;2522;TOOLONG economy into one where industry is of equal prominence . But its favorite period is still the roaring 80 's , and sentimental San Francisco warmly treasures and savors the traditions and physical oddments of the past . It was angry when the bridges put most of the ferry boats out of business . It loves to gaze upon the late-Cleveland , early-McKinley architecture in which the town still abounds . Many San Franciscans would feel seriously out of the swim if they did not know Sally Stanford , often mentioned by the press as " the town 's most distinguished madam , " who holds forth in what is widely and erroneously believed to be the " Anna Held house , " milk bath and all , which is a cozy meeting place for politicians and the fellows who come off the late shifts of the newspapers . At heart  --  and it is demonstrated in a thousand pleasant ways  --  San Francisco is still gas-lit . One of the busiest and best-loved relics of its gas-lit days is the little cable cars , often almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll up and down her steep hills . When you see the faces of the people riding the cable cars , you understand why San Franciscans love them so much . For as people mount these little fugitives from a Gay Nineties carnival , there comes over their faces a sheepish expression of not-wholly-hidden delight , and they no longer look upon their fellow man , hanging precariously on the step , as a recalcitrant lout , but as somehow silly and lovable . Pedestrians turn and fondly smile as the crowded little cars bump past with belle busily aclang ; it 's hard for some onlookers to keep themselves from walking right out into the street and patting the merry little vehicles . . If you got acquainted with the passengers on these cars , you 'd find that almost every nationality was represented . More than a score of these foreign-born groups still celebrate their national feast days with dancing and banquets , speeches and parades . The largest groups are Italians , Germans , Irish , and the inhabitants of San Francisco 's Chinatown  --  the largest this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chamber of Commerce , and so on . Since San Francisco is small in area , it would he difficult for any of these groups completely to avoid daily contact with the others . The result is a sort of pint-sized " One World , " an accidental but actual uniting of nations . And it was logical that this city of letters , of cultural and cosmopolitan influences , where the Opera House is just as municipally owned as the jail , should have been chosen as the scene of the first United Nations conference . Those delegates who arrived by plane had simply to look out of the window to see that San Francisco , built on the tip of a peninsula , was an imposing regional capital , closely surrounded by scores of satellite towns and cities . But they 'd also guess that Oakland , with its heavy industries and its 500,000 people , was of a size ? and consequence that made it more a full-dress rival than a mere auxiliary city . After all , those delegates who arrived by train had it demonstrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangements have to be made to go on across the Bay and reach the City of the Golden Gate . And delegates who were familiar with the local scene knew you can no more win friends in Oakland by referring to it as the Brooklyn of the West , than you can by calling its big neighbor Frisco . Many a delegate , having taken a quick brush-up on San Francisco 's past , knew that even though the Bay was first discovered as far back as 1769 , nothing much happened until 1848 , when California 's gold was accidentally discovered . Within two years ' time , California had been admitted into the Union , and San Francisco , this tag end of nowhere , had leaped from a population of 860 into a city of more than 30,000 people , with scores of thousands of others on the way . The harbor was lined with abandoned ships whose crews had gone off to the gold fields . The mud streets were " not passable or even jackassable . " Eggs brought up to fifty dollars a dozen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $40,000 . Some of those who struck it rich bad all their teeth pulled out and gold ones put in . Down-andouters were able to live on the gold dust they sifted from gambling house sweepings . Murderers , fancy ladies and thieves flooded into town . The orgies of Pompeii were all present  --  with improvements . Girls could be rented or bought outright , and the town was burned six times , usually by thugs for the purpose of looting . To establish some vestige of order , a Vigilance Committee was formed , and its point of view generally was , " Let 's give him a fair trial and hang him . " San Franciscans began to import through their great harbor the finest of the world 's goods and pleasures . They demanded , and were able to pay for , the world 's best talent in chanteuse or chef . Opulent living became an ingrained San Francisco habit . But the Civil War diverted the Boston clippers , the sea-going department stores which had supplied San Francisco with clocks and shoes and muslin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast , and Collis P. Huntington , " a hard and cheery old man , " according to Arthur McEwen , " with no more soul than a shark , " along with Mark Hopkins , Charles Crocker and Leland Stanford , pitched in and built the Central Pacific . It was a monopoly , and nature took its course . San Francisco was furious . The railroad mercilessly gouged the whole region on its freight rates , and laid an iron hand on state politics . Ultimately , competitive rail linesreached San Francisco , and its pain was eased . But even at the turn of the century the Bay area was still largely dependent upon the outside world for manufactured products , and traded its cereals , fruit , wool , timber and wine to get them . In 1906 the heaving earth shook the terrified town to pieces , and the ensuing fire consumed the rubble . But it was built back into place long before the great event of 1920 . That year the Panama Canal was officially opened , and San Francisco moved thousands of miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern immigrants remained strong and steady , continuously bulging and bolstering San Francisco 's local markets and real-estate prices . She acquired cheap hydroelectric power and , even though most of it was nearer Los Angeles , struck oil . By Pearl Harbor time , the Bay area was an , important part of American industry , was making some steel and building ships , refining such quantities of petroleum that the bass out of the ( Continued on Page 58 ) 58 THE SATURDAY ( Cuntinard fruan Page .56 ) lower Sacramento River had long since come to have the flavor of used crankcase oil . It was fabricating important quantities of wood and paper , and , drawing upon the fabulous agricultural resources of the 400-mile-long Great Central Valley , was a huge factor in processing America 's food . It is a great coffee-importing center , and one of its best and largest smells is that of the roasting beans . One of San Francisco 's steadiest sources of income is that old ever-loving tourist dollar . San Francisco has long been the secret libido of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's ability to serve up sin , well decorated . The Barbary Coast , which in the old days was a huge attraction to out-of-town " alummers , " is now something less than a reasonable facsimile of its former iniquitous glory . Its noisiest block of night spots , called the International Settlement , is garish and briskly crummy , wanting in the rubicund dignity of the parlor houses of the old Barbary Coast . But Curt Clark , veteran San Francisco crime reporter , who has just bought into Gene 's Club , earnestly declares there 's not a clip joint in the block . In seeing San Francisco 's sights in the months from October to April , it 's well to have a sturdy raincoat . San Francisco has no great extremes of temperature . It 's usually nice and cool , but just as the summers are predictably dry , its winters are soaking wet . Also , for reasons later to be given , it 's a good idea , in this city of short downtown distances , to walk whenever possible .

This lounge , like many an important San Francisco structure , was designed by Architect and Bon Vivant Timothy Pflueger , whose guest , Diego Rivera , was once ejected for wearing no necktie . On a clear day a trip across either of San Francisco 's great bridges  --  the Golden Gate Bridge , the world 's longest and highest single-span suspension bridge , or the **28;2554;TOOLONG San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge  --  presents an inspiring and exciting spectacle . Part of the way across the Bay Bridge you can see Treasure Island , now a Navy base , where San Francisco held its Golden Gate International Exposition . Leland Cutler , insurance executive and San Francisco addict , who was president of the exposition organization , laconically points out that the reason its backers did not get back the $6,500,000 they kittied in was that " the United States was tired of World 's Fairs , and San Francisco and New York just did n't know it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads much of its cultural life , San Francisco has a couple of legitimate theaters and an enthusiastic hacker in Louis R.

Many San Franciscan bibliophiles are rampant collectors of any item bearing the imprint of San Francisco 's Grabhorn Press . The beauty and excellence of its hand-set and hand-bound books are said by experts to be unsurpassed in all the world . But since all its editions are limited , it has never published San Francisco 's personally EVENING POST best-loved author , Gertrude Atherton , of Black Oxen fame . She is still jaunty at eighty-eight , a reluctantly admitted great-great-grandmother , and is now busily writing another book .

A key figure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs Liebes creates fabrics not only for Eastern designers but for technicolor sets and the decor of ships , air lines and hotels , as well as " the master copies " from which hundreds of thousands of Eastern mill workers make machine-woven textiles .

And the same goes for Don Budge and that famed trio of distaff racquet-teers , Helen Wills , Helen Jacobs and Alice Marble . As any sports fan knows , San Francisco is the scene of the yearly East-West football classic , and the place where the Di Maggio boys got their start .

There are many fine restaurants in the foreign sections , and wooden-legged Trader Vic 's , though located in Oakland , is the Colony Club , with a Polynesian accent , for the whole Bay area . George Mardikian , of Omar Khayyam 's , is probably the restaurateur best known to out-of-towners . But ex-Sgt . Georges Reymond , now executive chef of the St. Francis , must certainly be the only chef in town that ever had an Air Force general offer to forgo an additional star if he could keep Georges in charge of his mess .

And though the Pacific Union Club remains exclusively in town , the outdoor-loving San Franciscans who belong to the Family Club have their own club farm for summer outings , and members of the Bohemian Club estivate in their 3000-acre redwood grove . At its clubhouse in town , the Bohemian Club 's Cartoon Room , where the writing Norrises spent many a pleasant February 16 , 19,16 hour , is one of the most delightful clubrooms in the nation , but , in summer , Bohemians are only too glad to escape from the fantastic crush of the city . San Francisco is probably the most suffocatingly jam-packed of all of America 's unanimously overcrowded cities . As a debarkation point for Pacific veterans , San Francisco is now in much the same position as was New York in relation to those coming from Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York 's facilities for housing , feeding and entertaining them . Beyond that , San Francisco 's own population has jumped from 685 , - 000 in 1943 to 825,000 in its most recent count . The number of residents in the metropolitan Bay area increased from 1,700,000 in 1940 to about 2,400,000 in ' 44 . For the last few years San Francisco 's housing occupancy rate has been well in excess of 100 per cent , which means desperation , and hotel lobbies packed with dejected people who overflow the chairs and sit in hopeless rows on the floor . Dan London , who manages the 1000-room St. Francis , San Francisco 's largest and one of its best hotels , says he turns away from 3000 to 7000 room seekers each week . A group of local contractors , the Mayfair Building Corporation , is putting $40,000,000 into apartments . Mr. Henry Kaiser says he 's going to build 10,000 bongos in California at once . If the San Francisco area got them all , it might ease up its housing problem appreciably , but the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two jumps and a gasp this side of complete paralysis . Traffic and housing are the most pressing of a number of Mayor Roger Lapham 's problems . Mayor Lapham , who is built like a bear and geared like a bull , first came into prominence during the water-front strike of the 30 's . Lapham , himself chairman of the board of American-Hawaiian Steamship Lines , agreed to meet Harry Bridges in open debate . The crowd , violently pro-labor , came to boo Lapham , found that it could n't , and liked him . He ran for mayor on a one-term basis and keeps a gadget on his desk that says " days gone " and " days to go . " To meet his traffic problem , he has already consolidated the street-railway system and is hastening studies on a subway that will be designed to funnel much of main-stem Market Street 's traffic load underground , just as a substantial part of the city 's parking problem was buried under Union Square . Beneath this block-square green can be stored , on four subterranean levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commuters increase San Francisco 's daytime population by 20 per cent , even San Francisco 's great and beautiful new bridges are swamped with traffic . Some idea of their traffic burden is suggested by the fact that , while the original financing plan of the Bay Bridge called for a sixty-five-cent toll , it has been possible to drop the toll to a quarter , and the bonds on this $77,000,000 bridge are still being amortized ahead of schedule and will be paid out in seven years . But San Francisco has more luck paying off bridge bonds than suppressing crime . During the 30 's , the vice situation in San Francisco was splendidly stabilized by the police , to whom , it was charged , a considerable portion of the proceeds accrued . They allowed no muscling in by outside thugs . Big-time racketeers from other areas were ( Continued on Page 60 ) 60 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST February 16 , 1916 ( Cortfirati  --  d Jr l'agv 551 met at the Ferry Building on arrival and given their walking papers . In 1937 , the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His report charged that the police department was actually being run by a bail-bond company , that the annual pay-off to the police was around $1,000,000 , that a number of police captains were millionaires , and that lieutenants had amassed private fortunes of hundreds of thousands of dollars . Atherton 's purpose was not to clean up the town , which did n't want to be cleaned up , but merely to try to put the police department back in the hands of the people and the more mischievous members of the force into San Quentin or , if Federal charges were involved , perhaps in Alcatraz . This was the cue for one of San Francisco 's most colorful characters to go into action : sleek , able Jake ( The Master ) Ehrlich , star attorney for San Francisco 's big-time underworld characters . The first case involved a policeman who , it was charged , had actually been seen receiving cash from underworld persons and whose personal fortune , it was claimed , was hardly commensurate with that of a humble and upright copper . Nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Jake in a less suave and sinister way , would have to hump himself to equal , Jake cleared his man , as he did so many other of the apparently unjustly accused policemen . Ehrlich is a periodic target of San Francisco newspapermen , who , when annoyed with him , purposely misspell his name , and have managed to do it as many as twenty times in one story . The underworld and veteran police reporters say that San Francisco is getting ready to open up again , now that it is being debarrassed of the somewhat stifling attitude of the military . San Francisco 's battered old police department got its most recent going-over at the hands of Navy personnel , abetted by a few of the more fearless civilians , in Sar Francisco 's olive-branch observances on V-J Day . Where most of the rest of America 's cities managed to shut off their liquor supply during this period of potential overenthusiasm , San Francisco seldom did . And even after two days of rioting , when every hospital was bulging with injured celebrants and Market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughfare , there was still no co-ordinated action by the civil and military police . On the third night , the Chronicle 's Pulitzer-Prize-winning Stanton Delaplane stood in the midst of this barbaric orgy and wrote : " A looting , smashing crowd is tearing up Market Street tonight . Windows are crashing from Sixth to Third Street . The police and Shore Patrol are unable and not trying to stop it . Most of the mob is made up of sailors . . . . A good fourth of them are staggering drunk . My hands have blood on them and I do n't know where it came from . . . . Four sailors kicked out the window of a leather-goods shop at Fifth and Market and threw the contents into the crowd . Three sailors grabbed a girl and held her while another , staggering with liquor , stripped off her shorts . They ran away into the crowd waving them in the air . . . . One of our truck drivers saw a girl being held down and raped by a small crowd of sailors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes ago three sailors grabbed two passing girls and pulled them up a Fifth Street alley . . . " At eleven o'clock that third night , civilian and military police began joint operations . They formed a solid phalanx of men and vehicles with loudspeakers reading the riot act , moving slowly and inexorably down Market Street . In a short time the street was cleared and the celebration , except for one last occurrence , was over . The period was affixed to the sentence when a grand jury met and not only whitewashed all concerned  --  police , liquor commission and Navy  --  but congratulated them . With tasteful restraint , it did not congratulate the owners of thousands of dollars ' worth of destroyed property , the 1000-plus hospital cases , the scores of understandably unreported rape victims and the more than a dozen dead . However inadequate may be San Francisco 's facilities for riot prevention , it is better prepared than at any other time in its history for the recurrence of earthquakes . Great numbers of its new structures incorporate " earthquake-proof " construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the Bay , once the regular system has been rattled to pieces . Its earthquake insurance rates are steadily declining . A recent policy for $1,500,000 , with a $50,000-deductible clause , covering certain properties of Stanford University out in Hoover-town , carries a $13,000-a-year premium . Six months ago , San Franciscans were deeply disturbed at the prospect of postwar unemployment . At the Bank of America , where every third Californian is a depositor , officials anxiously watched deposits as war contracts were canceled . Prior to that time , deposits throughout the state had been increasing at the rate of about $1,000,000 a day . When the war workers began to be laid off , these deposits not only failed to decline but the amount of increase doubled , and stayed there for sixty days before leveling off again to the original rate of increase . And a good many people in the Bay area now say they just do n't see how any great number of its people can remain idle if it is to build itself an adequate place to live , and establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laundered  --  short of doing as the more fastidious did in the old , virtually womanless gold-rush days , when they sent their laundry to Hawaii and China , even though three months ' service was fast indeed . Though the Bay area will almost certainly continue its fabulous growth , San Francisco , surrounded by water on three sides and on the other by small towns jealous of their sovereignty , has about run out of land , and has pretty well reached the point where , to build something new , something old has to be torn down . Even so , the Bank of America is planning to run up a little skyscraper , and there is also in the offing a new apparel center , to be built in the Potrero district , that will cover twenty-five acres and in which San Francisco 's entire apparel industry  --  showrooms , design studios and factories  --  will be housed in cottage-type buildings , none exceeding four stories in height . The fresh-produce industry is plunking down $5,000,000 for an integrated commission district . Another project is the $25,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since Hawaii 's relationship with San Francisco is more or less like that of Alaska to Seattle . The city is also spending $20,000,000 to make its municipal airport the best in the country , excepting only New York 's Idlewild . But since space limitations prevent San Francisco proper from aspiring to become a city of much more than 1,000,000 people , it 's concerned more with quality than quantity . In the past , it has liked to think of itself as easygoing and fatalistic . It has long since had a great measure of tolerance thrust upon it . It has experienced more in the way both of exaltation and of terror than most of its American sister cities . There are many points from which San Francisco is vulnerable to attack . There are even more reasons for loving San Francisco and being seduced by it . And it seems likely that the very sound of its name will , for a long , long time , continue to cause an automatic quickening of interest , tinged with excitement , in the national consciousness .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
