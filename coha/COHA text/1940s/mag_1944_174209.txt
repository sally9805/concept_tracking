For one day Columbus , Ohio was the football capital of the U.S. At stake was the Big Nine championship and , just possibly , a California Rose Bowl trip . <P> Taking first things first , Ohio State 's homegrown , all-civilian , unbeaten team crashed head-on into once-beaten Michigan . With backfield strength about equal , this was one more gridiron battle that was decided up front . The Michigan line hit hard , but not quite so hard as Ohio 's , led by 190-lb . Bill Hackett , prospective All-America guard , and Bill Willis , husky Negro tackle . Their bone-crushing tackles were mainly responsible for four Michigan fumbles . <P> The 71,958 fans largely overlooked the line battle for the more spectacular antics of Les Horvath , 165-lb . Buckeye backfield wonder . Horvath , who turned down $6,000 a season with the Cleveland ( pro ) Rams in order to finish his Ohio State dental course , is the Big Nine 's top ground-gainer with 669 yards . With his mates paving the way in a seesaw battle , he twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touchdowns . Final score : Ohio State 18 , Michigan 14 . <P> That done , Ohio State began its final push ( with support from Iowa , Purdue , Northwestern ) in a campaign to crack the Big Nine rule against postseason games . This week , Conference representatives meeting in Chicago said no , this was not the year to break the 24-year-old rule . The Big Nine champs would stay home on New Year 's Day , and unbeaten , once-tied Tennessee would doubtless make the trip to Pasadena . <P> Equally unbeaten but twice tied in nine games , the T-minded Trojans of Southern California would provide the home-team opposition . They all but clinched a second straight appearance in the Rose Bowl by crushing California two weeks ago , made it official last week-with 90,019 witnesses - by drubbing U.C.L.A. 40-to-13 . <P> The other bowl games : Duke and Alabama in New Orleans ' Sugar Bowl ; Texas Christian and the Oklahoma Aggies in Dallas ' Cotton Bowl ; Georgia Tech and Tulsa in Miami 's Orange Bowl .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
