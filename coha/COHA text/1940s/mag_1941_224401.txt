If the accident rate rises in suburban U.S. communities this fall because citizens are hit by flying sticks , insurance companies can blame a game called Kangaroo Golf . Invented and patented by internationally famed Composer-Organist Pietro Yon , virtuoso at Manhattan 's St. Patrick 's Cathedral , it has the same object as golf and can be set up in any good-sized yard ( see cut ) . <P> In the game , wooden pegs ( kangaroos ) are used instead of balls and they are driven from a portable , slope-topped wooden tee-the projecting end of the kangaroo is struck with a sharp downward chop to send it jumping as in tiddlywinks . A set costs $12.50 . There are four different-shaped kangaroos : the Turtle ( for distance ) , the Speeder ( for an accurate second shot ) , the Flash ( to get over a high obstacle ) , the Torpedo ( for a stop-dead approach or putt ) . Players carry their kangaroos in a canvas pouch not unlike a carpenter 's apron . <P> Composer Yon , who thought up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alps , has shot 9 holes in 19 , claims to be world 's champion by virtue of victories over such experts as Cinemactor Roland Young , Tenor Giovanni Martinelli , various members of the Italian royal family .
