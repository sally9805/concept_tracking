Last autumn , just before he got elected Governor of Georgia for the fourth time , turkey-necked , 62-year-old Gene Talmadge was taken with a stomach hemorrhage and went to the hospital . The doctors made him eat poached eggs and he began to recover . Then he rebelled against the doctors . During the Thanksgiving holidays he drove 200 miles to his farm at McRae , Ga . to get some fresh air , healthful exercise and belly filling vittles . He ate fried chicken , ham and grits with red gravy and plenty of hot biscuits . Then he went out with a dog and gun and hunted birds . He drove back to Atlanta and collapsed again . <P> Last week , in Atlanta 's rambling Piedmont Hospital , Gene Talmadge grew terribly ill-he was suffering from hemolytic jaundice and cirrhosis of the liver . When the word got out , scores of policemen and firemen lined up at the hospital to offer blood . The Governor-elect was given transfusions . But he sank into a coma . One night at week 's end he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three weeks before he was to " have supplanted Governor Ellis Arnall in office , the controversial career of Georgia 's " Wild Man from Sugar Creek " came to its end . No contemporary politicians except Louisiana 's Huey Long and Mississippi 's Theodore ( " The Man " ) Bilbo had appealed so successfully to ignorance and bigotry . Gene Talmadge had been vehemently for keeping " the nigger " in his place . He had opposed high wages and labor unions , and had taken a dim view of education for the masses . <P> Red Galluses . He was an attorney and an educated man ( University of Georgia , ' 07 ) and could talk quietly and well . But he never made the mistake of allowing the voters to discover it . He overflowed with leg-slapping rustic humor . Once , when a heckler asked if a man should be punished for beating his wife , he cried : " Depends on how hard you hit her . " He chewed tobacco and smoked at the same time , sometimes dressed up in cowboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barns behind the executive mansion , kept cows , hogs and hens in them . When he shouted campaign speeches he took off his coat to disclose the bright red galluses which became his trademark . <P> Early in his career , as Georgia 's Commissioner of Agriculture , he gambled $11,000 of state funds in the Chicago livestock market . He wanted to prove that Georgia 's peanut-fed hogs were as good as the Midwest 's corn-fed animals . He failed . But he bayed : " Sure I stole the money , but I stole it for you , " and as a result was elected governor in 1932 . <P> During his three terms he ruled autocratically , fought the New Deal , and brought Georgia education to a low estate with his witch hunts in schools and colleges . His rallying cry was " white supremacy . " This week as his body lay in state under the state capitol dome , there stood nearby a huge floral wreath with the inscription " K.K.K.
