Roosevelt to bring ghostwriting into prominence by employing such eminent men as Judge Samuel Rosenman , Playwright Robert Sherwood , Brain Truster Raymond Moley and Poet Archibald MacLeish . Dean of them all , and perhaps the shrewdest , was the late Charley Michelson , longtime pressagent for the Democratic Party , whose typewriter supplied uncounted Democratic bigwigs with taunts that made a whole generation of Republicans miserable . <P> Eloquence for Hire .
