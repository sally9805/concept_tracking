Cuba was tense . New President Ramon Grau San Martin , elected last June by an honest vote , used his popular mandate like a machete . He retired many of Cuba 's swaggering Army officers , announced he would also eliminate Cuba 's cherished botellas ( literally , bottles-soft government jobs ) . Some Cubans were disgruntled , talked of impending revolution . In Havana there were sporadic shootings . <P> But President Grau knew that he had public opinion behind him , and the tacit support of the U.S. Last week , when disturbances continued , Grau went to one source of the trouble . He fired Havana Police Official Donoso , jailed numerous policemen who had been suspected of brutality and killings during the Batista regime . At the same time . Grau warned the troublemakers to settle their differences in court . Eduardo Chibas , Government leader in the Senate , who has a flair for the dramatic , announced : " The President has taken personal command of the maintenance of order in Cuba . " <P> Two policemen were shot to death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did take command , canceled all gun licenses , ordered all civilians disarmed . Cuba breathed more easily .
