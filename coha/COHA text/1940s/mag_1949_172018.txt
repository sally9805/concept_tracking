THE LOTTERY ( 306 pp. ) - Shirley Jackson-Farrar , Straus ( $2.75 ) . <P> <P> When the title story in this collection of tales first appeared in The New Yorker , it brought forth a flood of mail . Few readers were sure they knew what the story meant , but it had dug its way into their minds . <P> On a fine June morning , wrote Shirley Jackson , the whole village began to gather . The children , their pockets stuffed with stones , came first , and three of the boys built a pile of stones in a corner of the square . Then came the men , talking of taxes , crops , the weather . The women , wearing house dresses and sweaters , came last . <P> Unexpected Slip . The ceremony began . Mr. Summers , the leading businessman , was sworn in ; the old black box containing the lottery slips was placed on a stool ; the list of heads of families was read out . So familiar was the ritual that folks hardly listened at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the lottery official , but this time each family head just came up to draw his slip . <P> In the crowd , people chatted quietly . Old Man Warner snorted when he heard that folks in the north village were thinking of giving up the lottery . " Pack of crazy fools . . . nothing 's good enough for them . Next thing you know , they 'll be wanting to go back to living in caves . . . " <P> When Zanini , the last family head , drew his slip , there was a long breathless pause . " Who 's got it ? " Someone replied , " It 's Hutchinson . It 's Bill . " <P> Mrs. Hutchinson protested that it was all unfair , but everyone knew that the lottery had been run in perfect order , and the postmaster quietly went about preparing slips for another drawing in the Hutchinson family . The kids drew first , then the parents . Mrs. Hutchinson drew the slip with the black mark on it . <P> " All right , folks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " By now Tessie Hutchinson was in the middle of a cleared space ; she held her hands out desperately , but the villagers moved in . Old Man Warner kept saying , " Come on , come on , everyone . " Mrs. Hutchinson screamed , " It is n't fair , " but soon the crowd was upon her . A stone hit her on the head . Other stones came hurtling through the air . <P> Expected Swipe . Exactly what this story means each reader may decide for himself ; like much genuinely first-rate fiction , it allows for a variety of interpretations because it reverberates with many possible meanings . But no reader is likely to doubt that it will soon find a place as a minor classic in the American short story , a ruthless fable about the human soul that might have come out of Hawthorne . <P> Unfortunately , nothing else in The Lottery is as good . The other 24 pieces are brightly lacquered sketches trimmed to New Yorker specifications-deadpan , passionless portraits of cruel children , quietly miserable spinsters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shirley Jackson accumulates little piles of irrelevant detail , topples them over with the expected sardonic swipe . If she could break out of this mold , she might become one of the U.S. 's best short-story writers .
