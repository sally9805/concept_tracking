The Japs tried desperately for three and a half years after Pearl Harbor to put an American battleship out of action ? and failed . Where the Japs failed , the Americans succeeded . We put not one , but two of our own most modern dreadnoughts out of action in a few brief , terrible moments at a critical phase of the war ? because we had no scientific method of avoiding ship collisions . Nearly 150 times during World War II the Navy lost , forever or temporarily , vital warships as a result of collisions . The Merchant Marine suffered as many as 10 collisions daily . There were nearly 13,000 collisions in all . They cost a billion and a half dollars , hundreds of lives , and irretrievable time . But the Navy found a way , largely through the efforts of a young reserve officer , virtually to eliminate ship collisions before the war 's end .  | The collision that denied the services of two badly needed battleships to the Pacific Fleet sparked the events that remedied the situation . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken Kwajalein . Saipan , Tinian , Guam , the Palaus , and the Philippines were to follow , but for many anxious weeks after this accident , high-echelon councils wondered whether the scheduled offensive should be continued without the two battlewagons . Battleships , at that phase of the war , had just been robed with a new importance . It had been discovered that these monsters , given a main deck full of antiaircraft guns , could provide a steel shield under which aircraft carriers , spearhead of the fleet , could move within excursion-boat distance of enemy shores . The two ill-starred battleships were , in fact , tantalizingly close to the Jap homeland when the setback occurred . The Fast Task Force in which they were operating was looking for trouble . It found it , however , in a most undesirable shape , the shape of its own ships . At four o'clock in the morning , Battleship A was ordered to leave the formation . She started to pull off to the left , when her radar picked up a group of ships on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came right , in an attempt to cross Battleship B 's bow . When the captains of the two ships realized they were on a collision course , they resorted to the thencurrent collision-prevention doctrine of turning toward each other 's stern . Battleship B got her bow knocked off in the ensuing crash , and was out of action for many weeks . Battleship A was damaged and was out for a lesser time . At least six men lost their lives . Under the system evolved after this tragic mishap , Battleship A , by pulling ahead for some distance before turning out when ordered to leave the formation , would have avoided the collision . The new system was part of the revolution in naval warfare that was necessitated by World War II . The Navy 's fleet , at Pearl Harbor numbered in hundreds , contained more than 90,000 units by V-J Day . The old fleet line , moving majestically , was  | replaced by the Fast Task Force . This force numbered hundreds of vessels , bows splitting swells at 20 to 30 knots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's radar-controlled gunfire , rocket and torpedo attack by aircraft , submarine wolfpacks , and all the other new weapons of war . The old preradar doctrine of avoiding collision , based on " when in danger , turn toward the stern of the other ship , " just was n't working , and it was n't working so often that , following the battleship accident , then Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz called attention to the mounting collision rate in a letter to the Pacific Fleet and made it incumbent on all commanding officers to give renewed consideration to the fundamentals of safe maneuvering . Not only was the number of collisions disturbing , but so was the nature of many of them . On a black night in the far western Pacific a ship , with newly installed radar , picked up an approaching vessel at 33,000 yards . Engrossed with their new instrument , the Radar Plot crew tracked the other ship with amazing accuracy ? right up to the moment the two ships met head-on . In their absorption , they had neglected to inform the captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a steady bearing ? the two danger signals which experienced officers know spell COLLISION ! " The two vessels had been n a perfect collision course for 17 miles ! On another dark night , two destroyers were screening a Fast Carrier Task Force . Both captains were snatching forty winks in their sea-cabins . Running on a parallel course , the formation was ordered to commence the zigzag plan at 20 knots . Ship A came right , while Ship B ? which had failed to receive the radio order for zigzag ? continued on a steady course . The next zig sent Ship A away from B. Then B noticed what its deck officer considered A 's apparent difficulty in holding course , so B came left in an effort to maintain station . A zigged right and actually passed astern of B , placing A starboard of B. The conning controlling officers of the ships then were looking for each other 's vessel on the wrong side ! A 's next zig pointed her bow : irectly at B 's beam . B failed to sight A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight B , as she was still looking for B on the wrong side . B used rudder and engines to avert collision , but sounded no whistle signals and used no lights . B 's TBS ( TalkBetween-Ships radio ) was inoperative , so she could n't warn orally . A serious collision resulted . At the time Admiral Nimitz 's letter on avoiding collisions was circulated throughout the Pacific Fleet , the records were full of collision cases where conning officers had erred either in commission or in omission through failure to utilize all their tools , such as radar , lights , whistles , and radio . Aboard the minesweeper U. S. S. Clamour , 32-year-old Lt. Comdr . Davis Newton Lott , the skipper , who had interrupted a movieradio career to fight the Axis , read the Admiral 's letter , and set to thinking . Lott had written two naval texts dealing with ship recogni- tion and avoidance of collisions . He had an idea . He talked it over with his junior officers . They liked it . It was this : Set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equipment used in conning a ship . Reproduce actual sounds . Study past collisions and , from the causes , evolve a uniform emergency shiphandling procedure so standardized that skippers of any two ships would know in advance what maneuver the other was most likely to execute . Simulate collision situations and train officers to think in split seconds , but in terms of comfortable safety margins . Back in port at Pearl Harbor , Lott sold the idea , and he was named Officer-inCharge . Ten days later he opened his first classroom . " It was pretty crude , " he recalls . " All equipment was handmade of stuff we pulled off scrap heaps , and there was n't much equipment even at that . What we did n't have , we invented . But our student officers were patient . We passed out questionnaires soliciting criticism , and got plenty . As a result , the course , as it stands now , is the work of thousands of officers . " There is n't a single lecture in the curriculum . " Fast-moving as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's goal . The course quickly gained an overwhelming acceptance . Even officers on short shore leave after months at sea gave up priceless hours to attend . Six months after the first class , collision rates in the Pacific began to drop . At the war 's end , collisions had been virtually eliminated . Lott was installing new schools on the mainland for postwar use . How was it done ? The magic was the realism with which Lott imbued the course . The secret was making young officers realize that they had to reckon with the speed and course of the other ship , as well as of their own . For instance , one ship is steaming north , another ship southeast , both making 15 knots . When these ships are still 1,850 yards ( more than a mile ) apart , their courses will intersect and they will collide in just two minutes ? 120 seconds ? if some action is not taken . Their relative speed ( the combined speed at which they are closing on each other ) , called range rate by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexperienced officers would realize . AND the time left to act is short ! Another example : One ship is heading due east , another due north , both making 34 knots . When they are 1,655 yards apart , just 60 seconds are left before the crash . However , at the 1,655-yard range , if the eastbound ship executes a left turn , it will miss the other ship by 750 yards ; if it turns right , it will miss by 550 yards . The curriculum at the Emergency Shiphandling Schools established 500 yards as the minimum safety margin to be considered for small vessels , and 1,000 yards for large . This Lott and his colleagues  | pounded , drilled , and hammered into the student officers ' heads . These same heads were buzzing after the intensive course , which winds up with these final exams : An entire day is spent in making simulated runs . First , daytime runs are simulated ; then night runs , during which the " ships " are followed by their lights . Then come the difficult poor-visibility runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In all of these runs , actual collision cases are reproduced and the conning officers of the two ships are thrown into sudden and imminent " danger " by the instructor , who manipulates the shiphandling gear to reproduce the error that was made in the original collision . This might have been a TBS ( Talk-Between-Ships ) radio failure , causing one ship to fail to receive a turn signal ; a junior officer turning the wrong way in formation , with the captain lacking time to get up to the bridge in time to avoid the collision ; or a rudder casualty suddenly throwing two ships onto a collision course . During these runs , every situation and condition is simulated with great realism . The conning officers are on their " bridges , " booth-like enclosures from which they can not see the junior officers of the deck . These JOODs , equipped with all the aids they have on shipboard , sight on model ships , and relay ' bearings and ranges to the conning officers on the ships ' intercommunication system . They must physically carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the student must actually press the button , and the buzzer sounds . This auditory realism is carried to the point of dropping a pile of scrap iron on a steel floor in the next room at the instant of a collision . On the " bridge " the captain has his steersman , ship 's telegraph ( by which orders are transmitted to the engine room ) , radio , radar scope , and ship 's intercom . He " cons " through binoculars that are reversed to create the illusion of distance . After each run , action taken by the student officers is evaluated , and mistakes are pointed out . JOs are reminded forcibly that the captain would rather lose his sleep than his ship . Occasionally , an officer encrusted with years of sea experience dropped in at the school to snort his disbelief of the need for any kind of shiphandling procedure in an emergency . Having conned by the seat of his pants for years , he 'd be damned , sir , if he needed any newfangled ideas to help him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would the captain care to " con " a case ? The captain could n't very gracefully refuse . So they would give him a really tough collision case that had actually occurred an end-on case where both vessels were approaching at a relative speed of 60 knots . a situation in which the slightest hesitation or misstep on the part of either captain would make a collision inevitable . When the " crash " occurred , the boys in the back room would let go with the scrap iron . After one treatment , even the crustiest sea dog calmed down considerably . One senior officer went through the course . conning his ship beautifully out of collision after collision . Afterwards , he made himself known to Lott as the skipper of one of the ships in a collision which had been recreated in the course . He said he had been sleeping when the collision occurred , and because his junior officer had n't recognized the danger signs in time he had not been called to the bridge . The new training has tremendous implications for peacetime merchant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is planning a course which will prove that the new art is yet in its infancy . He is drawing plans for an auditoriumsize classroom where a dozen or more ships can be conned simultaneously from enclose : bridges , with results visible on a screen at the front of the room . Between the bridges and the screen will be seats for a large number of students . Behind and above the bridges will be a bank of projectors , each of which will throw on the screen the movements of one ship , as the skippers issue their orders . Inside two of the bridges , each captain will have a simulated radar scope on which he can watch the movements of all the other ships , with his ship indicated in the center . Thus , involved convoy and taskforce problems can be worked out . The equipment will be electronically operated , and with it Lott hopes to simulate every conceivable situation at sea . His postwar aims are : 1 ? To have every prospective deck officer go through the school and pass a standard shiphandling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shiphandling test every four years , and to go back to school if he fails .  |
