txt One hundred and eighy million Europeans , according to Director General Herbert H. Lehman of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration , are right now " on the border line of starvation . " In China many more people are probably much worse off . It is to meet such immediate and urgent needs that UNRRA was established two years ago . UNRRA was not to be permanent . It was to take no more than 1 per cent of the estimated income of the contributing nations for the fiscal year ended June 30 , 1943 . For the United States this sum , originally authorized by the joint resolution of March 28 , 1944 , was to be $1,350 , - 000,000 . Of this total Congress made $800,000,000 available . At the end of last August all but $20,000,000 had been spent or committed . Other countries had contributed or made available about $668,000,000 more . This , too , seems to be about gone . At UNRRA 's recent London conference the statement was made that $1,800,000,000 would be needed from all sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked to make available the $550,000,000 which was authorized last year but not at that time appropriated . We are committed to spend this much . Why there is so much hesitation when people are dying for lack of help is one of the mysteries of Capitol Hill . Twice this month , once in a letter to Speaker Rayburn and once in the message conveying UNRRA 's last report , President Trurwm has urged the necessity for early action . Results have not been evident , though the House has found time to debate some pretty trivial subjects . But the $550,000,000 to which we are committed will not be enough . We ought to spend , and President Truman has intimated that he will ask , at least $1,350,000,000 additional . That is , our tat , 91 contribution to UNRRA ought to be 1 per cent of two years ' income , or $2,270,000,000 . What has been bought and what can be bought with these funds ? In order of money value UNRRA has provided ClOttang , textiles and footwear ; foods , fate , oils , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies and equipment ; transportation equipment . It has cared for displaced persons . It has fought epidemics . It has saved hundreds of thousands of lives in Greece , other thousands in Czechoslovakia , Yugoslavia , Poland and Italy . It is preparing to undertake a massive relief problem in liberated China . After some initial mistakes and the removal of some initial impediments , UNRRA is now organized to do this work . It just needs money . There is not much time . Sick and hungry people can not wait for prolonged parliamentary procedure . The cold is deepening throughout the northern hemisphere , all around the world . People look to the United States , one of forty-four nations signing the UNRRA agreemeitt , and , with the nations of the British Commonwealth , contributor of most of the needed money . We shall not miss 1 per cent of our income or annual food supply . Even if we did miss the 1 per cent we should not grudge it . UNRRA is not an instrument of policy  --  it is , like the Red Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Congress should act without further delay .
