There is a fellow in a small-town prison cell , tapping slowly on the floor with a spoon . After tapping half a minute as if he were trying to telegraph words , he gets up and begins walking around the cell . At last he stops , stands at the centre of the cell , and does n't move for a long time . He feels his head , as if it were wounded . Then he looks around . Then he calls out . YOUNG MAN Hello  --  out there ! ( Pause ) Hello  --  out there ! ( Long pause ) Hello  --  out there ! ( A GIRL 'S voice is heard . ) THE GIRL Hello . YOUNG MAN Is that you , Katey ?

Listen  --  go get me a gun . p. 17 THE GIRL I could get my father 's gun . I know where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind the cigarettes . Run all the way . ( THE GIRL turns and runs . The YOUNG MAN stands at the centre of the cell a long time . THE GIRL comes running back in . Almost crying . ) THE GIRL I 'm afraid . I 'm afraid I wo n't see you again . If I come back and you 're not here , I  --  It 's so lonely in this town . I 'll stay here . I wo n't let them take you away . YOUNG MAN Listen , Katey . Do what I tell you . Go get that gun and come back . Maybe they wo n't come tonight . Maybe they wo n't come at all . I 'll hide the gun and when they let me out you can take it back and put it where you found it . And then we 'll go away , Now , hurry  --  THE GIRL All right . ( Pause ) I want to tell you something . YOUNG MAN O.K. THE GIRL ( Very softly ) If you 're not here when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun and I 'll know what to do with it . YOUNG MAN You know how to handle a gun ? THE GIRL I know how . YOUNG MAN Do n't be a fool . ( Takes off his shoe , brings out some currency ) Do n't be a fool , see ? Here 's some money . Eighty dollars . Take it and go to San Francisco . Look around and find somebody . Find somebody alive and halfway human , see ? Promise me  --  if I 'm not here when you come back , just throw the gun away and go to San Francisco .

I 've got a couple of dollars in my other shoe . I 'll see you in San Francisco . THE GIRL ( With wonder ) San Francisco ? YOUNG MAN That 's right  --  San Francisco . That 's where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to go to some place like San Francisco  --  but how could I go alone ? YOUNG MAN Well , you 're not alone any more , see ? THE GIRL Tell me a little what it 's like . YOUNG MAN ( Very swiftly , almost impatiently at first , but gradually slower and with remembrance , smiling and THE GIRL moving closer to him as he speaks ) Well , it 's on the Pacific to begin with  --  ocean all around . Cool fog and sea-gulls . Ships from all over the world . It 's got seven hills . The little streets go up and down , around and all over . Every night the fog-horns bawl . But they wo n't be bawling for you and me . THE GIRL Are people different in San Francisco ? YOUNG MAN People are the same everywhere . They 're different only when they love somebody . That 's the only thing that makes ' em different . More people in San Francisco love somebody , that 's all . p. 19 THE GIRL Nobody anywhere loves anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whispering ) Hearing you say that , a man could die and still be ahead of the game . Now , hurry . And do n't forget , if I 'm not here when you come back , I 'll meet you in San Francisco . ( THE GIRL stands a moment looking at him , then backs away , turns and runs . The YOUNG MAN stares after her , troubled and smiling . He sits down suddenly and buries his head in his hands . From a distance the sound of several automobiles approaching is heard . He listens . Several automobile doors are slammed . A wooden door is opened with a key , then slammed , and footsteps are heard in a hall . Walking easily , almost casually , and yet arrogantly , a MAN comes in . The YOUNG MAN jumps up suddenly and shouts at the MAN , almost scaring him ) What the hell kind of a jail-keeper are you , anyway ? Why do n't you attend to your business ? You get paid for it , do n't you ? Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not the jail-keeper . YOUNG MAN Yeah ? Well , who are you , then ? THE MAN I 'm the husband . YOUNG MAN What husband are you talking about ? THE MAN You know what husband . p. 20 YOUNG MAN Hey ! ( Pause , looking at THE MAN ) Are you the guy that hit me over the head last night ? THE MAN I am . YOUNG MAN ( With righteous indignation ) What do you mean going around hitting people over the head ? THE MAN Oh , I do n't know . What do you mean going around  --  the way you do ? YOUNG MAN ( Rubbing his head ) You hurt my head . You got no right to hit anybody over the head . THE MAN ( Suddenly angry , shouting ) Answer my question ! What do you mean ? YOUNG MAN Listen , you  --  do n't be hollering at me just because I 'm locked up . You think you 're the husband . You 're the husband of nothing . THE MAN ( Draws a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shoot  --  ( Softly ) and spoil the fun . What 'll your pals think ? They 'll be disappointed , wo n't they ? What 's the fun hanging a man who 's already dead ? ( THE MAN puts the gun away ) I know you 've come to tell me what you 're going to do . Well , you do n't need to tell me . I know what you 're going to do . I 've read the papers and I know . A mob of ' em fall on one man and beat him , do n't they ? They tear off his clothes and kick him , do n't they ? And women and little children stand around watching , do n't they ? Well , before you go on this holiday , I 'm going to tell you a few things . You 've been outraged . A stranger has come to town and violated your pure , innocent , virtuous women . You 've got to set this thing right . You 're home-makers , and you beat your children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know she was your wife . I did n't know she was anybody 's wife . p. 21 THE MAN You 're a liar ! YOUNG MAN Sometimes  --  but not this time . Do you want to hear about it ? ( THE MAN does n't answer ) All right , I 'll tell you the truth , as God 's my witness . I met her at a lunch counter . She came in and sat next to me . There was plenty of room , but she sat next to me . Somebody put a nickel in the phonograph and a fellow was singing " New San Antonio Rose . " Well , she got to talking about the song . I thought she was talking to the waiter , but he did n't answer her , so I answered her . That 's how I met her . I did n't think anything of it . We left the place together and started walking . The first thing I knew she said : This is where I live . THE MAN You 're a dirty liar ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( THE MAN does not answer ) O.K. She asked me to come in . Maybe she had something in mind , maybe not . Did n't make any difference to me , one way or the other . If she was lonely , all right . If not , all right . THE MAN You 're telling a lot of dirty lies ! YOUNG MAN I 'm telling the truth . Maybe your wife 's out there with your pals . Well , call her in . I got nothing against her , or you  --  or any of you . Call her in , and ask her a few questions . Are you in love with her ? ( THE MAN does n't answer ) Well , that 's too bad . p. 22 THE MAN What do you mean ? YOUNG MAN I mean this may not be the first time something like this has happened . THE MAN ( Swiftly ) Shut up ! YOUNG MAN Oh , you know it . You 've always known it . You 're afraid of your pals , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wanted . I would n't be here now if I had given her some money . THE MAN ( Slowly ) How much did she ask for ? YOUNG MAN I did n't ask how much . I told her I 'd made a mistake . She said she would make trouble if I did n't give her some money . Well , I do n't like bargaining , and I do n't like being threatened , so I told her to get the hell away from me . The next thing I knew she 'd run out of the house and was hollering . ( Pause ) Now , why do n't you go out there and tell ' em they took me to another jail  --  go home and pack up and leave her ? You 're a good guy , you 're just afraid of your pals . ( THE MAN draws his gun again . He is very frightened . He moves a step towards the YOUNG MAN , then fires three times . The YOUNG MAN falls to his knees . THE MAN turns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent forward . THE GIRL comes running in , and halts suddenly , looking at him. ) p. 23 THE GIRL There were some people in the street , men and women and kids  --  so I came in through the back , through a window . I could n't find the gun . I looked all over but I could n't find it . What 's the matter ? YOUNG MAN Nothing  --  nothing . Everything 's all right . Listen . Listen , Katey ! Get out of here ! Go out the way you came in and run  --  run like hell  --  run all night ! Get to another town and get on a train . Do you hear ? THE GIRL What 's happened ? YOUNG MAN Get away  --  just get away from here ! Take any train that 's going  --  you can get to San Francisco later . THE GIRL ( Almost sobbing ) I do n't want to go any place without you . YOUNG MAN I ca n't go . Something 's happened . ( He looks at her ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love you , and I 've got some money in my other shoe , and when you 've got money you can do any- thing . ( He falls forward . THE GIRL stands near him , then begins to sob softly , walking away . She stands over to one side , stops sobbing , and stares out . The excitement of the mob outside increases . THE MAN , with two of his PALS , comes running in . THE GIRL watches , unseen. ) p. 24 THE MAN Here 's the son of a bitch ! ANOTHER MAN O.K. Open the cell , Harry . ( The THIRD MAN goes to the cell door , unlocks it , and swings it open . A WOMAN comes running in . ) THE WOMAN Where is he ? I want to see him . Is he dead ? ( Looking down at him , as the MEN pick him up ) There he is . ( Pause ) Yeah , that 's him . ( Her husband looks at her with contempt , then at the dead man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over with . THIRD MAN Right you are , George . Give me a hand , Harry . ( They lift the body . ) THE GIRL ( Suddenly , fiercely ) Put him down ! THE MAN What 's this ? SECOND MAN What are you doing in here ? Why are n't you out in the street with the others ? THE GIRL Put him down and go away ( She runs towards the MEN . THE WOMAN grabs her . ) THE WOMAN Here  --  where do you think you 're going ? THE GIRL Let me go . You 've got no right to take him away . p. 25 THE WOMAN Well , listen to her , will you ? ( She slaps THE GIRL and pushes her to the floor ) Listen to the little slut , will you ? ( They ALL go , carrying the YOUNG MAN 's body . THE GIRL gets up slowly , no longer sobbing . She looks around at everything , then whispers )               @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
