Then he was charged by three buffalo bulls . He escaped again , " inclined to believe it all enchantment if the thorns of the prickly pear piercing his feet did not dispel at every moment the illusion . " <P> Steamboats and Gold . Much of the country along the Missouri is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vestal was writing The Missouri near Sioux City , Iowa , the wild geese , held up in their spring flight by a six-inch snow , made such a racket that sleep was impossible .

" The greenhorn scooped up panfuls of clean gold . <P> Turbulent and clear in its headwaters , the Missouri changes its character after its junction with the turbid waters of the Yellowstone , changes again as it meanders through the prairies to earn its nickname of " Big Muddy " and empty at last into the Mississippi ten miles above St. Louis . The longest U.S. river ( 2,470 miles ) , it is also one of the most dangerous in flood . Forever seeking its lost channel ( it once flowed north to Hudson Bay ) , the Missouri is also the hungriest of U.S. rivers , with a yearly menu of " ten thousand acres of good rich farming land , several miles of railroad , a few hundred houses , a forest or two and uncounted miles of sandbars .
