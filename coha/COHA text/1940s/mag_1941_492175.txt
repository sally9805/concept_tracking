BENEATH the masthead of the Bradford County Telegraph is this : The Home of the Sweetest Strawberries This Side of Heaven . Six months ago a resident of Starke , Florida , would have read this description of his county with customary complacency . Today , he 's too busy to read it at all . National defense , $27,500,000 worth , is raining greenbacks at his front door , and in the words of Walter McFashion , bootblack at the Three Friends Barber Shop , " Business am busted loose ! " For a few miles east of town Uncle Sam is raising from the blackjack oak , pine and sand of North Florida one of the country 's largest Army training centers , Camp Albert H. Blanding . It is mushrooming into Florida 's fourth largest city , and little Starke is reeling from a shot of financial adrenalin . Until last fall Starke was a rural community of 1500 souls , in a fertile county forty miles southwest of Jacksonville ; a town with two traffic lights and an oak-shaded courthouse , where everyone knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell with the annual strawberry crop . When the berries were plentiful , sweet , and big as golf balls , Starke smiled . When the crop was bad  --  well , the town hoped next year would be better . Now a cascade of coin from Camp Blanding 's $3,000,000 monthly civilian and Army pay rulls and a $27,500,000 construction program , has left the town bulging at the seams with 5000 additional persons . Store owners report gains of 1100 per cent compared with business a year ago . Bank deposits and postal receipts have more than doubled , and in three months Starke has seen more buildings started than in the past ten years . Room rents alone are netting the town a new income of $4000 a week . An overtaxed sewer system is threatening an epidemic . The county and city jails are jammed . Rents have trebled and quadrupled . Money is being made hand over fist , it is true , but when you ask a local citizen how the boom has affected the lives of the residents he answers , " Lives ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Starke , Camp Blanding was designated a major defense project months after new Army and naval air bases and training stations began to burgeon in Florida . Now , in the hue and cry of larger cities asking for Government aid in meeting housing problems and the like , Starke 's plea for help has not yet been heard . For while Camp Blanding was still a small National Guard center , major naval air stations were springing up at Jacksonville and Miami , Pensacola was expanding , and other stations were being established at Green Cove Springs and Banana River . The Army had placed its new Southeastern Air Base , MacDill Field , at Tampa , and other bases had been parceled out to Orlando , West Palm Beach and Lakeland . Later , Valpariso and Tallahassee were designated bases for the Army air corps . Starke has been notified that it can receive no Federal aid until it is officially placed in a national-defense area . The Impact of Defense TN 1939 Jacksonville bought the site of a Florida I National Guard camp in its own county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southeastern naval air station . Realizing $400,000 from the deal , the Florida state-armory hoard cast about for a site on which to build a new camp . It chose a dry , rolling , mosquitoless area surrounding Kingsley Lake , seven miles east of Starke . One narrow highway , now clogged with traffic day and night , led from Starke to the camp and on to Jacksonville . The lake had lung been a popular fishing ground and summer resort . Work began on the new camp in the winter of 1939 40 . The plans were modest . It was to cost around $700,000 and was to be used two weeks every summer by Florida National Guardsmen . It took its name from General Blanding , recently chief of the National Guard Bureau and once commanding officer of the 31st IDixiel Division . Rumors that Camp Blanding was destined to become something bigger than a summer trainingcenter for the National Guard multiplied with the accelerated national-defense program . The rumors were correct . Early in the summer , the War Department announced that the 31st Division , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year training at the camp after the National Guard was mobilized . But this was not all . Still another division , the 43d , from Maine , Vermont , Connecticut and Rhode Island , was assigned to the camp . A couple of corps-artillery regiments were thrown in , and two observation squadrons attached to the two divisions were told they would spend the year bivouacked at the Jacksonville Municipal Airport . Blanding was in the big time . Around 50,000 troops would be stationed there by early spring . Listings of available rental property in Bradford County and near-by communities were drawn up and made ready for the first . arrivals . A Chamber of Commerce was organized and a housing questionnaire was sent to hundreds of National Guard officers who had been assigned to Blanding . But in the town no change had taken place and news of activity on Kingsley Lake was rare . Then the news broke . Millions of dollars were authorized for construction of a training center for 40,000 soldiers . A New York firm was awarded a $10,000,000 contract to build Camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a military city with facilities for 60,000 , and greatly increased expenditures brought the estimated cost to $27,500,000 . Officials of the company came to Jacksonville to tell labor-union heads they would need 7000 workmen , most of them carpenters , at once . Word spread over the state in forty-eight hours that there was a ready job and ready cash for the asking at Kingsley Lake , The camp 's construction quartermaster paid a visit to Starke and bought up every handsaw in town . Starke blinked . Early one October morning , sleepy-eyed townspeople leaned out of their windows to see what was the matter . Jalopies were JCorstinued en Page 98 , 9 Continued from Page 13 ) rumbling along the main street in a procession that extended out of sight both ways . A landslide of workers had descended upon Camp Blanding . Overnight every room in Starke was taken . The town filled up as if some hidden dam of humanity had been dynamited . The contractors cried for more and more workers , and the rate of employment rose from 500 to 1600 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor compound outside the employment offices at Blanding was a milling throng . Skilled and unskilled labor from the North arrived . One batch of dull Boston workmen was hired . The supply of skilled labor in the North Florida area had been exhausted in a fortnight . Hundreds of freight cars with millions of feet of raw lumber , gondola cars filled with lime rock fur roads , and fiat cars with derricks and drag lines streamed into a town where , a month before , freight trains highballed by without stopping . Cranes were busy all day wafting materials into waiting trucks from the camp until a new spur line was cut through . The stuff could n't come in fast enough . Blanding 's labor population was climbing to a peak of 21,000 men with a monthly pay roll of $2,500,000 . A vacant bed in Starke was snapped up before its previous occupant had packed his pajamas . Workmen earning as much as ten dollars a day were forced to live in their cars , in tents and hastily erected lean-tos on the outskirts of linen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rude camps sprang up along the narrow , jammed highway between the camp and town , camps where there were no sanitary facilities and life was dusty by day and cold by night . Some workers pooled their resources and traveled a hundred miles back and forth from Jacksonville or sixty-four from Gainesville standing up in trucks . A work train carted 1000 men from Jacksonville to the camp at dawn and took them home at night . Housing the Homeless A cold wave hit North Florida . Temperatures dropped below freezing every night for a week . Men with no tents over them slept by smoldering fires along both sides of the Blanding high- Migratory workers came from Georgia and the Carolinas . They parked their ancient cars in the woods off the highway and lived in trucks with crude homemade bodies , in handmade trailers , lean-tos , tarpaulin shelters , cardboard-box huts and brush piles hollowed out for sleeping . A visiting investigator from the House committee studying interstate migration of labor declared the situation the worst presented to the committee . Finally areas for camping were marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camp had reached a saturation point and the No Labor Wanted signs were hung out , most of the migrants still unemployed drifted off to South Florida . The Chamber of Commerce went to those housewives who still refused to take in boarders and told them it was their patriotic duty to give the men shelter . The recalcitrants backed down until 5000 men had found beds in Starke . And still men with money in their pockets slept on benches in the courthouse , on lawns and on the sidewalks . Families who had never taken in roomers in their lives moved into their first-floor rooms and turned over the rest of the house to Blanding workers . Some managed to squeeze twenty-one men into their homes . Beds were put in garages . Anxious roomers at one house built the owner an addition rather than move to make way for family relatives . Apartments that used to lease for eighteen dollars and twenty dollars soon went for fifty dollars and sixty dollars . A waitress at a restaurant paid five dollars a week for a kitchen cut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in advance , for beds in a garage and board , and found the camp trucks could n't get them to town in time for supper . Prosperity 's Camp Followers One landlady who had rented an apartment to a regular tenant for twenty dollars a month was offered sixty dollars for the same rooms . She compromised by doubling the rent of her regular tenant . Officers ' wives with children paid sixty-five dollars for a bedroom , bath and kitchenette in Keystone Heights , a tiny community a few miles to the south . A carpenter from Cincinnati refused to give his name to a newspaper reporter because he feared his friends at home might discover he was sharing a garage with three other men . " I do n't want them to know how I 'm living , " he said . Starke 's housing situation has become aggravated with the arrival of the 21st Division at Camp Blanding . The 42d arrives this month . A small number of homes , financed by FHA-insured mortgages , has been authorized and a project of high-rental camp cottages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2000 workmen have been housed at Camp Blanding in a special " craftsmen 's barracks , " which is known less euphemistically as a labor camp , and around 150 civil-service employees are putting up at a " white-collar " hotel on the reservation . But in Starke thirty people continue to use one bathroom . The Chamber of Commerce is conducting a campaign for 200 new Federally financed houses , but there is no indication yet that it will succeed . Its most difficult job is finding decent quarters for the wives of soldiers and officers . While Starke 's privacy disappeared into thin air with the influx of Blanding workmen into its homes , other changes were taking place in the town too . One of diem occurred in the girth of Postmaster Fred F. Stump . This robust gentleman dropped fifteen pounds in the first three weeks of the Blanding rush . Three-for-a-dime photographers , fortunetellers , dart-game , shooting-gallery and bowling-alley operators set up their noisy emporiums around town . Gaunt country fiddlers , accordion players , the halt , the lame and the blind lined Call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overnight along roads dotted with hitchhikers . Laborers drank themselves silly on pay-envelope cash and were ( Continued en Page 100 ) I Continued from Page 98 ) packed like sardines into City Jailer Ben Rowe 's four-man jail . More policemen were added to Starke 's constabulary . There were n't sufficient funds in the city treasury to pay for their salaries . But back in 1906 , Bradford County had gone dry ; so what more natural than to have the saloonkeepers on the outskirts of town pay the wages of the new policemen ? Once a month the chief of police pays a visit to the tavern boys to see how they 're behaving . Legally , they are not supposed to operate at all , but they toe the line by paying fifty-dollar fines regularly into the city treasury . The smaller bars pay twenty-five dollars . Chiselers , however , are spotted in a minute , and Starke has maintained order . The presence of undesirables is known almost at once through the operation of an uncanny grapevine system , and they get their choice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New buildings have altered Starke so much , old-timers do n't recognize the place . New stores , filling stations , automobile showrooms , jewelry shops , a new moving-picture theater and additions to houses , representing a cost to investors of more than $134,000 , are under construction everywhere . This does not include a new $40,000 post office , which was planned when Camp Blanding was still a heap of underbrush . A group of eight buildings is to be started by a New York financier . At first , construction was stymied by a paradoxical dearth of carpenters . Seven miles away there were thousands of them . Every other roomer was a carpenter , but the trouble was that they were all working for the Government . A restaurant-chain operator came to town , acquired a number of sites and ordered soda fountains . But when they arrived he could get no one to install them . He finally left in disgust . County schools , already overcrowded last year , have had a 10 per cent increase in enrollment . By state law , Starke can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must pay five dollars a month for the first child enrolled and two dollars and fifty cents a month for each additional child . Twenty-six teachers are looking after 1000 school children . And since there is no money fur janitors , the Starke comes to life every day in three rushes . They correspond directly to the changes of shift at the camp . Early in the morning the day shift piles into thousands of cars and crawls over the highway to work . Things are quiet until late in the afternoon when the shift comes off . It is then that the streets are overflowing and you are lucky if you can avoid being knocked off the sidewalk into the street by the mob . Soldiers mingle with the crowd and throng into stores , adding their own pay to the boom . Occasionally the ambulance of the Starke funeral parlor threads its way down Call Street , siren screaming , to pick up the injured from another automobile accident on the Blanding highway . The victims are taken all the way to Jacksonville , for there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made seven trips in one day . Merchants are unanimous in reporting top sales . The record is probably held by Joe Alvarez , who has run a men's-furnishings store in Starke since ( Continued on Page 102 ) , I1 Woman at the Helm She comes from Lawton , Oklahoma , where she did Chamber of Commerce work in an Army town Fort Sill is near by . She came to Florida last spring for a rest , but learned that a big Army training center was planned near Starke . Knowing what lay in store for the little town , she decided to sell Starke a Chamber of Commerce . Having first obtained the approval of the state adjutant general , she called on a real-estate man whose name she noticed on a signboard near town and asked , " Who 's the secretary of your Chamber of Commerce ? " " I am , " he replied . " But our organization has been inactive for years . " " I 'd like to start one , " she said . " Fine . I think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't support it . It 's never supported a Chamber of Commerce yet . " Three days later Mrs. Stephens was the paid secretary of a newly created Starke chamber . From the day she opened her office , Mrs. Stephens has held the helm that has guided Starke through its most difficult days . It was she who called upon housewives to take in Camp Blanding workmen and who told merchants not to be afraid to overorder their stocks . She has done a magnificent job and Starke is outspoken in its gratitude . There is no time now for the board of directors of the Chamber of Corn merce to meet except on street corners between customers . Mrs. Stephens has to act first and get approval later . Her single-room office is a madhouse . Laborers , officers , soldiers , women come to her for assistance . The Chamber of Commerce is Starke 's welfare , charity and miscellaneous social agencies all rolled into one . Some of her room applicants Mrs. Stephens sends to towns forty and fifty miles away . The Chamber of Commerce secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she writes Washington about conditions in Starke . Once , for example , Washing-ton assured her that no housing facilities could he constructed off the Blanding reservation and that the War Department had instructed National Guardsmen not to bring their families with them . Ji Vision of the Future " At this point , " she says , " I thought of the old story of the admiral issuing orders that no wives were to follow their husbands when the fleet visited China . One of the officers wrote the admiral and said : ' My wife has read your orders , sir , but she refuses to obey . ' I decided Starke should find out for itself whether the guardsmen intended to bring their families or not . " A housing questionnaire was sent to all officers , and , with one or two exceptions , all said they would bring their families and wanted accommodations near the camp . A few said they would pay $100 a month and live 100 miles away if rooms for their families could he found no nearer to town . Florida congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordinator from the Washington office of the National Defense Advisory Commission , termed Starke 's sewage system its worst problem . Septic tanks built several years ago can no longer dispose of waste , and raw sewage is being piped into a near-by creek . Mrs. Stephens envisions Starke as the eventual renter of a district Chamber of Commerce working for all the small towns in the vicinity , as the site of a glass factory utilizing the sand in the Blanding area , and as the crossroads of Florida , where traveling men will he happy to put up for the night . She sees , too , the increase of county dairy herds , truck-farm acreage and the possible establishment of a canning plant or a pulpwood mill . All this , she feels , may be achieved if troops continue to train at Camp Blanding for the next five years . Mayor Newnan ( " Noon " ) Wainwright , whose administration began almost on the day of the first surge of workmen into Camp Blanding , and Gene Matthews , of the Bradford County Telegraph , share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are doing all in their power to get state aid for the building of a hospital , new water wells , a sewage-disposal plant , and the paving and widening of streets . The editor of the county newspaper , writing an anniversary editorial , puts it this way : We have come , with Starke , through all the ups and downs from the freeze of the 1890 's to the depression of the 1930 's . And now we stand , with Starke , on the brink of the greateal adventure of them all  --  the turn of the wheel of fate that made our community the site of Camp Blanding , the country 's largest national-defense training center . You ca n't beat a town with a spirit like that .
