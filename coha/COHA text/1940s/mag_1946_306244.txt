The crowds had come to see the Byron Nelsons , the Sam Sneads , the Ben Hogans . Of the other 130 hopefuls entered in the $10,000 St. Petersburg Open Tournament , only 20 had much chance to finish in the money . The rest had a cheerful name for themselves : the dew sweepers . <P> They were the also-rans of golf who were assigned the early morning starting times , so that the afternoons could be kept for the crowd-drawing stars . During wartime 1944 , only 25 players competed in the " grapefruit " circuit , now the woods and the fairways were full of them . <P> Most of the dew sweepers at St. Petersburg , as at the other tournaments in the Florida winter " grapefruit " circuit , were country-club pros-big frogs in the little puddles and big bunkers back home . They did n't look as good against pro golf 's Big 20 as they did against the local businessmen . Said Gene Sarazen , watching one of them practice earnestly for the next day 's dawn patrol : " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving lessons . " <P> A rarer kind of dew sweeper was the amateur : at Florida prices , few could afford amateur standing . The dawn patrol slept in auto camps and trailers . They lived on hamburgers and Cokes . In the last few months , six top amateurs have turned pro . Said one of them , Fred Haas Jr. : " It cost me $6,000 to expense myself through 25 tourneys last year . That 's costly . " Almost the only amateurs left were well-to-do businessmen who can break par , but can not break into the Big 20 . They get a kick out of being in the same tournament with golf 's big names . <P> Last week the dew sweepers had the week off while the Big 20 played in an invitation tourney at Miami . Some of them , sadder &; wiser , have gone home . Others , looking at thinning wallets decided to stay and try out just one more tournament , at Jacksonville this week . Among them : onetime Tennis Champ Ellsworth Vines , who gave up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said was more challenging and less monotonous . His low-70 golf puts him on the outer fringes of the Big 20 . A year ago he set aside $15,000 to make himself a pro champ . Said he last week : " At present prices , my $15,000 wo n't last me a year . "
