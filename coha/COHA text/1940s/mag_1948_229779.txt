The army of Israel was fighting the Amalekites , and the going was hard . On a hill above the battle stood old Moses himself . And it came to pass , when Moses held up his hand , that Israel prevailed : and when he let down his hand , Amalek prevailed . But Moses ' hands were heavy . . . and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands , the one on the one side and the other on the other side ; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. * The Israelites won . <P> The good work done by Aaron and Hur that day should be an inspiration to U.S. laymen . So thought greying , conscientious Principal Harold Dressel of the Northrup Elementary School at River Rouge , Mich . When the new pastor of his church complained of the indifference of laymen in the congregations he had known , Methodist Dressel remembered Moses ' helpers . <P> He began a mail campaign to his friends urging them to join a new secret society- " the Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meetings or committees . Members are asked to look up the 17th chapter of Exodus , then do their best to play Aaron and Hur to their minister , rabbi , priest-or even doctor , teacher or friend . " It may be only a sincere word of commendation or an offer to help in a tight spot . When you have done this twice yourself , you may nominate another person for membership . Write your nominee . . . and always remember that Jesus said : ' Take heed that ye do not your alms before men . ' " <P> * Exodus 17 : 11 , 12.
