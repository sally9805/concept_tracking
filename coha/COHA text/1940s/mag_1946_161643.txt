Henceforth the Royal Family will enjoy the blessings of trade unionism right in their own home ; Buckingham Palace has been organized . Two hundred and fifty-six of the 260 royal domestics have joined the Civil Servants Union , which is now negotiating with the Trades Union Congress for affiliation . In collective bargaining with His Majesty 's servants , Sir Ulick Alexander , the Keeper of the Privy Purse , and Sir Piers Legh , the Master of the King 's Household , will represent the King . <P> At the moment , the servants are bargaining for a 48-hour week ( before the war they worked every other day , but the wartime servant shortage changed that ; on occasions of state , they are often obliged to work until midnight ) . Robert Anderson , Deputy General Secretary of the C.S.U. , has already obtained an average 27-shilling ( $5.50 ) - a- week raise for the recruits . There is no closed-shop talk at the Palace , but the C.S.U . says it will go all out to capture the four rugged individualists who have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castle , St. James 's Palace and Marlborough House ( Queen Mary 's residence ) will also be organized . Sandringham and Balmoral are personal residences , so the servants there do not come under the head of civil servants . <P> Future problems between the new unionists and the King 's Household will be discussed under the chairmanship of one of the blue-coated ( senior ) servants of the household , as distinguished from the red-coated ( junior ) servants . The union has also joined up with the London Trades Council , and one of the King 's footmen has been selected as the delegate to the L.T.C. <P> The Palace has given the union an office for meetings . There the footmen , butlers , housemaids , valets , cooks , pages and workers at the Royal Mews can take their gripes , if they have any . However , an aura of bliss seems to have settled over the Royal menage . Wrote J. R. Clynes , former Home Secretary , in the Municipal and General Workers Journal : " In an enlightened future the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attaching to his place of employment but the honor of acting as shop steward for his mates .
