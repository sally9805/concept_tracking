A new job was created to bring together all the Marine divisions for the final assaults against Japan . Last week Admiral Nimitz announced that tough , kindly Lieut . General Holland M. Smith had been given command of Fleet Marine Forces of the Pacific . <P> Probably it meant more administration work than field command for " Howlin ' Mad " Smith . But he could take it . With Tarawa , Kwajalein , Eniwetok and Saipan behind him , he had commanded more amphibious assaults than any other U.S. general in World War II .
