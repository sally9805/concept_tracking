Everyone remembered that he had been the first U.S. flyer to tie Eddie Rickenbacker 's World War I record by shooting down 26 Japs over Guadalcanal . In 1948 , Minnehaha County elected him overwhelmingly to the state house of representatives . <P> Soon Joe Foss , who had left the Marines to become a lieutenant colonel in the Air National Guard , was flying all over the state acting as master of ceremonies for South Dakota 's Miss America contest , dedicating baseball fields and leading airmen in a fancy repertoire of acrobatics .

" <P> Last week , at 34 , Joe Foss made up his mind . " Just say I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1950 primary , " he told a newsman . Since Republican Governor George T. Mickelson could not , by law , succeed himself , Joe Foss obviously thought his political skies were CAVU-ceiling and visibility unlimited .
