txt Russia 's squeeze on this city is beginning to pinch  --  hard . " So far we are getting rations , " says a west Berlin housewife . " but how long will it last ? " Her question really meant : How long will American and British cargo planes attempt to bridge the Russian blockade of this isolated city ? To Germans . the issue is gravely in doubt . Lots of Berliners believe the western Allies sincerely mean to stay here , but they fear the high cost of living by aerial supply will discourage them in the end . " l'ou or Us ? " One skeptical German looking at planes constantly overhead inquires : " Incidentally . who is paying  --  you or us ? " If the city of Berlin were being charged airfreight rates for food it would be an insupportable burden . The fact . Russian propaganda notwithstanding , is that if there is any charge upon the Germans it will not exceed rail or water rates . The American taxpayer is footing the difference for the United States ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The Army does n't say and guesses are hazardous . If you tried to figure on a commercial basis the cost might run as high as $200.000 a day . But the Army says you ca n't figure that way . It argues the planes are owned by the government anyway ; the people who pilot and maintain them are already in service . So they maintain the extra expense of " Operation Vittles " is mostly in terms of the gasoline consumed above what would be used in routine Sights . As nearly as can be estimated without any official confirmation , total gas consumption might cost between $20,000 and 125.000 daily . So much f-. ? the cost in dollars . The fee in American lives got its first entry Thursday night when a U. S. plane flying food to Berlin crashed near Frankfurt . killing three . The average Berliner is concentrating en personal problems created by life in a oesieged city  --  and on the idea of what life will be like if the western powers pull out . One policeman in the American sector says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if they do , " he adds melodramatically , " I 'll shoot my wife and kid and then myself . " The Strain Grow% There 's no question things are getting tough . Electricity cuts will give the ordinary German household only four hours of power out of 24  --  and two of those will probably be after midnight . Warnings have been issued to save water . Street lighting is cut 75% . Some transport lines are cut out and the subways and street cars of western Berlin stop running at 6 o'clock in the evening . Robberies are already increasing . It 's like a return of the nightmarish days of 1945 when Berlin was a dead , impenetrably dark Jungle . One housewife says : " With an electric kitchen I have to do my whole day 's cooking the day before  --  and that during a couple of hours , not knowing from one minute to the next what time the power is coming on . " In this northern latitude it does n't get dark in summer until about 10:30 p.m. so lighting is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate except at some crazy time like 11:45 at night , whenever there is power , unless they have stand-by diesel generators . There 's a year 's supply of diesel oil here . " I do n't mind so much for myself and the family , " says a west Berlin woman . " We usually go to bed about 10 o'clock and do n't have any money for movies . It 's people getting laid off I 'm thinking about . " The western sectors of Berlin must try to get along on 100,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a day . That 's considerably less than half the power consumed Just by the elevated train in these sectors before the western military governments decided they would have to cut it off their supply . ( The Russians , heartily patting themselves on the back , said they 'd supply the elevated with power . ) Many Firms Close Three hundred firms in one district of the British sector have asked permission to close . A tiny stocking repair firm in the American sector was among those shut down overnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its 2() working girls were sent home . Industry in the French sector is almost completely at a standstill ; one tire repair company is being allowed to ihm full blast to service essential vehicles of all three Allied sectors . Of some 1,200 industrial establishments in the American sector only nine essential ones will continue to function on anything like a full scale . Four of these are medical product manufacturers , and these must cut out sidelines like cosmetics . In the middle of a workday afternoon , the cavernous shops of the Fritz Werner Machine Tools Co. in the American sector resemble a huge tomb . An official explains : " Our people are working staggered hours so we can get maximum use of what current is available . One day they come in at 6:30 in the morning and work until 2 o'clock in the afternoon . Next day they come in at 2 in the afternoon and work until 9 p. m . " How long even that can continue he has no idea . Since the beginning of the blockade the firm has been running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 25% is cut away . " But it is n't only electricity , " the factory executive hastens to add . " Our raw materials ? pig iron , steel , coal  --  came mostly from western Germany . With the blockade our stocks are about finished . Worse than that . we have no money to pay our workers " Ca n't Ship Goode " Seventy per cent of our production went to western Germany . ' he explains . " Since the blockade we have n't been able to ship anything except that in the last couple of days we have been putting a little hit on Army cargo planes going bii.ek after dying food into Berlin . Even at best I do n't see how we could get more than a small percentage of our normal shipments out  --  even assuming we could continue producing . " The American authorities want me to keep my workers during the electricity crisis . I want to keep them , too : there 's plenty of reconstruction to do here . But I ca n't keep them if I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off their workers . The Ruess Co .. makers of scientific instruments , have had to let at least half of their employes go . Those entitled to paid %acations are getting them . The others are urged to take temporary work elsewhere . but as the Rucss director says , " If they can get any work better than rubble clearing . I 'd like to know where . " Everybody 'S in the same boat . and it is capsizing . The enormous financial loss Berlin firms are suffering is almost obscured by the total choas of the situation . Management has little choice but to take it philosophically . Says an executive of Opta Radio : " If it 's a question of a few weeks we can stand the loss . If it 's going on indefinitely it does n't matter whether we can stand it or not . " Labor unrest is growing . Communist cells in all factories are busy as bees spreading discontent . They point nut that in the Soviet sector of the city firms are n't laying off workers . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communists out of TOO workers . " Most of the employes know we 're doing everything we can and seem to understand the situation , " one comments . " But that 's this week . I wo n't vouch for next week . " Morale Is High Morale throughout the Allied area of the city so far seems surprisingly high . A university student may have the explanation : " After all , Berliners have seen their city and their souls fought for for three years . We 've been hardened as few others have been in the art of dissecting propaganda . The Russians can yell all they want about the air-bridge not helping Berliners  --  that it 's lust an excuse to cover Allied plundering of Berlin  - -  but even a moron in the western sector knows his food ration has n't been cut . " How much can the air-bridge accomplish ? That it can haul in food in good flying weather has been demonstrated . Now it is bringing coal as well  --  though officials estimate Its maximum capacity at 2.000 tons daily and Berlin 's utilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintains the air-bridge can keep industry going .
