The era of blood and tears and anger had ended . Sooner than any other people who had felt German bombs , Britons felt pity for the defeated enemy . Last week a united House of Commons protested hotly against the continuation of Germany 's misery-and against the chaos into which a destitute Germany would drag Europe . <P> " Shame ! Shame ! " There was passionate talk of starving German children , of unnecessarily cruel treatment , of the " greatest catastrophe the human race ever experienced . " Cried Labor 's Michael Foot : " We are protesting against the wanton and deliberate creation of a new sore in Europe . " Charged Independent Sir Arthur Salter : " If . . . millions during this winter freeze and starve , this will not have been the inevitable consequences of war . " The implication was that Russia , Poland and Czechoslovakia were deliberately creating chaos in Germany . One M.P . accused the U.S. of the same " lunatic policy . " <P> Some suggested that Britain send food from her own scarce stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hungry neighbors , said that he did not care " two rows of pins " what happened to German men , women &; children . Tories and Laborites alike shouted : " Shame ! Shame ! " <P> Then Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin hulked to his feet . Said he : " I wish there were similar parliaments . . . and free and unfettered discussion of this problem in other countries in Europe . . . . There are two kinds of hunger in Europe today . One is physical . . . . But I sometimes think that the awful blackout over Europe is creating a great spiritual hunger . ... " <P> He predicted that UNRRA , whose task it was to abate Europe 's hunger , would face disaster within a few weeks unless the U.S. speeded up its support of UNRRA . Britain was already pledged to pay proportionately as much as the U.S. <P> Price of Stupidity . Bevin for the first time openly regretted that Germany had been split into occupation zones , in effect admitted that the system was not working : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop zones . . . . Probably . . . it would have been better if we had not done it . " He reported that some 15 million German " displaced persons " were being chivied back &; forth across Europe ; that some ten million Frenchmen , Italians and others were also waiting to go home . Telling of how he watched the misery-laden procession of refugees in Berlin , he said : " I felt , my God , that is the price of man 's stupidity . ... It was the most awful sight . . . . " <P> This generous outburst , a credit to British decency , swept Bevin and others of like mind into one historical error . When Bevin said of the Sudeten Germans and the Czechs that they " had lived together in perfect harmony until Hitler 's stooges and agents broke up their democratic state , " he was falling back on the old , dubious view that Hitler 's ' New Order had been the work of only a few Nazi gangsters . The 3,000,000 Sudeten Germans , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mass to betray the Czechs .
