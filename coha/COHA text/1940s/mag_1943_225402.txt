When I dip into the future , jar as human eye can see , . <P> I behold a world as selfish , just as selfish as can be . . . . <P> With this squint-eyed rewrite of Tennyson , rabble-rousing Senator Gerald P. Nye last week keynoted the New Isolationism . <P> Until last week , Gerald Nye had not harangued a big isolationist audience with a big isolationist speech since the afternoon of Dec. 7 , 1941 , in Pittsburgh , when he sweatily , stubbornly refused for hours to believe that the Japs had really attacked Pearl Harbor . <P> All the old , familiar America-Firstish faces were there in the Mural Room of Chicago 's Hotel Morrison : the furtive , snickering little women who pass around anti-Semitic postcards ; the Coughlinites ; the pinch-lipped , waspish old couples with gleaming eyes ; the Patrick Henry Forumites ; the overcorseted We the Mothers ; the fanatical ragtag &; bobtail of a 100% star-spangled movement . <P> There was the handsome ex-Yorkville Jew-baiter , Joe McWilliams , resplendent in a red-white- &-blue; necktie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now the self-appointed leader of the bonus army of World War II . ( He is agitating for a $7,800 government bonus for every World War II veteran . ) His new backer , blonde , young , black-gowned Socialite Mrs. Alexis de Tarnowsky , accompanied him . Altogether , there were more than 1,000 of them ( the Chicago Tribune puffed it to 2,000 ) . <P> Each time Gerald Nye belittled United Nations strategy , postwar planning , Roosevelt , Willkie , Churchill , Stalin , or Chiang Kaishek , the catcalls and clapping rocked the chandeliers , quivered against the black-and-jade glass murals . <P> Nye wanted to " win this war . . . quickly . . . and with as little cost in lives as is possible . " But it seemed to him that an equally urgent job was " completely overwhelming and smothering the **26;9951;TOOLONG Foundation kind of leadership . " He proposed action : " Let us abandon silence . . . use such weapons as are at our command . . . and strike down this thing . " <P> Billed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a GOPster as libelous ) , the meeting was engineered by smooth , stocky Chicago lawyer William J. Grace , chairman of an organization now called the Citizens ' U.S.A. Committee ( formerly the Citizens ' Keep America Out of War Committee ) . But Illinois ' top-drawer Republicans , although mainly anti-Willkie , shunned the Mural Room , looked prim and pained . The Great Revival was off to a weak start .
