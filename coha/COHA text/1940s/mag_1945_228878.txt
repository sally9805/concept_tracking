In the new age that is just beginning the news of Science will loom larger than ever in our lives-so this week meet Dr. Gerald Wendt , the full-time technical adviser of the writers and researchers of our Science news . <P> A colorful figure he is , too-a stocky , slightly-balding man with a Mephistophelean mustache and imperial ( he offered to shave the whiskers off when he came to TIME if we thought them less in keeping with his new career as a journalist than they had been in his former calling as Dean of the School of Chemistry and Physics at Pennsylvania State College ) . <P> Twenty years ago he himself made headline news with his own experiments with atomic power , and The Literary Digest carried a long report on how Dr. Wendt had released atomic energy by bombarding tungsten in a vacuum tube at a temperature six times as hot as the sun and transmuting some of the tungsten into helium . <P> Dr. Wendt had printer 's ink in his veins long before he came to TIME , for he put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working as a reporter on the Davenport , Iowa , Democrat . <P> Since then he has been a captain in the Chemical Warfare Service during World War I , a chemist in the U.S. Bureau of Mines ( where he helped develop a new way to extract radium ) , research director of both Standard Oil of Indiana and General Printing Ink Corporation , a professor at the University of Chicago , dean at Penn State , and Director of Science and Education for the New York World 's Fair . <P> But all those years he was also busy writing and editing-Matter and Energy , Science for the World of Tomorrow and a six-volume series of textbooks on The Sciences . <P> TIME 'S Science Consultant has a comfortable home in Connecticut , but he seldom gets to see it ; when he came to work for us he rented an apartment two blocks from our offices so our researchers and writers could always get in touch with him . Its walls are lined with yards of scientific books and papers , and its closets are packed less with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , steaks and biscuits made from yeast , three-dimensional photographs in full color , a portable cosmic ray detector , portraits painted in fluorescent paints that can be seen only in the dark . ( One of his prized possessions is a Krazy Kat cartoon - " Why is somebody always trying to smash the poor I 'll adam ? " ) <P> A steady stream of cables , wires , newspaper clippings , press releases and trade journals pours across his desk , and he reads them all for leads for TIME stories . But Wendt is no armchair journalist : he spends some six months of every year piling up as many as 92,000 miles visiting the government , industrial and college laboratories he likes to call " the birthplace of the future . " <P> This week , for example , finds him at the Boeing Aircraft plant in Seattle - off on the first leg of a journey that will carry him to science centers in every state . <P> <P> Cordially ,               @ @ @ @ @ @
