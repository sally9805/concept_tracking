Over 85,000 workers were on strike , chiefly against the War Labor Board , during parts of last week . In Detroit 25,000 men struck six major plants for three days because of delays by WLB in hearing their grievances . In Akron 40,000 rubber workers stopped work when WLB granted them only a 3-an-hour pay rise instead of an expected 8 rise . Many a union , apparently , was discovering that Government is just as tough a taskmaster as private industry . Others were following the lead of John L. Lewis : strike down WLB or any other agency that refuses wage rises .
