For Seventh Air Force flyers and ground crews at a new base in the Marianas , it was the first payday in months . They had the works to shoot . But this was the situation : <P> Movies : free , when available . <P> Cigarets : a pack a day , issued free . <P> Beer : none . <P> Haircuts , shaves , shines : self-service only . <P> Travel : for air crews , too much of it-all strictly business ; for ground crews , no place to go , no way to get there , no time for it anyway . <P> The A.P.O. did a land-office business , nearly ran out of money-order blanks .
