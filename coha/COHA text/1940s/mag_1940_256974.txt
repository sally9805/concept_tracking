Can a riderless horse jump higher than a man ? To try to settle this footling argument , Manhattan 's Metropolitan Equestrian Club last week invited five A. A. U. athletes to compete against 14 show-ring jumpers . With riders to " lift " them , horses have been known to jump almost 9 ft. high . Bareback , few have ever equaled . man 's best high-jumping record : 6 ft. 9 in . Last week 's contest was a washout . Horse 's highest jump : 6 ft. 2 in . Man 's highest jump : 6 ft. 2 in.
