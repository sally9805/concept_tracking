box house and the alley ; the latter a narrow street without sunlightor sanitation cutting through the serried residences of the rich . Like decayed meat between thick slices of good bread , the alleys of Philadelphia bred disease at the very back doors of the godly . But they were profitable and " picturesque , " etchers liked to draw them , and they were also convenient ; the sons of the godly could slip around the corner almost anywhere and within a block or so find a brothel . South , east and north the alleys spread , until half of Philadelphia became alleys , which it still is . On hot nights Philadelphia stinks of its alleys and from the very beginning it had the most corrupt and inefficient government in the country . In 1849 the Journal of the Select Council described among scores of similar places , Cherry Court , where there were twelve houses occupied by sixteen families , or sixty persons , and every privy leaked into a cellar , and one privy had not been cleaned in thirty-five years . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet wide . The Select Council advised the sprinkling of chloride of lime . Three of the Cherry Court houses are still standing . In 1938 Philadelphia had over 70,000 sub-standard houses , 17 , - 000 of which were unfit for human habitation , 21,000 in need of major repairs , and 1o,000 actually unsafe . In 1936 two houses collapsed and killed seven people . The Federal Housing Commission , viewing Philadelphia , threw up its hands in despair and began to build its model apartment houses and dwellings on the outskirts of the city . To such a pass had Penn 's " greene countrie towne " come within the space of two hundred and fifty years . Starting as a dream , it had had everything and lost everything but the worst slums in Christendom save those of Glasgow and London . Topping the phallic tower of Philadelphia 's city hall . . . the disguised and over-decorated phallus of the eighties . . . is a gigantic statue of William Penn . His outstretched hand points to the red-light district of the city . Felix had caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had left the steamer a special delivery from Mr. Wilde had been handed him . Mr. Wilde asked Felix to call at his office the next afternoon , and then had gone on to say that the Cassianut Street house was ready . Felix could go there direct from the sta-P201tion . He would find Mrs. Ross , his uncle 's housekeeper and cook , still in charge , and the house had been thoroughly cleaned from top to bottom . For a moment Mr. Wilde had become almost alarmingly personal : " I trust , " he had concluded , " you will find things to your liking . " Felix had read for a while on the train and then had slept , and then presently his time-sense had told him he was nearing his destination and he had sat up in his chair and looked out of the window . The train was crossing a bridge and above him , on the Schuylkill , an eight-oared shell was coming downstream , the blades of its sweeps catching the sun for an instant and then losing it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whirring fan . On either side white water plumed like ostrich feathers . Behind the shell was a launch with a man , a tiny figure , standing up in the bow , a megaphone to his lips , and the shining placid reaches of the little river were bright green along their shores where willows were beginning to put out , and were dotted here and there with canoes and single spiders . To the left , below the bridge , were the towers of Philadelphia , blue-gray in the April dusk , and even the tower of City Hall was beautiful . Felix 's heart stirred , and then was quiet , and then stirred again . The train had started to slide around a curve and a wrought-iron gate and two little brick houses had come into view , and a circular gilt sign over the gate that read " Zoological Gardens . " Presently behind high iron-paled fences , and fenced outdoor runs , were the quaintly monstrous shapes of hartebeests and elands and various other South African antelope . They did not raise their heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sunlight slanted in through the train window . Time is nothing . In moments of reality , it never is , thought Felix . Memory is strange magic , and takes no account of the present . Indeed , it is difficult to say just what the present is , or whether man actually exists in it when the strange magic of memory sets itself to work . Felix smelled an April that had been gone for twenty-six years and felt its mild and watery sun , and saw , standing beside him , a tall dark young man with a thin face and smiling gray eyes . The tall young man was looking down at him . " Excited , son ? " he was saying . " So , am I. Sorry I did n't know about this . " Felix had not seen the Schuylkill by day since he was nine . He had gone through Philadelphia many times , of course , on his way to and from North Carolina to New York , but always at night , and the place had been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the blackness like the fortresses of condottiere , and flashing electric signs , and a long twinkling street or two , apparentlyleading nowhere , blurred by the lights of moving cars . At a couple of stations the train had stopped and strangers had got off and handed their bags to porters , on their faces the look of having arrived that always annoys a little the traveller who has farther to go . But this is lovely , thought Felix . What had people been talking about ? This was one of the loveliest approaches to a city there was  --  this first glimpse of Philadelphia down the shining reaches of the Schuylkill ; the second as the train drew nearer to Thirtieth Street Station . The Schuylkill was visible again , and off to the left were boathouses , and a long and shining weir over which the river poured in quicksilver cascade , and by the weir was a small stuccocolumnedyellow pavilion , and on a little hill above the weir and pavilion , a great rose-brown Greek temple glimmered in the sinkingsun . To one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fairmount Park . But this must be a good city , thought Felix , or otherwise people would not do such things . The train leaving Thirtieth Street had crossed another bridge on its way to its final destination , and abruptly incredible ugliness , drab , dejected and unbroken , took over . To the right , sightless warehouses shut off the view , and to the left you looked down upon eight blocks  --  and Philadelphia blocks are long  --  of shabby and dispirited houses . Felix descended from his car to one of the long narrow openairplatforms of Broad Street Station where James Peace caught up with him , and together , followed by porters , they sought a taxicab . Broad Street Station had not changed . Felix remembered it . As he walked along the open train shed and across the waiting place beyond , open toward the trains , he wondered if the pigeons that fluttered above the gates and nested in the high grimy cornices , were the same pigeons he had seen as a boy . Their descendants ,  |p203anyway  . He and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide and dirty stairs and pushed open swing doors and came to the tunnel Fifteenth Street makes as it runs between Market and Filbert underneath the station . Here yellow taxicabs were waiting . The tunnel smelled of dampness and mud and lack of sunlight . Felix raised his head sharply and sniffed through his short nose . That was a typical Philadelphia smell . Tunnels in New York smelled dry and breathless and as if on the edge of pneumonia , but this was a thick wet careless smell , inefficient and human and nostalgic . He and James Peace stowed themselves in a taxicab , their bags piled about them . " Twelve hundred and five Cassianut Street , please , " said Felix , and then sat bolt upright and opened his eyes wide behind his glasses . Good gracious ! . . . Felix 's mouth was a little open . This was the first time he had realized that 1205 Cassianut Street actuallybelonged to him  --  to him the son of " the le-lopers. "  |p204UNLIKE  Felix , Mavis had spent no time in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by eleven-thirty was in her studio in one of those small and charming side streets which distinguish a city that almost everywhere else , with a certain insolent carelessness , has permitted the destruction of its beauty and charm . From the grimy and crowded decay of midtown Walnut Street you turn an abrupt corner into a narrow channel that runs for three blocks north and south , and all at once you become a slowwalkingand thoughtful citizen . On warm days this is particularly so for the narrow channel is filled with sunshine and no one walks there save on business , and the business for the most part has to do with going to one of the small clubs tucked away in the suddenquiet  --  newspaper clubs , etchers clubs , painters clubs  --  or else to one of the studio buildings or low-ceilinged restaurants . The clubs and restaurants occupy two-story miniature old houses of brick and have such rakish Greenwich Village names as " The Smuggler 's Cave , " " The Coin D'Argent , " and so on ; the studio buildings have extra stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uneven narrow brick sidewalks small upended iron drain pipes of an earlier day are imbedded slantingly in the curbs separatingthe sidewalks from the not much broader lane , in order to prevent pedestrians from being run down by carriages . Mavis 's studio was in the third story back of a slim brick buildingand consisted of a room with a big north light , a tiny bedroom , a bath , and a kitchenette . You went up dark and narrow stairs and when you opened the door into the studio you were surprised by the airiness and light . The east window of the studio looked down on two back yards separated from each other by a high and grimy wooden wall . The back yard of Mavis 's buildingp205was neglected , but in the other , some one  --  a painter probably  --  had planted a couple of defiant young trees , slim and impudent as tenement girls . There was also a small round bed of straggling flowers in the center of the back yard , set in a scrawny plot of grass at one corner of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city there were only English sparrows and their even lower-class English cousins , starlings . The sparrows bathed occasionally and made an exhibitionistic noise when they did so ; the starlings in their dark and sinister minds showed a contempt for water as they did for everything else pleasant and hygienic . Mavis opened the door of the studio with her latchkey . " You can put the bags in the bedroom , " she said to the taxicab driver who had followed her , and went to the back window and opened it . The place had the airless unused smell of unoccupied rooms . Mavis foresaw a full day of scrubbing and dusting , but she looked forward to it . Dust may be an enemy of health but it has always been the friend of restless women . Mavis paid off the taxicab driver and went back to the window and leaned on the sill , staring down into the garden with the birdbath . The sight of her own country , her own town , her own rooms , had made her feel calmer and more reflective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over on the train she had said to herself : What kind of a fool have you been trying to make of yourself , my good woman ? She had had an unpleasant vision of a tall darkhairedgirl moodily sipping highball after highball in the corner of the smoking room of the Abruzzi . A man in a dirty smock , smoking a cigarette , and with tousled iron-gray hair , had come out into the garden where the birdbath was , and had stood for a moment looking up at the sky . Then he had walked up and down somberly , and then , as if a surprising determination had overtaken him , had turned and run back into the house . Mavis had laughed suddenly . They do have a wonderful time , she thought . They really do . They are never bored , and are never just dull . They are often miserable ; they are frequently desperate , they are usually irritable , but they do have a wonderful time . She was thinking of artists  --  all kinds of artists . They were lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , was the secret  --  always to be excited . She wondered why she was thinking of artists so objectively . Was n't she one herself ? Or had been  --  or at least wanted to be . Certainly she was an artist ; that is , in her attitude toward life . Mavis 's delicate jaw became determined as she stared down at the birdbath . And she would remain an artist in her attitude toward life no matter what she did . It had been this sense of excitement that had taken her out of Harrisburg ; it had been this sense of excitement that had made her turn to color and form to achieve some degree of release and articulateness . And it was also this sense of excitementthat sent her whirling down into black despair when people or events , when expectations , as they so often did , failed to live up to what she expected , especially when , in addition to this , they were unnecessarily and unexplainably dull , or ugly , or cruel , or unnecessarilystupid . But by the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Mavis could remember night after night when life had seemed unbearable  --  when she did n't see how she could stand it much longer  --  and then how the next morning she would be stirred and elated , warm and ready for anything , merely because there was a mist above roofs and cornices , or a cat creeping around chimneypots , or snow delicately and aloofly falling . Ever since she had been a little girl , whenever she had been interested in some undertaking , she had tried to sleep fast so that she would awaken early to what she was doing . She stepped back from the window and began to unpack . It 's been my own fault , she said to herself . I 've stuck my chin out . In the very beginning I stuck my chin out . I could have stayed in Harrisburg and remained what I was and married , and by now have had a couple of babies . But I did n't , and so here I am . And I stuck my chin out when I fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ' a snob and a Philadelphian . All right , I 'll continue to stick my chin out whenever it seems a good thing to do , and I 'll continue to take punishment . It seemed to Mavis that the lowest and dullest of all attitudes , the stupidest , was not to stick your chin out . Frogs did not stick their chins out ; they had no chins to stick . On the first floor of Mavis 's studio building was a little restaurantcalled for some unknown reason " The Ecrevisse , " since itp207never by any chance served sea food . " The Ecrevisse " was run by a widow , a Mrs. Simmons , and her twenty-year-old daughter , Millicent . The food was good and cheap , but it had about it the vagueness that food planned and cooked by women for women usually has . Every now and then a male painter or musician strayed into " The Ecrevisse " and there was undue animation . Millicent had undeveloped yearnings toward being a painter herself , but she was n't sure ; there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she had no other place to go , Mavis ate at " The Ecrevisse . " Somewhere Millicent and Mrs. Simmons had collected a number of American railway posters and had glazed them and pinned them up on the walls , and then had painted the woodwork of the small room blue . The general effect was pleasing to them . It gave them the sense of being in Paris and yet safely at home in Philadelphia . The railway posters were the United States at their best and cleanest , their most bronzed and long-limbed . They were of American girls in ski-pants at Sun Valley and of equally longlimbedlovely American girls in skin-tight white-jersey bathing suits at Palm Beach and other seaside resorts . There was not a mother amongst them . At one o'clock Mavis went downstairs to " The Ecrevisse " for luncheon . Mrs. Simmons and Millicent greeted her with mouselike cries of joy ; Millicent , it seemed , had had a very exciting month . She had met a radio announcer who had talked of getting her to broadcast some morning  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can Do " program ; a local program which for fifteen minutes daily at ten A.M. interrupted housewives at their tasks and filled them with rebellious thoughts . " He 's terribly good looking , " murmured Millicent . " Who ? " " John Donahue . He 's with XZD . " Millicent was going to broadcast on how she and her mother ran " The Ecrevisse . " Mavis was momentarily depressed by the mixed motives of most of her sex and their easy victimization . The good looks of John Donahue had nothing to do with successful broadcasting and Millicenthad the anonymous face and the decided figure that leads more to seduction than success.  | " We 've had a real good month since you 've been away , " said Mrs. Simmons . " A hundred more meals served than the month before , and six new regulars . " Mavis was further depressed  --  and impressed  --  by the way you can be away for years engaged in the most exotic of enterprises and upon your return find not the slightest interest in what you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misbehavior . What a shock Marco Polo must have had , she thought . Nothing could have been farther from the dark fascinationof Haiti than " The Ecrevisse . " " I 've had to hire another waitress , " continued Mrs. Simmons . " Oh , good afternoon , Miss Wilde . " A thin dark girl with a high color and restless eyes had come in and sat down at a table next to Mavis . She was wearing a tweed skirt and an orange-colored sweater . " Wo n't you sit over here ? " asked Mavis . The thin girl hesitated and looked shy and then accepted . " Why  --  thank you . " The sweater and the severe skirt emphasized the sharpness of her breasts and the curves of her hips . What the French call " a false-thin , " thought Mavis . " Working hard ? " she inquired . " Oh , about the same as usual . Where have you been ? You 've been away , have n't you ? " " Haiti , " said Mavis . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Are we still interferingwith everybody 's life down there ? That 's one of our favorite hunting grounds , is n't it ? " Mavis 's eyes narrowed . " It depends upon what you read , " she said . She shook her head . " No  --  we got out the day we said we would and now things are becomingincreasingly normal  --  the roads the Marines built are all going to pieces , mosquitoes are coming back , and there 's a trace of black-water fever again , also yaws . . . . No , everything 's all right . Going back to normal . Almost as efficient as Russia . " The thin girl flushed . " I 've never been to Haiti , " she said . " I only know what I hear . " Mavis put her fork into her chicken a la King , garnished more prettily than it tasted.  | " Why do you people always talk to the same people , " she asked , " and read the same reviews ? Why do n't you occasionally talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , listen ? " She interrupted herself and smiled . " Sorry , " she said . " I did n't mean to be rude , but I 've been in Haiti , and I 've just got back , and I do n't know why nowadaysit 's so fashionable to believe everything that 's bad about your own country . Have n't we ever done anything fine or courageous or fairly unselfish ? I suppose , of course , you know why the Marines went there . " " More or less , " said the thin girl . " A revolution , was n't it ? " She was watching Mavis intently , an uncertain smile on her lips . She 's both bold and timid , thought Mavis . " Yes , " she said drily , " quite a revolution . The people of Portau-Princehad just torn their president , Guillaume Sam , to pieces  --  literally I mean , with their hands  --  and if we had n't gone in , Germany or France would have . " She wondered why it was Americans could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always in one gutter or the other . Until a few years before , America had never done anything wrong ; now it could do nothing right . " You 're very patriotic , are n't you ? " murmured the thin girl , her uncertain smile widening . " No , " said Mavis , " I hate patriotism , but I like decent pride . " Suddenly the thin girl smiled in a friendly and disarming fashion . " I 'm giving a party the first Saturday night in June , a little over three weeks from now , " she said , " at The Buccaneer 's Rest  --  you know , that little place two blocks away ? Near Pine Street ? It 's for Sharpe Wyatt the English painter . He 's finished those murals he 's been doing for Dornenbery 's and is sailing home . Nine o'clock . You can wear a costume or not . Will you come ? " Mavis wished that so often , just as you were getting angry with somebody , he or she would n't turn around and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in question had a disarming and suddenly humble smile . She had wanted to say bitingly , " Yes , I 'll come as a patriot , " but of course she could n't say that . " Thanks , " she said . " I 'd like to  --  Sharpe Wyatt  --  I 've heard of him . "  | " He 's terribly clever , so much more clever than most painters , " said the thin girl . " Most of them never read and do n't seem to care about anything , but he 's up on everything  --  his murals are like Diego Rivera 's . They mean something . " " That 's what they tell me , " said Mavis . She paid her bill and stood up . " But I 'll see you before then , " said the thin girl . " Come into the studio any time . . . . I 'm almost always there at five . A lot of people drop in for drinks . I 'd like to show you what I 'm doing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , only I ca n't show you anything I 'm doing . " Her words were clipped . " I 've quit painting . " The thin girl expressed dismay . " Given up painting ? Why , I thought you were just beginning to do so well . " Mavis paused in the doorway . " I 'm going to take a job , " she said . " A big one this time-I think people kid themselves a lot about this art stuff . It 's the line of least resistance . " She went slowly up the narrow stairs to her studio . Those who had everything in the world and did nothing with it made her sick . This girl Harriet Wilde for instance had everything . She would even be pretty if she was n't so sullen and self-conscious . And instead of rejoicing and making the most of her opportunities , she carved monstrosities out of wood and talked about a revolution in which she would be among the first to be shot . It takes guts , thought Mavis , to engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guts to that extent , you do n't bother about revolutions , but fight life as it is and try to improve it . That is , you do wherever improvementis possible . Most of the young revolutionists who haunted St. John 's Street and its environs , and the other St. John 's Streets of the world , and who now were filling the papers with their meetings and isms , calling themselves " The Youth This , " and " The Youth That , " were neither artists nor revolutionists , in Mavis 's opinion . They merely hated something ; often themselves . " Short-Cut-ists , " thought Mavis . They want everything quickly and on a silver plate ; and the ones who 've been born with a silver plate like this Wilde girl , and know how little it amounts to , do n't want to work to make the silver plate useful , but want to achievep211a sense of importance by despising what the others have n't got . Turn her about and she 'd want the opposite . Mavis opened the door to her apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to work to be powerful . I 'm going to be somebody . Everything else will be secondary . And then I 'll be amused by people like Harriet Wilde , instead of angry , and then men like Henry Armstead will want to marry me but ca n't . I 'll be beautifully gowned , she thought , in black velvet preferably . She saw her face unmoved in its careful make-up , a mask of perfection ; very worldly , amused only by the exceptional . She crossed the room to the telephone and sitting down , called a number . The disembodied politeness of central gave way to the disembodied politeness of a second operator . " Hargood and Satterwhite . " " Can I speak to Mr. Saylor , please . " " Just a moment , please . Who 's this ? " " Miss Mavis Spate . " " Yes  --  just a moment , please . " A man 's voice , throaty and guttural , cut in . " Mr. Saylor ? " " Yes . " " Mr. Saylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm just back  --  this very moment-from Haiti . How about that job you said you had for me ? Have you got it ? " Mr. Saylor chuckled . " Do n't be so breathless  --  you mean that one on that nasty magazinewith my cousin ? " " Yes . " " Well , I do n't think that 's polite . It is n't a nasty magazine  --  it 's profitable . Nothing is nasty that 's profitable . He 's got two now  --  he 's got a new one called Strip that 's coming out next month . They say it 's a humdinger . Gypsy Rose Lee is doing the woman 's page ; Ann Corio , the fashions . The motto  --  the staff , they call it , do n't they , or banner , is the less you put on , the sooner you take off . ' Quite a paper . " He was enjoying himself . " Please , " said Mavis . " Please , I 'm serious . I 've got to have a job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still teasing her.  | " I thought you disapproved of magazines like Peek and this new one , " he said . " You told me you were an artist and respected the human body too much . That was the last time I saw you . You said Mavis interrupted him again . " Shut up , " she said . " You 're a rat . I do n't care what it is , so long as it gives me a chance  --  a good salary , an opportunity . I 'm hard , Mr. Saylor . I 'm a woman of the world , now . To hell with morals . " His voice immediately became grave , concerned . " Tut ! Tut ! You 're joking of course , but still  --  Sorry , kid , I did n't mean to tease you . And do n't bother . . . . Yes , I 've got a job for you , and it 's just the kind you 'll like and do well at . I 've been keeping it warm for you , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a secret . This same cousin of mine  --  this Benjamin Disola , you see  --  he , and his partner and angel  --  are going to start a different kind of magazine . One you 'll be proud of . And they 're looking for a person just like you . Disola 's seen your drawings and likes ' em . I 'll make an engagement for you Monday next  --  afternoon . Four o'clock if you say so . That all right ? If there 's any hitch , I 'll call you back . " His voice lost its directness and concern . " Coming up to see us ? " he asked . " And how about coming back here , anyhow , instead of going with this fellow Disola ? He 's just a kind of college professor , anyway  --  Ph.D . Just a plain common highbrow , not a ball of fire like me . Of course we ca n't pay you more than twenty-five a week , and there 's no opportunity , but we 've got a very refined and lovely store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No thanks , although I 'll surely come up to see you . You 're a lamb , Mr. Saylor , you know . I remember when I first saw you , how scared I was and how sweet you were , but I 'm tired of drawingclothes for women . I should think all you people would be tired of selling them . " Mr. Saylor chuckled . " They have to wear ' em , do n't they ? " " Not necessarily . At least , not with so much waste of time or so much concentration on themselves . All the average woman has time to do is to have babies and change her waist line . " " Tut ! Tut ! " Mr. Saylor 's voice was reproving . " What kind of ap213saleswoman are you ? And what are you trying to start , anyhow ? What would happen to susceptible men like me , for instance , if your platform went through ? Women not bothering about clothes ? It 's bad enough as it is . Well , I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mean about wearing clothes , but because you 're a nowoman . No-women usually have ideas , Look here  --  " he gave her an address on North Broad Street  --  " You go there , see . Ninth floor . And I 'm not a lamb . I 'm a wolf . Just the worst sort of a wolf  --  I 've got the worst thoughts . You 'd be surprised . " He chuckled . " But I 'll let you in on a secret , now you 're no longer working for me . Listen , sugar , I 'm miserable . Yes , I am . I 've got a wife and three children , and I 'm crazy about her . Sure . Crazy . Ever hear worse luck ? Yes , sir  --  crazy . Who 's the unluckiest man in the world ? A married man crazy about his wife . She 's got him . It 's wonderful to be able to talk to you in this carefree way . I hope some other pretty girls up here will resign . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mavis hung up the phone , smiling . He was a terribly nice little man , really . Generous and helpful until , and often unexpectedly , the squat god of business interfered . Then he could be as cruel as ice and as ruthless as a whip.  |p214THE  TAXICAB made its way down Chestnut Street from Broad Street Station  --  Cassianut Street was only three blocks south and two east . The city was beginning to go home . That is , the office workers were beginning to go home ; the shop people still had an hour or more of bad air and tired feet . The narrow sidewalks of Chestnut Street were crowded , but the street itself , a one-way street , was deserted . Down the middle of it , trolley cars , fairly empty since they were at this time of day going in the wrong direction , clanged and thumped . Chestnut Street had n't changed much either , thought Felix . There were new facades , but it was still the narrowest and most disorderly and most crowded great shopping street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , clothes , jewels , furs , stared helplessly from behind plate-glass windows at passers-by too intent upon threading their way through the jostling and elbowingto pause and look . But when the cab turned into Twelfth Street , Felix saw something new . The slanting sun made a canyon of gold of Twelfth Street , and where had been houses in which people lived , there was nothing now but little shops and squat office buildings . The cab passed Sansom Street , narrow and forbidding , and Felix 's heart leapt again as it had at the first sight of the Schuylkill and the zoo . " We are about there , James , " he said in a muffled voice . And then he said , " Here we are . " To the right , an old square brick stable had come into view and a brick wall , crowned with spikes , enclosing the corner where Cassianut Street , running from east to west , cut across Twelfth . And overlooking what evidently was a long and spacious city garden were the side-elevation and back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fronting on Cassianut Street , was three stories high and beautifully proportioned , and the back buildings , the inevitable Philadelphia back buildings , marked by wide smallpanedwindows , were three stories high as well , but the roof had been dropped and the building narrowed so that the house made an ell , gracious and long . The house terminated and began , and occupied space , as a house should ; as if , that is , space had been waiting for the house all along and now that it was there that particular bit of space would never again be so satisfactorily filled . Felix took off his spectacles and put them in the breast pocket of his coat . Under his sunburn his cheeks were pink . He was surprised at the sudden sense of comfort and restfulness that had overtaken him , underlying his excitement . They knew how to build in those days , did n't they ? They built as they wanted . They did n't let architects and interior decorators bully them . Above the wall , between the wall and the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable , a huge old tulip magnolia in full bloom showed its upper half . It 's there ! thought Felix . But then it would be  --  this was the week after Easter . And perhaps the wistaria vine was in blossom , or nearly in blossom , around the small square glass-enclosed porch , reached by a French window , that jutted out from one end of the dining room . And perhaps there were still tulips and hyacinths and lilacs growing along the inside of the wall and bordering the brick path that encircledthe garden . The sun , over to the west , could not reach the rows of smallpanedwindows with their heavy wooden shutters newly painted white , but the paint of the shutters glistened none the less , and the sun caught the tips of the iron spikes along the garden wall so that they made a line of bright points . In the jumble of grimy and neglected buildings that surrounded it , the house with its garden stood up clean and self-respecting and as if it were quiet with an honest pride . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white marble guarded by wrought-iron railings . The design of the wrought-iron railings was a series of long and slim figure eights with bunches of grapes where the lines bisected , and the railingsp216had been painted black so often that they had a soft and fluid look and no longer the rigidity of iron . At their top was a wide carved double door , painted white , with a fanlight above it . Felix got out of the taxicab slowly and stood for a moment looking up at the house . Then he went up the steps and rang the bell . Old houses were gentle things , were n't they , that is if they were gracious and well kept ? And also , they should be gentling things . They could n't make a cruel or stupid man kinder or less stupid , but they might occasionally make even him think , and surely they would make a kind and wise man kinder and wiser . Old houses became eventually a charitable epitome of those who had lived in them . . . old houses forgot most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners had thought of trees , and line , and color , and gardens . Felix heard footsteps in the vestibule behind the heavy outer door . A little old woman , very neat , stood peering and blinking up at him in the dimming light . She was a thin little old woman , so thin that she reminded Felix of a burned-out match , and her thin iron-gray hair , the iron-gray that never changes , was parted in the middle and pulled back above her ears into a sparse knot , but her eyes were gray and bright , and in the depth of their wariness and inspection Felix found reassurance . " I 'm IVIr . Macalister , " he said . " And you 're Mrs. Ross . Is that right ? " He smiled at the little old woman and she made an abrupt bobbing bow and smiled back . Felix was touched by her look of relief . It must be very hard to live in a house that is not your own until you feel it is your own , but all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the house , James Peace following him . The house was a little dark for some of the shutters had not been opened , and overlying the spicy smell of soap and floor wax was the faint aroma of unoccupancy , a dry breathless smell , especiallynoticeable when the last tenant has been death . Felix went along the hall followed by Mrs. Ross and James . Perhaps it was he who was breathless.  |p217Yes  , everything was the same  --  the Sheraton table and chairs , the prints of " The Republican Court , " of " Coming of Age in the Time of Queen Elizabeth " ; everything was the same . Farther along , the hall curved to the right to make place for broad stairs that , clinging to the left wall of the house , came down with a gentle final sweep of white uprights and glistening mahogany rail to a newel post on top of which the glistening mahogany coiled upon itself until it met a carved ivory button . Exactly ! thought Felix . At the curve of the hall there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door the hall led into the dining room , and beyond the dining room were a pantry and the kitchen . And when you went up the stairs you came to a half-landing before the stairs made a right angle and climbed to the second story , and from the half-landing four steps to the left cut through the solid wall and ascended into the library . On the third floor was the same arrangement ; a half-landing , rooms beyond it , and then the final climb to the actual third story . In nowhere except Philadelphia did you see houses built this way , except in imitation , and it was a lovely and sensible way to build them . At the stairs , Mrs. Ross assumed command . " I think you 'll find everything neat and ready , sir , " she said . " I 've made up the secondstoryback room as your bedroom  --  that was Mr. Felix 's room  --  and the front room next to it is an upstairs sitting room . That 's the way Mr. Felix had it , but of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 'll be odd , calling you Mr. Felix too . " She came to the second-story landing and paused , a trifle breathless , by the window that lighted the hall . " You do n't favor him much , sir , " she said . " He was tall and red-like . And he was a very quiet man  --  even quieter than you . But a nice gentleman to work for if you did exactly what he wanted . You wo n't find things much changed since you were a boy except in the bedroom and private sitting room  --  he did those over to suit himself . Mr. Felix was a great hand for having things exactly as they were . When we had to re-paper the third-story hall , he hunted for over a year for the same paper as had been put on forty years before . Quite a chase it was as I remember it . " Mrs. Ross looked out of the window to Twelfth Street . " It will be nice having you , " she said without turning around . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by yourself . Linda creaks-like sometimes.  |p220of  us has seen a soufflee for years . Down at the college where I come from , they do n't make them . You keep on cooking , and I 'll keep on eating , and I 'm sure we 'll get along together wonderfully . " She looked down and then up , fingering her apron . " And you would like me to stay , sir ? " There was something in her voice that made Felix both want to laugh and cry . " Will you ? " " Yes , sir  --  I 'd be glad to . I cooked for your uncle for fifteen years . " Felix tried to reassure her completely . This was the same thing that often made him want to laugh and cry where James Peace was concerned . He put his hand on her shoulder . How thin and tiny it was ; the bones and flesh of an old woman . " Mrs. Ross , " he said , " you can stay just as long as I do  --  this house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think I was coming up here to kick you out ? " She drew in her breath , ducked , and disappeared . Felix went over to a window and looked down into the garden . The tulip magnolia save for a few feet of trunk was hidden by its blossoms , and the tulips , crimson , yellow and mauve , were out , and the hyacinths , white and blue and rose , but the lilacs were still bare . Felix 's childhood fondness for city gardens came back to him  --  they were so secret and yet so surrounded  --  like a man with an idea alone with it in a crowd . He would use that garden ; walk in it , read in it , meditate in it . The corner where the house stood had suddenly grown quiet . It was half past six . The trolleys on their flat wheels bumped past at intervals making a great sound of grinding and a metallic whiningas they crossed the intersecting tracks , and a good many cars still made their way south on Twelfth Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little while ago , were now almost deserted . Felix realized that at this hour almost all the life of the district had been drained out of it . From what little he had seen he surmisedthat few people lived here any longer ; just he and James Peace and Mrs. Ross , and a handful of others , and possibly Mrs. Ross 's Presbyterian sister if she had n't gone home yet to herp221saloon-keeping husband . Dusk had scattered the daytime inhabitants . They had fled in the trolleys and in their various cars , shining , battered , cheap , expensive , to mysterious houses , poor , medium , rich , miles away . He wondered for how many blocks , east , west , north and south , this loneliness continued . For a good many , he imagined . In the growing darkness and the quiet , the old house seemed to grow taller . You could almost feel it growing taller . Felix could imagine its roofs and chimneys looking out over the city . It was exciting living in a city  --  like being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in a section of the city that was lonely at night ; then the city , like a presence , came back to you . James Peace over by the highboy spoke meditatively . " It 's a sure proud old house , " he said . " A mighty proud old house . Lots of folks have lived here . " " Most of my family have but myself , " said Felix . " This is the first night I 've ever spent in it . " He loved the way he and James Peace spoke to each other so much by means of elisions , and silences , and understandings . He went over and looked at the letters Mrs. Ross had left for him . There was one from Carl sent by air mail . That was nice of Carl . Just like him . A sort of long-distance welcoming letter . Carl would know how lonely he would be on this first night . The other letters were advertisements and a few invitations , the latter discreetimpersonal little tea cards . " Mrs. Sydney Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Penna . April 24th. 4  --  6 P.M. "  --  " Mr. and Mrs. Price Slocum Selfridge . Ilunt Farm . Whitemarsh , Pa . May 3rd. 4 to 7 . Cocktails " ; and so on . How speedily people knew you were in a city if you had some connections and a supposedly good address , especially people who had heard that you had inherited a fortune . . . . Felix awoke toward dawn . For a while he lay listening to the stillness of the house , only at rare intervals now a trolley car clanged across the intersection . You could hear the car coming for blocks before it arrived , and then the sound of it decreasing in the distance . Felix at first had tried to sleep , but finding that impossible , had thrown back the covers , and lighting a cigarette , had gone to a window . lie leaned on the sill looking down once more into the garden.  | The tulip magnolia , catching the lights of Twelfth Street , was a cloud of amazing beauty . A magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stared at the night . All about him the city slept , the huge sprawling city , with nothing to catch the eye and focus it as in New York  --  just the huge lowroofedsprawling city spreading out like a dark river . Could he live in this city ? Could he make it in his mind and heart a home ? And above all , could he do his work here and keep himself sufficiently aloof and intact ? It was a strong sluggish city  --  he could feel that , and this was a strong old house . Well , he was going to see Mr. Wilde in a few hours  --  the unknownMr . Wilde  --  and he would be able better to order his plans . At least , he would stay here for a while . He would give the city a chance , and at the worst it would be an interesting experience . In reality , it was his city . For years the blood that was his had pulsed here . But he would n't commit himself  --  not yet . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken hold of him.  |p223FOR  THIRTY-FIVE years , exactly at a quarter to eight each morningexcept on Sundays , Mrs. Daniel Wilde had had breakfast with her husband under the delusion that it was a wife 's duty to do so and that this attention invariably pleased the masculine mind . Duringbreakfast , Mrs. Wilde told Mr. Wilde what she had done the day before , unless there had been an opportunity for extended narration the preceding night ; what she intended to do on the day just beginning ; and what had happened or would happen to any one who hindered her . On the occasions when these subjects did not last the required half hour , she discussed current events or personalities , upbraiding both with equal impartiality . At a quarter past eight , Mrs. Wilde , arising from the table , accompanied her husband to the Tudor porte-cochere of the Tudor mansion in Chestnut Hill , where , surrounded by hedges , clipped bushes , three acres of priceless land , a number of formal flowers such as hydrangeas and alyssum saxatile compactum , the Wildes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilde had kissed her husband good-bye , first , as he stepped into a carriage to be driven to the station , later as he stepped into a sober and handsome motor car to be driven into town ; for the past fifteen years , omitting the kiss , she had tapped him lightly on the shoulder and had said archly , " Be good , " a phrase that annoyed Mr. Wilde exceedingly . After a year of this , just as he was entering what have been called " the desperate fifties , " he had said to himself one morning while being driven around the circular drive and out through the gate by Jansen , who had been with the family for three decades , " I will if I want , and I 'll be damned if I will if I do n't . " For several days he had felt better . The moment Mr. Wilde , driven by Jansen , had slid out fromp224under the porte-cochere , Mrs. Wilde went upstairs , rang for her maid , and changed from the lacy negligee she always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feminine " into one of the expensive and workmanlike tweed suits she preferred . That these emphasized an extremely broad and determined hinterland did riot bother Mrs. Wilde in the least ; she was far too busy ever to look behind her . Mrs. Wilde , despite her soft and growing cream-white contours and her voluble and disconnected conversation , was , as a matter of fact , a far better executive than her husband . He had been pushed into it , she had been born to it . There were times when Mr. Wilde with a sigh reflected that had he been wise he might by now have been a contemplative country judge or a teacher of legal philosophy . After all , it was in his blood , was n't it ? For six generations , son following father , there had been a Wilde , three of them Daniels , at the Bucks County bar ; quiet , distinguished , extremelyupright lawyers . He , the present Daniel , had been the first to descend upon the great city to the south . At the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to him especiallywhen he was tired . The vision was of a quiet country office on a summer 's afternoon , the windows open , the smell of honeysuckle from outside mixed with the smell of leather-bound books from within ; across the street , vine-covered houses with wide porches , and off to the left a field of corn . This had been his father 's office . And in the somnolence of three o'clock he could hear a voice speaking , patiently , amicably , intently trying to explain some perplexity to a listener . In the voice was nothing but desire to resolve confusion . In his more depressed moments , which were frequent , Mr. Wilde said to himself : I suppose I am one of the leading lawyers of this city . I help to handle the affairs of great corporations . I am paid large fees . Yes , he would add hastily , and I spend them . . . . None the less , I am respected ; I 'm an authority . I could have been a United States Senator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't had a single moment since I left law school to discover what the law is all about . But Mrs. Wilde was " a Follansbee , " which was something different . For over two hundred years the Follansbees had been doing good and directing others , whether the others wanted it or not.  |p225The  original Roger Follansbee , a shipwright , had landed on the shores of the Delaware in 1710 and within ten years had split wide open the small Church of England congregation to which he had at first adhered , had started a chapel of his own , and had made numerous changes , most of them inadvisable , in the boats that plied the river and sailed for Europe . His success had been largely due to a partner , whom he treated badly , and a wife who bore him ten children with her mind as far removed from thoughts of her husband as possible . His son William had had an even more distinguishedcareer . At twenty he had married a Ripon , already , through the mysteriousprocesses inherent in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had made ten thousand pounds through the sale of a swamp , given him in payment of a bad debt , which happened to be in the course of the westward expansion of the growingtown ; and at fifty , his first wife having died , he had married a Sawyer , an ugly woman who brought him another ten thousand pounds . In 1777 , courageous and patriotic to the last , at the age of sixty-six , he had trafficked profitably with the British during the occupancy of Lord Howe , and when , four years later , he had died of a fit of apoplexy induced by the writing of an insulting letter to General Washington on the conduct of the war  --  by this time he had noticed how the wind was setting and had become an ardent American  --  the whole town had turned out to his funeral . His portrait , pointed out to public-school children , now hangs in Independence Hall . With William Follansbee began the Follansbee reputation for charity and good works , a profitable investment if you remember the Biblical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no matter how made , and the worldly counsel to keep ninety per cent for yourself . The charities to which William Follansbee gave , and the institutions which he helped to found , did not quite take care of the bankrupts which , indirectly or directly , he made . Perhapsthe most typical day was when , an active man of forty-one , he was admitted in 1752 as the first patient of the newly completed Pennsylvania Hospital to whose founding he had contributed so much of his time and money . Some regarded this as a coincidence engineered by a Providence interested in the judicious promotion of a worthy object , others , fanatically admiring , as the deliberate self-sacrifice of a public-spirited man advertising a new institution , but the truth was that he had broken his ankle falling through the decayed floor of a hovel from which he was personally evictingan obstinate female tenant , the widowed mother of four children . With the exception of this unfortunate incident , the Follansbees continued to do good , generation after generation , in the face of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steady if unspectacularincrease in their fortunes and a minimum of physical risk . A later Follansbee , Colonel Follansbee  --  Mrs. Wilde 's grandfather  --  hadeven performed the difficult feat of evading the Civil War entirely but at the same time emerging from that conflict with a proudly retained military title , unrecognized by the federal government but used by all his fellow citizens . He had accomplishedthis by first sending a substitute when his name appeared in the draft , and secondly , as the struggle grew fiercer , by raising and equipping a Pennsylvania regiment whose actual colonel he met for the first time and thought rather " a common fellow " as the regiment left for the front . Afterwards , he was prominent in various veterans ' organizations and felt it his duty to go to the Union League once a week , although he regarded that organization as on the whole beneath him socially . The motto under the Follansbee coat of arms , an extremely intricate and imaginative coat of arms which had appeared mysteriouslyafter William Follansbee 's son had gone to England in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Integros haurire fontos , " which means , " to draw from unpolluted fountains " ; a somewhat sardonic command considering the amount of typhoid prevalent in Philadelphiaduring the nineteenth century and the contempt with which the Follansbees , one after another , had combated the suggestions of various " spendthrift " city governments " to waste the money of the people " in improving the water supply . Generation after generation the Follansbees had been regarded , not only by themselves but by every one else , as typical citizens of the better class . Mrs. Wilde , having changed into one of her tweed suits , five mornings out of the week went into town . She was president , chairwoman , or director of a score of organizations charitable orp227otherwise , her interests ranging from the opera and the city 's orchestrato politics , and with the exception of the last , which now for eight years had made her increasingly angry , she was able to dispose of the majority of problems presented to her , especially artistic ones , with a few brief ex cathedra sentences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent plus a passion for command , unless constantly referred back to human standards , is likely to increase with age , especially with women , until it becomes practically a continuous orgasm . Tyranny and hair grow coarser with the years . Because Mrs. Wilde 's secretariesbreathed heavily while leaning over her shoulder , she took for granted that the habit was inherent in the class . The only person Mrs. Wilde had never been able to impress was her Italian-Swiss gardener . At least two mornings out of every week he would send her into town brooding upon the coming revolutionand the sorrows of the undefended rich . The next day she would have her revenge , she would overwhelm him with Latin names she had culled from her collection of seed-catalogues . " I think , " she would say in a dismissing and casual voice , " we 'll plant some Philadelphia virginal this year and a great deal more scabiosa caucasica . How 's the divaricata canadensis ? " But the difficulty was that subsequently she could n't herself remember what the terms meant . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that subjectalone she stood in awe of her husband . Mr. Wilde had a small greenhouse in which , with quiet passion , he raised flowers out of season , especially carnations . He was an authority on carnations . He and the gardener understood each other perfectly . On the morning of the day after Felix had arrived at 1205 Cassianut Street , Mrs. Wilde , sitting at breakfast with her husband , suddenly asked a question which showed that at times she was interested in something besides her own activities . She spoke with unexpected directness . As a rule she began her sentences with a series of liquid noises as if getting up steam for the pressure that followed . One suspected her of absent-mindedness until overwhelmedby the rush of words that followed . " Thup  --  did he turn up ? " she asked . Mr. Wilde , who had been brooding on the steady disintegrationp228of the world , especially the United States , raised his head from the stirring of his coffee . " Who , my dear ? " " Felix  --  what 's his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel ? " " Macalister . " " Did he turn up ? " Mr. Wilde nodded . " I imagine so . I have had no notice to the contrary . " Mr. Wilde was invariably kind and gentle to his wife . There was no use quarrelling with a bargain that you had made yourself , nor could one possibly reconstruct in their entirety the emotions and motives of thirty-five years before . One could hardly reconstructin their entirety the emotions and motives of an hour earlier . Mr. Wilde had a vague impression that his wife had been a beauty , a blackberry-and-cream beauty , and of course a marriage with a Follansbee and a minor heiress had been no unimportant matter to a shy , dark , secretive young lawyer from Bucks County . Beyondthat , Mr. Wilde had been far too busy to regard women in any light save that of clients . Mrs. Wilde emerged from a moment of unaccustomed meditation . She sighed . " What a lovely old house it is , is n't it ? " she said . " Thup  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garden and all . . . . Daniel , I do wish when I 'm speaking to you , you 'd pay attention to me .... Anyway , a perfect specimen of the Philadelphiahouse of i800 , is n't it ? Did his uncle leave him much money ? That is  --  what's-his-name ? " " Do you mean young Macalister ? " asked Mr. Wilde in the calm but slightly acidulous voice with which at tines he tried to order his wife 's sentences . " Why , yes , a very tidy fortune I should say . Very tidy , indeed . Nothing spectacular , as such things are counted nowadays , but pretty solid . Very solid , as a matter of fact . Part of it in depreciated real estate that will have to be squeezed fairly hard to keep its interest up , and naturally some securities that are not what they were  --  after all , we 've been through a depression  --  but I should say that net  --  " Mr. Wilde knit his brows in calculation  --  " an income of about fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fifty thousand or more . The estate is worth , I should say , around a million and a half . "  | " Thup ! " said Mrs. Wilde . " A million and a half ! I should say not . " She was silent for a moment . " I do hope he 's attractive , " she resumed musingly. "  --  The sort of man a girl could marry . I do think it 's dreadful when unattractive people have money . Do n't you ? . . . Daniel , we 'll have to be nice to him , of course . Do you suppose we 'll have to ask him up to Close Harbor ? I only hope he 's not as queer as he sounds . " " Queer ? " asked Mr. Wilde . " Why yes , a professor or something in a little Southern college , and never coming to Philadelphia to see his family , and going off into the jungle , and all that sort of business . He must be queer . Why , Daniel , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes I think you must be queer yourself . Ca n't you imagine what he looks like ? There was that scandal , too . Remember ? " Mr. Wilde grimaced and shook his head . " No , my dear . I was too busy about that time getting started in law and marrying you . No  --  I had no time for scandals  --  not then . Besides , I was still enough of a stranger to believe that all Philadelphia women loved their husbands . " " Horrid , " said Mrs. Wilde . " Perfectly horrid  --  at least every one thought so at the time . Horrid , but ideas have changed . Ran off together in the days when people ran off instead of getting divorced . You must remember , Daniel ? All over Europe , living as man and wife . I heard about it as a girl . He 's too young to be a professor , anyhow . " Mr. Wilde raised his head and stared at her with the slightly puzzled frown with which not infrequently he greeted her conclusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he decided . " It 's twelve past . " " A queer family , " continued Mrs. Wilde . " Very . Still that French blood in them , even the light-haired ones . Comes out unexpectedly . Lydia seems the only one who 's been at all normal , and there was that talk even about her and David Wroth years ago . Remember , Daniel ? And as for Felix , this boy 's uncle , he was just as queer as he could be . " Mrs. Wilde sighed and shook her head . " Living abroad so much , and collecting things , and hardly ever speaking to any one . To tell you the truth , Daniel , I never liked him very much . Handsome ? Not one bit . Not a bit . I thought him conceited  --  sandy-haired and tall , standing around at balls with his hands in his pockets and that superior look on his face . And then occasionally dancing with you as if he were doing you a favor . Horrid , I thought him . No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever see Wirth ? " " Good heavens , no , " said her husband , " why should I ? " " Well , you belong to the same club , do n't you ? " " Our hours are different . " " They tell me he 's gone completely insane , living in one room of that dirty old house of his on Thirteenth Street and hoarding his money , and paddling around to that club of yours very night for dinner , and gorging himself there , and speaking to no one , except to nod . " Mrs. Wilde paused for breath . " Thup ! They even say he keeps the soles of his shoes on with rubber bands he steals from banks . " Mr. Wilde smiled , his queer grimacing smile . " Harmless , at all events . Dangerously insane people , even nowadays , do n't eat their dinners every night at well-run clubs . " Once more Mrs. Wilde spoke directly and simply . She sighed and shook the lace out over her wrists . " I hate to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-looking in a sort of flamboyant racetracksort of way  --  much better looking than Felix . I remember girls were frightened of him but liked it . Let 's see  --  " She looked up at the ceiling and then down . Her usually expressionless voice was wistful . " Wirth must have been about twenty-nine when I was eighteen , and Felix was two years older . He must be seventy-one now  --  Wirth . Is n't it queer , Daniel ? I thought him an old rather dissipated man when I was eighteen , like some one out of Byron , and he was only twenty-nine , and now he 's seventy . " Her opaque slate-colored eyes darkened . " Felix was seventy-three , " said Mr. Wilde , " when he died two months ago . " He looked at his watch and stood up from the table . " Well , " he said , " and now I must be off . Take good care of your-self . " Mrs. Wilde shook the lacy ruffles of her sleeve down again over her plump white forearm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot on which were her coat of arms and the motto " integros haurire fontos . " Usually Mr. Wilde spent the first five minutes of the twenty-fivep231that took him into town wondering why he had never told his wife that he liked to breakfast alone . He had his own ideas about breakfast which was why he looked forward to the summer . Breakfasteither was an interval dedicated to solitary condemnation of events and the personages engaged in them , or it was nothing . Breakfast should be like the commination services held in Englishchurches , except that it took place three hundred and sixty-five times a year . And very purging and revivifying it was if properly understood , especially for a self-controlled man . The rest of the day one was too busy  --  or should be . From June fifteenth to October first , Mrs. Wilde was in Close Harbor , and except for the two reluctant weeks Mr. Wilde was also there on what ironically was called " his holiday , " he had the ChestnutHill house to himself . This was soothing and restoring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up at six instead of seven , and before breakfast walked in the garden and smelled the trees and inspected whatever had blossomed that dawn . This reconnoitering never lost for him its recurrent excitement ; he felt like some soft-treading midsummer detective . You see , you knew something was going to happen , and you watched , and then one morning it had happened . But this morning Mr. Wilde was preoccupied as Jansen , at the forty miles per hour commanded , and no faster , drove through the springtime reaches of St. Martins , and the outer edge of Germantown , and then down the sylvan gorge of Wissahickon Drive into the valley of the Schuylkill . Mr. Wilde was in a placid farawaymood , somewhat like a man who has received a mortal wound too clean and sharp for pain , and at the back of this mood was a sardonic chuckle . In fact , Mr. Wilde felt more at peace with life than he had felt for a long while . He was in possession of a couple of subtle jokes , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke . He was a bankrupt , and within a year or so he was going to die . And no one except himself knew that these two facts put together made a subtle joke . For if you are a bankrupt and going to die , no court in all God 's world could catch up with you . Bankruptcy in itself is no joke , and Mr. Wilde for several years past had known that ; he had felt , save when he had steadfastly pushed the thought away from him , like a trapped and hopeless animal . Mr. Wilde had known that he was working against time . Sooner or later his creditors would come down on him and then it would be all over . Meanwhile , he was able barely to keep his head above water by means of his large fees ; barely able to meet his current expenses and enough of the interest on his obligations to allay suspicion . But you could n't chase the devil forever around the stump , could you , and Mr. Wilde no longer had the courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his present fix . He was too old and too tired . But now he no longer cared . He had n't cared since four o'clock the afternoon before . He could hold out for another year or so , and when he died his large life insurance would cover his debts and permit Martha just enough to live on ; just enough  --  her own estate had been greatly diminished . She did n't know this yet , but that United Power back in ' 35 had been the final blow . Anyhow , Martha would have enough to live on quietly and conservatively , and that was a joke too , when you came to think of it . Imagine Martha bereft of the authority her wealth had always given her . There was only one thing that worried Mr. Wilde . Much as he despised the behavior and opinions of his daughter Harriet , terriblyas Harriet had hurt him , he did not like to think of leaving her helpless in her mother 's power . No , that would n't be good . He knew what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , provided her with her apartment  --  her studio , and if he left her penniless , she would have to come home and lead the sort of life her mother thought she should lead . Mr. Wilde had no illusions about Harriet for all her independence and talk of economic and political freedom . Harriet was incapable of earning her own living . That was one of the things that made Mr. Wilde especially contemptuous of Harriet and all her kind . The damned softhanded , soft-minded Communists and revolutionaries , he was fond of saying to himself ! None the less Harriet was his daughter , and he did not want to leave Harriet defenseless . It was not good to leave any young woman defenseless , but it was especially not good to leave a young woman defenseless when she had a mother like Harriet 's . Mr. Wilde was well versed in the psychology of the tyrant ; he had lived with it for a good many years . It was a habit of mind , and misfortune did not chasten it . Confine it to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more strongly . Deprived of her secretaries , her various attentive boards , her pensioners humble because of prospective gifts , Mrs. Wilde would concentrate upon the only victim left . And hers was the most difficult of all tyranniesto combat , because it was completely self-justified , because it was wounded at the slightest hint of opposition , even the oppositionof silence . Mr. Wilde sometimes felt that for thirty-five years his home , where he was concerned , had been a temple of silence . Nor had Harriet , while she had lived there , been of any help . To the contrary , she had only added to the discomfort . Harriet was her mother , stream-lined . The Follansbee blood had now discovered the proletariat ; in fact , this being America , had invented one . Reluctantly  --  yes , the word was not too strong , Mr. Wilde had come almost to hate Harriet even while he loved her . He hated her with the wistful , baffled , slow-burning hatred of a father whose daughter , an only child , has gone out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all he considers valuable and fine . Sometimesin the middle of the night Mr. Wilde awoke and could not go to sleep thinking about Harriet . It seemed to him as if she were possessed of some sort of demon ; a devastating and modernone he did not understand . And yet he knew that at one word from her he would forgive her utterly , only , under present conditions , that word would never be spoken . Mr. Wilde tried not to think of Harriet any more than he could help . He was glad when she insisted upon having an apartment  --  a studio  --  of her own where she could see the sort of people she liked to see and carve the hideous amorphous things she liked to carve . He had had enough of her sitting at his table alert to catch him up on every statement he made ; her sullen intelligent thin face , her red long mouth , her burning dark eyes , a question mark and a rebuke . If she had only had the opulent coloring of her mother he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it seemed an added insult that she should be so dark , so secretive , so slim . She was his child . Yes , Mr. Wilde told himself , with the search for the truth , the urge toward analysis the law had taught him , painful as it was , he had to admit that he resented Harriet . He resented her so much that he longed to take her in his arms and shake her and crush the nonsense out of her  --  to stroke her hair blindly . Often when he had been with her his heart hurt like an aching throat and his lips felt as if there was blood on them . Often , too , when he lay awake at night his eyes had a curious dryness as if  --  which was nonsense  --  it would be a satisfaction to weep . That was hatred , Mr. Wilde told himself , and he regretted it . He deprecated deep emotion , anyway ; it was ill-bred , unjudicial . He glanced out of the open window of his car . A lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at hand . Mr. Wilde smiled faintly . The curious grimace , almost painful , that was his smile lifted the corners of his short grizzled moustache . He was well aware , of course , what had been in his wife 's mind when she had inquired so earnestly concerning young Macalister  --  this professor , or whatever he was  --  whom he was to see at three o'clock that afternoon . Well  --  a very interesting history and a nice fortune . An excellent fortune , and Mr. Wilde was quite willing to be polite to Macalister  --  would be anyhow  --  if he were at all presentable , but he was n't very optimistic where Harriet was concerned . Harriet was like a grizzly bear toward all the men he and her mother picked out as suitable . Quite clearly she preferred the company of her inferiors . But still , you could n't tell . It was worth trying , anyway , and the Close Harbor idea was an excellent one . Harriet up in Maine was at her best . At least she became unselfconscious enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result forgot a trifle of her sullenness , and her face was pretty , anyway , and in a bathing suit her figure was seductive . Yes , it was worth trying , and possibly the queerness of this young man  --  this Macalister  --  would in this case be an asset . Harriet liked queer people . Meanwhile he  --  her father  --  would have to see if there was n't some way of leaving her a little money of her own . He might be able to take out more life insurance ? No , he could n't do that . Mr. Wilde grimaced . He had entirely forgot . The recollection of the subtle joke  --  the double-barrelled joke  --  came back to him . No , he could n't take out more life insurance . This time he did not smile . Instead , he lay back against the cushions of the seat and closed his eyes , and for a moment felt a trifle sick , and then he opened his eyes and smiled , remembering with amusement poor old Jack Ambruster 's solicitude and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Ambruster had started practice , and for twenty years Ambruster had been his doctor . Poor fellow , he had thought he had been pronouncing a death sentence when all the while he had been granting a reprieve . " You insist upon the truth ? " Jack Ambruster had said . " You say you must get your affairs in order ? " " Do n't be a damn fool , " Mr. Wilde had reiterated . " Of course I insist upon the truth . What do you think I am  --  a child ? What 's the verdict , eh ? Tell me . " The shadowy inner office seemed to him the quietest place he had ever been in , and despite his lined face and white hair , Jack Ambruster , because he was ten years younger , had seemed a very young man . Mr. Wilde wished that he too were only fifty-eight . A nurse opened the door and stuck her head in and said , " Oh , I beg your pardon Jack Ambruster had been irrationally angry . " God damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'm going to fire her . She must lead a careless private life . She opens doors without knocking . " He had tapped his lips thoughtfullywith a pencil , and then he had turned his head swiftly and stared at Mr. Wilde , his eyes bright . " Daniel , " he said . he spoke rapidly . " I think you have fairly advanced nephritis  --  all the tests , and that blood pressure of yours , and the slight swelling of the face and hands , and the irregularity of the heart , and your tiredness  --  what you call your sinking spells . Yes  --  damn it . Daniel , in fact , I 'm quite sure . But I 'd like you to consult a couple of other men of course , and then I 'd like you to go down to the Pennsylvania Hospital for a while . " " Nonsense , " said Mr. Wilde . " I 'll consult no one and I 'm far too busy to go to a hospital . I 'm getting along fairly well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's disease , " said Doctor Ambruster . " Oh , " said Mr. Wilde after a moment of silence . " That 's usually fatal , is n't it ? " " Not necessarily . If you do exactly as I tell you and follow exactly what I prescribe , you 'll have a couple of good years anyway , and maybe some more . " Jack Ambruster 's face had become stern . " But you must n't work too hard , and you must do exactly what I say . "  | " Certainly , " said Mr. Wilde . " I always have . " But he had n't the slightest intention of altering his life in any particular , in fact , if anything , he 'd accelerate it . " No , you have n't , " said Doctor Ambruster . " I told you long ago to have a thorough going over every six months . You have n't been here for a year . " " You doctors are incredibly rapacious , " said Mr. Wilde.  | " SATYRS be somewhat like men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead , and are like to goats in their feet . St. Anthony saw such an one in the wilderness . These wonderful beasts be divers , for some of them be called Cynocephali , for they have heads as hands , and seem beasts rather than men ; and some be called Cyclops , and have that name because each of them hath but one eye , and that in the middle of the forehead ; and some be all headless and noseless and their eyes be in their shoulders ; and some have plain faces without nostrils , and the nether lips of them stretch so that they veil therewith their faces when they be in the heat of the sun . Also in Scythia be some with so great and large ears that they spread their ears and cover all their bodies with them , and these be called Panchios . " And others there be in Ethiopia , and each of them have only one foot , so great and so large that they beshadow themselves with the foot when they lie gasping on the ground in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so swift that they be liken to hounds in swiftness of running , and therefore among the Greeks they be called Cynopodes . Also some have the soles of their feet turned backward behind the legs , and in each foot eight toes , and such go about and stare in the desert . " Felix raised his head from the Thirteenth Century Encyclopedia , a slim eighteenth-century edition , open on the table before him , and smiled and took a sip of coffee . He had found the Thirteenth Century Encyclopedia among his uncle 's especial books as , the previous afternoon , he had found Bigland 's History of Birds , Fishes , Reptiles and Insects . " Satyrs be somewhat like men ! " Well , they still were , were n't they ? Or rather , men were still somewhat like satyrs . And Mr.p238Bigland ! How wonderful and comforting it must have been to believe that all things were created for the best no matter how unlikely that seemed . Mild April sunshine flooded the little porch that jutted off from the dining room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was the smell of grass and bushes and earth , and above that , the warm smell of the city . From beyond the brick wall came the steady sound of traffic . The hyacinths and tulips in their narrow beds were gay . It was eight o'clock and Felix was having breakfast . He was finding the porch delightful as he had thought ; it was n't at all " grittylike , " as Mrs. Ross had gloomily predicted , and he even enjoyed the bumping and squealing noise of the traffic , it sounded cheerful  --  through the ghost city of the night before the stream of life was once more flowing . Against the pale-blue sky the old house stood up quiet and self-contained like an elderly man who has slept well . James Peace had completely forgot his dark humors of the night before . He did not sigh as he moved about the small table , and that was the final drop that filled Felix 's cup of satisfaction to the brim . He dreaded James Peace 's sighs ; he could not be happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content and interested . " Them flowers need spadin ' , Mistah Felix , " he said , nodding toward the tulips and hyacinths . " Flowers is always kinda angry in a city  --  you have to treat ' em special . And there 's a ' mysterious ' vine which ai n't been cut back in years . " Felix recognized this as the wisteria . He spread some honey on a piece of toast and the golden taste made him think of spring in general . " The season pricketh every gentle heart , and maketh him out of his sleep to start , " he repeated to himself , and suddenly there was a warm rush of emotion to his heart . Now God bless the spring he thought ; God bless it ! It was indeedthe season of resurrection . . . a symbol to all those who had ears to hear and eyes to see . No man or woman should ever become entirely old or utterly hopeless so long as there was spring to look forward to or back upon . And was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minds of " gentle " men all through the ages ? Nothing could ever completely cut that cord of light . No amount of temporary brutality or barbarism . Between gentlep239men and women , dead , living , and to come , there were a number of these cords of light ; they were like a secret radio code . Five hundred years ago a gentle poet , thought Felix , Chaucer , felt the spring as I am feeling it now . He lit a pipe and read the morning 's news . . . . England was still enjoying a spell of unprecedented good weather , and the English , unused to this , had turned from rejoicing to gloom  --  the nation was deeply stirred . Stocks were unsteady . Felix wondered if they had ever been anything else . Hitler had made another speech . Now that the abused and homesick Austrians had been taken back to the broad bosom of their racial mother , Germany had no further territorial ambitions . Any one who said she had , was a liar . He , thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A famouspsychopathologist in Chicago had announced that America had " a deteriorating social system . " Only the totalitarian states seemed determined to eliminate the unfit and " produce real men . " Herr Goebbels had been slapped by the husband of another actress . The spring social season in Philadelphia was reaching a climax  --  it occupied a full page . Felix refilled his pipe and went up to the second story front sittingroom to write some letters . He was badly behind in his correspondence . Carl 's note of welcome had been amusing and typical . " To the sound of cymbals and the aroma of the fatted calf , " Carl had written , " I welcome you . It 's the only fatted calf you 'll get . " But do n't tell your fellow citizens ; they would resent my presumption . Who am Ito welcome any one to their city ? I am not a Philadelphian . I was born in Albany . And I have never really lived in Philadelphia , merely on the outskirts , and then as no more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of the voluble contempt of the Virginians , nor have they the candid and courteous and dismaying blandness of Charleston , and they seldom have a trace of the icy rudeness of Boston  --  they 'll merely not elect you to something . " It was one o'clock before Felix had finished reading his mail and had answered part of it , and half past two , and time for him to get ready for his appointment with the mysterious Mr. Wilde , before he was aware of it . He went down into the hall and put on his coat reluctantly.  | He knew little of the law . In all his life , come to think of it , he had never but once consulted a lawyer , and then only for the briefest of dealings , his mother 's estate had been so small . He remembered the curt hurried young man he had seen in Detroit . Felix 's ideas of the profession were still largely taken from Dickens and the pleasant and leisurely offices he had known in the village of Maclean . Lawyers were either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrewd and kindly eyes , who had been in politics , or else young men of an equally dry wit , who were going into politics . He walked slowly up Cassianut Street to Broad , and then north along Broad to Chestnut , and then west a half a block until he came to the forbidding facade , grimy and ornate and Palladian , of the Gibraltar Trust Company . Over the magnificent door of wrought bronze was the motto , " Fide et Fiducia , " which no doubt explained why the Gibraltar Trust Company had been allowed by confiding stockholders to build an entirely profitless office building . Felix pushed a revolving glass door to the left of the wrought bronze door and found himself in a narrow hall where there was a battery of elevators . In a gloomy voice he informed the operator of the one he was allowed to enter that he wished to get off at the eleventh floor . He had never been able to make out whether business made people formidable , or formidable people entered business , but at all events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a singular lack of cheerfulness . No wonder periodic panic swept them like a wind through a cave . The elevator came to a velvet stop and Felix was urged into a long corridor where a series of doors stared at him like gray unfriendlyeyes , on their upper panels of ground glass the names Wilde , Holbrook , McCormick and Armstead . There was not a humannote except two discreet solid wooden doors at the farther end of the corridor , upon which , in gold , was , on the door to the left , the word " Men , " and , on the door to the right , the word " Women . " Felix hesitated . He was nervous and for a moment he had thought of going to the former , and then he changed his mind . Hat in hand , he timidly opened one of the glass-panelled doors upon which , in the lower right-hand corner of the panel was the word " Entrance . " He peered around the door . Three elderly Fates , two of them engaged in typewriting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . They had the plumpnessand unadorned neatness of women no longer interested in men . In their eyes was the tranquil indignation of cows interruptedwhile feeding . A very moral office , thought Felix , at least on the surface . " Is Mr. Wilde in ? " he stuttered , and slid around the door . The Fate engaged in filing letters , evidently the head Fate , looked at him antagonistically . " Mr. Wilde can see no one , " she said curtly , and returned to her filing cabinet . Then she looked up  --  " Have you an engagement ? " Felix wondered why it was that almost any subordinate could convince him that he was an impostor . He got on fairly well with important people  --  college presidents and people like that  --  but the youngest clerk or stenographer could send the blood to his head and make him doubt for a moment his own name . He advanced into the room . " I am Mr. Felix Macalister , " he said in a high strangled voice , not at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appointment with Mr. Wilde . " The effect was instantaneous . The typewriting Fates raised their heads again but now their eyes were interested ; the head Fate jumped to her feet apologetic and smiling . " Mr. Macalister ! Why , yes  --  of course Certainly . Mr. Wilde is expecting you . Wo n't you come this way ? " She opened a wicket in the railing that ran across the outer office and led Felix down an inner hall where there were several doors marked with the names of the partners . She stopped before a door marked " Mr. Wilde " and rapped . " Cone in , " said a voice . She opened the door and stepped aside for Felix , bowing and smiling . Some day , thought Felix grimly , God will decide to visit the earth again and they 'll mistake him for a Fuller-brush salesman . The tall thin man standing behind the desk littered with papers was coming around the corner of the desk , his hand extended . He was a man of about sixty-eight , dressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sober foulard tie and white starched collar , was a thin sallow face , marked by a short grizzled moustache and framed by closely cut gray sideburns that came down to the lobes of his ears . Iron-gray hair , parted at one side , accentuated the lemon-yellow sallowness of the face , the darkness of his brown speculative eyes . Spaniel eyes , thought Felix , but he has more to him than that or he would n't be wearing an orange carnation in his buttonhole . The hand Felix had taken was a curious hand , long-fingered and sensitive , but at the same time dry and lifeless ; you felt each bone as if there was no flesh covering it . " Will you get the papers in the Bartain Estate , Miss Stearns , " said the tall thin man , and then he turned to Felix again and his voice changed as if some stop had been suddenly opened . " My dear fellow ! Well  --  well , I 'm so glad to see you . Sit down . How are you ? Had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He smiled and waved to a chair beside the desk . Felix sat down and Mr. Wilde returned to the swivel-chair he had left . He leaned back in it continuing to smile  --  a most curious smile , Felix thought . Mr. Wilde 's smile was a pained grimace in which the spaniel eyes played no part , they were constantly watchfuland speculative , but there was at the same time a tired gentlenessin them . For a while longer Felix retained in his mind , sharp as a penand-inkdrawing , the memory of his first sight of the room and of Mr. Wilde . Mr. Wilde had been standing behind the desk , and there had been the square room , lined with glass-enclosed bookcases filled with big volumes bound in bilious-looking calf , and the three engravingsof legal dignitaries slightly askew on their wires above the bookcases  --  Coke , Blackstone and John Marshall , Felix thought  --  and , in curious contrast to the rest of the room , the small vase , white violets in it , rising from the litter on the desk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light pouring through it , and this had made the figure of Mr. Wilde for an instant merely a tall thin shadow . Through the wide window one could see a far expanse of the sprawling low-roofed city , the glimmering of a river in the distance , and the city stretched out without end , undistinguished , unaspiring , alluvial . Mr. Wilde was framed by this panorama as you sometimes see , in a portrait of the fifteenth century , the figure of a prince or bishop standing in perspective before the background of his lands . It was as if some clever artist had made the figure of Mr. Wilde vague in order to emphasize the city.  |p243Mr  . Wilde put his elbows on the arms of his swivel chair and locked his fingers under his chin . The spaniel eyes twinkled . " You are indeed the hero of a romance , are n't you ? " he said . " The hero of one of those extraordinary occurrences that are not so extraordinary after all , as we lawyers know . They happen fairly often . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " With the thought of death  --  the immunity it promises  --  even the wisest of men are likely to release their imaginations , their revenges , their desires , are n't they ? You 're a lucky young man , Mr. Macalister . " He waved a hand . " The world is largely yours . " " I suppose it is , " said Felix reluctantly . He was beginning to like Mr. Wilde ; Mr. Wilde was philosophic . Mr. Wilde looked at him sharply and grimaced . " Oh , but you must n't take it that way , " he said . " You must n't be alarmed . It is a grave responsibility , but you 'll find that money makes everything astonishingly easy . " He interrupted himself . " Or difficult . But that 's only when one is a fool . You must n't be alarmed . " " I 'm not alarmed , " said Felix , " I 'm only thoughtful . I had arranged my life very carefully  --  mostly work  --  and now I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dark eyes widened . " Ah  --  I see . Yes , I used to lie awake myself when I was your age thinking how old I was and how little I 'd done . Thirty-five . Exactly . How young that is ! The young delude themselves by thinking they 're old ; the old delude themselves by thinking they 're young . And you are engaged in a piece of work now ? " Felix leaned forward eagerly . All at once , he and Mr. Wilde were embarked upon a footnote . " I 'm just finishing a book , " he said . " I 've been on it twelve years . " " Twelve years ! " Mr. Wilde opened his eyes . " And what is it about ? " " Monkeys , " said Felix . " Monkeys and their relationship to men . Especially the New World , or American monkey . They are much more alert and adaptable , you know . The book is called The AmericanMonkey. "  | Mr. Wilde sat up straight in his chair . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come , although you may not be aware of it , to one of the centers of your investigation . Later on , for example , I will introduce you to some of my colleagues . " Felix 's eyes lit up back of his spectacles but his voice was grave . He decided that he was going to find at odd moments much pleasure in Mr. Wilde 's company . " Man , " he said , " can learn a great deal from the monkey , Mr. Wilde , if he will only approach the subject in a more humble and courteous spirit . My field of research has been challenged by severalof my confreres as too imaginative and not sufficiently exact , but if there is one thing that is obvious it is that every year science is getting more and more asomatic . " " Asomatic ? " inquired Mr. Wilde . He had picked up a pencil and was playing with it . Every now and then , as he studied Felix , in the spaniel eyes were little flashes of light , darting across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Felix . " Asomatic is the opposite of physical , material . No sooner did we scientists get the average man to admit that he was no more than a handful of salt and water , than we turn around , or rather , in my humble opinion , go immensely forward , and speak of waves of probability ' and how the ultimate road to reality may lead to the conviction of mind reigning supreme and alone . ' I am quoting , " he added modestly , " Sir James Jeans . But then there 's Eddington , of course , and Milliken , and a lot more . Physicists principally . But if we get the physicists believing in the mind and spirit , after a while even the biologists and chemistsmay do the same . Science follows the fashions even more than women . Some day , some very advanced research man will shake the world by rediscovering God . " " Sir James Jeans ! " said Mr. Wilde , nodding his head as if he knew Sir James Jeans intimately . " Sir James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why they have ever doubted the mind and the spirit , " said Felix , " I do n't know . Even physically man is sufficiently mysterious . Take steatopygia , for instance . " Mr. Wilde raised his eyebrows . " Steatopygia ? "  | " Yes  --  the accumulation of fat in the gluteal regions  --  the buttocksand thighs . It is particularly characteristic , of course , in the female Bushman-Hottentot , and is absent for the most part in the higher apes and monkeys and in civilized man , but we occasionally come across it , and why ? What does it mean ? What does it imply ? Can you explain that ? " " I certainly can not , " said Mr. Wilde fervently , " although I have often wondered . " The head Fate knocked , and entered with a couple of large red cardboard envelopes , tied with black ribbons . Mr. Wilde nodded . " Thank you , Miss Stearns . Would you put them here on the desk beside me . You need not wait . There 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cardboard envelopes and took out several documents and glanced at them . He sighed and raised his head and grimaced at Felix . " I have just had , " he said , " if I may say so , one of the most fascinating conversations I have had in a long while . I hope we can continue it and , from time to time , enjoy others like it . I have always been told that the older you get , the more and more you arrange your life and the more leisure you have for contemplation and speculation . Where any one got that idea , I do n't know , except possibly in some Old Man 's Home . And I dare say that there they keep themselves busy quarrelling . As for myself , each year I find myself increasingly pressed and with less and less leisure , and each year I find less and less people interested in what I 'm interested in . The acceleration of the squirrel cage increases . But now  --  " he sighed "  --  much against my will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients waiting for me who will be very angry if I keep them too long . " He picked up one of the documents and , reaching across the desk , handed it to Felix . " This , " he said , " is your uncle 's will , and I shall read it to you , and give you a copy as soon as it is filed . I have been very busy , so it is not yet filed , but it will be immediately . It 's a very simple will save for the clause you already know . Your uncle has left you his entire estate . And here  --  " he handed Felix a sheaf of foolscap in a binding of blue paper  --  " is an inventory of that estate ; real , personal and financial . You will find all your securities and all your properties . You may want to glance over the inventory now , and you will , of course , study it at your leisure . " He looked up swiftly and grimaced . " It is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an extraordinary man . He had a genius for investment . He would have been many times a millionaire if he had cared to become one . As it is , deducting all expenses and taking account of some depreciated real estate , the common curse of Philadelphia , you should be in receipt of an income of upwards of fifty thousanda year . " Felix , the sheaf of foolscap in his hand , sat forward , his mouth open . " Fifty thou  --  ! " he said . Mr. Wilde nodded and grimaced . " Yes , fifty thousand . Not a bad nest egg , eh ? Your uncle was a great believer in power  --  legitimate operating companies , that is , not holding companies  --  especially in the less fully developed states , and I must say it paid him . " He sat back in his chair . " Your uncle , " he said , " was , as a matter of fact , a convinced believer in the steady , what might be called automatic , unheralded progress of this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he disagreed with practically all his friends , including myself , but I now wish I had followed his advice where my own investments were concerned . " A pained look crossed his face and then he screwed it up reflectively . " Possibly , " he admitted . " Possibly . Perhaps . Perhaps this country after all is so strong , so undeveloped , so fecund that it can take continued punishment and still go ahead . At all events , I can remember your uncle sitting just where you are sitting and saying While we 've been here  --  half an hour or so  --  this country has been making millions upon millions , and nobody can stop it , and hardly any one is aware of it , especially you professional and business men . ' He used to add that farmers were aware , of course , and any one else accustomed to growth . " Mr. Wilde nodded his head . " Yes , " he continued , " I can still hear him , sitting in the very chair in which you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . He would say , Daniel , since we 've been here we 've moved , have n't we , enormously ?  --  thousands of miles . We 're thousands of miles from where we started when I sat down here half an hour ago . And what 's more , both of us are hanging , head down , straight out into space . There 's nothing between us and Arcturus , or whatever it happens to be . ' " Mr. Wilde sighed again.  | " A very remarkable man , " he said . " A genius . One of his sayings was Sound investment is confidence in America . ' A pity , really , that he was so much more interested in books and pictures and travel . " " I do n't think that 's genius , " said Felix mildly . " I think that 's just common sense . Was n't it the elder Mr. Morgan who said , My son , never sell this country short ' ? " Mr. Wilde stared at him . " Why yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever hear that ? " " In The Reader 's Digest , " said Felix simply . " Hum ! " said Mr. Wilde , continuing to stare , one eyebrow slightly elevated . " Umm . . . . I thought you confined yourself exclusively to anthropology ? " " I do , " said Felix . " That is "  --  he hastily amended himself  --  " to anthropology of sorts . I do n't know exactly what I am . Sometimes I think I 'm a zoologist , sometimes I think I 'm a mammalogist , sometimes I think I 'm a primatologist , but ordinarily , I suppose , I 'm an anthropologist . Man embraces practically everything . " Mr. Wilde elevated both eyebrows . " Indeed he does , " he agreed . He was coming to the conclusion that it was not always easy to tell when this new client of his was being sly or merely innocent . Felix bent his head over the inventory of his securities and real estate  --  five or more foolscap pages held together with brass clips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one , names he had never heard before sprang out at him and accompanyingsymbols of whose meaning he had only the vaguest idea : " 5000 Sangaree Power , 1st Pf. 61/2 Crea . Pf . X. $7 ; 20,000 Deep River Elec . Co. 1st Pf. 5 ; 30,000 Pla . &; St. H. R. R. 1st Mtg. 4/ ; 10,000 Nat . Sec. 1st Series C ' 4 per cent bonds , " and so on , and so on . An entirely new and primitive language . Felix was ashamed of himself . He dared not ask what all this meant . He would have to find out in some less conspicuous way . He turned the pages until he came to the roll call of his real estate . He understood this better , but if anything his uneasiness and confusion grew . It was sardonic , was n't it , paradoxical , this profound , this widespreadownership for one who had always believed with Ruskin that the sign of growing maturity was the steady elimination ofp248hampering possessions , and who had said to himself " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's statement that " To know how to do without is to possess " ? He wished that he could visualize these streets ; the people who lived in these houses . The more he read , the more he felt depressed  --  this was a lot to own . Market , Chestnut , Cherry , Buttonwood , Quince , Green , Christian , Bainbridge , Carpenter , Quarry  --  street after street marched across the pages , each , Felix supposed , with its particular history , and its especial kinds of people living on it , and its title given it for some reason by now for the most part forgotten . Felix saw a great procession of houses and people . As far as he could make out , he was landlord of scores of properties , large and small , and a dozen or so business buildings . Unknown to any one but Mr. Wilde , he was a power in this huge sprawling city , affecting the lives of thousands who had never heard of him . And where he was n't the direct owner he held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am a steward , he thought . But for whom ? For what ? I will have to be a good one . " Mr. Wilde ? " Mr. Wilde looked up from the letter he was reading . " Yes ? " Felix glanced at the inventory . " Do I own all this ? " Mr. Wilde sighed . " I regret to say that you do . " He shook his head . " I would gladly dispose of every acre of Philadelphia real estate in your possession  --  save for the old house you are living in . I would sell it for fifty cents on the dollar if I could . I would compound the entire parcel for even less . Unfortunately , that is no longer in the cards . Your grandfather is responsible , not your uncle or myself . There was a time fifty years or so ago when city propertylooked pretty valuable . But you ca n't run a city , you know , and not live in it or vote in it . And you ca n't maintain values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rig prices . " Mr. Wilde emitted one of his mild and melancholy sighs . " You may have noticed , " he added , " that Philadelphia now looks like a set of badly broken teeth . " " Yes , " said Felix , " I have . "  |p249A  man of metaphor , he thought . " Or a dog 's dinner , " continued Mr. Wilde . " And it used to be one of the most comely cities in the world . A lovely city . A graciouscity . Big trees  --  beautiful houses . Every one living near each other and knowing each other . Some coherence . Some feeling that you had a reason for being where you were . " His face became somber . " I happen to be one of the culprits myself ; I do n't live in Philadelphia . " He thrust aside the correspondence at which he had been glancing . " And now , " he said briskly , " I have neglected to ask you if you are comfortable ; that , and a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felix was holding . " Put that in your pocket as well as the copy of your uncle 's will . I shall not read the latter to you as I intended . Read and study both at your leisure and ask me any questions that may occur to you . But now I must really see these clients of mine . I had hoped to clear the whole afternoon for you , but people telephoned . Let me see  --  " He turned to a desk calendar and consulted it . " I do n't want to take up too much of your time , or interfere with your work , but how about tomorrow at ten o'clock ? Would that suit you ? If so , I 'll see that I have nothing to do until noon . I 'll instruct Miss Stearns . " He smiled his pained grimace . " After all , it 's not every day that a young man is left a fortune and a magnificent residence . " " Ten o'clock , " said Felix . " Yes , that will be all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And in conclusion  --  " He reached toward the right-hand drawers of his desk and opened one of them and extracted a long envelope . " Here is the letter your uncle left you , the supplementary document I mentioned . It will explain many things , although I have not read it . I think , however , I know its general contents . Your uncle asked that you take your time , that you consider his requests and the position they put you in from every angle before you make up your mind definitely . Those were his exact words . But above all "  --  Mr. Wilde emphasized what he was saying  --  " he asked that you open this letter in the quiet of the library of 1205 Cassianut Street . Is that agreeable to you ? " " Certainly , " said Felix . " Very well , " said Mr. Wilde , and handed him the letter. fie relaxed in his chair as if he had finished his immediate duties and clasped his hands behind his head.  | " You found everything all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job , and the house shipshape ? " " Perfect , " sighed Felix . He got to his feet preparatory to leaving . " More than perfect . I 've already decided where I 'm going to work . Do you remember a sort of fourth story with a sloping roof ? It 's not exactly a garret . The walls are plastered and there are even open fireplaces . " Mr. Wilde nodded . " Yes , " he said . " I remember . " " I 've been looking them over , " said Felix , "  --  I mean the two rooms up there  --  and I can use them both , one for a study , one for a laboratory when I get around to the latter . The one I 'll use for a study is in the back and has a big north light  --  a row of dormer windows ; the one in front is a sort of storeroom , it 's filled with odds and ends and trunks and boxes . " Felix reflected . " Some day I 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They might be interesting . But I wo n't need a laboratory for a while  --  not till I finish my book . " Mr. Wilde had also got to his feet . He held out his hand . " Which I hope , " he said , " will be soon . " Felix was noncommital . " My wife , " said Mr. Wilde , " wants to meet you , naturally , just as speedily as may be . " He grimaced . " Outside of our ancient friendship with your family , you are of course a most intriguing figure to the female mind . Could you dine with us week after next ? Wednesday  --  Thursday ? Either of those days would be convenient . I 'll get my wife to drop you a note . And if you have n't a car yet , we 'll send in for you . " The lizards darted in and out of the spanieleyes . Mr. Wilde was holding Felix 's hand . He hesitated and then he spoke . " I have an idea , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect yourself in ordinary ways . Yes , I have an idea , although you may deceive some people . " The grimace became wider . " But as your trustee , I think I should warn you now of the dangers you are likely to incur from the other sex . " " The other sex ? " asked Felix . Mr. Wilde nodded soberly , although the lizards were busy . " Especially ambitious mothers . Philadelphia breeds extraordinarilyambitious mothers and extraordinarily fine and buxom girls . Both are strong and determined . "  |p251Felix  smiled and shook his head . " They do n't like me , " he said ; "  --  girls . " " Oh , do n't they ? " said Mr. Wilde . " Without intending to be so rude as to disagree with you , and I seriously doubt your statement , I have noticed that love has a curious way of following a bank account . " He raised his head and looked over Felix 's shoulder . " Anything I can do for you , Henry ? " Felix followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing in the doorway a tall and shining young man in a beautifully fitting tweed suit of gray herringbone . The gray suit accentuated the young man 's slim waist and broad shoulders . The young man had crisp blond hair and in the buttonhole of the gray suit was a white carnation ; he had opened the door and was holding the knob tentatively , in his other hand a sheaf of papers . " Why , yes , " he said , " Mr. Wilde  --  if you do n't mind . I wanted to ask you about this Hewlitt business . " " Very well , " said Mr. Wilde . " Just a moment . Henry  --  Mr. Armstead , this is Mr. Macalister . Mr. Felix Macalister . You have heard me speak of him . He has just arrived . " " How d'ye do ? " said the young man briefly , nodding and comingforward . He did not take Felix 's hand . He may be all right , thought Felix , but he has n't very good manners ; at least , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people had good manners , however , when they were thinking about themselves . " Good-bye , " said Mr. Wilde cordially . " We 'll talk some more about steatopygia. "  |p252FELIX  moved about the library absent-mindedly , but as if he were concentrating upon the room and its belongings ; recalling it and them from some time long in the past and regilding and resharpeninghis memories . Like a child he fingered various objects ; picking them up , looking at them , putting them down again : the little statue on the big table desk of the boy taking a thorn out of his foot ; an ashtray made of onyx ; a silver penholder ; a paperweight of carved crystal . Once he walked the length of the room , his hands in his trousers pockets , to the alcove of the bay window where the bookcases with their brown and crimson and dark green contents went up to the ceiling . He pushed aside meditatively one of the heavy saffron silk curtains screening the bay window  --  they were of the same shade and design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saxifrage Street . Saxifrage Street had not changed much . Most of the row of tiny boxlike brick houses had been torn down to make room for the extension of back buildings from the street beyond , and the latter , with only a window here and there , looked like the inner walls of a prison , but two of the boxlike houses were still standing , and Saxifrage Street itself was as narrow and sunless and apparentlymalodorous as ever . Felix wondered if the heads of the remaining households , and dejected households they must be , were by any chance two of " the muckers , " grown up , who years before at intervals had made his life miserable . He stood for five minutes at least staring down into Saxifrage Street , and then he walked back to the fireplace at the other end of the room where the high brass andirons and brass fender shone . Felix put a foot on the fender and with bent head peered at the unlit logs.  |p253At  five o'clock the old house was at its most stable . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the April afternoon most of the windows were open , the house was quiet . It was as if , having resisted sound all day long , it had stored up strength for the night . Felix peered at the logs . Strange , was n't it , that in looking over the inventory of his uncle 's real estate he had discovered that Saxifrage Street , or rather its houses , belonged to him ? He had never known that before . He had never known that Saxifrage Street was a possession of his family . He raised his head . On the wall to the right of the fireplace were several miniatures hung in their small ebony frames one above the other . At the top was the miniature of a lovely girl , a great aunt or something , her corn-colored hair parted in the middle and drawn down over her ears , her blue eyes wide and candid . A pity , thought Felix , for such a pretty girl to die . Here for the first time the corn-colored hair of his mother and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the blue-eyed girl was the miniature of Felix 's great-great-grandfather , the Felix Bartain who had built the house in 18o6 . A good deal of a man , this Felix Bartain , with his dark clever face , still markedly Gallic , and his blue tight-fitting coat of broadcloth , a high rolled collar coming out along the peaked shoulders , and his white stock . He had been a gallant fellow , this third Felix , and Felix had a vague idea that ever since , with a few exceptions , the family had traded upon the tradition of his gallantry . He had been the third generation removedfrom the original Felix who had arrived from France in 1720 , a botanist intent upon collecting herbs and making a fortune . The third Felix had as a young man , much against the wishes of his father the second Felix , a prosperous merchant , joined the Continental Army and had for a while been an aide-de-camp to General Washington . There had been citations and a decoration . And later on the third Felix had been much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city  --  in those days still a fairly young and fairly adventurous city . The third Felix had been a friend of Lafayette and Jefferson and even Thomas Paine  --  the last showed what sort of mettle he was ; and he had been equally a friend of Hamilton and Adams . And Felix 's mother had told him as a boy that there were numerous letters from Franklin and Madison and Livingstone , and a couple from the first Presidenthimself . As an elderly man , the third Felix had carried on a feud with Stephen Girard , also of French blood , but French blood at its coldest and most calculating . Felix turned away from the fireplace and walking to the table desk , pressed the switch of one of the high lamps in the shape of Corinthian columns . The light , soft because it was still dusk  --  a blue April dusk  --  made a swathe of gold in the room . Felix drew a chair up close to the desk and took out of his pocket the long envelope Mr. Wilde had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as finely formed , as deeply shaded , as Chinese ideograms . The letter was dated January 2 , 1938 , two and half months before Mr. Bartain 's death . " My dear Felix , " it began , " although I have not seen you since you were nine , I think I can address you as my dear Felix ' as after all you are my nephew and my heir . At least , you are the first and I trust , after reading this letter , you will consent to be the latter . " I shall not enlarge upon that odd and unbelievable state in which I shall be when your eyes first fall upon these sentences , although it is always a temptation to speculate . I shall simply say that although I am an old man , and know that I shall soon die , and although practically all my intimate friends are dead , and I have seen death often , I can not yet believe in it . None of us do , and yet it is the only thing save birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask consideration of you because I am dead . I will merely say that I shall be as helpless as the dead invariably are , despite a few legal restrictions I have tried to place upon you , and so about all I can actually ask of you is forbearance and the use of your imagination . " I have seen enough of the law to believe that if you really wish to do so , you can break the provisions of any will , not to mention any contract . Even faith with the dead is still a matter of a gentleman'sagreement . Perhaps in my case you can prove that I was insane . The line between sanity and insanity is narrow , and if a man has any character whatsoever he has repeatedly done things that the stupid , or in other words what are called the normal , consider mad . I have therefore , as I have said , little actual hold upon you save the impression this letter will make . "  |p255A  clever man , thought Felix . By the most subtle means he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way all through life no doubt . " I shall not , " the letter proceeded , " even descend to the depths of trying to play upon any residuum of superstitious respect , or fear , which I am sure that you , despite your scientific training , possess in common with all men . I shall not threaten you with my return , and I shall not breathe upon your neck . I should consider that the height of bad manners and poor sportsmanship . That respect , that fear , anyhow , have about reached their lowest ebb , although I doubt if ever they altogether vanish , and I look for a recrudescence . Death is still curious whenever a man has time to think about it . For the present , however , the world having lost temporarily its faith in life has , of necessity , largely lost its faith in death . The two go together . Death is no longer ceremonious and grave , but has become a matter of motor hearses and apartmentcemeteries instead of family plots or the graciousness of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , visit some day the burying plot of old Christ Church and then , afterwards , this city 's most fashionable cemetery , Laurel Hill , where I will now be lying . " ( At the bottom of the page was a footnote and asterisk : " Laurel Hill , not West Laurel Hill . The latter is respectable , but not fashionable . As a Philadelphian , you will be called upon to make these delicate discriminations . Even in death Philadelphians are exclusive . " ) " In Laurel Hill our best families lie in serried rows as forgotten and to all intents and purposes as anonymous as the crowded but lonely occupants of a ghostly Waldorf-Astoria . There is no inducementfor the antiquarian , for the gently curious seeking for that fine and necessary melancholy old churchyards bring . No one goes near Laurel Hill except for funerals , save the sentimental , drumming up a belief in their faithfulness , such as widows for a final look on the eve of remarriage . Steadily the world loses continuity , and Laurel Hill is an excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my firm conviction , especially hygienic . There is every opportunity for the more exclusive blood and bones of the city to seep slowly into the Schuylkill and so into the drinkingwater of those unwise enough to use it . As my old friend Jonathan Allen once remarked , One grows tired of drinking Cadwaladersand Biddies . '  | " But I ramble , and from now on I shall try to be more succinct , although they say garrulity is the privilege of age , and the privilege is especially dear when one perceives little more opportunity to exercise it . This is perhaps the last time I shall ever converse at length with any one . " And so at once I come to my point , or my several points . " In the first place , you will probably have asked yourself why you are my heir . The answer is simple . Both your Aunt Lydia , Mrs. Alexander Strong , and your Uncle Wirth have ample means of their own and fortunately both are childless . Your Uncle Wirth 's wife , Elizabeth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy coincidence if you consider justly and objectively the possibleparents , and although your Aunt Lydia is in many ways a fine woman , there is every indication that her offspring would have been headstrong , spoiled and quarrelsome . Her only son died in childhood shortly after the death of his father , a man whom I never liked . By circumstances therefore you are my only logical heir , but there is more to it than that , you are also the heir I would have selected . " It may astonish you , but I trust not displease you , to know that I have followed your career and behavior with considerable care , and as a result , although I have not seen you since you were a boy , I have a very fair idea of what you are like . I even have a couple of photographs of you , and although you are not handsome you are not physically a disgrace . The various teachers , employers , and even one or two of your companions , with whom I have at times corresponded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Felix raised his eyes from the closely written sheet and stared at the fireplace . For a moment , he was distinctly angry . He had an unhappy impression of having been followed all his life by a thickset man with a black moustache and a derby ; then he shrugged his shoulders . About the most useless emotion imaginable was anger with the dead . Besides , from what he was beginning to learn of his uncle , anger with him , alive or dead , was about as profitable as throwing pebbles at a cliff . He resumed his reading . " Their reports on the whole were excellent . You were brought up modestly  --  a rare advantage for one who some day is to inherit money . You are hardworking . You are ambitious . You are temperate . You are healthy . You are young and yet sufficiently mature.  |p257And  although I am not in the least interested in your chosen branch of research and consider it mostly nonsense , you have achieved in it considerable distinction . All in all , although no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you will be as satisfactory as any . " But why should I have exercised so much care ? you ask yourself . Why should I , an ancient bachelor on the brink of death , have so much concern ? Why did I not say to myself , as the majority do , After me the deluge ' ? The answer to that too is simple . " It was because I am gravely disturbed about things ; gravely disturbed about the way the world is going ; anxious , if I can , to insure one little eddy at least of common sense and resistance . It is about the only deep emotion I have left . Perhaps it is foolish for me to care so much about the future of the human race since shortly I will no longer be part of it , but the human race seems to me the only reasonably interesting experiment nature has made , and I should hate to see it go back to the saber-toothed tiger . Unpleasantas it is , the human race is the only phenomenon that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fantastic charade which is existence , the one shadow that has any real outline is , if you will forgive me the cliche  --  and possibly a mixed metaphor  --  ' the stream of life ' ; the variegated mystery , that is , which issues from the loins of men and women . The stream of life , but I hasten to add and underscore , the stream of life properly channelled . " I have lived longer than my allotted span . I have been almost everywhere . I have done , bad or good , practically everything . I have tasted every sensation , smelled every smell , looked at all things beautiful or ugly , and as a result I believe little , feel less , and becomeexcited not over four times a year , and then usually about food . . . . Boiled eggs properly done  --  they seldom are  --  seem to be my latest passion . But each day I live I become more set in the convictionsI have outlined above . " I do not know whence the stream of life flows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but of this I am sure , it is the only manifestation that has a trace of substance and meaning . Out of the cradle endlesslyrocking ' as our former neighbor , Walt Whitman , over in Camden , once put it . But I see more than he did . The cradle endlesslyrocking means little unless it rocks with purpose and consciousrhythm . Otherwise , although to blind nature biologic neces- sity may be of consequence , the cradle endlessly rocking so far as the future is concerned is no more than a muddy flood , if you will forgive again a mixed figure of speech . " The cradle endlessly rocking , unless it is guided by wisdom , means no more than that some male has mounted a female and after nine months a not too beautiful replica has emerged . Unless consciously channelled , the stream of life will continue to exhibit no more point , except for occasional chance , than the roe of the shad . Not as much . Shad roe properly broiled is in the spring a delicious dish and especially good in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and study its cooking . As a rule , it is overdone or the reverse . But to return to my contention . Man then is the only creature that can put a point to anything ; the only manifestationof nature gifted with hindsight , foresight , and a faint desire to construct the present . Strange , is n't it , that he has shown so little interest in properly channelling the stream of life which is the beginning of everything ? " If a man selected a wife with the care with which he selects a horse , and a woman selected a husband with the care with which she selects a dress , a start might be made . Meanwhile , what machineryhave we ? A primitive one , I admit , but one that has in various ages worked pretty well ; in the ages , that is , when any one paid any attention to it ; I am referring to the family . " If you can produce a good strain , then the next step is to use every means to keep it going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rejuvenate it . All wise men have agreed to this . " I am , for example , irrevocably opposed to divorce , save under the most exceptional circumstances , not because I am illiberal or unaware of the exquisite , if temporary , pleasure of grazing in new pastures , but because divorce is anarchy  --  nihilism  --  and if you repudiatethe smallest but most important of social contracts , who will keep the larger ? And so on ad infinitum . In short , it seems to me the world is suffering from that most devastating of diseases , chronic and growing irresponsibility ; the intention to make your bed wherever the fancy suits you and then not to lie in it . Now I know that beds can be extremely uncomfortable , but it seems to me better to try to reconstruct them than to abandon them at the first sign of hardness . " If beds are abandoned for the slightest whim , pretty soon thep259world will be so filled with abandoned beds that the entire social scenery will become bewildering and obstructed . One will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furthermore , too many will take to making pie-beds just for the fun of it . " Let me turn to a simile with which you should be familiar . I trust I am not misusing it . One of the smallest of physical units , unless I am mistaken , is the atom , which in its turn is composed of positive and negative electrons . What is the family , then , but an atom , and the male and female elements but the positive and negativeelectrons ? But we all know that exploding the atom is a pretty dangerous experiment . What then will happen if we keep on constantlyexploding the family ? " The Bartains originally were a typical , frugal , hardworking , thrifty and fecund Huguenot clan , stemming originally from Bordeaux . For a long while , for over a century , they held their heads high in this city and did their duty philoprogenitively . Now they have fallen on evil days . The race has almost run out . There is little left save property . You alone , by means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are in your middle thirties and so far have shown little inclination toward marriage . I trust before you are forty you will see your way toward indulgingin this useful , if not always pleasant , performance . Perhaps now that you are fairly secure your attitude will imperceptibly change , and above all I advise you not to be deceived by what is commonly called love . Look about calmly for some attractive , congenial , well-bred girl with hips sufficiently flexible for childbearing . Remember you are marrying a wife , a partner , a prospective mother , not an advertisement for bath salts . As for love , as commonlymisunderstood , if you feel an overwhelming desire at times for this fleeting mortification , your present income and position should enable you to partake of it sensibly without harm to any of your other relationships , that is , if you are discreet . Passion , however , and take the word of one who knows , is on the whole the cheapest trick nature plays for its own ruthless purposes , and has no more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the solidity of the family , than has a game of chess . Once more  --  channel yourself ; channel life ; channel your family . " And now to come to this house , in the library of which , and quietly , I trust you are reading this letter . "  |p26oFelix  raised his head and looked about him , and then resumed his reading . " A man needs symbols . Ideas by themselves are not warm enough or sufficiently arresting . So that is why the house , the home , has always been , once man emerged from barbarism , more than a mere shelter against the wind and the rain . Civilized man adorns his cave , makes neat and beautiful his shelter , plants flowers about it , so that it shall not only be an expression of himself and his breed , but a continuing symbol to remind him while he is alive , and after his death , to remind his descendants and others , that here was , and still should be , a decent pride and some withdrawal from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distracted world . " What does a good house say to you the moment you enter it ? " The family  --  the proper sort of family  --  is the symbol of man 's highest aims . The house is the symbol of the family . " I am in favor of the pioneering spirit at its best . It has done much for this country , spiritually as well as practically . But the pioneer spirit decayed or mishandled has made too many Americanshomeless , and so promoted much of our surprising degradation , public slovenliness , and violent crime . Too many of us are too little disciplined by the sense of place and home ; by the humbleness and gratitude implied in Cervantes ' words , Whom God loves , his house is sweet to him . ' And that is why I have made such a point , which at first must have seemed ridiculous and arbitrary to you , of your living in the house in which I hope you are now reading this letter . If the Bartains amount to anything , this house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tyrant , dear as tyranny is to the old who have few opportunities to exercise other vices . There is a codicilto my Will which Mr. Wilde is now instructed to read to you . It is a separate document from the Will itself . " It is impossible to predict the future , and I have no intention of hampering you too much with the mortmain of my desires . It may well be that circumstances may become such that it would be unwise , and a contradiction of my real intentions , for you to continue to hold 1205 Cassianut Street . Should this be so , I have provided that if eventually in the opinion of Mr. Wilde , or , in case of his death , of the executor he has the power to appoint , it is clearly detrimental to the estate to continue to hold the property ,  |p261you  will be at liberty to dispose of it but solely upon these conditions ; that the price of the property , taxes , etc. , deducted , shall be yours , plus enough of my estate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that you shall then leave the city just as now I am calling you back to it . " I continue to reach out the mortmain , do n't I ? I continue to attempt to mortgage your future . Forgive me , and by now you must be heartily sick of it , but I have my reasons and they all fit logically into my general scheme . " In case you should deeply wish , or find it necessary to sell the house which your great-great-grandfather built , and in which five generations  --  counting you  --  will have lived , it seems to me better and more dignified to close the local family books entirely ; to write off the whole transaction to profit and loss . I do not wish to leave you penniless , nor , on the other hand , do I wish you to becomepart of the rootless , meaningless suburban existence to which most of the children and grandchildren of the friends I once had have descended . With what will be yours , go back , or go out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps my little attempt to stem the tide is useless . Perhaps Philadelphia , for reasonstoo numerous to mention , is a dying city , although even if it is , I do not care to leave the bulk of my fortune outside the place with which for so long our family has been identified . I trust , however , that none of this will happen , and that you will continue to live in 1205 Cassianut Street all your life and leave it , despite the vicissitudes of Philadelphia real estate , to the hypothetical children of which I have spoken . " And now for two final points . If you have read thus far you have been very patient and so bear with me a trifle longer . " Undoubtedly by now you will have asked yourself somewhat scornfully why I am burdening you with this homily when I myselfam such a vulnerable exponent of the exact opposite . How dare I , a bachelor of my age , advise you to marry and leave an heir ? I can only say that frequently by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no longer in a position to do it . Few men achieve wisdom before sixty , and by then as a rule their only outlet is philosophy . During the past fifteen years I have many times contemplatedmarrying any healthy not overintelligent young woman willing to marry a man of my age , solely for the purpose of con- tinuing our breed , but invariably the price seemed too high . Unfortunately , for forty-five years I had trained myself to the exact opposite ; toward what I may justly call an almost too delicate Catholicism . I may say frankly that I began to develop what became an exquisite taste in this direction at the tender age of sixteen due to the presence in the house  --  the one in which you are now sitting  --  of a French governess whom your grandmother had mistakenlyintroduced for the purpose of instructing your Aunt Lydia , not me , in her civilized tongue . She was a delicious young creature , far beyond her station . She did well , extremely so , I am glad to report , upon her return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old lady , noted for her piety . I have been instrumental in some of her contributions to the church . " Alas , the same paradoxical nemesis is likely to overtake connoisseurshipin wines and foods . By the time a man has tasted enough vintages and known enough chefs and headwaiters to be expert , he has usually reached the age where he must eat the most simple of foods and abjure alcohol entirely . The latter , however , has worked out to your advantage . You will find that I have left you a most excellent wine cellar . Mrs. Ross has the key . No great wines , perhaps  --  I drank those in my fifties and during Prohibition  --  but some extremely solid Burgundies and Bordeauxs , red and white , and some more than passable Cotes-du-Rhone ; Nuits-St . George , for instance ; Chateau Margaux ; Hermitage La Chapelle ; and so on . This in addition to plenty of madeira , brandy and champagne . There is also a rack of respectable Moselle , good for warm weather . " In conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a purely selfish standpoint , there are only two , your Aunt Lydia and your Uncle Wirth . I dare say as a matter of manners and from natural curiosity you will wish to call upon them . I can only advise you to exercise care where your Uncle Wirth is concerned . Your Aunt Lydia is an entertaining and still charming woman , although given to snuffling a little over her food and likely in certain moods to drink three cocktails before dinner where a person of her temperament and blood pressure should drink only one . She took up cocktails too late in life , anyhow . I regret to say that her occasional overindulgence increases her contempt for men , due to her opinion of her late husband , and her desire forp263argument . Outside of this , she is a civilized person , well worth seeingsomething of , and her house on upper Delancey Street  --  in happierdays it was called Delancey Place  --  is an excellent example of what the best Philadelphia houses once were , and still could be if Philadelphia had any sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you find such houses as the few old houses left in Philadelphia . They have an indescribable dignity and quiet rightness . A shining well-bred comfort , like elderly gentlemen and ladies with sweet breaths who bathe often . ( I.e. , most of them do n't . ) For your guidance , your aunt is at her best around five in the afternoon . As for your Uncle Wirth , it is difficult to picture him except vulgarly . I have not spoken to him for ten years . " He has become a Falstaff without Falstaff 's wit ; a mere bag of guts , ' almost inarticulate and completely egg-shaped . He seldom appears before dusk , and then shuffles along like some grotesque broken-winged bat that can not leave the earth . In all the world I have seen no other figure like him . Finally , for some extraordinary reason , he has become a miser . But after all , he too is old and will before long be gathered to that peculiar limbo reserved for those who overeat , overdrink , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so possibly you will leave a card upon him . " With that I say good-bye . I will not sign myself affectionately for I do not know you and might not like you if I did , but naturally I wish you all the luck and contentment possible in a world in which there is too little of either . " Your Uncle , " Felix Rhees Bartain . " P.S. Strange to say good-bye ' when you know that death holds the pen for the punctuation mark . One wishes that the sound were audible and had no ending . " Felix raised his head thoughtfully in the dusk , for it was dark now and only the tall lamp made any illumination.  | " MR . WILDE ? " Felix was shy . " Yes ? " Felix leaned forward earnestly . " Are these houses of mine  --  What sort of houses are they , anyway ? I mean , the poorer sort of ones . I notice that some of them rent for fifteen dollars a month . They ca n't " Mr. Wilde , sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felix attentively , spread his hands out , palms upward , in a deprecating gesture . " My dear boy , how should I know ? I am not a real-estate man . Goodman and Hart , our agents , are supposed to be the best in town . They have charge of all that . It is merely my duty to receive the rents and turn them over to you . Should there be non-rentals , or matters of that kind , of course I look into them to some extent , but beyond that  --  " He put the tips of his fingers under his nose and leaned forward a little , his elbows on the arms of his chair . His voice was conciliatory . " Felix  --  you do n't mind my calling you that , do you ? I shall sooner or later  --  well then , my dear Felix , listen to me . I know you very slightly . I saw you yesterday afternoon for the first time , but we lawyers get to be fairly good judges of character . You are , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You feel a trusteeship for all you own . You have , some time betweenyesterday afternoon and this morning , looked over the inventoryof your uncle 's estate which I gave you . You are worried and bewildered . Do you propose to take charge of this large and ramified inheritance personally ? " Felix was uncertain . He stared for a moment over Mr. Wilde 's shoulder at the pano/rama of the city , cool blue and green in the April morning . The big window back of Mr. Wilde was open . " Why , I don't. know , " he said . Mr. Wilde shook his head . " Because if you do , " he continued , " you 'll have no time for anything else . You 'll have to abandon your book , my dear boy , and also anthropology . Oh no , Felix . " He shook his head again . " You have been left a great estate . It is my job to supervise it ; it is the job of others to look after the details . It is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go about your legitimate business , with a certain amount of intelligent knowledge of what you have , of course , and keeping in close touch with me . The world is no longer the parochial and personal affair it once was . A man 's interestsare scattered from here to Tierra del Fuego . What do you know , for instance , of the inner workings of the various companiesin which you have stocks and bonds ? A man is no longer his brother 's keeper . He can not be . It is physically impossible . " He studied Felix with questioning spaniel eyes for a moment and then leaned forward . " Look here , " he said , " you are not by any chance a reformer , are you ? " Felix stared at him and then laughed . " I do n't know . I have no idea what I am . I only arrived yesteray . But Mr. Wilde was grave . " You can not be , " he said decisively . " Not with your blood  --  I shall warn you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't pay , especially in this city . It 'll break your heart and you 'll accomplish nothing . No single personis responsible , Felix . The conditions that are beginning to worry you  --  and they have worried hundreds of others  --  are a slow growth and began generations ago . We merely inherit them and do the best we can . To clean them up would require a strength greater than Hercules ' . And people wo n't like you if you become a fanatic on the subject . There is nothing Philadelphians deprecate more than moral earnestness ; it 's bad form . " Mr. Wilde relaxed and sat back in his swivel chair . " If I were you , " he advised , " I 'd leave things severely alone and be satisfied that Goodman and Hart seem to be able to rent even the worst of your houses . That 's better than most . " Felix raised his head and stared again at the panorama of the city.  | " Mr. Wilde , " he said , " do you know Saxifrage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilde . " I believe you own two houses there , but I have never seen them . " Felix lowered his eyes and his mouth was grim . Abruptly he took off his spectacles , wiped them with his handkerchief and put them in the breast pocket of his coat . " I 've got to get over the habit of wearing those , " he said , as if to himself , " I really see much better without them . . . . Saxifrage Street ? Why , it 's directly back of where I live . I can look down on it from the bay window of my library . " " Oh yes , " said Mr. Wilde . " I remember it now . " He opened a drawer of his desk . " I have here , " he said , his voice recapturing its interest , " a list of the institutions social and charitable and so on to which your uncle belonged and in which he wished you to continuemembership . This seems to me as good a time as any to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describe some of these organizationsto you in a general way ? " " Why yes , " said Felix , and drew his chair nearer to the desk . Mr. Wilde consulted the paper before him . His voice became slightly acidulous . " First and foremost , of course , " he said , " is the Museum of Cultural Antiquity ; what might be called your rival heir . " He looked up at Felix and the lizards darted in and out of his eyes . " The Museum of Cultural Antiquity ! " he repeated softly . " It is not , " he said , returning to the list , " the duty of a trustee to comment upon the predilections and hobbies of his clients , particularlywhen they are , or have been , intimate friends , but I may say in passing that the Museum of Cultural Antiquity was the one break in the otherwise extraordinarily reasonable attitude of a remarkable man . Why anybody should want to collect , especially in troubled times like these , second-hand tear-bottles and Egyptian mummies is beyond me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ museum five thousand a year and was a leading director , and so I think as a mere matter of courtesy you should do and be the same . I am glad to say that his other donations were not by any means as large , otherwise you would have nothing to live on . " " Very well , " agreed Felix . " What 's the Museum of Cultural Antiquity like ? " " A morgue , " said Mr. Wilde briefly , without raising his head.  | " A very handsome morgue built in imitation of some temple at Memphis . Perhaps I am unduly prejudiced because I dislike so intenselymost of the directors . It is my private opinion that they are chosen for their rudeness and their habit of making queer sounds when not otherwise occupied . During their monthly meetings , which you will attend , while they are all locked up together , for a couple of hours the whole city takes on a pleasanter atmosphere . But I recommend their annual dinners  --  the food is superb , although I should hesitate a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to obtain possession of your uncle 's money . I am being facetious , of course . " " Thank you , " said Felix politely . Mr. Wilde narrowed his eyes at the ceiling . " You will discover , " he said in parenthesis , " that a number of the more aristocratic and so , self-assured Philadelphians , as they grow older not only indulge in such idiosyncrasies as occasionally talking to themselves and emitting unexpected exclamations , but even go in for more intimate expressions of their personalities . Do not be alarmed . Unless I have misread my history , it is typical of the flowering of a civilization . I have merely to mention Louis the XIVth and his court . Only the insecure are refined . " He picked up the list and studied it once more . " Next , " he resumed , " are a number of hospitals and other charitableorganizations of which your uncle was a patron or director . I shall not enumerate them . They need no explanation . Their names and the amount of your uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them The Athenaeum and that is eminently worth your attention  --  a lovely old library down on Sixth Street opposite Washington Square . The wisteria vine in its back garden in the spring is worth in itself the two shares your family have always owned . A charming place . I would even use it , which very few of its members do . And an excellent and delightful annual luncheon in the spring , too  --  ladies , I never miss it . Yes  --  the Athenaeum has eminent character and atmosphere . Strange , is n't it , that a library should be regarded as a charitable institution ? And now  --  let 's see . The Orchestra , of course . Two seats on Friday  --  matinees , and a directorship and a donation , large ; and the opera  --  an opulent and unwieldy and drafty proscenium box . I have suffered in it many times in your uncle 's company . You might get rid of that and trade it in for a parquet box . You will be a director of the opera too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that may need explanation . " He looked up at Felix and grimaced . " And you had best ask me about them now , and exhaustively , because I am not originally a Philadelphian and so your ignorance may not cause you completely to lose standing in my eyes . " Mr. Wilde put his head on one side and regarded Felix steadily . " I do not like to insultyou , " he said , " but  --  but do you know what the Assemblies are ? " Felix frowned . " I 've heard of them , " he said vaguely . " They 're parties , are n't they ? " ? " My dear fellow ! " Mr. Wilde sighed . " My dear fellow  --  parties ! I am so glad no one else is in this room . " He sighed again . " Parties ! The next thing you know you 'll be calling them dances . Felix , it is possible to live in Philadelphia and not belong to the Assemblies , in fact , somewhere around one million , four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million and a half do . That is , they exist in a strange outer land of shadows . But it is not possible to live in Philadelphia and display the lighthearted ignorance which you have just exhibited . Even the news vendor down here on the corner would rebuke you . " The lizards gleamed in the spaniel eyes . " We Philadelphians are a kindly folk with a sense of humor , but some things are sacred to us , although , as I have said , I have only been here myself for four decades or so and therefore can hardly call myself a Philadelphian . " Mr. Wilde 's voice became descriptive . " Felix , the Assemblies are the oldest and most stately balls in America . They are not parties , they are balls . And the attendant ceremony , from the curtseying of the women who are present to the bowing of the men before the line of receiving patronesses , is equalled only by the etiquette of the Court of St. James 's . Philadelphians  --  someof the more mature ones  --  may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they get together they 're magnificent . There are two Assemblies during the winter , and they are the most historic gatherings of the kind in the country . Only the St. Cecilia in Charleston approaches them . They were founded somewhere around 1740 and so were mature even when Lord Howe occupied the city , and he and his officers werep269glad to be asked . " Mr. Wilde 's voice deepened . " They are the only things , " he added , " except our skyscrapers , that impress visiting Englishmen . Why not ? They 're older than most of the English aristocracy . " He grimaced . " I have the enthusiasm , " he commented , " of the non-resident who was taken in because of his wife . The Assemblies are harder to enter than Noah 's Ark unless you 're so rich that even Philadelphians feel helpless . Also , if you get a divorce , automatically your name disappears from the list . " He was thoughtful . " I am afraid , " he concluded , " that this regulation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that , have I answered your question ? " " Yes , " said Felix , " thoroughly . " " I am glad , " said Mr. Wilde , " and I hope you will never make a similar break . And now we have left only The Franklin Institute , a splendid museum and laboratory of the physical sciences in which you will without doubt take an immense interest . And the Academy of the Fine Arts ; and the Pennsylvania Historical Society  --  excellent  --  ; and the Library Company of Philadelphia  --  ' Mr. Franklin 's Library ' they call it , because he founded it . The oldest circulating library in America , 1731 ; an outcome of the Junto Club . To all those you will wish to belong , I suppose , in a modest fashion . Finally , we come to the three clubs of which your uncle was a member and which , I have no hesitation in saying , were , although he seldom used them , of great importance in his life . That is to say , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves , I think it unnecessary . I refer to the Union League . The Civil War , after all , was fought some time ago . " " Not where I come from , " suggested Felix . Mr. Wilde raised his head and actually smiled . " No  --  No , that is what I 've heard , but up here they are already beginning to confuse it with the CIO . Well  --  let us see then . To start with , there 's the Negus ; an historic and exclusive organizationup the Schuylkill River devoted to the culinary arts . Your uncle was very fond of that . And , of course , the Pastorius , if I may say so , the best of the city clubs . I am modest because I happen to be a member myself . Third , the Union League once more , which , as I have said , I suggest you resign from unless you feel very strongly about Mr. Hoover , which I do not . The restaurant is excellent , but the membership is heterogeneous and the nudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastily , " the paintings . Yes , unless you especially wish as a matter of tradition to retain all your uncle 's connections , as your trustee I would advise you to resign from the Union League . " He cocked an eyebrow at Felix . " I am assuming of course that you are a Republican . You are , naturally ? " Felix blushed and stammered ; he did not know why . " What ? " he asked in order to gain time . " A Republican ? " I have , thought Felix shamefacedly , a great deal of St. Peter in me . He summoned his courage . " I never have been , " he admitted reluctantly . And then he added boldly , " I 'm a Democrat . " For the first time Mr. Wilde was definitely somber . He consideredFelix soberly . " Well , " he concluded , " it 's all right  --  I 'm liberal minded myself , but just on general principles , I would n't mention it too much . That is , not at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saves you a large initiation fee . You are not eligible for the Union League . And now , my dear boy , I 'm not going to keep you any longer . I 've kept you long enough , and even the most necessary of information , as , despite my occasional badinage , I believe this to be , becomestiresome if there is too much of it at one time . You are going to reside in an interesting city . A city of many highways and byways and much mythology . I will do my best to help you , but suppose I reserve the rest of what I have to say for another occasion . You are going to dine with us week after next , although I hope to see you before then . Umm  --  let me think . This week I am afraid I have a luncheon engagement every day . Next week I shall be in New York practically all the time . How about lunching with me at the Pastorius two weeks from this Friday ? Friday is a good day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can chat comfortably and take our time . That suit you ? You have no other engagement ? If you have n't , I shall put it down . " Felix grinned . " Mr. Wilde , I know exactly three people in this city so far  --  no , four , counting your junior partner to whom you introduced me yesterday . I know you , Mrs. Ross , James Peace , my colored boy I brought with me , and --  ? "  | " Henry Armstead ? " asked Mr. Wilde . " Yes  --  Henry Armstead , but I do n't know him very well . I should be delighted to lunch with you Friday two weeks . I have no other engagements . " Mr. Wilde grimaced . It was necessary , Felix reminded himself once more , constantly to keep in mind that this was a smile . " So you think , " said Mr. Wilde sardonically . " So you think . As soon as people know you are in town , you 'll be overwhelmed . The competition is great . Friday two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is up at the Pastorius Club , just as it is up for the Negus . " " My name is up at the Pastorius Club ? " exclaimed Felix . " And at the Negus ? " Mr. Wilde nodded . " Certainly . I took the liberty of doing that . It will be long enough as it is before you are admitted . In your case , of course , it is largely a matter of form and will remain so unless in the meantimeyou turn Socialist or throw a glass at some one , but it is just as well to take time by the forelock . When you lunch with me , I shall see that the Admissions Committee  --  most of it , at least  --  is there also so that it can look you over afterwards . " Felix reached hastily into his breast pocket and put on his spectacles . This time Mr. Wilde 's grimace was almost what it was supposedto be . " Do n't worry , " he said soothingly . " They 're not bad fellows . They want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , even the Pastorius . The standards are not as high as one would like to believe . For generations your family has belonged . They know all about you . Your Uncle Wirth is still a member . " He hesitated and cleared his throat . " Although that is hardly a recommendation . However , it will not count against you . Only , do n't call hounds dogs ' to Butterworth  --  he 's the chairman of the Committee and a hunting man ; and do n't defend the President to Hammersley  --  he 's a short , red-faced little man . I 'll point him out to you . Hammersley is a banker and prejudiced . He was almost indicted three years ago . Otherwise , you 'll get along . As a matter of fact , yes ' and no ' with a smile is the best attitude . Once admitted , you can misbehave pretty much as you like . It 's like everything else , including marriage , a member has privileges . "  |p272Felix  had not been listening to the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the arms of his chair , his eyes narrowedbehind his spectacles , studying Mr. Wilde intently . Now he said again , " Mr. Wilde ? " " Yes ? " " Mr. Wilde , I 've been thinking . May I ask a favor of you ? " Mr. Wilde grimaced . " It depends what it is . " " Well , it 's this . Mr. Wilde , I 'm a complete stranger in this city and I 've never before in all my life owned a stock or a bond or an acre of real estate . I 'm like a crow  --  I ca n't count above five . Besides , we 're both professional men , you and I , and not only are professional men busier than most  --  their work is never done even when they 're sleeping  --  but they 're supposed to be experts along their particular lines . Often they are n't , but that 's the supposition . For instance , you 're a lawyer , I 'm a scientist . " Felix 's manner becameeasier and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You look after my stocks and bonds and my property  --  so far as the income of the last is concerned  --  and , if ever the occasion should arise , I 'll advise you about men or , if necessary , monkeys . Is that all right ? Will you agree to that ? I 'll follow your advice because you 're an expert . I wo n't guarantee that about the condition of my properties or the tenants I may have , that 's a different matter , and I may look into it , but I 'll guarantee it about the financial end of things . " He grinned shyly . " And also the social . After all , whom can you trust if you ca n't trust an expert ? And if there is n't mutual trust the world ca n't proceed . As you have justly said , nowadays there is too much for one man to know everything . Suppose , for example , I had to know all about medicine before consulting a doctor . Meanwhile , I 'll do my best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will even to going to the Assemblies . " He took his glasses off , continuing to smile at Mr. Wilde , his blue eyes earnest . The spaniel eyes widened into his . " Yes , " said Mr. Wilde thoughtfully and looked at the wall behindFelix ; then he looked back . " Yes , " he repeated softly , and nodded . For a moment he was silent and then he said , " You 're an astonishing young man , are n't you ? And I must admit disarming . You do n't believe in caveat emptor , do you ? No , I have no doubtp273there is little of it in your life , and , as a matter of fact , you 're correct . " He was silent once more before he resumed the thread of his discourse . " Caveat emptor , " he continued broodingly . " It 's a rotten attitudeand a stupid one . Suppose , for example , I were to sell innocent people inferior carnations ? Exactly . There 's no more reason why you should n't trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should n't trust , as you say , your doctor or your minister . Not one bit . Even the American shopkeeper , and to his great advantage , has learned better . The world indeed goes to pieces unless there 's mutual respect and trust . And that 's what 's happening now . " He lowered his eyes to his desk , his chin resting on his beautiful foulard tie . " As a matter of fact , " he concluded , " every citizen takes an oath , too , does n't he ? We all take some sort of oath . There are around a million lawyers in this country . Suppose every one of them decided to work only toward justice and truth . Supposeevery one of them decided to regard the law as the decent doctorregards medicine . What a change it would make . And suppose every citizen lived up to his oath of citizenship . What a wonderful country this would be . Suppose , in short , we all formed ourselves into guilds of honesty and citizenship ; trade unions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waistcoat pocket and took out his watch . " Good gracious , " he exclaimed and jumped to his feet . " My boy , if you and I do n't limit our conversations , pretty soon we 'll be doing nothing else . I 'll see you shortly , of course . In all this talk I have taken it for granted , naturally , that you have accepted permanently the provisions of your uncle 's will . " " Permanently ? " said Felix . " Yes  --  permanently . " " That 's a big word , " said Felix . " But  --  once more , I 'll do my best . " , He took Mr. Wilde 's hand . The slim almost fleshless hand felt warm for the first time . It was a coincidence that Felix , walking home , turning over in his mind Mr. Wilde 's dictum that the world was now too large for any man to be his brother 's keeper , in his ears the voices ofp274newsboys calling the early afternoon edition of the world 's growingconfusion , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of Twelfth and Cassianut Streets and had ascended the marble steps leading to his house , and had stooped down to insert his latchkey ; then he had straightened up and looked over his shoulder at the hurrying crowds . The corner of Twelfth and Cassianut Streets was at its busiest . Felix had had almost to push his way through the clerks and stenographers intent upon luncheon ; he had been thinking what a strange beast a crowd was , no wonder it had been called hydra-headed . And then , with the gasping suddenness with which such things happen , the man died . There on the corner diagonally across from Felix , in the bright sunshine of noon . Felix had never seen a man die that way before , although thousandsmust die that way every hour . And it seemed shockingly out of place and badly timed , as if a cog had slipped in a machine or into the trotting trochaic rhythm of the crowd a grave and halting iambic foot had been introduced . The man had been hurrying along like every one else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to his heart , and had slumped into the doorway of a shop . He lay there , his head back , in the casual broken abandon of death . Felix could see him clearly ; a youngish man , neatly dressed , clean shaven , the sort of man who you were sure had a wife and two small children . Felix , despite his hesitations , reacted swiftly in crises and he was halfway down the steps before he realized that he would only be in the way . He saw the traffic policeman at the intersectionhalt the traffic in both directions and run to the man 's side , and in a moment another policeman was there , and the traffic policeman had turned in an ambulance call and gone back to his post . Once more the trolleys and cars on Twelfth Street clanged and stuttered and slithered past , and the motorman of the waiting Cassianut Street trolley turned his head , his hands on the controls , and stared at the dead man indifferently . By this time a small crowd had gathered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his large face expressionless , was holding the crowd back so that it formed a half-circle . But the vast majority of the hurrying crowd had not noticed the incident or , if it had , did not pause.  |p275In  the doorway , sprawled out , indifferent to all manners and conventions , was the body of the man . There was nothing that Felix could do . He hesitated , and then reascendedhis steps and , opening the door , entered the vestibule . The vestibule seemed cool and private . As he opened the door beyond , the inner door , he heard the siren of the ambulance . It seemed dreadful that a man should die that way , so much alone and yet so publicly . There should be some lonely pomp and private circumstance about death ; some final dignity . Here for a brief moment there had come a great visitor , and so far as the crowd was concerned a third-rate politician or a motion-picture star would have proved more impressive . Of the crowd , only a score or more had even heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot that man . In the months to follow , so marked by mass movements , by mass death , by massed horror , he often saw the solitary figure , aloof and casual ; so abruptly for a moment an individual . But by golly , these people were individuals too  --  these millions of homeless and destroyed . A thousand Poles killed ! Twenty Czech students shot ! Five hundred Chinese bombed ! Austrian Jews commitsuicide ! . . . They were men and women ; people . They had blood in their veins , hair on their bellies ; breasts , the strange instrumentsof birth . They had fingernails . They thought , wept , agonized , and sweated . They smelled the air and liked it . . . . Felix went up to the library . It was twenty minutes to one . For awhile he walked up and down the length of the room , his eyes searching the floor , his hands in the pockets of his trousers , held high so that the vent at the back of his coat was widely parted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window where his grandfather 's books were . He looked up at them absentmindedly . He would have to get the figure of that man out of his mind . His glance swept the nearest shelves . He saw various titles he remembered , and then he paused and with a little smile took out a thick volume , Balzac 's Droll Tales . He turned to the story of the chatelaine and the amorous page . There she was , just as he had seen her twenty-six years before , lying back in her high chair pretending to be asleep , her skirts above her knees , the page at her feet . Poor page , poor chatelaine ! All their desires six hundred years burned out !  | The library was still ; the sun , going over to the west , had left it and it was in warm shadow . Felix raised his head abruptly and looked toward the distant fireplace . A feeling of guilt , like a faint coldness at the back of his neck , had crept over him . Out of the corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his grandfather.  |p277What  comfort can the vortices of Descartes give to a man who has whirlwinds in his bowels ?

They have immense endurance ; a dogged intention to survive , but they 're overstretched . In their unconscious minds are too many centuries of agony and shame . There 's none of the childish worthwhileenthusiasms of other races . They 're like violin strings that have been played upon too much . " You 're an ardent sort of person , are n't you ? " Mr. Disola had just been saying abruptly but softly . " You 'll go all out for something that interests you , and you wo n't turn traitor to it , either . Is that right ?

And the German is mystic , but the Scotch purifies it . German mysticism is a dreadful thing unless there 's something to purify it and make it lucid . " Mr. Disola picked up a pencil , carefully sharpened , and turned it around in his fingers . He began to speak as if addressingit . " You see , " he said , " I have almost everything except faithfulnessand enthusiasm . That is , I have enthusiasm in the beginning , but I 'm easily discouraged , I easily fall back . " He looked at Mavis sideways , the glimmer of a smile in his eyes . " I have n't been trained to faithfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for my own skin . I 've been trained not to believe in things , and what I need now is a sort of defense against myself , a sort of super-adjutant ; an alter ego but one who will supply what I have n't got .

I have an idea , I discuss it with you , you think it over and add to it and hand it back ; it grows in my mind , and so on . Sort of a pyramid . That 's the way big things are done . " Unexpectedly there was a flame in the depths of the dark eyes . " You see , " said Mr. Disola , " for the first time in my life I 'm really going to do something I like . Something I 've never had the chance to do before . " He smiled faintly . " And I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of it and tell me I 'm crazy . " He narrowed his eyes . " What do you think ?

" He looked at Mavis anxiously . " You 'll kick me in the seat of the pants if necessary ? " The words sounded strange coming from the curved mournful mouth , said in the precise silken voice . Mavis laughed . " I 'll do my best . "  | " You 've quite a lovely way of speaking , " said Mr. Disola adventitiously . " Especially when you 're moved  --  your low notes .

It would be dreadful , would n't it , always to be on your guard lest somebody insult you for something over which you had no control ? Mavis reconstructed her first sight of the office in which she and Mr. Disola were sitting . The priceless dark Regency chairs and bookcases and couch . The dove-gray painted walls with here and there a water color . The thick rugs of mild blue on the polished floor . Mr. Disola had shown her his collection of china in a high cabinet with glass doors . " I change it every week , " he said . " I like to take the pieces out and look at them  --  feel them . Run my fingers over them . It rests you when you 're tired . Ever feel old china ? It 's supposed not to take on any feeling , but it does . Touch , " he added lingeringly , and Mavis felt suddenly as if his hands were defining her , " is the most satisfactory of all the senses . " His mouth closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurance of possession . I bring new pieces in from the country every week and take back what I have here . " He turned away from the cabinet and walked toward his desk . " I collect glass as well , " he said . " There 's nothing more soberingand yet absurd than the beauty and ingenuity the human race has expended on receptacles merely to hold food and drink . It 's an example of the general insanity . Eat and drink beautifully in order to belch afterwards . " He paused as if collecting his memories . " You see , " he explained , " I 've had to make a living ever since I left college  --  Harvard . In fact , I 've had to make a living ever since I can remember . Sometimes it was n't nice . At Harvard I worked my way through  --  waited on tables , stoked furnaces , cut grass . Then for two years I lived with a rich old woman to get my doctor 's degree , and when I say lived , I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I was more than that . That was n't nice either . I specialized in art and archeology , but when I got through no one wanted me except a couple of miserable little institutions that hardly give you enough to pay your board . That was just about the time people were beginning to think up excusesnot to hire Jews . So I determined I 'd fool ' em ; I 'd make a living , and a good one . " He looked down at the floor and then up . " You can always make a living , " he said quietly , " and a good one , by finding out what people are ashamed of and then selling it to them . " Suddenly he looked at Mavis , his eyes narrowed . " But now at last I can do what I 've always wanted to do . " He jerked his head backwards toward the door . " I 've gone through a lot of muck , and I 'll continue to go through it . Those two things along the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want ; they practically run themselves now and give me increasingdividends . As for myself "  --  he looked at Mavis , his chin determined  --  " I 'll publish the finest and most beautiful magazine the world has ever seen , nothing cheap but its price . And it 's not going to be highbrow either . It 's going to be the sort of beauty the ordinary man and woman can buy and understand and put in their pockets . It 's going to be the right size . The finest reproductions , lots of them in color , the best of fiction and articles , Americanand foreign . And verse , too  --  good verse . People should read poetry , they need it . I 've lots of ideas I have n't told you yet . Maybe we 'll run one-shots of the classics . Dickens and Turgenev and Balzac . If those fellows were once popular , properly presented , they 'd be popular again . The human heart does n't change much . . . . Is the salary I offered you as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let 's sit down . " " Oh , yes , " said Mavis , following him . She was going to laugh and say far better than I 'd expected , ' but thought better of it . One should n't let down one 's guard too much with Mr. Disola . " And now one more question , " said Mr. Disola , " I ca n't get a name . Any ideas on that subject ? Think it over . " He cocked his head at her . " Something sophisticated ? A little bit snobbish , but not alarming ? A suggestion of glamour ? That 's popular . " Mavis suppressed an inclination to smile . " Sophistication , Mr. Disola , " she said , " does n't mean what most people think it does . It 's a phony word , and glamour is too . Sophistication means a false argument , and glamour is an oldp281Scotch peasant word meaning a delusion wrought by witchcraft . " She felt didactic and blue-stocking , and became embarrassed . " You see , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked glamour and sophistication up . They 're bad words if you intend something honest and fine . " " Ah ! " said Mr. Disola delightedly . " I knew I was right . Some day I want you to meet Mr. Rotherstein . He 's a wonderful man . One of the most remarkable men that ever struck this city  --  a secondBenjamin Franklin . He 'll do great things . He 's just bought The Examiner , and he 'll make a newspaper out of it . That 's his real job , you know  --  the newspaper business . And this city needs a newspaper . As you know , he owns this company , too . " " I 'd like to meet him , " said Mavis . " A wonderful man , " repeated Mr. Disola , " and he 's come up from nothing . He 's with me to the limit on this new magazine . He 's a real idealist , I 'm not . We can afford to lose a million or more between us if necessary to educate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to his feet . " We 'll see . And now I wo n't keep you any longer . Monday at nine o'clock . I 'll tell Mr. Clarke , our treasurer . " He walked to the door with Mavis . His sensitive fingers clasped hers . Mavis went out into the long corridor that led to the elevators . To one side of her was a door lettered " Peek , Inc . Editorial Offices " ; to the other , was a door lettered " Strip , Inc . Editorial Offices . " She shrugged her shoulders . I do n't care , she said to herself . I wo n't have anything to do with them , and what he wants is lovely . Mavis was exceedingly happy . The world seemed to her , for the first time in her life , to be arranging itself with some degree of plan . For the first time , she could perceive to some extent her future . Here was a project into which she could put all her imaginationand energy , and as it grew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The salary Mr. Disola had offered as a beginningbewildered her , it seemed so large , and he had also mentionedan eventual interest . " It is Mr. Rotherstein 's and my policy , " he said , " always to encourage our leading people to buy stock , and we sell it to them if possible before it goes up . Give it to them , if we have to . That encourages morale and loyalty . " Mavis treated herself to a solitary dinner in state . She dined at the Bellevue . It seemed a gesture of defiance to Henry Armstead and his world . She took a chance of seeing him there , of course , but not much of a one , and what if she did ? She felt cold and powerful and well able to handle any situation . She glanced from under her long lashes at the people dining near her . In a year or so they would know who she was and raise their heads as she entered a room . She would be a distinguished person . She drank a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crabs , a specialty of the Bellevue , delicate as foam on the edge of a wave , and an ice and a small coffee . The warmth of the martinis was still with her ; she ordered a brandy . She smoked three cigarettes lingeringly , her eyes hooded and worldly . Several men had looked at her admiringly . The orchestra was playing , and very quietly , a series of waltzes . She wished she had some one to dance with , and suddenlyfelt that she had had enough , and paid her bill , and walked back to her studio . She would never leave that  --  her studio . It had become more and more home to her . No matter how rich she was , she would continue to live there until  --  years from now , and with reluctance perhaps , but knowing exactly what she was doing  --  she married . Meanwhile , she would look around for some man as a companion . You needed a man in many ways . For a love affair ? No , not if it could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companionship , it often was , but she thought that in her present mood she could manage things , and even if she found a love affair inevitable , or convenient , she now knew the value of self-protectiveness . I have become , she thought , a modern woman in every way . One learns through experience . She climbed the narrow stairs to the top story . The smell of her studio , rich with paint , was doubly reassuring . Paint had a comfortablesmell . She turned on one light , the lamp on a table near the wall , hesitated for a moment , and then went to the large closet where she had stored her paintings , including the ones she had made in Haiti , and taking them out one by one , set them against the baseboard of the room . She switched on all the lights and standing back , studied each canvas in turn before she put it back . Not bad , she thought . They were fresh and original . They had individuality and character . . . . Damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet , and leaving only one lightp283burning , stood in the middle of the room and , pulling her dress over her head , slipped out of the rest of her clothes . She stood there a moment white and slim , yet long-limbed and full , erect and thoughtful , then she started for her bedroom to find her nightgownand complete her toilet , but changed her mind and , turningout the remaining light , walked to the open window that looked down upon the neighboring garden with its bird bath . How lovely it was to stand there in the darkness letting the soft air pour over you ! Caress you . She raised her head and stared at the night . Experience was a hard thing , was n't it ? The only cure for pain was work . Whenever you paused to think , memory crept up behind you and took you by the throat . She wished she had not gone to the window . Her alarm clock back of her struck eleven , and suddenly her bell rang sharply and imperiously . She started away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the lights as she did so , and picked up a dressing gown , and came back to the studio . For a moment she hesitated in the center of the studio , her heart beating fast . She was glad she had a chain on her door ; she was always glad when some one rang the bell late at night . She crossed the room and opened the door an inch or so and peered through the crack . Her heart leapt and was still . " Oh ! " she said . Then she opened the door the length of the chain . Smiling at her was Henry Armstead . He looked tall and blond and shining  --  very tall and shining in the half-light of the landing . Mavis ' eyes were wide and frightened . " What do you want ? " she asked . His smile broadened . " To see you . I did n't know until today you were back . You never answered my letter . Let me in . " " What do you want ? " " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know until today you were back . " " Yes  --  you 've said that . " " Well  --  ca n't I come in ? I 've been thinking about you all evening . Longing to see you . " " But you resisted it until eleven o'clock  --  until you 'd had plenty to drink . "  | " I had an engagement I could n't break  --  I have n't had much to drink . " " Have n't you ? You 're drunk . " Mavis ' voice became cruel . " I do n't want to see you , " she said . " I never want to see you again . Go away , I hate you . " She started to close the door . He was not drunk really . She had never seen him drunk . Alcohol did not affect him that way ; it only made him hard and white and shining . Lucid and strange and hazardous , like a Lucifer desperately glad to hav  --  fallen even for a moment from the hampering heaven of Henry Armstead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its edge . " I do n't understand you , " he said . " I will close it on your fingers , " said Mavis quietly , but her heart was beating so that it was bigger than her body . " I want to talk to you . " His smile had become fixed . Suddenly it vanished and his face twisted with anger and pain . " What 's the matter with you ? " he demanded fiercely . " What 's wrong ? Do you think you can do what you 've done to me , and then wipe it off this way ? What 's wrong ? " Mavis became cold and sorrowful  --  sorrowful in an empty hopelessway . " What I have done to you  --  ! " she said wonderingly . One by one she bent his fingers back from the edge of the door . They were limp and unresistant as if he regretted what he had said . " You poor thing , " she said wearily , and closed the door.  |p285A  reform is a correction of abuses ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life  --  somewhere around twenty perhaps  --  Felix had discovered in himself a trait ; a habit , a trick of the imagination , a focusing of the attention , a clairvoyance , that often seemed to him a weakness and only sometimes a strength . At all events , it was distracting , and frequently disturbing , and occasionally appalling , always to be listening with an inner ear to what people were really saying and to be looking back of their eyes into their brains , and back of the walls of their chests and abdomens . And this habit interfered with your social life considerably and with the average summation of others , especially their summations of themselves . People were hardly ever what they thought they were or what they said they were . Self-deception 's favorite tool was supposed selfrevealment . Often it made you inattentive on the surface to perceive so clearly the skeleton sitting there bolt upright , and the strange little skull so eternally young if stripped of hair and flesh ; so vacant and so pathetically timeless . And this habit , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the victim of almost every beggar and rogue and wastrel , male or female , you came across ; twisted your sensible intentions into a little ball and threw them away . What could you do in the presence of this thing that for such a little while was trying to live and think ? Moreover , you realized that there , but for the grace of God , went whoever you were , and perhaps you went there anyway . How could you tell ? Like every one else you were self-deceived . At any rate , even when you were being deliberately cheated you were likely to say in your mind , " Poor stupid fool ! He thinks he is clever when he is so stupid that he does n't even know that I know he is cheating me . " As a result , a great deal of the time righteous anger was crippledby the tragic knowledge of human stupidity , and people assumedyou knew nothing when the trouble was you knew too much . ! E Queer , seeing these little men and women at the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selves far back in their narrow caverns . These cruxes . These images of actualpersons quite unknown to their owners who , mistakenly , thought all the while it was themselves who were real . And often these homunculi were frightening , and always they were lonely  --  small alarmed creatures the color of raw sweetbreads or peeled mushrooms , and about them was nothing debonair . They sat like toads peering out from under the eaves of caves , their unblinking gaze bright with fear . And strangely enough , you saw them often in the eyes of the arrogant and self-assured ; the blustering , and the cruel . What you did , and it was difficult to keep yourself from doing so , was to look right through a person if he , or she , interested you agreeably , or perhaps especially , if he or she interested you disagreeably , taking off the only partly concealing clothing and seeing first the white and shrinking and secret and terribly easily hurt body , with all its inevitable blemishes ; and then the intricate nerves and veins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And how the mind and the body had been born ; and how they would die ; and how at night the mind would lie awake and be alarmed . And how the body would send sudden dreadful messages to the mind it had lived with but never known ; the mind seeking desperately to consoleitself with the thought that there might be after all something greater than either mind or body . . . something imperishable , occasionally seen in sharp etched vision like the flash of summer lightning at dusk . And yet how in the end all would be one , at least , all that we knew ; and how all bones , being bones , would be alike , and all glory , and all estate . " Death ! " said the body . " No ! " said the mind . " Yes , " said the body . Very disconcerting all this , especially in the presence of the rich , the clever , the proud or the beautiful . And often people , women in particular , would ask why you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fact , you were paying far too much . Felix was exceedingly interested in the homunculus of the girl sitting on his right at the long and glittering table ; the dark thin/cheeked girl with smouldering eyes who was no less a person than Harriet Wilde , the daughter of his host and hostess . She would have been a pretty girl or , rather , more fascinating than pretty , with her thin cheeks , a good deal of color in them , her irregular obstinate nose , her smouldering eyes , her willful mouth , if she had been a trifle less contemptuous and less eager for disagreement . But she was fascinating enough as it was  --  too fascinating . At least , she was fascinating to Felix . He was displeased with the fascination . He had never met a homunculus that irritated him more and yet at times so attracted him physically . He felt a growing desire to bend this girl backward , mentally and physically , and he did not like that . Such desires were not consistent with his nature . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He remembered the embarrassingimpulse to spank the girl who had boarded the Abruzzi at Port-au-Prince . What was her name ?  --  oh yes , Mavis Spate . He was worried . Once more , could it be possible that a sudden accession of fortune had turned his head ? Released sadistic and tyrannical traits never before suspected ? But no , he did not think so ; it was merely that for the first time in his life he was feeling himself entitled to lift his eyes to women of a certain type , and however charming in many ways this type was , numerous members of it undoubtedly needed spanking or bending backward . It was necessary , however , to set his mind on higher forms of argument . He turned to the girl on his right . I must think of something , he thought , that will end for good this childish attack on me . I must think of some final , quiet , goodnaturedsentence that will destroy with one breath Stalin , wood carving , Communism , the Student Youth Movement , Frank Lloyd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour Felix had been talking to Mrs. Wilde at the head of the table on his left ; or rather , he had n't been talking to Mrs. Wilde , he had been listening to her . One did not talk to Mrs. Wilde . But there were compensations , especially if you wished to think of something else . You merely allowed Mrs. Wilde 's conversation to flow over you as a water-ousel allows the spray from a waterfall to drench him while , unconcerned , he goes about his business . Felix had been wondering why it was people were what they were , and reflecting upon how useless it was , for the most part , to try to do anything about it  --  he was thinking about the girl on his right . Even as he thought , his head turned away , his attention apparently directed to Mrs. Wilde , he could feel the girl 's warm , compelling , contentious presence . He realized that she took a great pleasure in provoking him ; in disturbing his tolerance , his usual open-mindedness . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why was she what she was , so deliberately self-mutilating ? He sighed inwardly . People were what they were . The people who changed , who improvedthemselves , who steadily grew , who corrected their faults , were people in whom inherently there was change , improvement , growth and self-criticism . The others talked endlessly and pitied themselves , and sought advice , but invariably fell back . The seekingof too much advice was a sign in itself . A wise man sought advice but only when it was necessary . People who were always seeking advice merely wanted to talk about themselves . No  --  unfortunately  --  people were what they were ; the interesting research , the only possible road to some dim eventual cure was to find out why they were what they were . Once they were , there was little hope for them  --  or else , all manner of hope . Economic determinism  --  allthe big , half-meaningless words and phrases with which people had been deluding themselves for the past forty years  --  back of all of these was human material . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , other virtues , constantly , without being aware of it , tripped himself or herself up with the following foot in the way old-time vaudevillians coming on the stage stumbled and fell . Only it was n't funny , it was sad . And this trick of stumbling was obvious to every one else , although unknown to the stumbler , just as the varied stumbling of those who watched was obvious in turn to all but themselves . The smouldering dark eyes met Felix 's . " Had a pleasant time ? Hear all about the Orchestra , and the opera , and the Home for Wayward Girls , and what a wonderful person Mother is ? I know you heard that . And what about labor ? Did you and Mother agree ? As you may have guessed , she 's against it . " Felix 's eyes widened thoughtfully ; he was no longer wearing his spectacles.  | " You speak of it much as she does , " he suggested mildly . " As if it were something separate with a capital letter , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call Management . ' I do n't think much is going to be accomplished along those lines . So far as I can make out , fundamentally the main difference between labor and what you call management is that one is a man and woman with six children , and the other a man and woman with two . " Her lips twisted themselves sardonically . " A simple solution . Are you given to them ? I thought you were a scientist ? " " So I am , " admitted Felix , " but anthropology , like physics and geology , is a science of the beginnings . We take a long point of view . Why do you ask ? You do n't think economics and sociology are sciences , do you ? " He was astonished , and not a little pleased , by his calm condescension . She deserved it . She flushed . " As a professor , you 've probably been talking to low-grade mentalities of nineteen or so , have n't you ? I 'm older than that . The academic ivory tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it ? " Felix grinned and was indulgent . She talked extremely well for a girl of her age ; almost too well . She chose her words carefully . She had thought a lot , if not always sensibly . " And you consider your own position grimy ? " he asked . Look here  --  he said this to himself , and with misgivings  --  we 're heading into a real fight . He decided to take his courage in both hands . " You 've been trying ever since I sat down next to you to quarrel with me , have n't you ? " he complained mildly , sitting forward and smiling . He was unshakably amicable . " I do n't want to quarrel with you . What 's the point ? Your father 's my trustee , and you and I should naturally be friends . " He looked the length of the long table and back . At its center was a magnificent bouquet of Mr. Wilde 's carnations . " Besides , this is my first party in Philadelphia . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The dark eyes remained sullen and contemptuous , but the willfulmouth trembled slightly . " So you think I 'm disagreeable , do you ? Yes  --  most people do . " The eyes flashed . " Why is it an attemptat intelligent conversation is always considered disagreeable ? "  | The long eyelashes drooped , hiding the eyes . Felix regarded the sullen face mournfully for a moment . " Would you like me to tell you ? " " Yes . " She looked at him . " It 's simple , " said Felix . " You 'll convince no one so long as you have a contempt for him or her . Discussion is between equals . " He leaned closer to her , absent-mindedly picking up a spoon and tapping the tablecloth with it . He looked down at the spoon . " You see  --  " he raised his head  --  " you assumed at once that I was professorial , provincial , narrow and reactionary , did n't you ? " " Well " Yes , you see you did . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that I am being forced upon you for the purposes of marriage . That would be natural . Well  --  perhaps I am all the things you think me , but I try not to be . As a matter of fact , I belong to no class spiritually or mentally . I do n't think I belong to any even actually . I try not to belong , anyhow . I 'm merely a solitary , isolated , hard-working human being , quite willing to listen to any one 's point of view if stated pleasantly . You make the mistake of trying to catalogue people . About the only classless people you 're ever going to meet are scientists and artists , anyway . " His eyes , studying her , were reflective . " Interesting , " he decided . " Both you and I have a high sense of inadequacy , have n't we ? Well , that 's all right  --  all intelligent people have . It depends on how you use it . It can make you or break you . " And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't in the habit of lecturing young women as intimately as this , especially in full evening clothes  --  a high collar , a white tie , everything . Full evening clothes made you feel warm and heady and conceited anyhow . She would think him indeed an opinionated fool ; a doctrinaire . But she would not let him alone . " I want to rip things apart , " she murmured . " Yes , " he agreed , nodding ; " that 's the real sense of inadequacy . " A dangerous girl , with her brains , her physical charm , and her point of view . Throughout history , the most dangerous and powerfulwomen as a whole had been blue-stockings  --  blue-stockings with demanding bodies . Women with brains had , in addition to the sense of inadequacy common to all intelligent people , the sense ofp291inadequacy common to women , and if they had demanding and beautiful bodies , consciously or otherwise they took their revenge out on the opposite offending sex . And woe betide the intelligent man , for he , especially , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inadequacy ? " Her question was gentle and almost childlike . Felix smiled . " I know you have . " " Thank you . " She had trapped him . " How banal ! The explanation for everything . I thought better of you than that . " She studied him appraisingly . Suddenly she leaned forward too . " You are not entirely uninteresting , but you are complacent and repressed  --  Oh yes , do n't interrupt me . You 've been describing me to myself for a long time , now it 's your turn . " She was smiling faintly , her eyes half-closed . " You have brains , and you 're well-intentioned , but you 're inexperienced . You have everything worked out in your mind and systemized , have n't you ? But some day it 's going to blow up in your face . For a man of your age  --  how old are you ? Thirty-five ?  --  you are n't rebellious enough . Rebellion means vigor . Criminals are n't the dead scum on the pond of the slums , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're criminals because they have more brains than the others . Human nature is a force , and it 's a law of nature that you have to do something with a force , good or bad . You ca n't just leave it alone , or bottle it up . If you leave it alone , it 'll rip things apart , as I want to rip them . If you bottle it up , it 'll explode . " For the first time the dark eyes had been entirely self-forgetful . " You damn fool , " the girl said startlingly , " you try living in Philadelphia , brought up the way I was . " Felix leaned forward , applauding . " And now , " he said , " you 're talking like a woman . Yes , of course I 'm repressed , and I 'm afraid I 'm complacent , too . I 'm a man talking to a woman . I try not to be . Sorry , I wo n't be again . " She shook her head . " Oh no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking like a woman , I 'm talking like a person . " " Sorry again , " said Felix . His eyes were puzzled . " But I thought you were bottled up , not left alone . " He glanced at Mrs. Wilde , busily instructing the gray-haired man on the other side of her . " I should say you were bottled up . "  |p292The  girl shook her head . " Oh no , you do n't understand . My parents are modern parents  --  at least my father is . I 'm not bottled up except because I 'm I. I bottle myself up . I 'm allowed to do what I want . I have a studio in town . I see whom I want . I 'm not bottled up enough . " Her voice was bitter . " Never in all my life have I had to fight for anything , so never has anything seemed worth fighting for . The religion of my parents is a pretense , their charity is a makeshift , their deepest emotions have to do with place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion is . Until I found this real quarrel , I had nothing to stick my teeth into . Even being made love to  --  what 's that ? I can have it any time I want , but I do n't want it ; not seriously . " She shrugged her shoulders . " Maybe what I 've found to believe in is nonsense . It does n't seem to have worked out very well , but at least it 's something to believe in . It 's the only religion I 've got . " She paused as if ashamed of herself . " You make people talk too much , " she said . Felix , watching her intently , felt unhappy as a little while before he had felt hot and uncomfortable . Far back in the smouldering eyes he had seen a small , naked figure ; cowering and fearful but timidly arrogant . " I 'm afraid , " he said gently and appreciatively , " you 're hunting the very thing you 're running away from , are n't you ? You 're preaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be  --  would leave a vacuum like the one you 've found in your home . Meanwhile , you neglect everything in the foreground . Perfect conditions do n't seem to suit the human race  --  at least , not yet . I 'm all for amelioration and improvement ; in fact , I think I 'm what might be called . a radical-liberal , but I 'm for evolution , not revolution . " Abruptly she was her contemptuous self . " Liberalism , " she said , as if she had heard it somewhere else , " is merely a desire not to be bothered . . . . I see Mother is gatheringthe eyes of the so-called ladies . We 'll leave you alone for awhile . " She pushed back her chair and arose , Felix following her . Her eyes met his . He smelled the perfume she was wearing , faint and exciting , and lowering his eyes , accidentally saw the whiteness of her breasts , the shadow between . Thrusting and pointed breasts , he thought . He wished she was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not so near 1205 Cassianut Street . Hep293wished she did n't attract him so much in a certain way . He wished he liked her better . " I 'd love to see you really angry sometime , " she said provocatively . " You 're slightly irritating . Did you know that ? Why do you smile so much ? " " Shyness , " explained Felix hesitatingly . " A muscular reaction . You 've seen it in dogs . " He was sure that she had noticed his embarrassedglance while his eyes were lowered and that made him the more embarrassed . He shook his head . " Oh no , you would n't like to see me angry . I only get angry about once every two years , and then it 's horrible  --  at least for me . I 'm ill for a couple of days and break out in red spots  --  principally on my stomach . " She laughed and turned away , following her mother and the other women as they left the room . " You 're a quaint creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her shoulder . " I 'll see you later . " Felix sat down and helped himself to a cigarette . " I think , " said Mr. Wilde to the eight gentlemen present , " we 'll go into the other room . " Felix walked with him down the hall and into a library . " Enjoying yourself ? " said Mr. Wilde . " Oh , very much , " said Felix . " I 'm not , " said Mr. Wilde . Presently brandy and liqueurs and coffee were brought , and Felix took a benedictine and a coffee , and was glad he was sitting in a corner . Every one was perfectly polite to him , but no one was especially interested ; none of the men were as interested as the women had been . The conversation was brief and to the point but well sustained . Some of it was about golf , some of it was about business ; two men talked horses ; two others shooting ; a few talked personalities . Every one knew every one well . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarettes and sipped their coffee and cordials . Only once was there any excitement , and that was when some one mentioned politics . Then every one was unanimous and profane ; completely and blandly profane and without constructive thoughts . It was obvious that anything that existed was taken for granted . Change was the mortal enemy.  | Felix was interested in these men . He imagined that they were fairly typical of the ruling classes of the city ; Mrs. Wilde had repeatedtheir names to him , and those of the women , during dinner and given him a history of each . They were important people ; their families had been important for generations , and they were a clearly marked tribe , individually more strongly differentiated than most Americans , but overlaid , each of them , by a common patina that if you saw enough of it you would come to recognize at once as belonging to a certain class in a certain locality . It would be difficult , Felix reflected , for a Philadelphian to hide his light under a bushel . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease , of intermarriage , of distinct convictions and traditionsand prejudices . It was as lustrous and as opaque as the patina of old glass . Felix thought of the women , too ; now some distance away in the sitting room . They were a good-looking lot , practically all of them ; the older men and women distinguished looking , the younger men and women inclined to be blond with a shimmering quality of good health and clear eyes . Young and old they had fine bones , and it was obvious that they exercised a great deal and lived a great deal out-of-doors . For the most part , they had beautiful easy manners . They wore their self-assurance as informally as they wore their excellent clothes . They would seldom be openly unpleasant even if they disliked you . They were , as a matter of fact , like improved Englishmen and very much improved Englishwomen . They had the English trick of not bothering you ; the American virtue of being aware of your presence . On the whole , they had the best manners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever met , although some of the older women had a local trick of cold-blooded exaggerated endearment . They were likely to beginsentences with a rising inflection and a " But my dee-air ! " Felix was beginning to isolate Philadelphia cordiality which means even less than it does in other parts of America . You felt at ease with these people , however , unless you forgot yourself and became too political or philosophic or fervent . Yet they were sufficiently cultivatedand civilized . They discussed music , painting , books , museums , all the other surface expressions of the day , and they knew a lot . The only manifestations that seemed to alarm and upset themp295were enthusiasms , originality , abstract ideas and too logical argument . Every now and then an abstract idea escaped and fluttered about like a wounded bird until it was put out of its misery . Those who were aware watched its flight with uneasy eyes . Felix had noticed nuances when he had been introduced . There had been implicit acceptance of him because he was a Philadelphian , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , but beyond that there was an equal implicitness that he would have to make his own way according to local usages . He was there , and that was all right , because he would n't have been there , except through some glaring carelessness , unless it had been all right . But this was merely a beginning . If he continued to behave himself like a Philadelphian it would continue to be all right . In the eyes of no one except a couple of the younger married women had Felix noticed a look of more detailed appraisal , of a desire , perhaps , to forget everything except pleasant personalities . Certainly no one exhibited the interest , often mischievous , of New Yorkers in a stranger , and there was a soothing lack of the eagernessof most Americans to make an initial good impression . No one was in the least interested in making a good initial impression . Why should any one want to make a good initial impression ? You were what you were , and if you did n't make a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only on the faces of a couple of the older guests had Felix caught an expression that led him to believe that they recollected his history . One pink-cheeked charming white-haired little gentleman , with quick blue eyes , had seemed completely cosmopolitan , and Felix had loved him . He had shaken Felix 's hand warmly . " Ah yes , " he said . " Ah yes . You 're Adele Bartain 's boy , are n't you ? I knew your mother well . A lovely person . A lovely person . " Felix adored him . Was n't it comforting and exciting to be spoken of as " Adele Bartain 's boy " ! But the little old gentleman left immediately after dinner . He was seventy-eight , some one said , and always left immediately after dinner . Felix missed him . Fine people , Felix thought , if not , the majority of them , stimulating  --  atleast , the majority of those at Mrs. Wilde 's dinner party were n't . Fine people , reassuring , until you came to grave and ter- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stood . Loyal , unless you flouted their prejudices . Their principal fault seemed to be that they did n't want any one or anything to grow up , including themselves . They wished life to remain static . The trouble is , thought Felix , they are owned by the things they own , instead of owning them . They are n't free . They are charming and well-bred slaves . Fortunately in this case the things they owned were nice and their traditions were better than most . He remembered what Mr. Wilde had said his Uncle Felix was fond of repeating . Not one of these people , save possibly Mr. Wilde , and of course , his daughter , was aware for a single moment that the entire dinner party was hanging with its heads out into space and was thousands of miles away from where it had been when it had sat down at Mr. Wilde 's table . And had you mentioned this simple physical and astronomical fact , every one  --  except Mr. Wilde and his daughter  --  wouldhave thought you a dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phrase . Felix wished that in every city there might be some sort of political , social , financial and moral planetarium , just as in a few cities there were sidereal planetariums , where an expert with a pointer , a light in its end , would demonstrate in the darkness the constant motion of life and humanity and the laws of cause and effect . Felix was glad to get back to the women . He approved of these formal respites after dinner and wished that more hostesses would adhere to them , they were even more restful and necessary spirituallythan physically , yet almost always he was glad to get back to the women . Women , however dull , were trained to exhibit interest , although sometimes , about things of which they were ignorant , their interest was disturbing . Men , the sort of men he had met tonight , were n't going to be interested in any one unless that person was interested in the things in which they were interested . Men imposed upon others their own interests very much as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took it for granted that you must be interested in the things they were interested in ; if you were n't , " you were a queer fellow . " But for a quarter of an hour after entering the sitting room , Felix felt that perhaps his admiration for the receptiveness of women was exaggerated.  |p297More  through inertia and shyness than anything else , he found himself on a window seat next to a Mrs. Ingraham-Wilson . He had been introduced to her before dinner . Mrs. Ingraham-Wilson was a large woman in her sixties who had just returned against her will from twenty years in Europe . She had the suspicious attitude of people with hyphenated names and found everything American naive , even Philadelphia . American earnestness she thought especially naive . Felix found her difficult to talk to ; she had spent most of her time in Biarritz and so was unaccustomed to sentences which contained articles or verbs , or which were consecutivein series of more than three . She nodded her graven and enamelled face , and greeted Felix with the kindly condescension of one greeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , " that you are an archeologist . I knew one intimately at Pau . How interesting . " " What was his name ? " asked Felix . Mrs. Ingraham-Wilson was at a loss . " I 've met so many people . . . . Have you been in Mexico ? " " Yes , " said Felix . " They say the ruins are fascinating . " Felix to his surprise found himself launched upon a bitter description of the Europeans . He had not known until then box bitterlyhe felt and afterwards he realized that he did not feel as bitterly as he thought he did , but at the moment his one desire was to destroy Mrs. Ingraham-Wilson and all other silly Americans who , not realizing what they had at home , allowed themselves to be fooled by the childish self-esteem of second-rate aliens . " There is nothing , " he tried to explain to Mrs. Ingraham-Wilson , " so far of the slightest importance in the world except an attitude . The human race is as yet far too young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a student I was much impressed by the wisdom of my elders . At the University of Michigan , for instance , at Oxford , at Munich , I was appalled by savants , but now that I am fairly mature myself , I know that the wisdom of the wisest man in view of what can  --  and will  --  be learned , is merely the crying of a two-year-old child . " He leaned forward earnestly and looked up into Mrs. Ingraham-Wilson 's impassive face . " Do I make myself clear ? " I do n't know why I am talking to her this way , he thought , she does n't understand a word I am saying.  | What a wonderful face , he thought , to be carved on a mountain in South Dakota or somewhere . " So that is why , " he continued , " Europeans now annoy me so much . The English , being islanders and so a little removed , are the best of the lot except the Scandinavians who , even more removed , both by blood and situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as for the rest of them , with a few exceptionslike the Dutch , they 're cases of arrested development . During the Renaissance they started to amount to something because they knew themselves to be young and were therefore humble and alert , but since then they 've steadily degenerated and now are crystallized in the most infantile conceit . Politically , artistically , morally  --  anyway you want to look at them  --  they 're bad and disagreeable children , and thank God they do n't impressme in the least any more . What are they anyway ? What are the grounds for their complacency ? They are only a couple of thousand years old , and during most of those they ate like wolves and scratched for lice . Sit down with one of them ; find out just exactly what is back of their posture of superior knowledge . You will discover as a rule nothing but prejudice and misinformation . " He wished to stab Mrs. Ingraham-Wilson to the heart . " There is nothing , " he added fiercely , loathing the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the behavior of a number of American women  --  thank goodness it 's going out of fashion  --  with a certain type of European man . Why do they like to be lied to ? Why do they find charming a technique as creaking and old as the covered wagon ? " He thought that simile brilliant . " The great hope of this country , " he resumed , " is that at long last we are realizing all this , and are beginning to assess Europe properly ; the great hope is that we 're trying to develop a civilizationtypically our own . And that 's what I mean by attitude . . . . We are too young  --  the whole human race  --  for anything but an humble and wondering and receptive attitude , and the very thing that up to the present has permitted the European to put it all over the American , properly understood and handled , may be the very thing that will make us great . After all , the most conceited Americanimaginable is humble and eager to learn compared to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to havep299run dry . " Over here , " he concluded , " we have exactly the attitude of the European at the beginning of the Renaissance . They were fine people then . " Once more he asked uncertainly , " Do I make myself clear ? " Mrs. Ingraham-Wilson had drawn back from him as far as the window seat permitted . She was studying him with uplifted head , looking down her nose as if he were something that had crept out of the wainscoting . She yawned with what Felix thought was a combination of indigestion , bewilderment and dislike . " Would you mind getting me a glass of water ? " she asked vaguely . " I have to take my medicine every three hours . " Felix went over to a table where there was water , and whiskey and soda , and filled a glass and started to return with it . Harriet came up to him . " I 'm to take you home , " she said , " if it 's all right with you . I have my car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How are you getting on with the monolith ? She has had three husbands and I should think was just ripe for another . They get younger each time , and she 's very rich . " She grinned at Felix wickedly . " Poor soul ! . . . You 've done your duty . I 'll take care of her . Go and talk to Mother , and then , if you can , find some one attractive . " She looked around the room and sighed . " God ! " she said . " How lousy ! How incredibly boring it 's been . " Felix had noticed the change in her the moment she had come up to him . The willful mouth was smiling , and softly ; the smoulderingeyes were bright and amused . She has decided to accept me , he thought ; because of something about me , quite unknown to myself , she has decided to overlook , unless she can cure them , my soft liberalism and provincialism . He turned back to the table and helped himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cigarette reflectively and stood where he was for a moment , a frown between his eyes . She 's a strange girl , he thought . She 's not a ragamuffin  --  I 'm sure of that . She has few of the traits ; among other things , she 's too serious-minded . She has no particular morals , of course ; those would be against her principles , but she 's not a ragamuffin . She 's out to prove something to herself , although I do n't know what it is . Most evil came from bafflement , did n't it ? And most bafflement started early , and right in the home , as it had with this girl . The devil in the beginning was usually a refusal or a denial ; a forbidding . If you could only take the terrific force that was a person and direct it properly instead of trying to dam it ! He remembered his uncle 's letter . " Channel yourself ! " Once during dinner , in the midst of an argument , this girl 's silken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lingered for a moment against his , casually but warmly , seeming to deny the antagonism in her eyes . He had not known what to do ; he never did under those rare circumstances . It was accidental , of course  --  he always tried to think that ; the gesture seemed to him a vulgar one  --  but what should you do ? Should you maintain the position as if unaware of the proximity , or should you withdraw your own knee delicately ? In any case you were on the horns of a dilemma . If that was what a woman wanted , you wounded her if you showed signs of alarm ; if that was not what she wanted , and the juxtaposition was innocent , by calling attention to it , you both insulted her and made her think you had an unpleasant mind . Felix turned away from the table and walked thoughtfully towardMrs . Wilde where she sat on a couch at the other end of the room . He felt guilty and vaguely traitorous toward Mr. and Mrs. Wilde . Mr. Wilde was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his intimate relationship to the former , it was almost incestuous that , on the first night in his house , he should have had errant thoughts about his daughter , mild as they were ; he , who for years had had so few errant thoughts about any one . He remembered , with dismay , the queer blurred moment , shortly before Harriet had left the dining room , when she had paused in what she was saying , and looking at him slowly and deliberately  --  and insolently  --  hadsaid , " I think some day I 'll have to try to convert you . " She could n't convert him intellectually . That would be impossible . But despite his self-imposed inexperience he was well aware that between men and women there were other forms of conversion . And this form of conversion  --  this unwilling slavery  --  was terrible and often ruinous . Felix remembered with an empty sense of humiliation the widow.  |p301THE  SMALL and rakish runabout , battleship gray with a canvas top , poured itself like quicksilver along the lanes of Chestnut Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winding road to the Wissahickon Drive , and into Fairmount Park . Its lights picked up the trunks of great trees on either side , and carefullyclipped hedges , and occasionally a big house set back among lawns and trees ; and then there were smaller houses back of tiny lawns , and a cluster of apartment houses , and then once again , as the park was reached , the trunks of great trees and the smell of new grass and leaves coming out . Harriet drove beautifully as if her foot on the gas , rhythmic and accustomed , quieted an unsatisfiedand unrhythmic mind . She had at least one great virtue , she was often silent . A horse , a man , a motor car , thought Felix  --  to women of her type the mere control of such things is an end in k itself ; the destination is nothing . Dogs were too humble ; there was not enough resistance to break . A person had to be gentle really to like dogs . Felix sat back in his corner of the car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited but not happy . It is always exciting to have an attractive girl take a sudden interest in you , even if the interest is alarming . Felix felt that this girl knew too much along certain lines , was too intuitive ; assumed too much without anythinghaving been done or spoken . Was too well aware of her influenceover a certain type of man . Her silence was in itself a sign . It was an intimate silence as if powerful words had been said and accepted and there was nothing more now to be said save in casual conversation . But that was n't true . Little had been said except in acrimonious argument , and nothing would be said . Felix was uneasy with the impression that this girl was looking right into him , and although he had himself the habit of clair/voyance , it was not comfortable when the clairvoyance was reversed . No man likes that , even the most virtuous . The runabout curved from the leafy darkness of Fairmount Park into the long glowing line of the boulevard that led to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city , skyscrapers held the horizon like a range of tumultuous but flat-topped mountains , and the tower of City Hall , with its illuminated clock , was like a single sharp peak with the moon above it . Some one once had had a fine idea , but the city had wearied . The boulevard with its trees and grass and fountains led beautifully toward nothing . The boulevardwas like the fictitious scenery with which Potemkin lined the roads and rivers of Russia when Catherine the Great made her tour of imperial inspection . The girl at the wheel spoke for the first time in a long while . " How about a drink ? " she suggested . " Will you stop in at my studio ? It 's just around the corner from your house . " Every one in Philadelphia lived just around the corner from every one else , it seemed ; that is , if they lived in Philadelphia at all , and that is , if they were the sort of people who lived just around the corner . " Oh , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beat . " It 's half past twelve and I must get up early tomorrow . I 've started work again . " The car turned into the narrow and deserted byways and thoroughfaresof the older city . " Do you know a girl who lives in St. John 's Street named Mavis Spate ? " asked Harriet abruptly . " She 's a painter of sorts . She lives right around the corner from you too . " She laughed . " Lots of girls live right around the corner from you . " " Why yes , " said Felix , surprised . " I do n't know her . I 've met her , but I do n't know her . " He was silent . " That 's odd . I did n't know she lived here . Why do you ask ? " " Because I think she came up in the same boat with you . You must get to know her . " Harriet 's voice was slightly malicious and Felix turned and looked at her half-averted face as she stared above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , " Harriet went on . " She 's very pretty and I imagine conventional . A clean-cut American girl ; hard-working and ambitious . " " Are you trying to insult me ? " asked Felix.  |p303She  laughed . " Why do people always deny what they are ? " " I 'm not conventional , " said Felix . " No , but you like conventional women . " Felix sighed . " I do n't know anything about women . I 'm just beginning to meet them . " He hesitated . He was being trained in repartee . " I like people who are not always trying to shock me , however , " he concluded . " And you think I do that ? " " Do n't you ? " " I 'll introduce you to Mavis Spate the first chance I get . " Harriet'svoice was still harsh . " She 's got quite a lot of talent . She 's been making dress designs , and things like that , and painting on the side , but now she 's become editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm afraid she 's sold herself down the river . " " Sold herself down the river ? " " Yes  --  she 's stopped painting . " " Perhaps she has to make a living , " suggested Felix . For a moment Harriet was silent , her face grim in the shadows . " You despise me , do n't you ? " Felix looked at her again and shook his head . " No  --  I do n't despise you . " He wished the conversation would n't always take this intimate form . " How do you feel , then ? " " Are you interested ? " " Yes  --  naturally . " " Why do you want to fight with me ? And why do n't you go to New York and refuse your allowance ? " She was silent for a long time . " Yes  --  you do despise me , " she concluded . " Well , here 's your house . . . . No , do n't bother to take me to my place . I 'm only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She leaned toward him . " I hope you 'll come to see me whenever you feel like it , and I 'll stop fighting with you  --  I really will . " Her eyes were brilliant in the light of the street lamps . " Anyway , I hope you 'll come to an eveningparty I 'm giving in a couple of weeks . Will you ? You 'll meetp304some really interesting people  --  not like the people you 've met tonight . The party 's for Sharpe Wyatt , the English painter . He 's a great friend of mine . He 's done some frescoes and is going home . " " Thank you , " said Felix . " I 'll try to . Thanks . " She put her hand out impulsively and at the same time released her clutch a trifle . " Do n't despise me , " she said , and drew her hand away sharply lest Felix be dragged against the wheels . An odd girl , thought Felix , dangerous even if she does n't mean to be . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's doing . But she 's not the stuff of which martyrsare made . She 's no real revolutionist.  | " God dig-you-den all ! Pray you , which is the head lady ? " " Thou shalt know her , fellow , by the rest that have no heads . " LOVE 'S LABOUR 'S LOSTALMOST in the exact center of Philadelphia , spiritually if not geographically , is the huge emporium of John Wanamaker . All Philadelphians know this , but then not all people are Philadelphians , incredible as this , to Philadelphians , may seem . Until recently , in the arcaded Chestnut Street entrance to John Wanamaker 's , there stood , not much noticed , a more than life-size statue of Marie Joseph Paul Roch Yves Gilbert Motier , Marquis de Lafayette . Just why this heroic statue of the French liberal and aristocrat should have been placed where it was , even temporarily , is not clear . The shoppers going in and out of the battery of doors had no time to look at the aloof Gallic features , for if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow democrats , and the marquis faced a street so narrow that nothing on it can be viewed in perspective . The marquis seemed an accidental epitome of the worst features of democracy ; the intellectual , sensitive face rising above the heads of those too interested in their own small transactions to pay any attention to the general scheme . Mavis had left the offices of the new magazine around half-past four and had started to walk the six blocks that separated her from her home . As she approached the corner of Broad and Chestnutstreets it began to rain ; at first a mild late April mist , exciting because of the coolness that touched your cheeks , but pretty soon there was faint thunder over in New Jersey beyond the Delaware , and the afternoon darkened . A real storm , she thought , and quickenedher pace . She was caught in the dilemma of the thrifty pedestrianwhen it begins to thunder  --  she was too near her destination to take a taxicab with a clear conscience , still too far away not to run the risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all at once the rain came down in earnest . Mavis almost broke into a run looking for shelter , and presently there was the arcaded entrance of Wanamaker 's and the statue of Lafayette . Mavis darted into the shadowy alcove . The arcade was already crowded by those seeking protection like herself and by shoppers trying to get past . The shoppers trying to get past jostled those seeking protection with the indifference of people in a crowd . Stomachs , rumps and elbows bumped and slid off each other indifferently , the owners of which , had a stranger laid a hand upon their shoulders in the most friendly of fashions , would have called the police . There was a smell of damp clothing and tired humanity . Mavis was pushed nearer and nearer the pedestalof the marquis until one hip was against a corner . She attempted to free herself and dug an elbow into male ribs . " I beg your pardon , " she said and looked to her right . Standing beside her was a slim young man , a felt hat pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a storm than Mavis , for he had no overcoat of any kind and was clad in a very elegant , obviously brand-new suit of dark blue flannel , a white stripe in it . Mavis stared . " Oh ! " she said , and then  --  " Why , you are n't wearing your glasses any more , are you ? " The young man turned to her , blushed , and looked out at the street where in the darkness of the storm the drenched and hurryingcrowds resembled the debris of a freshet . " Odd ! " he murmured , and glanced quickly and shyly back at Mavis . " Is n't it ? . . . You mean , meeting this way ? " " Yes . I was talking about you just the other day . " " You were ? With whom ? " " A girl . " " What are you doing here , anyway ? " " Shopping . " " No , I mean in Philadelphia . " He raised his eyebrows . " Why , I live here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Why did n't you tell me on the Abruzzi ! " He opened his mouth and stared and his eyes were satiric . " I did n't get much chance , did I ? " He looked out at the streetp307again . " Quite a lot of people live here , " he observed . " If it constitutedan introduction it would keep one busy . " He seemed to be talking to himself . " Apparently you were the only person on the Abruzzi who did n't know all about me . That 's nice . " He turned to Mavis again , swiftly but stammeringly . " I would like you to understand , " he announced , " that I am not picking you up . You spoke to me first . I did not even know you were standing beside me . I do not pick people up . " Mavis 's expression was one of complete bewilderment . " You do not pick people up ? " " No . I am referring to the time I tried to speak to you on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brows in puzzlement and then burst into laughter . " Oh ! " she said . " Oh  --  I 'm so sorry . I remember now . I did n't mean it that way . I was horrid  --  yes , I know . Forgive me . It was n't personal . I just was n't in a mood to talk to people . " He seemed mollified . " I suspected that . " He glanced at the street . " I think it 's going to clear up . In which direction are you headed ? " " Home . " " May I walk with you ? I 'm going that way too . " " You seem to know a lot about me . " " I do . I 've been in Philadelphia only a couple of weeks , but I 've discovered that either you know all about a person or else that person does n't exist . " He raised his head reflectively and looked up at the remote features of Marie Joseph Paul Roch Yves Gilbert Motier . " This is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of the largest . It 's the only place left in the world except the crypt of the Spanish kings in the Escorial where class is still recognized . " " Then you wo n't like me , " said Mavis . " I do n't belong . " He smiled faintly . " Neither do I , really . We 're both vagabonds . Come on . Let 's start . " He led her down Chestnut Street . " This is out of my way , " suggested Mavis . " I should turn down Thirteenth Street . " " It 's an unlucky number . Twelfth is better . I need exercise . " Mavis glanced at him sideways , a puzzled smile in her eyes.  | He was rather delightful-looking and completely unaware of the fact . He was very shy , she knew , and easily disconcerted , but he had at moments the brazenness of the shy person , and he was quietly obstinate . Her eyes narrowed and she stared down ChestnutStreet . This was an unexpected meeting , and unexpected meetingsalways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was what she was vaguely searching for ; perhaps this was destiny . He would be very easy to control , she knew . Chestnut Street was fresh and clean washed after the rain . For a little while it had ceased to resemble a tall expensive painted woman , restless from indulgence and at heart a drab . The shadows were ample with the reflection of the late afternoon sun , and Twelfth Street , as Mavis and Felix turned into it , shone so that you did not notice the dejected office buildings and little shops . PresentlyMavis and Felix were walking beside a long brick wall of old bricks , irregular and with warm purple and geranium tints in them . " Would you like some tea ? " Felix asked . Mavis hesitated and then nodded . " Yes . There 're a lot of little tea shops around here , or you could come to my studio . It 's just around the corner . " She looked at Felix and grinned . " Are n't you afraid ? " " Of what ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I 've had to get over it . It 's in the will --  " What will ? " " The will . " He guided her around the corner of the brick wall into CassianutStreet and started to ascend marble steps guarded by wroughtironrailings ; at the top of the marble steps was a white colonial doorway with a fanlight . He took a latchkey out of his pocket . Mavis halted at the bottom of the steps , her mouth open . " Where are you going ? " He looked down at her smiling . " To get some tea . Or , you can have a drink if you want it . " She blushed , her mouth sullen . " I do n't always drink highballs . " He chuckled . " I understood that too  --  you were unhappy . " Her eyes , studying him , were speculative.  | " You 're really very clever , " she said . " Thanks .... Coming ? " She hesitated . " Yes , " she said suddenly . " I like insanity . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his side . " I see you have a latchkey . Do you live here ? Has it become a boarding house ? Incidentally , it is one of the loveliest old houses in town . I 've looked at it for years . An old gentleman named Bartain used to live here , but he died . I was just going to call your attention to it . " " It is a nice house , " said Felix complacently and inserted his key . The smell of the drying rain , of wet asphalt , turned to the aromaticsmell of old woodwork and floor wax and rugs and wellusedfurniture . The long hall was shadowy . The noise of the traffic was like a minor waterfall . Mavis stopped and gasped and looked about . " Oh ! " she sighed . " It 's lovely !  --  Far lovelier than I had thought . I 'm so glad to see it at last . Thank you . How lucky you are to live here . They must be nice people  --  the people who own it now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a little ? Do you suppose they would mind ? " Felix shook his head , his eyes twinkling . " No , of course not . " She went into the front drawing room and presently came back into the hall through the door of the second drawing room that looked out on the garden . " There 's a garden , too , " she said , " with a huge magnolia in it . It 's incredible . Why is n't it a museum of what Philadelphia used to be ? What the Germans call a cultur-geschichte museum . Or is that the right word ? Anyway , no private person has a right to live in such a house . Not nowadays . Who plays the old square piano near the garden windows ? " " I suppose I will , " said Felix . " I play by ear . But it is n't tuned yet . Shall we go out to the porch ? It 's back this way  --  off the dining room . " She took a deep happy breath . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get an apartment ? Is it expensive ? I love my studio , but still --  " They could , " said Felix , " if I liked them . But in your case She frowned , searching his face . " How do you mean , if you liked them ? . . . Who owns this house ? "  | " I do , " said Felix simply . " The old gentleman named Bartain was my uncle . He left it to me . " For a moment she seemed poised for flight , and then she sighed and faced him again . " It 's unbelievable , " she murmured . " It 's like the Arabian Nights . " Her smoky blue eyes looked into Felix 's , grave but smilingfaintly . " It 's too much . Far too much . " " How do you mean too much ? " " I mean too much . Everything . Lead on , Haroun Al Raschid . Up to a certain limit  --  and who knows  --  perhaps beyond , I 'm your willing slave girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned toward the dining room  --  and frowned . But it was a pleasant and fairly frank face ; as frank as any young woman 's face can be . She was not subterranean like Harriet Wilde . He would not have asked HarrietWilde into his house unaccompanied . He led the way toward the dining room and the porch . " I eat breakfast and lunch out here , " he said . " It 's nice , is n't it ? Later on , I think I 'll have dinner out here too . People do n't eat enough out of doors , although Americans are getting better in that respect . They do n't squat enough , either . Did you know squattingwas very healthy ? It 's healthy mentally and spiritually as well . That 's one reason why the East Indians are so meditative . All simplethoughtful people squat when they meet . Chairs are a mistake . I 've heard our cowboys squat too . " " Well , I 'll take a chair if you do n't mind , " said Mavis . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sighed contentedly , and stretched out her long legs , and , takingoff her hat , released her dark curls . She looked at Felix grinning delightedly . " I think , " she said , " you 're crazy . " Felix sighed . " I wish I were . In the present state of the world , it 's the only satisfactory accomplishment so long as it is n't manic-depressive . What would you like to drink ? " " I would love a Tom Collins . " " So would I. " Felix rang for James Peace . James Peace showed no surprise , but Felix , knowing him well ,  |p311was  aware of an aura of solicitous pleasure . James Peace had the social and romantic instincts of his race , and Felix long ago had surmised that James Peace 's one reservation where he was concernedwas that he did not entertain enough , especially in this fashion . James Peace 's simple and warm Seventh Day Adventist soul had not yet reached the point where the ordinary fruits of the earth seemed to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet entirely out of the Garden of Eden . He would be disappointed , Felix thought , if he knew how innocentall this was . The Tom Collins came and the dusk too  --  an April dusk , almost a May dusk now , with the scent of the grass in the garden and the other growing things mingling with the sterile smell of the streets and the traffic beyond the wall . Felix did not turn the lights on . He and Mavis had another Tom Collins . Felix felt worldly and released , comfortable and master of himself . There was , after all , much worth and fineness in living in a cosmopolitan place where to drink two Tom Collinses was not considered drunkenness as it would have been considered at Maclean . He and Mavis talked contentedly and casually , and with  --  for Felix , at least  --  surprising candor . Felix had n't talked this way for years except to Carl Thurman . It was exciting and relieving , and good for you . This girl had a genius for making people talk about themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much interested in others as she was in herself . And she was deeply interested in both . Little by little she told Felix about her ambitions , her desire to paint , her early life , her work in Haiti , the magazine ; she even hinted at the background of her father . " That 's interesting , " said Felix . " Excellent psycho-analysis . Not so very long ago another girl was telling me about her father . There ought to be a school for fathers . They certainly raise thunderwith their daughters , just as mothers do with their sons . I 'm never worried about the younger generation . I 've taught them . Each younger generation has to live , and so that keeps it going . " He thought about Harriet Wilde . " Even the follies , " he added , " and apparent indifference of each new generation  --  if the latter is its pose  --  is a way of finding one 's path in a world that 's strange and new . It 's just a mere grown-up way of stalking Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever changing to you , you 're fundamentally all right . That 's motion and increase and discovery . It 's only when it seems dull that there 's danger . I 'm never afraid of the younger generations ; I 'm afraid of the older . It 's the fathers and mothers who ought to go to school . Practically all the nonsense of younger generations , and the failures , are due to parents . " He grinned , his nose wrinkling . " Over eighty per cent of all homes should be written , Babies enter here at their peril . Beware the mother and father complex . ' " He laughed outright and amended himself . " But once again , the harvestdepends on the soil the seed is sown on , does n't it ? I daresay complexes have helped people as much as they 've hurt them . At all events , every one has them . In your case , for instance , it seems to be working well . Tell me some more about Haiti , and this ThaddeusSerpa , and your present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all his life talked so easily to a woman . He even forgot to stammer occasionally ; he did not blush once . Shortly after the first Tom Collins he had reached into his pocket and taken out his pipe and had filled it and lit it , and actually smoked it . He was smoking it now contentedly . In his turn he had told Mavis something of his past ; his boyhoodin Philadelphia and Detroit , his days at Michigan and Munichand Oxford ; his work at Maclean . He described in detail the Van Sittart expedition and how Mr. Wilde 's cable had reached him in the Canal Zone , and the struggle he had had to make up his mind . " I suppose I 'm a fool , " he concluded . " I 'm so unfitted for this sort of thing . " " Oh no , you 're not , " she contradicted him vigorously . " Oh no , you 're not . It 's wonderful . You 're the very sort of person to whom such things should happen . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's pretty bewildering , " said Felix , but he felt encouraged . " By the way , going back to that Thaddeus Serpa business  --  by this time you 've realized , of course , why he said what he said to you . About your painting , I mean . " " No  --  why did he say it ? I 'm afraid it 's true . " " Not necessarily . There 're two ways of breaking down a woman 's resistance , I imagine . One way , you encourage her untilp313she will give you anything ; the other way , you discourage her until she 's so hopeless she will do the same . " Mavis stared at him in the dusk . " You 're an astonishing person , " she said . " It seems to me you know a great deal about women for some one who apparently has seen so little of them . " " I 've studied them objectively , " said Felix . " It 's a great advan-tage . " " And you intend always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He was uncertain . " Although I do n't know . I suppose if I stay here  --  and I do n't know whether I 'm going to or not yet  --  I ' 11 have to marry sooner or later . It will be more or less my duty . " He looked at her puzzled and inquiring . Mavis laughed . " That 's a fascinating prospect for some girl , " she observed . She glanced down at her wrist watch and jumped to her feet . " Good gracious . It 's almost seven , and I have an engagement with Disola at eight  --  dinner . We 're going to discuss the magazine , especially its name . We ca n't get one . " She smiled indulgently . " Mr. Disola , like so many exaggeratedly busy people , has to do most of his real thinking when he 's supposed to be resting . All his conferences are at luncheon or dinner . I feel ashamed of myself . I 'm getting a huge salary , and in addition half my meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , adjusted it , pulling it down over an eyebrow , and stood where she was , smiling , turning her head so that she took in all of the porch , shadowy in the lemon-yellow twilight . " Could I  --  ? " she asked uncertainly . " Would you mind , if I walked about the house for a few minutes ? Just a few minutes . It 's such a lovely house , especially at this hour . I 'll be right back . You need n't go with me unless you want to . " " I wo n't , " said Felix . " People ought to see things by themselves . Other people interfere with first impressions . " She smiled appreciatively . " Thanks . " Felix sat down again and in the growing darkness waited for her . It was nice thinking of her going from room to room above him , some of them lit , some dimly lit , some unlit . Tall , vigorous , shining-eyed , she would be looking and appreciating ; life in its fullness going from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead people . From now on the house would be younger . In ten minutes she was back , standing in the doorway to the porch , the light from the dining room outlining her . " It 's a strong old house , " she said softly  --  the very words Felix had used to himself . " Enormously strong . The people who built it knew just what they thought , did n't they ? And they expected no change ; an additionhere , an addition there , but no real change . " Her voice quiveredslightly as if she were ashamed of her sentimentality . " But I think it 's afraid of being pulled down  --  You can feel it . Well , good night . And thank you much more than I can say . It 's been a real experience in more ways than one . " Felix walked to the front door with her and out on to the steps . Cassianut Street was assuming its nocturnal loneliness . The disorderlylittle shops that had been let into the fronts of the fine old houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were softeningin the darkness into some semblance of congruity . The girl , saying good-bye to him a second time , was smiling at Felix appraisingly . She said a cryptic thing as she released his hand . " Good-bye , " she said , " you are protected by a strange thing . You have your own especial armor ; it 's complete un-selfconsciousnesswhen you 're interested in some one else . You may get into lots of trouble , but I do n't think many people will want to hurt you seriously . You compliment them too much . You make yourself too strong and also too defenseless . It is only when you 're too objective that you 'll be in serious danger . " A strange thing to say , and mature , but then she was somewherearound twenty-six , and girls of twenty-six are mature  --  that is , if they 're ever going to be . Felix wondered what she meant . He hated mysterious sayings . Some day he would ask her . He watched her as she walked up Cassianut Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . A nice girl ! A wonderfulgirl ! She might even be intelligently interested in monkeys if the subject were put up to her properly . Felix was warmed by the gratitude toward fate one feels when , unexpectedly , one meets a person who seems completely congenial . This is one of the loveliest and purest of feelings . Of course , there was no such thing as complete congeniality , but this girl at first glance seemed pretty close to it . And she had promised to comep315back , and in exactly the same way , casually and intimately ; and he had promised to have tea with her the next day in her studio ; and she lived just around the corner . Suddenly the city seemed far less strange . It was as if he had made for himself a little warm cave in it . Felix went back into the house companioned by a calm elation.  | " Fish House Punch has been the main speciality of the State in Schuylkill ' since this association was founded in 1732 .

CHARLES BROWNE " THEN I will warn you , " said Mr. ' Wilde , " that its taste is delightful , but that its results can be deadly . Upon first sipping it resembles a delicate lemonade with what might be called a soul  --  a kick in it , as it is sometimes known . With the second glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third and fourth , and so on , the results vary according to the individual . Some sing , some dance , some are filled with beautiful imaginings , the more elderly are inclined to sleep , while the less worthy fight or attempt to make love . I doubt very much if such a deceptive and charminglyhypocritical drink could have been invented anywhere else but in Philadelphia . Only the sporting Quaker would have thought of spiking lemonade with dynamite . " Mr. Wilde turned to the bartender , attentive behind the bar , and grimaced . " Do you ever have any call for Negus Club Punch here , John ? I mean , do any of the gentlemen drink it in a casual sort of way ? " The bartender grinned . " It is an especial drink , sir . I would try to dissuade any gentlemanunless he had the whole evening before him . " Mr. Wilde looked sideways at Felix and nodded.  | " That is what I 'm telling you , " he cautioned . " I wish to warn you as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomea member and will be put to the test . " He sipped his sherry . " For a hundred and sixty-three years or thereabout , " he resumed , " the recipe of the Negus Club Punch was a secret , a memberwho let it out would have been asked to resign , but somewhere in the Nineties it was generously decided that this point of view was selfish . They say that it was first introduced to the public at a debutante tea and that all that late afternoon and night the more fashionable streets of this city rang with the cries of intoxicated old ladies . " Felix and Mr. Wilde were keeping their appointment to have lunch together at the Pastorius Club , and Mr. Wilde , with some hesitation , had suggested that they have a drink before they went up to the dining room . " I hardly ever touch anything , " he said , " during the day , but this is rather an occasion , is n't it , and then tomorrow is Saturday . " A look of content had crossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he added . Felix was immensely impressed by the Pastorius Club ; he thought it one of the most charming and soothing places he had ever seen . As soon as you entered the beautiful spacious door , a huge fanlight above it , and climbed the three wide marble steps and passed the hall-porter in his wine-colored livery , and came to the long corridor , hung with portraits and painted a delicate colonial buff , upon which all the rooms on the first floor opened , you felt the atmosphere . You realized that here was one of the few spots left in the world where there was a self-imposed code and where every one had to be fairly well-mannered even if he did n't feel like it . But that was only part of it . About the Pastorius Club was the leisurely comfort of a place devoted exclusively to masculine habits and minor masculine vices , and the calm of a building no woman had ever entered except a few anonymous chambermaids . The Pastorius Club was chaste as the faint blue smoke of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was merely a fact that single-mindedness , masculine or feminine , is chaste , that is , it is stark , non-rococo , and a further fact that no man can be entirely single-minded in the presence of women.  | Mr. Wilde had told Felix something about the history of the Pastorius Club ; it was the outcome of a Gentleman 's Reading and Chess Room established around the time of Franklin , and the PastoriusClub had moved only twice in its history . Its present building , a magnificent old brick edifice occupying a quarter of a block at Eleventh and Locust streets , and entirely undecorated except for extra-size windows with many small panes and the beautiful classic door with the fanlight , had been occupied in the 183o 's . From a litter of Greek restaurants and nondescript resorts where ladies with handkerchiefs around their heads told fortunes with tea leaves , the impressive facade of the Pastorius Club arose like a monument from the time when gentlemen actually read and played chess . And every day , except Sunday , at noon , and in much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , the corner of Eleventh and Locust streets was frequented by leisurely self-contained gentlemen , old and young , happily oblivious to Greeks or fortune-telling . " Nothing , " said Mr. Wilde , glancing at the beautiful dark furniture and portraits of the main corridor , " is ever modernized if it can be avoided . On one occasion we had to get some new chairs for the library  --  one of the best , I may add , in the city  --  and for six months no member sat in them . The Pastorius Club believes not in change but furniture polish . " Now , as he leaned against the bar , finishing his sherry , he said , " Felix , " grimacing in his strange fashion , " you ought to feel ghosts here  --  every male member of your family has been a memberfrom the beginning except your father , and he , of course , was not a Philadelphian . " " Do you remember my father ? " asked Felix . The spaniel eyes were reminiscent . " Very slightly , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a couple of times . A handsome young man  --  exceedingly . He looked like a cavalier . . . . Well  --  shall we go of good food . " He sighed . " I can remember the days when Philadelphiahad the best food and best restaurants of any place in the country . The little old Bellevue , for instance ; that , my dear boy  --  that was one of the great restaurants of the world . Philadelphians used to go abroad , to Paris , to other centers , and hurry home top319eat . But now , outside of private houses , where the food is still very good , and a club or so like this , and maybe three restaurants , there is hardly a place in . Philadelphia where you can get a decent meal . Bastard Italian-French cooking has swept the town as it has the entire world . Everything tastes like a sunken souffle  --  even the apple pie . " Felix and Mr. Wilde had walked halfway along the corridor and were ascending broad , softly carpeted stairs to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Wilde , grimacing , " that my entire mind out of office hours is devoted to cooking and other material pleasures , but it is not . As a matter of fact , my interestin food and wine is more philosophic and national than personal . I am an extremely light eater , but I hold with a number of famous men much wiser than I , that good food properly cooked , washed down by proper wine , is perhaps the most civilizing influencethere is . One feels this especially as one reaches the age where one realizes that women are quite unfitted for the job . . . for civilizing the world , I mean . " There was an unexpected hardness in the spaniel eyes . " Women are savages . Anyway , beware the hasty eater and the Prohibitionist ; they too are barbarians and cruel . I hold with Brillat-Savarin that the discovery of a new dish does more for the happiness of man than the discovery of a star . ' " They had come to the wide entrance to the dining room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently been reserved for him . A waiter hurried forward and led the way to a small table for two in a far corner . " I have taken , " said Mr. Wilde , sitting down and unfolding his napkin and waving Felix to his place , " the liberty of ordering in advance without consulting you . I trust you will like my choice : a clear soup , a trace of sherry in it , shad roe and bacon  --  this is the time of year when those excellent fish disport themselves amorouslyfor the benefit of man ; cucumbers on the side , of course ; and potatoes au gratin . Also , breaking my rule again , a quart of Moselle , the lightest and most fragrant kind . We can order our dessert later . I regret it is too late to order oysters . The club has a special breeding ground off the coast of Virginia  --  an island  --  and its oysters are such as are unknown elsewhere . Long gray deliciousfellows , as salty as a sea wind . None of the horrid white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped himself to a crisp , delicately browned roll from the basket in the center of the table and applied butter to it ; butter as inviting as a May field . " Philadelphia , " he said , " missed a great opportunity with its food , just as it has missed every other opportunity presented to it . It had a chance to express in all ways , spiritually as well as materially , the flower of America . " He shrugged his shoulders . " I am afraid it must be the climate and latitude as well as the blood and tradition . I have heard on fairly good authority , although I have never yet looked it up  --  I have always meant to  --  that Philadelphia has the exact latitude and physical conditions of Boetia in Greece , a city more noted in classical times , as you remember , for the burliness of its inhabitants than their intellectual content . Add to this a damp and usually soft climate such as one finds in England , and a universal passion for outdoor sport at the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you 've got , which also embodies a magnificent capacity for such things as Negus Punch . " Mr. Wilde glanced down the length of the diningroom and then back at Felix . " A good-looking lot , " he observed . " Physically , I am always rather proud of them , especially after I have been in other cities . They are not as smartly dressed as New Yorkers , they tend , as you will notice , to the clothes of the country gentleman , but they have a look of race , an ease of manner , a magnificent quiet self-assurance . The only other Americans that average up to them are Bostonians , and Bostonians are sailors with a quite fictitious tradition of culture , so even with the best there are traces of bad manners and restlessness . " Mr. Wilde leaned forward , his arms on the table . " You know , of course , that this is the center of fox-hunting in America , despite Virginia , despite the Geneseo Valley , despite all other claims . With some of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men from horses and vice versa . And we are also a tremendous rowing city and the heart of American cricket . There 's still a lot of the last , and not so long ago the Gentlemen of Philadelphia could compete on even terms with any eleven in the world . You will see some of these lovely green cricket clubs around here , although most of them now have been given over to tennis and golf . You should go out , however , " he added sardonically , " before the Japanese beetles get to them . "  |p321Mr  . Wilde bent toward his soup . " It is so strange , " he remarked , " that no one has ever applied his mind to the proper drinking of soup . A cup is better than a plate , of course , but some sort of noiseless funnel would be best of all . I may be oversensitive , but to watch a lovely woman gurgling and sucking has always seemed to me unnecessarily disillusioning . " He finished his soup . " And the beauty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is hereditary , and natural , and taken as one breathes . Many of the better-placed Quakers and Church of Englandmen brought their hounds over with them when they arrived in the seventeenth or eighteenth centuries . Did you ever hear of Peter Grubb ? He was a great ironmaster up near Lancaster . You know they lived there in the most magnificent way  --  great estates . He tied his hounds neck to neck and threw them in a burning lime kiln one day when they missed the scent . " Mr. Wilde grimaced . " A passionate fellow , I should say . I understand the hounds still bay and whimper on moonlit nights . " Felix , too , had glanced around the room , and he continued to glance at intervals while Mr. Wilde was talking . It was a long room , the walls painted a delicate colonial buff like the corridor downstairs . At its far end was a magnificent sideboardglittering with silver  --  vases , memorial cups of various kinds , punch bowls  --  and halfway down the length of the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some hidden beam . There was the same classic simplicity that marked the rest of the club . The only decorations , save for the sideboard and its trophies , was an occasional excellent portrait of some formerpresident , a splendid elk head and , facing it , an elephant head , and the frieze of plaster acanthus leaves that ran just below the ceiling . It was one of the handsomest rooms Felix had ever seen , and the sixty or so men , young and mature and old , seated at the various tables , large or small , fitted Mr. Wilde 's description accurately . Here and there an obvious eccentric clung to an extra high collar or was elaborately careless in his appearance as if to express contempt for a world which had not sufficiently consulted him . Opposed to these , was an occasional eccentric of another kind ; a man so exquisitely attired , cornflowers in his buttonhole , that you knew he did little work of any kind and was forced to compensate for his shyness by intense concentration upon his appearance.  | The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Wilde had tested them and had been a trifle displeased . " A bit too well done , " he said , peering down judicially . " Just a bit . Maybe a minute more than was necessary . An assistant cook , I imagine . Shad roe is one of the most delicate of dishes . If underdone it is disgusting ; if overcooked it tastes a little like straw . " Suddenly he was chuckling as he tasted his potatoes , one of his rare exhibitionsof the kind . " Your Uncle Wirth , " he said , " is a famous characteraround here . He never appears any more by daylight , but each evening paddles down here and dines my himself . He is both a gourmet and a gourmand and has become , as perhaps you have heard , a fantastic miser . For some years apparently he has taken to holding up his trousers by means of a string , a dangerous experimentconsidering his figure . " The lizards darted in and out of Mr. Wilde 's eyes . " Two springs ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was sitting in the periodical room looking over the evening papers when another member entered with a guest . Your uncle looked up  --  not cordially , he is not cordial , but he looked up , and the memberwho knew him said Mr. Bartain , this is my friend Mr. Soand-So . ' " Mr. Wilde finished his last forkful of shad roe . " Despite his lack of cordiality , " he resumed , " your uncle is none the less a gentleman of the old school . He arose , bowed , shook hands , there was a rending sound and his trousers fell about his feet . With entire sangfroid he continued to complain about the weather . " Mr. Wilde 's spaniel eyes were reflective . " It must have been a horrible sight , " he concluded . He was abruptly apologetic . " My dear fellow , " he said deprecatingly , " I 've been deluging you with my own ideas and a lot of musty comment . You 've hardly had a chance to speak . Forgive me . I trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plate to one side and clasped his hand on the table ; leaning forward a little , half smiling , half grimacing . " Philadelphia has an especial flavor and it is one of my particular hobbies . I see it as a person who is still an outlander , but for the most part I have to bottle up my observations . The one thing Philadelphians do not like to discuss is their city ; the subject bores them . The more intelligent ones agree with you , so it is old news to them ; the majority regard it as an impertinence . Here it is , take it or leave it , and who asked you to use your mind ,  |p323anyhow  ? But it is a fascinating place , Felix ; interlarded ; interwoven . Slow as honey , thick as wool . Study it . " Felix smiled . " Mr. Wilde , " he interjected , " this is my city by inheritance and now it seems to be again my city by the turn of fortune . Everythingyou can tell me is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting . A city is just like a person , is n't it , and every city everywhere is a different sort of person . " He was thinking of New York , so feminine despite its hardness and assumption of masculinity , and he was thinking of Chicago , another city he knew , so uncertain and incoherent and emasculated  --  notfeminine but emasculated  --  despite its bluster . And of Detroit , which was just nothing . Merely a desert of houses and machines . He was also thinking again of this room which had a consecrated appearance . For a hundred years it had been set aside for one purpose only , as a temple for the gastric juices . The walls , the waiters , the members exhibited reverence and concentration . There would be lifted eyebrows , mentally at least , if any one gorged , ate hastily , belched , or paid no attention to his food . There was a pleasant mild smell of hard-crusted rolls and bread , of butter , of steaming dishes and cigarette smoke . Whatever else might be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as London . Felix had to admit to himself , however , that he knew very littleabout clubs . At Michigan he had barely made an inconspicuous fraternity , entirely vague as to what fraternities were all about  --  a state of mind which persisted  --  and at Maclean his clubs had been the " Faculty " and the local Service Club known as " The Pards , " an international organization , but not one of the best . Its very name suggested on the whole low-grade mentalities because it was a bad pun on a combination of the words leopard and partners . The Pards were supposed to be as quick and far visioned as a leopardand as loyal to each other as the Theban Phalanx , barring certain habits of that organization of which , so far as it was concerned , The Pards were unaware . Felix had joined both the " Faculty " and " The Pards " less from good will than from nervousness and coercion . The " Faculty " had two moth-eaten rooms over a drugstore and subscribed for a number of magazines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more recent issues could never be found . Felix suspected the members of the English Department of stealingthem . " The Pards " met twice a month in a restaurant run by an Italian . Afterwards Felix went back to his room and before he did anything else , drank a glass of bicarbonate of soda . Althoughhe was fairly indifferent to food , Felix was constantly amazed that in a section of the country with such a high tradition of cooking as the South , good cooking had almost ceased to exist . Mr. Wilde , his pince-nez on his nose , was studying the menu . He handed it to Felix . It was properly written in blue ink , not vulgarly printed . " How about a sweet ? " suggested Mr. Wilde . " And a small coffee ? " " I would love , " said Felix , " a chocolate eclair . " Chocolate eclairs were among his few gastronomic passions . He was aware the moment he spoke that he had said something wrong . Mr. Wilde raised his eyes and cleared his throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , sir , " he said in a low voice , " advise an eclair at this season of the year . " " It is not , " interrupted Mr. Wilde , " that they mate , as does the oyster , in the months without R , but that warm weather does not agree with them ! " " I see , " said Felix in a muffled voice . " Strawberry ice cream , please . " For some absurd reason he felt extremely embarrassed . " You have chosen well , " said Mr. Wilde . " In all the world there is no equal of Philadelphia strawberry ice cream . In fact , I might say that outside of Philadelphia no one really knows what ice cream is , and even in Philadelphia one must be careful which confectionerhe patronizes . " He took off his pince-nez , blew on them , wiped them , and put them back in their case . " Sauter 's , " he said , "  --  Sauter 's . They make , one might say , about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , I would always send over here for my ices , or cakes , or buns , and always to Sauter 's . It is Philadelphia 's oldest and most distinguished pastry shop and Sauter 's ices , ice creams , cinnamon buns , eclairs , lady-locks , and so on , are unlike any others I have ever tasted . Incidentally , they also run a small restaurant on Locust Street above Broad that is a paradise for the gourmet . Very simple , very plain , one does not talk much , one goes to eat . " He leaned back in his chair , stirring the small coffee the waiterp325had brought him . Despite his eulogy of Philadelphia ice cream he had refused a sweet . " To refer again , " he resumed , " to Philadelphia food in general , and this city 's peculiar characteristic of being accidentally supreme and then relinquishing this accidental supremacy without a struggle , and without even being aware of it , it may interest you to know that ice cream was first invented in Philadelphia around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's look of surprise . " Yes , " he nodded , " the addition of cream , not milk , to sherbert was first imagined by the Haitian cooks who came up here with their refugee masters during the slave revolutions in the West Indies that marked the early eighteen hundreds . There are a number of Philadelphia families that are the descendants of these planters . Ices of course  --  sherbets  --  have been known since antiquity , also frozen custards , but not ice cream . " He sighed . " And think , too , of all the other dishes peculiarly Philadelphian , now spread in deteriorated form throughout the country . Philadelphia terrapin , Philadelphia butter , Philadelphia capons ; white mountaincake , meringue glacees , brown crisp ones , not those small etiolated ones you get elsewhere , with a dab of whipped cream on top , called absurdly a panocha . Macaroons you can chew upon instead of having them break into tasteless crumbs , and so on , and so on . And then the Pennsylvania Dutch ' dishes and specialties  --  pretzels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; junket ; various kinds of cakes and pies ; scrapple , sausage . " Mr. Wilde sighed . " Yes , " he said , shaking his head affirmatively , " if I lived anywhere else in this country I would send to Philadelphia for my ice cream , my water ices , my cinnamon buns , my meringue glacees , my pretzels  --  although the last come from Reading , even my salt , pepper , other spices and condiments , and cigars . Philadelphia boasts the most ancient and famous firm of wine merchants in the country , Wagner Brothers , known to connoisseurs everywhere . They also carry , naturally , cigars , and make a specialty of spices , condiments and honey ; honey straight from the slopes of Mount Olympus and other classic meadows . Some time I must take you down to their place on Dock Street , it is one of the sights of the city for those intelligent and cultivated enough to know what it means , and the members of the firm are without exception charming ; gentlemen as well selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs a subterranean stream to keep damp and at an even temperature the cigars stored there not only for sale but also those already bought by their customers and stored until needed . " Mr. Wilde grimaced . " About that vault , " he concluded , " is the impressiveness of both a cathedral and a bank . " He pushed back his coffee cup and arose . " And now , " he suggested , " I think it about time we met the Admissions Committee , do n't you ? They are waiting for us in the reading room . Let me warn you again not to call fox hounds dogs or to speak of the President . " He hastily amended himself . " That is to say , favorably . " Henry Armstead had sent Mavis a letter of apology accompanied by a box of roses the day after his appearance at her studio door . " I am ashamed of myself , " he wrote . " I can only say that a man in love is not responsible . Can you possibly forgive me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never knew that loving a person was like this ; I did not believe it . Will you let me come and talk to you ? I am not quite sure what is the matter , but whatever it is , if I have been in the wrong , the decision or cure is with you . If you no longer love me , then let me be your friend . I shall not bother you in any way ; I will be exactly what you want . Friends  --  intimate friends  --  are valuable . You do not meet many . " All day Mavis had carried this letter  --  the exact words of it  --  around in her mind . The words haunted her whatever she was doing . Late that afternoon she had telephoned Henry to come to tea . It is absurd , she thought , to cut off a friendship with a man you like . I will be able to handle this situation . I shall tell him exactly how I feel.  |p327Be  temperate in eating , girls , and sloth , Or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RICHARDTHE BUCCANEER 'S REST , the small restaurant which Harriet hadhired for her farewell party to Sharpe Wyatt , occupied an entire house on St. John 's Street . It was a charming house of the last of the Colonial period , square , two-storied , low-ceilinged , but it had not been designed for cigarette smoke or the noise of modern merriment . Any respectable buccaneer , used to the comparatively subdued orgies of the eighteenth century , would have been shocked . When Felix arrived around ten o'clock , the Buccaneer 's Rest , upstairs and down , swam in blue haze , and only those indifferent to bad air could breathe easily . The night was mild , and the small windows of the house were open and the small wide front door . A block away , coming through the narrow quiet of St. John 's Street , Felix had heard the hubbub . St. John 's Street was filled with the damp nostalgic smell Felix had come to recognize as the night smell of older Philadelphia ; a lonely but close smell , saturated with the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell compounded of river mist and soft coal , of old pavements and brick houses , of swamps drained from their original purpose , and of innumerable back yards where the soil was still unsealed . Added to this was now the warm smell of late spring . The atmosphere of the Buccaneer 's Rest was a considerable contrast . For a moment Felix stood in the small square doorway searchingfor Harriet and wondering why it was the more gregarious primates so frequently mistook clamor for gayety . To his regret , his own countrymen seemed peculiarly given to this confusion . A queer people , Felix thought  --  Americans . No wonder they puzzledother nationalities . A queer people , often witty , usually brilliantin one way or another , but hardly ever happy and unselfconsciousand mildly humorous . Not a really gay people . Capable of enormous exultation but hardly ever of sustained content . It was always as if they were bowed down by packs on their shoulders which held secret treasures . At all events , they seemed only at their best when the going was hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal . Americans were doomed to hard work , and to hard exercise , and to exploration , physical and spiritual . And of course they would be , for they were the descendants , every one of them , of pioneers . Even the meanest immigrant was a pioneer or else he would have stayed where he was . We are never content just to be , Felix thought , leaning against the door jamb of the Buccaneer 's Rest . We tear the moment to pieces looking for the end . And if we should ever find the end , we would throw it away looking for the next moment that then would not come . It would be better if Americans succumbed to their fate ; tried to find out more what that fate actually was . They would discover then that although theirs was no happy fate , it might indeed be a glorious one . Meanwhile , they were the worst " party people " imaginable . About the only nationality which really desiredgood , about the only nationality that had little trace of the European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detesting more than most lechery and drunkenness , Americans went to parties and pursued by their Hound of Heaven and bowed down by their fate , drank much more than was good for them and tried to forget their Hound of Heaven by hunting assiduously for equally drunk and foredoomed women . The trouble with Americans , thought Felix suddenly , is that the whole darned lot of them are poets . And we 'll never be civilized " socially " because we 're far too sensitive and civilized otherwise . What is known as " society " is barbaric . But we are a wonderful people . A great and shining and wonderful and hard-bitten folk  --  that is , if we would only be ourselves . We are indeed " the people , " because we are " the idea . " We are the selected ones ; the future . The main room of the Buccaneer 's Rest , into which opened immediatelythe door where Felix was leaning against the jamb , was crowded with shuffling couples . Cigarette smoke hung above their heads like the folds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke made it even dimmer . Near windows looking upon an alley , a six-piece Negro orchestra squealed and brayed and chuckledwith remote dark laughter . The present inhabitants of Mr.p329Penn 's " greene countrie towne " swayed and wriggled and circled orgiastically . Apparently the soaring skyscrapers , and the miles of streets , and the ponderous trust companies , and the elaborate suburbs had as their final aim no more than the permitting of these dancing couples opportunities in which to dance orgiastically . It seemed a complicated way of arriving at the simple fact of mating . Nor had it much to do with the gay innocence of actual dancing . Felix , not finding Harriet amongst the dancing couples , made his way slowly toward an inner room where , from a distance , he had seen the glitter of a brilliantly lit bar , people crowded against it . He paused in the entrance to the bar looking about , and as he did so , Harriet detached herself from a group of friends and came toward him , arms outstretched . " Dar-ling ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  You 're late . " Felix found himself being kissed . He drew back , alarmed , but recognized that it was a contemporary custom and so grinned . Harriet led him toward her friends . For the moment she was a different Harriet , almost too sparkling and self-forgetful ; her eyes enormous , her cheeks flushed . " My anthropologist , " she announced , waving a hand . " My father is his guardian . So am I. He is fascinating , but a little back-ward . " Felix continued to grin but , as he was aware , sheepishly . " I will be back in a minute , " said Harriet , and left Felix crowded against a tall homely girl with auburn hair and a beautifulwide grin . " Are you really an anthropologist ? " she asked . Felix smiled and nodded . " I 'm a bio-chemist . We 're both a little out of our element , are n't we ? What 's your specialty ? " " Monkeys . " " An anthropologist ? " Felix felt the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started with man but branched off to monkeys . " " Oh , I see . Ascending in the scale . Have you seen our guest of honor ? " The auburn-haired girl indicated with her head the room of the dancing couples . Through the haze of the cigarette smoke , Felix saw a tall young man chinning himself on a beam that sup/ported the ceiling . Several of the dancing couples had stopped and were watching him admiringly . " He usually does that about this time of night , " said the auburnhairedgirl . " He 's very proud of it . He has enormous biceps despitehis hollow chest , and by means of his accomplishment , seems to have won the hearts of several of my more athletic friends . Personally , I would prefer to be wooed by subtler methods . " She turned back to her whiskey and soda . " Why is it , " she complained , " that when Americans want to do anything they get a foreigner ? When they want to find out  --  or rather , not find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Sun Valley , they get an Austrian , and when they want to paint murals of William Penn treating with the Indians in the underwear department of their Men 's Shop , they get an Englishman . Englishmen never wore underdrawersuntil a few years ago , anyway . At least , so I 've heard . Let me order something for you . You 've just come . You have to be here an hour or so before your voice is heard . " I might as well , thought Felix , and decided he would have a whiskey and soda too , and then he felt an arm through his . It was Harriet . She swung him toward her . " Come on , " she said . " You and I dance . " She led Felix into the next room . Reluctantly and fearfully Felix joined the shuffling couples . He remembered the agony of the Abruzzi and wished , so long as he had to dance , that it might be with Dea . Suddenly he found himselfthinking of Dea with considerable homesickness . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she were here ; it would at least be reassuring . Dea knew how to handle herself in situations like this . He was surprised by these reflections ; it was the first time he had thought of Dea as being comforting . When you came to think about it , she had a lovely , acquiescent , companionable way about her . " I dance terribly , " he murmured in Harriet 's ears . She smiled and said nothing . Methodically and absent-mindedly Felix shuffled . He became aware of Harriet 's pointed breasts against his soft evening shirt . His heart stirred uneasily . She was not wearing a girdle and beneath his hand he felt the soft strong muscles of her back ; there was practically nothing between him and her . His hand slid lower ,  |p331encircling  her waist , and as if in answer she made a little movementand pressed closer to him . Her thighs were touching his now . Felix raised his head and saw the bright doorway leading to the bar and beyond it , people talking and gesticulating in groups . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this dance . Harriet laughed softly . " You do n't dance badly , " she said in a small voice . In it was the same lingering husky note Felix had noticedwhen , weeks before , she had said good night to him after her mother 's dinner . She shook the sleeve of his coat with her left hand . " Why have n't you come to see me , silly ? " she asked . " You 're rude . I 'm just around the corner , and people come to see me almost every afternoon . " " I 've been terribly busy , " Felix said , " getting settled and trying to work . " " You should n't work all the time , it 'll make you stupid . " " I 'm stupid anyway , " said Felix , merely to gain time . She laughed again , looking up at him , her breath on his cheek . " Oh no , you 're not . That 's an excuse . You 're merely frightenedand lazy . " " Frightened and lazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not frightened , " asserted Felix stoutly . She shook her head , smiling . " Oh yes , you are  --  of me , for one thing . " " Of you ? " Felix 's voice was sceptical ; and then to his horror , and as if his voice was far off and he had nothing to do with it , he heard himself saying  --  heard himself whispering  --  " What do you mean ? " What an idiotic thing to say ! How insulting ! He had n't intended to say anything of the kind . What he had intended to say , and lightly , was that he was a simple and direct person , not good at games , not good at make-believe , easily affected , and so a person who might misunderstand others who were good at games , at make-believe . The back of his neck was cold with embarrassment and fright . But Harriet was not angry , merely amused . She drew back her head and looked up smiling appraisingly.  | " What a man ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what I mean ? " Her face was sullen . " How should I know ? If you were interested , you might find out . " Suddenly she said : " Come on  --  let 's get a drink . " She tucked her arm through Felix 's and led him toward the bar . She was friendly again . " Felix , " she said teasingly , " you do n't realize what a temptation you are , do you ? Everything about you . You 're a temptation , darling , to any woman . You 're funny beyond words . I think as your guardian by right of inheritance , I 'll have to protect you . You 'd be terrible if you ever let yourself go . Call on me if you need help , will you ? " They came to the bar and Harriet put a foot on the rail and looked at Felix sideways , her eyes narrowed . " I want a rye and soda , " she said . " Irresistible . You do n't know , do you  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have led . You have n't the slightest idea . You must be practically irresistibleto certain women  --  to the self-distrusting but dominating woman . " Good Lord ! thought Felix , but aloud he said to the bartender , " I 'll have a rye and soda , too , please . " Women were different , were n't they , after they 'd had a drink or two ? Some one ought to warn them about it . Mr. Wyatt , alight with the incandescent , impervious gayety of the Englishman under the influence of alcohol , pushed his way between Harriet and Felix and leaned an elbow on the bar . " Sorry ! " he said . " Sorry ! " And then , secure in the national delusionthat " sorry " atones for everything , turned his back on Felix and addressed Harriet exclusively . " I did it ten times tonight , " he said with modest pride . " What ? " " Chinned myself . I must be wonderfully fit . Light of my life Number Four , there are three things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Well , never mind . You know what I mean . Anyhow , my lovely red dragoness , my beautiful hammerand-sicklepuss . . . God , why do n't you leave politics to your betters ! . . . listen , I must kiss you passionately , I must give you my London address  --  if I can remember it , and I must have anotherdrink . The last shall come first . " He studied the drink that had been handed him and then raised his head as if a bright ideap333had struck him . " And I shall kiss you thrice , my winsome puss , " he said . " Once for Joe Stalin , the old darling , and six times for yourself . " Felix , his hands in his pockets , looked around for the auburnhairedgirl and , not finding her , strolled in the direction of the front door and better air . To the south , St. John 's Street lay deserted except for some large cars parked end to end in the direction of Spruce Street , filling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were dark and somnolent and one could imagine chauffeurs dozing . These were the cars , Felix decided , of " the patrons " and " patronesses . " It had not taken him long to divide the party into three groups ; and he imagined that this was a typical Philadelphia " artistic " party of the better sort . First , were the inhabitants , mostly young , of St. John 's Street , and streets like it . Interlarded with these was a scattering of mature , composed , and well-cushioned men and women in eveningdress , Felix 's " patrons " and " patronesses , " come to see how the artistic world was getting along . They were people , Felix decided , interested in painting and music , and perhaps writing , in a nonchalant , slightly amused , condescending , rich manner , and they would be intermittingly valuable because they would buy paintings , encourage concerts , read books . Some of the more serious ones might even be on the lookout for budding genius . But the inhabitants of St. John 's Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two clear-cut elements ; the majority who , although mostly native born , had no recognizable background , and a minority , good-looking young men and women who , like Harriet , were related to " the patrons " and " patronesses " by blood and were , despite all possible artistic intentions , Philadelphians first and artists second . Putting two and two together  --  what he had heard , what he was now observing  --  and sensitive as he was to atmospheres , it was clear to Felix that the umbilical cord had not been completely cut and never would be save in the case of some paragon . The shadow of the city was everywhere . The city was as strong as his own house , but far less gentle . You were what you were born and nothing in God 's world could change it . As a result , Felix concluded , artistic values and criticism must of necessity be darkly confused , much more even than elsewhere . There would be a lack of the knowledge that great art is a stark and solitary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of the word . He understood Harriet better . Those with talent and strength , but not common sense , would become intransigentrebels ; those with talent and strength and the necessary common sense would go somewhere else . He remembered what Carl had said on one of those final hot nights while he  --  Felix  --  had been waiting for the other members of the Van Sittart Expedition . Carl , turning from his preoccupation with the general unrest , had considered Philadelphia becauseFelix was going there , and Carl had been there , and Philadelphiaon the surface  --  although Carl hoped fervently not underneath  --  wasthe epitome of two great world forces as expressed in America . " There 's catholicism , " Carl had said , " and authoritarianism and , on the other hand , protestantism and democracy . The first two are color and painting ; the latter , mathematics and music . It takes a tremendous and passionate imagination to understand the passion and color of democracy and protestantism . They 're like the fugues of Bach . Their underlying motif and all their variations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of men do n't want to be men , they want to be trained and tended animals . Anyway , in Philadelphia , you 'll have a chance to observe something , Felix  --  something extremely interesting and of vital importance . I observedit during my few years there . I came to no conclusions , I merely continue to ask . " Quakerism is the purest form of protestantism , and democracy and protestantism are the two purest , and therefore noblest , conceptionsthat have ever entered the human mind . In Philadelphia , which is in America , those two conceptions landed and had an unimpeded chance . You will be interested to see what has happened to them there . I am glad to say , I think they have done better elsewhere . But why did they fail in Philadelphia ? Philadelphia hack every chance . Philadelphia could have produced a real Samurai class dedicated to all things fine and brave and beautiful . To courage , to vision , to actual Americanism . There could have been a flower there , steadily expanding , steadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There could have been the flower there of American civilization . "  |p335Carl  had hastened to make himself clear . " I have been speaking of catholicism and protestantism , " he added , " with small initial letters , and not in a denominational sense . I have no intention of criticizing in any way the great mother church . Denominations are merely various methods of reaching the same end . Real Catholicism  --  and now I am using a capital letter  --  is also real democracy , and has always been so understood by the great Catholics . It is only the small-minded who use authority to destroy individuality and democracy and personalprotestantism , which merely means  --  the last  --  that you talk to your god in private . " He had smoked for awhile in silence . " I am sick to death , " he continued , " of the stupid and un-botanicalbelief of the Communists and other revolutionists , and of not a few dull or tired democrats , that flowering always means decay , and so , as a consequence , that the flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the roots or the trunk or the stem , for it is the evidence of what those are . Scientifically , historically , socially  --  any way you want to look at it  --  the flower of a nation , its sturdiness , its color , its shape , is the most important symbol and actuality that nation has . I am afraid we have n't done very well so far , we Americans , although we 've done about as well as any one . But I 'm afraid we 'll have to begin once more with the knowledge we now have . " Carl had been silent again . " Philadelphia missed a great opportunity , " he concluded . And Mr. Wilde , in his own fashion , and speaking about something different but analogous as such things are , had made one of his numerous contributions to Felix 's knowledge of the city in which he had come to live . " Writers , " he said , " do n't seem to flourish in Philadelphia . I do n't know why , but they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that arise by spontaneous combustion almost invariably flee . The atmosphere is not congenial to writing . Writers , unfortunately , have to use words and ideas , and there is a common assumption , quite unfounded on fact , that every one uses words and has ideas . This misconception increases enormously when there is the equal one of supposed education . Eventually the two misconceptions harden into gelid amateurism . " Mr. Wildep336had grimaced . " Almost every one in Philadelphia goes to college , " he added . " Do n't misunderstand me , I 'm all for amateurism if it means intelligent knowledge and appreciation , even occasional harmlessproduction , but I 'm all against it if it means the bland belief that if you had the time , or wished to condescend , you could do somethingequally well , even better , yourself . The latter leads to arrogance and self-conceit , is n't that so ? " He had cocked his head at Felix . " The amateur searches for and applauds the esoteric , delighted no one else can understand it . The fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fact that he himself is a non-producer . He forgets that the object of the artist is universal and clear expression . " Mr. Wilde had been secretly amused . " At one time or another , " he resumed , " practically every well-bred Philadelphianhas written a novel or carved a statue , pour passer le temps , as it were , or merely to prove themselves . Painters and especially musicians seem to do better , but then they practice comparativelysecret arts , the latter particularly , and all they want as a rule is to live in colonies and to be patronized , quietly and politely . The writer has to stand on his own feet and is open to all the four winds that blow . In Philadelphia they blow pretty strongly . " Mr. ' Wilde was again secretly amused . " Writers , " he said , " I take it , have to be rebels  --  the serious ones . They always have been . Originalself-expression is bound to be rebellion  --  constructive rebellion . Rebellion does n't get much chance among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started , it is usually twenty years or so late . The rebellions of Philadelphia are invariably a couple of decades behind the times . " He hastened to disclaim authority . " Of course I know nothing , " he said , " but I 've read a great deal and , like you , I 'm omnivorous . " Felix stood in the doorway and drank in the damp warm air . Behind him the Buccaneer 's Rest rocked with noise . A moon had come up over St. John 's Street , hidden behind the houses to the east , but its light fell into the narrow byway . Felix turned his head and looked to the north and to his surprise saw about ten feet away , at the corner of the house , two figures sitting on the pavement , their backs straight against the wall , their legs stuck out in front of them . The figures were of a girl in evening dressp337and a boy in dark trousers and a sweater . They seemed to have no communication . Either the girl and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the doorway and walked quietly toward the two figures and looked down . " I had no idea you were at this party , " he said to the girl . " What 's wrong ? " She raised smoky blue confused eyes in the half-light and laughed incredulously . Felix 's heart sank . " You must be damned nearsighted , " she said scornfully . " I saw you with Harriet Wilde . Help me up . I 'm ill  --  no , I 'm drunk  --  or almost . Or else sit clown . This is a nice place to sit . This boy and I found it . " She glanced with heavy lids at her companion . Between him and her on the pavement was a wicker tray in which were half a dozen bunches of dejected violets , their stems wrapped in silver foil . " This boy , " she announced , " is an Italian . His name is Gabriele Montesanti and his family came to this country to better themselves . They used to sell violets in Naples . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be fifty cents in debt , and his father will beat him . Life is lousy , is n't it ? Sit down . " " No , " said Felix , " we 'll walk . Come on  --  get up . It 'll do you good . Why did n't you speak to me , if you saw me with Harriet ? " " I did n't want to speak to anybody . " " Why did you come to the party ? " " God knows . " The boy slewed his eyes around but did not move . Mavis looked at him and laughed . " We 're both waifs , " she said . Felix took a dollar out of his pocket . " Here , " he said to the boy . " Go home . " He stooped down and gathered up the violets and held them in his hand . The boy arose and without a word shuffled down St. John 's Street . " Grateful , " commented Felix , " is n't he ? " Mavis made a scornful sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ? " " Get up , " said Felix gently , " and we 'll walk around the block . " " No . " " Get up , and stop being a damned fool . " She lifted her head and stared at him , and then arose obediently .   " I hope you have n't spoiled your pretty gold dress , " said Felix . " Here  --  take my arm . . . . What 's the matter with you , anyway ? " " It 's dreadful , " she said , " to try to sell violets and not sell them , and its dreadful to want to paint pictures and not be able to paint them . " She turned upon Felix fiercely . " Ca n't you see that , you damn fool ? Why do you ask questions ? " " Oh shut up , " said Felix . I 'm beginning to learn to talk to girls , he thought . He pressed her arm firmly under his and set out north along St. John 's Street , crossing Locust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserted ; it was well past midnight . At Walnut he turned west to Thirteenth and then up Thirteenth to where CassianutStreet cut through . He walked slowly , Mavis close to him . Their footsteps sounded loud . He guided her into Cassianut Street . " How about a bromo-seltzer ? " he suggested . " There 's a drugstore on Twelfth Street . Would you like a bromo-seltzer ? " She shook her head sullenly . " No . I hate bromo-seltzers . Do you think I 'm drunk ? " " No , not drunk . But I think you 're tired and have been drink-ing . " " I feel better now . " They had come to Felix 's house and he glanced up at its darkness . It stood there shadowy and erect . It 's seen a lot , he thought ; generation after generation of young people confused and not knowing what to do , and expressing their confusion in the particularway of their particular generation . And then , these same younger generations getting older , and not caring so much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much less important . I hope I 'll never get that way , he thought . I hope life will always seem important to me and that I 'll always feel confused by its importance . He tightened his arm against Mavis ' arm . He wondered why this girl was so desperately unhappy at times . She did not fool him . He knew her too well by now . Several times since that first meeting , she had come to have tea with him , and they had sat on the porch and talked just as they had the first afternoon ; and twice he had gone to her studio . She was a fine girl  --  sensitive , thoughtful , ambitious.  | " I suppose , " she said , and her voice was n't blurred any longer , " you think I 'm a slut , do n't you ? " Felix chuckled . " A slut ? What 's that ? Describe one . " " Well  --  a woman who drinks too much . " She hesitated . " A woman who quite cold-bloodedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felix turned his head and looked at her . Abruptly he was finding himself again in a web of cross purposes . " Who are you talking about ? " he asked . " About me  --  about you . " Felix 's voice was incredulous . " About me ? About you ? " He shook his head . " You do n't drink too much . Every now and then you drink because something bothers you . It 's a poor way of getting rid of it , but it is n't drinkingtoo much . As for the rest of it , I do n't know what you 're talking about . " " No ? " " No . " " Perhaps then I 'd better tell you . I do n't think I 'd do it if  --  " she mimicked him but not unpleasantly "  --  I had n't been drinking because something bothered me . " She looked at him , her smoky blue eyes grave . " Felix  --  " Her voice was thin , reluctant "  --  I do n't like men . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like most of them . A girl in my position learns a lot about men . She has to play a lone hand . If she 's wise she looks out for herself . But I like you . " Abruptly her manner changed and she shook his arm with hers impatiently . " Why do n't you make love to me ? Am I unattractive ? Other men do n't find me so . What 's the matter with me ? Hour after hour I 've sat on your porch with you and you have n't lifted a finger . Do I have to do it all ? We 're both independent ; we 're both free . We can do what we like . I know you 're fond of me . " She laughed a small laugh . " I might even marry you , if you asked me . " Felix breathed deeply ; his legs trembled . " You 've only been to see me a few times , " he said in an equally thin voice . " I wish you 'd come oftener . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot . He knew , as if she were telling him in so many words , that what she was saying had no real relation to what she thought and felt . It was some surface plan of hers . It was up in the extreme top of her head . It was the outcome of hard and reckless despair . But she had put herself in his power ; he had only to follow her lead . He thought of those lovely quiet hours on his porch , the spring dusk growing thicker , and the smell of the garden in his nose , and the sound of the trafficbeyond the brick wall diminishing with every quarter of an hour . This girl had been one of the few women who had not frightened him . She was too lucid and candid and interested . He had been convinced of that rare thing between a man and a woman , a real and profitable friendship . She did not frighten him now , not really , after the first shock ; what she had said , properly analyzed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took her at her word , he could turn growing and profitable friendship into somethinghot and in the end dismaying , even if temporarily ecstatic . No , it would not even be temporarily ecstatic ; not as things were . Perhaps , eventually , out of this friendship something deep might come , but if it were to come , it would come , and this would be the best of ways to spoil it . He did not know what to do . His thoughts ran around in his mind like tiny creatures with inquiring eyes . Suddenly he decided . " All right , " he said solemnly , " I think you 're a splendid person . I suppose I 'll have to marry some day . I 'm agreeable . But it 's a serious business . I suppose I have a right to inquire if you love me . " He looked at her steadily . Her eyelashes covered her eyes as if she were thinking deeply ; then her mouth parted in a faint smile . " Is this a proposal ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laying your life and fortune at my feet ? " " Yes , " said Felix stoutly , although he did n't feel stout . He was taking an enormous risk . Suddenly , to his vast relief , she threw her head back and laughed with delight , and turned to him , squeezinghis arm . " Oh , my darling , " she said . " How marvellous you are ! I adore you . It is impossible to tell you how much I adore you . I adore you more and more every time I see you , but I would n't marry you if you presented yourself to me on a silver plate . And I wo n't ever dop341anything else with you except adore you , either . Would you like to know why ? " She looked at him with wide , smoky blue eyes , completelyfriendly and amused . " Because I adore you . That 's why . I wo n't spoil anything . Forget it . I did n't mean it . I 'll never bother you again . You 're very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently , in your case , you have to be in love . " She turned her head away from him and looked down the shadowy reaches of Twelfth Street . " I wish everybody felt that way , " she said . " It 'd make a whole lot nicer world . " She turned to Felix again . " Only I 'd like you to know one thing . . . this is the first time I 've ever talked to a man just like this . I 'm not very good at it . And now take me back to that dreadful party and I 'll get my things and go home . I have to work tomorrow . I 'll feel like hell . " She made a little sound in her nose ; an affectionate sort of laugh . " You 're very noble . " She 's a grand girl , thought Felix . He felt uncomfortable and hypocritical . He knew he had not been noble , merely recklessly self-protective . No  --  that was not altogetherfair . He had wished also to preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street again and had turned down it toward the Buccaneer 's Rest . Abruptly Mavis reached over and took from Felix the withered violets he had been holding absentmindedlyin his hand . " Here ! Let me have those . " " But they 're dead , " objected Felix . She shook her head smiling . " No , " she said , " they 're lovely . "   " Here , " said he , " are the keys of two great wardrobes and of my strong-rooms . . . . Open them all , go into all and every one of them except that little closet . . . . " BLUEBEARD . . . THE SPRING of Philadelphia and eastern Pennsylvania had come and gone , and now early summer was in bloom . It was not the early summer of the South , pastel blue and pensive horizoned , nor was it the early summer of New York State or New England , edged with the receding crispness that follows winters intimate with snow , but it was the more placid summer of the Middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would drive no lover mad with ecstasy or the sorrow of delight , but it would make married lovers for awhile content with habit . In the air was a sort of Quaker complacency . A white and yellow early summer , this summer of eastern Pennsylvania , promising enormous fruitfulness . In Felix 's garden crimson and striped and pink peonies had long been out , invaded by ants , and the magnolia , after its burst of glory , had withdrawn into the reticence of dark and shining leaves . In the garden were veronica and poppies , too , and other early flowers . With June the rolling countryside around Philadelphiabegan to swell with approaching crops . Felix was amazed to discover how many trees were left in the city ; in back yards , along distant streets , in the too few parks , invariably called " squares "  --  Rittenhouse Square , Washington Square , Independence Square  --  and how bosky and luxuriant the trees were ; bosky far beyond most city trees . Huge fat squirrels with enormous tails , and completely tame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people fed them . What a rich soil it was ; fecund beyond measure . Too fecund . Too easy to live with and make a living from . None of the bitter bravery of the North , nor the meditative pleasant melancholy of the South . From various high windows in office buildings or the apartment rooms of newP343acquaintances , Felix could see the trees green among the endless brick and mortar , and little roof gardens that people had made on top of back buildings , complete , some of them , with shrubs and awnings and flowers and even picket fences . On these , the owners , in shorts and loose summer clothes , lounged and read and dined in the dusk after work . It was very charming . Mr. Wilde told Felix that Philadelphia was the greatest urban forest reserve in the world if one counted the trees of Fairmount Park ; greater even than Paris . That was an interesting thing to know . Felix was realizing , as he had realized many times before , and as all but the most unobservant realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a place , is a mood that can not be hurried . One 's mind for a long while walks gingerly like a hunting cat ; sniffing and inspecting , accepting and rejecting . The larger part of you stays behind waiting to hear good news from the smaller part that has gone ahead . Before that happens , the larger part of you is not where you are . In this the body plays a major role . You are not really at home until in the dark you can find your way instinctively , knowing the furniture , the angles , the stairs , the electric switches . It was not until the middle of June that Felix felt that he had always lived at I205 Cassianut Street . By now he had turned the attic back room into a study as he had said to Mr. Wilde that he would , and his reference library was in place , and a huge desk , and a dozen cabinets for photographs and specimens . The furniture was second-hand , worn and sufficiently ugly ; a lounge , chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in a neat or beautiful room . Over his shoulder when he sat at the desk fell a fine north light from the row of dormer windows . And when he was tired , he could stretch out on the dusty worn lounge . Felix had a talent for short , sharp sleep ; he could go to sleep anywhere at any time and wake up vigorously . He imagined that he could even go to sleep standing up , although he had never tried it . Mavis had fallen into the habit of coming to tea fairly often , once or twice a week . She and Felix would sit on the porch or stroll in the garden . Sometimes she called Felix up from the office , sometimes she dropped in unexpectedly . Sometimes she and Felix talked , often they were silent , occasionally they read . Felixp344had never imagined that a man and woman could be so companionable . When they sat on the porch they felt the pleasant and exciting sense of isolation one feels in a big city in summer . They established a habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his amazement , found himself being entirely frank and self-revealing , and he knew that the same thing was happening to Mavis . He was aware that both he and she were shy people fundamentally ; uneasy about giving themselves away . If it occurred to either that their relationship was unusual , neither of them mentioned it . These hours together were too pleasant , too rewarding ; they had come about too naturally . Discussion of them would have dimmed their innocence . Perhaps the finest thing Felix was learning was ordinary physical intimacy with a woman . Despite his meager and lopsided and ailing experience , he had set himself fairly early in life to learn and to accept with profound gratitude and respect women 's minds and spirits , but physically they had been aliens . He thought it wonderful and nice that Mavis so often sat in silence and knitted or at times brought material from the office to read or consider . Sometimes she would stay to dinner , and then Felix afterward would play by ear on the old square piano which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing room would come the smell of the garden . The new magazine had finally been called The Soothsayer . " Not such a terribly good name , " Mavis said , " but easy to remember and provocative . " She had sighed happily . " It 's going to be swell . " Felix was enraptured by this habitual and in a way indifferent feminine companionship . It was beautiful , he thought . The rustle of it , the faint perfume of it ; the footsteps . The occasional small sounds and movements . He had never realized how much habitual and casual feminine companionship warms and enhances everythingone thinks or does . He was particularly touched by the way in which Mavis , without excuse or subterfuge , used his bathroom . Like a great many American men he had a super-reserve in this respect and although his scientific training , if nothing else , told him otherwise , he had refused to meet squarely the fact that women were largely like himself . Every now and then he saw Harriet , who was still in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her parents , and occasionallyhe went to her studio but with some reluctance . Harriet wasP345not restful and enlarging as Mavis was . Almost always she was mildly antagonistic and mocking , and the curved amorphous figuresshe hacked out of wood depressed Felix . They were like the young men and women he met at her studio ; spiritually , that is . Harriet went in for extremes ; gigantism , or its opposite , minusculism ; elongation or obesity . Everything she did or said was slightly asymmetrical ; never by any chance was anything normal . Harriet liked geese with enormously long necks and she liked equally enormously fat crouching women . Harriet 's friends loved to run their hands up the necks of the geese or over the enlarged rumps of the women while delivering profound , but deliberately casual comments on art , life and politics . On a rainy afternoon in June , Felix had finally got around to exploring the " catch-all , " the garret storeroom , which was in the front of the house adjoining the room he had adopted for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disobeying her husband , or rather , he had felt like a conspirator against the quiet and finality of the past , for there is about looking through letters and diaries always something a little indelicate , almost obscene . The dead are defenseless , and their half-discarded litter is intimate and tawdry and pathetic in a way that the fine and accredited and wellusedfurniture passed on from generation to generation is not . Good taste , thought Felix , is dignified and self-contained , and stands by itself , but bad taste is hesitant and insecure and wistfullyhuman . Half-discarded litter means a mind not entirely made-up ; it means a mind standing between one conviction and another , and the rain and the dim light falling through the dusty windows of the storeroom  --  three dormers in a row as in the back room  --  added to Felix 's mood ; a mood meditative and a little sad and poignantly lonely . He was the heir of all this , and all these dead people were in him . He was the focus of countless lives , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not feel especially capable of carrying on what they had wanted . And what had they wanted ? The rain drummed on the sloping tin roof like the drumming of absent-minded fingers , and the garret was sticky and breathless with the warm wetness . Felix managed to open one of the longunopenedwindows . The air came in a little cooler .   The garret was filled with the illogical odds and ends left for the puzzlement of succeeding generations . In one corner two high floor lamps with crimson silk shades stood gray with dust , fringes of beaded glass tassels hanging down from them dejectedly . And beyond the lamps were a leather couch , the leather torn , and two leather Morris chairs . Staring at Felix were a couple of portraits of the eighties , incredibly bad , and several landscapes , turgid and confused . There were half a dozen boxes of books , many of them with faded paper covers , and three slim gilt chairs , curiously tortured , and designed for almost any purpose except to be sat on ; and two high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a moose head , one eye gone so that it had a leering insolentstare . There was much other trash , mournful and as if waiting for something that would never happen , but what interestedFelix were the two old leather trunks and the three or four tin boxes . First , however , he took out some of the stained and grimy books from their wooden boxes and glanced through them . Through the decades the books ran : Marion Crawford , Robert Hichens , Robert Grant , Mrs. Humphry Ward  --  a score of other writers . And then farther back , books with such quaint titles as Piety Promoted , Industry and Idleness , and Always Happy , by a Lady . Most of them were novels , and Felix 's gentle melancholy increased . So much work had gone into these books , so much thought and training and effort , and in their day they had moved the minds and hearts of men and women , and had been vivid , and people had discussed them , but now no one gave them a thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their respective periods readers had gradually discarded them . Over one book Felix lingered and chuckled as he had over Mr. Bigland 's natural history and the Thirteenth Century Encyclopedia . This was a thick book , a novel entitled , The Quaker City , or the Monks of Monk Hall . And the subtitle was , " A Romance of Philadelphia Life , Mystery and Crime , " and on the fly-leaf was the quotation , " Woe unto Sodom . " George Lippard apparently had been a novelist of repute and popularity in the forties and fifties , the author of such best sellers as Paul Ardenheim , the Monk of Wissahickon , and Blanche of Brandywine . A darkly imaginative and highly-colored fellow obviously , born in 1822 , deceased in 1854 , who had startled his fel-P347low citizens by tenebrous and extravagant revelations about their supposedly quiet city , and who had surrounded his own life with appropriate mystery . One of his exploits had been the founding of " The Brotherhood of the Union , " of which he was " The Supreme Washington . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conveyedthe news that no American novel had " ever commanded so widespread an interest as this work , " which apparently had been the subject of criticism wherever the English language was spoken . On the one hand , the advertisement continued , The Quaker City had been denounced as a work of the most immoral and incendiary character ; on the other , elaborately praised as a painfully vivid picture of life in the metropolis . George Lippard took his readers immediately into his confidence . " The motive which impelled me to write this work , " the introduction read , " may be stated in a few words . I was the only Protector of an Orphan Sister . I was fearful that I might be taken away by death , leaving her alone in the world . I know too well the law of society which makes a virtue of the dishonor of a poor girl , while it justly holds the seduction of a rich man 's child as an infamous crime . These thoughts impressed me deeply . I determined to write a book founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poor and innocent girl is a deed altogetheras criminal as deliberate murder . It is worse than the murderof the body , for it is the assassination of the soul . If the murdererdeserves death by the gallows , then the assassin of chastity and maidenhood is worthy of death by the hands of any man , and in any place . " The introduction ended with these portentous words : " Would God that the evils recorded in these pages were not based upon facts . Would God that the experience of my life had not impressed me so vividly with the colossal vices and the terrible deformities presented in the social system of the large city , and in the nineteenthcentury . " Reading here and there , Felix came to the conclusion that in the imagination of Mr. Lippard , at least , the streets of Philadelphia , especially Chestnut Street , after dark in the 184o 's , had been crowded , and nightly , by young " bucks " inflamed by brandy , dressed in top hats and white greatcoats , intent solely upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Felix reflected , and whatever other criticisms one might bring , Philadelphiawas no longer quite like that . Refreshed , his quiet melancholya little lifted , Felix placed The Quaker City on top of a trunk for further inspection and opened the first of the tin boxes . All that afternoon , he read and the next afternoon as well , although the next afternoon the rain had ceased and the afternoon was a quiet , clear-blue afternoon with a little breeze stirring in the garret . For the first time , Felix achieved a distinct and ordered picture of his family ; its essential traits . He was glad that he had finally inspected the garret . Here was a clan , a strong , continuing human strain , which quietly , obstinately , conservatively , and for the most part warily , had made its way , and preserved itself , and added in an unspectacularfashion to its fortunes , through two centuries and more of tumultuous occasions . Almost always the majority of the members of the clan had weighed events , taken their time , refused leadership until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the successfulside , but in each generation also there had been some " ugly duckling , " rebellious , obstinate , and inclined toward gallantry . And these intractable people stood out like threads of gold and scarlet in the sober and rich and well-made family cloth of silver gray . How account for them ? Were they due to the introduction of other blood ? The Welsh and Scotch strains introduced by the marriages of the original Felix Bartain shortly after his arrival in 1 720 and of his eldest son , another Felix , twenty years later ? And the introduction , in the thirties , of Peyton blood from South Carolina , and in the fifties of Morris blood from New York ? Anyway , there they were , these intractable people , but always also there was the dominant theme , the recurrence ; the return of the original tough , observant , cautious French bourgeois blood , the toughest and most persistent blood in the world . Sinewy , ungallant and reasonable . For example , there had been a Thomas Bartain , a son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne Wars . . . he had left no letters , but he was mentioned . And in the following generation , there had been a Peter Bartain , a captain in the China trade which , for the most part , had little to do with Philadelphia . P349And then there had been the famous Felix Bartain whose miniaturewas in the library . He was the older brother of Peter . Twice the lightning had struck in that brood . And coming closer , within Felix 's own memory of family traditions , there had been a greatuncle , a Morris Bartain who had fought and died in the Civil War when most of his kin had done everything else but that , and Morris had had a sister , Felix 's great-aunt Celeste , who had died of blood-poisoning caught from a wounded soldier while she was working in the Sanitary Corps , the Red Cross of that period . And then  --  Felix thought of his own mother . Felix 's mother had been one of the intractable ones , although of gentle clay . As a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original Felix , the reserved and sallow botanist , or he would not have left the comparative security of France for the uncertainties of a new land . Families were interestingand mysterious things , were n't they ? A family , thought Felix , is like a symphony . It has its underlying structure , its prevailing theme , its recurrent motifs ; its aspirations , its hesitations , and its surrenders ; its new motifs introduced each generation by marriage . If the original theme is strong enough , it absorbs and uses the new motifs and strains , but if it is n't , the original symphony is ended and a new one begins , or else the symphony goes entirely to pieces . He was not altogether proud of his family . For the most part the members of it had been too self-protective , and the intractable and gallant ones , to judge by letters and diaries , had not always been considerate or admirable . Frequently they had nursed and protected at all human costs their gallantry as much as their brothersand sisters , and fathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow aggrandizement . A strong race , thought Felix , but not a completely lovable one . Only the famous Felix had seemed able to combine gallantry and daring with wisdom ; wit and vision and color with intelligent self-protection . And was n't that the ideal ? And why did n't more people perceive it ? Was n't far-visioned insouciant but keenly observant bravery invariably the recipe for real success ? After all , was n't the famous Felix by far the most successful of the Bartains ? In an American there was something irritating and nationally wrong about the attitude of blind and molelike caution . America had been settled by gallantry . It could go forward , it could continue , only through gallantry . It was too big , too wide for anything else . The mood was inherent in the flag ; the gallant striped affair , whipping in the wind , stars in the corner . It was n't fair , not logical , was it , to come gallantly to a country and then settle down and be ungallant all the rest of your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read all that rainy afternoon and the next afternoon . He went carefully through the contents of the boxes ; the letters and papers they contained . For the most part the papers were of little interest ; deeds mostly , or contracts , or annual accounts of incomesor investments long since antedated . The two leather trunks were also a disappointment ; they were stuffed with newspapers , old magazines , old photographs . Some of these might have a certainhistorical value , but Felix could not be bothered . He decided he would get in an expert from the Historical Society and present to that storehouse , of which he found himself automatically a member , everything of worth including all but the most personal of the varied Bartain correspondence , and as a matter of fact , even that might go . Surely there was no safer place to preserve the secrets of the dead than in the files of a historical society . And knowing by now his family , Felix did not believe there were many very revealingsecrets in the tin boxes . He had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone up various chimneys on the flames of open fires . But toward the end of the first afternoon he came across two love letters of his grandfather , the awesome , handsome man with a white moustache , to his bride shortly after their marriage , and shortly afterward he came across his grandfather'sdiary ; ten small volumes bound in morocco . Odd that they should have been there . There must have been carelessness on the part of some one . Felix gathered that his grandfather had gone to New York on a business trip . " My darling little wife , " both the letters began . Felix did not read them through . That would have been like undressing the dead , but he did see a final sentence : " I can not wait , " it said , " until I kiss again your lips , your hands . " Oh God , that was sad and revealing and reassuring . Sad because the emotion was gone as well as those who had felt it . Revealing and reassuring because , generation after generation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and because the words were so old , and not to be improved upon , and millions of men , not even as yet born , would think and say them . And these words had been written to the little old lady in a lace cap whom Felix remembered  --  a character out of Thackerayor Dickens  --  sitting by a sunny window in the room his uncle had changed into a private study . And they had been written by the awesome man with the white moustache . For the first time in his life , Felix rather liked his grandfather  --  for a moment . He had no hesitancy reading his grandfather 's diary . For fifty years his grandfather had kept a journal , a day-book  --  from 1865 to 1915 , the year of his death . Every day he had put down a few lines in his clear spencerian hand . There was a quaint lack of emphasis ; of discrimination . " July 3 , 1881 . Peaches up two cents . Bought bushel basket . Butter 15  --  lb . Cousin Helen ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lb. boy this morning ; 2:30 A.M. Both doing well . President James A. Garfield fatally shot yesterday by Anarchist at Baltimore and Potomac Railway Depot , Washington . Unfortunate . Excellent man ; conservative and a gentleman despite humblebeginnings . Weather fair and hot . Ther . Max 89  --  " But a most valuable document , none the less , thought Felix ; these fat small volumes . He would certainly turn this diary  --  this day-book  --  over to the Historical Society . The very lack of emphasis , the material details , increased the worth . Here was ordinaryliving for five decades . Abruptly Felix came upon mention of his mother . The blood surged up into his cheeks , and then left them cold . In the growing dusk he read the short and pitiful tale . " May 10 , 1894 . New York City . lo A.M. Just seen Mary that was Felix 's grandmother and Adele off for Italy . S.S. Teutonic White Star . Excellent boat . Twin-screw . Pleasant passenger list apparently . Saw old friend George Vandergrift and wife of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in prospects of study : Milan ; singing . Odd to lose wife and daughter for year . Lydia with me . Clear and cool . Breeze in harbor . Ther . Max 72  --  . Lydia and I return Philadelphia tomorrow . " There was no further mention of the voyagers for a month , and then under the date of June 9 was this note :  | " Boxelder , York Co. , Pa . Boxelder had been Felix 's grandfather'scountry place , long ago sold . Lengthy letter from Mary this morning . She and Adele comfortably settled in villa outside Milan . Adele has started her lessons . Mary worried about Adele 's health . Asks if I will not send for young Macalister and explain impossibility of marriage . Evidently he continues to write Adele . Now in Baltimore . Embarrassing prospect . . . . " Why was the marriage impossible , Felix asked himself , thinking of his father . Four pages later were the bald , almost short-hand notes of the interview . . . June 28 , 1894 . But there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Macalister consented to interview , " he had written . " Arrived yesterday . Spent night , has just left . Impression of him unchanged . Smiling , obstinate , inclined to be insolent . Do not like accent . Unable to discover , as usual , what Adele finds in him . Lengthy discussion . Explained absurdity of situation . For a while recalcitrant . Had difficulty controlling temper . Eventually stated unfairness of penniless inventor , utterly impoverished scion of Georgia family , hampering and ruining girl 's life . Asked if that was conception of affection . Seemed to have immediate effect . This morning said he would write Adele relinquishing her , but added impertinent and outrageous proviso , to wit ; should Adele marry , the moment his affairs were in shape , he would write her husband , whoever and wherever he was , giving fair warning that Adele belonged to him and he was on his way to claim her . Monstrous ! " Felix could see the look in his grandfather 's eyes when he had written the word " monstrous ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of the interview his father had been only twenty . Mr. Bartain had proceeded . This was a long entry . Felix 's father had tried to explain how he felt apparently . Mr. Bartain had thought the explanation " poppy-cock . " Unbearably sentimental . Vaporings of a hotheaded , impractical youth . These Southerners ! Mr. Bartain had been angrily amused . Felix 's father had announced his belief that there actually was in the world one woman for one man . Usually they did n't meet , but in his and Adele 's case they had , so it was final . Mr. Bartain extracting a promise , had had to be careful , although he would have liked toP353say a good deal . One man for one woman ! Once again poppy-cock ! That was the oldest delusion in the world ! Well , time would take care of the situation . Youth thought such things ; maturity knew better . Time healed all wounds , especially puppy-love . If Macalister lived up to his word , Mr. Bartain would write Adele such a letter that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and his slow self-assured drawl , and his insolent smiling eyes ! Mr. Bartain had been satisfied with his day 's work . The afternoon , and evening , and morning had been embarrassing ; he had had difficulty keeping his temper ; but he had saved his daughter 's future . The fool , thought Felix . All the fools who all through the ages had tried to do the same thing , including the Capulets and Montagues ! Love was a thing that had to be worked out by the people engaged in it . Wrong or right , foolish or wise , advisable or inadvisable , if approached by others , it had to be approached with the most delicate precision and forethought , or else perpetual scars were left , no matter what the ending . Felix told himself he knew little about love , but he at least knew that . Love was a serious business , for a while at least . It was a chemical and spiritual mystery that no one knew the least thing about , in particular those affected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two letters his grandfather had written from New York . Why was it that when people recovered from an emotion they no longer believed in it ; neither in themselves nor in others ? The story of Felix 's mother developed . Felix picked it up here and there through his grandfather 's day-books . Felix 's mother had done well with her singing . In the garret , the dusk coming , and the faint breeze , not moving noticeably , but touching Felix 's forehead like a passing hand , Felix remembered the lilting , laughingvoice . Yes , she could have done well in coloratura songs . There had even been a hint of the opera , although Mr. Bartain disapproved of that . . . " his daughter ! " . . . And then , two years later , in 1896 , she had met the young Italian . By now Mrs. Bartain had come home  --  she had stayed only a year in Italy  --  and Felix 's Aunt Lydia had taken her place . Mr. Bartain approved of the young Italian . He had had him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this was a bona fide one ; the Borghesi were an ancient and respected family of Cremona , and curiously enough they had money and estates . This young Vittorio was clearly not wanting to marry Adele for her chance of an income . Well , that was a relief . Lucky too , for Mr. Bartain did not approve of the French dot . If a young man could n't support a wife , then he should n't attempt to marry . Adele had had one experience of that sort with a penniless Southerner . This new development had all the earmarks of a real love affair ; a sensible marriage . Adele and Lydia had come home in July and in September Adele and Vittorio Borghesi were married at " Boxelder , " up in York County . A very pretty wedding . Adele had seemed happy ; quiet but romantic . The only thing that worried Mr. Bartain was that Borghesi was not satisfied with being an Italian prince and a well-to-do one , but insisted also upon being a professor , a historian . It seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lightning had struck , and to Mr. Bartain it had seemed incredible . This Donald Macalister  --  this obstinate and insolent Southerner  --  had done exactly what he had said he would . He had even had the indecency to write Mr. Bartain a letter giving him fair warning . Mr. Bartain , in amazement , quoted some of it  --  obscene , he thought it , unbelievable . " I am now , " Felix 's father had written , " in a position to support your daughter at least decently . . . . I am sailing for Italy at once . To me this is a matter of lifelong importance and I trust that it is still the same to Adele . If it is , she is not giving Borghesi what she should give him , for I understand he is a fine fellow . The situation is not fair to any one . If I know her at all she has done her best to please you and satisfy your delusion , twice repeated when I saw you six years ago , that time heals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing could be more false . If Borghesi no longer loves Adele , then the solution is simple ; if he still loves her , then she is betraying him under a mistaken sense of duty in the most subtle way a woman can betray a man  --  far more wounding and deteriorating in the long run than actual betrayal , for Borghesi , no doubt , given a chance , can find his real love as I have found mine . . . . Anyway , I shall see him andp355lay the matter before him with the utmost candor , that is , if I discover , as I have n't the slightest doubt I will , that Adele feels as she did six years ago . . . . " This time Mr. Bartain had lost his temper . " Unbearable ! " he had written with a deep black exclamation mark . " I shall cable Adele at once ; I shall also write Vittorio . I hope he has the fellow arrested . I shall do my best to prevent this . I wish the duel was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Four pages later Mr. Bartain had written , April 21 , 1900 , incredulously : " The world is going mad ! Borghesi has joined the conspiracy . He is a willing cuckold . He has written me . He says that he thinks Adele and Macalister are right . That he has always missed something in Adele , and that he is glad , although heartbroken , to know what it is . He says that he has given her her liberty , but only on condition that if she accepts it , she will leave at once . To have her about would be too much . " Borghesi had spoken regretfully of the difficulties of obtaining a divorce . He would seek an annulment and hoped an annulment would be possible . Italy in this respect was anachronistic ; meanwhileAdele could obtain an American divorce . In his anger and amazement , Mr. Bartain for a few sentences had become lyric . " Heartbroken indeed ! " he had snorted . " The man is mad ! I have never heard of such a thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of possession ? Borghesi , were he a man , would beat her . What are we witnessing ? The break-down of civilization ? Or is this indeed the fin de siecle ? One thing at all events is certain ; I shall never see any of the three again . Adele is no longer a child of mine . " Two threats , Felix reflected , that could not have been more wrong . The light was fading , so Felix went back into his study , taking George Lippard 's The Quaker City with him . He had again that sense of time not being time ; of time not being anything . In reality time was what was in your head , was n't it ? And what was in your head was hardly ever the present . Men and women were merely the past walking into the future that in a little while became the past . " You are so lovely looking , " Felix heard his mother saying . " Oh , my darling . . . . So lovely looking . " P356There must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although few came across it . It was a pity more people did n't know enough to wait , or were n't clever enough to recognize love when it happened . The mere quick , hot desire of a boy for a girl  --  that was too bad . It was not the same thing at all . Felix felt lonely and depressed . There must be some lack in him that he had never fallen in love himself . . . . This house was terribly big and empty . Never in all his life had he felt for a moment anything like the emotion his father must have felt for his mother ; his mother for his father . P357Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mightyworks were done , because they repented not . ST . MATTHEWONE OF the first things Felix had done upon his arrival in Philadelphiahad been to call upon his Aunt Lydia and to his delight he had discovered that she was an old lady very much after his heart ; a tall , slim , long-waisted old lady who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pearl necklace at the throat , and who had slender sensitive hands and whose pure white hair was piled high on her head above direct blue eyes , often inquiring , frequently amused . Aunt Lydia ranked far up in Felix 's category of old ladies , and would have ranked even higher had there not been at times a trace of the family wariness ; a temporary revealment of a hard underlying vein . Felix decided that Aunt Lydia was trustworthy and delightful up to the point where her routine and her selfprotectivenesswere disturbed . He did not blame her . He came to the conclusion that she was a gallant Bartain whose gallantry had been truncated by a dull marriage and subsequent years of lonely concentration upon self . Early in life she had been wounded and so had become spirituallycautious . As a result , her mind was broad , worldly , humorousand kindly , but there were depths into which she did not like to go . Her gallantry had translated itself into her leading virtue , a gallant tolerance . " There is no use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his more pressing problems to her , especially his increasingworry about the stewardship of his estate . " There 's no use fighting . I discovered that long ago . Never fight ; never make a point of anything until you just have to in order to survive . No one will thank you , and you will merely involve yourself in endlesstrouble . No , my dear , the average person is moved only by an earthquake . " She sighed and looked down at her slender hands folded in her lap , white against the blackness of her dress . " Be/sides , who knows what is right ? Nothing is worth fighting for except bread and butter and a few other necessities such as sleep . " Felix was secretly amused . His aunt Lydia 's bread and butter were exquisite and wonderfully ordered . They had the punctual simplicity of wealth . Somebody had fought for them . He looked at her with wide , demanding eyes . " But I must do something , " he said . " I ca n't rest until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . I do n't mean I 've gone into most of them , but I 've looked at them from the outside and seen the neighborhoods they are in , and I 've asked Goodman and Hart , my real-estate agents , about them . At least thirty  --  perhapsfifty  --  are n't fit for human habitation . Another fifty may be safe enough , possibly even sanitary , if you take a low standard , but all of them , including fifty more , are on streets people should n't be called to live on . " His face was grim . " How do you expect , " he asked , " to make decent citizens , how do you expect not to make criminals , how do you expect to produce good Americans , if all they see or realize of the United States are my houses and millions like them ? Do you know , Aunt Lydia , that in my worst houses there is no running water except one cold tap used by every one ? And that they have only privies that are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too safe ? " " But I thought , " said his aunt Lydia , " that we had building inspectors ? " Felix shook his head . " We have , but not anywhere near enough . Besides , some of them can be bribed . " He warmed to the statistics he had recently been reading . " Aunt Lydia , the Philadelphia slums are among the worst in the world . Do you know that ? Listen to this ; it 's interesting . Do you know what Ribbon Areas ' are ? " His aunt Lydia , watching him quizzically , her blue eyes sympatheticbut faintly amused by his earnestness , made a negative gesture . " They are our most debased and unhealthy areas , and they run through the city everywhere . " Felix wrinkled his nose in disgust . " How can we sit down to breakfast , " he demanded , " with their smell in our noses ? They 're right at our back doors , too . Some of the worst of them are only a few blocks from here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands tightly locked . " Auntp359Lydia , fifty per cent of all the houses in these Ribbon Areas ' are sub-standard . Deaths from tuberculosis are twenty-two per thousandas compared to eight elsewhere . The percentage of arrests is four hundred and eighty-four per thousand for seventy-six in the rest of the city . Probation , twenty-six to four elsewhere ; hospital cases ninety-six to thirty-three , and so on , and so on . " Felix paused to catch his breath . " Crime costs this city five dollars and two cents per capita , " he resumed , " but in the Ribbon Areas ' it costs us thirty-one dollars and ninety-two cents , and the prison costs are two dollars and sixty-four cents per capita as opposed to thirty-one cents in other quarters . " He sat back in his chair . " And I 'm not even counting , " he said , " the cost of extra policemen , of fire risks and loss , of a steadily growing population of the insane . Hospital costs . The drain on charity . And above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He made a disgusted sound in his nose . " Aunt Lydia , nice people , despite our modern frankness , still do n't like the words incest , rape , syphilis , gonorrhea , do they ? And they dread the words robbery , murder and rebellion . Well , I 'd like to scrawl them on the walls of every trust company and office in this city , and on the walls of every huge country place and suburbanpalace ; and I 'd like to illumine them and hang them below the pulpit of every church . We call ourselves practical people . ' Those are nice figures for practical people , the ones I 've been giving you , are n't they ? " His manner changed and he smiled deprecatingly . " I become excited , " he explained . " I did n't know about these things until your brother left me his estate . " In the blue eyes of his aunt Lydia was the pleased expression with which intelligent women regard earnestness in men whom they like . " What does Mr. Wilde say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That adventitious , undirected personal charity is always a mistakeand accomplishes nothing . " Felix grinned . " Mr. Wilde is a well-read man , " he interjected . " He spoke of Ajax defying the lightning . If I thought all that true , I would n't want to live . " " And , what 's their name ?  --  Goodman and Hart ? Do they feel the same way ? "  | " Even more so . It 's purely a business proposition with them . They say if I fix these houses up , within six months they 'll be as bad as ever , and that if I fix them up too much , the present tenants will move away . Besides , I wo n't be able to rent my houses at a price where the tenants can sublet the rooms at three dollars and fifty cents a month . " Felix laughed shortly . " Three dollars and fifty cents a month ! It 's no easy problem . The principal objection seems to be that I 'll be putting ideas into people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear the houses down and try to give the land to the city for parks , the city could n't accept the gift as it 's so nearly bankrupt , and if I did , where would the present inhabitants of my houses go ? Aunt Lydia , poverty is a disease and can be cured only if looked upon that way . And like yellow fever , so long as it is in the world , every one is in danger of contagion , and even the most secure is actually poor . Poverty , like slavery , is even worse for the rich than it is for the poor . The moment a man accepts poverty as inevitable he 's done for spiritually . And there 'll be no cure until practical ' people become really practical and realize that the most impractical statement possible is the one that meets all sensible and far-visioned suggestion with the words not practical . ' The only difference between men and apes is that there 're always a few men who know how foolish that statementis . His aunt Lydia was thoughtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian ethics  --  the Golden Rule . . . That 's so . " She sighed . " How about another cup of tea ? " Felix 's aunt Lydia lived on upper De Lancey Street between Twentieth and Twenty-first streets , in a block of noble old houses , many of them double and with white carved doors . Trees still grow along the curbs of De Lancey Street , and in them country birds , such as vireos , still nest and sing . Most of the houses in this part of De Lancey Street have hidden and spacious back gardens upon which their dining rooms and second-story sitting rooms give . De Lancey Street is a curious street . It runs from east to west almost from the Delaware to the Schuylkill in a series of disconnectedblocks , some of these blocks quiet and demure and dignifiedlike the block in which Felix 's aunt Lydia lived , others a series of reconstructed stables turned into studios or apartments ,  |p361others  mere alleys down which cats slink . Often the name De Lancey Street pops out at you unexpectedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street is like a streak of good hard lean in the fat disorder of the city ; where it has been preservedor reconstructed it is one of the few actual residence districtsleft in that part of town which was once the heart of Philadelphia . To the north is Spruce Street , always , in contradistinctionto De Lancey Street , dreary , now crumbling before the increasingblows of doctors ' offices and boarding houses ; to the south is Pine Street , equally dreary , and beyond Pine the great mixed teeming population of South Philadelphia  --  a Negro quarter with its huge and for the most part hopeless population , standing and loitering , an Italian quarter , a Jewish quarter , and then amorphousslum after slum where there is a bewildering mixture of races and occupations and intentions . Every now and then there are well-kept sections , startlingly clean and quiet , but South Philadelphiaas a whole seems like a morass where some promise has bogged down . Felix , unlike most of his countrymen , loved to walk . He thought perhaps he had inherited this passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . If you walked alone you could think , and you were pleasantly aware of the muscles of your legs , and of oxygen entering your lungs , and above all , you could observeyour surroundings . Felix liked to walk in a city as much as in the country . If you walked alone in a city you had a marvelous feeling of being part of something and yet sufficiently removed for observation and reflection , and Felix had discovered that in many parts of Philadelphia , especially the older parts , you could still walk with some degree of comfort . The streets of Philadelphiaare on the whole narrow and it is still possible for reflective men or women to cross them without too much risk of death . Almost every afternoon , rain or shine , Felix would stop work around four o'clock and take a walk . Sometimes he walked in the older parts of the city where he had walked so often with his father , sometimes he explored South Philadelphia . In South Philadelphiahe liked the Italian quarter best , filled , now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy  --  dirty awnings out , pushcarts heaped high with vegetables , the sweetly sour smell of red wine , and hard bread , and macaroni ; huge-bosomed women fanning themselves in doorways cool with shadows . Felix would stop in at some small trattoria for a glass of wine and the end of a loaf with cheese . Pretty soon he got to know several of the proprietors , them and their wives . He had always liked Italians . He recognized their especial virtues and was not taken in by modern braggadocio . The Italians were an amiable people who lived in the sun and who smelled of the earth but the earth suncleaned . They were inherently civilized , even the most ignorant of them , because all they wanted was to like and be liked and to live on their land according to their various degrees of wealth . While Felix was talking to these Italian-Americans , he was constantlytouched and interested by their efforts to reconcile what they knew and thought of America , what they knew and thought of the earth , with the strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome . For a thousand years the Italians had been trying to learn better . Every now and then after one of these walks , Felix would drop in at his aunt Lydia 's for tea . Aunt Lydia stayed in town until late in June and returned to town from her unwilling retreat in the mountains of Maryland as early as possible . Like most civilized people she detested the average summer resort . " I do n't know why I go to Chasm Gap at all , " she complained , " except that it 's a habit , and Dorgan can drive me there in a day , and it 's a good place in which to watch Virginians . " She reflected happily about the last . " Virginians , " she resumed , " are the only people in the land as peaceably snobbish as Philadelphians , except Bostonians , and in none of the three cases can one discover what it is all about . " Her eyes glinted wickedly and her chin shot out . " I like to put Virginians in their place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Chasm Gap , that is  --  is a sort of museum piece , anyway . A survival of the Civil War . It permits an old woman like myself to reflect that terrible as the present is , in some ways it is an improvement upon the past . " From the cool afternoon in April when he had first entered his aunt 's house , Felix retained an impression of open fires and twinkling brass fenders , of delicately perfumed warmth and soft lights ; but as it grew warmer , to this first impression was added one of windows opening upon a back garden and the smell of chintz so noticeable in hot weather . Felix liked the way his auntP363always had roses scattered around her rooms in silver or glass vases . He thought his uncle Felix had been unfair to his sister . . . . Aunt Lydia liked two cocktails after her tea  --  Martinis  --  and sometimes when she was especially interested , three , but Felix admiredthe way brightness came into her blue eyes and soft color into her cheeks and quickness into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tender toward them . After all , if you have only ten or fifteen more years to live at the most , it is only right , is n't it , to try to approach heaven with some degree of aplomb ? And if this aplomb is heightened by mild indulgence in alcohol , why not ? There are various ways of becoming intimate with angels , or thinking yourself one temporarily . Nor did Felix notice , where he was concerned , any of the quarrelsome traits at which his uncle had hinted . Instead , his aunt Lydia sparkled and mellowed . He imagined that in a reserved way his uncle Felix had often been profoundly irritating ; brothers can be . When , however , and extremely rarely , his aunt insisted upon a fourth cocktail , Felix drank it hastily and refused her invitation to stay to dinner . His aunt was quietly delighted by Felix and his sudden accessionto fortune . Felix was aware of a steadily growing affection on her part , an attitude he reciprocated , but with the affection was also evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm so glad , " said his aunt , " that my late husband , whatever his other faults , left me comfortably off . There is nothing more terrible than a family quarrel over money . I do not grudge you a cent . I was able to greet you without arriere-pensee or the slightesttwinge of jealousy . Even the deepest family affection can not withstand the shock of disinheritance . " She looked at Felix with shrewd eyes . " I suppose of course , you will marry soon ? " Felix sighed inwardly . " I 'm in no hurry . In fact , I think I 'm a predestined bachelor . " His aunt Lydia smiled in a superior fashion . " Nonsense . Moreover , it 's your duty now . It 's the duty of all men with an income to take at least one woman off relief , family or public . Besides , how otherwise will we perpetuate the family ? " She was meditative for a moment . " Not that that . matters so much , " she decided . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But for your own future it is really imperative . Bachelors shouldp364be taxed out of existence in the same way men with too many children should be taxed out of existence . There should be moderationin everything . " She looked at Felix again shrewdly . " Is there some girl in North Carolina ? There must be . " Felix shook his head firmly . " Not a one . " Aunt Lydia sighed with mock desperation . " I do n't know what to do with you , Felix . I really do n't . I think I will have to pick some girl out for you myself . Although I need n't worry . They 'll pick themselves out . Women have their ambitions as well as men , and fifty thousand a year  --  or whatever it is  --  is nothing to be sniffed at . My only fear is that being the sort of person you are , some quite unscrupulous hard-hearted young thing will get hold of you . " " You think I 'm guileless ? " asked Felix . His aunt Lydia laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of fact , I think you are slyly , if unconsciously , well able to take care of yourself so long as your sympathies are not involved . Then I think you 'd marry any one rather than wound them . Be careful , Felix , never to become involved with a girl you do not love deeply , but who might fall deeply in love with you . " Felix narrowed his eyes at her thoughtfully . This was the first time he had ever heard her speak with such unguarded conviction . " Then you believe in complete and utter love ? " She looked down at her hands and then up . " Yes , " she said . " Of course . It is one of the few things I really do believe in . But it is rare . Most people know nothing about it . " Felix reached over and put his empty tea cup on the little table separating him from his aunt . His aunt astonished him . " Did you know Vittorio Borghesi well ? " he asked . " What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and stared . " You mean , what do I think of him , " she said finally . " He is still alive . At least , so far as I know . " She rested an elbow on the arm of her chair and lowered her chin to the vee made by her middle and forefingers , staring at Felix reflectively . " Why do you ask ? " " I 've been reading my grandfather 's diary , " said Felix . " Yourp365father 's diary . I came across it in a trunk in the garret at 1205 Cassianut Street . " " You did ? That 's queer . It must have been there by mistake . He was a very secretive man  --  your grandfather , my father . So he told all about Vittorio and your mother , did he ? " Felix nodded . " And what did you think ? " " I thought , " said Felix , " that it was interesting . Here were two men , apparently , who loved my mother equally . Both with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out by renunciation and the other by an obstinate refusal to accept what had hap-pened . " " Exactly , " said his aunt . " Exactly . " She nodded her head . " But you see your mother was in love with your father and not with Vittorio Borghesi . " She smiled faintly , her eyes still meditative . " It is a question that will never be answered who loved your mother the more . Perhaps it is an unfair question because the circumstanceswere different , but it takes a great love , the rarest kind of love , to give up a person because her happiness is more important to you than your own . " She was deeply thoughtful , looking down at her hands . " Most so-called love , " she resumed , " is selfish , like most so-called religion . Real religion and real love are the same  --  they are self-forgetful . " She was silent , looking away from Felix . She looked back , holding his eyes steadily . " You want to hear about Vittorio Borghesi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You feel almost as if he were another father , do n't you ? " " Yes  --  in a way . " " Well , that 's natural . " Aunt Lydia 's voice became narrational . " Vittorio Borghesi , " she said , " was one of the finest and most endearing persons I have ever met . One of the most charming . Or rather , as I have said , still is , I imagine , one of the finest and most endearing , for he is still alive , although how he has got along in the present turmoil I do n't know . I hear from him a couple of times every year briefly . " She hesitated . " Let 's see how I can best describe him . " She knit her brows . " Well , to begin with , he was , and I 've no doubt still is , the most generous and fair-minded and civilized person I 've ever met . For one thing , he was that exceptionalcreature an aristocrat who really knows what aristocracy means . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aunt Lydia frowned as if searching for the precise word . " He was classic , " she said , " in the purity of his outlines , in the clearness of his thinking . And so he knew that an aristocrat , if he really were to be one , had to box the compass and become a democrat . He was one of the few people , " she added with emphasis , " I 've ever come across who seemed to know instinctively and by trainingwhat losing your soul to save it means . And he was confusing because , after you knew him , you thought there might be some sense to Europe and the caste system after all . He was what Europeand a formal aristocracy might be . " Aunt Lydia interrupted herself . " I trust I am not exaggerating , " she said , " but he had a singularly golden and soothing and trustworthy mind , Vittorio Borghesi . His mind  --  his spirit  --  were like the presence of a Greek statue on a blue Mediterranean day  --  warm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic things are . They 're so much warmer than cold-blooded , self-conscious ornamentation . Vittorio Borghesi , " she concluded , " was what most Italians could be if they were all gentlemen and had common sense . Most of his own class disliked and distrusted him . " " But why did he give my mother up so easily ? " asked Felix . " Why did n't he make her love him ? " Aunt Lydia laughed softly and indulgently and a little sadly . " Because he really loved her , my dear child , and wanted her to be happy , and because he knew that you can not make people love you unless they do love you . Love happens , Felix  --  the sort of love we 're talking about . You can make people respect you , and adore you , and admire you , but you ca n't make them love you , any more than you can make yourself love some one you do n't . That is one thing that is beyond the human will . Your mother , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't love him . " His aunt smiled at Felix , still a trifle sadly . " When you reach my age , " she concluded , " you 'll discover a strange paradox , you 'll realize that the only emotion fit to be called love is just as the Bible describes it  --  it 's almost completely self-forgetful , its only selfishness is the joy it takes in the other person 's happiness . And it regards the other person entirely as an individual . When two people feeling the same way are in love with each other , you have almost perfection . Otherwise , the alternative is merely owning some one else.  |p367Your  mother and father , unless I 'm mistaken , were two people who felt that way . Vittorio Borghesi was wise enough to know that he stood outside ; that , whatever he might feel , he was not the other half of this particular whole . I have told you he was classic . He was far too mature and civilized to imagine that he could outwitnature.Your mother would have stayed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he knew too much . " Aunt Lydia moved her long , slim old hands with a fluttering , restless little gesture . " Very few grow up until it is too late to do anything about it , do they ? I saw Vittorio in Florence in twenty-two . That was the last time . " She was silent for a moment , looking down at her hands . " It is a pity , " she said , without looking up , " that the sort of thing we are talking about  --  the sort of love we mean  --  is so adventitious , is n't it ? So mysterious ; so much like lightning . It strikes often without apparent reason . And so , so much of it is wasted . The two halves of the whole very seldom meet . The ones who are capable of it often waste themselves on nothing . And yet , often , the persons on whom they waste themselves are also capable of great loves , given the chance . " She continued to look down at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Felix . " Oh yes , " said his aunt . " And I 've no doubt he has had the average number of so-called love affairs after the continental fashion . Italians are not fools . " Her voice was a trifle tired ; she was still looking down at her hands . Felix was studying her with grave blue eyes . A faint chill of discovery and surprise had gone up his veins . He perceived that his aunt Lydia had been in love with Vittorio Borghesi but had mentioned it to no one . When Felix went back to 1205 Cassianut Street he took down from the shelves of his grandfather 's library a volume of Epictetusand , thinking of Vittorio Borghesi , read the following passage , Book I , Chapter Four . Felix was very fond of Epictetus . " Where , then , is progress ? If any man among you , withdrawing from external things , has turned his attention to the question of his own moral purpose , cultivating and perfecting it so as to make it fairly harmonious with nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honorable ; and if he has learned that he who craves or shuns the things that are not under his control can be neither faithful nor free , but must himself of necessity be changed and tossed to and fro with them , and must end by subordinating himself to others , those , namely , who are able to procure or prevent these things that he craves or shuns ; and if , finally , when he rises in the morning he proceeds to keep and observeall this that he has learned ; if he bathes as a faithful man , eats as a self-respecting man  --  similarly , whatever the subject matter may be with which he has to deal , putting into practice his guiding principles , as the runner does when he applies the principles of running , and the voice-trainer when he applies the principles of voice-training , this is the man who in all truth is making progress , and the man who has not travelled at random is this one . " Felix raised his head from the volume he was reading and stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father . How strange life was ! From his aunt Lydia , from her friends of the same age whom he met in her house and with some of whom he also fell into the habit of having tea , Felix began to make a further discovery about Philadelphia ; Philadelphia was blessed with a singularly large numberof charming old ladies . Felix could find no explanation for this phenomenon . It could not be the climate ; for the most part the climate was not temperate and therefore not conducive to amicablelongevity . Except in the spring and autumn , the climate of Philadelphia was inclined to extremes ; it was either too hot or too cold . It was a fierce irascible climate . Nor could Felix find in younger Philadelphia females anything that would lead one to predict graceful and philosophic age . To the contrary , although appreciative of their beauty , their high spirits , their almost too pronounced vivacity , and occasional wit , and their excellent average of health , so far Felix had found the majority of these young women forbiddingly anachronistic mentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bland assurance concerning class , surface morals and the rights of wealth that , on the whole , showed no more disposition on their part to think than was ex-P369hibited by their elders . Frequently they shocked Felix in a way which , had he attempted to explain , would have shocked them . Occasionally Felix allowed his mind to dwell gloomily on the thought of how terrible it would be to marry one of these exquisite young creatures . On the other hand , he had already met at least a dozen old ladies whom he would have married in a moment had they been younger . They lived , most of these old ladies , in the heart of the city as did his aunt Lydia . They had lovely houses , large or small  --  as lovely as Felix had ever seen . He imagined that the only houses like them , as his Uncle Felix had said in his letter , were the best houses in London , and in these houses the old ladies lived with quiet dignity . All but three were widows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having seen all they wanted of a man , or men , they had dismissed the question gratefully from their minds ; about the three maiden ladies was an equal calm as if they too might have had illuminating experiences . Several of these old ladies smoked cigarettes daintily in long holders with an innocent pleasure and bravado denied the young who take cigarettes , like automobiles , as a matter of course . And with only one exception , all the old ladies liked their cocktails just as Aunt Lydia did . Felix could not explain their presence or their number , but he felt that they represented something of inherent worth in the city however much it might be overlooked or buried or mishandled . Before he left town for the summer , Felix had two exceedingly interesting experiences . One was an hour spent in a house of prostitution of which , to his great surprise , he found himself the owner ; the other was a visit paid to the two boxlike dwellings in Saxifrage Street . Felix , in the course of his amateur but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Race Street accidentally . It was one of three he owned in that locality ; the other two were occupied by a butcher and a fireman respectively and were not in the same block as " Miss May 's " establishment . " Miss May 's " establishmentwas an eminently respectable place , and Felix found himself , against his better judgment , liking " Miss May . " He had rung the front-door bell and had asked the colored maid , who answered , for the owner  --  a Miss Ramsey according to Goodman and Hart's memorandum  --  and had suddenly found himself in a parlor that struck him as being both Victorian and slightly indecent . He was puzzled by it until Miss Ramsey appeared . The furniture was covered with red plush except for a chromium chair or two , and long lace curtains hung before the windows , but on the mantelpiece were a couple of naked little papier-mache dolls holding feather fans , and all the pictures on the walls , save one of a farm at sunset , were sentimental and unconcerned nudes . Presently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman of thirty-five or so . " Well , dearie , " she said . " And what can I do for you ? " Felix had never been in a house of prostitution before and he thought the atmosphere cosy , at least at that time of the afternoon , but curiously old-fashioned . Accustomed to some extent by now to the candor and Elizabethan rough-and-ready manners of his own class , " Miss May " in comparison seemed conservative and restrained . Felix enjoyed his conversation with her exceedingly ; it was quiet , factual and restfully sentimental as soon as " Miss May " discovered that his visit was based solely on real estate . Up until then it had been for a few moments brisk and businesslike . " Miss May " referred with sorrow to present conditions but with pride to her own resistance to them . " I do n't know what 's come over the world , " she complained . " It 's terrible . Professionals are just out of luck . Imagine a girl giving away something for nothing , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They do n't seem to have no liking for a homey atmosphere any more . I 've always been a mother to my girls . " An honest woman , thought Felix , even a tender-hearted woman in her own way . In fact , not a bad woman at all . Her complaints about conditions and her unwillingness to accept them reminded Felix of several stockbrokers he had met . It must be a curious business , Felix thought , to deal in human flesh , although an old one . He wondered what " Miss May " did when all her girls were upstairs with their patrons . He saw a pile of True Love Stories on a table . Perhaps she read these , rocking slowly in a chair as she was now rocking . Presently a stylishly dressed , brisk and goodlookingyoung woman entered from the street and stuck her head in between the portieres that separated the narrow hall from the parlor.  | " Come in , dearie , " said " Miss May " reassuringly . " This gentlemanand me are having such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have caught a look on the newcomer 's face " . . . strictly social . Or , that is , with just a little business mixed in . He owns this house . Mr. Macalister , this is Miss Naomi . ' " Felix was taken aback . He had always imagined that scarlet women had their profession engraved upon their faces . " Miss Naomi " had the quiet manners and the appearance of a successful stenographer . Times change , he thought . Values were certainly altering . But then there was always the question if they had been real values to begin with . At all events , scarlet women nowadays apparently looked more respectable than their supposedly respectable sisters . And how about the millions and millions of respectable men and women who sold their minds and spirits without a thought that they too were prostitutes ? " Miss May " accompanied Felix to the door . " Well , drop in , " she said cordially , " any time you feel like it . It 's been a real treat seeing you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my young ladies . . . that Naomi 's a nice girl . Every one seems to like her . But  --  " she looked at him shrewdly "  --  I suspect you 've got a girl of your own , have n't you ? Well  --  if she runs out on you . And you need never worry about me , Mr. Macalister . I pay my rent on the dot , and I 've done so all my life . This property at least need never worry you so long as I 'm rentingit . " Felix did not know what to do about " Miss May . " He consultedMr . Wilde , and while he was consulting Mr. Wilde , he described to Mr. Wilde his visit to Saxifrage Street .   " But the former governors that had been before me were chargeableto the people , and had taken of them bread and wine , besides forty shekels of silver . " NEHEMIAH " THE FIRST house , Mr. Wilde , " said Felix , " is occupied by an old lady of seventy , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten , a boy of eight  --  on twelve dollars a week . All night she swabs out office buildings . I think she 's of Scotch descent . She was n't very gracious . She seemed to think her povertywas her own affair . " " Which in a way it is , " suggested Mr. Wilde . He was leaning back in his swivel chair behind his desk , regarding Felix with the interested , slightly indulgent look with which he usually regarded him . " She mellowed a trifle , " continued Felix , " when she understood that I intended to put in a real bathroom , and paint the house , and make all other necessary improvements , and send her grandsonto be cured of rickets , and reduce the rent to the nominal sum of one dollar a month . " " Good Lord ! " murmured Mr. Wilde . " I propose to help her in a dozen other ways too , " said Felix firmly . " But I 'll have to be careful  --  she 's proud . She wo n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're three in the other house . It 's curious ; I 've watched them . They all like to play hop-scotch , and games like that when the sun gets into SaxifrageStreet , which is for an hour or so , but they keep pretty much to themselves . They look like broken-legged crows hopping , " he added meditatively . " Why wo n't Mrs. Ferguson let her grandchildren play with the others ? " asked Mr. Wilde . " She says their mother is a strumpet . " " And is she ? " " Well , not exactly , " said Felix mildly . " She 's not a public  |p373woman  , she merely has a lover , a Mr. Coyle , who 's a bartender in Sansom Street around the corner . I do n't blame her . " " In other words , " said Mr. Wilde , " she 's engaged in what we in higher circles call an affair . ' It 's not unknown . " " That 's it , " agreed Felix , " except that there seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It amounts to the same thing , " said Mr. Wilde . " Mrs. Christman , " said Felix , " is an exceedingly interesting woman . She is n't a bad-looking woman . I spent an hour or so with her . She was polite but secretive . I did n't feel as unwelcome with her as with Mrs. Ferguson , although I 'm going to renovate her house too . But she has money . Mr. Coyle gives her some and her husband is a veteran of the last war . She said he had a pension . She 's about thirty-five with a pale face and black eyes and black hair parted in the middle . Her fingernails are dirty and blood red . " " Oh , " said Mr. Wilde , " so she has a husband ? Where does he live ? " " Right there , " said Felix . His face wrinkled as if he were recalling an astonishing memory . " Right there ? " said Wilde . " Yes , right there . When I went in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room  --  there 's only that and the kitchen on the first floor , and the shutters were half closed  --  was a tall gaunt man in a wheel chair . Nothing moved but his eyes . " Felix swallowed . " That was Mr. Christman , and the odd thing was that I think he was one of the boys who years ago used to catch me and beat me . It was quite a shock seeing him sitting there . He 's totally paralyzed . " Mr. Wilde looked at Felix with a steady , lingering look . " And what you mean , " he suggested , " is that Christman sits there totally paralyzed , with only his eyes moving , and watches Coyle come in and out of his house . . . . Hum ! That 's quite a situation , is n't it ? I think Mrs. Ferguson is right . " " No , " said Felix decidedly , " she is n't . There 's more to it than that  --  there almost always is . Mrs. Christman is n't a strumpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her children could have better air and living conditions , and she said Saxifrage Street was the only home her husband had ever known , and to move him would kill him . I did n't ask her , of course , about divorce , but in the course of our conversation , she mentioned that she was all her husband had and that he would n't let any one else look after him . No , there was more to it than appeared on the surface . Mrs. Christman was tender about her husband . I listened to her voice , and she 's a hard woman naturally , but she 's tender to her husband . Faithful to him in her own way . She 's young , however , and so I imagine likes a little gayety every now and then  --  dancing and the theatre and clothes  --  and she wants a whole man , naturally . But she keeps the house together , and I think she pays for whateverluxuries her husband has . After all , his pension would n't go very far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an epithet , Mr. Wilde . But I think her two youngest children must be Coyle 's . " Felix was silent for a moment . " I wish , though , " he concluded , " she 'd keep her fingernails clean . " Mr. Wilde nodded his head . " Yes , " he said , " that 's very important , but nowadays a good many young women think that all they have to do is to paint them . " Felix was staring over Mr. Wilde 's head at the big window with its panorama of the city . " Mr. Wilde , " he said , " the most confusing thing in the world is the especial virtues of every one and the especial vices . It makes judgment difficult , does n't it ? There 's Mrs. Christman and her husband , and Mrs. Ferguson , and then my friend , Miss Ramsey  --  ' Miss May . ' What are you going to do about it ? Mrs. Ferguson is as virtuous and honest an old lady as you can find , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue at all and no bodily faithfulness , but eminent spiritual faithfulness . And Miss May ' "  --  Felix grinned deprecatingly  --  " is what people call a whore , but she 's a whole lot nicer than any number of respectable women I know who spend their time murdering other people 's characters . What are you going to do about it ? " Mr. Wilde was regarding Felix somberly . " I do n't know , " he said . " I 've often wondered . " He narrowed his eyes . " I may add , that I 've wondered about myself as much as any one . I guess the greatest virtue , perhaps , is to withhold judgment until judgment is absolutely necessary . The human tongue is the most terrible guillotine known , and human judgmentp375is the most fallible of instruments . It would be nice , and amazing , would n't it , to meet a whole person ? " He hesitated . " And yet I do n't know . He , or she , might seem monstrous . Are you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in Close Harbor in July ? " " I think so , " said Felix . " I 've had a couple of invitations to stay in the country , but I 'm comfortable in my own house , and my book 's going fast . No  --  I do n't think I 'll move . " Mr. Wilde leaned forward , his arms on his desk . He pushed aside a small vase containing four magnificent white carnations . " Chabaud 's Giant Double , " he commented . " They 're fine blooms . And what do you propose to do about Miss May , ' and Mrs. Christman , and the others ? " " Nothing , " said Felix . " That is , so far as they are concerned . I 've wrestled with the question . Miss May 's ' the result of a system . So long as human flesh is cheap , you 're going to have prostitutionand you 're going to have war . When the human race regards itself as highly as it does a Swiss watch or a Rolls-Royce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't stamp on Swiss watches . If I moved Miss May ' out , she 'd only go somewhere else . This idea of attacking prostitution , or war , from the wrong end , Mr. Wilde , is unscientific . It 's like the so-called labor problem . The heart of the labor problem is that too many people still think labor 's a commodity . So long as you think human beings are commodities , you 'll have a labor problem , and you 'll have war , and you 'll have prostitution . " Felix wrinkled his nose . " After all , the manufacturing of babies is about the simplest process known . You need little equipment . If you have too many babies , and continue to regard humanity as a commodity , then you 'll glut the market and humanity will be cheap . You 've read Lao-Tzu , have n't you ? Well , you remember where he says , Govern a great nation as you would cook a little fish ' ? I 'd paraphrase that into , produce babies and educate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Felix grinned . " No , I 'm going to leave Miss May ' alone and every now and then when I 'm bored with the pretensions of my own class I 'm going up to call on her . " He interrupted himself hastily . " But in a purely social manner , " he added . The lizards darted in and out of Mr. Wilde 's eyes . " Granted , " he said . " But in addition , as I understand it , you are going to take the fifty or so of your worst houses , **30;8100;TOOLONG Scotsman , his name was Thomas Stevenson .

" I 'm so intrigued by those lines on the chart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone every day . " " I 'd be mair cheery if they were a little longer . There 's a big coal consumption . " " Dear me , that 's something I never thought of , I must leave room for that . " Mrs. Bannister made a note . " But I mean , the lines look so straight on the map , do you know beforehand you 're going in the right direction or do you make a little turn every now and then ? " " It 's just a form of fantasy , " he said dourly . " Yell maybe have noticed the watter is no actually flat . Anyhow that 's not my department , I 'll be keeping my mind on gauges and bunkers . " " If you found you did n't have enough coal , I suppose you 'd have to go faster ? Well , I fear I must leave you good people .

And we 're talking about speed of engines , not speed of vessel . Dinna forget percentage of slip . "  | " What would that be , in weather like this ? " asked Miss Bristol . " I 'll hide nothing from a scientist , " said Mr. Murk . " More than ten per cent . " " I 'll buy you a grog , " said Dr. Chrisdie to Mr. Murk after the others had also gone below . The chief had given Miss Bristol a hand as far as the door . " Yon 's a lassie wi ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would call congenital magnetism.  --  Come awa ' to the smokeroom . There 's just time before old Triton blows his wreathed horn . " Geoffrey noticed when it was put before him that the eggshellhad a pale lilac tinge . " It looks like an Easter egg , " he said .

Mr. McScoon , ' e 's very deliberate about ' is heggs . If there 's any question at all they goes right aft to the steerage . " " It looks jubious to me , " said Aunt Kilda . " Oh no indeed , Miss , you do n't need to ' ave no ' orrors , this ' ere 's a pedigree hegg . " Boxer , in pendulum stance with the swing of the ship , smartly sliced the shell . At once all adjoining chairs spun outward and the party fled from the table . Even Geoffrey , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eddy of gas . " Fishwives , it 's a foetus , " said Aunt Kilda . " McScoon was certainly too deliberate with that one , " said Uncle Dan . Boxer for one of the few times in his service was stopped at the source . Hastily he smothered the offense with a napkin and started for the door . It was an upgrade at that moment , he had to pause for support at one of the stanchions so the other tablep102got a whiff too , but Boxer 's discomfiture proved a social solvent . Passengers hitherto aloof came over to occupy the vacant chairs beside Geoffrey and Uncle Dan and rival anecdotes were told . Dr. Friedeck said it reminded him of Paris after the siege , and gave the details ( delightful to Geoffrey ) of a memorable fricasseeof rats . Geoffrey was so much interested that the little German quite warmed to him . " We had a saying when I was a child , Nast du Eier gerne frisch , Setz das Huhn gleich auf den Tisch . " He was surprised that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delighting in mere sound . " You have an ear for speech , " he said , " very unusual among the English . " " What does it mean ? " Geoffrey asked . " To have fresh eggs you 'll not be able , unless the hen lays on the table , " suggested Uncle Dan . Mr. McScoon came in to make apologies . Even Boxer was a little subdued ; the best he could say was it must have been one of a shipment intended for the Cunard . " Let us change the topic , " said Dr. Friedeck . " Speaking of words , here 's an English paradox : if for a ship it 's meant , you call it cargo ; if in a car it goes , you call it shipment . What can science do with such anomalies ? " " I like the way you talk , " said Geoffrey . " Tell me some more . " When the group gathered a little later for Jude the Obscure they were amused to find Dr. Friedeck and Geoffrey sitting together at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the professor was humming the student songs of his youth . Geoff had never known that words could sound so comically and deliciouslydifferent . " We 'll make a philologian out of this child , " said the professor . " He has instinctive Sprachgefuehl  --  do n't worry about the meanings , just enjoy the sound . " " Do the one with a bugle in it ! "  | " Again ? Gott , wie er freut Bich , " said Dr. Friedeck . " He makes a good audience . " In an undertone of luscious sentiment he warbled : " Morgenrot , morgenrot , Leuchtest mir zum fruehen Tod . Bald wird die Trompeten blasen. . . . " and followed by an imitation of a trumpet call . " It does n't sound like the lunch bugle , it sounds sad , " said Geoff . " English does n't do it justice . English is imperfect for its own sentiments . How could it be adequate to ours ? " " Oh morning red , oh morning red , Tomorrow morning I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do it justice , " repeated Dr. Friedeck , angrily 2 5 . Mid-oceanThe weather softened , people not seen before appeared on deck , including the DuQuesnes , Mr. and Mrs. Marple and their scion Master Chester Marple . The latter seemed to Uncle Dan an unattractive child , pallid and oppressed by nasal obstructions , but he was just enough older to arouse admiration in Geoffrey . Chester 's exaggerated deference in public gave Uncle Dan a suspicion that he was at mischief around corners , but when he tracked the boys he usually found them gaping at the yacht model displayed outside the saloon . The sheltered side of the promenade was now well filled , and the readings of Jude were slowed down by miscellaneous conversation . Dan felt a little self-conscious about the reading since Aunt Bee had joined them . Even when she seemed asleep she was often alert to more than one might suppose . Mr. Snead , one of the poker players , was particularly awed by the conversation of their learned group , which he called The Faculty . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweed cap . " I guess the future of American education is O.K. , " he would say ; or " I would n't understand , I 'm just a lowbrow . " Uncle Dan was tickled by this coinage . " Wonderful ! " he exclaimed . " A perfect example of instinctivegenius for wordmaking . Good Elizabethan too : there 's something in The Tempest about foreheads villainous low . ' " Mr. Snead winked to Mr. Marple and drew him away to the smoke-room . More difficult was Mrs. Lotus Bannister who sat simmering with enthusiasm on the edge of the party . She had little control and vented sugary or irrelevant ejaculations . Dr. DuQuesne was telling them how much Shakespeare had cribbed from Montaignewhen Mrs. Bannister burst in with " Do you think Dreyfuswas really guilty ? " Friedeck and Miss Shaugraun were at it hammer and tongs about Gildersleeve versus Von **26;8132;TOOLONG Mrs. Bannister asked , " Would you spell that wonderful name for me , Professor , so I can write it down ? " Dr. Friedeck excused himself and brusquely pulled his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to myself this is really my college education , " Lotus confided , after several struggles with the German name . " It was so good of Mr. Bannister to let me come , poor him , he gets so unsociable when he 's left alone , but I 'd always set my heart on my literary pilgrimage . You do n't know what England does to an American , so much history and intellect , it hardly seems fair in such a small island , it just shows that size is n't everything . I was thinking when I was up in that darling Lake Country , really quite small ponds and yet all that marvelous poetry , now look at our Great Lakes , why should n't we have some Great Lake Poets ? Of course there 's Chautauqua  --  " There was silence for a while . " I remember a cryptic remark of Gildersleeve 's , " said Miss Shaugraun , " how he spent an Atlantic voyage reading Pindar in the smoke-room . That 's where you men have such an ad-vantage. "  | " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student ever had , " Dan said . " He was talking about the use of the summer vacation ; he said take away with you a clean copy of the text you 're working on , so your previous notes do n't interfere with freshness of vision . " The memory of this wise advice gave him a sharp need for movement and silence . Aft of the midship deckhouse a long narrow gangway spanned the orlop and led to the fenced platform of the poop . This passageway had been barred during the gale ; the plunge of the sloping stern was terror and vertigo for the landsman . But now in the soft curve of afternoon Dan found the gate unfastened . White iron gates usually lead into gardens , he thought , rememberingone between the Meadow and The Wilderness . This was very different , but in the acceptance of the hour he blamed nothing for being itself . Perhaps with falling wind and gentling sea the mind was slackened too . For the first time since QueenstownHarbor conscious attention did not have to apply itself to mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer hostile , only a surly habit . The imaginative barber , taking his off hour on the hatch below , shouted up a friendly hail . " We y n't gettin ' kicked abaht so , more like swingin ' a babby in yer arms . " Crumbling blue profiles spread in acres of snow , but now it seemed melting snow in a softening thaw . Yes , like February afternoons under the old garden wall in the beginning of Dan 's world ; the crocus time . He envied his shipmates who seemed all at once to have disappeared into siesta . The weather had relaxed and they with it , subconsciously assured that the storm had not intended anything personal . Even Geoffreyand Chester had been lured by the deck steward into a diversion of quoits . Uncle Dan knew this was going well for he had seen one of the rope rings tossed wildly overboard and spinning in the green riot below him . His emotions were always tardy . Why did he seem only nowp106saying his real good-by , reviewing with wretched clearness the innocent and stoic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor attitudes of parting ? Residual magnetism , I suppose , he thought . Mr. Murk had interested him by expounding three different kinds of polarity that bedevil the compass at sea . There was the ship 's own congenital magnetism born into her in the builder 's yard ; and the induced or momentary magnetismof the course being steered ; and the retained or residual polarity that lingered in the binnacle as a result of any protractedvoyage . " It 's no deeferent frae a boozer 's hangover , " said Mr. Murk . " I 'm tellin ' ye when we turrn the Delaware Capes and steer norrard we 'll have to set a course twelve degreeseastward of actual for compensation . Yell no can run east and west like this wi'out giein ' the needle a wryneck . The magneticpole is an unco pheenomenon . There was a vessel I traveledin once , her compass was so flighty we maun put in a Flinders Bar six feet lang . It cam doun into the second mate 's bunk and he sleepit wi ' a shaft o ' cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like all they second mates , and he tried to imagine it was companionship . The Iron Maiden he ca 'd her , but she was no verra comforting shape . " It was news to Dan that the compass was so temperamental . Like any organism of keen and subtle temper it had loyalties or memories of its own . He remembered having felt secretly disturbed when he acquired his citizenship in the United States . He had to " renounce allegiance " to any previous affiliation ; yet there are allegiances or residual magnetisms which words do not annul . So there was consolation in Mr. Murk 's jocularity about the grievances of the wheelhouse . No one need be reproached for mixing latitudes and longitudesin the hypnotic lull of sea-solitude . He tried to visualize them , lines of geometry stretched like lace over the arched breast of the world . The run of the waves lifted them against clear distance , through pale scallops of hollowed foam he could see them , string-taut on the imagined perfect sphere . He chosep107one far ahead , marked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over it and the flailing screw tore it apart . Solitude is never embarrassed and he mumbled to himself phrases that seemed of great wisdom . Mid-ocean , he said , mid-ocean ! This must be just about it . But each phantom meridian  --  he could see them exquisitely black as hair strokes of India ink  --  drew his mind forward to sketch and covet a new one . His eyes were tired of switching to and fro . I must choose one and stick to it . There it is in that long purple valley . Mid-ocean . Worse than that , the fortieth meridian , maybe . Unpleasing coincidence , for he knew from Geoffrey how secret the fortieth-birthday cake was being kept . Even the word mid-ocean was a quotation from Geoffrey . " I 'm monstrous full of fleas , this is mid-ocean , Boxer says so . He says we 'll have Mother Carey 's chickens for dinner . " Association with children makes an artist of the most literal . Even in a few days aboard ship Dan had drawn more pictures , invented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself was poet more than in a decade of teaching literature . Horrible , he exclaimed , and hammered the vibrant rail . Here he was nauseated by the sickness of the skull  --  infinitely worse than any sickness of the sea  --  the mystery of transition and impermanence , while a child , the monkey of the moment , nimble and insensible , is at home everywhere , even when surrounded by visible infinity . Mid-ocean : it would look well at the heading of a letter , what I 'm really doing now is writing to Harry , good old Harry , a letter that will never be put on paper . Harry was the only person with whom he had ever been able to communicate . The heroic figures of his mother and sisters were like seated marbles ; one lowered one 's voice , spoke with the anguish of love or homage , but it was unreal . Had the stony reticence of so many generations broken down in himself ?

I suppose you imagine a teacher leads a gay impulsive life of scholarly conjecture ; the fact is he 's frightened , has n't guts enough to tackle people his own size and wants to get back to the safety of classroom and curriculum . No , that is n't quite fair but I 'm not really writing to Harry so I can say what I feel . I had a funny twinge of envy when I saw Chrisdie asleep with Lecky in his deck chair .

I guess that 's what we teachers are , just dead woodpeckers . He looks rather like one too , I mean Chrisdie , he 's got the most comical long nose and he 's going bald very young ( most middle-westerners do , I do n't know why , but even the country out there has n't much foliage ) but I like him better as I get used to him .

You could see him racked with resolution as he sat down with us , saying to himself , " I must be more playful . " But imagine that temperament dealing with Swift or Pope ! I guess one of the things that happens top109the English mind as it moves westward is , it gets more solemn . But you 'll see when you come over ( I 'm still talking to you , Harry ) something does happen . It always seemed to me very odd , on the coasts of the British Isles you see the ocean rolling in  --  then you go three thousand miles and you see it rolling quite obviously and regularly the other way . But nobody notices where is the dividing line , like a parting in one 's hair . Certainlythere 's a division of some sort , where the combers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just crossed . Dan heard a clang as the gate was opened and closed at the other end of the footway . He was surprised to see a figure with brightened color and whipping skirts leaning her way across . It was Miss Bristol . Still a bit dazed with his rocking solitude he gaped at the surprising picture . Centered on the long swing of the ship in such a panorama of movement and color the small figure clung to the rail with one hand . Two were needed , but her red knitted cap was about to blow off . Even in the moment of hesitation before he realized she needed help , Dan decided that the jersey cap was woven of the same fabric as the fluttering petticoat and wondered if this was economy or art . He hastened forward and grabbed her elbow . " You should n't come out here . " " I wo n't again until I have four hands , " she said , trying to manage cap , skirt and railing simultaneously .

" " I 've got news for you , that 's why I came . "  |p110Dan  had never supposed a woman disheveled could look so pretty . He could n't really hear what she was saying but he helped her back to the lee of the deckhouse . She shouted in his ear , which had not been so closely approached since it was scoured in youth . " I hated to bother you , " she said , " but I am afraid you 'll have to do something about Dr. Friedeck . He was asleep in his chair and Geoffrey and that nasty little Chester tied him with a skipping-rope . They said he was General Custer tortured by Indians . It must have been Chester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thought he was drowning and struggled to escape . His chair fell over , he hit his eye and he 's very angry . He says it 's an outrage after he 's been so kind to Geoffrey , and he must have an apology . " I always imagined , wrote Dr. Chrisdie , that aboard ship one would have leisure to settle down and think , but honest to God , this 10 P.M. supper when they put watery cocoa and pilot crackerson the saloon table and you help yourself is the only chance one gets . All day long we get shaken together like liniment in a bottle . There would n't be room here to put down a fraction of what goes on . It never struck me before what a small portionof actual events historians can describe . ( N.B. That would make a good start for my talk at the seminar on Historical Method ? ) Most absurd thing I ever witnessed , I was having a lovely nap , I guess everybody was . We were stretched out in our chairs , Miss Shaugraun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. Friedeck had pulled his chair out of the way behind the ventilator . I thought I heard the kids whispering . It seems they took a piece of rope and tied Friedeck into his chair while he was asleep . He must have had a nightmare or something , everybody has a theory about it . Dr. DuQuesnep111thinks Dr. F. was tied up and frightened by a French firing squad in 187o , anyhow when he woke he made a fearful jump , the chair went over and he cracked his eye on a big iron ringbolton the deck . There was hell to pay . He said that everybody had been insulting him for days and he must have " satisfaction . " Shaugraun said , " What does he want to do , fight a duel with the two children ? Tell him I 'll meet him with one of McScoon 's eggs at ten paces . " What made it worse , in his tumble his china teeth got dislodged , he could n't speak until he rearranged them and the two kids were yelling with laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we bandaged his eye right away with a towel and cold salt water , of which there 's plenty . I figure the stunt was young Chester 's idea because he hastened to make himself scarce . Geoffrey stood by , I 'll say that for him , but his comments were n't exactly tactful . When Barton got there Dr. Friedeck stood up very stiff and said he wanted a formal apology . He put it in such a nasty way no one knew what to do . We all stood around trying to pacify him and a weird windy echo kept coming from nowhere , " Oh , please apologize ! " Friedeck got madder still , I guess he thought it was somebody kidding . It was poor little Miss Barton down in her cabin . She heard the fuss through the ventilator , it acts like a magnified speaking tube , she kept calling plaintively up the pipe but the ferocious little man was terribly sore . The ship 's doctor came up from the steerage where he 's been busy most of the voyage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't give him a written apology , " he said , " it 's too ridiculous . I dare say Geoffreyought to be put in the brig on bread and water but after all it was only a child 's prank . " " I do n't see how those franc-tireurs could have missed him , " said Dr. DuQuesne , " that would have solved everything . " The stiff little man was really very childish himself , standing with one hand on his eye , the other holding the ventilator handle , waiting for someone to satisfy his pride . " He 's so excessivelyPrussian , " whispered Miss Shaugraun , or she thought itp112was a whisper . Everything looked very bad , for how could Bartonand I get along with a cabin-mate in this mood , and tomorrowis the get-together of the Ship 's Concert , to say nothing of Barton 's secret birthday cake ? The rest of the afternoon everyone was in dismay but I suppose the deck steward must have told Captain Bompjes about it . Wonderful man , I never realized how smart a captain has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform , anyway he sent the first officer to see Dr. Friedeck where he was sulking in the cabin , with a written apologyon behalf of the ship herself . Captain Bompjes explained ( what I 'm sure he just made up ) that there had been a terrible billow , a sort of tidal wave , extraordinary and unexpected , which must have upset the chair , so it was the fault of the ship and she humbly asked his pardon  --  signed by the Captain himselfand with Barton and me as witnesses . He had the first officeradd verbally that the barber was very skillful in painting shiners and would Dr. Friedeck accept a treatment with the compliments of the company ? I wish I could have seen the patient receiving this document but Barton and I thought it well not to visit our cabin until he had been mollified . The officer described him sitting up in his bunk with a slice of fresh beef  --  well anyway , beef  --  over his eye . He made a dignified little speech and put the paper in his wallet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard . Uncle Dan found them in the library alcove . Under instructionfrom the President of Geoffland , Aunt Blanche was drawing a map of that country ; Aunt Kilda was knitting and enjoying the boy 's communicative mood . " Geoffland is a long narrow country , " its ruler explained . " There 's a street that runs right through the middle , that 's the Thorofare . Up at this end is a big part that 's very jolly , it'sp113for the sociable people , it 's called Saloon . There 's a through train on the P.R.R. goes all the way to Seckford City . It drops a slip carriage at Boxerville . " " I can see that Geoffland is a great resource , " Kilda said to Dan . " It reflects whatever the President is thinking about at the time . " " I was amused the other day , " Dan whispered . " It was confidedto me that some of the ladies in Geoffland were allowed to cut their hair short . " " Seckford , that 's the capital of County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shawls and dance outdoors when it is n't infectious . Now we can color the different places . " " Such a lot of counties , I do n't believe there are enough crayons left , " said Uncle Dan . " The best colors seem to have disappeared . It 's a way they have . " " How many have you got ? " asked Aunt Blanche . Uncle Dan looked through the Emergency Bag . " Only four , rather tame . Yellow , brown , pink , and a sort of gray . " " That 's plenty . You can color any map , no matter how many subdivisions it has , with only four colors . " " What , without having the same colors touch along the boundaries ? Surely not ! Think of the United States , forty-four of them  --  no , forty-five , they brought in another since I became a citizen  --  you 'd certainly need more colors than that to mark off all the boundaries . " " I do n't care if it was Germany in the Middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four colors without any two contiguous divisions using the same tint . It 's a famous curiosity in geometry . It makes atlas printing commercially possible . " " I thought I knew something about maps , " said Dan . " Can you prove it ? " " I do n't think it can be formulated , it 's just so . Take the crayons and try it . " " While you do the colors I 'll be the train to Boxerville , " said Geoff and choo-chooed off . Dan experimented with the crayons.  | " I guess you 're right , " he admitted . " I 'll never need to buy so many different colors after this . I had no idea geometry penetratedeven into Geoffland . " " Wait until she tells you about spiders , " said Kilda . " I always disliked them , nasty things , but when I learned they spin by logarithms they horrify me , cold-blooded , ha-haugh ! " " I never met mathematics socially before , " said Dan . " Speakingof that , if I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tonight I 've got to be chairman at the Concert , and now the Captain asks me to read the lessons or something at the church service tomorrow . He says we 'll be on soundings , he ca n't leave the bridge , too busy with the blue pigeon . " " That sounds very High-Church , " said Kilda . " It 's what they call the sounding lead .  --  I tried to beg off , the Church of England ritual is quite out of character for a Quaker , but there are n't any parsons on board . It seems to disprove the old superstition that you only get bad weather when there 's a clergyman in the ship . " " Quite a change from Jude the Obscene . I shall look forward to the service for the first time in years . " " Very kind of you , I 'm sure , but here 's the point : nobody , not even Mrs. Bannister , seems to know which particular Sundayit is . I mean , how many Sundays after Trinity , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Why not ask Mr. Murk ? He knows everything . Trinity is eight Sundays after Easter ; somebody must know when Easter was ? " " I 'm afraid she 's a godless ship , " said Dan . " Neither Mr. Murk nor Mr. Huskisson remember the date of Easter because they were ashore that week . " " Perhaps I could work it out for you , " said Blanche . " There 's a formula for finding Easter , invented by Gauss . Have you a pencil ? I 'll show you . " Aunt Bee came into the saloon and sat down beside them . " What on earth are you doing ? " she asked  | " We 're trying to compute the date of Easter , but I have n't got room for the figures . " " Last Easter ? It was April tenth . I remember perfectly becauseLizzie Batts went to Framlingham . " " Splendid , " said Dan . " How much more useful is the simple domestic mind than all the sophisticated sciolism of science . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working it out , just for discipline . " " No thank you . Things are difficult enough without that . Now we know when Easter was , we can find the right place . Hand me the prayer book , please  --  I want to read over the collectsand things beforehand . " " A man of letters should be more familiar with the book of common prayer , " said Kilda severely . " If you look at the back of the book , you 'll find a special section for use at sea . There 's that wonderful psalm for thanksgiving after a storm . " " Yes , but there 's a verse there that Bee wo n't like , their soul abhorred all manner of meat . ' We 'll take the other one , about turning the sea into dry land . " " You 're always so squeamish about what you think will startle other people , " Bee said . " I overheard you all talking together about the terrible things in Jude the Obscure . You were so dreadfully shocked and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't anything in the story that I have n't seen right at home in Wilford . You should ask Allie if you want to know the seamy side of a country town . It 's a good thing you never heard the family history of the Ghostly Demon . " Dan looked at his sister in amazement . She had taken out her knitting and was reckoning stitches . " When Dan went away to college , " she said to the others , " we all made up our minds to conceal from him anything that would distract him from his literature . Students have to lead such a sheltered life . " Blanche was amused to notice a dim flush of annoyance creepingunder Dan 's beard . Bee must have noticed it too for she saidp118Dan began to feel victimized . Evidently the evening was going to rest heavily on him , he had a silly twinge of envy for the seaman in oilskins retiring to the simplicity of the focsle . But if the social responsibility was to be his , the first thing to do was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been busy . It was undignified to hold an uncle responsible for the errors of a nephew . Also he had a genuine respect for Professor Barton who had at any rate struggled to escape his provincial origin and in spite of imperfectscholarship was plainly a person of sensibility . After all , was not that the extraordinary thing about the British race , under their haphazard manners and their complacent Inselbeschrinktheit , they have imagination . A Prussian scholar need not fear to admit the truth , and the astonishing truth is ( he thought , laying out his dinner clothes ) that those fantastic people , undisciplined and boorish , are poets ; even the undrilled and impromptu character of their verse has its bucolic charm . A GermanGelehrter would not fall into the absurdity of Voltaire who could not esteem the English genius because it disobeyed all rules . It would be pleasant to say something of this sort to his roommate Barton . With just the correct rigor to suggest that though one knows there has been offense one is gracious enough to overlook it . Standing erect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practiced a small authoritative bend of reconciliation . At that moment the foghorn blasted his tight nerves and the studs flew in all directions . Much sharper angles of flex were required in search . He prostrated under the berths , but still two buttons were unfound . His ardent blood stream was intolerant of such postures , the arteries of ears and neck drummed pressure , and the newly enameled eye rubbed brusquely on the edge of the washstand . He rang for Stretch , but the steward was busy elsewhere . He was making a last furiousgrope behind a trunk when Dan tapped gently at the door.  |p119Grunting  disgust he drew his legs out of the way and shouted through the opening , " Damnation , blue fire , why did n't you come sooner ? " By the time Stretch arrived , the situation was beyond repair . Dr. Friedeck had locked the door shouting , " I do n't care how many people want to dress , there 's only room for one . Who do you think you are , Cecil Rhodes ? " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Dan came downstairs . But Uncle Dan 's mind was on other concerns , he shook his head vaguely and replied , " I did n't say anything . That was the foghorn . " Geoff thought he knew the Word , he had overheard Uncle Dan use it several times in conversation on deck ; and in so special a tone that it sounded important . But he wanted to be more sure before saying it aloud himself . A strange word , magicalperhaps ; laughable-sounding yet always uttered by Uncle Dan with a tinge of gravity . The first blast of the foghorn had sounded a little like it , beginning with a hiss , then lung-deep from within . He stood in the passage holding the handrail , happy and absorbed . He was admiring his miscellaneous panoramaof America . Perhaps it was something like Geoffland , with a prairie , an endless Sutton Heath where Indians chased the buffalo  --  or vice versa . Or a very small U.S.S. Mane bursting in flame and fragments ; or the vast , cloudy , benignant outline of Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meadows and the gals . It was that hour of late afternoon when the sea had leveled to a broad greasy swell and all had retired to their quarters to make ready for the Captain 's Dinner and the Concert . The saloon doors were closed while Mr. McScoon and his stewards dressed the tables , and there was emptiness in the lobby . Perhaps Geoffrey could even feel it as a threatening or impending empti/ness : the dangerous world of larger people had mysteriously retractedits forces in preparation for some new absurdity . Nothing is more queer than the exact record of what people were doing at any moment of crisis . Mrs. Bootle , for instance . When the fog shut down she was rushing from Bootle Junction to the aid of Mrs. Bannister . That lady , preparing herself with art to inflict her Selections at the Concert , was carefully balanced before a quite incommensurate mirror . But a given bulk which has trained itself to a certain latitude of swing is sure to overcompensatewhen the roll does not go so far . Accordingly as the obedient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned too wide . She fell heavily upon her settee and burst a number of necessary fraps . She bore down on the stewardess 's bell with a well-padded thumb , and in that instant heard the ship make speech for the first time . Mr. Huskisson in his cabin wrestling into his mess jacket , was in no danger of falling ; his room was so narrow he could wedge his feet from side to side . He was calculating how many guests he should invite to take a glass of sherry as a warm-up for the celebration . He had instructed McScoon to serve wine and hors d'oeuvres in the engineers ' mess-room as he felt the evening was going to need stimulus . Every purser has a small allowance from the company for necessary strokes of tact , but the allowanceis moderate and obviously had better not include the smoke-room quartet . Mr. Murk always resented the use of his officers ' mess for such receptions , it necessitated the removal of certain Parisian lithographs cherished by the junior engineers , but there was no other space for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy in the purser 's mind when he heard the opening blast . As usual , he thought , the Captain wo n't come down for the Captain 's Dinner , and murmured to himself his commander 's habitual epigram about the Grand Banks : " Dirty per cent dirty weather . " Boxer , having finished Dr. Friedeck 's eye , was due for servicep121in decorating the saloon . It had been a difficult session because the parrot , who always knew when anything unusual was toward , was very talkative . Dr. Friedeck , morbidly alert for personalreference , had been offended by her innocent repetition , " Dirty old man . Lost my drawers , lend me yours . " Boxer wondered if he ought to cover the cage but felt it was not quite fair to do so on Marie 's evening of riot . Trouble is , he meditated , she and the Prof got such different senses of ' umor . If any . As barbers and gods may do , looking down from above , he was curious to consider what kind of peculiar traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got a ' igh pressure temperament , not ' arf , he thought as he saw occasional flushes of circulation redden and fade on the customer 's skull . A sprinkle of witch ' azel for ' is ' ot box , he thought in philosophic detachment , and did n't even charge for it . He was startled when Dr. Friedeck , instead of buying only one ticket for the raffle , took a dozen , which even at a low percentage yielded more than the tip Boxer had faintly hoped . He often knew what Marie was going to say before she said it , and he saw her beak already open for her special blasphemy when the foghorn roared . The parrot drew in every quill and shuffled to the far corner of the cage . Loyally he apologized for her . " Gor , she do n't relish a fog . " " I think I shall wear my fascinator , " Blanche was saying , " it gets so draughty in the saloon . " " Also it 's very becoming , " said Kilda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm glad to see the Square Root of Minus One perking up a bit . " " Barton , poor fellow , takes this evening very seriously . " Blanche did not admit that Dan had confided to her that afternoon the gist of the terse and witty little speech he hoped to make . They had met accidentally at the after end of the promenade , and in the lee of the ventilator he told her how really significant the Concert might be made . But he was ratherp122distracted by the small curly head and knitted cap so becomingly framed in the circle of the ventilator rim . " I would n't make too many international comparisons , " Blanche suggested . " I dare say you 're right . " " Your sister is a very wise creature , " said Blanche . " We were speaking of Professor Friedeck and she said , Poor man , he 's terribly unhappy . ' I said , He does n't look it , the way he struts about . " Oh yes he is , ' said Miss Barton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that stubborn morbid sensitiveness need all sorts of help . Anything stiff breaks so easily . ' " " Perhaps I 'd better go back to the stern and think over my speech again , " said Dan humbly . This dialogue was repeating itself in Blanche 's mind as she excavated the fascinator and her evening gown from the trunk . She had not expected they would be worn during the voyage . If I had known , she thought , I would have used more tissue paper . At that moment came the foghorn . The vibration shook apart one of Kilda 's smoke rings . " Fishwives ! How 's that for an appetizer ? " She clambered to her knees to look out of the port . " Real Newfoundland fog , " she said . " Maybe some of the fishwives wo n't be getting their fish . " " Oh , poor Mr. Barton , " said Blanche . " Will that be going on all through his speech ? " Geoffrey , coming back to the lobby , found it still empty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelty for his enjoyment , had evidently frightened everyone out of sight . He was alone with the model yacht . There were several things about it he would like to discuss with Uncle Dan but there had always been someone in the way  --  often the domineering Chester . The two boys had coveted it together , and Geoffrey described sailing on Wilford River , but Chester was contemptuous . Who ever heard of sailing on a river , he said . Sailing was done on lakes . Geoffrey felt differentp123about Chester since the accident with Dr. Friedeck . Chester had first crossed his heart and hoped to die that he only participated in the trick to please Geoffrey , and then instead of saying he was sorry he shammed sick . There were things about the model yacht that Geoff would not care to express to anyone like Chester . It was a little ship inside a big ship , and that seemed to mean something . He did not know exactly what happened at a raffle , but he felt that the yacht was almost his already . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was more wonderful than anything in Miss Hoo 's window , more perfect than Harry Bredfield 's Scandal . No smell in the cabin , no mildew on her snowy sails , he could feel her trembling alive where tide and air were equal partners . Even her name , who knows what music it meant to the focsle artificer : those exquisite letters in green , ELLEN ARKINS . The varnish of her three-foot deck , the cockpit with a little brass wheel , the coil of mimic halliards , tiny reef-points , sweet groining of her stern  --  how exquisite a retreat into the understandable from surrounding bedlams of space . Where everything jostled she was fixed , where everything rioted she was steady , where everything was huge she was minute . He wanted to say to Uncle Dan : If I were small enough I could sail her . The retrussing of Mrs. Bannister made Mrs. Bootle a little late in her own private schedule . A well-trained ship 's company leaps to automatic alert when the foghorn blows ; they know that melancholy cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is inadvisable to let them brood . The stewardesshastened to the staterooms of the other ladies under her charge , either to offer assistance in equipment or to urge dinner dress upon any who seemed languid . Fog and the curdling drone of the whistle break down even professional reticences . When she met Stretch in the bathroom passage she rebuked him forp124not goading his gentlemen into boiled shirts . " If it 's fog , " she said , " I always gets ladies into a decoltay . It keeps up their pecker , and if there 's going to be wallering in cold water they might as well look their best . " " A wonderful comfort you are , old nannie . ' Ow long does yer think a dress shirt will ' old starch inside a life-preserver ? " Mr. Huskisson 's guests were comfortably seated in the engineers ' mess . They were in excellent spirits , and to outward seeming the worthy purser had no care in the world . In spite of competition from pistons below and foghorn above he was delighting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sick of the beach and our money was gone , Away , down Rye-O , We signed in this packet to drive her along , An ' we 're bound to the Ri-i-o Grand ! " " Oh , that 's wonderful , and such melody , " warbled Mrs. Bannister . " I wish you 'd sing some of those at the Concert . " " I might forget myself and sing the real capstan words . " " Music and the ocean seem to go together , do n't they ? I 've been crooning to myself all afternoon , Speed , bonny boat , like a bird on the wing , ' my mother used to sing it to me when I was a tiny girl . She was from Tidewater Virginia , you know they have so much soul . " Miss Shaugraun was always roused to perversity by the mooingsof Mrs. Bannister . " I suppose the genuine sea songs are always bawdy , " she said . " Probably that was why Ulysses made his sailors put wax in their ears while the sirens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's really only a biological gesture , a form of rut , ha-haugh ! Like the wail of the tomcat or the nuptial dance of the bustard . " Dr. Chrisdie entered just then , raising his eyebrows ; the purser hastened to pour sherry . He had planned his little group with care , so he was surprised when the three Men of Sin also appeared . They had a keen intuition for any sociability , andp125after their rehearsal they had followed Dr. Chrisdie . He dodged around various passageways , but they stuck to his trail ; and Geoffrey followed theirs . " What 's a bustard ? " asked Geoff , just as he looked cheerfully through the doorway . " Not me , " said Mr. Snead . He was carrying a small silk American flag , which he handed to the boy . " Here you are , bub , stick that in your Yorkshire pudding . " He dazzled Geoffrey with a direct gaze brightened by smokeroomharmony . " Bring you luck for the raffle . " " Why do you call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Country ! " ejaculated Mr. Snead 's two colleagues . " Sit down , gentlemen , " said Mr. Huskisson , attempting toresume command . Miss Bristol remarked to herself that the quartic , as she called them , were in good form . Even Dr. Chrisdie 's sallow cheek showed a spot of enthusiasm . " Where 's Brother Murk ? " said Mr. Snead . " I miss the rumbleof his R 's  --  . " He stopped suddenly as one of his friends jabbed him with a pointed elbow . Mrs. Bannister , holding herself very erect ( the belaying by Mrs. Bootle was rather taut ) , said , " I do n't suppose he 'll leave the machine shop in this fog , poor him , but it 's a comfort to know he 's in charge of all those wheels and things . " " I 'll tell you another comfort , " said Mr. Snead . " I just noticed , there 's a lookout on the back stoop as well as up front . I said to myself , Buckingham , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more danger of somebody crowding us from behind . ' " " Let 's not be morbid , " said the purser . " This is a social occasion , I invited you to drink the health of the ship  --  also ProfessorBarton 's . We understand he is crossing his fortieth lon-gitude . " Bottoms up , " said Miss Shaugraun . " Not very well chosen as a nautical toast , " said Mr. Snead.  |p126At  that moment Boxer carried in the birthday cake beaming with small candles . " I thought you would like to cut the cake in here , " said Mr. Huskisson . " Save embarrassment in the saloon . " Geoffrey was busy with his forefinger . " Why is it so hard to count things in a circle ? " he asked . " What a wonderful purser you are , you are ! " said Aunt Kilda . " Even the correct number of wax-lights . " Boxer as usual was very alert . He produced a bottle of stone ginger for Geoffrey , and while setting down the cake indicated a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The lucky bit 's in ' ere , " he whispered . " Thank you , Boxer , " said Mr. Huskisson . " Remember , go easy on the sparrow tonight . Now we 'll cut a slice for Captain Bompjes and you can take it up to the bridge . " " ' E can use them candles up there too , " said Boxer . " It 's a rare old peasouper , not ' arf . " Uncle Dan expressed a well-simulated surprise , the cake was cut and enjoyed . Geoffrey noticed that the marked piece went to unsuspecting Aunt Blanche . " Do n't bite too hard , Possum , " he suggested just in time . These ceremonies made Mr. Snead realize that the pokergametrio were crashing a private party . But after a musical hour in the smoke-room he had comfortably relaxed his usual canny wits . Perhaps as a gesture of courtesy he should offer to do a few card tricks ? " I guess the boys and I did n't realize this was an invitation affair , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In God 's Country we 're very punctilious about introductions , I always like to exchange cards with fellow passengers bearing their load on the rough roads of life . I just got one from Mr. Chrisdie , let me introduce Mr. Elihu Van Sweringen Chrisdie , 118 Buckeye Street and pleased to meet him . Someday about dusk the Sweringen Van Chrisdie homestead will enjoy a reunion , old friends of the hurricane . " " We seem to have struck a rich pocket of humor , " whispered Miss Shaugraun to Miss Bristol . " Rich , the very word , " continued Mr. Snead . " A most successfultrip , ladies ; in Manchester alone I sold enough leather belting to go round the waist of the world . As for the traveling expenses , Mr. F. X. Marple has helped . " The purser was gently urging him to resume his seat . Mr. Snead bowed politely to them all , took from a neat leather folder a card engraved Mr. Buckingham L. Snead , Genesee ValleyBelting Company , and laid it very carefully on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he murmured , sank against Dr. Chrisdie 's shoulder , and went peacefully asleep . " A hot time in the old town tonight , " said the patient Mr. Huskisson . The Concert was Geoffrey 's first formal public occasion and he was congested by the number of askable questions . " Why did Mr. Snead go to sleep ? Are those Uncle Dan 's best clothes ? Do you feel jubious ? Will the parrot be here ? Do they have thrippennybits in America ? If Aunt Blanche could n't spend the lucky coin , she might give it to him ? Perhaps it was unlucky that sitting to enjoy the Concert he was next to Aunt Kilda . Her replies were so much more audible than anyone else 's . " The chosen symbol of a congregation 's devotion . Ha-haugh ! " she announced apropos the thrippenny bit . " You 'll have to do better than that , " said Mr. Marple , to whom a red velvet bag had been entrusted for taking up the collection . Only Mr. Huskisson knew the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapel in Wallasey ; privately he did n't think it was lucky because the inside smelt like copper . However he had explained to Uncle Dan that when the collection was announced the Chairman must mention that the Westernlandheld a record for high contributions among ships of her class . In token of this she had a flag with the emblem of the Shipwrecked Mariners Society . It was displayed in Boxer 's dec/orations over the sideboard , flanked of course by the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes . It was as well that Mr. Snead was asleep in his berth when Geoffrey , puzzled by the unfamiliar banner of the S. M. S. , asked , " Is that another Old Glory ? " The revolving seats had been lubricated to avoid squeaks ; they moved easily to the long heave of the Grand Banks and Geoffrey chaired in comfortable arcs was astonished to see so large an audience . Indeed the whole passenger list had rallied themselves or been chivvied out by Stretch and Mrs. Bootle . At least , they thought hopefully , the Concert will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foghorn . People whom Geoffrey had only seen as blanketed mummies on deck or bathrobedinvalids tottering toward Shanks 's porcelain were now rotating passively behind him . A small stage had been set abaft the sideboard , Mr. McScoon had spiked down the ship 's two potted palms on each side . The flags were draped to conceal the shelf of condiments but Geoffrey kept an eye on the bottle of Major Grey 's Chutney , the regular vibration of the foghorn had jarred it loose and it was slipping gently in front of a ripple of bunting . Neither the Thorofare nor The Drift had prepared him for the splendors of evening display . Perhaps not even the maddeninghowl of the siren every ninety seconds was as startling as Mrs. Lotus Bannister in the slithering rustle of her froufrou . " Who is that hissing ? " he trebled but they had scarcely hushed him before the sibilant expanse of shot silk , green and peacock , wafted down the aisle . Why does n't it go all the way up ? Geoffrey wondered , but the foghorn intervened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now took the platform . Even his all-forgiving sister thought he might not have looked quite so defeatist . Perhapsit was partly the batter pudding which the chef had served at dinner as a birthday surprise . He had put on his dinner coat in last-minute haste ( after Dr. Friedeck vacated the cabin ) but discovered too late that his only dress linen had been worn oncep129too often at the high table in Cambridge . " What is that on Uncle Dan 's shirt ? " Geoffrey asked . " That 's a varsity education , " said Aunt Kilda . " Port wine , ha-haugh ! " Uncle Dan balanced himself as nearly as possible abeam the potted palms . There was a smatter of applause , for everyone knew it was a birthday . Accidentally he seized one of the fronds and cut his finger . He said , " I have a message from the Captain , " and on that instant the foghorn drowned everything . " Even if he ca n't be with us we can hear him , " he said . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start . Everybody else is at church , wrote Dr. Chrisdie , and likely they need it after last night but this darned foghorn has got me too jumpy . I can hear them singing Those in Peril on the Sea , at least I can hear Shaugraun . The worst peril of the sea is social , as I figure it . Shaugraun was as audible as the foghorn last night , maybe that sherry the Purser set up . What with her and young Geoff , I really felt sorry for Miss Barton and Miss Bristol . Shaugraun was talking it all over in her stateroom afterward . I do n't see why nobody tips her off that the ventilating system which circulates bad air from one room to another also circulates Shaugraun . Anyhow , she has taken such a stunner against Friedeck and Marple she has laid off me . Of Marple ( maybe of me too ) she said , " Typical American face , my dear , something tight and skinny about the jaw which however never prevents it from opening . Ha-haugh ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry . When we tried to get into bur room to dress Friedeck was in his Meinself and Gott mood and locked the door . I suspect B. had planned a nice little speech about hands across the scuppers and the gallantryof seamen , but something certainly put him off his stride . He should n't have introduced Lotus as " our representative ofp130the Gibson Girl . " It only inflamed her . Among other things she recited that old chestnut about The Barber Kept on Shaving , which probably excited Boxer . He got pretty fresh in his Cockneyway , began by alluding to the chairman 's beard and then did a couple of limey songs very cleverly but caused much Britishagitation by saying " bloody . " Something about " The blarsted bloomin ' sparrow flew up the bloody spout . " Madame DuQuesnehad very kindly offered to sing a couple of French balladesand I was to accompany , but after the introduction nothing happened , I looked round and she had collapsed . Her husbandsaid the foghorn made her so nervous her " gorge " had closed up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure he meant well , he called on Dr. Friedeck . I guess Friedeck was sore at being considered a pinch-hitter . He shouted , " I put my contribution in the bag . I have nothing to say . " The foghornblew just then and Barton did n't catch it . He politely again invited Dr. Friedeck , who repeated , " I have nothing to say . " I thought maybe we could pull things together with our smoke-room minstrels  --  Snead had gone to bed but we could get by with three of us , that good old glee club harmony about the Merry Men in the Greenwood : One had a sword , Ta-ran-tara  --  One had a shield , Ta-ran-tara  --  And one had a twanging bow . I gave the boys the chord and we were all set to let fly when I saw Snead teetering down the aisle . With the usual instinct of anyone in his cups he had put on his tuxedo , thinking that would conceal his condition , but his necktie was way round to starboard and he was grinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards to several people and when he climbed up on the platform we had to rescue him from capsizing . The Purser was riding herd , trying to persuade him out , but of course this only made him stubborn . The best thing to do was start thep131singing , which I did . Snead was full of brio and did all right until the twang of the last bow string , which he followed with a magnificently timed hiccup  --  such a whang to it you could almost see the arrow leave the string . Half the audience were disgusted . The others applauded heartily and I heard Shaugraunsay , " Fishwives , the man 's an artist ! " I thought so myselfbut Pale in the Amber West was n't so good . In that one there was no way of using hiccups as part of the illusion and as the west got paler so did Snead . " She sleeps , my lady sleeps " was followed by a notable gulp and he interrupted to say , " She snores . " They gave us a charitable hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apology . " I owe it to myself as an artist , " he said ( and almost bowed himself into Shaugraun 's lap ) , " to say a word of explanation . " At this instant , with the uncanny quickness of the partly stewed , he saw that a sauce bottle was just falling off the sideboard . He reached out and grabbed it in midair like a conjurer , pretended to think it was a bouquet someone had thrown , really it was funny and everybodyroared . " A word of explanation , " he repeated . " I thought I could temper the wind to the shorn lamb , I mean time it to the music . I see  --  glup  --  I was mistaken . " He offered to do Casey at the Bat as a forfeit , and I 'd love to have heard him , but we thought it wiser to play safe . His two silent friends escorted him to a seat at the back of the saloon , still nursing the bottle . Everybody was relieved when it came time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal of harmless conspiracy . The stewards carried round the collection bag , everyone put in their tickets and Mrs. Bannister was nominated the Queen of Love and Beauty to draw the winning number . Our bunch all hoped the Barton kid would win the draw ; he had spent about half his time admiring the model in its glass caseThe service upstairs must be about over . I hear them singing Sun of My Soul , that 's the kind of hymn that comes near the end . It 's about the only sunshine there is at this moment . I justp132looked out and it 's certainly thick . Maybe we need n't have been sore about the raffle except for Snead making a scandal of it . Barton said a nice little spiel about this beautiful example of patient craftsmanship and the collection for a noble cause and we all hoped this Lilliputian vessel ( meaning the Ellen Arkins , not the Westernland ) would sail halcyon seas of make-believe . I think Geoffrey supposed because his uncle was chairman the boat was already his , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as if to receive it . Anyway Lotus was blindfolded and tenderly supported while she drew the ticket . Maybe that 's why she took such a long time groping in the bag . " Number 76 , " Barton announced . " Who holds Number 76 ? " " I do , " stated Mr. Marple . Young Chester shouted " Hot dog ! " and was up at the platform even before Mrs. Bannister was unbandaged . Most of us were disappointed but all would have been O.K. except for B. L. Snead . I think the Purser had been trying to coax him out of the saloon and likely he lost his temper . He shouted , " It 's a plant ! Ladies and Gentlemen , the cards were stacked . I saw that gentleman ( pointing to Dr. Friedeck ) hand a bunch of tickets to Mr. Marple . I demand a fresh deal . " It was a painful scene , the two kids were both bawlingand Dr. Friedeck did n't help by saying , " I suppose we should accept Mr. Snead as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never completed his conscientious report of the Concert . There was a series of short quick blasts from the siren ( its timbre rising more shrill in emphasis ) . This and a hurry of feet above suggested that Divine Service had ended in an outburst of praise and relief by the congregation . But no assembly of worship would disband quite so fast . Just outside he heard a thin squealing tin horn , strangely childish and absurd . He leaped on the settee and looked through the round window . Lifted on a wrinkled gray slope only a few yards away the fishermenseemed looking straight at him . What startled him most was that the man at the wheel of the little schooner calmly ranp133his finger along the brim of his sou'wester and flicked the drops of fog casually toward the liner . Then he spat overside and turned to look at the leech of his canvas . The historian 's record was much briefer than his notes of less serious matters . " Nearly ran down a fisherman , " he wrote . " It came very pat after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were looking over the rail as the schooner faded astern . " I 'll never complain again about the price of fish , " said Mrs. Marple . " It 's playing blindman 's buff for pretty high stakes , " said Mr. Marple angrily . Dan , though tempted , did not speak . He was guarding a secret . He had been restless during the night , whether from the fatigues of the Concert or the nerve-shaking boom of the whistle . The snores of Dr. Friedeck were almost equally trying . Before the earliest sifting of gray light Dan put on his dressing gown and went to smoke a pipe in one of the laboratories of Shanks . He had not noticed before that in the middle watch kerosene lanterns replaced the electric bulbs at certain dutypointsin the corridors . He could tell by a softer rhythm from below that the ship was slowed . Woodwork sighed to a slow and yielding refrain ; the dim light , the easy onward slopes were drowsy and comforting , even the . repeated steam blast was becoming a sound of courage , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell clatter on the tiles . The whistle was immediately followed by another in a little different tone  --  an echo ? But what out here would throw an echo ? He waited for the next blast , and suddenly was clear awake . The engines had stopped . The sagging retard of the hull was heavy in his feet . He wondered , tingled , stood alert in the opening of the lavatorydoor . There was a porthole only a few feet away , and though the glass was clouded with vapor he could see a glow of brightness . He ran swiftly a few yards down the passagep134where the door opened on the steerage deck aft . A great shape , leaking fuzzy shafts of light from her upper works , was moving slowly by . Whistle sounded to whistle  --  the other even deeper in tone . The Westernland slid so quiet he thought he could even hear the plates of the other hull crisping through slaps of water . Magnified in pale luminous glow she looked enormous ; and even while he stared she dimmed , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded miles away . An officer in oilskins came forward from the poop . " I say , " said Dan . " That was n't much fun . " The other held up a lantern . " Oh , hullo , Professor . Sounded like the Teutonic . What the newspapers call a greyhound . Think they 're ruined if they do n't log their 500 a day . She and the New York , cutting each other 's throats . " He started up the ladder , then paused . " I would n't mention it to the other passengers , Professor . What they do n't know wo n't worry them . " " It 's almost like breaking through a kind of membrane  --  that sounds silly , but one does feel changed . As though we 'd slipped into another dimension  --  do you remember the wonderfuldrawings of Alice going through the looking-glass ? " " Two wonderful drawings , " said Uncle Dan . " Back to back on two pages , " she exclaimed . "  --  you turn over and see Alice coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrill me ! " They were standing in mid-afternoon , forward of the deckhouse . Geoffrey leaned between the rails , wriggling because Uncle Dan kept a firm grip on the back of his coat collar . " It 's very humiliating to be held like that , " he observed . He was watching a sailor who stood on a grating slung over the side and twirled a weighted line . " What 's he fishing for ? "  | " For the bottom , " said Uncle Dan . " You have to feel your way across the Banks like a blind man with a stick . " " Like Pew in Treasure Island , " said Aunt Blanche . " What was that fishing-boat fishing for ? " " Codfish . You can remember that when you have to take codliveroil . That 's what makes American boys so big and strong . " " Chester is big but he is n't strong , " said Geoffrey . " His mother says he has to be humored because he has a pulp in his nose . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's doing ? " suggestedUncle Dan . " I ca n't bear to , he 's so deliberate about that yacht . " " Aunt Bee still has a surprise in the Emergency Bag . " " She 's asleep . Mrs. Bootle got her some earstops to cure the foghorn and she 's sleeping very fast . I know it 's good sleep because she 's drooling . " Blanche was looking the other way , but Uncle Dan could see a small tremor in her attitude . " If you do n't talk too much perhaps Captain Bompjes will give you a pebble from the bottom of the ocean . Sometimes they bring them up on the blue pigeon . " " How do they get there ? " Patiently Uncle Dan opened his mouth to reply , then realized that this time it was Blanche mimicking Geoffrey 's habit . They all laughed , even Geoffrey without quite knowing why . " Do you realize the foghorn has stopped ? " she said . " I wondered why I felt so relieved . " There was a pale blue shimmer ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , this is better , " said Dan . " I was monstrousfull of fleas all last night . When you get across the Banks one always wants to come up forward and look ahead . The early part of the voyage I find myself gravitating toward the stern . " Blanche waited for what seemed the inevitable query , " What 's gravitating ? " but it did n't come . The boy had sud/denly cantered off . The space he had occupied between them narrowed a little from both sides . " We could gravitate to the bow , " Dan said . " I did n't want to ' take Geoff out there . " He unlatched the gate and they went across the trestle to the long spearhead of the focsle . Dan was a little sheepish about this liberty , but looking up he saw the Captain make a friendly salute from his vantage on the bridge and took this as permission . Before them they could see the haze thinning to pink and opal , breaking away into blue tunnels and long vague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seesaw at the stern , " said Blanche . " That was where I had my big disappointment . I saw you coming and thought we 'd have a good talk . It was only to tell me about Dr. Friedeck 's mishap . Then I thought I 'd have a chance after that awful Concert , but nobody could say anything with the horn going . " " It did seem a very big voice for a small ship . " Just as well , too , he thought . He remembered the looming shape of danger that shimmered in the night . With a high leaningscend the questing prow carried them forward into opening space . He wanted to say " Do you read Whitman ? " but was tightened with shyness . The pause continued until he got frightened . " It 's going to be plane geometry now , " he said feebly . " I was getting tired of three dimensions . " The hiss of the dividing bow-wave sounded a little louder ; leaning over the concave wedge of the stem they could see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Murk , turning a valve two hundred feet away , sent them a little encouraging quiver , almost like a friendly hand behind the shoulders . But after all a ship is only a ship and not endless as a topic . " Do you ever read Whitman ? " he asked firmly.  | " Not much , I 'm afraid . I tried to , one time , but I got so out of breath . " That seemed to conclude the subject . He had felt communicativea few minutes ago , he wondered why he was so dumb . " I hope Dr. Friedeck has simmered down , " she said presently . " It must be very awkward for you , in the same cabin . " " Yes , most embarrassing . I 've had so little experience in that sort of foolishness , I do n't quite know how to behave . You see , usually I only quarrel with people I love . " Blanche was so pleased by this remark she said nothing . She thought , it 's splendid when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was all prepared to ask the Purser to put me in another room , and then to my amazement , this morning the little man suddenly offered me first go at the wash basin . He bowed very stiff , you ca n't imagine how he looks in his green pajamas , like a bullfrog , and said , I know how you feel , please do n't agitateyourself by any further explanations . We will speak no more about it . ' Was he apologizing to me or the other way around ? I think the foghorn had just about driven him crazy , he tried to sleep in his life-belt . " " The last few days were enough to get on anyone 's nerves . Even Kilda and I had the most ridiculous spat . " " I dare say it was good for her . She does ride a pretty high horse . What about ? " " Well , it was too absurd . I do n't know why I mentioned it . " But having done so , it would be worse still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to admit the real argument . " Oh , it was something about flannel cakes for breakfast . I said it was nice to have them again and she said it was just one more reminder that we were getting back to the wilds . " She found that she was staring at the overcoat button which had been the cause of the argument ; and hastily looked elsewhere . " I rather like getting back to the wilds . "  | " So do I , " she exclaimed . " How gorgeous when you break through and come out on this side . Just look at the sunshine , and even the water is a different color . I get the queerest feeling now that we 're going downhill . " " In a sense we are , we parallel what they call the hundredfathomcurve all the way down to the Delaware Capes . " " Look , " said Blanche , " they 're taking down those curtains on the bridge and Captain Bompjes is grinning . " " Yes , he ought to feel pretty good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you studied his charts . He let me look at them the other day . Just the names along the NewfoundlandCoast are poetry , every one has in it the doom or salvationof some old mariner  --  Funk Island and Occasional Harborwere two I noticed , and all those nasty little rings of dotted lines , shoals with the initials E. D. , Existence Doubtful . " " That 's how I felt . " She drew a long breath of brightening air and leaned forward over the rail . " We 're going quite fast , for us . " " Ca n't go too fast for me , " Dan said . " I 'm so eager to get back to work . " " You 're an American citizen , you have a right to feel that way . I 'm eager too but I 'm always a bit upset on landing , herded apart and classified as an alien . It was a shock the first time I came over , made me feel like an immigrant . That 's what I was , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are so accustomed to take things for granted . " " With everyone else doing the granting . Do n't I know . Immigrantsare only servant girls with shawls on their heads , or Dago laborers . You and Kilda and I , and DuQuesne and Friedeck , are immigrants too : we do n't cook soup and lay railroad tracks but maybe we do something just as important . I do n't like the word , but does n't anyone ever think about the intellectualimmigration ? " " I thought of becoming a citizen myself , " Blanche said , " but what held me back was my Father . He could n't possibly under/stand it . He 's puzzled enough just by mathematics and short hair  --  he thinks they 're both phases of the same unaccountable eccentricity . " " I ca n't help saying one is perhaps more attractive than the other , " Dan ventured . " Well , the hair was only typhoid fever . When it 's once cut off you realize how it simplifies life . " " I suppose mathematics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tutor me in Whitman , I 'll talk to you about mathematics . If you have the feeling for it , it 's an art of its own , and maybe it 's better than literature because you really touch per-fection . " Dan was rather wishing he might . " If you ever saw a country rectory in Shropshire , you 'd understand it would be inconceivable to have a daughter who thought of being an American citizen . Just outside the vestry door there 's an enormous old yew tree , it overhangs one of those ancient table-top gravestones , quite illegible , I mean the stone . Well , my Father is like that yew , he 's put his roots so far down he ca n't even imagine any other kind of earth . Maybe roots ought n't to be roots , only tendrils . " Dan was trying to visualize the Shropshire rectory . He saw the church square-towered of cut flint  --  like black poached eggs , but of course he was thinking of Suffolk . Damn , he thought , that 's roots . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could we ever explain them to each other ? Suppose CaptainBompjes were to try to tell about his ship to someone far inland ? " The best kind of roots are imaginary , like that square root of minus one you mentioned . " But as he said this he realized he was only talking , this was just a mannerly parenthesis to keep conversation going . He was really thinking such simple things he was ashamed ; and they were harder and harder to say because he had n't said them the instant they came to mind . There was a sudden grinding rattle behind them . With thep140return of fair weather the bosun was trying out steam in his winches . " Goodness , " said Blanche , " we are getting on . That 's always a sign of something , is n't it ? " " The donkey engine , " said Uncle Dan , " that 'll mean more questions from Geoff . It 's almost the only thing he has n't asked about yet . " " And here comes the donkey , " she murmured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was going to tell you , " Dan said hastily , " how impatient I am to get back to the extraordinary comedy of the U.S.A. , I mean things like Happy Hooligan and Mr. Bowser and streetcarconductors , but here it is on top of us before I could say it . " " Hope I 'm not Buttinsky , " said Mr. Snead . " I know how it is , you folks have got Channel Fever . It 's the first symptom , when everybody hustles up to the bow . It 's an English saying , the way sailors feel when they get into the Channel after a long voyage . When you know you 're that near Swanee River you just ca n't settle down to anything , not even drinking . However , that is n't what I 've got on my mind . I 've got humiliation fever . I 've been going around telling everybody I 'm sorry I broke up the cakewalk last night . All the drinking I 've done in a misspentlife , I ought to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were somewhat embarrassed and made no intelligible reply . " It was n't even very sportsmanlike to get crabby about the little Dutchman , " Mr. Snead continued . " The other boys and I had been trying to stack the cards for young Geoff , the only thing was Friedeck was so crude about it . When I saw him hand that fistful of tickets to F. X. Marple I just got sore . We had fifteen chances for Geoff out of a hundred tickets sold , but the Dutchman must have rounded up twice as many . " " If Geoff 's chances were only one in seven I am sure we had no right to complain , " said Blanche . " Mathematics is very honorable about such things . " " Darned if you ai n't right , " said Mr. Snead . " As far as gamesp141in the smoke-room go I know better than leave mathematics decideit . But naturally down in the social saloon and working for charity , a man feels sensitive about loading dice . I reckon we could have squared the Lotus-lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risky . All I 'm trying to do is beg pardon for raising a scene . What do you think I ought to say to the little Dutchman ? Maybe it 's better to leave him stew in his own juice ? " " I think you 're right , " Dan said . " He 's had one apology already , that ought to see him through . " " Well then I wo n't horn in on you folks any longer . I 'll go on with my tour of penance . I notice the mathematics of chance did well by Miss Bristol , you got the dividend from the Doc 's birthday cake . That ought to mean good luck , whatsay ?  --  That roommate of yours is quite a card , she has a powerful way of putting things . I was trying to make a sort of special apology to her because I know she riles easy . I said , It 's a pity we do n't land in little old New York , the other boys and I could take your bunch out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere 's . Of course in Philly it 's different , they put the town to bed at sunset . ' But Sister Shaugraun came right back at me . She says , I 'm glad we do n't land at New York . It 's so painful going by that Statue of Irony . ' That really tickles me , you sort of realize she 's been turning things around in her mind and they fly out irregardless . I guess she makes an amusing roommate  --  well , I better vamoose , I 'm talking too much . " " What an enchanting person , " Blanche said . " If all his apologiesare so delightful he 'll put the whole ship in a good humor . " " I do admire that quality in Americans , " Dan said . " They have a way of meeting you head on without so much preliminarysparring and precaution . I ca n't tell you how lucky I 've been in the friends who were so kind to me when I first came over . It 's extraordinary how they accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decently there is n't anything they wo n't do to help . There are some people called Warren inp142Chesapeake , they 've been so incredibly generous and as far as I could ever make out only because I had read Coleridge . They live out in the country in a remarkable old place where they used to keep slaves before the War . Now they make ' slaves out of literary people by their excessive kindness . If you should ever come down our way I 'd love to have you meet them . " " The Mathematical Society meets at Chesapeake next Christmasholidays . I 'm rather worried about it . I have to read a paper on The Functions of a Complex Variable . ' " " That sounds very sinister , " Dan said . " An essay on the New Woman ? But seriously , if you do come I 'm sure Bee would be delighted to put you up . " She did not reply for a moment , and Dan wondered if he had spoken too fast . " Wonderful sunset light , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your sister was good enough to suggestit already . " Free of fog , the Westernland mended her pace . Skirting the blue bend of the Gulf current she laid white riffle behind her , pushed her southing close to her supreme 14/ . Mr. Murk , with oil-bags over his bearings , turned up a 350-mile run . Now that it was almost too late her patrons remembered what a smart little ship she was . Mr. McScoon surprised them with delicious kedgeree and kromeskies , zested with curry powder and mushroomsand cuttings of lemon ; only housekeepers realized these were the cleverest way of merchandising broken meats . For the Chief Steward not less than the Purser has his Day Book . He was flattered to copy out his kedgeree recipe for Aunt Bee . As they neared the Capes they met their oldest sister Waesland , outward bound , the dean of women in that modest fleet . By Captain Bompjes ' courtesy they watched her from the bridge through the glasses , and Mr. Murk spared a curt plume ofp143steam for company salute . They could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fine old lady , " said the Captain . " Civilized ; clipper bow and figurehead , like real ships . Built in ' 67 as the Cunarder Russia . " Geoffrey was n't much impressed ; Waesland had only one funnel . Aunt Bee thought : She has a terrible lot of ocean ahead of her , poor thing . Dan focused the glasses for Blanche . As Mr. Snead had said , their minds were forward ; it was Channel Fever . It could be felt in every pulse of her metal veins . As she comes toward port from a long voyage it is true of every craft , clipper or cargo-wagon , liner or tank . With gear trimmed taut and even the idlers at lookout  --  Geoffrey could see the chef 's white hat poked outside the galley scuttle  --  she foots the paling water . That unease , anxious edge between past and future , blend of eagerness and regret , is Channel Fever . It is a sense of destination  --  and destiny . In a glamour of September noon she swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right past Cape Henlopen . Why is September sunshine the most perfect of all : has the sun also got Channel Fever , over the hill and on his downward slope ? They passed the great octagonal lighthouse , flags were up and the ship 's own personal signal , M.B.V.S. In such exhilaration none would have suspected she was indulging herself the twelve degrees of correction to compensate past errors . They were in front of the deckhouse , each with specialized excitement . Mr. Snead , apologies accomplished and forgotten , was high with pleasure to see Old Glory at the fore . He insisted on explaining to Miss Shaugraun : " First the flag of the country you 're coming to , then the house flag , then the U.S. Mail signal , then the ship 's own pennant , and the Union Jack way down at the tail . Nothing invidious , just marine etiquette . " " I dare say you 're right , " said Miss Shaugraun , " but I 'm not going to spoil my day by admitting it . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is that gunboat over there  --  gosh , that gives me a thrill . One of the White Squadron . I bet those Dons will think twice before they come up this way . Look , that 's a United States warship , see the guns , those big bumps are what they call barbettes . " " If the bullets do n't work , " said Aunt Kilda , " they throw the beef at the Spaniards . " Geoffrey was a little bewildered , the first view of America was so different from anything preconceived : no Rocky Mountains , no Indians , not even any cowcatchers , just this wide spread of yellow water . It even occurred to him they had got to China by mistake , but he was distracted by the extreme geniality of Mr. Snead who suddenly took to referring to himself as " Your Uncle Dudley . " " Say ! " he pointed . " There 's the customs boat , look at those caps with the eagle on them , that sure looks good to your Uncle Dudley . Tarara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was coming to an end and there were so many details not yet recorded in the Treasure Book . When Uncle Dan told her that the four code flags were the ship 's initials , " her autograph , you might say , " Mrs. Bannister exclaimed , " Oh , I 'm so glad you reminded me . I want you all to sign your names in my Treasure Book , I thought of it last night , I know it 's a nuisance and I argued with myself without prevail . All you good people must write your names so I 'll have something to remember you by . " " I 'll remember this voyage even without an autograph , hahaugh ! " said Miss Shaugraun . " Oh , but you must do it now before we get split up into citizensand aliens . Once those inspectors get hold of us everything is so governmental . I always say they 're much harder on the citizens . When I got that lace at Queenstown I forgot I already had my hundred dollars ' worth so I said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if they 're gentlemen they could n't possibly know . Just basted it on , you understand , I can rip it off in the train , it 'll give me something to do in thosep145terrible sleepers . Do you suppose we 'll get to Philadelphia in time to catch the train to Cincinnati ? " " Broad Street Station , " said one of the Men of Sin , triumphantat last to contribute information . " Just take a surface car up from the docks , " said Mr. Snead . In his high spirits he began whistling Daisy , Daisy , Give Me Your Answer , Do through his teeth . " They 're all surface cars in Philly , " said Mr. Marple . " You 're right . I keep forgetting we 're not landing on the sidewalks of New York . Gee whiz , I bet it 's a hundred miles up this river . " " Will you go on to Chesapeake tonight , " Aunt Kilda asked Uncle Dan , " or will you go to an hotel ? " Geoffrey was listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had opened below them into the hold of the ship . Already the chattering winches were swinging up masses of luggage . Far down he saw the black rounded top of a familiar object . How many days it had stood in the little hallwayon the Thorofare while Aunt Bee trotted up and down with armfuls of miscellany , or had consulted Grandma : " Do you think I 'll need this ? " and Grandma , perhaps concealing the tremor of her chin with her handkerchief : " Dan says the wintersare very bitter . " Was it really only twelve days ago ? " I can see your box , " said Geoffrey . " Not wanted on voyage . I bet everything in it got seasick down in the cellar . " " That 's not a box , that 's a Saratoga trunk , " said Chester Marple . Geoffrey had been avoiding him because he so exultantlycarried the Ellen Arkins round the deck in his arms . The boys now created a diversion by leaning over to look down the funnel of the revenue cutter coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put an end to their sociability for a while . A bundle of papers , thrown up from the tug , landed on deck with a thump , and Mr. Snead pounced upon it . " Hot dog , here 's the news ! New York Herald too ; say , that 's smart . Good oldp146Gordon Bennett , always first aboard . Yon can have the Ledger , Professor ; me for the Herald . Now we can find out what 's happened . American Flag Hoisted in Havana  --  hey , Chrisdie , listen to this ; that makes you feel good , how about it  --  Gather round , girls , here 's the latest  --  Roosevelt Forging Ahead for Governor . Hurray for the Rough Riders ! Colonel Hay home from London to begin duty as Secretary of State , arrived yesterdayon the Teutonic  --  " " That 's John Hay , " Dan explained to Aunt Bee .

" Teutonic in Peril . Almost a collision in mid-ocean , the steamer 's machinery stopped in time to avoid crash . Narrow escape from going to the bottom early Sunday morning . During a dense fog  --  unable to ascertain the name of the steamship which ran across her bow .  --  That must have been the same fog we were in . " " We did n't run across her bow , she came up on us from behind " . . . Dan blurted it out before he remembered . Mr. Snead looked at him sharply . " You saw it too , did you ? Same here . You might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to keep my mouth shut .  --  There 's times for opening it , too . You recollect what the Governor of North Carolina said to the Governor of South Carolina ?

It was likely to imply Bourbon , for which he had no taste , sop147he said apologetically , " I 'll join you in a small Bass . But first I better see my sister and Geoff past the immigration officers . " " Glad we got a moment to ourselves , " said Mr. Snead when they were settled later in the smoke-room . " I did n't mean to get gabby , but when the Irish countess does her high-tiddleyhi-tyeon me it sure rubs my fur . You should have threw a dornickat me the other evening and put me in my place .

I admire the idea of a few of your cultivated subjects coming over to fly their kites in our sky . If we had a few teachers like that in Genesee Valley I 'd not have been so crude myself .

I was honestly doing a kindness taking F. X. Marple away to the smoke-room so he would n't presume on your beanfeasts . I roused up notions of my own scouting round some of the best pubs in the old country . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I put it this way , Great Britain looks to me like art and the States is energy and I 'll bet each of them could give the other a hand . I know you 're a U.S. citizen so I 'm talking to a consort . If you 're ever up Genesee Valley , or Miss Barton or the kid , be sure to come slide on my cellar door . In case you mislaid my card , here 's another . You must n't think the other boys are unfriendly if they do n't hand out their cards too . They used them all up making friends in London . That 's why they 've been so sheepish . They tried to get the ship 's printer to run some off in a hurry , but you know how it was , he fell down the glory-hole and crippled himself . "  | " It 's been a very pleasant voyage , " said poor Uncle Dan . He was always dismayed in such circumstances by his lack of smalltalk . " You bet , here 's jackpots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now there 's an industrial center that this war wo n't do any harm . I wish we had deep water like that up our way , the biggest common carriers right alongside the dock . Even going into New York you do n't see a line of chimneys like that . Just look out of the window , Professor . How 's that for industrial scenery ? " As they did so a clear voice was heard from the deck . " How gruesome to spoil the landscape with all those gasometers . " It was a tribute to Mr. Snead that though he shuddered slightly he made no retort . He winked at Prof. Barton , finished his highball and only said gently , " What a word for gas tanks . " Uncle Dan knew what Geoffrey had in mind when he asked " How do you go to bed at thirteen ? " This was because he had once been told , incautiously , you go to bed at eight because you 're eight years old . So Uncle Dan replied elliptically , " It 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Perhaps people go to bed later in America , " said Geoff hopefully . By the time the ship docked , and the good-bys and tips and Mrs. Bootle 's embrace had all been performed , he was too weary to notice or care . There was a moment on the gangplankwhen he remembered with protest that he had n't said farewell to the parrot , but this was soon forgotten by the curiousbehavior of the pier itself . After so many days of the Westernland now the solid footing rolled and hummocked beneathhim . He stood a moment swaying solemnly to study this phenomenon , and when someone jostled past , he fell flat . Aunt Kilda consoled him with history : " That 's William the Conquerorat Hastings . When he jumped ashore he stumbled , butp149he turned it to a good omen . He grabbed two handfuls of earth and said , So I take seizin of English ground . ' " Geoffrey looked about for a chance to repeat this notable gesture , but remarked with unusual restraint : " I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carriage by the time they reached the old Continental . " Is this an hotel ? " he asked , with unconsciousecho of Aunt Kilda 's accent . " You bet it is , " said Uncle Dan , who seemed to be talking in a different tone of voice ever since they landed . " A very famous hotel . This is where Charles Dickens and Abraham Lincoln both stayed . " " They needed a larger room than this , " said Geoff . " Now you 're just going to have a nice dish of tapioca and go right to bed , " was Aunt Bee 's comment . " They do n't have tapioca when you 're abroad . " He was relieved when he found that they did n't . Aunt Bee baffled the chambermaid by asking for French plums , and what finally arrived was French toast . It was served to Geoff in bed by a colored waiter , and he fell asleep in the happy assurance that he had met Uncle Remus at last . Dan was on fire to give Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like to leave the child alone in such savage surroundings , but Geoff was very sound asleep and she was persuaded to take a brief stroll up Market Street . They walked as far as Broad Street Station , to buy their railroadtickets for the next day , but Dan would not let her see a cowcatcher . " I 'm saving that for Geoff . Did I tell you the story of my first American train ? I had only a minute to catch it . I rushed up to the gate and asked the man : Can I take this train to Chesapeake ? ' He said , That 's all right , brother , the engine 'll take it . ' " " I think that was very saucy of him . " In spite of her reluctance to commit herself , he could see that Bee was interested in the lighted windows . " They wear veryp150complicated hats , do n't they ? How much is $4.95 ? Goodness , more than a pound ? It would be eight shillings in Ipswich . " " The shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Everything does look very bright , but just a little bit shoddy ? " They were very gay in the daycoach next morning ; as Geoff said , his P.R.R. engine knew the way already . Dan did n't even go into the smoking-car or read his copy of Puck , he was too interested in showing them everything . The conductor , reading the labels on their bags , said " Welcome home ! " and entered into a friendly conversation . Bee was enchanted ; Dan had never seen her show such unconscious coquetries before . " What a handsome guard , " she said . " And all those brass buttons ! I thought at first he was an Admiral who had mistaken us for old friends of his . " Geoffrey asked , " Do you have to buy a ticket for your hat ? " After an hour or so they came to a noble river which they crossed slowly on a long bridge . Dan waited until they could see the view of woods and hills upstream . " What do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It must be a very high tide . What is it , the Mississippi ? " " The Susquehanna , " said Uncle Dan proudly . Geoffrey , who had been amusing himself in the aisle with the toy engine , looked up quickly . He flattened his nose against the windowpane , and murmured the syllables to himself . Susquehanna . That was it . That was the Word.  |p151Skinny  Granger was late for the meeting but it was n't fair to accuse him as the other members were doing . " I bet he 's finishing his homework first , " said Star . " That 's a stinking way to do , that 's punko . " " Anybody who does homework first is a horse 's horse , " said Bert . " Aw gee , keep that paint out of my hair . " Jeff had the post of vantage on top of the ladder so any drippings from the brush fell on the others . They were in such a hurry to get the new name up in front of the club-house that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old G.C.C . and the new T.S.O. 4 made a muddled anagram but one they viewed with satisfaction . " It 's a good thing he 's late , " said Jeff . " He 'll be extremely surprised . The Game Cocks Club turned into The Sign of Four all of a sudden . " " Shucks , we had a quorum , did n't we ? " " Do you think he 'll cry ? " said Star , whose own personal vanity was that he never did . But even that could be made a chance for torture . Bert 's father was a doctor and Bert had in/vented the rhythmical cry " Yay , yay , he has n't any tear ducts "  --  and the harder Star struggled to summon up moisture the more arid his eyes became . " If he cries , " said Bert , " we 'll have to go back to the old name . It 's discipline . " The most important rule in the Constitution of the Game Cocks Club had been the penalty of reversion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching teens , was earnestlytrying to live down an earlier nickname which suggested some highly personal reproach . This was a matter of some concern to Jeff . He had suffered so much from ironical cries about Thomas G-offerson and G-offersonDavis that any suggested return to the unmanly spelling was horrible . Prudently he tried to forestall . " Just the same , " he said , " it is n't fair to call him Baby . It 's that brace on his teeth that makes his eyes get wet . He had to go to the dentist after school , that 's why he 's late . " " I know what we 'll do , " said Bert , " we 'll hang our handkerchiefson the gate , then if he gets here with his eyes running he can wipe them before we have to notice it . " This seemed a good idea but it failed in effect because even Skinny did not recognize those three atrocious rags as handkerchiefs . " Dentist or not , there 's got to be Penalty , " said Star . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; this was a critical moment . It had become a depressing ritual that when club meetingsdeveloped into physical shindy ( as they always did ) he was usually the scapegoat . If it was Bunker Hill or Fort McHenryhe had to storm it , if a naval engagement it was someoneelse who cried " Do n't give up the ship , " in Indian warfare he usually represented the unfortunate Braddock , and how many times he had given up his cutlass at Yorktown . " Did n't anybody but Cornwallis ever give up his sword ? " he once asked Uncle Dan . " Try Robert E. Lee , " Uncle Dan suggested . Jeff did so and alas , that was what started the rebel yell , " Yay G-offerson Davis ! " I thought people came to America to getp153away from History , he brooded . He was finishing the 4 in T.S.O. 4 , and his hand shook . A large gob of green fell on Bert 's nape but in the flush of a great idea Bert was too excited to object . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They amended it into the Constitution at once before Skinny could arrive and enter protest . That accounted for the stains of paint on the document and additional blotches when they tried to force Skinny to sign : " Skinny to be Moriarty , unannimus . " Skinny managed to scratch out unannimus but he had to sign . Fortunately he did not know how many humiliations the role of Moriarty would involve . He had not accompanied the other boys to see Sherlock Holmes . Worse still , he had been taken instead to Sothern and Marlowe and was under the hatefulsuspicion of having enjoyed it . Poor soul , as he trudged up from dentistry , his mouth a large warm ache where the wires had been tightened on his rabbity teeth , he even meditated suggestingto the G.C.C . a production of Shakespeare in the coachhouseloft . It was a shock when he found that the club and all its rites had transformed overnight . He did n't even know what T.S.O. 4 meant and very unfairly he had to promise to be Moriarty before they would tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fen Dr. Watson . " This was Star . " Dibbies on Lestrade , " Jeff said hurriedly . " Put him in the gas chamber , " cried all three and they hustled Skinny to the odorous old henhouse . There was enough ammonia there to warrant anyone except Star weeping a little , but when the members retired exhausted to the hayloft the quorum showed some compunction . There were no handkerchiefsleft but some of the hay was fairly clean . " Stinkers , darned old stinkers , " moaned Skinny  --  which was by now even truer than he realized . " Let 's make a concession , " said Jeff , " he can be Mrs. Hudson . " This really was generous , for Jeff had rather thought of thatp154performance for himself . It turned the ground of argument . Skinny saw his chance . " Yay G-offerson , Long-Word G-offerson ! " he screeched and this time it was Jeff at the bottom of the scrimmage . Uncle Dan said it was a pity that the houses in the 1900 block were neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 1910 was getting old very quickly . This was particularlytrue on rainy afternoons when Jeff and Skinny played Paper Soldiers . Spontoon 's stationery store down on North Avenuekept a wonderful stock of those sweet-smelling cardboard sheets on which the armies of a bellicose planet were lithographedas romance . There were Rough Riders , Cuban patriots , Zouaves , U.S. regulars , Scots Highlanders ( kilts and busbies ) , bearded Boers , and even British redcoats of high shootability . Ten or a dozen to the sheet in their bright colors they were an immediate temptation for scissors and glue ; Uncle Dan was kept smoking more than was good for him to supply empty matchboxes on which the figures were pasted to stand upright . One of Aunt Bee 's grievances was to find a little pile of loose matches where Jeff had emptied them out in order to use the box . Skinny was in worse plight , his father was a clergyman who did not smoke , and he had to cadge empty matchboxes from the neighbors . These armies were enlivened by other figures too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bison , or the Deadwood Coach attacked by Indians . When the forces of Jeffland and LaGrange faced each other with pea-shooting artillery their battle lines were variegated with cut-out Indian chiefs , buffaloes , the pony express and galloping Wells Fargo coaches . It was a technical understanding that an Indian chief must fall twice before being put out of action ; this because his feathers were so arduous to scissor . One characteristic of a house neither new nor old , Unclep155Dan learned , is the transfusion of sound . His study at the back of the second floor was at the end of the passage which gave good scope to pea-cannon and marbles . He had discovered in Aunt Bee 's provisions for the wilderness one of the old Wilford sandbags to stop draughts on a doorsill . This laid at the foot of his study door slightly cushioned the impact of rolling marbles , but the political dialogue of the warring nations was perfectly audible . Sometimes he remembered that his idol Coleridge had also been beset by children as well as Persons from Porlock ; though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit . The adoptive parent is often more patient than the actual and he tried to believe that every child is Kubla Khan or the Ode on Intimations . It was only with Skinny that Jeff played Paper Soldiers to the full reach of fancy . One knows by instinct with whom one may confide ; with Bert or Star the game was Paper Soldiers only , but Skinny entered with perfect understanding into the conception of Countries . During the reconnaissance , the actual engagement , or the calculus of gains and losses , both commanderscarried on what were two soliloquies rather than conversation , two imaginations independent but mutually stimulated . On this occasion LaGrange had won a considerable victory . Because Skinny had traveled from Patapsco Street carrying his armies in a crackerbox through the rain he was allowed the advantage of a fortified position . It was called Martello Tower ; it bore a disconcerting resemblance to the chamber pot from under Jeff 's bed , but they had pasted paper around it as disguise . The light musketry of the pea , the heavy artillery of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then a sudden rush of Colonel Cody 's bisons had overwhelmedthe old guard of Jeffland . The Battle of Martello was a famous victory for LaGrange . " Jeffland is in a turmoil , " said the President . " The citizens are thronging into the streets in unprecedented numbers . "  | ( Uncle Dan grinned , recognizing the phrase from some historicalchapter he had been reading aloud not long before . ) " The LaGrangers are ecstatic , " said the Governor of that country . " This great victory encourages them to something the Powkeepsie has had in mind for some time . " ( The " Powkeepsie , " the name of the governing council of LaGrange , was a term that Jeff really envied . ) " They 're having a secret session , " continued the Governor , " to consider changing the name of their country .  --  What 's different from a virgin ? " In the glorious lucidity of a young mind the President of Jeffland knew precisely what was worrying the Governor of LaGrange . Allusions at school  --  the Virgin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonwealths of Virginia and Maryland  --  the oppression of older sisters " The people of LaGrange are extremely romantic , " mused the Governor . " They want a Queen , but she 's too old to be a virgin . " " They could have a matron , that 's older than a virgin , " suggested the President . " There is n't anything else . " He was not very certain but neither was the Governor . " Is Aunt Bee a matron ? " " Of course she is , " said the Governor . " A matron is anybody who does the marketing . She 's too grown up to be a virgin .  --  Howwould Matronia do for a name ? " " It is n't fair to upset the populace just because you want to have a coronation . Nothing disturbs the citizens so much as changing the name of the country . " " It 's very serious , " said the Governor , " but if they do we can draw the maps all over again . That would be fun . My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to have a country called Afterthought , where they can have some really good government . " " You could pacify them by just changing the name of the administration . You can be Mugwump  --  or there 's Rajahs . Keepp157it LaGrange and be Rajah . There 's too many matrons anyhow . Patapsco College is full of them . " " That 's good , Rajah of LaGrange . Slick ! That 's hunky-dory , and they can have a vice-Rajah who 's an Amazoon . " " Dibbies on Amazoon , " exclaimed the President . " In the humiliation of defeat the Congress of Jeffland impeaches itself into the Amazoon . They 're very querulous about the result of this campaign , there 's going to be a great civil war testing whether the nation can survive . " The Rajah was so much interested he forgot his own political troubles . " You 've got to have an issue , " he said gravely . " They 've got a wonderful issue . They ca n't make up their minds whether to keep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangled their commerce , the common carriers keep bumping into each other , they 're going to have a tremendous highway right through the middle of the country called ThorofareExtended , and everybody 's got to keep to the right . " " Except Virgins ! " shouted the Rajah . " That 's how you can tell . " " Let 's go down in the dining-room and use the table , " said the President , rubbing abraded knees . " I 've got a name for a new town , it 's called Kneepad . " " Dibbies on Splinter , " said the Rajah . Uncle Dan had overhead this game often enough to understand the allusions to that scurfy floor in the passage . Thinkingof mending-baskets he hoped that the chivalry of LaGrange and Jeffland were wearing the pads . Physical accidents during play were faithfully reflected in cartography . Not without reasondid LaGrange 's picturesque island of Corduroy have a town called Split . Dan was so happy in the prospect of escape from lodgings that when he went househunting he would have chosen almostp158anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as a kind of symbolism . Carroll Street was near Patapsco College , the rent was within his means , and the first time he studied the two facing rows of small brick homes was one of those sultry spring twilights when Chesapeake digests its fried chicken and hominy sitting on the stoop . The earliest fireflies of the year were blinking Morse code in the scaly sycamoretrees and along the series of little white marble steps sat pretty girls in ruffled dresses . Frequently they rearranged their overlapping draperies , gathering them about ankles that seemed too fragile for the mileage they would undoubtedly incur . Young men suitable for the purpose sat in homage at respectful gradations . The Life Force had produced them with punctual prodigality . The dialogue , alternating hoarse cackles and gurglingmush , was not less vapid because in the adjoining parlor windows sires lurked in shirtsleeves behind the evening paper . Student and lover of speech , Uncle Dan eavesdropped as he prowled along . In his early days at Patapsco he thought the Chesapeake patois was simply an unconscious biological chuckle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was actually an articulated language . But all consonants were submerged in a syrup of vowels . It sounded like American marmalade , too sweet . No word ever came crisply to an end but fondly impeded the next one . Among Dan 's burdens was a course called Declamationand Forensics . He startled his pupils one day by writing on the blackboard : I beg you , not so mum the word : Your diction , like your mind , is blurred . But now , in evening languor , the soft slopping talk was provocativeand kind , like a mulled sweet wine . It sounded somehow like Omar Khayyam : Edward FitzGerald would have loved it . Barton , do n't be such a prickly Puritan , he said to himself , smilingto consider what the Thorofare would think of its young sitting out to collogue on doorsteps . And how delightful to seep159that the Chesapeake belles , even bracketed by papa at the window and swains at their ankles , were so entirely in command of the situation . Woman , he thought , is a deponent verb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a good epigram for English VII . . . . Perhaps Carroll Street is the kind of place that puts ideas in one 's head ? The more strident small boys of the neighborhood could be heard , mercifully remote , from a bushy vacant lot a couple of blocks away , along Division Road . In the after-supper drowse there were no wheels on the cobbles and Carroll Street gave an illusion of quiet . Then at number 1910 Uncle Dan saw the sign FOR RENT , and even one of those telltale mirrors called " busybodies " projecting from a three-sided bay upstairs . His decision was prompt . He knew it would never be possible to lure Aunt Bee into the sociability of the front steps , but surely she might enjoy watching it reflected above . When he inspected the premises later with the agent his observation was superficial . The little back room upstairs , overlooking the yard and the alley , appealed to him as a study . He visualized his books along the wall and a couch for siesta with Rider Haggard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumping down the alley crying the seasonal chantey " Strawbe-e-y , Nice Fresh Strawbe-e-y , " and this seemed an additional picturesque . The dreamer did not then conceive how often the cries and clamors of the alley would come between him and his dream . He did say vaguely , " I wish there were a third floor , it would be so useful for working , " but the agent , that ready debater , replied ( in the drawl which is so dangerous because it sounds so innocent ) , " You would n't cherish another trudge of stairs for yo ' good lady to climb ? " So Uncle Dan accused himself of deficient chivalry and easily agreed . It may have been the numbers of the 1900 's that prevailed . Who remembers now with what hopeful anticipation men of good will looked forward to that mystic date . Perhaps Uncle Dan specially , for he was often happy in small private fetishes ,  |p160omens  , and computations . For example the Hazlitt necktie , which for some chancy reason he associated with the ulcerated essayist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his lecture on Hazlitt , and one of his rare quarrels with Aunt Bee was when , not realizing its inspiration , she cut up the tawny silk for a quilt . And so he philosophized the even numbers of the 1900 block as an orderly vista of fortunes to come . He foresaw himself returning in afternoon peace from the task work of the classroom and like a rider on Mr. Wells 's Time-Machine collapsing the momentum of the years , at any rate as far as 1910 . How far away that looked . And by 1910 perhaps the Professorship at Chesapeake would have been achieved and perhaps even a house in real country . In his usual route from the college Dan passed all the dates on Carroll Street from 1700 to the new century , and reflected cheerfully that these were also the limits of his literary duty . When going downtown he crossed North Avenue into the 1 boo 's he felt like a boy at recess . Here were centuries of escapadewith which he had no professorial concern . Some of his students got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had difficulty with dates to visualize them by house numbers on their own streets . No wonder , he said , Alexander Pope ( the greatest virtuoso who ever lived ) was good at couplets : his " dates " were 1688 to 1744 . One of the girls , taking him too seriously , prepared herself for an examination by staring so earnestly at 1744 Patapsco Street that she was insulted by one of the boarders . Memory is careless of chronology . Afterthought of what one loves , as Jeff learned and loved Chesapeake in those years Before the Fire , is casual to and fro . But very early in the Carroll Street days came a loud scream which he could not choose but hear . It was the Ma and Pa . That mimic railroadp161hiding in the gorge below the North Avenue Bridge sent two leisurely trains a day winding the valleys toward Harford County . It was a Book of Genesis railroad , Uncle Dan said , created on Sixth Day with the other creeping things . When Jeff hankered for a toy train like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one practically in the back yard . TheMARYLAND &; PENNSYLVANIA ( so the cars were labeled in widespacedrailroad lettering ) had no false vanity . It would stop anywhere , all you needed to do was build a little scaffold and put out a milk can . Patrons had an almost protective affection for it . The cowcatcher was sharper , the smokestack taller , the whistle shriller , the conductor more benevolent than anywhere else . Even the conductor 's gold watch was bigger , because ( he told Jeff ) we have more time on this road . It was said to have one spare locomotive , whether Ma or Pa ; Bert Eutaw maintainedthat he had seen them both and could tell their sexes apart . Ma , he said , always ran backward ; he had even formed some erroneous biological theory about this . Though there were two engines the train was always the same : a flat car , a box car jingling with milk cans , a blind baggage , and one passenger coach . Ma and Pa traveled with domestic fidelity to and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had any wider yearnings . Few people ever learned where the two met and passed ; the single track must somewhere be supplemented by a siding , but it would n't need to be a big one . Even a Wilford train would look large compared to Ma and Pa . That was one reason why Aunt Bee enjoyed it so much . It was one of those unexpectedly hot days early in October when Uncle Dan took them out to Greenaway . Jeff was naturallymuch excited by his first glimpse of the small railroad , of which Uncle Dan had given almost too much preliminary description . There was time to study the engine before they mounted the train ; Jeff asked the engineer , " Is this Ma or Pa ? " " This is Ma , " he said , adding confidentially to Uncle Dan , " You can always tell , she 's got two humps on the boiler. "  |p162Aunt  Bee , who was often subject to minute annoyances , was more concerned by a mosquito bite on the tip of her nose . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she found all the windowscarefully screened . To a Wilford eye this was merely a wanton blockade to keep out fresh air . So without asking anyone'sadvice she removed her bedroom screens , and lay awake with Puritan grimness while beset by all sorts of methodical biters and buzzers . She supposed this was a part of frontier life , and was well speckled by morning . Something in her untainted Suffolk blood must have appealed to the creatures . " What terriblemidges you have here , " she said . Uncle Dan warned her not to scratch , but of course she did . She felt it unfortunate that she should be so spotty on her first visit to Uncle Dan 's important friends . But the novelty of the trip soon distracted her from small troubles . The valley of the stripling Jones , though the name seemed odd to her , is no less beautiful than the Valley of Fern , but the latter has nothing like a stand of gum trees in their purple climax , or maples catching fire from hill to hill . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as Bealings . " " I thought it must be farther than that because the trees look so tall , " she said mysteriously . " How can you tell if it 's the right hand or the left hand ? " Jeff asked , " because there 's only one track . " " Everything is such a queer mixture of familiar and strange , " said Aunt Bee . " What is a cotton duck ? " asked Geoffrey . " Is that a toy for small children ? " They were passing a large mill beside the stream and he noticed the sign " Woodbury Cotton Duck . " " It 's a sort of canvas , " said Uncle Dan . " I 'll tell you somethingthat will surprise you . One time when we were in Harry Bredfield 's Scandal I noticed his sailcloth was Woodbury . So you see we 're not really so far away . " " I bet it 's always high tide in America , " said Jeff , pursuingp163his own thoughts . " I saw something in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a different kind of tide . Do n't say too much about Gettysburg when we meet Major Warren . " The magic of Greenaway always had a special effect upon Uncle Dan . He tried to explain to Aunt Bee : " Nothing could be more American and yet in the queerest way I always feel so close there to the best of England . Perhaps it 's because it 's so George the Third . A great deal of Chesapeake is pure eight-eenth-century . " " I do n't know about pure , " said Aunt Bee . " I must say I 'm questionable about the cobblestones and the drainage running down the gutters . In some ways it seems more behind-the-times than Ipswich . " Her noticing spirit had been surprised by the rich exhalation of Jones 's Falls in autumn sun . And she had already had glimpses of some of the famous alleys inhabited by what she called darkies . Aunt A. and the Band of Hope would not have accepted them without a struggle . Uncle Dan had not grieved much about the sociology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister 's eye had been so alert . It was a contradiction of Jeff 's enthusiastic but prematureremark : " America is large and clean and new , England is small and old and dirty . " To the scholar it was rather an amusing paradox that a great American city should still be living almost in the sanitation of Queen Anne . " Wait till you see our great beauty spot , " he said . " Jones 's Falls at sunset on Wash Day . All the rinsing water from this side of the city flows into the stream and by afternoon it 's the most beautiful copper blue . People hang over the North Avenue Bridge to admire it , like the Arno at Florence . " " Very jubious , " said Aunt Bee . It was a different phase of the eighteenth century that Uncle Dan relished at Greenaway . " This is one of Major Warren 's Sunday breakfasts , " he told her . " There may be other peoplep164there too " ( Aunt Bee cautiously dabbed her nose ) , " or it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened . He told me one time how the breakfast parties started . His father , Tullius Teackle Warren , such a gorgeous name , was really a devotee of the arts and escaped from business as much as he could . It 's quite a story , Tullius Teackle spent some time in England as a young man and made all sorts of sentimental pilgrimages . His great ambition was to meet Coleridge but by the time he got there old Sam was too ill or too queer to be seen . But the young Warren prowled around and made an acquaintance with HartleyColeridge up in the Lake District . He even met Daddy Wordsworth , they were all very kind to him : they were astonishedthat a young American should be interested in their doings . The Major pretends to think that all this was partly because his father was born in 1809 when there was such a tidal wave of literary progeny . He says if anybody is planning to have babies nowadays he recommends waiting until 1909 , that might be a lucky year too . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of his father he knows more about the Wordsworths and Coleridges and all that period than most college professors . " " I shall feel very shy if they talk about nothing but litera-ture . " " Do n't worry , that 's only when the Major and I get off by ourselves . He has a marvelous library of his father 's books . You try Mrs. Warren on cooking . She wants to know how to make treacle tart , only she says they 'll call it Teackle , that 's the name of her son . It 's a family name round here . But about the breakfasts , when the old Mr. Warren was in London as a youngster he got invited to one of Crabb Robinson 's famous breakfast parties and when he came home he started the same sort of thing for himself . Several times a year he would ask people who enjoyed ideas to come out and spend Sunday morningsitting round the table . Then everybody takes a nap until tea time . You must be sure to drink some of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privateer clippers and they either stole the wine on the high seas or else used it as ballast , I do n't remember . " Aunt Bee was a little confused as to the different generations of the Warrens but she decided to be her own wary self and accept things as they came . Major Warren and young Teackle met them with an old shiny barouche at the tiny shed which was Greenaway 's own flag-station on the Ma and Pa . By happy coincidence their host himself had what he called a sty on his nose  --  perhaps Madeira rather than mosquito . Even Jeff 's private sensibilities were assuagedwhen one of the Major 's first remarks was , " I 'm glad you wore good solid boots . Teackle wants to take you for a scramble . " This made Jeff feel better about the K-boots . He explained to Major Warren , who had a courteous air of attention that made one feel important . " I 've been embarrassed , " Jeff said formally , " because Americanboys do n't wear K-boots , but they can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ask you if you know about the Stamp Act and suddenly they jump on your feet . If you 've got K-boots you do n't feel it . " Aunt Bee was relieved by Major Warren 's weathered and countrified look , his old-fashioned brown frock-coat and riding breeches reminded her of Wilford on market day . He limped a little too , which softened her . " I 'm glad you-all came out with Ma , " he said , saluting the train crew . " She does n't seem to throw as much soot as Pa . I 'm afraid our toy railway is a shock to you after those beautiful trains on the Great Eastern . I 've never forgotten a hamper of tea I had on the Yarmouth Express . I wish we could paint Ma and Pa bright blue like those engines of yours but it would be only a burlesque of a great work of art . " " Then you must have been through Wilford , " said Aunt Bee , quite excited . " Yes indeed . I got tired of hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think Wilford was where my tea spilled in my lap , that wonderful curve at the bottom of your garden . You see your good brother has told me all about it . " The cautious Aunt Bee cottoned at once to the Major , and Dan was happy . He had the adoring affection of a naturally awkward man Tor the one who always says the right thing . " You-all must forgive Mrs. Warren for not having come down to make her curtsey . She takes these breakfasts right serious , and she 's up to her ears in the kitchen trying to explain to the cook how to make sausage rolls . Must have sausage rolls , your brother has talked so much about them , but we ca n't seem to get the right formula . " " And Teackle tart , " said Teackle . " Come on , Jeff , get up on the driver 's seat with me . " " It 's like the captain 's bridge , " said Jeff . " Can I help you steer ? " Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's like Rendlesham Hall , " she said , as they arrived under the long facade of rose-colored brick . " Even holly trees ! " Major Warren was much pleased but politely deprecated his pleasure . " One of your old Suffolk manors ? But I 'm sure Rendlesham Esquire would have too much sense to build a big portico he could n't afford to paint . " " What a funny smell , " said Geoffrey , relishing the exquisite sour-and-sweet which is a secret of that region . " Goodness , is it box ? " asked Aunt Bee . " It never smells as strong as that in England . And the way there 's a sniff of roses mixed up in it . " " Toasted box , we call it , " said Major Warren . " It always surprises visitors in hot weather . These hedges have been toastinga long time . Squire Rendlesham would probably have cut his down to make lawn bowls . We have a measly time in winter wrapping them up . I ca n't afford to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree I was worried about in an ice storm . Ip167tied it up in my long woolen underwear . I 'm afraid Mrs. Warren did n't approve . " Aunt Bee 's anxieties were well relieved when she noticed the antique endearing shabbiness of Greenaway . An old colored man in a white coat helped her out of the carriage as if she had been Queen Victoria . The top of his head had such crisp gray nap she would have liked to stroke it ; and his coat had been mended . Mrs. Warren was plump and cordial : her confession that the sausage rolls had somehow miscarried seemed a subtle compliment . There were no other guests and it was impossible to be formal in such a spell of warm laziness . Jeff found much to study and said little . He kept looking up at a huge bamboo fan rotating fitfully over the dining-table . " What is that propeller ? " he asked as the long slender blades came to a pause . " The motor is very primitive , " said Mrs. Warren . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Would he like to see it ? " The Major led him out into the hall and opened the door of a cupboard under one curve of the big double staircase . A small colored boy was sitting on a stool holding a cord which passed over a spindle and revolved the fan by hand . He started with surprise and his eyes and teeth looked like china in the shadow . " Try to give us a little more elbow-grease , Mutual , " said the Major . " We 're showing off for company . " " Yassuh , Major , I got sleepy . It 's this mystical weather . " Aunt Bee had been afraid she might be sleepy too , but in spite of Madeira and fried chicken , she enjoyed the conversation . Evidently there was something in the relation between the Major and Uncle Dan which put them both at their best . " He does n't always talk so biggity , " whispered Mrs. Warren , " but he says your brother is the best listener he ever gets . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off on smells . " " Remember George Fox 's remark when he got religion , " said Uncle Dan . " He said the whole creation had a different smell . " " If I could write the history of this house , " the Major continued , " it would be an essay on that subject . Your nose , Missp168Barton , is in for some interesting surprises if you ever explore downtown . Chesapeake smelled so bad in the eighteenth centurythat everybody who could tried to build a house in the country . As a matter of fact the family fortune , when there was one , came through the nose . That old fellow in the picture over the mantel , holding the ship-model in his hand , that was **25;8160;TOOLONG . He was smart enough to see that the tobacco fields around here were all smoked out ( tobacco 's a right greedy crop for soil ) and he went into the grain trade . Built himself a trading schooner to carry wheat to Bristol . He had to build a pier to lay her up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side of the basin . Smart fellow , Old Zeb , what does he do , builds an oven on the end of the pier and gets some good colored cooks to bake spoon bread and punkin pie and cinnamon bun right where the sailors could smell it . Yes , Ma'am , they come in starvin ' from a long voyage and they smell that hoe-cake and cinnamon pie and they make straight for Zeb Warren 's dock . One thing and another and likely a little free-booting in the West Indies , he did powerful well for himself . That schooner he 's holding , the Mermaid , had her masts raked back so far everybody said they 'd fall over . They said he stepped ' em that way because he had a squint and could n't see perpendicular , but it made the vessel mighty sweet on the wind . Other folks took to imitating her . Likely she was one of the first of the Chesapeake clippers . Old Zeb filled her full of wheat and he 'd bring back Bristol Milk . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Bee . " It 's a sherry , " Dan explained . " It is indeed , " said the Major . " The nut brown maiden ofall sherries , a real brunette . He built this house about 176o . Does n't seem so old in Wilford but we feel it 's right creditable . " " That was before the American Rebellion ? " asked Aunt Bee . " It always tickles me when the British call it a Rebellion instead of a Revolution , " said the Major . " No , Miss Bee , in thisneck of the woods Rebellion signifies different . The old placep169had its troubles . In the Revolution somebody burned down the kitchen wing but they never rightly knew who did it , whether the Liberty Boys or the British . " " They 've been burning things there ever since , " said Mrs. Warren , thinking of her sausage rolls . " Are we British ? " Jeff asked innocently . He had already been puzzled by this word , rare in Wilford . " British is really a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Let 's have some more Madeira . Lightfoot , fill up the glasses . It 's a good eighteenth-century drink , Miss Bee . What was really comical about Greenaway , the poor old place never quite knew what side it was on . They used to say that was why Old Zeb built that double stairway out there , one branch for Tories and one for patriots . It came in handy in ' 6i too . I tippytoed down one side to join the Confed'racy while my old man was pretending to look up the other . " " Zeb Warren was loyalist , was n't he ? " Uncle Dan asked . " Yes , not any theocratic enthusiasm for the Crown , just hardheadedmerchant , knew he had everything to lose by any kind of trouble . He was busy exporting barrel-staves to the West Indies for their molasses casks  --  probably to satisfy your British , I mean English , passion for treacle tart . But he must have used one of the barrel-staves a little too often on his son . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that unpleasant name without explaining , " said Mrs. Warren . " May as well rattle all the family skeletons at once , " said the Major , " let Miss Bee know the worst . His real name was Purvy . Anyhow , stinging with barrel-staves he run away to sea and went privateering with Whipple . He was captured by the British , I mean English , and put in the calaboose in Charleston . " That 's where he got scurvy , the only kind of rhyme he was capable of . " Uncle Dan anticipated Geoffrey . " Put in jail , " he murmured . " G-a-o-1 ? " said Geoffrey.  | " Good boy , " said the Major . " G-a-o-1 sounds much more uncomfortablethan jail ; like John Bunyan . " " Daddy was in jail himself , " said Teackle . This is a very exciting family , Geoffrey thought . " Yes , Lightfoot and I spent two years in Indiana . That was Lew Wallace 's fault . No wonder he did so well with that chariot race in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , did n't they , Lightfoot ? We dug our way out of that prison once , but after a look at that Indiana landscape I figured we might as well be back in jail . " " If you 're going to fight Secession all over again , " said Mrs. Warren , " I 'm going to take Miss Barton away for a siesta . " Aunt Bee agreed happily . The fan overhead had ceased again , the Madeira was strong , the browse of velveteen bees in the roses outside filled the great mahogany dining-room with meridianweight . She thought she saw the colored butler waver on his feet and she felt that way too . " Take her up to Betsy Patterson 's room , " said the Major . " When Betsy was going to marry a Bonaparte she figured she better have a real soaping bath . She came out here to Greenawaywhere they had a china tub and a boiler of hot water . " " What wonderful furniture polish you must have , " said Aunt Bee as she paused with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banister on each side rose shining into the shuttereddimness . " What is it , lemon oil ? " At that moment Teackle and Jeff slid down from above , one on each side . " I 'm afraid you can see what it is , " said Mrs. Warren . " Five generations of young breeches . " " What I call backside oil , " said the Major . " Tell her your story about shining up the highboy . " " I declare , Major , you 'll have her all worn out with fatigue . It 's just that we had a green colored wench and I told her to shine up this old highboy . " Aunt Bee had a half-asleep vision of a sea-green maiden rubbing the smooth wood . " I came back and found it just as dusty as ever , so I told her , 170p171Mandy , you never polished the old highboy . ' She insisted , ' Yes , Ma'am , yes indeedy , I sholy did . ' I asked her to show me how she did it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeb . The way it hangs over the chimney , she thought he must be Old Highboy . " I might have done the same , thought Aunt Bee ; I 'd call this a sideboard or a chiffonier.  --  She was glad to be led away for the promised siesta . " It 's awful hot . Can I take Jeff down to the Branch for a swim ? " asked Teackle . " Yes , after you 've shaken down that fried chicken . Take him out and show him the slave quarters . Come on , Sir , you and I will go in the Apery while the ladies take their forty winks . It will be mo'n forty if I know Mrs. Warren . She can sleep any time . It 's a wonderful trait in a woman . Lightfoot , Gens Inimica Mihi . " " Yassuh , Major , yassuh . Navigat Aequor . " " Lightfoot and I have a little code of our own , " the Major explained . " Maybe I never told you how we studied Virgil in that Yankee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't care for folks that navigates on water . ' It means ' Open another bottle . ' " He led the way through a corridor hung with guns and sporting prints into the wing of the house known as the Apery . The Major was always pleased when this name for his library puzzled visitors . Over the wide battered fireplace the mantel-beam was carved Sic Vos Non Vobis Mellifacatis Apes . " A library is a kind of honeycomb , " he said , sinking into a chair . " It sure tickles me when folks think it means something about monkeys . Have another glass of Madeira and we 'll talk . " Dan knew perfectly well what would happen . After apologizing for everyone else being so drowsy the Major would soliloquize for twenty minutes or so and then fall asleep in his chair . " Yes , Sir , Virgil has been a great influence around this plantation . When I first put up that verse my brother Randy , thep172old scalawag , he named a couple of bird dogs Vos and Vobis . He thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow , but lacking in culture , Sir . When he passed on I moved all his fowling pieces and sporting prints into the passage . I only kept that picture of Lightfoot to remind me not to bet on horses . Horses ' necks pretty near sunk this family . " The warm midday aroma of bees and box , the rump-sprung leather chair ( " Make yourself easy , Sir , you got to set your cheeks just so in that chair " ) , the colored butler muttering to himself as he uncorked another bottle , caused Uncle Dan to wonder whether he himself might drift off before the Major . " Horses ' necks ? " he asked vaguely . " Yes , Sir , the necks of other horses that Randy did n't bet on . That 's Lightfoot , that chestnut gelding over there . Not the same as this Lightfoot . " " No , Suh , Mr. Barton , " said the butler , " my name comes from the Lees of Virginia , Suh . My folks lived with them in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fantasies . Says he 's one of the Lees of Virginia . I tell him he 's one of the dregs . Do n't you shake that wine , you rascal , your old limbs getting mighty tremulous . Some time when you want fun , get Lightfoot to construe some Virgil for you . " Evidently this was a sentimental topic between the Major and his servant . Lightfoot 's gnarled hand quivered with restraintas he tried not to speak until the wine was poured . He breathed heavily with relief . " Ah never was no good at that scansion , " he admitted . " He did n't know arsis from thesis , " said the Major . " None of us did until the Commandant got interested . You see , we were all perishing of boredom , Clara Barton or the Sanitary Commission sent a box of books for us Johnny Rebs and by the time Lightfoot and I got around to it there was nothing left but a textbook of Virgil . I was always ashamed because I never had any university education . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir , there was quite a number of Confed'rate officers in that prison that wanted to read Virgil , we-all got togethera group of us , we 'd read it aloud and try to figure out what it meant . Lightfoot could n't read but you 'd be surprised what a lot of tags he picked up . We did n't any of us know how to read hexameter so it sounded like po'try , but then the Commandantof the prison got a curiosity about what we were doing , and he showed us how to elide . I reckon we sort of took advantage of his classical education . He got to thinking we were just a lot of innocent students . We got permission to set out evenings in an old laundry they had , so we could do our construing . It was right comical because while we had a crowd in front talking loud about datives and genitives , Lightfoot and some of the others was diggin ' a hole under the washtubs . " " Yassuh , " said Lightfoot , " we mighty near elided right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the tray of wine , prolonging the pleasure of reminiscence . " Recollect that Commandant act a bit irksome . He say of we try it again he give us a different kind of hexameter , six foot underground . " " You can be excused now , Lightfoot , " said the Major . " Go and take a nap , give your legs an armistice . " " What a pity Dr. Gildersleeve was n't captured with you , " Uncle Dan suggested . " Yes , Sir , I 've often thought of that . But maybe it was more fun because none of us were real scholars . There was a kind of false pride about it too . We were hell-bent to remind some of those Yankees that it was really a war between gentlemen and tradesmen . I guess the tradesmen always win . But everything was all mixed up in the Warren family . My father , for instance : every time there was a war he went abroad and stayed until it was over . Damn sensible too , that 's how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave ' em to a museum . His brother , Uncle Coalbox , was managing the railroad and fixing to get himself shot at by both sides . We called him Coalboxbecause he run the line through to the coal mines , did asp174much as anybody to win the war for Old Abe . Remarkable man , Uncle Colfax . We cut his railroad three-four times around Harper 's Ferry , but he always had the cars running again the next day . One time we got driven off when we 'd only torn up one rail going around a bend , we made the mistake to cut the inside rail and the story was Uncle Coalbox figured out just the right speed and run the train round the bend on the outside rail alone . What they used to call centrifugal force . Just a fairy tale , I reckon , but Uncle Colfax was a fool for luck . I hope I do n't weary you but I like to think this room is the home of lost causes . Your very good health , Sir . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they exchanged glances and toasted " The Northeast Trades . " His host had often explained that the old Chesapeake clippers profited by the happy coincidence of prevailing fair winds from Madeira to the Virginia Capes . " You 're real unselfish , Sir , but I think we have a relish for the same things . Ever since my Governor was captured by the British at Winander there 's been a streak of literary poison around this place . " Uncle Dan 's mind had wandered a little . " The Battle of Winander ? " " When he was captured , I mean captivated , by those Lake Poets . There was a boy , ye knew him well Winander . ' I supposeit was old Daddy Wordsworth 's name for Windermere . I used to hear my Governor say that so often , I never worry much about what it meant . We had a private car on the railroadcalled Winander . " " That would have shocked Wordsworth . He wrote some sonnetscomplaining about railways . " " Did he so ? Well the old hypocrite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares . I always mean to read more of old Daddy but it 's so much easier to go over the bits I know than to break fresh print . The Prelude was my favorite for putting myself to sleep . I often wonder how you teach poetry ,  |p175Dan  . Do you have to explain it to the students ? I never wanted it explained . Sometimes the less I understood it the more I liked it . What I wanted was pictures in my mind , like the boy rowing a boat on the lake and the mountain rising up steeper and steeper till it cuts off the moon and scares him ; or the time he goes in the woods and whistles at the owls . " The sun of early afternoon slid through an aperture of the slatted cane blinds , slowly feeling its way along a shelf , like a hesitating golden finger . Dan was curious to see what book it had reached . He rose to look and suddenly was interrupted by his own thoughts . " Do you remember , Major , Coleridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an old black copy in his father 's rectory , he never dared take it from the shelf until the sunlight struck it ? I wonder if Hartley still had that copy ? " The Major did not reply and Dan turning saw that he was blissfully asleep . The shadow of the mountain had blotted out the boy in the boat . It 's too bad , Uncle Dan thought , seeing anyone else asleep always makes me wide awake . He tiptoed out of the library by the back door and wandered in the box-garden , a rectangle of paths hedged about a central plot . The Major liked to call it a maze but it was a very simple one . Too simple , perhaps , to symbolize any actual human patterns . But college " English " was also a kind of formal evergreen garden ? He was sorry the Major had evaporated just then because for an instant  --  like the yellow sunshine on those books  --  he had felt the answer to the question about teaching . For the students ' advantage ( he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little , even if only to show there can be all sorts of explanations ; even if the children do n't take in a word you say . You better warn them that much of what you suggest will sound like desolating nonsense , but letp176them make notes anyhow : maybe ten or twenty years later some of those suggestions will begin to penetrate . Let them take time out from the proud certainties of youth to prepare themselves for the possibility of blissful doubt in middle age . . . . He laughed aloud at the absurdity of trying to convince a group of girls in their teens that middle age could have any merits whatever . Strolling the gravel paths between tart-savored shrubs he reached the dial in the center of the garden . The sunlightyawned , open wide in clear vacancy . Somewhere toward the stables he could hear the jocular mumble of the colored servants , a comfortably idle sound . III o'clock said the shadow : III sharp , he thought , the edge cut so black . In color , in smell , in slope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day that was itself already middle-aged . And yet an hour later , and later still , they would say to themselves , Now it is perfect . Marvelous that no one can ever guess beforehand how the mind compensates , finds its balance-point in every tension . He thought with delight of his attractive young pupils reveling in their harmless assurance that no one before had ever tasted the peculiarflavor of living . Politely , humorously , even respectfully , they filled their notebooks , but how impossible for them really to believe that Wordsworth or Coleridge or Hazlitt  --  or even Dan Barton  --  were still really younger than themselves in everything that mattered . It was the sun-dial that made him think of Hazlitt , connoisseur of shadows and evasives ; or maybe the warm bitterness of the boxwood smell . If he only had his class sitting here among the green alleys he could almost describeto them how literature and all the arts are woven ( implex was the word that came to mind ) into the whole stuff of lookingand growing and feeling ; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent of a page of pollened prose . Extraordinary , he said to himself , testing the different warmths of the bronze dial with his palm , I was never so happy . It 's the Major does that to me ; he got through his resentments a longp177time ago , he just drifts with the tide hoping his guts will hold out . It 's humiliating though , I most approve the Major where his tastes or ideas confirm my own . Damme , ca n't a man ever be philosophically detached ? Dan was probably thinking of the time the Major ( in the full shove of a trade wind from Madeira ) sat by this same sun-dial and uttered a soliloquy about marriage . " I never discussthese things in the house , " he said . " It 's not prudent , marriedmen and soldiers better had n't boast . No , Sir . But I reckon Miz Beuly and I made a success of it because we did n't marry too young . Everybody in Chezpeake was overcome to astonishmentwhen I took to myself a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just what they thought they meant by that , I 'm too delicate to inquire . I declare it 's risky when folks marry young  --  this is another thing you can tell your gals , Dan . They wo n't give no heed so it wo n't make any difference ,  --  because young people try to adapt themselves to each other and of cose that 's fatal . You set about adapting yo'self to someone else and you just naturally succumb . Maybe yo ' private character has no chance to develop itself a-tall . No , Sir , you make friends with yourself before you start to homage some gallivantin ' gal . There 's another feature about this here middle-aged nuptial : it offers all kinds of surprises . I thought I was past child-bearing when I married and we-all supposed young Teackle was the last fig-leaf on the tree and then , Sir , by God , ten years later along comes baby Trundle . " " You 'll have to get out of the habit of calling her that nickname , " Dan said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she wo n't like it when she gets older . " " You 're quite right , Sir ; it 's not mannerly to take advantage of a lady , no matter how young she is . The colored folks alwaysgive her full entitles , Serena Lavinia , they love long names . I reckon I 've told you why we call her Lavinia , anotherquotation from Virgil . Like Aeneas , after all his cam/paigning , Laviniaque venit , Along came Lavinia . Just a kind of enclitic at the tail of the whole biological series . " The first good sprawl since the Meadow at Wilford , Dan said to himself ; but not even midsummer on the Thorofare gave such a stupor , drugged and flooded with sun . He was lying out in the open pasture beyond the box-garden while Greenawaytook its afternoon doze . Perhaps it was one of the same fields that the Major said had had the jizzum leached out of it by tobacco . There seemed still plenty of vitality in red earth and stubble under that heavy glow . A counterpointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The weathered snake-fence cast zigzag lines of shadow like fractured staves of music . Every cricket fluting like Sidney Lanier . Dan was letting his mind soak , stew , simmer  --  faintly acrid , like toasted box  --  spread , dream , relax  --  sluggish and easy , like sleep that starts in the ankles and seeps upward . He checked it with a kind of tourniquet at the knee . Sleep begins : In the shins : Upward seep : Mind at neap : I 'm asleep  --  The rhyme startled him with pleasure . The mind floats from a word to an idea , then back to some associated word , which in turn signals a new thought and another kindred word  --  that wonderful saying ofColeridge about the streamy nature of association  --  how staggeredS . T. C. would have been by the insect music of America  --  Insect fiddlers that forebode the frost , Dan said happily , laying his ear among the grassroots to listen  --  Sounds like the last line of a sonnet  --  A cornfield hosanna  --  a rhyme for Susquehanna ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by lazy men . He sat up , scratched straws from his beard , sat in comfortable slump . He was feeling his way back into America . Colors of earth , shapes of trees , touch of air , tone of voices , every sense was different , and he reveled in his perception of the change . Down toward the creek was a grove of huge tulip and chestnut trees ; some of them with storm-scarred limbs . American woodsp179look so much more ragged and impulsive , he thought ; more vehement somehow , more emphatic , more beset . He could hear shouts from the swimming-hole . Time for Jeff to come out . He strolled over the ridge of the field , the boys saw him comingand three naked figures , one black and two white , scrambled across the soggy meadow to meet him . " I felt like the Westernland as I came over the hill , " Dan said . " Grasshoppers jumping up under my bow like spray . " Jeff visualized the picture with a polite smile , but he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he panted , " they forgot to put salt in it . There 's crawfishes , big as prawns . " " Ah 'll make real spray for you ! " cried Mutual . He and Teackle sped back to a waterside stump to show off their diving . Jeff , who could not really swim yet , watched enviously . " I like to see Mutual dive , " he said , " the bottoms of his feet are white . " " He 's much livelier here than he is in that cupboard under the stairs . " " That 's only profession , workin ' that ole fan , " Mutual agreed . " Anything goes round and round the same way is naturalsleepy . " " Better get your clothes on , " said Uncle Dan . " I think they 're going to have tea in the garden . " " Cheese it , Mutual , " said Teackle , " if the Major 's going to have tea outdoors you better hustle and sweep that sod . If he finds it all littered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumps is tan already , " said Mutual , bending in impudentillustration . " Got frenzy in mah feet , watch me bu'n up dat grass . " He leaped into his faded overalls and streaked off uphill . It was Aunt Bee 's first experience of tea in tall glasses with ice . In first experience of so many phenomena all at once she was content to watch and listen as they sat on the lawn ( sweptp180just in time ) near the sun-dial . The baby , Serena Lavinia , looked whiter and more scalloped with lace than any child she had ever seen , but perhaps it was by contrast with the black mammy who carried her out and set her on a blanket for the admiration of the elders . Dan had heard rumors about this famouschild , but had never seen her before . Her father lifted her up for an exhibition dandle and remarked proudly that she was solid . " I declare she weighs as much as Dr. Johnson 's Dictionary , " he said . " I am afraid the Major feels about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old books , " said Mrs. Warren , " something to take down from the shelf and show off now and then , just for curiosity . " " And no wonder , at my age , " said the Major . " Confound it , I think it 's remarkable . And to propagate a woman-child too ; that seems to me to suggest the recuperative splendor of the human race . You 're quite right , Beuly , infants of this age should be on display only so long as they 're amusing . " Serena retaliated by clutching his neat Confederate goatee , and he replaced her on all fours with an appropriate pat on her center of suavity . The child estimated the available resources of fresh admiration and crawled over to make friends with Aunt Bee . " Do n't let her be a nuisance , " said Beulah Warren . " Dat honeychile , she sure thrive on attentions , " beamed the Negro nurse . " The Warren womenfolks always been spoiled , " the Major admitted . " Seems like they make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallclothes . " " Major , you hush yo ' mouth , " said Mrs. Warren amiably , dropping into the family dialect which Aunt Bee found so puzzling . " Maybe I do n't mean cynosure , I mean sinecure . " Siesta and a slug of rum in his iced tea had made the Major specially genial . " It 's what they call Suthren chivalry , Miz Bee . We putp181the ladies on a pedestal until they likely to take sunstroke . Admiration'slike juleps . Breakfast time you do n't want to hear of ' em again , but come sundown you start to hanker . " With the alertness of a watchful host he could see that this Dixie talk was bewildering to Miss Barton . " Push Baby Trundle away , " he said , and reached under his chair . " I 've got a surprisefor you . Here 's the famous Album . " " You brought it outdoors ? " exclaimed Mrs. Warren . " Gracious , do n't spill anything on it . Usually he keeps it locked up in the safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be on the drawing-room desk but a terrible thing happened , we had a wild Western poet staying here , he was lecturing at the University , and he wrote in the book without being asked . After that the Major always keeps it hidden . " The Major carefully removed glasses of tea and the decanter of rum , jam pots , sandwiches and other hazards . He spread a napkin on the iron table and laid the faded green and gold volume open to the sun . " I thought the old book would like a breath of fresh air . I do n't suppose it 's been outdoors since Grasmere , if then . " Affectionately he turned over pages of elderly hairline script . " You see , Miss Bee , Hartley Coleridge gave it to Tullius Teackle , my father , way back in ' 35 . Those were the great days of albums . " " Bee 's a connoisseur of albums and scrapbooks , " said Dan . " She has one of her own that she studies more than she ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show her inward light : she remained placid , but a peculiar ghost of distant things seemed to rise to her from the handwritten pages . Uncle Dan pointed to importantfamiliar names but these were not what impressed her . The sloping gray curve of the Thorofare was in mirage before her ; a familiar dark green door just beyond the bend ; an iron knocker and the polished brass letter-slot  --  the Family Knock , the door opening to the dearly remembered vista , a passageway of shadow , and geraniums and sunlight in the back kitchen.  | " Do you mind if I smell it ? " she said . " Good for you , " the Major assented . " That 's what I always do . " " It smells just like those fresh-water poets , " said Uncle Dan , " a little musty . " He did not really mean this , he was just excited . " I think it 's Dorothy Wordsworth 's homemade paste that savors so queer , " said Mrs. Warren . Aunt Bee bent her face to the pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She used too much flour , " she said . " Or else she was in a hurry and did n't stir out the lumps . Unlessyou mix well it gets mouldy . " " Dorothy was always in a hurry , " said the Major , " but God , Ma'am , you 're right smart to deduce that from the smell of her stickum . They had a wonderful time fixing up this album for the young American . Is yours the same kind of thing ? If all your Wilford Wits wrote in it , it must be quite a collection ? " " Oh , no , mine 's quite different , " she said . " Mine is n't an Album at all , it 's a Commonplace Book . " " Magnificent ! " cried the Major . " Most girls of your generationdo n't know the difference . " Aunt Bee sat up very straight and drank some iced tea ( which she did n't like ) to conceal her pleasure . " Of co'se technically this is n't quite an Album @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Poor Tullius Teackle was so grieved not to be able to pay his respects to old Sam and some of the others , Uncle Hartley got Miss Dorothy to paste in a lot of scraps they had . But do n't you love Hartley 's dedication ? What I like about it is he marks his triple rhyme with a bracket , the way they always did . " He read the lines aloud : " When this fair volume , like an honour 'd fane , Or holy tomb of Saint , or Martyr slainIn Truth 's defense , or virgin void of stain , With gems of verse from many a region brought Shall gleam effulgent with untainted thought ,  |p183Then  my wild words , that like bewilder 'd chimes Limp into tune , and stumble upon rhymesMay prompt some voice in tones acute to ask To whom was given , or who usurp 'd the task To set , ' mid other Bards ' melodious strains , This product of his own fantastic brains ?

" asked Aunt Bee . " Is that the same as Cabinet Pudding ? " " That 's a cute guess , " said the Major . " No , statesman was a Lakers ' word for the farmers or dalesmen , people who had their own small estates . " " It 's what we call Shepherd 's Pie , " said Aunt Bee , looking at the recipe . " Daddy Wordsworth played a low trick on Tullius Teackle , " said the Major . " He used to tell me how the old man sat down and spouted him a poem right out of his head , and then years later we found it in one of his books . He was a bit of an old fraud by that time . What a great poet he 'd have been if he died at the age of thirty . Poor Tullius Teackle , he was an idolater . He was terribly disappointed when they took him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hillside near Kirkstone Pass . My poor Governor tagged along with old Daddy thinking he was going to hear some literature . The old fellow sat down on a rock and studied the landscape long enough to trail some pretty good clouds of glory , but all he did was rumble up gingerbeer and then say , Do n't forget about those railway shares . ' " " He must have been a dreadful old man , and you 're another , " said Mrs. Warren . Even Baby Trundle on the rug gurgled a little and they wiped off her bubbles with a napkin.  | " Uncle Hartley said Dorothy should n't have used Sam Coleridge 's recipe for ginger beer . It was sure to be too gassy . " " Perhaps he forgot the tartar emetic ? " Uncle Dan felt that perhaps Aunt Bee was not showing the Album its due reverence . " I dare say Hartley was really the best of the lot , " he said . " I wonder where the boys are ? " asked Mrs. Warren . " Their tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Aunt Bee . Uncle Dan realized from this touch of irony that his sister was beginning to feel at home . " Likely they do n't care for any tea , " said the Major . " I suspectthey 're off somewhere smoking co'nsilk cigarettes . I reckon young Geoffrey might as well learn his deviltry now as later . You 're right , Sir , about Hartley . Sometimes I think he was the finest gentleman I ever knew , except maybe Robert E. Lee . Did I ever tell you I took a message to General Lee one time ? We did n't exactly meet on sociable terms because he was on horseback and I was in the slough . He was so much concerned about that message he did n't even look at me , but I stroked Traveler 's nose . I calculate Traveler could read , too , because he tried to bite me . " There was a yell of laughter from behind the hedge and the two boys burst upon them . " Why did you stroke the traveler on the nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the Major . " How long have you rascals been eavesdropping ? " " Fruit cake ! " Teackle exclaimed . " With frosting ! " " Plum cake ! " said Geoffrey . " With icing ! " " We 've been getting an education , " said Teackle through a mouthful . " It does n't seem to have done you much good , " said his mother . " Do n't turn your back on the guests . " " I beg your pardon , Ma'am , " said Teackle politely , " but if everybody sits in a circle , how can I help it ? "  | " You better make up your minds are you laughing or eating cake , " said the Major . " Keep away from that Album . " " Teackle said you told him the best way to get educated was to listen to grown-ups talking , " cried Geoffrey , wriggling with glee . " We listened carefully . " " It sounded like a lot of darned old nonsense , " said Teackle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughter , and they were dismissed just in time . " I was afraid Teackle would be a bad influence , " said Mrs. Warren . " He 's just like his father , if anything strikes him comicalhe loses all sense of decency . " " On the contrary , " said the Major , " I think it 's a great tributeto my theory of education by accident . It 's the first time anything I 've said ever made any impression . I was telling him that Uncle Hartley said the best education he ever got was listening to those poets talking . " " About railway shares , " said Mrs. Warren . The Major winked at Uncle Dan . " No , he was remembering afternoons at Southey 's house in Keswick . They 'd all turn up there for a good meal , then poor old Southey would retire to his study to work , while the rest of them sat out in the garden and cut the pages of his books with butter knives . " " I always like black currant jelly better because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonson , when he was ill and taking his meals in bed . He said he tried to lick it off but it still left a stain . " " You 're making me very nervous about the Album , " said Aunt Bee . She carefully brushed cake crumbs away from it . " I think Dorothy Wordsworth 's recipe for pudding is more touching than most of the poetry , " said Mrs. Warren . " And so many interesting autographs . It 's hard to realize famous people sit down and do handwriting like anyone else . " Bee was turning the pages . " Here 's one that looks familiar , " she exclaimed . " Why , it 's Dan's. "  | " Sure enough , " said the Major . " That 's why I brought it out . We 're very proud of it . Read it aloud . " But Bee was too shy , and she could see at a glance that the lines would trouble her . Major Warren , unconsciously waving time with his cigar , read out in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AN ANGLO-AMERICAN SONNETWe cross the ocean from the well-loved land Whose glory makes her meanest son feel great To this vast future , even now elateWith vast achievement : this united band Of States , each with uplifted youthful hand To grapple human ills and mend our fate .

Souls refreshed arise From earnest art and literary loreAnd chivalry . Hence larger sympathiesAnd lives more beautiful for evermore . " Signed by D. BARTON , Greenaway , 1893 , " continued the Major , who had delivered the lines with such gravity that his own eyes felt hot . " Yes , Sir , a very handsome sentiment ; it would have tickled old Hartley . If you ladies give us leave , I 'll put the book back in the house , and I want to show Dan something out in the paddock . You remember that spirited little mare Dido ? She 's coming with foal ; she was joined in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Aeolus . " " I wish you did n't have to go , " said the Major as they waited at the little Greenaway station for the evening train . " Will it be Pa or Ma ? " asked Geoffrey . " It 'll be Ma on her way home , " said the Major . " They don'tp187think it 's wise for her to stay out all night . Teackle , show Geoffreyhow we flag the train . It 's too bad this is the only way to get back to town , I was just beginning to feel communicative . Sometimes I think we should start our breakfasts at midnight . That 's when elderly people like me begin to get loquacious . " " Like De Quincey , " said Uncle Dan . " When they gave him a dinner party , one of Christopher North 's noctes ambrosianae , they timed it so the dessert would come on about 3 A.M. because that was when the Opium Eater 's conversation began to flourish . By the way , Major , I noticed in the Apery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , I should say so , " said the Major , " Tullius Teackle destroyed that volume . He said no gentleman would have it in his library , all the unmannerly things De Quincey wrote about the Lake Poets . I give you my word , Sir , that story about old Parson Coleridge and the shirt-tail was a humiliation to Uncle Hartley all his life . Of co'se I laugh like a fool when I think about it , but as Mrs. Warren has told you , I 'm not a gentleman in the old-fashioned sense . " " What was funny about the shirt-tail ? " asked Teackle , but just then Ma blew for the forest curve and her headlight dazzleddown the track . Geoffrey was lively with notions on the way home . " What happens to a sun-dial at night ? " But Uncle Dan and Aunt Bee were in a meditative mood . It was never urgent to answer Jeff 's inquiries , he could always find another one . " They did n't have any apostle spoons , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brer Rabbit on the spoons ? " " That 's what they call a crest , " said Uncle Dan . " You see the name Warren has something to do with rabbits . Probably in the beginning Major Warren 's family took care of the King 's rabbits , what they used to call a warrener . " " He did n't take care of them very well . There was a dog biting the rabbit . I saw it on the ladle. "  |p188There  was silence for a while as Ma rumbled down the valley , but Geoffrey was still reviewing the observations of the day . " I claimed most of Greenaway for Jeff land , " he said . " I think there 'd be room enough to put it in that new state I invented , the one called Westernland . I could do like Washington , D. C. , and make it a district , the District of Greenaway . " " You can write a nice long letter to the aunts in Wilford and tell them all about it , " said Aunt Bee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The slave quarters , they 're full of bad ventilation . Mutual showed me where one of his fathers lived . They use it now to smoke hams . Why did Mutual carry a rabbit 's foot in his pocket ? Was he one of the warreners ? " " It sounds to me you got a young catechism on your hands , " remarked an amused stranger from the seat behind them . " I can answer that one , Bud . In the old times when the slaves ran away and hid out in the woods they used to throw the dogs off the scent by rubbing fresh rabbit on their feet . That 's why they superstition rabbit 's foot means luck . " Geoffrey pondered this . " It was n't very lucky for the rabbit , " he said . The long and many-colored strangeness of the day was now enclosing Geoffrey in secrecies of his own . After all the world is too rich for continuous comment . Draughts of air like warm milk sprinkled with soot rippled his sailor blouse as he tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gigantic shapes of freight cars on the Northern Central sidings , men with lanternsin the dark , a large gauze-winged locust , big as a Wilford wren , squashed in the corner of the sill ( not even his fingernailscould unglue it ) and as they slowed into the city the humble exhalation of Jones 's Falls . " When you used to talk about Jones 's Falls , " said Aunt Bee sadly , " I imagined something like Niagara . Come , Geoffrey ,  |p189this  is where we get out  --  Geoffrey ! Do n't tell me you 've gone to sleep hanging out of the window . " But Geoffrey was n't asleep , he was thinking that rabbits have a hard time . " Is George Fox the same as Brer Fox ? " he asked . Aunt Bee was weary and perhaps a little cross . " Certainly not , " she replied , hauling him down the aisle . " I think I shall write to Aunt Blanche , " said Geoffrey . He made just one more remark as he was pushed into bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pumpkin  --  I mean punkin . Teackle told me about jack-o ' - lanterns . I think Americanshave some very good ideas . " It was a long walk from 1910 down to Mr. Bolton 's school . " In Jeffland , " Jeff said one morning at the breakfast table , " boys get to school without walking . There 's a kind of dirgable balloonpicks them up and takes them there in the twinkling of an eye . It works with pedals like a Columbia bicycle , a hundred and twenty-five plunks . " Not Uncle Dan , not even Aunt Bee , could properly gloss this tightly condensed statement . It was said in the early days before Jeff and Skinny had learned to walk down to school together for mutual defense . The direct route to Bolton 's led past P.S. 16 , whose hostile tribes gathered in great numbers just at the time when the President of Jeffland was on his way . Was it the still-enduring K-boots that annoyed them ? was it the Wilford Norfolk jacket ( with the Eton collars which Aunt Bee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink cheeks of East Anglia ? Not even imaginingthose tribes as Indians , Boers or Spaniards softened the humiliation of their onset . Sometimes the traveler took a long detour ( thinking that at least the added mileage would wear down the soles of K ) but even so , at some apparently peacefulp190corner rose the shrill two-fingered whistle , the patter of pursuingfeet ( so lightly , swiftly shod ) , the mocking hateful cry , " Ya-a-y , English ! C'm on , kids . " Stones or snowballs filled the air , and even flight was vain . Evidently to Spike McMechan and his gang of " Mount Royals " there seemed something peculiarly offensive about the bare knees of Jeffland or the drizzling brown eyes of LaGrange . Unconsciously the roving Mount Royals carried on the ancient traditions of Chesapeake hooligans . They were only once thoroughly routed . Aunt Bee was shopping at the North Avenue market when she saw Jeff and Skinny , unarmed , chivvied to despair by a group with hockey sticks . Rushing forth with umbrella and a head of cabbage , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiercely with the other weapon . The enemy dispersed in shocked amazement . Even her Quaker conscience never reproached Aunt Bee for this militarism ; what startled her most was that the widowed mother of the smitten McMechan called on her later and thanked her for what she had done . Perhaps this was one of Jeff 's first realizations of rich social irony : he and Skinny were persecuted in the outside world for being mollycoddles ; and reproached at home for being rough . If one were morbid to analyze grievance in its private multiplesone might report the episode of the lunch box . Rulers of imaginary countries are keenly sensitive to carry the particular model of equipment fashionable in their own era . No matter how beautifully Aunt Bee packed a lunch in wrapping paper , the sturdy package was an embarrassment . So after many pleadingsand suggestions the collapsible lunch box was acquired , a folding case of plaid-pattern tin . It gave a faintly metallic taste to the strongest pickles or peanut butter ; after recess it was folded flat and fitted easily into the bundle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President came home without it . " I lost it , " was his only explanation . That was a lie , but like any gallant falsehood it was worth sticking to . Only by watching thep191Mount Royals of P.S. 16 at their lunch would the fate of the tartan box have been known . Everything looked terribly big in those days . A citizen of I Class ( so it was always written ) , the lowest grade at Mr. Bolton 's , would notice it specially in the black-stockinged legs of schoolmates thundering upstairs in the changes from room to room . The tough Shawbuck brothers , for instance : how bulging and muscular their balustrade calves looked in the tight breeches of that time . A President or a Rajah took only small consolationin the existence of the primary department , pitiful Lilliputianswhose existence was ignored ; they carried on a dwarfish career in a room of their own presided upon ( humiliation indeed ! ) by women ; their shrill voices were overheard in unison chanting , the walls of their classroom embellished with pictures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color . They might as well have been girls . But on the stairs of the main school or on the pebbly playgroundbeside the gym were larger creatures of atrocious vigor : voices that suddenly slipped from shrill to bass , and even swarthy cheeks overdue for the razor . The marble ( striped , or milky agate ) sped with brio from those hard and grimy thumbs , the football spiraled off the saddle of the foot with the tight boom that means mastery . The Shawbucks had a catcher 's mask and mitt of their own ; they were a battery in themselves and made signals . If the spectators were young enough Bill Shawbuck could throw a perceptible curve . It thudded into the hollow of the mitt , and admiring whisper said , " Gee , an Out Drop ! " If such powerful persons occasionally faltered in class , prudent small fry did not too quickly raise the responsive hand . There were even more Olympian profiles on higher levels , giants of V and VI who got off early for track practice . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school colors on their white running pants . Strange diagrams left on blackboards showed that Mr. Bolton was harrying them for ap192far-off mystery called College Entrance . One was even seen in the candy store on Cardinal Street smoking a pipe  --  and entered for the Interscholastic pole vault too . What a pity , Jeff thought , there was no system of fagging as in Tom Brown : it would be glorious to run errands for such heroes . But these were of another world entirely . Though wise as anyone is likely to be ( within the limit of individual wisdom ) even Aunt Bee could not guess all the overtonesof that remark about the dirgable balloon . Uncle Dan sidestepped the allusion to the costly Columbia bicycle ( advertisedin Puck every week ) by explaining the adjective dirigible . It did n't take long for the correction to travel from Jeff to Skinny . " Not dirgable , you chump ; it 's dirigible ; means you can steer it . " It was nice , Bee thought , that uncle and nephew set off for work together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five mornings a week , but really he enjoyed it . In the clarity of the early hour it was satisfying to walk a few easy blocks arrangingin mind the familiar , sometimes too familiar , precis of the lecture which docile nymphs will take down in ill-favored script . Their unquestioning minds would receive as gospel such lucid simplification of literature 's complex woe . God forgive the teacher ( poor Uncle Dan would mumble in his safety valves ) who thinks to triumph in ( a ) and ( b ) and ( c ) over the blood stream and anguish of art . And thinking so he would hear Aunt Bee on the steps of morning marble : " Now hold up your heads , both of you . " She smiled with a Thorofare grimness to see her two children set off down Carroll Street with chin on breast . But Uncle Dan was rehearsing English VIII , Jeff perhaps plottinga new detour to avoid P.S. i 6 . As they approached North Avenue Jeff would say , " Are you thinking of your lecture ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the end of convoy . And Uncle Dan , concerned with the problems of an ideal community which had ceased to exist even in fancy one hundredp193years before , turned back to the classrooms of Patapsco and deliveredthe Republic of Jefliand , an ideal community in being , to the wolves of Today . The only salvage Jeff ever brought home from various scuffleswith Spike McMechan and his gang was a copy of a textbookHistory of the United States . Frenzied by the loss of the tartan lunch box Jeff grabbed whatever he could in retaliation and carried the book home with him . Uncle Dan was mystified when he discovered it , bearing the rubber stamp City of Chesapeake , Property of the Board of Education . In idle curiosity he began to read . He soon realized that the young hoodlums of North Avenue were hardly to be blamed for their instinctive suspicion of Geoffrey if by any chance they regarded him as the successor of the British invaders to whom so many crimes were attributed . He understood now what lay behind the boy 's remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American His-tory . " " Why so ? " Uncle Dan asked . " It 's extremely interesting . " " Yes , but the redcoats are always brutal , and the boys take it out on me . If the English got licked so many times before it seems too bad it has to be done all over again . Now the kids have invented a game called Hissing the Hessians . They make a noise like snakes . " Uncle Dan supposed that maybe these ancient sneers existed only in the reading allotted to the public schools , but he found the same trend in the history used at Mr. Bolton 's . The tale was further enlivened by vigorous woodcuts illustrating the unerringmarksmanship of the farmers at Concord , or the invaders ' bombs bursting in air at Fort McHenry but always falling clumsilyshort . The city of Chesapeake , he had noticed in more ways than one , was imbued with ferocious patriotism , perhaps partly due to a certain uneasiness in its own breast for having been on both sides at once in the War Between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit to find within a few blocks ofp194each other on the same boulevard ( but fortunately looking different ways ) imposing monuments in honor of both North and South . These two statues perhaps canceled each other in the all-seeing eye , but Jeff 's favorite was left over . This was the white marble edification below which the poet is tossing on concretebillows in a concrete dinghy , and a boatman rests on concreteoars to admire the composition of the anthem . This compositionso fascinated Jeff that he once climbed the thwart and wrote with pencil on the empty scroll , " Oh , say can you see . . . . " It was generous of the boy to be so keen about this monument since the legend of Fort McHenry had cost him much pain . Uncle Dan pondered this matter from time to time . It seemed a pity to foster in a new generation , even a new century , these partisan memories of ancient ill . One evening the rugged Mr. Bolton himself came to pay a call and asked Professor Barton if he were satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Dan an opportunity to raise the question in his mind . Mr. Bolton 's own subjects were mathematics and science and he confessed himself honestly surprised at the jingo tone of the approved historians . He promised to remember the suggestionin choosing textbooks for the ensuing year but pointed out that much more power was exerted in the public schools where the enrollment was a hundred times larger . This accounted for Uncle Dan 's innocent pilgrimage some time later to call on the Board of Education . With Spike McMechan 's grimy volume as marked evidence he passed among the impressivegraphs and charts with which school superintendents adorn their corridors and found himself courteously received . A young man was sitting with the educator , and seemed so interested in their discussion that he begged permission to stay . Uncle Dan , always disarmed by politeness , assumed that the other visitor was also a teacher and spoke with unguarded candor . Even the most careful professional acquaintance with Spectator or Rambler or the pamphlets of Dilly and Dodsley does not necessarily pre/pare one for the humors of modern journalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Barton representedonly himself and not any large contingent of taxpayers , evaded the issue with noncommittal ease ; but the young man happened to be a reporter . The shock was like sickness when unsuspecting Uncle Dan opened the next day 's afternoon paper : REDCOATS NOT ALL BRUTAL SAYS PATAPSCO PROF ENGLISH TEACHER RESENTS SLURS ON BRITAIN CALLS NORTH AVENUE BOYS TRIBE OF BOERSHis ten-year-old nephew Jeff ( who used to spell it Geoff ) has to fight Lexington , Concord , Yorktown and Fort McHenry all over again , to say nothing of Spion Kop , says Associate Prof. Daniel Barton of the English department at Patapsco . The Prof attributes the troubles of young Jeff , bright-faced English laddie , to the crude prejudice with which American schoolbooks are written . As a specialist in the literature of the eighteenth century Prof. Barton believes that American textbooks are unfair to the Tories of 1776 , and that sometimes even the embattledfarmers did not draw a perfect bead . " Why throw good blood after bad ? " asked the Prof , registering a dignified complaint yesterday at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to me we are setting the children 's teeth on edge even unto the third and fourth generation . The Boers are bad enough in South Africa without setting up a lager on North Avenue . " Prof. Barton was speaking with British humor , and was not alluding to North Avenue 's excellent beerstubes . He bids us reread Edwin Burke and says a great deal of unnecessary ill-feeling is caused by the textbook industry perpetuating shallow views . Prof. Barton is a mild-manneredQuaker , but his eyes flashed with indignation as he insisted it ought not to be necessary for a boy to fight his way to school with brass knuckles . He showed a numberof marked pages in Wainscott 's History of the United States alleged to indicate undue severity toward the regi/ments of George III . Mr. P. J. Guldensuppe , local managerof the Middle Atlantic Book Company , says , " We have distributed over a million copies of Wainscott 's History in the state of Maryland and no one has ever protestedbefore . Chesapeake University is the acknowledged headquarters of American historical scholarship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the faculty of the larger institution . " Scholars have long memories , it is difficult for them to realize the swift evaporation of newspaper fumes . Even the cheerful young reporter who thought this just one more amusing story in a day 's work , an unexpected windfall worth half a column of space , would have been genuinely dismayed to realize how much suffering it caused . But like many unmerited or casual sorrows it brought certain blessings in aftermath . It is true that Dr. Friedeck chuckled when he read it , but there were others , including the Superintendent , who resented the jocularity . The absurd and painful incident roused some lovers of fair play ; it helped Dan , later , to recognize the true character of the Town itself , home of music and learning and kind manners . " In the city of Chihuahua " ( pronounced by the reader in five syllables ) , " for the most part built of mud . . . overtopped by bald , porphyritic mountains . . . some score of objects . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Aunt Bee repressed an inward qualm . In fair play , she had to . The understandingwas that if Geoff read aloud a chapter from some book chosen by her , he could follow it by a selection of his own . " Is there very much like that ? " she asked . " Aw , doggone it , that 's only the first page . " She resigned herself to the ordeal . Captain Mayne Reid seemed to her much more painful than anything by Thomas Hardy ; but the volume bore the bookplate of the Friends ' First/Day School Library and had evidently been thumbed by many young Quakers . The reader was not even dismayed by various ejaculations in Spanish : unconsciously he rose with clenched fist and caballero pride shouting , " Gringo ! Alto el sombrero ! " ImperfectCastilian was covered by the vigor of the performance . Even while trying not to pay attention to the text Aunt Bee could not help glancing at the boy 's excited face . Extraordinary , she thought to herself ; if he had a tomahawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lifelike . She allowed the ferocities of Mayne Reid to flow past her , keeping her mind in its own stronghold . The Cozy Corner in the front bedroom upstairs was her fortress . Sitting there she could see the life of Carroll Street reflected in the duplex mirror ( outside the window frame ) which Dan had thought would be entertainment for her . Actually in that corner by the hot-air register she was more likely to think back to the Thorofare . Over the settee she had hung the old Wilford photographs  --  a family picnic in the Meadow , a view of the River with Harry Bredfield waving from the cockpit of the Scandal , and Geoff 's cherished picture of Miss Debbidge with her arm round the neck of a stone deer . The old sewing cabinet was there , rosewoodmarquetry now crumbling under the hot blast of the register . The ivory darning egg was there and the old ebony muffin-stand  --  whichshould have been downstairs but it got cracked in the hold of the Westernland . It was useful on those private occasions when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea . There were moments of nostalgia when only a cup of very strong tea in Thorofare china and a slice of buttered bread cut platonically thin would serve as anaesthetic . But Graham bread was no substitute for Hovis , and the hundreds and thousands , if attainable at all , were so much bigger that Uncle Dan called them tens and hundreds . She came back from reverie to perceive that Geoffrey was breaking the rules . " That 's not fair , " she said . " You 've started another chapter . "  | " Aw gee , just one paragraph . It 's slick . . . . The young Kentuckian was half frenzied by the insult , the proud blood of his Republican citizenship was boiling within his veins . ' " Aunt Bee reflected that a few pages of Mayne Reid had quite canceled the benefit of the previous reading , which was Cranford . She was always amazed by these sudden transformations . She would overhear a voice in the street which she scarcely recognized as her nephew 's . Then came the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strapful of books flung down , and up the back stairs came forceful dialogue cozening refreshment from the colored cook in unblemished Uncle Remus . Reading Cranfordhe reverted to what she called the Queen 's English ; if the book he chose for his turn was his own favorite Three Men in a Boat he produced from somewhere a counter-jumper cockney . If Hiawatha , he gave her as appetizer a supposedly Indian ululationcreated by patting a mouthful of wailing vowels . Now Mayne Reid had put him back into the dialect of Bolton 's . " Is the book all about scalps ? " asked Aunt Bee . " By the way , when you happen to take a bath , please wash your ears . " " Wait till you get to Chapter 9 , that 's something fierce , a spectacle of fiendish spite . ' Those Indians are mighty ornery . " He closed the book with a satisfying snap and glanced at the outside mirror . " Cheezit , here comes Do-re-mi Beamish . Aw gee , 23 for her . " " Geoffrey , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't always precede it by Aw gee . ' I 'd really prefer it if you 'd be honestly blasphemous and say Oh God . ' " Jeff was shocked and hastened to continue , " Has she got to take tea with the nobility ? She 'll be mad because I did n't do my practice . Get the hook , it ai n't my turn anyhow , it 's Uncle Dan 's . " He rushed from the room , slid swiftly down the banistersand before Aunt Bee had verified the image in the busybodyshe heard the simple chords of Dorothy , Old English Dance beaten lustily on the piano below . Miss Beamish , a simple soul from the Music Department atp199Patapsco , had been one of Aunt Bee 's stratagems . Disturbed by violent renditions of Bill Bailey , Wo n't You Please Come Home ? or Goodbye Dolly Gray , Aunt Bee considered that piano lessons and a few traditional melodies of the nursery might have softening effect . Geoffrey was dour about this until , to his surprise , Uncle Dan volunteered to take lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play the piano , and the boy was stimulated by this unexpected rivalry . It had its embarrassments , though , for instance when President and Mrs. Beinbrink , of Patapsco College , arrived unexpectedly while Uncle Dan was conscientiously doing his exercises . The Professor of English felt sheepish at being discovered by his employer pounding with heavy fingers at The Spider and the Fly and The North Wind Doth Blow . He hastily called Geoffrey to take the piano stool , but when Mrs. Beinbrink said , " I was so glad to hear your little boy practising his tunes , " Geoffrey could not control himself . " I ca n't tell a lie , that was Uncle Dan . You should hear him do The Happy Farmer , it 's fierce . " Except on the keyboard Miss Beamish 's resources were meagerand Geoffrey had never forgotten her guileless inquiry when she first came to tea : " Are you related to the nobility ? " But though naive , Miss Beamish was persevering . Jeff startled Aunt Bee by exclaiming , " She 's like Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the last galoot 's ashore . " One problem of scholarship is that the research student rarely finds a table large enough for his needs . Sometimes , late at night , when the little desk upstairs was littered with college work , Uncle Dan brought his special studies down to the diningroom . The secret dream  --  the work on Susquehanna and other utopian communities in America  --  involved much allusion and cross-reference . The dining-room table , he pretended , was the best place to spread out , but perhaps its neighborhood to thep200icebox in the pantry ( Aunt Bee still called it the larder ) had influence too . In an ancient threadbare dressing-gown , beard kinked sideways where he had leaned chin on fist over piles of sophomore scribble , he laid out his mosaic of learned patchwork with no less happiness than a Rajah of LaGrange mapping new provinces . Consecutively assorted were the heavy tomes toted from libraries , the indexed clippings and scraps of notes , the box of file cards ( America 's chief contribution to scholarship , he sometimes thought ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his Codex , his master-text , all quotations from Coleridge were marked in red , from Wordsworth in green ; De Quincey was purple , Hazlitt yellow , Keats a heavenlyblue ; Dan had his own logical spectrum in these matters . He strolled several times round the table , looking askance at Wordsworth or Southey ; or maybe shoved Hazlitt to a more commanding position . It was spring , the sudden violent April of Chesapeake when the oyster yields to the soft-shell crab and even frugal Aunt Bee had brought home an armful of daffodils from market . She was shocked when the colored maid Moxie called them " buttercups . " Wordsworth himself , Dan mused , would have been shocked by the tragic swiftness of a middle Atlantic spring ; even at Greenaway the daffodils were shriveled in a few days by untimely heat and drought . Was that one of the oddities of the American temper , such haste in all transitions ? Dan was thinking of a different kind of soft and gradual opening ; the Great Spring of 1797 , where in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all clear in his imagination . He saw a queer-looking young fellow run down a lane of honeysuckle in the dusk , vault a gate and hurry across a field to shorten the way . That was at Racedown , in Dorset  --  Racedown , just what the young pilgrim did  --  and honeysuckle too : he on honeydew hath fed  --  for the young man running was Sam Coleridge , on his way to meet William and Dorothy Wordsworth . Even William , the human metronome , was young then . That was the beginning of the Susquehanna dream ; and evenp201the beginning of a new kind of poetry . How easy it is to see Beginnings if you 're far enough away . Sam and William skipped like minnows in a Turning Tide , he thought ; with Dorothy for the perfect audience . He lit his pipe and sat down to the manuscript . About the second paragraph the tobacco went out and he realized he was hungry . One of his bachelor discoveries had been that great American triumph , condensed milk . Aunt Bee was suspicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can for his midnight snack . Cocoa made with condensed milk , with heels of stale bread cut into strips and dipped were his simple weakness . Scattered brown splashes on papers or dressing-gown testified his peaceful absorption . It was not a scene to please esthetes , but few studentshave come closer to the cloudland of Kubla than Uncle Dan in those innocent sittings . " At least it 's better than laudanum , " he said when reproved . But like laudanum his milk of paradise led to slumber . He was more than half asleep , and at the same time doubting if he was doing justice to Dorothy , when Aunt Bee came downstairs in a mood of concern . It must be a really disturbing anxiety before Bee broke in upon her brother 's meditations . There was probably a little consciousselfishness in the way he had encouraged her to believe his periods of musing were always of delicate import . There were moments of mere idleness when , assisted by his beard , he could assume an air of introspect which Bee took to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you thinking ? " He was too honorable to lie , but he used a kind of grunt that implied it . This time however he was caught ; he woke with a start and spilled some cocoa . " I thought you were Dorothy Wordsworth , " he said . " I do n't believe you were thinking at all . " She mopped up the puddle with a sheet of blotting paper . " There was so much noise in the breadbox it woke me up . " " It must have been mice . "  | " Happen it was a two-legged mouse . " " They ought to make breadboxes that do n't have so much echo . " " Then I looked for my scissors to do some sewing . I see you 've got them down here . " " I borrowed them from Jeff . He had them to cut out sol-diers . " " A woman ca n't sleep until she knows her scissors have come home . Now you 're awake too , you might as well listen to me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe what trouble Coleridge 's father had with his children , " said Dan vaguely . " I 've got a note about it here somewhere . People in ideal communities always did , I dessay . What about Jeff ? I do n't see anything wrong ? " " You do n't notice , you 're not here when he comes home from school . You would n't know it 's the same boy . Why , he even talks a different language , he and Bert Eutaw come in the back way from the alley and bother Moxie for something to eat , they hang round the yard and sing those terrible songs about Coon , Coon , Coon , and Bill Bailey , I 'm afraid she 'll give notice . Then there 's that gang of Oriole Boys from round the corner , you know they have some sort of feud with Jeff and his friends . They swarmed over the fence to try to steal the piano box for a bonfire . They had it half out of the yard and then Jeff and Bert gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alley and the first thing you know there was a pitched battle . If it had n't been for Moxie running out with a broom and the huckster drove down the alley just about then and took a hand , I do n't know what would have happened . I ca n't understand what 's become of the boy , he 's a perfect little hoodlum . Is it those funny pictures that he reads in the paper on Sunday , or what ? The parents of these other boys seem to be pleasant enough people but their children go rowdying every night . After all , you 're a college professor and Jeff goes to that ex/pensive school and I thought he was going to grow up like a gentleman . " Dan was surprised by this unusually long speech from Aunt Bee , but it had given him time to rally . With the timid prudence of the philosopher he would not admit that he had been worriedby similar thoughts ; he took refuge in a side issue . " Moxie knows the boys do n't mean anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderfully . I was amused the other day when I overheard them in the kitchen . When he discovered she does n't know how to read he decided to take her in hand and what do you think he was doing , he was reading Uncle Remus aloud to her . I heard him say that I do n't read it properly and he was getting her to pronounce things for him the way Uncle Remus would . You know , that 's real scholarship . " " But he 's such a little tough . There must be some decent boys at Mr. Bolton 's school but when he comes home he talks like a bargee . I do n't like to bother you about such things but sometimes I wonder if you know what 's going on . Because you teach in a college for girls you think everybody is as gentle and sweet as they are . I 'm afraid you only see Jeff when he 's on his good behavior . " Dan 's habitual grunt had a little more groan in it that time . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of surface tensions . He stifled the obvious retort that Aunt Bee only saw his students at their most demure when they were invited to Sunday tea . " Listen , Bee , " he said , " maybe you do n't realize what the boy has been up against the past two years . It 's our fault , too . When we got here we tried to keep him a nice little English boy , he went to that dame-school until he was ready for Bolton 's , then all of a sudden we threw him into a big American school . You ca n't run with tigers unless you wear stripes , and the first thing he had to do was to learn to be like everyone else . Otherwise they 'd tear him to bits . You remember how that gang down on Joppa Street used to lay for him when he was on hisp204way to school . Remember the time he said it 's lucky he only had two eyes because you ca n't get more than two of them black . When they were both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor kid , it 's worse than Mowgli learning to live with the wolves , and I think it 's wonderful how he 's developed his own hide and horns . Wolves do n't have horns but you know what I mean . I think it 's fine for a while if he gets completely swamped in America . When the time comes he 'll react against it his own way . " " He 's swamped all right , " said Bee , and the very tread of her feet as she returned upstairs was definite with indignation . " That 's the most American-sounding thing I ever heard Bee say , " Dan thought . Looking over his array of notes he realized perhaps clearer than ever that none of the problems of ideal Susquehanna had yet been solved . God help the artist , he thought , who must forever be in his surroundings but never of them . If for an instant he succumbs to acceptance his vision is forfeit ; and yet how cunningly he must seem to agree . On an already crowded slip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing as he did so that he would n't remember later what at this moment he perfectly understood . Let 's go to bed , he said , and the " ' s " meant both himself and Coleridge . J. William Sprunt , Choice Quality Meats , would have been surprised to know that his name had been borrowed for an importantsettlement in the western prairies of Jeffland . Sprunt City was the leading beef market of the pioneer province Westernland , which looked in imagination rather like something from Mayne Reid ; it was the center of a Staked Plain , which Jeff interpreted as the place the steak comes from . Mr. Sprunt , who had spent his whole life in old Lexington Market , might well have carried an endorsement on his signboard : " By Special Warrant , Purveyor to the President of Jeffland. "  |p205Going  downtown to market with Aunt Bee became a joyous tradition . As a dog capers with anticipation when the leash comes out of the closet , so when Jeff saw the string-bag hanging on the newel-post he knew it meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain " brawn " or " silverside " for the butcher on North Avenue , and that merchant 's distress when she called his chopped hamburger " cat 's meat , " Aunt Bee learned from Mrs. Warren of the famous old market downtown . The place was as truly in character for Chesapeake as the Peabody Institute or the Pimlico Track . Here an aristocracy of good digestion shopped for its victuals , choosing shad or birds or berries as a bibliophile would scrutinize first editions . Distinguishedgourmets , followed by colored men carrying loaded baskets , chaffered from stall to stall ; groups gathered in the crowded passages for sociable chat as at a court levee . Conversationsoverheard might range from crab gumbo to the Kneisel Quartet . " Please behave yourself on the tram , " Aunt Bee said to Geof ti frey as they waited for the trolley on Patapsco Street . She said this to divert him from alluding to her first ride on that line , when she had taken the car on the wrong side and went far afield into the country . Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything comes to him who waits If he waits in a place that 's meet , But never wait for a downtown car On the uptown side of the street . " His own form of misbehavior in street-cars was not intentional bad manners , as he tried to explain . When Aunt Bee saw an angry flush rising on the countenance of a stout lady across the aisle she shrewdly traced it back to Jeff , and saw with dismay that he was accurately reproducing on his own features the unconsciousfrown and pout of the opposite passenger . Aunt Bee nudged him fiercely . " It 's bad enough to stare , " she reproached him later , " but it 's worse to imitate . "  | " But why did she do that with her face ? " he asked . " I ca n't tell what people feel like unless I do the same thing . " " Do n't bother so much what other people feel like . You attend to yourself . " " It 's a habit of mine , " said Geoffrey . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for things . There was a nice little colored boy in the car the other day . He looked like the tar-baby but he was crying . Skinny Granger was with me and he started to cry too , he 's very sensitive , but we could n't understand why the colored boy was crying until we saw there was a boy across the car sticking out his tongue at him . So I stuck out my tongue at Skinny to give him an excuse . Why did that other boy stick out his tongue ? " " It was very cruel and saucy of him , " said Aunt Bee . " If it was because the boy was black , it must have taught him a lesson , because the colored boy 's tears were perfectly white . Everybody 's tears are . If we walk up Terrapin Street to market I can save the transfers . Star Lanvale gives me a very good rate of exchange for transfers  --  he collects them . For five of them I can borrow his Youth 's Companion overnight . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to experiment with the facial misfortunes of street-car passengers . Aunt Bee gave him the traditional warning : " You know if you should sneeze while your face is all screwed up , it will stay that way . " Jeff produced a loud hopeful snort , but found his features still plastic . Then they reached the windows of the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company , across from the market . Here the scarlet coffee grinders and lithographedcalendars were effectual change of attention . Aunt Bee used to say that the meat stall of J. William Sprunt was her best training school in American life . Though her purchaseswere small he never minded explaining the different cuts of meat , illustrating them on a large hanging carcass with the steel from his belt as a pointer . Like butchers on the Thorofare Mr. Sprunt had very pink cheeks with a violet threadwork ofp207veins , and wore a straw hat all the year round . " Perhaps it 's because his face is so hot , " said Geoffrey ; " he thinks it 's still summer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involve the use of the saw ; the thumping chopper was almost too sudden for comfortable watching . But most of the time at that counter he stood in solemn study of Mr. Sprunt 's signboard . It was a large painting of a steer 's head , hung above the steelyard scales . " If you stare so long at that ox 's head , " said Aunt Bee , " you 'll get to look like it . " " I can almost see the horns coming out on your forehead , " said Mr. Sprunt . Jeff scuffed his feet in the sawdust in pleased embarrassment . But it was not so much the Front de Boeuf mask that charmed him as a suggestion of broad grazing landscape the artist had sketched as background . It had exactly the feeling and color of Henty and Kirk Munroe and Mayne Reid . A green prairie fading into blue highlands was dotted with beeves ; small figures of cowboys rode pintos and twirled lariats . One might naturally suppose it was a panorama of Mr. Sprunt 's home . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pampas and champaigns , but there was something bright and quick in Mr. Sprunt 's bantam eye which discouraged too much catechism . Geoffrey had a shrewd habit of getting someone else to ask any question which might sound foolish . So when Skinny came along , also marketing under tuition , Jeff persuaded his friend to inquire . " I think Mr. Sprunt has a picture of his ranch in the West , " he explained . " I bet it 's the Texas panhandle , what they call pampas and champaigns . But Aunt Bee says I must n't ask him any more questions , you do it . Here , use my handkerchief first , it 's cleaner . " Skinny , among the sharp smells and savors of the market , always wept happily , but so damp a face naturally enlisted Mr. Sprunt 's sympathy . He put aside the long knife he wasp208whetting , thinking perhaps this had caused alarm . " Yes , my boy , is anything wrong ? " Skinny prudently attributed his question to still another source . The way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to know if you live on champagne ? " Mr. Sprunt was startled into laughter , but wondered afterward . " No , Sonny , " he said warily , " meat ai n't quite as high as that , in spite of the Beef Trust .  --  A couple of Peck 's bad boys , " he said cheerfully to Aunt Bee . " Yes , Ma'am , over here we call it headcheese , but I remember my old gramp called it brawn . " While Mrs. Granger and Aunt Bee did their shopping Skinny and Jeff wandered among the various stocks and smells . Skinny was not above capitalizing the peculiarity of his tear ducts . A stroll among the fish and cheeses gave him a look of pathos which could be useful if they then hung about a candy or bakery stall . But even Skinny grew weary of alms and as they waited outside the A &; P he confessed his impatience . " I 'm too proud to go on getting things by crying . It 's undignified . I think we better earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't enough for a Rajah . LaGrange has got to have a sinking fund . " " I get twenty-four , " said the President . " That 's because it 's a shilling , equals twenty-four cents . " " I 've got an idea , " said the Rajah . " If you 'll split your four extra cents with me every week , I 'll tell it to you . " " Maybe I 've got an idea , " said the President . " I 'll be genteel . I 'll mention it without charging you anything . I heard Major Warren say he would have to let people paint Mandrake Pills on his barn if he got any worse hard-up . " " But we have n't got a barn to paint it on . " " We could paint it on boards like those sandwich men and carry them around the street every Saturday . Then we send a bill to Mr. Mandrake . " " It is n't Mr. Mandrake . It 's Mr. Schenk . You have n't been+ygfll in America long enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the blood and that 's only in the country . People in cities have doctors to go to and besides if they 're impure they 're too stuck up to admit it . " " We could sell some of the pills to J. William Sprunt . His blood is just raging in his cheeks . " " My idea is better , " Skinny insisted , " besides I 've given you half of all my tear-duct dividends . " " I know how I can get a dividend . Aunt Bee said she 'd give me a nickel extra if I 'd stop reading Hiawatha to her . She says it puts her to sleep because it tells everything twice . It 's fun to read , though . " " Shucks , that would be only chicken feed . What I 'm thinking of would be real money . " " Cross your heart ? " " I 'll bet you a chocolate mouse . We 'll each buy one , if there 's a penny in them you can have it . " The chocolate mice were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of hygiene . They were disapproved by Aunt Bee not only for themselves but for the display of Nick Carter booklets which adjoined them . The chocolate was only a thin wash of syrup and the inwards could not compare , Aunt Bee said , with Bessie Barritt 's cocoanut ice . But two or three in every layer had copper cents imbedded . Accordingly Jeff and Skinny regarded these confections as a form of investment . They could n't do that in England , Geoffrey remarked , because their pennies are too big . But Aunt Bee and Mrs. Granger took charge of the boys before the mice could be bought . " Meet me at the clubhouse tomorrow morning , " said Skinny as he was commandeered . " I 'll tell you my idea then . We 'll have to let Bert and Star in on it . " " There 'd be more profits if it 's just us , " Jeff suggested . Skinny made a final twist under his mother 's grasp , sniveling with his great idea . " They 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 've got the equipment .  --  Hell 's bells , Mother ! Dop210I have to have a new overcoat ? If it has a velvet collar it makes my neck feel like camphor ice and I ca n't stop crying . " Customers on the crowded pavement outside the A &; P probablythought Skinny 's mother was very cruel to him . " The tiger 's roar filled the cave with thunder  --  Hurrp ! " Uncle Dan 's bearded face really did look almost tigerish as he opened the door and growled this morning cry . Hurrp was a word of their own which compacted the sense of " Hurry up " into more urgent sound . The tiger 's roar of course was quoted from the picture in The Jungle Book . And as Geoffrey liked to think , his sleeping place really was a kind of cave : the small cubicle between Aunt Bee 's bedroom and Uncle Dan 's . Its real name was the box-room ; Jeff 's cot was surrounded by trunks and bags still plastered with their ocean labels . This interior space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to be properly realistic in the morning summons Uncle Dan should have crawled on the roof . Jeff was usually awake sooner , the hurrp meant that the bathroom was now free . He could tell by the sounds of plumbing and footsteps when the moment drew near for the tiger 's roar . It was perfectedplotting to go deep below blankets and wait . " You were so still under there I thought you had smothered , " said Uncle Dan . " I was expecting , " Jeff said . Expecting was best under a tattoo of rain , though bright mornings had their pleasure too when a swath of light lay over the roof without damaging the soft dimness of the cave . From downstairs came the mixed voices ( one shrill , one mumble ) of Aunt Bee and Maxie discussing the rations of the day . This was usually followed by the squeak of Aunt Bee 's slate pencil as she made notes for her orders . She was careful not to rub out the cat ( supposed to be Jue ) drawn by Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , would frighten away the slate-mouse which made such painful screaking . " Hurrp ! " Uncle Dan repeated . " I envy you a room with ap211skylight . It 's like having your mind open at the top . Did you ever think of that ? " " I think of all sorts of things . I like your window too . You can see people 's bath-water going down the gutter . " " That is n't very interesting , is it ? " " You can tell whether they 've used soap . " " If you 're going to have that club meeting you 'll have to hurry , because Aunt Bee says you must n't miss First Day School . " This meeting of the club was unusually orderly , probably becausethe members were geared for religious duty and partly throttled by starched linen . Bert even had a standing collar whose points gored the underside of his chin . Mrs. Eutaw thought this the only way to encourage a cherub look of upward attention in church , but Bert had found a way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rallied on his gruesomelooks he explained , " It 's my Sunday collar . " " My family do n't believe in Sunday , " said Jeff unguardedly . " We call it First Day . " " First Day is n't as religious as Sunday , " said Star with contempt . " You 'll go to hell , you poor little squirt . " " Yay , yay , yay  --  old First Day , " said Bert , hoping to start a rhythmical blasphemy , but it got lost around his Adam 's apple . Skinny , who had summoned the meeting , was very businesslike . " Listen , we 've got important business . Jeff and I decided we 've simply got to earn an income , it 's shameful to be so impenurious , and we 'll let you fellows in on it because you 've got the rolling stock . What do you suppose is the greatest monopolypeople want ? " He sneezed with hay fever and excitement ; the earnestness of his streaming features compelled the other members to discussion . Ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were offered , but he swept them all aside . " It 's a drink of water . You know how it is in this old pest/ridden town . Everybody has to boil their water because it 's full of malaria . You ought to know , Bert , your father is a physician and surgeon , and what 's the result ? You have to keep old kettlesof water boiling on the stove all day long and when you do get a drink , it 's most likely tepid because you ca n't put ice in it , the ice is an epidemic too , and over on the other side of town the kids live in luxury because they 're out every evening to that spring in the park and sell bottles of water . " " Geez , baby , that 's a smart idea , " exclaimed Star . " We could get up early and go across the bridge to Druid Hill spring and bring back a load of bottles . I bet people round here would rather buy water from their own children instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You 've got a big express wagon , " said Skinny , " and here in Bert 's barn is a lot of old glass jars I saw lying around . That 's what made me think of it . " " I do n't know about those jugs , " said Bert . " They had all kinds of coal oil and carbolical acid in them . My father is crazy about emetics , but we could give them a scrub . " " The smell would soon wash out , " said Jeff . " Nobody would be expecting to taste it , so they would n't notice , only maybe the first few pioneers ? We 'd keep it in our own personal families until the bottles got good and clean . " In this way the T.S.O. 4 Artisan Water Company was founded . Star Lanvale had n't used the express wagon much , partly because his sisters had pre-empted it for giving their dolls an airing , also because he felt obscurely that the inscription Dandy Racer was too juvenile . But now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water Company there was even a rivalry ( at first ) who should pull . No commercial enterprise was ever founded without quickly meeting the unexpected . By Euclidthe shortest route to Cotton Duck Bridge and the springP213was the obvious diagonal across the Vacant Lot , but until they tried it with a freight of glass bottles they had n't realized how rough was the terrain . There was frequent discussion among the promoters whether it was better to take the longer way up CarrollStreet and then along Division Road than the Oregon Trail across wilderness . Scholarly Skinny nicknamed the bumpy diagonalthe Hypotenuse and said it was a useful lesson in plane geometry . To which Jeff , captious as usual , replied , " Yebbut it 's not a plane . " Paradise for boys is any region on the outskirts of town where civilization has not yet reached full control . That big spread of undeveloped ground had all the prime factors of charm . It was bounded on the west by steep slides of tawny gravel under which ran the line of the Ma and Pa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavors of the creek were frequently invigorated by dead kittens or squirrels . Ma and Pa had defendedthemselves by a strong barrier , to buttress off a constantlyslipping talus of rocks , tin cans and various jetsam , but there were ways of getting through the fence for exploration . Sometimes , if the chocolate mice had been fertile , pennies were laid on the rails but Bert Eutaw advised Jeff against trying it with an English coin . He said it would throw Ma off the track . The central expanse of this small prairie had been successfully parceled out in tenure by various gangs who occasionally met in a level patch in the middle for any sport then seasonable ; the outward fringes , well thicketed with brambles and sassafras and hay-fever carriers , were accepted as open to squatters ' claim by rival clubs . The T.S.O. 4 were not numerous or warlike enough to acquire one of the more desirable gullies , or even the bubblingmarshy sump called Pogeypond . This was thrillingly rumoredto be a quicksand , filled with bones of orphans from a near-by asylum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the western scarp had great advantage for the heaving of missiles . These were thrown more as experiments in ballistics than as volleys of malice . It was probably accidental when Star Lanvale P214hurled a rotten apple clear across the stream and smote a brakemanon a box-car of the Northern Central . ( No one ever threw things at the Ma and Pa , that was too much like picking on a weakling . ) The impact was superb , the apple burst on the trainman'sjowl , and a scouting vedette of the powerful Oriole Boys was impressed . A formal invitation was issued to the T.S.O. 4 to join forces with the Orioles , who coveted such a marksman . The T.S.O. 4 declined , which caused them much harrying by the other tribe . The vacant lot , as Jeff afterward meditated , had considerable sociological value . It served as a general Gehenna for that whole neighborhood , and as the city of Chesapeake was in those days not meticulous in the disposal of rubbish , householders along Carroll and its rear neighbor Schier Street dumped into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an education in life 's rich complex to find such miscellaneous trove  --  anything from broken baby carriages to bed-pans . Skinny was particularly pleased when he found an old eye-cup , sooted by fire ; Jeff suggested that it was intended for black eyes but Skinny put it to good use as a drinking cup for humming birds . Jeff , still innocentof the extraordinary American passion for throwing things away , remarked , " Everybody round here must be very rich if they can waste things like that . " He mentioned this theory to Aunt Bee who had also been astounded at the relics of previous tenants found in their backyard . It was very different from Wilford'sfrugal habit . She quoted a remark made by one of their neighbors when they first moved in . Mrs. Magothy , the attentivehousewife at 1908 , had been assessing the new-come Bartonsin the usual way by study of their backdoor doings . Mrs. Magothy was overheard ( and quoted ) : " I do n't think they 're really consequential , they have such skinny garbage . " " Best compliment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeff nicknamed the watchful neighbor Mrs. Maggots . He was distressed when they found the ripely defunct corpse of a cat in Sassafras House , the Club 's wildwood sanctum . It P215could n't have happened if Aunt Emma were here , he thought . Even Uncle Dan occasionally took an observant stroll round these playgrounds and was astonished by the profusion of waste . " If this country ever really gets hard up , " he said to Major Warren , " it will certainly hurt . " Such reflections were not more than subconscious in the hopefulmerchants of the T.S.O. 4 Artisan Water Company as they plotted their sales campaign . They had not realized that the spring of fair water across the bridge was considered private property by the boys of that other region . The first time the T.S.O. 4 made the journey with fresh-painted wagon and diligentlypurified containers , they were startled to find the wellheadsurrounded by a whole company of toughs ( so they promptly classified them ) with wagons and bottles of their own . These experienced water carriers looked formidable and lusty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bright wagon down a steep grade the quartet came to the hollow where the drinking fountain was niched in the hillside . All four were intent on their task : one to guide , one to hold back from behind , one on each side to keep the precious bottles from joggling . In their pride and concentration they did not notice the threatening silence of the boys already gathered round the iron water-pipe . Skinny , always alert for psychic vibrations , was first to look up . " Aw gee , " he muttered , " there 's the Shawbuck boys . " I 'm glad there 's four of us , he added to himself . " Well , for Deity 's sake , " remarked Bill Shawbuck , the noisier but perhaps less dangerous of the two Shawbucks . " Who do you-all think you are with your nice new cart ? " The T.S.O. 4 artisans now realized how deplorably shiny and young their delivery wagon looked by comparison with the battered vehicles and home-made scooters of the others . It was queer because all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been thinking how splendid and big it was . Bill and Jack Shawbuck took lounging attitudes on each side P216of the rusty iron standpipe , leaning elbows on its rounded top . They were so evidently in command of the situation that the rest of the crowd , respectfully waiting until the Shawbucks finished their bottle-filling , began to express what was evidently power politics . " Ai n't you kids got any hydrants your own side of town ? " sneered one objectionable dwarf with crossed green eyes . " We 'll take our turn , " said Jeff politely . " Gee , I guess this spring belongs to Druid Hill Park , do n't it ? " said Star . " I guess everybody has their rights in a public park . " " Old Francis Scott Lanvale , the Star-Spangled Banana ! " cried the offensive Bill , as though addressing the sky at large . There was a threatening jostle around the basin as the forces in occupation shifted to positions of vantage . The half-dozen express wagons and home-made scooters already gathered at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the after-school time about 4 o'clock when familysupplies of drinking water were replenished . On some of these new arrivals Jeff noticed scrawled in chalk  --  how different from their own careful paintwork  --  the menacing legend MOUNT ROYALS . Excursions of this dangerous tribe , which dominated the heights of Park Avenue and Mount Royal Terrace , had spread even across the valley of Jones 's Falls ; Spike McMechan was their satrap at P.S. 16 . Jeff nudged Star who was at the handle of the wagon . " I guess it 's not urgent , " he said to Bill , who still seemed to be gazing anywhere but at them . " Oh , it 's not urgent ? " declaimed Master Shawbuck . " You hear that , Jelly ? It 's not urgent ! " How unfortunate , Star ( a bit of a diplomat ) was thinking , that in moments of stress Jeff unconsciously adopted such formaljargon . " Come on , kids , " he whispered , " we 'll back up till they get through . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " announced anothersycophant , moving outward as if to flank a retreat .  |p217Geoffrey  still could not believe that even such uncongenial schoolmates as the Shawbucks would be so intentionally disagreeableon this distant ground . It was a shock to find that their hostile manners , constantly exhibited in the hallways and playground at Bolton 's , were carried even into the outside world . He met the penetrating gaze of Jack Shawbuck and unconsciously adopted the stuck-up tone for which he was infamous . " I think you 're extremely unreasonable , " he piped . " We 'll wait till you and Jellybean get through , " squeaked Skinny . One hopes and believes that in after years Master J. J. Shawbuckencountered his due share of humanity 's woe ; but in that epoch he had his own secret annoyance , the family and respectedmiddle name Jellaby . Its conversion to Jellybean was j obvious , but reserved for intimates . Trebled out in poor Skinny 's liquid snivel it was peculiarly humiliating . He conned the field steadily , with a special eye for Star Lanvale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the preliminary parley , shrewdly toning up J. Jellaby Shawbuck for the kill . " Guess this T.S.O. 4 Water Company must be ole friends , " said Bill . " Must be some mistake . I did n't know what StarSpangledBanana and Baby Granger and kids would be doing over this side of the tracks . " Jellybean made a sudden rush . The T.S.O. 4 Company were already backing away so their pride was somewhat salvaged , but the gesture of ferocity was emphatic enough . He seized Jeff 's arm , twisted it violently backward and scoured his nape with a stone which no one had seen him pick up . The nimble Star sprang to reprisal and the ecstatic yell " Fight ! Fight ! " rose in many voices . But the Park policeman who always prudentlystrolled through the hollow just about that hour quieted the fracas . He was surrounded by a clamor of repartee , and the T.S.O. 4 Company , rather sadly considering these unexpected problems of industry , waited patiently on the outskirts until all P218squadrons of the Mount Royals had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found it possible to approach the fountain . They had supposed that one or at most two members would be enough to take the job in turns . But surrounded by unfriendly watchers all four were needed : one to hold the water handle open , one to fill the bottles , and a guard on either side to watch for any movement of malice . It was already growing dusk when they completed their load . They realized now how desirable would be an arrangement of pigeon-holes to keep the jugs from dangerousvibration , and also how much heavier was the return . As they heaved uphill toward the bridge Bert called attention to sounds of argument and distress on the other side of the glen . There was the crash of breaking bottles accompanied by profane yells and retorts . " Gosh , " remarked Skinny , " those Mount Royals are terrible muckers . They 're fighting among themselves now . " " Unh-unh , " grunted Star , tugging at the load . " I know what 's wrong . While they were all yapping at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skinny found that by making the trip to the spring before breakfast the problem of meeting enemies was avoided . The delivery wagon of the water company rumbled cheerfully up the pavement by the vacant lot , past the Chestnut Woods on Division Road , and over the echoing planks of Cotton Duck Bridge . In bright morning air the two rulers found much to discuss . Jeff explained that because he slept in the box-room he could not get out without passing through either Aunt Bee 's room or Uncle Dan 's . " It 's like an uncle and aunt sandwich , " he said , " but if I have to wake up one of them it 's better to be Uncle Dan because Aunt Bee is most likely saying her prayers . She must know a lot of prayers , she gets up so early . " The topic of religion was appealing to Skinny . Jeff 's allusions to First Day School and Friends ' Meeting had roused his P219curiosity . " My father 's very liberal , he 's a Unitarian . He says it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meeting some Sunday . He says the Friends have the root of the idea in them . " " Maybe that 's why Aunt Bee is so crazy about root beer , " said Jeff . " She got a lot of ole extracts and condiments and made a whole vintage but it exploded . There 's a piece of bottle stickingin one of the beams . I 'm going to start a museum in the cellar , Relics of the Great Carroll Street Explosion . Do you think people would pay ? " " Nothing ever happens in my house that would be worth making a museum about , " said Skinny sadly . " That 's because it 's full of girls . I do n't know why , but my Dad says Unitarian ministers always beget girls . " " I thought Unitarians were pastors , " said Jeff . " I always read the notice boards on the churches . I do n't think it 's really Holy Ghost unless they have a sexton . " " Pastors is Baptists and Lutherans , I think . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congregation around like sheep . " " At Friends ' Meeting we have caretakers , they do n't go in for sextons . They have one on board ship , though , " he remembered . " Captain Bompjes had one to tell him where he was . " " You 've got to have sextons or people wo n't know what to do when you die . Sextons have to see there 's smelling salts ready in case people feel sick at the funeral . " " Shucks , people do n't carry on like that when Quakers die , " said Jeff . " My father preached at a funeral where three ladies fainted , but he said he did n't really take the credit for it . It was very oppressive weather . " " Did you know colored people have churches too ? Moxie told me , she goes to African Methodist , they have a black bishop . " Skinny looked about to make sure he was not overheard . " I P220bet you something , if you do n't tell on me . I bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . So there . " Since they were being so frank , Jeff felt he could even venturea question suggested by dreadful rumors in school . " Do Jewish people believe in God ? " " Aw gee , sure they do . My father says everybody believes in God , but he says Jehovah ran them so ragged in the Kingdomof Israel they got sort of panicky about the whole thing . My father 's terribly outspoken , he even had a priest and a rabbi at the house to dinner one night . I was scared to say anything . I guess it was n't real dinner , just a kind of bouffe . We had fishcakes.  --  You know they used to burn Unitarians for being so outspoken , " he added with pride . " They put lots of ole Quakers in prison , " Jeff countered . " That was because they would n't go to church , but you do n't have to have churches . Aunt Bee says ole George Fox found God in a hollow tree . It sounds like Brer Buzzard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have n't decided what sort of religion they have in LaGrange , " admitted the Rajah . " Of course they have Christmas , it 's good for piety . Candy canes could be a gov'ment monopoly . They have a bang-up Sociable on Christmas , and nobody has to sing We Three Kings of Orient Are . " Skinny and two other young victims had once been swathed in robes and turbans and made to pull a cardboard camel which collapsed on them . The experience still rankled . " Star of wonder , star of night , " hummed Jeff . " Star with royal beauty bright . Westward leading , still proceeding . I rather like that song , I like those little short lines , they sound good some way . " " Field and fountain , moor and mountain , " mimicked Skinnyin falsetto . " We better get on , those toughs will be ahead of us . " The wagon clinked faster , each artisan pursued his privatethought for a space . Morning sunlight on the load of glassbottles faintly reminded Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a window overhead ; Miss Debbidgeamong , the breakables . Are human errands always among such fragile things ? Skinny presently remarked , " You do n't know how lucky you are on Sundays . You have n't got a crowd of grabbing sisters . You can read the funny paper all to your-self . " " Do Unitarians have a Spring Sociable ? " " You bet . Gee whiz , we have Interdenomination Picnic , every sex invited . My father hires the old steamer Louise and we go down to Tolchester Beach . Listen , if you let me go to meetingat your church I 'll get you a bid to the picnic at Tolchester . They have a toy steam train down there runs on a track round the field . It 's an engine about the size of this wagon and each car just big enough for one person to sit . The kids all raise Cain on the steamer . They play Monkey , monkey , bottle o ' beer ; honest , you 'd never know they 're a Sunday School . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Aunt Bee says she hopes you do n't want to go to Friends ' Meeting just for curiosity . You have to sit awful still and there 's no music and hullabalooto take the load off your mind . Uncle Dan does n't go very much any more because he got to thinking out his lectures in the Silence and he forgot where he was and said some ideas out loud . I guess it 's pretty hard for a lecturing teacher ever to keep quiet . The elders spoke to him about it and he was sore . " " Gosh , you got elders ? It 's like the Bible . That must be real religion . " Warily they looked down into the hollow to see that no Mount Royals were at the spring . " Going to the well , that 's kind of biblical too , " said Jeff . " Nobody there . All quiet along the Potomac . " " I 'm sorry about that stain , " said Aunt Bee , " but if you will leave the map and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . I mopped it up as fast as I could but I 'm afraid it made a smear on the map . " " There 's no harm done , " said Jeff , using one of Uncle Dan 's favorite phrases . " It made a very interesting shape so I drew round it and founded a sort of Reservation specially for you . It 's called Privacy . ' " Aunt Bee did not exactly smile but her mouth loosened slightly . She had her knees on a doormat in the backyard , turningthe earth around her tulip bulbs with the big carving fork . Uncle Dan and Jeff had long intended to get her some garden tools for her birthday but she said the digging was an excellent way to polish the fork . Moxie had no gift for keeping things clean according to Bee 's standards and did not even understand what knife-powder was , as they learned when she sprinkled it in a salad . " Presents have a way of going wrong in this family , " Jeff remarked . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was unlucky for him his birthday came just at the beginning of the football season . " Conversation between Jeff and Aunt Bee was syncopated in a way that made it mostly unintelligible to others . Even Mrs. Magothy , who cocked a dirigible ear at the window sill next door , would not have guessed that the new parish of Privacy was named on her account and that just outside its boundary was the eavesdropping village of Old Maggots . Aunt Bee dislikedChesapeake 's cheerful habit of sociability at front stoop and back fence . She hankered for a small patch of open air to herself , and in her first attempts to start a few flowers in the yard she was constantly irritated by the critical gaze of Mrs. Magothy . One could almost feel the tremor of the neighbor 's loosely hinged lips shaping for comment . " You can imagine a balloon coming out of her mouth like the funny pictures , " said Jeff . But it was better now since Aunt Bee had tacked a roof of chicken wire over the brick walk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woods . Her first experimentin planting had to be quickly removed . " That was a good joke on you , " said Jeff , " planting that poison ivy . I guess there 's a lot of stuff grows at Wilford that does n't flourish here . " He was thinking of the clumps of primroseroots the aunts had sent over by post . They soon expired in the hot and shallow earth of Carroll Street , which seemed underlaid a few inches down by a subsoil of rusty cans . Uncle Dan thought the previous tenants must have had a Tin Wedding . " I must write to Wilford , " said Aunt Bee . " I 've been putting it off too long . You ought to do it too . " " I 've been putting it off because things need so much explaining . Doggone it , they just would n't understand . " " It 's very difficult , " said Aunt Bee . " When you try to think of two countries at the same time , you ca n't be fair to either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a little jaunt round Jeffland when I feel depressed . It 's very jolly . You can put things down on the map the way they like to be . " No , it was not easy , Bee reflected , as she got out thin notepaperto write to the Thorofare . From the beginning she had transmitted so simplified a picture that she could hardly begin now to suggest its more grotesque phases . For instance the aroma of what Geoffrey called " Lion Steak " which just then dominated even the vapors of Jones 's Falls . Jeff said it gave him an appetite , but Bee felt otherwise . It would be too gruesometo describe how the old tinder-box skating rink on North Avenue , converted into a menagerie , had burned down one stormy night . All sorts of beasts from elephants to midget ponies had perished in flame and panic , and the T.S.O. 4 were morbidly interested by the sight and whiff of charred lions in the tragic embers . Jeff had rather too vividly described how the iron bars of the cages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At this very moment Mrs. Magothy and many other pairs of roving eyes were alert for escaped monkeys supposed to be at large , and scouting parties of Orioles and Mount Royals were shrill in vacant lots . So horrifying a story would only agitate the aunts . It was perplexing enough to explain such simple phenomena as Breakfast Food and creamed chipped beef , or the tocsin of the **32;8187;TOOLONG . The first time Bee heard these she hurried out to the alley . " I thought it was an American muffin-man. "  --  Or how would you describe the boys playing lacrosse along the cobbled street ? When she tried to draw a picture of those queer netted implements , Grandma thought it was battledore and shuttlecock . She looked younger as she began to write : MY DEAR MOTHER , I am very ashamed not to have written lately . I wish I could console myself as Dan does , he says he does n't fare to write letters this spring because it 's such a shock to write 1900 instead of 1899 . You can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's really too bad the new century should begin with all this trouble in South Africa , and now we read threateningnews about China ; but Geoff says people called Boxers ca n't be so bad . That was the barber on board the Westernland that took such a fancy to him . Dan thinks that surely now Lord Roberts is in charge things will be better ? I was glad Wilford Meeting drew up a minute questioning the war . I have begun this letter in a confused way but Moxie interrupted me to ask what to do with the crumbs left over from the baked oysters . How I wish we could use the crumbs for treacle tart , but the real treacle simply does n't exist here . We gave a little supper last night for some of the faculty who have been very kind . I served the oysters in those silver-mounted scallop shells you let me bring from home . People are very careful here about only eating oysters in months with an " r " so we wo n't have P225many more this season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patapsco , so very Southern and talks in that drawl as if their teeth did n't meet , and never pronounce the " r , " he was joking about the months for oysters and Dan said , " Of course , Mr. President , in Chesapeake there are no months with an r . ' " I do n't think Dr. Beinbrink really understood poor Dan 's little joke , but Dan is accustomed to that . In our college circle there 's a strong Wesleyan influence , and they do like their jokes to come head-on , not a little bit sideways . We alwaysenjoy overhearing remarks about ourselves . If you think Wilford is a place for gossip you should try a college like Patapsco . Anything said by a faculty wife is all over the " campus " ( three city squares of hideous buildings like the Anker Blocks Geoff had ) . We soon learned that one of our most stolid professorssaid of Dan , " he 's a fine fellow but I do n't think he has any sense of humor ! " But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotion naturally depends on him . It would be fatal if they ever got wind of Dan 's great ambition to have a post at the University . Of course Patapsco is small beer in the world of scholarship compared to Chesapeake University . Really you would be amused to see Dan as a " family man " as he calls it . He says that as a solitary student living in lodgingshe had no idea life could be so complicated . He asks me , " Did these weird things always happen or is it just some fatalityof my own ? " I tell him that probably everything always happens everywhere but he never began to notice until Geoff and I made things interesting for him . As for Geoff , you would n't know him , he 's so big and stout , always bursting his trousers . I dare say he has had more troublesthan he tells about in acclimating himself to other boys . Because his natural way of expressing himself is rather precise and old-fashioned , he adopts an exaggerated toughness and slanginess as a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but after he has been in the house a little while it  |p226wears  off and I get him to read aloud to me as much as possible . He always surprises me because he acts out whatever he reads and sometimes it 's quite thrilling . Dan left The Ancient Mariner lying around and Geoff said he would read me some of it . He said he was interested because it had things written at the side of the page like the Bible ! He asked amusing questionssuch as " Why were the mariners hollow , they were hungry ? " and then he got excited and really , I had quite a chilblainon my spine when he said in a dramatic guilty whisper : " With my crossbow , I shot the albatross ! " For an instant he looked like old Ben at Sutton ferry , or one of the old Seckford almsmen ! Then he burst into tears and I think I would have done so too except for my Wilford training . Perhaps it 's the climate , everything is more emotional over here . You remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hooks . That reminds me , our kind friend Major Warren gave Geoff a book of stories Wild Animals I Have Known . He read me one about " Molly Cottontail " which left us sadly depressed . Geoff said , " I think literature is very cruel to rabbits . " Our little feast last night was really a success , I think . I 've told you about my struggles with Moxie which were partly because  it took me so long to realize not only she ca n't read , but she does n't know right from left . You ca n't believe how difficultit is to explain that to someone who has no idea of it . Mrs. Warren suggested I try her with near and off , being terms of horses , but we finally got it straight because she has some wonderfulgold stoppings on the left side of her mouth , so now we call the left the " gold-tooth side " and she understands . The ladies last night were all excited about the new movement in women 's clubs which are so powerful here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clubs are being started for the betterment of social conditions , &c.,; and they are agog to change their Browning Society into a New Century Club . They say they have " gotten " everything possible out of Browning and he has been dead quite a while . P227They were disputing , when does the twentieth century really begin ? Dan insists not until 1st January 1901 , but that seems to me absurd . I think it 's a mathematical quibble he got from Blanche Bristol ! By the way , one of Dan 's advanced students ( Miss Towson , the one who 's always talking about " poitry " ) let out a secret : this year 's graduating class is going to dedicate its Yearbook to Dan , a great compliment because they only do that to their favorite professor . I 'm trying to write fast . It 'll soon be lunch time . We 're going to have minced kromeskies ( leftovers from last night ) on the old blue Thorofare platter- . I always wash it myself for fear of accident . Dan calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it stays fine Geoff wants us to walk to the tadpole pond in the Park . We will probably have to bring home a jar full of the unfortunatecreatures . Then they turn into frogs and hop round the floor . They have a kind of frogs here in the swamps that make a wonderful whistling music at night . Geoff took me for a walk in the vacant lot to hear them . The stars were very bright and he said such a pretty thing . " They sound so silver and sad and far-away , you 'd think it was the stars and not just frogs . " How is Lizzie Batts ? ' When Geoff has to go to the dentist he always thinks of her . Our dear love to all , G. will add a P.S.BEEP.S . My dear Grandmother &; Aunts : She did not leave much room but I do n't believe in " crossing " letters as people used to . There is plenty of paper in the U.S. , and everything else too . We are doing splendidly and I enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American history . Next week we shall go to an old museum that has a famous painting , Exhuming the First American Mastodon . She is a little aprehensive . It sounds like a terrible fire we had where elephants &; lions were burned , but this is only a historical painting . Aunt Bee said a witty thing about the First American P228Mastodon : " Who was that , George Washington ? " Love to alland Miss Debbidge , your loving JEFF ( Geoffrey ) P.S. 2 . Aunt Bee did n't really say it , I thought of it myself . 44 . Pleasures of the ScholarIn his study at the back of the house Uncle Dan was intent upon the mild pleasures of the scholar . His teaching schedule began early in the mornings  --  he used to say he had grown a beard on account of the 8:3o class  --  but allowed him an hour at home before lunch . He often found it the most fruitful concentration of the day . Time at the meridian seems packed more tight , pressed solid under the hammer strokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alley softened into distance , housewives and colored maids after long forenoon vociferation settled down to duty . A carpenter had put double sash in the window that overlooked the yard . A storm-window was the American name for it ; it kept out the storms of Moxie 's conversations with hucksters . Moxie 's full name was Monocacy ; Jeff reported , " She says she was named for a battle , and she makes as much noise . There 's interesting names in her family , she has a sister called Zouave . She says her ole mammy got run over by a Federal supply train , they got no more morals than a sutler mule . " " Sumpter mule , " Uncle Dan corrected . He reflected how rich language is in these falsifying doubles ; what the Oxford philologers later called pairs and snares . He himself , like all teachers , had some favorite confusables for his students , asking them to distinguish Thomas Lovell Beddoes and Thomas Love Peacock ; or Vivian Grey and Dorian Gray . Zouave was to Jeff a name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sells . The Zouaves were the most vivid of all the cardboard troops , they were dressed in a Turkish fashion and were called upon to make Last Stands .   " They wave their glittering chibouks , " said Skinny , who thought these were cutlasses . Like Chesapeake itself they seemed to have fought on both sides . Uncle Dan kept the double window tight shut , even in warm weather . He liked to contemplate the dusty space between the two panes , imagining invisible sound-waves trapped there , only half strangled and still trying to get at him . His shabby flat desk stood under the window . It was not nearly large enough : he had to be careful not to elbow the kerosene student 's lamp which had a green china shade and a gurgling nickel cylinder . He might have used a gas fixture ( with a Welsbach mantle ) but the kerosene lamp , a relic of his boarding-house era , was the memento of many quiet hours . He believed it helped him to concentrate . Aunt Bee always trimmed and filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence of evening study the lamp made small inward gulps and swallowing sounds , rather like Bee herself . Half a century of Wilford suet , pork and pastry , Dan realized , caused strange convulsion inside . Aunt Bee had brought over a few old family pieces from Wilford , but most of the furniture Dan bought secondhand when he set up his own home on Carroll Street . There is a psychic value in furniture of alien origin ; the old slippery couch against the left wall came from a doctor 's office , and when he lay there after lunch with The Prisoner of Zenda or The First Men in the Moon or Captain Kettle it added to the peace of his nap to think vaguely of painful or embarrassing examinationsthat had probably been conducted on its rigorous horsehair . To the left of the desk was a quavering bamboo stand which had never expected such burdens as his broken volumes of the Edinburgh Review or the half set of De Quincey . The latter he had bought cheap at Cambridge in partnership with a friend : they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers and the other the even ; it grieved him that his researchin De Quincey was based mostly on Volumes 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , ' 0 , 12 , and 14 . Only the faded brown Morris chair at the right  |p230of  the desk was strong enough to carry one volume of the 1755 Dr. Johnson 's Dictionary , borrowed for study from Major Warren . In the right-hand corner and also behind him were unpainted shelves put up by the carpenter . At the foot of the couch was another window which could be opened for ventilationbut was less pleasing for view : it opened directly opposite the corresponding window next door , at some six feet distance across the dividing fence . This was the boudoir of plump Mrs. Magothy who had less than the Barton instinct for concealment . Through this open window came the sounds of bath and dishwaters as they seethed along a brick gutter toward the alley ; and the tinkle of a Japanese windbell , thin strips of flowered glass hung to catch the draught . This was a discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him of S. T. C. 's aeolian harp in the window at Keswick . Another sound that came occasionally across the yards to westward was the whistle of Pa or Ma , winding their way up the valleys toward Susquehanna . He could dimly hear Aunt Bee and Jeff talking together in the yard , but returned his mind to his notes . He was in good form , he had just given his lecture on Hazlitt in English VIII ( History of Criticism ) and the timing had come just right for Hazlitt 's April birthday . He had freshened up the lecture in spots that had grown too familiar , particularly by his happy discovery that Hazlitt applied the phrase " The Fourth Estate " to journalism some years earlier than Carlyle or Macaulay to whom it was usually credited . A note for the Modern LanguageAssociation : he visualized it in the dense type of academicjournals , modestly signed D. Barton , Patapsco College . Vicissitudes of weather had made pleasantly apropos his reference to Hazlitt 's April temperament . Something too of an April look in the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his ewe lamb in the pastures of The RomanticMovement , had given special felicity to his account of the Silver Buckle episode . He reminded the girls that Hazlitt P231as a child had lost a cherished silver shoe-buckle in the sand beaches of Cape Cod . Of all possible souvenirs , he suggested , that forgotten ornament would be the happiest find for the amorist of English prose . " But , Professor , " bleated the adenoidal fatwit in the front row , " it would be all rusty . " The class 's cackle , and the look of admiring sympathy from the ewe lamb , warmed him to peroration . " The rust would be like some students , " he said amiably , " merely superficial . Rust is only a peripheral oxidization caused by exposure to unpropitiouselements . " ( It was for such impromptus that his classes adored him . ) " As in Hazlitt himself , the fine metal is there , under whatever temporary crust caused by change of manners . I like to think of that perished silver buckle as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a symbol of the great critic 's argentine precision ; he was himself a connectinglink , a clasp , a conjunction , between journalism and literature . Even a buckle has a tongue , " he added , pleased with himself . " You took a terrible chance , " said Miss Towson afterward . " When you used the word argentine I 'm sure that girl will believeHazlitt lost the buckle in South America . " " What I wanted to say , and checked myself just in time , was what Hazlitt said to Gifford of the Quarterly : You are a nuisance , and should be abated . ' " They proceeded to discuss the matter of Miss Towson 's thesis for a Master 's degree on Wordsworth as a Writer of Prose . This was giving them both much satisfaction , particularlythe ingenious idea of condensing The Prelude from verse into the more stringent form . With the vapors squeezed out of it the poet 's monologue was becoming a strong essay in luminousprose . They even believed that Miss Towson might find a publisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : To D. B. , Inspiring Teacher . Such compost germinated his mind as he recapitulated the  |p232morning  's work , and unclipped the loose-leaf notebooks to insertany new notions that had occurred to him . Such are the hours that Hazlitt called Living to One 's Self ; they are not easy to find , and worth strong sacrifice . Almost unconsciously he blew a perfect smoke ring  --  which he could not always do by intention  --  and watched it dash itself against the barrier of double glass . Jeff , palavering with Aunt Bee in the yard below , waved to him and made the raised eyes and lip-motions that meant " Are you working ? " Uncle Dan nodded happily . " He says he 's working , " Jeff reported . " That means we must n't catch his eye . " It was the pleasantest kind of work , when Dan felt himself getting ready to think about something but did n't quite know what . He looked across the disorderly view of wood-fenced yards , cobbled alley , the balconied backsides of the houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had nicknamed this region The Backs , with ironical allusion to the velvet lawns on the Cam , behind the colleges at Cambridge . It should be Sheer Street , Jeff said , because it runs along the top of the canyon . " The clotheslines get older on different streets , " Jeff noticed . It was true . Schier Street , Uncle Dan once remarked , was a regular begettery : the garments exposed there ranged from infants ' gear to age about seven . In the yards of Carroll the average would run from ten to twelve ; as one moved to more stately Key Street the wooden pins nipped more elaborate female ruffle and full-length merinos . Eastward of Key the rigging of Patapsco Street showed younger again , the undervests of the college . All these humilities rippled and struggled in the flow of early spring . Ten thousand saw I at a glance , Dan thought , tossing their tails in sprightly dance . He had never truly perceived the humane quality of the city until he became himself a householder . Now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's perfectly hideous , he said to himself : hideous , and homely , and dear . I love it ! Oh , the wondersheen of spring . The word was from a mint of his own . Nothing is so '  |p233comfortable  as to take a foreigner 's word and capture it for one 's self . That is an invasion I enjoy . Wondersheen ! It was n't only The Backs that he had learned to love . Sometimes , in those parenthesis moments before lunch ( when his mind was just feinting for position ) he went out to love the sidewalk in front of the house . He would have been too shy to tell anyone but he thought of the sidewalk as Reality . He did n't dare wash the marble steps ; that had to be done by Moxie ; to do it himself would have declassed him forever on Carroll Street ; but it was all right to get out the hose ( which had no nozzle ) and wash the brick pavement , specially after the coal man had blackened it with dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealer in firewood by paying him to dump the logs outside and let Uncle Dan put on gloves and heave it through the little window into the cellar . The patient log-man ( as Dan collaborated with Shakespeare in calling him ) simply thought that Professor Barton was queer , because he himself would have stacked the wood in the bin for the same money ; but to Uncle Dan it was important . It was one of his few contacts with physical decency . It was a sardonic parable of college education : the teacher ( he mused ) goes out into the forests of literature and cuts down the tall trees , delivers the chopped billets of doctrine for his customers ; all they have to do is pile them orderly in a breathless basement . What do they know , or guess , or care , of the music of wind in the boughs ; the ruinous crash of the great diseased chestnut ; the twangling drone of the saw ( cutting steadily into tough fiber , as language bites its way into meaning ) ; the sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the brow ? What do the young know of anything ? he thought sourly . They just want it deliveredin convenience so they can pile it up and pretend they 've " passed " it . The backyard , maybe , was Hazlitt for Uncle Dan , but the sidewalk was Coleridge . To sweep or sprinkle was allowed a P234legitimate chore of citizenship , and involved more casual conversation with neighbors than he really enjoyed ; but a man with a beard always looks more thoughtful than others and by putting on a look of absence he was able to avert too much salutation . The Carroll Street brick pavement , laid in cunning sideways pattern , often took him to thought of the old wall at the top of the Wilford garden . It was rather like that wall laid flat on the ground ; the walls of Jericho prostrated by divinebugle . A wall that kept no one out . Cooked by Chesapeake sun , scoured by the furious rainstorms , it was never so lovely pink as when the last snow of winter had to be swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow-cleaning in that neighborhood , thought Uncle Dan a tightwad because he liked to do it himself . They could n't possibly know that it was his luxury , his parable of walls fallen flat so he could think about what interested him . As he shoveled and scraped he mumbled to himself , " Twice five miles of fertile ground With walls and towers were girdled round . " Then came spring , scurfy sycamoresswelled in bud , and in the cracks of the pigeontoed bricks sprouted random seeds of the buttonballs , picked open during the winter by civic sparrows . Yes , the brick pavement was Coleridge himself , who had blown all fortresses flat in two terrific trumpet calls , and then had fallen palsied among what Wilford called rubbidge . Why could n't S. T. C. have known , Uncle Dan asked himself as he swept the bricks in ecstasy , why could n't that tormented god have known how his own buttonball skein ( " many an incense-bearing tree " ) would fall , so far and long away , among the careful bricks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the wonderful boy who leaped over the fence and careered across the meadow to meet William and Dorothy  --  No , Dorothy and William  --  he thought of that magical-tragical head : a pleasure dome with caves of ice  --  The first Englishman who ever loved America as she needs to be loved ,  --  " In Xanadu did Uncle Sam " - 1P235must tell that to Major Warren  --  I never saw brick look so rosy  --  a professor of literature ca n't afford to be too fanciful  --  and he was summoned for lunch . It was not always necessary for the T.S.O. 4 Water Companyto visit the spring so early in the morning . Unexpected auxiliary presently reinforced the young merchants . Aunt Bee had been curious about a much larger boy whom she had seen accompanying the expeditions . Her first impression of this oddlookinglad was memorable . The doorbell rang , she went to open , and a tall spotted youth in a very long overcoat removed his cap from a shock of bristly black cowlick , made a low bow and said , " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " There was something so grave and intense in his demeanor that Aunt Bee 's first thought was , it must be some instructor from the college . " I 'm very amenable to your kind acquaintance , Madam , " continued the visitor with portentous solemnity . " The despot 's foot is at your door . I 've been instructed by the supreme councilof unction to deliver this small package as a token of their assiduity . " He again bowed almost to a rectangle and held out a bumpy-looking parcel untidily wrapped in brown paper . " I 'm afraid there must be some mistake , " Aunt Bee began , astonished . " I 'm not expecting  --  . " The package wavering uncertainlybetween them fell to the marble step and burst open , showering the stoop with small pebbles , oyster shells and chestnutburrs . The face of the messenger , bent over toward her in exaggerated humility , suddenly flushed a deep red . His large opaque brown eyes rolled rapidly from side to side . Without a word he turned and fled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over with long arms swinging like a gorilla and throwing his knees very high under the flapping skirts of P236his coat . From concealment behind a neighboring stoop appearedJeff and Bert Eutaw screaming with laughter . " There 's no harm done ! " cried Jeff . Bert Eutaw tried to explain while Jeff picked up the fallen rubbish . " It 's Ingram Sylvester Duffle . He 's not quite all there , but his father sent him to live at my house so he could be around with kids and lead a normal life . " " It does n't look exactly normal , " said Aunt Bee ; she could see an agitated face looking nervously round the corner of the block a hundred feet away . " Just ole nervous spasms , he 'll outgrow it , " said Bert . " And he has such beautiful manners , my mother says he 's really a good example . He 's going to be mighty valuable . He 'll do anything you suggest if you 're quite serious about it . And he 's terribly strong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's much older than we are and he 's only in the fourth grade , but you should see him clean up those Orioles and Mount Royals . He 's got them scared to death and he 's going around with us as a bodyguard . " " He 's like Centurions in the Bible , " said Jeff . " He can throw the biggest kind of rocks and skin right up a tree . When he gets really excited he champs . " " I 've seen him foam if you tease him too far , " said Bert . He whistled and Ingram , like an obedient mastiff , came loping up the sidewalk . Again he made a sweeping bow and gesture to the horrified Miss Barton . " They 're big fiends , they 're big fiends , " he muttered apologetically . " Did I do something wrong ? They told me exactly what to say . " " He has a wonderful retentive memory , " said Jeff . " If you tell him the words , he never forgets . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ring doorbells and make speeches . He holds the maid with his glittering eye . " " Sometimes they slam the door on me before I can make it ' P237glitter , " said Ingram sadly . " It takes practice to make it glitter , you big fiends . " This was evidently his usual description of his companions . " They do n't tell me what they put in the packages , " said Ingram Sylvester Duffle . " They say it 's better to keep my mind on the speech . I can say it again : Is this the eminent Miss Barton ? I 'm certainly amenable to make your kind acquaintance . ' They said that would sound like the age of chivalry . " He fixed her with a gaze of humble imbecility and again mumbled , " The big fiends , the big fiends ! " " We 're digging a trench out in the lot , " said Bert . " If the O.E.A. wagon comes round it will find it full of the bones of the Oriole Boys . Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dig . " " That 's not my name , " said Ingram anxiously . " You call me that it 's not chivalry , it makes me sick to my gorge . " " I hope Dr. Eutaw approves of your treatment , " said Aunt Bee doubtfully to Bert . " He says they 're such normal wholesome boys , " insisted Ingram . " The big fiends . Good morning , Madam . I hope we will meet often . " His small companions took him one by each elbow and escorted him up Carroll Street . Aunt Bee could see him tilting a large red ear downward to attend instruction . It did not take long to exhaust the possibilities of parcel delivery . The ingenuity of carefully wrapped packages of old bananaskins or vacant lot antiques was worth admiration ; so also the labels " To the Lady of the House , Special Delivery from Strauss 's " ( a distinguished department store ) , and Ingram was never deficient in his instructed recitation . It always worked the first time . At a dignified front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startle the Negro maid with his extremeobeisance , and gabble , " Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the Madam . This little trophy is brought you by hand from Strauss 's delicatessen , Forepaugh and Sells , Ringling Brothers and Twenty Mule Team Borax . Please de- P238liver at once or place in your refrigerator , keep away from light and dark , heat and cold , whether this parcel so conceived and so dedicated can survive . " There might be plenty more memorizedtext ( tutored to the messenger with difficult gravity in Sassafras House ) but that was about as much as any dooropenerwould accept without either terror or suspicion . It was not long before various householders kept a broom or an umbrellahandy in the front hall ; one Amazon Irish maid , too often pestered , first heaved a pail of water and then pursued Ingram Sylvester Duffle dangerously near the local police station . The itinerary of the parcel delivery could of course be extended to more distant streets , but like all good mischiefs the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plan a change of tactics . This much explanation is needed to account for what happened when Skinny Granger made his first visit to Friends ' Meeting . Perhaps a sexton with his sharper sense of mortality would have been better prepared ( than a mere caretaker ) to anticipatetrouble . But on so fair a sabbath no one was looking for trouble . Skinny , who already esteemed himself a connoisseur of church rituals , had probably boasted too much of his privilegein being invited to attend a Friends ' Meeting for Worship . When Ingram Sylvester Duffle so very politely called on Miss Barton , expressed his amenity as usual by louting low and asked if he could go too , Aunt Bee was innocently touched . What , she thought , could be more wholesome for the poor fellow than the peaceful silent meeting ? She may have had twinges of doubt but when she consulted Uncle Dan the latter believed Ingram 's request a moving tribute to the kindly influenceof Quaker doctrine . There may have been a little selfishnessalso in Dan 's encouragement . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he considered an achievement . That period , when as many as possible of the world 's noisier tenants are briefly and blessedly segregated for devotion , is an intimation of paradise for the student . " Never  |p239say  I do n't believe in religion , " said Uncle Dan ; " I get my best work done while other people are in church . " So he watched with affectionate cheer as Aunt Bee went off toward the Key Street car with Jeff and Skinny at each elbow , while Ingram Sylvester Duffle rearing his long neck out of a very tight collar skipped ridiculously from side to side of the party in his efforts at seemly escort . It was ominous , perhaps , that Bert and Star leered at them unseen round the corner of TwentiethStreet . Ingram was wearing the outsize overcoat and his first suit of long trousers , a light sandy color , rigidly creased . " Be careful of those store pants , " yelled Star . " Shut up , you big dudes , " Ingram muttered , almost tripping over a sycamore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Madam , it will be more lady-like for you , and I can keep my mind on my instructions . " Meeting was preceded by Bible School , in which Ingram scored an unexpected success . Good-natured Miss Broker who supervised Jeff 's class recognized the obvious frailties of IngramSylvester Duffle and wanted to give him a chance to show . It appeared he had been solidly tutored in the more dramatic fables of Israel . The episode was mentioned of the ill-mannered children who teased the bald-headed prophet . " And does anyoneremember what happened to them ? " the teacher asked . " They were eaten by she-bears , " said Ingram , rocking to and fro and grinning with satisfaction . " Yes , and there are still bears in the mountains of Lebanon , " said Miss Broker , who had duly studied her International Lesson . She could not have guessed that the T.S.O. 4 had made an expedition to the zoo only a few days before , where Ingram had been specially pleased by the grizzly which they always called Mr. Bolton ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion of the schoolmaster . Ingram was already tensed by subtle pokes and proddings from Skinny and Jeff who had rather hoped for an outburst . He felt his mind lighten and leap with that uncontrollable inward flame . " Bears ! " he exclaimed . ( He saw them emerging from the P240underbrush of a cedared mountainside . ) " Great ole sinful cinnamonbears ! Those children tormented the prophet until he was sick to his gorge . He was compelled to abolish them . He whistled up his marauding she-bears and they just onslaughteredthose kids . It hurt them more than it did him , it was a lesson to them , the big fiends , the big fiends . Their fathers and mothers and Dr. Eutaw came rushing out from their ole synagogueand the bears had them all worried to bits . Grrrr ! " With gleaming eyes and shock black hair Ingram was on all fours in the orderly little circle , growling and pawing and pretending to attack his astounded neighbors . " You big fiends , I mean you big dudes , you better go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The other members of the class hoped that Ingram Sylvester Duffle was going to be a regular visitor . They speculated in Quaker decorum , what fascinating sect might Ingram belong to ? and made innocent suggestions among themselves . But though Ingram quieted down without further disorder , the class was dismissed a little early . Geoffrey tried to apologize to Miss Broker for the outbreak . The teacher 's chief alarm had been that the superintendent of the First Day School would appear , as she was sometimes supposedto be too lenient in correction . " At any rate , " she said , " I 'm glad to find a boy who takes his religion so seriously . What is he , a Methodist ? " There was always a few minutes ' recess between Bible School and the Meeting for Worship . During this time small girls swarmed into the library to borrow copies of the Prudy Books , the Little Colonel , Chatterbox , or Little Miss Weesie . The boys had their chance for an airing in the courtyard between the Bible School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ingram Sylvester Duffle to obey the instructions that occupied his frail tenacious wits . Star and Bert had explained it all with care , though even they could not have foreseen the accident  |p241that  the Meeting House caretaker had gone off to find drugs for a grinding toothache . Ingram 's kind heart , always friendly to the unfortunate , had been wrung by Star and Bert , who had explained to him the poverty of Quaker ritual . What the Friends subconsciously desire ( these big fiends had explained ) is incense . They sit in a bare room , Ingram was told , with nothing to do but twirl their thumbs and listen to homilies . It was now understandable why Ingram Sylvester Duffle had worn his long flapping overcoat on this bright spring day . For he had been given a parcel of incense to carry in his pocket and told how to find the Meeting House basement and put the perfume in the furnace . " Is it frankincense and myrrh ? " he asked hopefully . They assured him it was . So when Ingram Sylvester Duffle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hang up his overcoat , and skipped with an extraordinaryair of stealth across the courtyard and into the cellar , they only thought it was amusing he should suppose the basementwas the cloakroom . He reappeared promptly with an air of conscious piety , and grasped Miss Barton 's arm with solicitousdignity as they approached the Meeting House . " Now , Ingram , you behave yourself and no she-bears , " whispered his tormentors . " Shut up , you big dudes . I guess I know how to behave in church , " he growled . His voice came out unexpectedly loud , startling some placid Friends entering with them . Skinny of course was keenly interested in the routine of Quaker devotion . Since he knew he was in for a long sit he was relieved to find the cushions softer than anything Unitarian  --  probablybecause a Friends ' congregation has less opportunity to take the weight off its hams . " Who are those ? " he whispered , observing several men of grave demeanor sitting on raised benches facing the meeting . " Those are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old lady in a dove-colored bonnet took her place on the female side of the dais . It was natural for P242Skinny to ask was this Susannah , but Aunt Bee decided to dividethe boys and sit between Ingram and the other two . Natural human rustlings subsided and Skinny , all eyes and ears , found himself in a silence more intense than he had ever known . He could even hear the small rhythm of Aunt Bee 's breathing . The air was warm to the edge of drowsiness ; the conscientious caretaker , in spite of his tooth , had built a strong fire to dispel the Puritan frigor which accumulates in an unused building in a cold April week . Aunt Bee , before passing into an innocent nescience , reflected how well the boys were behaving , and Ingram especially . He had shown a spark of excitement when he saw a bunch of artificial Quaker ladies on a spring hat . This seemed to him so appropriate that it required admiring comment . But he was safely separated from the other two and except that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed docile enough . Perhaps he has caught cold , thought Aunt Bee , and made Geoffrey pass over his handkerchief . Skinny , by sloping this way and that , could get a good view of the elders ; one of them had a very pale face and a large pink beard which particularly fascinated him . He could just see the head , truncated by someone 's shoulder . Somehow it made him think of John the Baptist beheaded . He was shocked that some of the elders still had their hats on . This seemed to him to nullify the whole idea of a religious service . Why should this dreadful accident happen just the day he was there ? Would they have to cancel the meeting and hold it over again ? He whispered to Jeff , " They 've gone to sleep and forgotten to take their hats off . " Jeff started to laugh but managed to turn it into a sneeze . Then the queer thing was he could n't seem to stop sneezing . He leaned across Skinny and prodded Aunt Bee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered . But at that moment Ingram sneezed also , a beauty . Even the filaments on Aunt Bee 's hat quivered , and a man with a large naked nape just in front of P243Ingram shivered slightly . He wiped the back of his neck , which looked as if it would turn round , but the Quaker discipline is firm . They were sitting alongside the center aisle and close to a large hot-air register . It was perhaps right that Ingram SylvesterDuffle was among the first to feel the effects of his incense , which was a couple of pounds of prime red pepper . Skinny was later than the others in feeling the irresistible tingle . He had been watching the face of John the Baptist . Experienced Friends would have known that this chandelier of the inner light was by no means asleep . A rapid pulsation of his eyelids and several unconscious tremors of the **26;8221;TOOLONG were recognizable symptoms . The benches of the hierarchy were further removed from furnace outlets and although it seemed to Friend Eli Caton that the meeting was a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was several weeks since he had given testimony and he had a Concern . The scriptural injunction to give no heed to one 's message , it will be forthcoming when necessary , was one that he strictly obeyed . Indeed this was one reason why Uncle Dan came to meeting so seldom . But Skinny , inexperienced to the symptoms of ecstasy , watched absorbed . He saw John the Baptist rise abruptly , knit his fingers together and turn the palms briskly outward , and announce , " Did not our hearts burn within us by the way ? " The bright eyes of the speaker seemed to fix Skinny with an unseeing stare and he waited for an answer to the question . At that moment the face of the heartburnerunderwent strange transformation . Again the eyelids flapped repeatedly , all the massive features seemed to ripple together and then fly apart . Friend Caton horrified himself and the Meeting with a roaring sneeze which blew his beard sideways . It was like a signal of release . Those who had writhed and strangled in secret unconsciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sylvester Duffle , now realizing that something was wrong , gargled and wept and turned trag- P244ically to Aunt Bee . " The big fiends , the big fiends ! " he exclaimed . Jeff with streaming features snatched back his handkerchief . But it takes more than hysteria to dominate a Friend just embarked upon a Concern . With a very large handkerchief to his face Friend Caton reached down and shook hands with the elder at his side . This formally dissolved the gathering . " I am sorry , Friends , " he said . " There seems to be something wrong . The meeting will migrate to the Assembly Room in the Bible School . " And when some fifteen minutes later all were transferredand the silence resumed ( punctured with a few snuffles ) Skinny was astounded to see John the Baptist exhibit the same preliminary gestures , and continue his discourse without even repeating the text . " It was n't our hearts that burned , it was our noses , " Jeff explained later to Uncle Dan . The caretaker returning to duty with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his clients streaming across the courtyardwith wet eyes and pink noses . " It looked like a rum demons ' convention , " he reported at home , " but anyway , the excitement cured my tooth . " Subsequent question caused pain to Bert and Star , who wailed and confessed their ingenious plot . But Mr. Lanvale , a lawyer , admitted to Uncle Dan that under cross-question his son had shown unmistakable talent for the bar . " What do you suppose he put up as a defense ? " said Mr. Lanvale . " He said I 'd been all the time telling him to read Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer , so he did , and the tricks Huck and Tom played in church put this idea into his head . I would n't be surprised there 's been a whole generation of kids cutting up in church on account of Mark Twain . I guess maybe literature has more effect on actual life than I supposed . " Mark Twain might well have considered the aftermath a tribute to his art . Star and Bert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Friends ' Meeting , also to apologize to Miss Barton . " Maybe she would n't mind waiting till tomorrow , my eyes are still red , " said Bert . " So are hers , " said Jeff . " You can apologize to me instead . " " It 's not just my eyes that 's red , " said Star , who had been contemplating Mr. Lanvale 's efficiency by examining himself backward in a mirror . " I 'm embarrassed , " Jeff said to Uncle Dan , " because both Star and Bert got a terrible thrashing . In the T.S.O. 4 we 're supposed to go dibbies , share and share alike . It 's Article Six in the Constitution . You better give me a licking too . " Uncle Dan said he could n't do it in cold blood . " If you do n't , the boys will . I 'd rather have it in privacy . " " Try Aunt Bee , " said Uncle Dan . " She 's got a stronger characterthan I have . " Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was overdue on many counts . " Bend over that chair , " she ordered tartly . " I 'll get Uncle Dan 's old razor-strop . I always wondered why we saved it . Now I know . " Dan left the house hastily , not to hear the sound of leather . He knew that Bee would lay on with vigor , and probably weep in secret afterward . It would n't do Jeff any harm , and would be a catharsis for her . " Say , you 're strong , " said Jeff . " I could n't help yowling . I guess I feel better now . I mean , I feel more democratic . " Even Skinny did not escape ; the other three overpowered him and handed on their own concussion . Ingram Sylvester Duffle felt almost slighted that he himself had escaped punishment , but the boys agreed that he was really blameless . " The Constitution do n't apply , " they said . " You 're only an honorary member . You 're not really all there . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most there of anybody in this crowd . I 'm sick and tired of such nonsense . You 're stuck up . " He threatened them with his large fists .   " Well , you 're too big and powerful , " said Star tactfully . " You might get excited . " " Let 's go up in the barn , " suggested Bert . " There 's straw to sit on . " They retired to the hayloft to talk things over . There were a few mouldy jujubes , gumdrops and crackers left in their cache in an old cupboard . Gumdrop sandwiches were an invention of their own . Skinny 's tasted saltier than the others . After a good deal of face-mopping Skinny said he was surprised that things did n't happen in Friends ' Meeting more often , because there was nothing to read , no distractions against mischief . " You sit like that , all alone in your mind , " he said , " and maybe it 's not good for you . Even the ladies ' hats are not very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a hymnal . " " Sure there ought , " said Bert . " Hymns Ancient and Modern . I think they 're all ancient . I never could find any modern ones . " " It 's bad to read hymns without singing them , " said Star . " They sound awful exaggerated . " Jeff naturally stood up for the Quaker doctrine . " You-all are just bigoted . You got ta have enough Holy Spirit in you to understand that kind of thing ; yes sir , you 're bigoted . " " Yay , yay , old bigoty-bigot , " cried Star , turning a handspring . " Let 's play leap-frog . " " Shut up , you big fiends , you 're punko . Go way back and sit down . Twenty-three for you , now we 're having a nice talk , " mumbled Ingram Sylvester Duffle . He enjoyed serious conversationand resented its turning into horseplay as it so often did . Poor soul , he knew intuitively that if excitement got the better of him anything might happen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now look what you did , you dumb ox , " Star squawked , " you sat me down hard on a broken bottle . I 've got BromoSeltzerin my tail and it was sore already . "   " You shut up yourself , you 're just vulgar . If Dr. Eutaw knew how I have to associate with you he 'd send me to a sanitarium , he said so . " " There 's worse things than red pepper happens in churches , " said Bert . " You bet , " said Jeff . " I went to your kind of religion in England one time but it 's got more class to it , I guess , it 's Established Church . Gee , they 've got some terrible bad words . They 're pretty near ashamed of them themselves because they turn sideways and duck their heads . There 's one word they use I would n't even think of . " " What is it ? " exclaimed Star and Bert . " No sir , " said Jeff firmly . " Besides maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mumble it so you ca n't be sure . " " Spell it backward , " suggested Star , " and we 'll pronounce it for you . " " No , I guess it 's just an English word , " said Jeff . " I bet they do n't have any dirty words in England as dirty as we have , " said Star . " You 're crazy , all the smutty words came from England to begin with . They were busy thinking them up while this countrywas nothing but Indians . " " You could write some down in the minutes , " said Bert , " and then go away while we read them . We could tell you if they 're really so bad . " " Now you big fiends , " interrupted Ingram , " let 's keep this meeting on a high plane . I 'm going to be a good influence in this club . " " I did n't know how rotten things are until my Pop left his bookcase unlocked , " said Bert . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Aw shucks , that 's nothing , " said Star , " we got the Century Dictionary right out in the sitting-room . " " Dictionaries ai n't any good , " said Bert . " You got ta know how to spell anything before you can look it up . "  | " You sound awful dumb to me , " said Ingram . " What was it happened in your church , Bert ? " " I had a slick way to get even with my sister . She had some kind of a tizzic . " " How do you spell it ? " asked Jeff . " I do n't know , I guess it 's not in the dictionary . Kind of hay fever , she was sneezing all the time . She kept on scolding me about bad manners , you know what girls are , so one Sunday when we went to church I took along her atomizer . I had it hid under my coat and every time she sneezed I sprayed it all over the lady in front . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snotting all over her . She turned round and made an awful fuss . They got the ushers into it , too , as a matterand fact it was really kind of antiseptic but my Pop took it out of me in the long run , like they always do . Gee , I 'm so tanned behind I could sit on broken glass and never feel it . " " We better vote , " said Star , " or we 'll be late at the spring . " The subject of the ballot was which form of religion the club considered most promising for Salvation . The result was as might have been expected : Presbyterian i , Unitarian r , Episcopaliani , Society of Friends ( thanks to the novitiate of Ingram Sylvester Duffle ) 2 . " Fen crowning King Edward , " shouted Jeff . " Dibbies on Master of the Horse , " cried Ingram . He was so proud of this nomination that he always forgot it involved pulling the wagon up the hill . The crowning of King Edward VII , then much mooted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water Company . It was supposedto give their cargo a royal sparkle . Jeff had noticed that the rounded iron standpipe resembled the pate of the elderly monarch . To fill the drinking bowl which hung on a chain , hold it solemnly aloft , then clank it deftly on the metal skull so that the water flowed evenly over the scalp , was the procedurethey called coronation . It was very satisfying when well done , while the other members stood at courtly attention . Thep249guerillas of Mount Royal looked on with sneers but one growl , " Skiddoo , you big fiends , " from Ingram was enough to keep them at a distance . Perhaps inspired by the ecclesiastical discussionJeff accomplished the rite with unusual skill . " Oyez , oyez ! The Archbishop of Canterbury approaches the historic throne , " he announced . " Is the Stone of Scoon under the chair ? It is . Are the Master of Horse and his Equerries ready for the Unction ? " It was desirable to make haste ; Ingram was already tremulouswith hysteria . " I crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A word came into his mind , he did n't know why . " A chrism ! " he shouted . Please act as arbiter in a linguistic dispute ( wrote Uncle Dan to Blanche Bristol ) . Bee and Geoff submitted it to me but now they 've got me confused . I had no idea I was raising such a young stickler . Bee and Geoff were out in the yard planting some lilac stubs we brought from Greenaway . It 's wonderful what Bee has done in the way of beautifying our wretched little space . She 's perfectly happy if she can grub around in a patch of dirt , no matter how small . She remarked to Geoff that she was " happy as a grig " and he demurred . He said that grigs are n't " happy , " they 're merry . They argued about it until now I 'm uncertain myself . If it has to be merry , then Bee is n't exactly a grig . She has her own stoical mode of showing satisfaction , but merry is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : if people are n't in it he 'll put them there . You rememberMrs . Maggots next door , from whose basilisk eye we will soon be mercifully shielded by masses of Virginia creeper . She fascinated Geoff from the beginning , he used to sit on a box in the yard and fix her with a retaliating gaze . One day he came indoors in triumph announcing , " I made her flinch . " Bee took him down , however , by saying , " You have n't made her P250cower . " But the boy had to account to himself somehow for the poor lady 's persistent stare . He invented all sorts of fantastic motives and explanations , including even a romance in which she was the relict of a frustrated jerrybuilder who had buried a hoard of treasure exactly in our backyard ; so that every time Aunt Bee goes digging Mrs. Maggots fears we 'll find her doubloons and pieces-of-eight . But this was only the beginning : it developed into a series of comic drawings , " The Melodramas of Mrs. Maggots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outrage , undergoing every kind of calamity and triumphing over disaster by the steadfast fixity of her gaze . Killer whales , jungle tigers , Indians , cyclones , volcanoes , onrushingtrains , are all shown in these pictures as quelled and sidetracked by Mrs. Maggots ' superhuman orb . Her only human weakness is the exclamation which concludes every series : with a memorial sigh she relaxes and says Phew ! This perhaps is out of character . Geoff got it from my earnest graduatestudent Miss Towson . It is Miss T 's only sign of emotion . Eventually , of course , The Eye proves to be glass . One of the best of the cartoon serials is where Mrs. Maggots thinks she has discovered the treasure but Geoff refutes her by showingthey are not doubloons but only singloons . I never saw a child have so much fun with words : the fiscal system of Jefflandhas been revised lately , due , I daresay , to some school allusion to " resumption of specie payments , " a phrase that tickles Geoff for some reason . The monetary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petite monnaie is now reckoned in coins called reps and demi-reps . As a result of recent unsuccessful wars with LaGrange , Jeffland is paying an indemnity and you may imagine me smiling as I overhear Skinny Granger remark , " You owe me another shipment of ten thousand demi-reps . " The North Avenue Unitarian Church would be surprised to know that its neat little envelopes for Free-Will Offerings are used to hold these shipments . Bee reproaches Geoff for all the irresponsible fables he in- P251vents about Mrs. Maggots or other neighbors . In the good old Wilford tradition Bee draws a rather definite line between truth and falsehood but I urge that every artist has to account to himself for phenomena he observes  --  and as a child can not possiblyknow enough facts to account for the world 's grotesque behavior he must naturally invent plots of his own to explain it . I did n't mean to write all this irrelevance , it 's just a way of postponing what was most uncomfortably on my mind . I did n't get the appointment to the University . Naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a step up in so many ways . I know it seems absurd , but I rather believe it was still an aftermath of the old Friedeck trouble . I do n't remember any too well just what it may have been that rubbed our Prussian friend the wrong way . You 'd think he also might have forgotten about it by now , but I have it from trustworthy report that when my name came up at the academic council Friedeck insisted that I am not a genuine scholar , have no doctor 's degree , in short , no philologist . Which I fear is true . I felt pretty badly about this for a while and for some quite special reasons which I need not enlarge . One piece of good news , though , they have just appointed me official delegate from Patapsco for the inauguration of Woodrow Wilson at Princeton next fall . I take that to mean that Beinbrink has it in mind to promote me : they would hardly send anyone below a full professor to such an academic gala ? There will surely be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of them will be useful to meet . Do you know who will be going from Radnor ? Tell Kilda I wish I had a Dublin gown , those wonderful sleeves in McGillicuddy green . I 've been a bit tired and jaded . If you knew what my studentscan do to the eighteenth century you 'd forgive anything . I 'm going off for a few days ' jaunt with my friend Huffy ( Dr. Huffenbutz ) , or as the students call him , Hoof-in-boots . He 's a good companion for a vacation ; as he 's a physicist we do n't either of us talk shop . He endeared himself specially to me P252when we were cycling together  --  whenever I got a puncture he insisted on repairing it because he said it was a pretty little problem in pneumatics and he likes above all things to work with his hands . That suited me perfectly . As reciprocity he always lets me do the bargaining for a night 's lodging . He says my air of false naivete blandishes the rustic housewife . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geoff 's steam engine for us when I was baffled . Did it ever strike you , if you scratch an American you find a mechanicDan interrupted himself . And if you scratch me , he thought somberly , what would be found ? An uncle . . . but this kind of self-question is too destructive . " If the sun and moon should doubt , they 'd immediately go out . " For consolation he approached a sentimental hiding-place on one of the bookshelves . Discreetly slipped between Coleridge and Keats ( the exact neighborhood had been given much thought ) were three thin pamphlets : Transformations of a Quartic , Bimagic Squares , and A Note on Determinants . Two of these were primly inscribed " D. B. with the author 's compliments , " but Bimagic Squares seemed more intimate . On it was written " D. B. from B. B. " Though the pages consisted mostly of inscrutable blocks of numbers completely mysterious to Dan , this was his favorite . In the world of scholars there is no gesture of regard so tender as the exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the bonbons and nosegays of the higher faculty . It may be thought that in these austere exchangesMiss Bristol had something the better of it . Professor Barton 's most esteemed research  --  On the Decline of VisualizingPower in Wordsworth After 182 o  --  was at least legible to its recipient . Indeed he had even embarrassed her by introducingher in a very small footnote . " For climatological graphs bearing upon the topic I am indebted to Miss B. Bristol , Radnor College . " To casual readers ( if there are such ) of the Modern Language Quarterly this footnote would seem just the fine con- P253science of learning , but it could also be estimated as a form of academic showing-off . He sighed gently as he glanced again at the leaflets , printed mostly in the runic symbols of that printing house in Lancaster , Pa. , which is the Mount Sinai of the polymath . Perhaps even Blanche herself had realized that these essays were meager nourishment . What a stride it had been when after her visit at Christmas she sent him the dressing-gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his room for her and slept in the study . Or worse , Geoffrey might have told her . . . He returned to the letter : Bee and I were disturbed when you wrote you had been plagued all spring by " an obstinate quartic . " We thought at first it was some kind of fever or migraine . Bee was going to advise rhubarb and soda . I went so far as to look up those pricelesspassages in Dr. Johnson 's Letters where he recommends his orange-peel specific to an accomplished female friend . But I have just looked again at your Works and realize that the Quartic is some kind of recalcitrant equation ? So we feel relieved . If it has yielded to analysis , why do n't you come down after the end of term and pay us a visit ? Bee has been brewing a new vintage of root beer which she annunciates as fete de cuvee , and I know Geoff would welcome some help with his algebra now just beginning . I 'm not much use at that , like S. T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mathematics very slippery to climb . I see you up there in the branches as independentas the Cheshire Cat  --  or the Shropshire Possum . It is very sweet of the good Possum to let me unload like this . I began this letter in a fit of the dumps , but I got into my dressing-gown here in the study , even the alley is relatively quiet , and I feel better . After all a dressing-gown is the most spiritual present anyone can give . It wraps the mind in and the world out in the hours when one most needs to make friends with one 's self . Perhaps that was why your hero Sherlock P254Holmes solved his problems with one .  --  But myself , I carry the fancy farther still and think that the thaumaturgic mantle Prospero used to put on for his doings with Ariel was really the dressing-gown he wore at his studies . I better not let Geoff get hold of that word thaumaturgiche'llrun it into the ground . It had been a bad day from the beginning . Mr. Bolton , lookingeven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the whole school in morning assembly . Even though this reduced the first classroom period by several minutes its purport was devastating . Nobody had confessed about setting the lumber pile on fire . There was n't a boy above the kindergarten who did n't know that Bill Shawbuck , in a pang of nausea , had dropped a lighted Little Recruit between the scantlings ( they were building an addition to the gym ) but it was no one 's business to tell if Bill did n't . Now Mr. Bolton said that unless the guilt was honorably admitted there would be no leave that noon to watch the circus parade go down Cardinal Street . A low moan of despair sounded among two hundred boys . If Mr. Bolton was as shrewd as one believed , he could guess the culprit pretty well by seeing the instinctive lining up of glances toward the callous Bill . Yet perhaps Bill was not so hardened after all . In the damnablycomplicated psychology of fourteen his feeling probably was that he had fessed up once already and surely that was enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashes of penance from the Lenten Mass that morning . He had confessed his guilt to the priest and that practical theologian had of course commanded him to tell the truth at school . And Bill had done so : he took his brother into the furnace room and told him . " Maybe you better tell Mr. Bolton , " said Bill to Jellybean . But even for one of Jellybean 's tough fiber this wasP255too painful a dilemma . He suspected that Bill wanted to come clean , but for Jelly to serve as informer would put him on record forever not only as a tattle and sneak , but a traitor to his own blood . It was strange to see the usually carefree and domineering Shawbucks oppressed by the power of mass opinion . Indignant looks seemed actually palpable as the crowd clattered up and down the iron stairs  --  and how iron the treads can feel to the heavy feet of shame . In moving masses of boys that shuffled through the halls the Shawbucks encountered knees and elbows and sharp anonymous pinches which they well guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Skinny , who had suffered many indignities from Shawbuckhands and feet , were elated to join the general disgust . " Why do n't you wash your face ? " said Jeff , addressing Bill with a look of such frank hatred that even Bill was startled . This was the extreme of insult . Jeff , quakerishly ignorant of the religioussymbolism , quite honestly supposed the Ash Wednesday smear was just Shawbuck sloven . The attendant Jellybean , with every muscle cocked to glean whatever small salvage might come his way , projected a hardy shin and Jeff went sprawling . But Bill for the moment seemed cowed . He may even have lain awake the night before anticipating disaster , though indeed that would be rare in the confident house of Shawbuck . At any rate Bill had not studied his lessons . They were in English III when Ringling Brothers went down Cardinal Street with chariots and white horses . The classroomis often very apropos in satirizing the current event : there was a painful timeliness in the early stanzas of The Ancient Mariner , their assignment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming warble of the steam calliope ) , but the parade itself was hidden behind the gym . Looking desolately across the pebbled playground they could see for an instant the lofty head of the giraffe riding in its wheeled and gilded crib . The first giraffe ever to Participate in a Public Pageant , thep256Sun-Paper had assured them ; and just then the gangling quadrupedgazed across with bulging eyes as if to reproach them for not being out on the street to welcome it . What was worse still , the scaffolding of their own gym was swarmed over by small colored boys enjoying a perfect view . The teachers themselves were a trifle acrid that morning . They would n't have admitted it but they enjoyed parades as much as anyone . " This is just as exciting as any circus , " said Mr. Lidgate sharply . " Granger , close the windows . " Skinny tarried at the task as long as he dared but the big sashes were finally pulled down ; the chords of the steam organ and all the brazen ta-ra-ra ( which seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . " Instead of Ringling Brothers , let 's try Shawbuck Brothers , " said Mr. Lidgate . " Bill , read from there . " " The ice was here , the ice was there , " mumbled Bill . His enunciation was never very clear but today his private sorrows made him specially gruff . " Please hold your head up and read as if you thought it made sense . " Bill straightened his long neck and a deeper flush seemed to blend into one color his rich dapple of orange freckles . A rub of his arm across a damp forehead transferred the symbolical ashes to his shirtsleeve . Jeff and Skinny , who flanked him from behind , rejoiced with malice in these signals of distress . He looks like a giraffe , Skinny wrote hastily on the margin of Jeff 's book . This drew Jeff 's attention to one particular word on the page . It was a new textbook just handed out to them the day before . Jeff of course had not prepared the lesson . He had spent his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by heart anyhow . But now he saw in an ecstasy something on the page which might cause the downfall of the unsuspectingBill . He pointed it out to Skinny and they nudged each other with joyous expectancy . " The ice was here , the ice was there , " gabbled Bill , " the ice P257was all around : it cracked and growled and roared and howled like noises in a sound . " " Like a circus parade , " said Mr. Lidgate , getting an insinceretitter from several bootlickers . " What does he mean by the last line ? " " Just noises , " said Bill sulkily . " Noises in a sound , a sound made up of a lot of noises . " Jeff 's and Skinny 's arms were wavingfuriously on Bill 's left . He looked round at them with a curious mixture of threat and appeal . Mr. Lidgate paid no attention to these gestures which were sometimes too frequent . " Noises in a sound ? " he said . " Ca n't you read ? " " Sure he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bill sat together and shared the same book . " It 's just common sense . " The rest of the class sat in prudent dumbness enjoying this unexpected episode , but Skinny and Jeff were almost on their feet with eagerness . " Granger and Barton , the Heavenly Twins , " said Mr. Lidgate . " What seems to be the agitation ? Granger , borrow a handkerchiefif you have n't got one and wipe your face . " " It 's a misprint in the book , " screamed Geoffrey . " It says sound . It ought to be swound . " It took some time to clear up the misunderstanding , because Mr. Lidgate was using a different book . Until he had come down from his desk and examined the new texts he thought perhaps some sort of joke was being played . To the delight of the class he then took time out for a sermon on the relativity of error . This gave opportunity for some ingenious drawings of circus parades at the back of the room . " Nobody should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of judgmentwhere the data were not available for making a correct choice . To get a thing wrong is not discreditable if you were given erroneous premises to start from . I can not help thinking , however , that you might have been familiar with one of the most famous passages in literature . " They proceeded to a dis- P258cussion of swoon and swound . " The latter , " said Mr. Lidgate , " was an old-fashioned or rustic pronunciation . " But Bert Eutaw insisted that his father always said it that way . " My mother fell downstairs in a swound , " he said , " it was just her time of life . " " Never mind the family details , " said Mr. Lidgate . " You can read from there . " Again there was trouble , for in his agitationBert read " through the fog " instead of " thorough the fog . " " Why do you suppose he said thorough the fog ' ? " asked Mr. Lidgate , thinking sadly to himself what a way to treat a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " piped Geoffrey . " It sounds more difficult , " added Skinny , " like the bird findingits way in the fog . " Bill Shawbuck breathed more freely to find attention diverted . He parted his lips very slightly in a syllable audible only to his brother . Skinny and Jeff had saved him but he knew that was not their intention . After the excitements of The Ancient Mariner , orchestrated by the bassoons of Ringling , Jeff looked forward to the usual tranquility of Caesar 's campaign in Gaul . That general would have been surprised to know that his diary of campaign could become a noontime sedative for small boys . But Mr. Rhodes 's class was conducted on principles of order and method . The pupils were called upon regularly in turn so that one always knew one 's safety margin against question . Rather like G. J. Caesar himself , Mr. Rhodes ( naturally known to the class as " Dusty " ) would almost prefer not to conquer the enemy than to succeed by unconventional maneuver . Action was proceeding on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still protected by several intervening auxiliaries . The invaders were not yet very deep in Gaul ; indeed they had only just become familiar with the awkward preference for the subjunctive mood shown by Diviciacus the Haeduan . Little did they realize that this peculiar form of syntax would spread all the way fromp259Mediterranean to English Channel and even embarrass tourists two thousand years to come . As Skinny once remarked in a moment of bitterness , " I would n't have minded the Romans walloping the Gauls if they had n't taught them to talk in subjunctives . " Well did Allen and Greenough in their Preface speak of Indirect Discourse as " the bugbear of Latin education . " Skinny had adorned the margin with a picture of a bugbear , a cross between Mr. Bolton and the grizzly . " Chapter 29 . W. Shawbuck , take it from there , " said Mr. Rhodes . Skinny nudged Jeff ; he knew this was going to be good . " In castris Helvetiorum , in the camp of the Helvetians , tabulae repertae skint , tables are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek confectionery . " A blissful and suspended silence concealed all small sounds or distractions . The class held its breath . Was Bill so besotted that he would try to bluff it through ? Did not even Jellybean have sense enough to say " We are not prepared "  --  since everyoneknew that the Shawbucks performed mutually . Even Mr. Rhodes 's young and austere face showed the innocent pleasure of one finding some shining gem among rubbish . " How do you suppose the Greek confectionery got there ? " he asked . His deceptive serenity lured Bill deeper into the mire . " I suppose it was those merchants who sold stuff to the troops . It says so in the next clause : quibus in tabulis nominatim ratio confecta eras , on which tables was the aforesaid candy ration . " " What kind of tables do you think these were ? " Bill was beyond succor . " Sort of lunch tables . " " Since you all seem to be translating at sight this morning , " said Mr. Rhodes , " let 's go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This will tell us more about those candy merchants . It 's a very interesting passage because it shows the effect the Germans had on all those little Mediterranean peddlers . In case it had n't occurred to you that Caesar had a sense of humor , P260you 'll find it in his description of the panic that runs through the camp , and Caesar 's civilian friends , sort of members of Congress who 'd been looking over the campaign , suddenly discoverthat urgent personal business needs their attention at home ; others send out for a lawyer to make their wills . It 's a difficult little chapter , look it over for a couple of minutes and then we 'll see who wants to try it . " Skinny 's hand went up first . " By the talk of our men , " he said , slowly exploring the layers of indirect discourse , " and the reports of the Gauls and traders , who kept saying that the Germanswere of such huge bodily size , of incredible valor and skill with their weapons  --  often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in the face and the  --  aciem oculorum  --  gosh , I can see what that means , but I ca n't think how to say it . " " We might say penetrating gaze , ' " said Mr. Rhodes , " but perhaps we can do better . Aciem : that means first something sharp , a point or a keen edge , and then a line of battle  --  " " The flash of their eyes , " suggested Skinny . " Their steely gaze , " offered Bert . " They looked daggers ! " exclaimed Jeff . " Good ! Very good ! " said Mr. Rhodes . " Now that 's the way to translate . " The Shawbucks were of the superior clique who ate lunch in the school 's dining-room on the top floor . Boys who brought their own sandwiches usually took them out to the playground where they clustered in small groups of mysterious congeniality . This day Jeff and Skinny had so much to talk over they repaired to a window-sill in the locker room in the basement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woes , did not feel like encountering the inevitable chaff of the diningroom . Jellaby had been detained for ominous questioning by the headmaster . Bill , without his ally and feeling every hand raised against him , decided to sneak out through the basement P261and get a hokey-pokey from Santa Claus , as the neighboring vender Pappanicholas was nicknamed . In the rigor of the law this was taboo , since the Sun-Paper had alarmed parents by aheadline BUGS IN HOKEY-POKEY ; but to Bill it seemed thatnothing mattered now . Getting ball and glove from his locker to do a little bouncing on the outdoor pavements , he did not at first notice Jeff and Skinny colloguing in a remote corner . Except for them the gloomy basement was empty . " I guess he 's going out for some of that Greek candy , " Jeff chirped . Bill looked furiously in their direction . At first he did not recognize them , darkened against the wired window . " Oh , it 's you , hey ? Greasy grinds . Crybaby and Gee-offrey . Guffrey , Fatguts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just too cheap-skate to spend a few cents upstairs . I guess you 're afraid they 'll give you chicken soup . " This alluded to Jeff 's very first day at school , when he had eaten in the lunchroom and was hailed simultaneously by two boys . One said , " Hey , new kid , what 's your name ? " and the other : " What 's that you 're eating ? " Confused , Geoffrey had replied to the one who asked his name , " It 's supposed to be chicken soup . " A shout of pleasure rose along the table . " Here 's a new kid says his name 's Chicken Soup . " This humiliating label still irked him . " Why are n't you up there yourself ? " was their natural retort , which seemed to enrage Bill . He snatched Jeff 's package of lunch and scattered the sandwiches on the floor . Jeff had a horrible feeling that he was going to cry , his mouth shook so with nervousness . It was a kind of sickening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully trimmed sandwiches of crab-apple jelly which she cut so carefully , strewn on the dusty cement . He tried to control the quivering of his jaw and slid from the window . Tears of excitement were already streaming on Skinny 's face , which probably encouraged Bill further .   " Going to do something , hey ? That 's fine . Fatguts Guffrey . Want to fight ? " " Come in the furnace room , I 'll have it out with you , " said Jeff with something of a shake in his voice but with such evidentresolve that even Bill was surprised . He pushed Jeff roughly , playing for time since he expected Jellaby to join him at any moment . " Aw , you 're ensi-ent , " he jeered ; a word he had heard his grandmother use mysteriously and which he must have misunderstood ; at any rate he had reserved it as an ultimatereproach . " What you going to fight about ? " " About you , " blurted Jeff ; or that was what he meant to say . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded ridiculously like a sneeze : About-choo . But at the momentlong-suffered anger and alarm blotted all other awareness . He led the way to the furnace room , which was far from ideal for such encounters , but it was the first place he thought of . " I ' 11 attend to you , " he muttered . " Kill him , Jeff , " wept Skinny , following , " and I 'll see fair play . You can have half my sandwiches . " " Stung ! " shouted Bill , seizing Skinny 's lunch also and throwingit into the open door of the firebox . The beautifully scientific and maneuvered combat that Jeff had often imagined did not take place . Outraged Skinny , whose tear ducts belied his valiant heart , threw himself bodily on Bill with a howl of rage . With teeth and knees and nails and feet all working he staggered the larger boy , while Jeff must also have exercised a useful fist since his knuckles ached for days . There was something so berserk about the attack that Bill was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lump of coal from the bin . But the janitor , before going off for his own lunch , had shaken down the fire and raked ashes into the pit where the furnace stood . Bill , stepping too far , went over into the depression . It was quite a fall in itself , but also he landed full sprawl in the pile of cinders . They looked like gray clinkers , P263but there were red coals underneath and the mass was fiery hot . With a yell of anguish and a smell of burning cloth Bill sprang up and fled wildly to the washroom . Even his enemies were horrified and helped him anoint his blisters with soap . He mumbled unintelligible grievance , said he felt sick , and departedfor home without waiting for further disaster . Grimly LaGrange and Jeffland watched Bill hobble up the bicycle ramp from the basement , with two smoldered gaps in the rear of his pantaloons . " I bet he wo n't forget Ash Wednesday , " said Skinny . " Lend me your snot-rag . " Jeff suddenly realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one good blow . At any rate , he reflected later , one fine thing about that fight was , it did n't start a lifelongfriendship . He never had any use for the Shawbucks and that was undoubtedly mutual . But he still blushed in secret for his agonized outcry : About-choo ! That was a crude thing to say , he thought sadly . Perhaps it was the Album at Greenaway that stimulated Aunt Bee to compile a new series of scrapbooks . In the evening , when Uncle Dan had retired to his study and Jeff spread out homeworkon the dining table , Aunt Bee had a chance to settle down in her cozy corner and take the evening paper seriously . She was delighted by the miscellany of reprinted poems and household hints that lurked in its pages . Her private scissors and paste , if Jeff had n't made off with them , were busy fastening these into exercise books that fattened rapidly . Her secret fantasy , as she sat in winter in the gust of the hot-air register , or in summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagine going through these scrapbooks with the old family circle at Wilford . How much Grandma would find to interest her , and what a range of sentiment : from Joaquin Miller , Behind him lay the gray Azores , to Removing inkstains with skim-milk.  |p264Reared  on the Wilford Reporter and Wickham Market Gazette , it was natural that Aunt Bee took her journalism with patient gravity . After a while , however , she began to perceive that here and there were items deliberately in fun . One evening Dan heard her chuckle over something in the Sun-Paper . " What is it ? " he asked . " It 's a letter to the Editor , " she said . " It says : Dear Sir , to settle a dispute , will you inform me , am I right or is she ? '  --  And it 's signed HUSBAND . " " How perfectly idiotic , " said Dan . " The printer must have dropped something out . How can you answer without knowing more details ? " " That 's just the point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . He says She is.  --  Ed . ' " Dan was startled to realize that Bee was actually aware of the American relish for the absurd . Jeff had no interest in the newspaper except on Sunday , when a much put-upon character called Mr. Bowser made his weekly appearance . A short story , with a lively illustration , described Mr. Bowser 's Trials and Tribulations : his wife , or the cook , or the child , the neighbors , the steam laundry , or the cat , got the better of Mr. Bowser in some domestic problem . These fables , mysteriously signed " By M. Quad , " were Jeff 's introduction to the American defensive humor of self-mockery . He rose early on Sundays to read them before breakfast , pasted them carefully in his own scrapbook , and then went through them again , aloud , for Aunt Bee . " Poor Mr. Bowser , " she would say , " no wonder he feels sadly . " Sometimes the ghost of Mr. Bowser even accompanied the Bartons on their Sunday afternoon walk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stroll on the river wall or to the Valley of Fern would have been in Wilford . It was taken gently , as Aunt Bee was not valid for large distance . Rheumatism gave her a slight sideways veer which needed frequent correction by her escort . They used to point P265out a distant landmark and tell her to steer for it , but as soon as she forgot she made leeway , and her struggle to keep straight gave a nodding tremble to what Jeff called her whisk , a little brush of sensitive antennae on the Ipswich bonnet . This , and Uncle Dan 's knotted stick , were the signs of an Occasion . The favorite route was across Cotton Duck Bridge and as far as the old Pavilion Latrobe in the park . This was a pagoda or summerhouseof Moorish form ; it had a polygon ledge a few feet above ground , much favored by children for groping round and weaving through the window spaces . Pavilion Latrobe stood on a wide slope overlooking the lake ; while Jeff clambered Uncle Dan and Aunt Bee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round the lakeside drive , and perhaps the stampede caused by the staccato of a primitive buzzwagon . Or the goal might be the tadpole pond , more remote in the park ; or sometimes a walk through Carroll Woods to hunt chestnuts and chinquapins . On autumn Sundays these groves were thick with flying billets where the Oriole Boys were trying to bring down high-hanging burrs . Once Uncle Dan rashly flung his walking stick high into a tree , aiming at a lofty clump of nuts ; it hooked on a branch and they had to leave it there until a gale brought it down weeks later . Just the kind of thing , Uncle Dan said , that would have happened to Mr. Bowser . Rozanne Towson , the favored graduate student , sometimes joined these expeditions and came back for a real Wilford high tea . It was she who introduced Aunt Bee to waffles , which Miss Barton described as crumpets with patterns on them . But as is often the case with professional students , Miss Towson was well schooled in all forms of imagination displayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountered in daily life . She was surprised to find that the homeward way was usually devoted to an impromptu story about Mr. Bowser ; she thought this very unliterary . But Jeff had taken Mr. Bowser 's troubles to heart and wished to compensate . An idyllic region of Jefflandhad been allotted ; it was called Bowser , and here thatP266harried citizen ruled as Prefect and everything happened to his satisfaction . Here , as Uncle Dan suggested , Mr. Bowser was ert and ept ; he was gruntled and comfitured . Often on the homeward path Uncle Dan was urged to tell a story in which Mr. Bowser would be heroic and triumphant . From much study of Puck Uncle Dan was now familiar with the comedy stereotypesof God 's country . But to Jeff , perhaps even to Aunt Bee , it was all a new and vivid mythology . The boy listened with delight to these simple inventions ; across the vistas of his everchangingrepublic ( which looked just then rather like Druid Hill Park ) he saw a deified Bowser outwitting Chinese laundrymenand German bands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhodeses and Weary Willies , dudes and chollies , fresh drummers and summer boarders , actors on railroad ties and hats concealing bricks . At the peak of these narratives , when Mr. Bowser stood on the brink of some crisis , Miss Towson would ejaculate her innocently sympathetic " Phew ! " Aunt Bee , less impressionable , carried on her own meditations ; perhaps reflecting that the wilderness of America was quite different from her anticipation . It was not a wildness of the frontier but a wildness in the mind . Uncle Dan occasionally apologized to Miss Towson for the crudeness of his effects . " It 's astonishing that no one since Aristophanesseems to have invented any new jokes . Not even Moliere . " " Who was Mulyare ? " Jeff asked . " He was a Frenchman . " " Is M. Quad a Frenchman ? " If the walk took them up Key Street Avenue Extended , where new suburbs were beginning to build , they played Uncle Dan 's game instead . This was Dan 's own version of the ImaginaryCountry ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of generous citizens had recently given Chesapeake Universitya beautiful tract of land ( including Carroll Woods ) on P267which it would eventually build its new home . Uncle Dan , jealousfor the future of little Patapsco , enjoyed choosing a buildinghere or a landscape there and imagining it part of an ideal campus for his own college . Many a flourishing merchant , just settled in his dwelling of New Century Colonial , was unaware that it was lifted over his head and requisitioned in fancy as " That 's the Dean 's house , " or " That might be the Faculty Club , " or " That would be nice for the professor of English . " It was part of the game to settle these migrants in quarters appropriate to their duties . For a teacher of literature or pure science a home would be chosen that had some chance of solitude . IIThey passed a very modest cottage on a byway , whichJeff nominated for the Professor of Bible Studies ; " it would remind him to be humble . " The game was at its pleasantest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh in the excellent smell of damp mortar , new-cut wood and paint . Here , on Sunday afternoons , they could wander and plan their adaptations . The problem of dormitories for the students , an old anxiety ' ' qq at Patapsco , offered spirited discussion . The girls either hustled to and from college in street-cars or lived in boarding houses adjoining . " I think it 's better if the girls do n't live at the college , " Jeff remarked , from his observation of the lodging houses on Patapsco Street . " They 'll only fill the place with mandolins and sofa pillows . " His acute ear had already been distressed by the stridulous and wiry tinkle of that abominable instrument . " I do n't mind it , " said Uncle Dan , " it 's damsels with dul-cimers . " " If we put the dormitories out here , " said Jeff , surveying a region of woods and meadow , " it 'll be too far from Spontoon 's . The girls wo n't be able to get their molasses candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and just come to college to study . Girls are a terrible nuisance around a place . I know what the other boys tell me about their sisters . I guess I 'm spared some awful sights . "   " You must n't be too hard on them , " Uncle Dan suggested . " I had sisters , you know , and they grew up quite nice . " " That 's true . You never think of your aunt as being a lady . " " Maybe we should sometimes , " said Uncle Dan . " Well , anyway in Jeffland they 're not allowed to wear bloomers . It 's such a shock when you see those fat legs . " Uncle Dan inferred that some of the club discussions in Sassafras House were beginning to deal with the ignominies of the other sex . The T.S.O. 4 were probably fortifying themselves in that instinctive suspicion of the female which is the Custer 's Last Stand of boyhood . " You must always be respectful to women , " said Uncle Dan , almost automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadly that this could not be more than half-truth ; natural enough in any statement dealing with only half of humanity . Perhaps people being respectful to them was what infuriatedthem so ? Very likely it was a reaction from this theme that led to the incident of the new bonnet . The Ipswich confection with the whisk had grown a bit familiar . Perhaps Bee clung to it as a sort of last loyalty to East Anglia and Wilford Meeting ; it was a sort of Martello Tower in her mind . Yet there were times , perhaps meeting Mrs. Beinbrink and Mrs. Huffenbutz at a college festival , when Uncle Dan and Jeff dimly realized Aunt Bee 's hat was a museum piece . It was a windy day in spring . Jeff and Skinny were on one of their excursions downtown . They had stopped at the dentist long enough for Skinny to have his tooth-braces tightened . When this happened Skinny was allowed to have money for an ice cream soda , to test his theory that the cold drink would shrink his protesting gums and numb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a mixture of vanilla , pineapple and strawberry syrups ) did not seem sufficiently astringent and Skinny was weeping copiously as they proceeded to look for adventure . Jeff was eager to console , for walking with a tear-P269stained companion is always humiliating . He made various suggestions . " Let 's go to the Pratt and get something by Jules Verne . You have n't read The Steam Elephant , and there 's Tigers and Traitors or The Demon of Cawnpore . " " Damn the Liberry , " moaned Skinny ungratefully . They were moving in the general direction of Chocolate Mice when Jeff noticed for the first time an alley that led to the stage door of a famous old theater . It was a palace of miracle : there they had seen Shakespeare , and the chariots of Ben-Hur , and ( best of all ) Jeff had seen what he called Sherlock Holmes in William Gillette . " Let 's go and look at the stage , " said Jeff , and Skinny dried his eyes . By happy chance the rearward door stood open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dipping a scuttle of beer . The vast gloomy stage was dimly lit by a hanging bulb , tall canvas wings ( trees , scarlet curtains with tassels , marble pillars ) were stacked against the back wall . They tiptoed cautiously toward the front of the stage , gaped into the silent cavern which seemed heavy with utterance just below hearing . Shadowy rows of seats were overhung with cliff-like balconies , curves of gildingcaught faint light like reefs and veins of mica . " It 's like Aeolus 's cave of wind , " whispered the classical-minded Skinny . To Jeff the whole twilight hollow begged for words . " Aye , tear her tattered ensign down ! " he ventured . He was astonished how the empty space gathered , amplified , resonated his voice . He spoke more strongly : " Long has it waved on high , And many an eye has danced to see That banner in the sky . " The clear young tones rang thrillingly in receptive space , he forgot himself with pleasure : " Nail to the mast her holy flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the god of storms , The lightning and the gale ! " " Gee whiz , that 's slick , " exclaimed Skinny . " Let me try . Do n't tread on me ! " he proclaimed rather huskily to the empty house . Perhaps the lingering sniffle in his head made his elocutionall the more appealing as he recited : " The despot 's heel is on thy shore , Maryland ! His torch is at thy temple door , Maryland ! " Jeff chimed in with his favorite lines , which they shouted together : " For life or death , for woe or weal , Thy peerless chivalry reveal , And gird thy beauteous limbs with steel , Maryland , my Maryland ! " " When I say that , I feel quite sore at the British myself , " said Jeff , who had always thought the song was another sneer at the luckless redcoats . " Aw gee , that 's got nothing to do with the ole British , " said Skinny . " That 's talking about damyankees . " " What the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Clear out of here . " They fled . " You 've got a nice voice , " Skinny complimented his friend as they continued their walk . " It 's a pity they do n't have any singing in Quaker Meeting . " Jeff shuddered at this pagan idea . " I been reading a wonderful story , " continued Skinny , " called Master Skylark , about a kid that could sing and made friends with Shakespeare . That 's the only good thing about having big sisters , you get their old St. Nicholases to read . " " Shucks , the best story ever was in St. Nicholas , " said Jeff , " was A Boy of the First Empire , about a kid that worked for Napoleon . He was a courier and wore a cocked hat . Ride like the wind to Paris ; tell them the battle is won ! ' "  | " I bet Shakespeare and Napoleon were the two most importantpeople ever lived , " mused Skinny . " Gee , I bet they never had their teeth straightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more'n you do , " said Jeff generously . " He was terribly emotional . I think I can understandNapoleon better , he 's more my type . " " Maybe we might go to the Liberry , " said Skinny . " I been trying for six months to get The Hound of the Baskervilles . " " In the National Library of Jeffland there 's fifty copies of every book by A. Conan Doyle . Nobody has to wait . " They turned eastward toward the Library ; their way led them through one of the dipping valleys that carve the city . It was spring 's breeziest weather , the crosstown street was a funnelfor the western gust . As they came down the slope they saw a colored man with a dray backing his horse into the gap of an alleyway . The big wagon was filled with little round bonnetboxesof lilac pasteboard . Evidently they were to be delivered at the back door of a Key Street milliner , one of those famous caterers of finery for Chesapeake belles . Probably the colored citizen was impatient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box-factory . Without pausing to consider meteorology he cut the cord that bound his bulky and toppling cargo . Aeolus was on cue . As the driver let down the gate at the tail of the wagon the entire mass of paper cylinders flew like confetti or toy balloons . The boys gazed in astonishment . In an instant the whole block was a sprinkle of rolling and soaring cartons , some flying in air and dodged by astonished pedestrians , others wheeling on one rim and scuttling like rabbits into byways and corners . The bewildered Negro sprang this way and that , grabbing at his dispersing cargo ; he managed to seize a couple and then stood clutching them , helpless to collect more . The whole covey of flying cardboards now burst suddenly across the intersection of Key Street 's afternoon traffic . Horses reared , a primitive taxi stalled , blocking the trolley track ; ladies screamed , an elderlyp272gentleman from the Chesapeake Club capered along the gutter pursuing his own silk topper which must have been lifted by a fellow-feeling . An alert motorman leaned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cylinder in midair . So many geometrical forms in motion at once were like an explosionfrom the pages of Euclid , but Madame Hyacinthe ( Chapeauxof the Mode ) was not amused . Easter was late that year and so were the boxes . Jeff and Skinny in ecstasy pursued one agile container down the alley . It was unblemished by its flight and they decided to take it home . The Zouaves of Jeffland had long needed a new barracks ; or it would make a perfect roundhouse for the Great Eastern and Western Railway shops in Sprunt City . Jeff had laid first hand on the box so Skinny feared he would not get one , but a passer-by who saw his face had pity . " You poor boy , " she said , " did you lose your boxes ? Do n't cry . Here 's one . It almost knocked me over . " They fetched a careful detour to save their trove . Two or three blocks away they thought it safe to come out on Key Street and at this corner they ran into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would be honorable , Uncle Dan suggested , if they returned the boxes to Madame Hyacinthe , whose name was printed on them in very French script . The statesmen made ingenious argument . " If she only gets back two , " said Skinny , " it will make her feel worse than ever . It will remind her of the others flying down the street . " " I saw a horse put his foot right through one , " said Jeff . " It was cheval de freeze round his ankle like the White Knight 's horse . " " By Sir John Tenniel , " said Skinny , still hoping to distract Uncle Dan . But they returned to Madame Hyacinthe 's , where other good-natured people were also delivering the escapading cartons . No street in the world is more good-humored than Key Street . But the unfortunate colored man had completely disap/peared . Seeing the miraculous and irretrievable dispersion he whipped up his horse and fled . " This season 's bonnets must be rather frolicsome , " said Uncle Dan politely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in the paper about flyaway hats ? " " Such lovely little creations , " said the lady . " I think people are getting tired of great big hats . Now I 'll have to sell them in paper bags . I ca n't get any more boxes printed before Easter . " Jeff had his inspiration . Certainly there was a way they could honestly acquire one . " Aunt Bee needs a new hat , " he said . " And I bet Skinny 's mother would like a new hat too . " " She 's got one , " said Skinny sadly . " I heard them talking about it . Father said Unitarians ought to stick to one color . It 's got botany and cherries . It 's conspicuous , " he added proudly . Choice was difficult . It was the first time Uncle Dan had ever bought a female hat and before decision was reached Jeff and Skinny were told to stop advising and wait outside . They argued happily about it on the way home . " I 'm glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " because that 's the way the boxes acted . " " What kind of a bird is it , " wondered Skinny . " Maybe it 's a bird of paradise ? " " If it 's real , " Jeff meditated , " Aunt Bee wo n't like it . I shall tell her it 's a bird of prey . " The bird was probably not in Audubon , but that was how Aunt Bee got the new hat  --  and the Zouaves their new barracks . Everyone needs reassurance sometimes . When the Major felt like trash  --  " I feel right shabby , honey . Sort of a mizzry in my wits "  --  if the weather was right he abandoned Ma and Pa and ordered out the oriole-colored dogcart . Then there wasp274reassurance in the stable too . Lightfoot would pass along the word , there was skirmishing and flourish in the tack-room , neat's-foot oil and saddle-soap , bath brick and chamois . Cinders , the old groom , was busy with currycomb and hoof-blackingand toothpaste for Dido and Aeneas . Dido was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . The groom 's hissing ( to prevent swallowing dust and horsehair ) acted on Aeneas like a cocktail ; if he heard it first in Dido 's stall he got rambunctious . Then Cinders had chance for special endearment with Dido . " Now , lady , jes ' hol ' still while I wash yo ' mouf . Don ' you curl up no nozzles at me , no 'm . You 's a handsome lady-hoss ef you don ' stargaze , dat hoss hold her haid so high she nevah need no check-rein . Mutual , tie up dem dawgs befo ' dey go crazy , see ef de good whip is coil up pretty , an ' get me out my good cap , dis ' one too whiff to ride with white folks . Jesus Gawd , de whole yand in a flux , Major take tandem to town . " The Major was the last of Chesapeake 's cavaliers who drove his animals to the office  --  and tandem at that . It was only done when the horses really needed exercise , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond him . It was a secret between him and Cinders that after they left Greenaway in a flying sprinkle of gravel , when they reached the valley road , out of sight , the Major turned over the reins to the groom . But he always took them again ( Dido and Aeneas a little chastened by now ) when they came to the broad slope of Key Street Avenue Extended and went spanking down that highway into town . Not even the twin steeds imagined by Plato as rival couriers of the soul were more accoutered in beauty than the gleaming mare and gelding as they swung ( Dido in the lead ) round the wide sloping driveway where Cathedral Station lies in its great bowl of turf . The Major kept his desk at the leisurely uptown depot , not among traffic managers and freight accountants in the company 's office building . He said a railroad man ought to keep company with trains . Clerks , ushers , a dispatcher and an old brassbound conductor off duty lookedp275out from station windows as the Major tightened rein on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prettiest pattern of feet , each hoof with its separate strike of sound . " By God , he slows ' em down as sweet as the Royal Blue Limited , " said the conductor , and an artist in the tower , working on a Summer Tours booklet , tried hastily to do a sketch . Not until the equipage came to a softly chiming halt , and the Major twirled his whip into its lapping spiral , did Cinders relax African gravity . His soot-colored jowl opened white and pink . " Yassuh , Major , mighty pretty singlefoot . Ole Dido sure a pretty hoss . She kin still trot wid de front laigs while de rearquartersslowin ' down . " " I feel that way myself , " said the Major , putting the whip in its socket . The groom gave him a firm elbow to descend from the high seat , then stood at Dido 's head with some confidentialcompliment . Maybe the mare enjoyed a reassurance too . The traditional one , as between groom and thoroughbred , goes something like this : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady 's maid and yo ' rump 's as broad as de cook's. "  --  Aeneas got his kind word too , but Cinders needed none . The faces of the admiring colored porters were his elixir . And the Major , a little lame , moving stiffly up to his office in the tower , reflected that perhaps this was the last great railroadstation that had a right to call its castellated vestibule a porte-cochere . To his good heart the locomotive still really was the iron horse , and the ornate old station was his fortress of romance . If one of the ancient varnished rocking chairs in the waiting-room was empty he often sat there to take the travel off his feet , but also in a godfatherly pleasure of treating the public as his personal guests . Many a lady baffled with children or parcels was surprised by an elaborate greeting from this unidentified hidalgo . " You-all wo n't have long to wait , the train 's right seasonable this morning . Ah 'm glad you toted yo ' luncheon-basket , wo n't have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for once they were not being directed at me . " Vance , " she said , weighing his name as if it had been some commodity she was appraising . " I do n't suppose by any chance you 're related to the Milton branch ? " " No , " he told her , and I thought I saw a faint flicker of amusement in his expression . " My family name was spelled differently . " " Really . " Cousin Eunice peered at him suspiciously . " Yes , " he went on , " it used to be Vancovitch , so you see those Milton Vances would n't claim me . " Cousin Eunice showed her surprise . She was n't used to people with names like that , people who were obviously unimpressed by the sort of background she admired . " Well , I always make it a point to ask , " Cousin Eunice rallied with a shrug . " It 's such a small world , and somehow I never can understand people changing their names , exceptby marriage of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Any relation to the Pratt smelting and iron works in Pennsylvania ? " Again I thought I detected a grim amusementabout his lips . " Oh , no , we belong to the Massachusetts branch , " she told him emphatically . " Well , the world 's so small I thought I 'd ask . " He gave no sign beyond a slightly lifted eyebrow , but I knew he was speaking for my benefit . " I was out there working last summer . " " In the iron and smelting works ? " I could see that Cousin Eunice was growing more disapproving with every remark , and that it pleased him to lead her on .   " Why , yes , in a way . I was making a survey of industrialdiseases . " " Oh , I see , how interesting ! Do you play contract ? " Already Cousin Eunice 's eyes were upon the card table being set up in the alcove . He shook his head and watched her move over to it . I was rather sorry he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deafness did n't interfere with it and I had come to be a good player . I wanted to show him what I could do with cards , and now there would be no chance . The four older ones would have their table , and after Harry and Janice left for the dance I would have this strange young doctor on my hands . Aunt Em was beckoning me over to the table , but I smiled and shook my head . I would n't have kept her from her game , knowinghow she enjoyed it . Janice went over and tinkered the radio . I knew it must be dance music from the way her shoulders swayed in time and from the annoyed frown on Aunt Em 's face . She was trying to catch Janice 's eye to make her turn it off . But before she had managed that Janice had caught Harry by the arm and they had begun to dance . I watched them , indifferently at first , and then with a sudden sense of hurt . They need n't have started in so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening for dancing . " Come , " Harry was bending over me and reaching out his hands . " Come on , dear , here 's one you know : Two I carts in Waltz Time . ' Let 's take a turn . " Yes , I remembered . They had played it that night of the Valentine party . We had danced and danced to it with big red hearts for favors . I was n't likely to forget that tune to the end of my days.  | His arms were strong about me , and though I fumbled at the start I managed to get into the swing . I was so used to following his steps that it was n't as hard as I had expected . I thought we were doing rather well , and I stopped straining to keep the rhythm . As we passed by the sofa I looked up and saw that Dr. Vance was watching us with that frank curiosity that had annoyed me earlier in the day . What annoyed me even more was that I caught a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more to the book he had picked up from the table . I turned quickly to Harry 's face for reassurance . But it was not there . He was given over completely to guiding me , and I knew in that moment that all spontaneity had gone out of our motions . I lost step just then and fumbled in sudden confusion . " Oh , I 'm sorry , " I apologized . " My fault . " " No , mine , " Harry denied politely . " It 's because we have n't tried dancing together for so long . You 're not bad , Emily , really you 're not . " " Well , I 'm certainly not very good . " I tried to laugh it off as I spoke , but could n't have sounded very convincing . " Remember what Dr. Johnson said  --  at least I think it was I ) r . Johnson  --  about the dog walking on his hind legs : the wonder was n't that he could do it gracefully , but that he could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like that , should she , Dr. Vance ? " Harry turned to him after he had motioned Janice to shut the radio off . " We 'll have to get you to prescribefor her when she 's difficult . " It irritated me that Harry should have drawn our guest into the talk , and I must have shown it.  | " You do n't like to make compromises , do you , Miss Blair ? " I pretended not to have caught his words , and there was some satisfaction in making him repeat them . " I hate compromises , if you must know ! " I flashed back . " I hate them almost as much as I do doctors ' office mannersand their puns . " " If I promise never to make any in your hearing  --  " he began . But I cut him short . " In my hearing , did you say ? " " VV ell , what if I did ? " He compelled me to go on with the conversation , though anyone could see that I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention your deafness the way everyone else around here seems to be . " I do n't remember what answer I made , but I went over to the bridge table and stayed a long time watching the players . They did n't guess that the cards were a blur before my eyes . I felt hot inwardly at the bluntness of that remark , even more at the truth that lay behind it . When it was time for Janice and Harry to leave for the Catons ' dance I followed them into the hall , determined to seem gayer than I felt as I watched them drive off . Ridiculous to feel forlorn and left out with Harry 's kiss warm on my lips and the reassurance that he would be over the next evening . Yet I could not shake myself free of my earlier mood . As I closed the front door , I turned and found Dr. Vance standing behind me . " Good night , " he held out his hand . " I 've just been thanking your aunt for letting me come to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " " Again ? " I repeated . " Oh , you mean the North Station . That was n't exactly my idea of a meeting . " pI04 " Or mine . " He shrugged and smiled before he went on . " But as a matter of fact we 'd met before that . " " In some doctor 's office , I suppose . I 've wasted so much time in one or another these last two years I ca n't keep track of them all . " He let the remark pass . " No , " he said , without reaching for his hat and coat , " it happened right here in Blairstown . There was a Christmasparty down at the mills and you stood on the platformholding a little muff about the size of that . " He put his two fists together as he spoke . " You must have been seven or maybe eight . " " Seven , " I told him . " Yes , I remember . There was  --  some sort of trouble , was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little demonstration . He 'd been laid off and he was n't in the mood to appreciate Santa Claus . " Once more he gave me one of his long , disquieting looks . " Oh ! " I said lamely . " Then your father must have been the one who  --  " " Yes , he was the one . Our name was Vancovitch then . They changed it after we left Blairstown . My father 's dead , " he added , " he died of lead poisoning in a plant near Newark . You need n't be afraid he 'll turn up with a grudge . " " I suppose you can carry it on for him , " I said . " It 's just the perfect time for you to come back with all this labor trouble starting . " I saw him flush and knew that my words had hit the mark I meant them to . " I guess I deserved that , " he answered . " I had n't meantp105to tell you . It was an impulse , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to yield to them . " He hesitated before he went on again . " Well , I might as well explain that I came because Dr. Weeks asked me to . We owe a lot to him from years back . He saved my mother 's life , and he helped me through college and medical school . I do n't know any other way of paying him back . " " Oh , " I said , feeling very small , " I sec . " " And there are other reasons , too . . . " Even without hearing the tones of his voice I felt the sureness go out of his manner . " This place never brought us anything but misery and hard luck . It 's come to stand for everything I hated and struggled to escape from , and I knew it would stay like that always unless I came back and gave it the best I have to offer . You have to turn the tables on the past sometimes if you do n't want it to play tricks on you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly I found myself trying to keep him from going . " I 'm sorry I said what I did , " I told him . " I 've had rather a bad day , and I took some of my feelings out on you . You kept turning up , you see , and it bothered me the way you seemed to know all about me . " He scarcely seemed to notice my apology as he stood there looking in at the living room  --  at the firelight on the drawn brocade curtains ; at the flowers and ornaments and books and the family portraits hanging in their places . I could tell that he was taking in every detail in a special kind of way , not like the casual observer . " It 's a funny feeling "  --  he turned to me at last with a ( Buick shrug  --  " being on this side of your front door . When I was a kid I used to pass this house and wonder what it must be like inside . Well , now I 've found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you expected it to be ? " " Why , yes ! " His eyes went back to the room and the group about the card table before they returned to me . " Yes , it 's the way I expected  --  all except you . " I did n't want to press him , but curiosity got the better of me at last . " Oh , so I do n't run true to form ? " " No , " he told me , " you wear your rue with a difference . ' " " My what ? " I thought I must have mistaken the word . " Rue , " he repeated , " in case it matters . You know , Miss Blair , I ca n't help liking you in spite of my disapproval . Good night . " He was out of the front door before I could answer . I went back to the fire and tried to go on with the piece of knitting I had begun . But I kept losing count of stitches , and at last I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dictionary was always kept . I took it down and turned to the r 's . " Rue , " I read , " an herb with a bitter taste ; to lament , or regret . "  |p107IT  HAD NEVER occurred to me that Harry and I could ever quarrel , and yet we did , the day after my return . The afternoon had been beautiful after the rain , and that somehowmade the sharp , barbed words the more hard to reconcile . Everything shone in a late October brilliance that was like a coat of clear lacquer laid on the familiar hills and roadsides . The bright , washed air held a faint edge of frost , and the far smoke of bonfires and a delicate spice of fallen apples mingled with every breath I drew . It was like drinking some rare , ethereal wine , such as gods might have brewed in the days of faith and innocence . I felt renewedas I rode beside Harry in the open roadster . Yesterday'sdespair had fallen away like dried scales . " Harry , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip to the cider mill , " let 's turn off here and walk to the burned-out house . I have n't been there since the day we had our picnic there and you told me  --  " Looking back now , I can see that he had no wish to go there ; but I persuaded him against his excuses . Before we had gone far on the wheel ruts I began to notice changes.  |p108The  scrub oak and elder and sumac bushes had been ruthlesslycleared , and trenches dug in the marshes on either side . I cried out in protest as I had done as a child when what I treasured lay spoiled before my eyes . A rough , unpaintedshack had been set up on the foundations of the ruined house , and workmen 's tools were all about . " Oh , Harry , " I cried , " it 's not ours any more ! " He kept his head turned away so I could n't tell what his response might be . I caught at his arm and made him face me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I always hoped we could own this place some day . I never thought of it being sold to someone else and changed . " But he did n't answer with the fond , reassuring look I had expected . Instead he frowned and drew away his arm . " Oh , do n't be so dramatic about it , Emmy , " he said shortly . " Things are bound to change . " His words were chilling . The brightness of the day suddenlywent out for me though the sun still lay warm on the distant marshes , making broken mirrors of all the little irregular pools . " there was something more than casual annoyance in his rebuke , and because I was hurt I did not let it pass as I should have done . " And people change , too , " I reminded him . " You 're different , I tarry . I 've felt it ever since last night . " " Oh , Lord , if you 're going to get edgy because I did n't know you were coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut him short . " I 'm not getting edgy as you call it . It 's only  --  " I saw his face grow remote and blurred through the tears I was determined not to shed . " It 's only that you seem to bep109holding me off at arms ' length . You wo n't let me get to you any more , and when two people love each other and are going to be married ... You have n't forgotten we 're going to be married , have you , dear ? " I tried to make it light and ironical , but I think my voice must have given away the desperation behind my words . " Now , Emmy , that 's not fair  --  " " But you never mention it any more ? " " Well , how can I ? Look what I 'm making , and look at what 's happening at the mills . It would be a fine time to ask for a raise so we can be married . Besides your aunt has other plans . She 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a lot of luck with cases like yours , and  --  " It came like a slap in the face , and I turned on him furiously . " Do n't you use that word about me , ever again , " I said . " Whatever else you call me , I 'm not a case . There are n't going to be any more doctors and treatments . I told Aunt Em that last night , and I 'm telling you now , so it wo n't do any good to try and humor me along . I 've put through two years it 's going to marry you and be the best wife I know how to be . I have a terrible handicap , and we both know it . But I 'll do everything in my power so it wo n't be too hard for you . It might even make us closer because it makes me even more yours . You do see how it is . Tell me you do , Harry , or I just ca n't go on . 1 ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soothe me.  | " You must n't get all worked up like this . We have to be practical , you know . Calm down a little and be sen-sible . " " I 've tried to be , Harry , but when you start talking about waiting it 's like asking someone who 's starving to wait while you set the table with the best linen and china  --  " " Someone has to think about the dollars and cents . We ca n't live without them , not the way you 're used to living . " That hurt me as it always hurts a woman to be told she 's an expensive proposition . " Just because I 've had everything done for me does n't mean I ca n't get along without lots of things I 've been used to . The only thing I ca n't face doing without is you . We can manage with what I have . I know we can . " " Everything your father left you and Janice is tied up in the mills , and I do n't suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No , I do n't know and I do n't care . With my allowance and what you 're making we 'd have more than a lot of couples start on . " " Please . " I lc pointed off behind the shack and put his finger to his lips . " I think someone 's coming . Let 's not stand here arguing any longer . " I followed him back along the narrow wheel ruts , fightingoff the crowding tears of hurt and humiliation . I tried to tell myself that men were stubborn about accepting financial help from a girl or her family . I had been brought up to feel that this was a trait to be admired . Perhaps I had gone too far with my plans . I had rather flung them at his head , but I had a right to discuss the future that we were going to share . It could n't be a crime to say what onep111felt to the man one was going to marry . Perhaps I had been foolish and impetuous . Maggie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Least said , soonest mended , " she used to tell me . We reached the parked car , and Harry took his place beside me . But his eyes avoided mine and I knew he resentedwhat I had said . The sun was going down behind the broken , roughbackedline of western hills . Soon the sky would be a welterof flame above the dark chimneys of Peace-Pipe Mills . Once there had been a time when the shape of trees and hills and the molten drama of a sun 's exit would have been enough to lift my heart and spirits . But that time was gone . My happiness was bound too closely to the happinessof another to be stirred in the old , impersonal way . I felt baffled and alone as we drove back through the miracle of a fall sunset over a New England mill town . " Harry , " I said as the car drew up by the steps , " do n't feel annoyed with me . I 've been waiting so long for this afternoon all to ourselves , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forget it , Emmy . " He reached for a cigarette and offered me one . But I shook my head . I could n't dismiss it as lightly as t hat . " No , dear , " I went on , " I meant every word I said about us and not waiting . Maybe I ought to have had more pride than to say them . I do n't know what 's become of my pride lately . It just seems to melt away when you lovesomeone . " " I meant what I said , too , Emmy . " He puffed hard " at the cigarette and kept his eyes from meeting mine . " GodpII2knows , you 're a thousand times too good for me and f 1 know it , but  --  " " Oh , Harry , please ! " I cut him short . " I 'm selfish and headstrong and impetuous , but I do love you so . It makes me impatient and stupid sometimes . " He put his fingers over my lips and would not let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garden and the path that led to the made-over stable and the apple trees behind it . Bridget , the dog that young Jo Kelly had presentedme with the day of my engagement party , came rushing out of the toolhouse to greet me . It was comfortingto feel the thrash of her regrettably long tail against my legs and the wet softness of her tongue on my fingers . " That dog , " Aunt Em and Maggie called her , and we had all given up hope of classifying her as to breed . But she made up for discrepancies of appearance by exuberance of spirit and a devotion to Inc that was almost an embarrassmentat times . Everything about Bridget was at variance  --  her body long and rangy ; her coat the silky kind that should have belonged to a lap dog ; her ears drooped limply , while her tail flaunted its length like the banner of some fantasticlost cause . I smiled in spite of my own preoccupation to see her trotting before me through the dusk . Her nose pointed toward the woodyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking back to make sure that I was following . Suddenly I saw her start forward , all wagging animation . She forgot to look back at me , and I lost her for a moment in the dimness . Then I came closer and saw the reason for her excitement . A man was moving about in the woodyard , a shabby figure with a shock of dark upstandinghair . I knew it for young Jo Kelly even though ourp113woodpile was the last place in Blairstown where I might have expected to find him . I could not see his face for the failing light , but I stood behind one of the old apple trees and watched him leave off splitting a big log to bend and caress the dog . She leaped upon him , and even though I could not hear her whines of welcome the pantomime of her joy was deeply affecting . Watching those two , I wondered what it was that he had  --  this power to kindle the affections of a dog , or to stir his own kind to confidence and courage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He possessed some quality one could n't name that made difference of opinion seem unimportant . I was glad that Bridget had led me there just at that moment . I wanted to call his name and feel his thin , quick fingers in mine again . I could have taken comfort talking to young Jo there by the woodpile even though so much had happened in the last two years to send us in opposite directions . But the dusk was too thick to make it possible for me to follow his lips . So I stood there watching him through the gap between crooked apple branches . He was lifting and piling the wood he had split , and I knew as if he had told me that this was his way of helping lighten the work that must be growing too heavy for his grandfather . I knew that Aunt Em worried about Old Jo 's stubborn carrying on of duties , refusing all assistance . I guessed that young Jo must also have the old man on his mind , though they were still unreconciled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead with the sleeve of his coat . Then he straightened his shoulders and stood still a moment looking up towards the house where lights shone yellow in all the familiar rooms . I wondered if he remembered the big carved bed in the sparep114room where he had spent those weeks of convalescence in his childhood , or if he had shed completely our side of the river . I saw him bend to pat the dog he had given me before he swung himself over the fence and disappeared down the back road . Perhaps he was already on his way to talk to some group of workers , to urge them to organize and call a strike as he had done at the last mass meeting . Yet here was the wood he had split and piled to keep our fires burning . So ironic a situation was past my comprehension . But , hether it made sense or not , seeing young Jo Kelly theread given me back for a moment the old happy sense of confidence that used to surround my childhood . It was as if he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to before the river had come to flow so irrevocably between us . Bridget had returned to my side . She kept her nose pressed close to my ankles as I went up the dark driveway . I felt grateful for her warm and living presence . Night always intensified the isolation which deafness had brought . Well I knew the truth behind the old saying : " The day has eyes , the night has ears . "  |p115THE  DIRECTORS of Peace-Pipe Industries always mct on the first day of November and the last day of April , dates which punctuated the year for Aunt Em and Uncle Wallace . I could not recall a time when they had not reckoned happenings as before or after spring or fall meeting . Of recent years my long absences from Blairstown had lessenedthe importance of these occasions for me . This year , however , the November meeting loomed large on the calendar , for the future of Peace-Pipe Industries hung in the balance . None of us liked to admit the seriousness of the situation . But we all knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a walk-out might be called on short notice . Warnings had been given , and the issues could hardly lie dormant much longer . We knew that representativesof the United Textile Workers would present their case to the Board . We knew the demands  --  dropping of the proposed 10 per cent wage cut , reinstatement of certainworkers who had been laid off , and recognition of a local union to be organized by Peace-Pipe employees . We J new , too , what the Directors felt about all these issues.  | They would never make concessions , particularly on the matter of organizing . " It 's the end of Peace-Pipe if we give in an inch , " Uncle Wallace had said plenty of times , and Aunt Em and Mr. Parker and the rest were in complete agreement . " When a company has operated for over half a century it does n't have to be told how to run a business . There would n't be ally mills today without the stockholders ' money , and it 's time some of us took a stand to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like these , I 'd like to know . " " Still , it might be wise to make a few concessions , " Harry Collins sometimes ventured to remind them . " They do n't want to call a strike when business is practically at a standstill . The best time to get what they want is when it 's booming and they can hold you up on orders  --  " " Hold us up , yes , that 's exactly what they 're planning to do . Bandit methods , and you need n't try to cover it up with the sort of talk they use . I 'm surprised , Harry , that you 'll even suggest our listening to their demands . They 've got to be curbed right at the start of things . " " I 'm not taking their side , " Harry would argue , " but I do know we ca n't take care of what little business we have left without experienced mill hands . We have to meet competition , and it 's stiffer than ever right now . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There you go again ! " Uncle Wallace and Mr. Parker always reacted violently to that word . " Compromise  --  it only means giving in by inches , and you ought to know it . Look at what happened at Danforth Mills and Still River . If they 'd had any backbone it would n't have come to wholesale walk-outs and the disgrace of calling for the State militia . We 'll never let it come to that at Peace-Pipe.  |p117The  United Textile group need n't think they can frighten us by waving the big stick . " A year before , even six months ago , I would not have bothered about such discussions . I would not have strained to make out what they were saying about the mills . Now it had become important to me because the state of PeacePipeIndustries had come to have bearing on the future I waited so impatiently to share with I-larry . It was like studying a new language , the terms were so strange ; and I hesitated to show my ignorance . I did n't want to keep asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to follow discussions- that grew heated and full of interruptions . Each person who joined in made it harder for me to follow . I had learned from past experience not to keep asking to have remarks repeated . In the days when I was first struggling to read lips I used to be reminded of the circus jugglers who could keep a number of balls going in the air at once . It seemed to me that to follow the talk of two or more people required as keen an eye and agility of mind . So I read all I could find about the mill activities in the paper , and I questioned Harry whenever he was in the mood to be expansive . Although he came and went as usual and was with us at the dinner table night after night , he and I were alone together less often . At any other time I might have ace-used him of maneuvering it so ; but his interest in the business was genuine , and Aunt Em and Uncle Wallace turned to him with their problems as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and preoccupation , telling myself that I must be patient till after the Directors ' meeting . I began to live up to that date and long to have it over . Neither Harry nor I alluded to our differences of the day after my return . I regretted having been so impulsiveon the subject of our marriage . He must be the first to speak of it . After all , I reasoned , lying awake in my bed , waiting for morning to show between the branches of the copper beech tree by my eastern window , after all there were other matters al important as my own personal happiness . " It will all come right in the night , " Maggie Flynn had always assured Janice and me when we were little and in need of comfort . I had believed her implicitly then , and the habit of faith in tomorrow persisted in me as I think it must in all of us to the end of our days . And so the first of November came round and Aunt Em and the others went down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held in the long privatedrawing room where Janice and the Parker twins and I used to take dancing lessons years before . Board membersfrom Boston would come on the ten o'clock train , and the meeting would last till midafternoon . It was a gray day of low-hanging clouds . Smoke from across the river mingled with the damp and lay like wet dust that could not settle to the ground . " Ugh ! " Janice shivered as we ate lunch together . " Nice cheerful weather , just the kind to put everyone in good humor down there at the Wawickett House . I 'm going to date up somebody and clear out . " I had half a mind to ask her to take me along , but before I knew it she had slipped away in the little car . I had never felt close to Janice , and now more than ever we seemed separated by a wall of cold glass through which we motioned to each other . For all that , I felt a new warmth in her when she was off her guard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her . In the old days she had been gay and casual in all her relations with others . Now she took offense easily ; blazed away at some unintentionalslight , or grew moody and aloof for no apparent reason . Aunt Em had noticed the change and commented upon it . " I ca n't make out what 's come over Janice , " she said . " I offered to send her to New York last month ; but she said she 'd rather stay here , though Heaven knows the child has always complained that Blairstown 's too dull to suit her . If there were any eligible young men about I 'd think she was in love . " I put on my raincoat and walked for an hour through the gray afternoon , with no objective but to kill time and avoid sodden leaves that had washed down from lawns and driveways . Even Bridget seemed affected by the atmosphere . She made no excited foragings with stiffened tail and wriggling body . She stayed at my heels , closer than a shadow . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimlessly through the dampness . It 's no better than doctors ' waitingrooms . I ca n't fit into the old ruts any more or make new ones with Harry . I felt suddenly alien in this town where I had grown up . It was not the refuge I had thought to find in my hour of need . I felt like someone who returns to knock at the doors of the past , only to find them closed . It was in this mood that I came back to find Dr. Vance sitting by the living-room fire . He was the last person I cared to see , and my irritation was plain . That morning I had been sorting out some sketches I had made months before with an idea of developing themp120into textile patterns . I wished that I had not left them spread about on the table , for I saw that Dr. Vance had been studying them while he waited . He held one in his hand as he rose to greet me . " Aunt Em is still at the Directors ' meeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no telling how long it will last . " " I know , " he said ; " that 's the reason I came today . I wanted to see you , not your aunt . " If Maggie had announced him I might have had a chance to escape , but I was caught now . " I took a look at these . " He held out the sketch and indicated the others . " They seemed to be out on exhibition . I take it they 're yours . " " Yes , they 're mine . Am I supposed to ask you what you think of them ? " " Well , since you seem so eager for my opinion "  --  he squinted at the one he held and reached for the others  --  " I rather expected they 'd be worse . " " You overwhelm me . " I rose stiffly and gathered the sheaf into the portfolio . He did n't offer to give back the one he had , so I held out my hand for it . But he took no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one you really pulled off , " he went on . " The design 's good , but it would be more effective if you reversed the dark and light . " His suggestion was right . I wondered why I had n't realizedit before . But I had no intention of letting him see that I agreed . " You 're pretty cocksure about a lot of things , are n't you , Dr. Vance ? " I said . " Maybe . " He gave back the sketch as he spoke . " I neverp121could see much point in saying what I did n't think . Now these things of yours are so good they ought to be a whole lot better . But you never bothered to work them through . That 's the trouble with girls like you  --  " " Just what do you mean when you say girls like you ' ? " I broke in . He shrugged and reached for a cigarette . " Plenty of money , plenty of talent ; good looks , too much doting family and too many distractions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared just then with the tea tray . She seemed pleased that I had a caller . I noticed that she had trimmed the crusts off the sandwiches , an infallible sign of her approval . But I did not smile as she set it on a low table before me . I wished that Maggie had been less eager to offer hospitality . " That goes to the spot . " Dr. Vance held out his cup to be refilled . " I had an emergency appendix to do this morningand a couple of visits out in the country , so I skipped lunch . " I found myself looking at his hands , noticing again how strong and flexible they were , the fingers long , with slightly flattened tips . I could visualize them manipulating some sharp , delicate instrument . In my scrutiny I forgot to watch his lips . " Look ! " He was leaning across the tea table , forcing me to follow his words . " We got off to a bad start again today . Let 's forget it and begin all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be for both of us . I came because I wanted to see you alone . I 'm going to talk to you , and you 're going to listen whether you want to or not . " My hand shook as I set down the cup . I started to rise ,  | and I might have managed to bolt from the room if the tea table had not hemmed me in . " No . " He went on speaking without taking his eyes from mine . " It 's this way . I 'm a doctor ; and if I saw someonegoing round dragging one foot , and I knew I could do something about it , do n't you think it would be a crime if I just let him go on limping ? " " That would depend , " I answered evasively , " on how the person felt . " " You know what I 'm driving at  --  I mean you and your deafness . " " That 's my trouble , is n't it ? I 'd rather not talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if I can help you  --  " " You ca n't . Please just finish your tea and go  --  " Once more I tried to get up , but somehow I could n't force myselffrom the chair . " You ca n't put me off like this . " He was leaning forward , and his face had sharpened with intensity . " Why did you have to come here ? " I hoped my voice was as bitter as the feeling behind it . " Why could n't you leave me alone ? I 'm not asking for pity from you or any-one . " But he shook his head . " Yes , you are , " he said , "  --  not in words , maybe , but there are other ways . When you strain to catch what people are saying , and when you miss something and that look comes into your face , you 're asking for it . " " Why do you say such things to me ? Do you think I lost my hearing on purpose ? " He shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Blair . You must n't con/fuse help with pity , just because you confuse love with it . " I rose and started for the door , but I felt his strong thin hands on my arms as he pulled me back . I wanted to shake them off , yet I was too startled to free myself . He made me look at him while he went on . " You must listen . After that it will be up to you . No , do n't speak . It 's this way  --  I 've helped cure people who 'd been deaf longer than you have . " Once more I struggled to move away , and once more his grip tightened . " It 's nothing you ever tried  --  it 's a sort of discovery another doctor and I stumbled on . I wo n't try to tell you in medicalterms ; you would n't understand them , and besides we 're still experimenting . But we 're not quacks . We 're both full-fledged doctors and we know we 're on the right track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began gathering up my things . I would n't give him the satisfaction of . further argument . Better to ignore the subject , I decided . But I had n't counted on Dr. Vance 's persistence . I felt like the weddingguest who had no choice once the Ancient Mariner with his glittering eye had singled him out for victim . It did n't matter how many times I told him the specialists 1 'd been to and that they 'd all given me up as a hopeless case . He just kept right on telling me more about this discovery of his . It seemed he and this other doctor had come on it accidentally when they were treating some steel workers for gland deficiency . Two of the men were stonedeaf , and after the treatments had been going on for some weeks they began to feel sensation in their ears . " They showed so much improvement that we knew it could n't have been just fool luck , " he told me . " We had something , so we went on experimenting at the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with a group of deaf patients , and I do n't mind telling you we got results  --  three complete cures and definite response in all the other cases , even ones where the auditory nerves seemed permanently dead . We never had a chance to try it where the ears had been affected by meningitis . That 's why , when I heard about you , I thought  --  " " That I 'd make another guinea pig to experiment on ? No , thank you , Dr. Vance . I should think you 'd have known how I 'd feel without asking me . " I saw his face redden at that , and I was glad if I had hurt him . " Many things are lost for want of asking , " he said . " That 's a proverb my father brought with him from Europe . I 've found it worth remembering . " " Well , once and for all then , " I told him , " my answer is No . ' When I came back from Boston that day we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more doctors for me and no more experimenting . I 've come home to make the best of things as they are , and  --  and I have other plans . " " That means you 're going to marry Collins soon , I sup-pose ? " " We 've been engaged for some time  --  " " I know , and long engagements are apt to be risky . " His eyes were uncomfortably keen in their scrutiny . " Not when people really love each other , " I said shortly . " Maybe . I do n't pretend to be an authority on that subject . Still , I 've noticed that being in love is n't necessarily a permanent state . " " Just what do you mean ? " I was n't going to let a remarklike that pass.  | " Oh , only that marriage is the sort of business that demandsall the faculties . " " You need n't have said that to me . " I felt my knees begin to shake , and I pressed my hands tight together so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " he admitted , " I need n't have , but you do n't seem to think much of the pleasantries that successful doctors cultivate . I 'll never be a successful one for that reason ; apt to be on the blunt side . All right then , I 'll finish what I started to say  --  just because you ca n't hear is no reason for you not to see . " He was in the hall , looking for his hat , and now it was my turn to go after him and call him back . " I 've been brought up to say Thank you , ' even for things I do n't want , " I found myself telling him . " I need n't have been rude just because you were . " " It 's all right by me . " He smiled and took up his hat . " Call me any name you want to , only I ca n't understand your not being interested enough to give what I 'm offeringyou a try . There 's nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you I ca n't afford to hope any more . For the last two years I 've been chained to hope . Now I 've broken free , you ca n't make me a prisoner again . " " We 're all prisoners of hope some way or other , are n't we ? " " More fools then ! " " Well , maybe . " He raised his shoulders once more in the expressive , half-foreign shrug . " People called Columbusa fool once , and Pasteur and a good many others I could mention . If you and I hoped a little we 'd be in good company . But never mind , thanks for the tea . " " If I could be sure  --  " I began . He wheeled about and cut me short . " Who 's sure of anything in this world ? " Even without hearing the tones of his voice I was aware of the scorn behind his words . " I 'm not a salesman . I did n't come here to give you guarantees and a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance . Of course you need n't take it . " A car turned into our driveway as he opened the front door . I saw the nearing headlights brighten wet branches to gaunt silver in the instant of passing . Then they fell into darkness again . " Well , goodbye , " he was saying . " My office hours are from two to four every afternoon except Friday , and I can always be seen by appointment . " He was gone before the car drew up at the steps . I felt grateful that I should not have to explain his presence to Aunt Em and Cousin Eunice as they came stiffly up the steps . They looked old and worn in different ways  --  Aunt Em peaked and grim , Cousin Eunice pouting and Baggy and protesting . I was glad to busy myself replenishing the fire and pouring fresh tea . " Aunt Em , " I said , as I brought her a cup , " you look all in . Did you get anywhere at the meeting ? " " We got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grimly betweenswallows . " Began with it and ended with it . "  |p127ON  . THE DESK before me as I write is a small wooden box , painted blue and patterned in quaint , bright designs . The colors are softer than they must once have been , like the eyes of those who have lived long and seen much . Many hands have left their mark upon the wood . The grain shows through in places , especially where the worn brass key fits into the little lock . That small blue box is like no other object in my room though it must be older than ( , Grandmother Blair 's pine chest , or the cherry bureau , older than the glass dolphin vases that came round the I fora by barkentine . The box , also , has crossed stormy seas . The hands that fashioned it and traced the delicate shapes of hearts and birds and flowers would have faltered , perhaps , in the laying on of those clear colors if they could have guessed how far their handiwork was to travel . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand for allat we shared together in those months after my return . I remember the first time I saw it incongruously set between a card index and a prescription pad on the top of a battered desk . It caught my eye because it seemed to be127 the one personal touch in the office Vance had fitted up for himself in a back room of Dr. Weeks ' shabby old frame house just off the Square . " I wo n't give in and let him experiment on me , " I had vowed , resolutely turning about-face whenever I found my feet taking me in that direction . " I wo n't be fool enough to go through all the misery and disappointment again . He need n't think he can make me . " But all the time I knew a day would come when weaknesswould overtake me . Try my best , I could n't put what he had said out of my mind . " You must n't confuse help with pity , " he had told me , " just because you confuse love with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love ? He could n't mean that pity had any part in what Harry felt for me . Yet perhaps he saw what my love and need of love would not let me see . " Just because you ca n't hear is no reason for you not to see . " He had said that , too , and I wished that I could forget it and the look that he had given me as he spoke . " Being in love is n't necessarily a permanent state . " I tried not to let myself remember those words and others that tormented me like thorns driven inward upon my mind and heart . " Marriage is the sort of business that demandsall the faculties . " I knew that he was using my own fears as a means to break down my resistance to his plan , and I hated him for it . Yet for all my antagonism to the man himself I could not doubt his sincerity . He knew the vulnerable spot in me as surely as if his long fingers had touched a hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I was power/less to resist them . I hated him for having let drop those pebbles of doubt and fear into the deep pool of my consciousness . They had stirred ripples that spread and widened to engulf me as ripples will grow large long after the object that woke them has disappeared from sight . And the more I struggled against his offer of help , the more certain I became that I should find myself accepting it . Sitting here alone at my desk , thinking back to that time and all that I felt for Harry Collins , I am shaken by the memory . For it is a memory now , not the frantic , feverish urge that goaded me then . Love , when it comes for the first time , has the fierce and bewildering beat of spring in its pulses . Such ecstasy and despair are not to be reckoned with in terms of sanity and reason . The foolish and wise are equally at its mercy . Let no one doubt its power to exalt or betray , for it can rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we were not meant to endure its rigors for more than a brief span . I am grateful to be free of its toils . Yet when I see that it has laid its bright , infallible mark upon some boy or girl , some man or woman , I feel a kind of inner comradeship . The terrible , sweet pain flows back , though the one whose presence could once inflict it is a stranger to me now . But I must return to the small blue box . There I was , reaching out my hands to it for comfort , in that bare , plain office I had avoided so long . Across the desk I knew that Dr. Vance must be watching me with satisfaction , because I had not held out against him . It was my place to open the conversation , to explain my presence there after so emphatic a refusal . I turned the box about in my hands , tracing the design self-consciously with cold fingers while I tried to summon the words that proved to be unnecessary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to me then , that some insignificant object will become foreverlinked to our extremity . We must recall the exact shape of a leaf whose shadow fell across the blind of a sickroom ; the scroll on the handle of a spoon our fingers gripped in the numbness of despair , the lace that edged the handkerchief we pressed to our lips to hide their trembling . I studied that little box almost without being aware of what I was doing . Yet the shape and colors of that painted design will stay with me as long as memory itself . It had been done with the same intricate , tender care that went into the fashioning of some medieval missal book , yet it also suggested a prim valentine . Two hearts held the center of the lid , with a painted needle and twist of thread joining them together . Stiff birds and spotted butterflies hovered at the corners , and a flowery garland encircled the whole . There were initials below the lock and fine lettering in a script I could not read . One felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box . A sense of other lives seemed to radiate from the very grain of the wood , as if one could feel the hands that had held it reaching out and touching one 's own in turn . I looked up at last , though my hands still held the box . " Well , " I began lamely , " here I am . " The eyes that met mine across the desk were intent , but kinder than I had ever seen them . To my surprise I saw that Dr. Vance was not gloating over my capitulation . " So you like my little box , " he said , as if it were the most natural thing for me to be sitting there in his makeshiftoffice . " It happens to be my one and only family heirloom , and I 'm rather attached to it . "  | " It 's very old , is n't it ? " I did n't know what else to say . " I think so . My mother always said it had been in her family . It held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes she 'd let me play with it , or my sister , if we 'd promise to be careful . I can remember seeing my mother take it in her hands , the way you did just now . I used to watch her and wonder why her eyes would look the way they did when she held it . I know now it took her back to the old days when she was young and the prettiest girl in her village , before she had to worry about winter and coal for the fire , and Father getting laid off and one or the other of us sick or needing something she could n't give us . " " What do the letters say ? " I asked . " It looks like a motto . " " It is , " he told me , " in Lithuanian that I ca n't read . But my mother told me once what it means  --  that 's where the needle and thread come in . It says , Love is like the eye of a needle . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had to explain it to me . The eye of a needle is a small thing , she used to say , but without it we could make nothing to keep us warm against the chills of win-ter . " " Why , that 's beautiful ! " I found myself touching the letters that neither of us could read , in sudden recognition . It was as if a long procession of other women were speaking to me across time and space in some universal language . " Then you believe it 's true ? " he asked . " Of course . Do n't you ? " " 1 have n't had a chance to prove it yet . "  | " Everything ca n't be proved . " I was surprised that I could talk this way to a man I hardly knew , one who had antagonized me from our first meeting . " Some things you just feel first and prove afterward . " He gave me one of his swift reassuring smiles . " And you were the girl who wanted a guarantee that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " I admitted , " there are times when it 's not easy to live up to what we believe . " I was provoked that I should be giving myself and my feelings away like this . I certainly had n't lived up to my plan of keeping the visit a cool impersonalone . He must have felt the change in me , for before I had a chance to go on he leaned across the desk and spoke earnestly . " I 'm not asking you to believe that I can help you , " he was saying , " but only that I want to do it . " " All right . " I did n't trust myself to say more . " When do we start ? " For answer he rose and left the room while I waited , as I had waited in other , more handsomely furnished offices . " There 's still time to go , " I reminded myself as I measuredthe few feet of space between me and the hall door . I could be outside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved a fraction of the way to the next minute . Yet I knew that I would not go . And then he was coming towards me , carrying familiar paraphernalia . " Oh , " I said , " an injection . I 've had plenty of those . " " You know , " he said as he handled his instruments , " it 's a funny thing , but you 've never asked me whether it would hurt or not . I 've been expecting you to . "  |p133It  was my turn to shrug . " Do I have to do everything you expect me to ? " I asked . " Besides , " I added , " pain was n't the point , was it ? " " No , but it 's a usual question . " He gave me another of his direct , searching looks . " I 'm going to ask you to give me your word that you 'll see this through , " he said . " It may take longer than either of us can guess , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't you trust me ? " " Not altogether . " I saw his eyes turn to the window that looked towards the mill chimneys and the span of the upper bridge . " I come from over there , " he went on . " That 's where I really belong , and I do n't feel sure of myselfor you or anyone else on this side of the river , except of course Dr. Weeks . " " My mother came from over there , too , " I found myselfsaying . He nodded . " I know , " he said . " I used to hear them tell about her when I was little . She 's a sort of legend , like the Cinderella story that girls who are plain and lonely and overworked have to believe in or they could n't keep going . I never t bought I 'd be talking like this to her daughter . " I thought that it was even stranger that I should be there , letting him do what I had vowed I would never submit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come here ? " I said bitterly . " Do I have to take some kind of oath on the Bible or one of your pet medical books ? " He held the needle up to the light and squinted at it before he answered.  | " All right then , " he said . " Let 's not be melodramatic about it . You 're here , and I 'm ready to begin . " I reached for the little blue box , and he smiled to see me do so . " That 'll do instead of a book , " he said before he went to work . Afterward I walked in the fall sunshine trying to forget that the old disturbing routine had begun again . Well , I had given my word , and I would keep it . I would not miss a visit , but he need not think that he could make me hope against all my doubts and prejudices . I hardly noticed where I was walking till I found myself halfway across the bridge where I had stood so often as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those years ago . " Do n't worry , " she had said . " You 're safe on your side of the river . You 're all Blair . " But I was n't all Blair , and I did n't feel that I belonged anywhere in particular . Had my mother felt so sometimes , I wondered . Had old differences , old standards , and old loyalties overwhelmedher time and again as she stood where I was standing now ? Surely it must have been so , though she had not had to stand here alone . A man 's arm or a child 's clingingfingers must make one feel more secure , I thought . Or did they twist the heartstrings into a more difficult , intricatetangle ? I should never know that now . The small blue box , for all its association with another woman , had given my mother back to me in a new image . I realized that for years I had confused her with the portraitof a beautiful woman in the ruffles and pompadour of two decades ago that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush had also made a legend of her even as Vance had said she was a legend to the people livingp135over there in the crowded mill houses , to girls who tended bobbin and loom . It came to me then that I must be part of the legend , too , because I was her daughter . Perhaps they hated or envied me for that . I thought of the Christmas party for the mill workers that winter day when a man had sworn and shaken his fist ; of a half-grown boy who had stared curiously at my little squirrel muff , and remembered it years later . It made me feel suddenly lonely and afraid . " It will be different once Harry and I are married , and we will be married just as soon as this trouble at the mills is over . " It comforted me to tell myself that , even though I knew that the mill trouble had only just begun . From where I stood I could see a line of shabby figures , three or four men and a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now they were there . They moved mechanicallybecause it was easier than standing still on tired feet . Harry had told me that they were union supporters who had been dropped from the pay roll . Other workers were being dropped each week while the deadlock between the union and the mill grew more bitter ; while futile negotiations went on and on without either side giving way on a single point . I could see the white placards they carried on sticks . When one or another of the picketers turned to reverse pace I could even make out a word or two : " Organized Labor , " " Rights , " " Unfair . " " Most of them do n't like to picket , " Harry had told me a few days before . " It 's a protest now , but it 's going to be a lot more than that if the union decides to call a walk-out . " So I turned back , but I could n't put those distant figures with their white placards out of my mind . It ought to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk with that little group . Yet I knew they would have distrusted such a gesture of camaraderie . Instinctively they would have thought there must be some motive behind my coming , and we should all have drawn back into our separate shells like cautious snails . It would only have ended in our talking about the weather , that safe conversational refuge to people who are on their guard . Even if one of them had been young Jo Kelly , I could not hope that it might have been otherwise . Only children , I thought , can play and talk together without this self-imposed constraint . And even children 's eyes are quick to note the difference between a patched sweater and a squirrel muff . They recognize the outward symbols and are more wary than we guess . I found myself wondering when I had first been made aware of the invisiblebarriers that are so much more formidable than those of brick and stone and barbed wire.  |p137JANICE  AND I seldom saw each other except at mealtime , and even these meetings were apt to be occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the child eats , most of the time , " Aunt Em had sighed in the early days of my return . " I always seem to meet her going out or coming in to get ready to go somewhere else . I 've given up asking questions . " " Oh , " I reminded her , " Janice has always been on the go . That 's nothing new . " I had given the conversation no further thought . For years now Janice and I had moved independently of each other except for occasional clashes , or when we rallied our forces to put through some mutually dreaded family gathering . So it was a surprise to find Janice alone in the living room that afternoon when I returned from my first visit to Dr. Vance . She sat hunched in a corner of the sofa with a fashion magazine open beside her . But she was not absorbed in its pages . She looked limp and woebegone , and I saw that she had been crying . " Janice , " I said , dropping down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Has anything happened ? "  |p138She  shook her head and pushed back a lock of moist , fair hair . " Is it something I can do anything about ? " I tried again . " You can let me alone ! " She frowned as she spoke . " 1 guess I have a right to be unhappy sometimes , have n't I ? That 's not just your own private privilege . " She lowered her head , and there I sat , so close that my skirt brushed hers , yet cut off completely as I always was when people turned their faces from me . I waited a moment before I touched her shoulder . " What do you mean by that ? If I 've said or done anythinglately  --  I have n't meant to be difficult , honestly I have n't . " " There you go getting personal . " I could scarcely followthe words because her lips were quivering . " But you said  --  " I broke off and tried again . " I 'm sorry , Janice ; I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , all right , let 's leave it at that , and do n't start trying to cheer me up with the Into each life some rain must fall ' line . I 'm not in the mood . " " I do n't feel in the mood for quoting either . But I know how it can be sometimes . I really do know , Janice . " " You ca n't know because you 're you and I 'm me . You 're considered an admirable character , Emily . " " Well , you need n't throw it at me like that . I certainly do n't feel admirable most of the time . " " Oh , " she shrugged , " you know what I mean . You 've got resources and strength of character , and people depend on you . " " And I suppose you think it 's been easy . " I felt suddenly bitter and hurt as if she were accusing me of being a prude . " I suppose you think I 've enjoyed being cut offp139from everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out what people around me were saying ? " " I did n't say it had been easy , Emily , so do n't get touchy the way you always do if anyone mentions your deafness . I only meant that at least people give you credit for keeping your chin up . Now me  --  I 'm supposed to be the life of the party when there is a party ; and when there is n't one I 'm expected to be happy and have fun  --  in a nice way , of course . " " But , Janice , " I protested , " you have everything  --  " " That 's what you think ! " she broke in . " But do n't get the idea that I always act the way I feel , or that I like myselfmuch . If you want to know , I hate myself . " " Well , I do n't think there 's anything very strange about that . Most of us do a lot of the time . " I tried to comfort her because I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all need someone else to make us know we matter . I know I could n't have gone on if it had n't been for Harry ; there would n't have been any reason to . I tell myself it must have been meant that Harry and I should meet and fall in love just when we did  --  before this happened to me . It frightens me sometimes to think how different it might have been  --  " She gave me a long , startled look , and her eyes were dark with misery . " Do n't , Emily , " she said , " do n't say that . " I was touched and surprised by her solicitude . " It 's because I 've been miserable and lonely , too , " I went on , " that I can tell when you are . It 's  --  it 's sort of like the least common denominator in arithmetic , somethingshared by both . I ca n't explain very well , but you must know what I mean . "  | She did not speak , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love , " I told her . " That 's all that 's wrong with you . " She gave me another of those startled looks , then turned away so quickly that I only half caught the words on her lips . I could n't be sure , but it seemed to me that she said , " Oh , God ! " before she got up and began gathering togetherher scattered possessions . She gave an unusual amount of care to collecting her hat and coat and bag . I remembered that long afterward because it was n't like Janice to be so methodical . She kept her eyes from meetingmine , but I saw that her hands shook as she folded her gloves . After Janice had gone I stayed on in the living room thinking of what she had said while I watched darkness swallow up the lawn and the beeches and maples . It had been disturbing to come so close to what was on Janice 's mind , as if a door had been opened a chink and then shut quickly again to hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the window might well have supposed that we two were exchanging intimate confidences , yet those few broken words had left me baffled . The misery I had seen in her face was no momentary mood of boredom or futility . I found myself remembering Janice as a child , what a nuisance she had been , always borrowing and breaking or losing my playthings , telling tales on me , and getting in the way of my plans . Still when her curved red mouth had drawn down forlornly and tears had gathered in her dark eyes I had always forgotten my annoyance and tried to make her smile again . Lightheartedness was her gift , and she wore it like a ribbon in her hair . No matter how 41little we shared in common or how we might disagree , I could not bear to see her wearing sackcloth and ashes . Presently Maggie appeared in her trim black and white to switch on the lights and set the rooms in order for the evening . I watched her moving about with the same unhurriedprecision that had been part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not notice me till she came over to pick up the magazine Janice had let fall to the floor . " I did n't know you were in , Miss Emily , " she answered my greetings , " or I 'd have brought you a cup of tea . It 's not too late for one now if you want it . " But I shook my head . " Maggie , " I said as I watched her putting things to rights , " what 's happened to all of us in this house ? " " I do n't know what you mean except some of us are n't getting any younger , and the same can be said for these sofa cushions . They 're a disgrace , and I 've been after Miss Blair to do something about them for months back . " " I did n't mean the sofa cushions , Maggie . It 's just we all seem unhappy and pulling away from each other . Even Janice does n't have a good time any more . She was crying when I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Maggie reached for another pillow and shook it vigorously into plumpness . " Well , I expect she 's got reasons of her own . " She moved over to the table and began sorting out magazines and newspapers . Conversation with Maggie never meant suspended action . If necessary one followed her about to continue it . I had a feeling she wished to avoid more questions , but I was determined not to let the subject drop . " Maggie , " I began again as she started for the hall , " you know more about all of us in this house than we know about ourselves , but you never take advantage of what you 've heard or seen the way some would . It 's more than just being well trained ; it 's a sort of gift you have , almost like second sight . " " There 's nothing to it , " she protested with an uneasy glance under my scrutiny . " Nothing out of the way , I mean . I guess anybody that 's worked thirty-eight years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never listened at keyholes or read what was n't intended for me , but I ca n't help knowing things . I guess it 's just people do n't remember I 'm around , that 's all . They get used to me along with the furniture . Except they need me for something I might be that sofa or chair . " " Have n't you ever wanted to go away or try another place in all these years ? " I asked curiously . " Why should I ? I 'd just be doing the same things somewhere else . " I looked about the familiar high-ceilinged room and beyondher to the long hall and the other rooms opening from it . " It 's a big house , " I said , " as houses go . But is n't it rather a small place to make a world of ? " " Oh , I would n't say that , Miss Emily . " She gave me one of her rare smiles , as if I were a little girl again asking her foolish questions . " World or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All I ask is I do n't live to see it break up in front of my eyes . " " You mean if this trouble at the mills gets worse  --  " " Now , Miss Emily , do n't take my word to mean anything . I 've got to get back to the kitchen now and help with dinner . "  | " You 'll never join a domestic workers ' union , Maggie , I can see that . " I laughed . " You do n't believe in closed shop for kitchens , do you ? " " And do n't you give me any of that union rigmarole round here , " she retorted . " There 's a few of us left in this town that have n't seen fit to go on strike . I should live to be told how many hours a day I 'll work ! " I rose and patted her shoulder . " I guess Uncle Wallace and Harry wish there were more like you down at Peace-Pipe , " I told her . " It looks had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't come just now to delay my wedding . It 's hard to be patient when you 're in love , Maggie , and when things keep coming in between  --  " " I expect so , Miss Emily . Not that I know much about it first hand . Love 's one kind of broom that never swept tnc off my feet . Maybe I 've missed a lot  --  plenty of tears anyhow . There ! " She broke off and pointed to the nearest window . " Mr. Harry 's been at that curtain cord again . 1 lardly a week goes by I do n't have to pick out those knots he ties in them . If I met them in Jericho I 'd know he 'd been fidgeting around . " " I 'll pick them out . He does n't know when he does it , Maggie , he has so much on his mind . " She opened her mouth as if to speak , but evidently changed her mind and turned away . When Maggie disapproved of anyone or anything you could tell by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if she were treading on the unspoken words of criticism . " Watch out for Maggie when she stalks , " I had told 1 larry once , and I could n't help thinking of that when she disappeared down the hall.  |p144I  HAD NOT EXPECTED to meet young Jo Kelly comingdown the Doctor 's steps a few days later as I turned up the path . But there he was , and there was I with Bridget leaping between us in frantic greeting . He smiled at me across her brown , excited body . " Hello , Jo , " I said . " I 'm glad to see you , even if Bridget does n't give me much chance to say so . How do you think she looks for a lady going on five ? " He bent to pet and examine her with that reassuring touch that made all animals his no matter who their official owners might be . " Pretty fair , " he answered in the slow-spoken way that was so easy for me to follow . " Better since you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was getting a bit too fat . " " The same ca n't be said of you , Jo . " He had always been thin , but now his boyish slightness had settled into gaunt maturity . His eyes were as blue and candid as I remembered them under their dark brows ; but his cheekbones showed too prominently , and his mouth was firmer and less merry . AND NOW TOMORROW 145 " Oh , I 'm all right , " he assured me . " I just stopped by the Doctor 's to get some medicine for a friend of mine . " He patted the sagging pocket of his shabby Mackinaw and glanced towards the window of Vance 's office . " Blairstown'slucky to get some one like him , " he went on , " young and up to the minute in his line . They mostly stay in the big cities . " In his manner there was nothing to suggest differences of opinion or constraint between us . He was , as he had always been , completely without self-consciousness . Watchinghim , I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him from other people . It was a positive rather than a negative quality that gave him the power of which he seemed least aware . It is strange to remember now how we stood there by the Doctor'ssteps and talked together . The November wind came up from the river with an edge on it that made one feel winter at the bones though the sun shone through bare branches of maple and elms . Change was in the air about us as it stirred behind our talk . I often think back to that day and the words that wove back and forth like shuttles carrying the frail threads of thought between us to make a pattern which it was beyond our power to alter . " Oh , Jo , " I found myself saying , " why do things have to be this way ? Do you have to stir up all this trouble at the mills and work against us and talk as if we were crim-inals ? " Ile hesitated before he answered , and he kept on strokingthe dog 's coat with those thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me all wrong , Emily , " he said , and I was glad that he called me by my first name in the old familiar way . " I was afraid you would . I ca n't work up hard feel- ings for any of you folks . I 'm on my side of the fence and you 're on yours , that 's all . " " But , Jo , ca n't you look over the fence and see our side ? " " That goes for you , too . " He gave me one of his long , slow smiles as he spoke . " Still , I guess I ca n't expect you to see very far . " " Why not ? There 's nothing wrong with my eyes . " " But you 've always had this thing they call security . You 've never known what it was to wonder where your next meal was coming from , or a new pair of shoes or a place to sleep nights  --  " " Maybe not , but there are other kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean . Still , you try doing without a few of those things I mentioned and you 'll understand better . You 'll know what we 're fighting for . " " There wo n't be much sense to higher wages and shorter hours if this strike of yours ties Peace-Pipe up all winter . What business there is will go to other mills , if ours has to shut down . " He shrugged and straightened his thin shoulders . " Well , I do n't blame you for seeing it that way . Stockholders are bound to feel differently about it . " They take the biggest losses when times are bad . " I found myself bringing out all the arguments I had heard Uncle Wallace and Mr. Perkins and Aunt Em use . But they seemed suddenly inadequate under Jo Kelly 's direct gaze . " Sure , " he answered , " and they take the profits when it 's the other way round . Do n't forget that part . " " But , Jo , it 's always been different at Peace-Pipe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ever profiteered . You know it 's one of the best run mills in New England and it 's done everything for its workers  --  look at the Infirmary and Recreation Building , the night classes , and the band concerts in summer . Our family 's always tried to take a personal interest . Why , Aunt Em 's worryingright now about what she ought to do for Christmas . Even with this strike talk she does n't want to give up the food baskets and presents . She says there 'll be all the more need , and she wo n't let her own feelings stand in the way ; only it 's against her principles  --  " " She means all right , Emily . " His forehead puckered into the lines I knew so well . " Your aunt 's one of the finest ever . That 's why I wish she did n't have to get so hurt about this . But Christmas baskets and recreation buildings and night classes are something else again . Ca n't you see we do n't want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we love  --  " He broke off and bent over Bridget again as if he found it difficult to get out what he was trying to say . I lost his next words and had to ask him to repeat them . " I beg your pardon , Jo , I did n't quite catch what you said . " " No matter , " he told me . " I have n't got any business talking about love . " " Why have n't you , Jo ? Why should n't people talk about loving and . being loved ? This trouble at the mills has n't made things any easier for Harry Collins and me  --  If anyone had told me I 'd have to go on waiting likeis  --  " I broke off , not trusting myself to say more . He turned to me with such quick sympathy in his eyes that I felt almost as if we were children again . It eased me to have spoken the words . We met once more on the old footing of our childhood , when we had shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said simply , " real sorry . But do n't worry about waiting . The way I figure it , you have to wait or fight for things that matter in this world . " " I guess so , " I managed to answer . " It 's the only world we know anything about , after all . " I tried to smile and he did , too , but neither of us made much success of it . We stood there a moment without speaking ; and I saw that he was looking away , over towards the mill chimneys , and his face stayed grave and set . " No , " he went on at last . " It is n't conditions we 're fighting for . I guess they 're fair enough as mills go , and it is n't just the pay and the hours either . But we 've got a right to organize  --  it 's our only guarantee for the future . Whatever anybody says about this union , it means a hell of a lot to most of us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued , snatching at what I had heard from this one and that . " A union ca n't bring prosperity back overnight or make the public want to buy what mills like ours are making . There are too many doing business , Uncle Wallace says . That 's what makes all this cutthroat competition . " " That 's true , " he admitted . " But give us a chance and maybe we could prove a unionized mill could do better for both sides . Ever hear of collective bargaining ? " I shook my head . " How would I hear anything ? " I reminded him bitterly . " No one goes out of the way to explain things to me . It 's too much trouble . See those sparrows over there pickingup a crumb here and another one there ? That 's how itp149is if you 're deaf . You just have to pick up what you can , and you learn not to ask too many questions . It annoys people . " " Well , at least you try to understand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your side of the river . Now take this collective bargaining . Suppose you got in a tight place some time and needed a lawyer . You 'd want to be able to hire one , would n't you ? Sure you would . It 's the same thing , sort of-I 've got a grievance , so I go to the foreman or maybe somebody higher up about it . Maybe I get listened to and maybe I do n't , but it 's a pretty safe bet I get laid off at the end of the week . Too many waiting to step into my shoes . Well , that 's where a union comes in . I tell you we 've got to stand up for the ones that are gettingbad breaks , not just in Peace-Pipe . I mean the ones behind the machines all over everywhere . " " It sounds all right , " I told him , " if it works . But Uncle Wallace and the rest say it 's plain highway robbery the way the unions are holding them up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what 's the use ? I 'll never be able to know who 's right and who 's wrong . I try to understand , but even the words do n't make sense . I 'm not sure I know what a scab is exactly  --  " " A scab . " Young Jo smiled suddenly in spite of our seriousness . " Why , that 's just another name for a strikebreaker  --  sortof polite way of saying the other fellow steals your pants while you 're in swimming . Do you get me ? " I had to laugh too , and I was glad to break the tension . He could care enough to fight for something he believed in , and still joke about it . He had n't changed his ways , andsomehow that was a comfort to me.  | " Thanks , " I said , as I turned to go up the steps , " I 'll remember . " He grinned , but before he moved away he came closer and touched my arm . " How 's Grandpa ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him last time I got sight . He wo n't speak to me any more , you know , and I kind of worry about him down there all alone . " " Oh , " I explained , " he 's about the same . His rheumatism'sworse when it rains . But he sleeps at the big house now . He did n't want to move up , but Aunt Em and Dr. Will made him . It seems queer to have those rooms over the old stable empty after all these years . " " Thanks , " he said . " I 'll feel better about him nights . If he ever  --  " He broke off and shrugged helplessly . " But I guess it would n't do any good to send for me . He thinks I 'm a mad dog biting the hand that 's fed us . I wish he did n't have to see it that way . " " So do I , " I said . " I 'm glad we met . It did me good to talk to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I guess we all need to remember old times no matter what happens to us . " " There were no other patients waiting , so I went on through the connecting door to Dr. Vance 's office . " Your aunt 's asked me for Thanksgiving dinner next week , " he said , looking up from his preparations . " I thought I 'd better find out if you had any objections before I accepted . " " Why should I have any ? " " I do n't know , but you might . It 's hard to get under this veneer of politeness of yours . "  | " Politeness ? " I smiled . " I 've been more rude to you than anyone I 've ever met in my life . " But he shook his head . " Let 's call it honest , ' " he corrected . " I think you are that down here ; but up at your place I 'm never quite sure . You 're still making your curtsies and speeches the way you 've been taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you pretty hard when you were little , or they would n't come so naturally to you now . You put me in mind of something I read in a book once when I was a kid . It was about Marie Antoinette going to the guillotine , and how she stepped on the executioner 's foot and begged his pardon  --  " " Are you comparing me to Marie Antoinette ? " He smiled at me sheepishly . " Well , you belong to the royal family of Blairstown , do n't you ? " " And just where do you come in ? " I asked . Resentment flooded me in a hot wave . I felt it brighteningmy cheeks , blurring my eyes . The jab of the needle brought me to my senses , and his face suddenly cleared before me . He was no longer smiling , and his eyes had that dark intentness which had first made me notice him that day in the station . " Just where do I come in ? " He was repeating my question . " Darned if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STRIKE 15 past history now . I suppose it will never be reckoned of importance to industrial history , for it was a poor one as strikes go , ill timed and insignificant . But for Blairstown and for us it marked the end of an era , as if a page had been turned forever on a familiar way of life . Just now I rummaged in my desk and found a sheaf of newspaper clippings neatly sorted and labeled . The print is already beginning to fade , and the paper growing brittle though the dates are so recent : December , 1931 ; January , February , and March , 1932 . Our strike seldom made the front-page headlines of Boston or New York ; only local papers carried full day-to-day accountsof its progress . I have been trying to reread the columns of print over again , but the words mean less than the scenes and faces that crowd my memory . " You 'll never get it straight , Emmy , " Harry said impatientlyonce when I questioned him about some issue . " Ca n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have never quite understood all the intricacies involved ; the bitter issues ; the compromises that each sidep153proposed only to be rejected by the other in the long battle that was never won  --  that has turned Blairstown into the ghost of a prosperous manufacturing center . Some claim that it was already doomed and the strike mercifully shortenedits slow decline . Others believe that the industry was deliberately betrayed and tricked into its own suicide . No one can say with certainty , least of all I , caught in the crosscurrents of family loyalty and sudden awareness of another way of life . Something I could not define was stirring in me in those months , feeding on my own loneliness and frustration . For the strike was somehow a symbol of my own inner conflict ; as if I had become a human counterpart of the bridge which joined the two sides of our river without ever making them one . " I do n't see how this could have happened to PeacePipe , " I said to Harry the first day I looked across and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke curling from them . " I thought it was only talk . I did n't believe that words could do so much . They wo n't make the wheels of a mill go round . " " No , but they can stop them , " he reminded me simply . Harry Collins had criticized many things about the policy and product of the mills long before the strike threatened . He had argued for a compromise on the union demands at the early stages of negotiations , but when it came to the final test he sided with the Directors . " At least we have n't been disappointed in Harry , " Uncle Wallace told Aunt Em . " I wo n't deny I was worried about his attitude awhile back . From the way he talked I was afraid he might be turning radical . But he 's got too much good sound sense to be taken in by that sort of talk . "  | " I thought we could count on Harry , " she agreed . " After all , when he and Emily are married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His future 's tied up with PeacePipe , and he knows it . " " Maybe we should give the boy more chance to try some of his ideas about putting out a cheaper line of goods , " Uncle Wallace went on . " Parker and I have held him back , but maybe he 's right and we 're in a manufacturingrut . Once we get clear of this mess we might let him branch out a bit . How 'd that suit you , Emily ? " I smiled and nodded my assent . But I could n't let them guess that Harry seldom confided his ambitions to me , business or otherwise . I tried to let them think all was well between us because I had to believe it was . Always when we were together there was that subtle constraint , but when we were apart I could make excuses for Harry . I could convince myself that he loved and needed me as I loved and needed him . It 's different with a man , I would reason ; he does n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps I should never have found out how wrong it was of me to do just that if the strike had not happened when it did . Against my will I was made aware of it . It dominated the town like a cloud , larger and darker than the smoke one which had always hung over Peace-Pipe . Although I was shut off from sound and the normal exchange of talk I felt the change all about me . I saw bitternesstighten men 's and women 's lips ; I saw hunger and fear in their eyes . Even the groups of children at their games moved less freely , as if they reflected something of the grimness and dared not give themselves completely to play.  | I shuffle through the clippings on my desk , and the familiarHope Abandoned " ; " Mill Di , Union and A.F. of L. Representatives in - Deadlock " ; " No Compromise , CompanyOfficials Reaffirm " ; " Union Issues Ultimatum " ; " Walkout in 24 Hours As Truce Period Nears End " ; " Strike Called for Tomorrow " ; " Oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Workers Assured Police Protection As Company Prepares to Reopen " ; " United Textile Union Pledges Support at Mass Meeting " ; " Eighth Day of Blairstown Strike " ; " Sixteenth Day of Strike , " and so on . I hardly need the words to recall those days . They will be with me always because I was part of them . Even now , a year away from it all , I can not forget the picketers by the mill gates or huddled for warmth close to the fires that burned in buckets , idle men waiting to take their turns . I can not forget the women with shawls and empty shopping bags who stood patiently for hours where supplies were distributed ; the half-grown boys and girls who haunted the railroad yards and tracks to pounce on an occasional scattered nugget of coal . I can not forget seeingchildren fighting over discarded wooden crates and bits of kindling wood , dragging what they had salvaged home on sleds after the first fall of snow . I know that there were longer lines than these in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1932 . I read about them in the papers between appeals to the public to spend more liberally and hasten the return to what was optimistically called " normalcy . " But I did not see those jobless with my own eyes . And there was this difference  --  hunger and cold and resentment were new to Blairstown . There had been hard times before , but not this twilight of dogged bitternessas the days went on and on . Janice showed more interest in the mill situation than I had expected . Indeed she was almost vehement in her sentiments , denouncing the workers wholesale till we all lost patience . It seemed in some strange way to have become an issue of personal concern to her , though it was months later that I learned the reason why . " Good Lord , Janice ! " Harry said one night at dinner after she had finished a particularly violent outburst . " You 'd better shut up and cool off . " " What do they want anyway ? " Her soft lips hardened , and she tossed back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much out of life as you and I do . " It surprised me to find myself answering her . " The trouble is , " I went on , " it 's so easy to say they . ' We 're they ' to the mill hands , and they 're they ' to us . That 's when we stop being real people and turn into classes . " I broke off , having said more than I had meant to , but if I had risen up with a hammer in one hand and a sickle in the other I could not have startled the group about the table more . " Nell , " Janice exclaimed , " I must say Emily sounds like a union agitator or Jo Kelly out on his soapbox ! " " And I say you girls better stop talking about what you do n't know the first thing about , " Harry reproved . " It 's bad enough having to take the strike and the talk all day at the mills without getting it served with dinner . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Uncle Wallace , who of course agreed . Aunt Em showed more tolerance than I had expected ,  |p157but  her bewilderment and concern were hard to see . She had hoped for a miracle right up to the walk-out , and she continued to pray for some impossible settlement that would satisfy both sides . " You must n't take the mill trouble so hard , Em , " Dr. Weeks told her a week or two after it had started , when he stopped in for a cup of tea one afternoon . " Strikes seem to be the order of the day now everywhere , so you need n't feel it 's a disgrace . In fact it 's like an industrial epidemic breaking out all over the country . Might be a good thing in the end , I suppose , but the symptoms are pretty pain-ful . " " It 's what lies behind the symptoms , Will , " she pointed out . " As a doctor you ought to know that 's what matters . " She looked stricken in those days , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose lives had gone into the building of Peace-Pipe . It hurt her to feel that the long record of harmony between mill owners and mill workers had been broken . " We always felt personally responsible for our workers , " she told me over and over again . " Any family in need was free to come to us for help , and we did what we could , either from the mill funds or our own pocketbooks . " " I know , " I would answer . " But nowadays I guess peopleprefer their own pocketbooks . I mean "  --  I groped to recall what young Jo Kelly had said on the Doctor 's doorstep  --  " they do n't want to be done for if they can do for themselves . " She looked at me as if I had struck her a blow . " Why , Emily , " she said , " you do n't mean to tell me you think they 're in the right about this strike ? " I sighed and shook my head.  | " Oh , Aunt Em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I think ? I do n't know where I stand any more . I wish I 'd listened more when I could ; but it 's more than just hearing ... . I 'm trying to find out how they feel about it , that 's all . I ca n't help wondering how it would be if I worked down there the way some of the girls and boys I went to high school with are doing . And after all , Mother was a mill hand before she married Father . " Aunt Em stiffened at that . I realized that I had made a mistake to link her name with the present . She and my father belonged to the past that had taken on the mellow haze that removed it from present-day reality and vexing problems . " Your mother was a very unusual woman , Emily , " Aunt Em reproved me gently . " If she were alive today I have n't a doubt she 'd feel worse about this trouble at the mills than any of us . " I wished that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I said no more . " I 'll get Harry to talk sense to you , " she went on presentlyas if she were distracting a child from playing with some dangerous toy . " It 's hard on you both to have all this trouble on your minds when you ought to be making your wedding plans instead . I 'd hoped to see you two married right after the New Year . We could do with a little festivityin the family for a change , and I 'm not at all sure Harry 's right about thinking it would n't look well at a time like this . " " You 've  --  been talking to him about it lately ? " I felt my throat tighten , and I hoped I did n't sound too eager . " Why not , dear ? I 'm worried about the mills , but that 's a small thing compared to your happiness . I ca n't changep159this  --  this terrible handicap you have to meet , but at least you need n't go on waiting . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of place , but Harry does seem to feel we should n't make plans till the strike 's settled . . . " " I suppose you offered to give us enough to live on ? " " Well , why should n't I ? There 's enough for that even if most of what we have is tied up in the mills . But there 's some insurance of your father 's that your Uncle Wallace and I always planned to turn over to you and Janice when you married . With that and what Harry makes you two should be able to manage . I told him that , but he seems to have a lot of pride about accepting anything from us . I do n't altogether agree with him , still I have to admire his attitude . " " I would n't care where we lived , " I told her . " Those rooms over the old stable are just going to waste now old Jo 's moved up here to the big house . They would n't be half bad with fresh paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk it over . You can convince him if anyone can . " She smiled at me and turned back to the letter she was writing . But her remarks had made me restless . Personal concerns forced the mill trouble into the back of my mind . I decided to go down and have a look at those rooms again before the light dwindled into December darkness . I pulled on my old leather windbreaker and started down the path with Bridget pressing close at my ankles . It was windy and chill outdoors . Bare branches were raking dull skies and the winter sun looked like tarnished silver in the west . Yet a glow of anticipation warmed me . It took so little to set me planning in the shy , determined way thatp160no woman can resist . As I came in sight of the stable and the windows showing square and blank above , I saw them not as they were , but as they might be , gay with curtains of flowered chintz , and yellow-paned with lamplight . I felt for the key that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let myself in at the door that opened on the small kitchen . Everything looked mute and impersonal in its ordered bareness though the simple furniture that Old Jo and his grandson had used for so many years had not been removed . Oilcloth was on the table and thick blue and white china in the cupboards , even an old almanac hung between stove and sink . The small sitting room beyond was more cheerful because the late light slanted through the western windows . I stood in the center of the worn carpet with Bridget beside me and studied every detail . It was a small but well proportioned room with built-in shelves that alreadyI saw filled with Harry 's books and mine . A Franklinstove would replace the old airtight iron one . I could fairly see the firelight on my desk and favorite chairs ; on Grandmother Blair 's pine chest and the cherry bureau that was the color of russet apples . Yes , I decided the place between the windows would be just wide enough to hold it . I moved over to make certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically straightened the window shades . " Well , " I said to myself , " that 's funny . " There were knots in the dangling cords , and it took me a moment to realize why I had noticed them . Then I remembered how I had picked out just such knots from the curtain cords in the living-room windows only a short time before . " Mr. Harry 's been at those cords again , " Maggie hadAND NOW TOMORROW 161p161said . " If I met those knots in Jericho I 'd know he 'd been fidgeting around . " Her words came back to me as I stood there alone in the deserted room . I told myself it was foolish to think twice about such a trivial thing , and even more foolish to take the time and trouble to pick them out . It was almost dark when I had the cords free of the last one . I hardly glanced into the small adjoining bedroom as I hurried away , lockingthe door behind me.  |p162THE  STRAIN of the mill situation was beginning to tell on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that he too looked tense and tired . Peace-Pipe had been shut down for ten days though negotiations still continued in the hope that some means of reopening might be found . Every day of bickering was time lost on the orders still waiting to be filled . There were few enough of those , but contracts were contracts and business must be kept , what there was left of it . " Harry ! " I hurried over to meet him by the door , but I could tell by his look that his mind was anywhere but on me and the questions I had been wanting all day to ask him . The eagerness and joy I had felt at sight of him slipped away before his preoccupation . " You 'll have to get along without each other for a day or two , Emily . " Uncle Wallace touched my arm to draw my attention to what he was saying . " Harry 's going to Boston with me tomorrow . " " Oh , do you have to go ? " I protested . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he teased . " Your unclep163needs me to go over figures with some men at the bank there , and I must say I sha n't mind getting away from Blairstown for a bit . You do n't know what it 's like down at the mills these days with the machinery stopped and pickets everywhere you look . " " It 's not very cheerful round here either , " I reminded him . " I 've a good mind to go to Boston myself . I might have more chance to see you there than I 've had here lately . " He smiled , but shook his head emphatically at the same time . " This is business , " he told me , " and you 'd better get used to the idea of not tagging along . I 'm not joking , " he went on ; " it 's serious business . Money 's tight everywhere , and we 've got to convince our backers we 're a good bet for another loan . " " But Peace-Pipe does n't have to borrow money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what it amounts to , " he admitted . " The banks have always controlled a certain amount of the stock , but we 're going to need more to tide us over this . ... Even if the mill can get under way again by January  --  and it does n't look too promising right now-we wo n't break even this year , to put it mildly . Do n't worry and screw up your forehead like that . It 's not becoming . " It was no use asking him more questions . He resented having to explain what he believed I could never understand . I felt like a child being told to look pleasant , please , and be seen and not heard . It was n't so much his impatiencethat hurt me . I was used to trying people 's patience , even Harry 's . What hurt me was that he seemed relieved to be going away while I must get on as best I could till his return . I sat beside him on the sofa . His arm was about me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? I thought . What has come between us ? I do n't matter to him any more . There 's no use pretending to myself that I do . He must have felt me shiver , for he patted my shoulder . " Cold ? " His lips formed the word carefully , so he would not have to repeat it . I shook my head . " No . I guess I 'm just missing you already , dear . " " I 'll be back before you know I 've gone . " How could I tell him what had chilled me ? I wanted him so much , too much . Other girls , other women loved other men , and they had not waited as I had through interminablemonths and years . Love was never meant to be like this , dammed up in oneself because the floodgates were locked from the outside . The pressure was growing too heavy for me to bear . Why could n't I say to him simply and honestly : " Harry , you do want me still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or I ca n't go on , for nothing has meaningor reality for me except you . " But I knew why I could not say those words . I was afraid  --  afraid of losing what I had by asking for more . He shifted his position and pulled himself up . " Well , I must be getting back , " he said . " We 'll be taking the early train tomorrow , and I must pack before I turn in . Besides , I have to pick up some things I left over at the Parkers ' . " " You 'll be roped into cards , " I told him . " Janice is over there now . They wanted me to fill in , but I knew they 'd put me at a table of misfits . " " Well , I 'll only look in for a minute , " he said . " Gladp165you warned me . Goodbye , dear . Get a good rest . You look tired . " " That means I 'm definitely not at my best , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps . But I knew he would be up late at cards . The twins would see to that . I wished suddenly that I had gone even though I hated pretending to enjoy myself . So I turned back to the living room feeling as deserted as it looked . The fire burned in cheerful unconcern of empty- chairs about it . Aunt Em and Uncle Wallace had both gone to their rooms , and Bridget and I were left to keep each other company . It was half past nine , and I must hunt for the detective story I had begun yesterday . I did n't care who had killed the adventuress in the night club ; but no matter , it might make me sleepy to read awhile by the fire . I do n't know how long after that Bridget roused herself from the rug and stood listening with lifted head . I always knew when someone was coming by the way her ears pointed and her throat rippled making the rumbling warningsI could not hear . She moved towards the hall , and I rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the door , I saw a man coming up the steps , and I recognized Merek Vance . The light over the entrance shone full on his face as I let him in . " Sorry , " he explained . " I would n't have bothered you so late , but I 'm having car trouble . My engine stopped dead just below your drive , and I ca n't get it started . If I could use your telephone  --  " " Of course . " I let him into the study . When he returned presently , he shrugged and frowned . " I ca n't get any answer , from the garage , " he told me . " The man on duty must be out or asleep , and the hotel says they ca n't say when they can send a taxi . I wish Dr. Weeks was n't off in his car . I 've got an emergency call our on the Ridgeville Road . " " You can borrow ours , " I said , " if Janice did n't drive it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't bother with protests or further explanations . " It would save a lot of time and sometimes minutes count . " " I 'll show you the way , " I said , and caught up my coat . It was dark going down to the made-over stable , but I knew every inch of the way . He held my arm , and I could feel the firm grip of his fingers and his breath warm beside me in the cold night air . " Here . " I saw with relief that the little roadster was in its place . " The keys are probably in . She usually leaves them . Yes , she did , thank goodness . " I felt for the light switch and turned on the ignition . I could feel the engine begin to throb and , as it started , a sudden impulse overtook me not to go back to the house . He took his place behind the wheel , but instead of getting out I turned to him . " Let me go , too , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know the car better than you do even if I do n't drive it any more , and I can wait while you make your visit . " " Well "  --  I could just make out the motion of his lips in the light from the dashboard  --  " I ca n't say how long I 'll be . Your family wo n't worry ? " " They 'll think I 've gone to bed . Please do n't make me go back to that book I was trying to read . I wo n't be a bother to you , really I wo n't . " He nodded and began backing the car out . He stoppedp167for a moment by his own to collect his bag , which he set on the floor between us . I could n't help thinking that no matter how the times and methods changed , those limp , worn leather bags were the universal badges of the medicalprofession . Instinctively I would have distrusted a doctorwho carried a new , shiny one . The very scratches and stains and rubbed places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortal combat . It was strange to be riding beside Merck Vance at such an hour in the little car that had taken me on so many pleasure jaunts in the past , that must always be associated with that summer of my engagement to Harry before my own personal disaster . A car , especially at night , with everything dark but the round , luminous dials and the beams of the headlights , may become a complete small world to those inside it . We take on its dimensions as if it were our larger shell . Its power seems to come from ourselves . It seemed so that night as we put the town behind us . The air rushed by , sharper for the open country that lay beyond the range of our lights on the pale cement of the road ahead . I could not see Merek Vance 's face clearly . He was a shadowy shape in the overcoat that smelled faintly of wool and tobacco and other scents I could not classify . His hands held the wheel with an easy grip . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing what he said , and if I had spoken to him I could not have read his answer in the dimness . So for a little while there was no need to talk . I found myself thinking back to my first meeting with Merck Vance . It was strange that I trusted him as I did in spite of my prejudices . Though I would not admit it to myself , I had come to count on those visits to his barep168little office to break the monotony of days that were empty and meaningless as days have never been before or since . It was well into December by then , nearly two months since the treatments had begun . At first I had been afraid of detection , but no one took notice of my walks with Bridget . Our family intimacy with Dr. Weeks made it seem a natural thing if I happened to be seen entering or leaving his place . He , of course , knew the reason for my coming . But he asked no questions and I could trust him to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered the telephone and helped with patients was equally trustworthy and closemouthed . Dr. Vance saw most of his patients in the evening or at the hospital clinics , so that I met few . I had no more faith than I had had the day of my return that he could help my hearing . He knew that and did not try to convert me . We had given our word to each other , and once the bargainwas made he would keep to his end of it . He made no personal issue of the experiments , only now and then his eagerness betrayed him as he went through the routine of tests in the hope of some sign of improvement . And there was this to be said for Merck Vance : he did not put me off with excuses or avoid conversation because my deafness made it difficult . He continued to be frank , almostruthless about my hearing . " Deaf people strain too much , " he told me once , " except for the ones who pretend they hear when they do n't . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear , and the other half does n't bother to do anything about it . " " And what about you ? " I cornered him . " Oh , " he shrugged , " I 'm a doctor . I need n't remind you what you think about them , though I could , for I happenp169to have a good memory . But honestly , now , think back a few years : slid you ever really listen ? " " Of course I did , " I insisted . " And I would again if I had the chance . " " I doubt it . " He shook his head . " And I 'm not setting myself to be better than average when it comes to that We none of us hear all we might . "  |p170FROM  THE MOMENT we set out in the car something outsidemyself seemed to take me in hand . I had a sense of being in a play , given a part to act in which I had not been rehearsed . Mine was not an important role in that drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember it well . We turned off the main road into what was hardly more than two wheel ruts . Presently I made out the shape of a house dwarfed by the larger shape of a barn behind it . Four squares of windowpane were yellow in the darkness , and someone must have heard the sound of our engine , for as we came to a stop a door opened and a man 's figure showed sharply in silhouette . Merek Vance reached for his bag and got out . He came over to my side and motionedme to join him . I had expected to stay in the car ; but there was no chance for argument , so I followed him to the door . After the cold night air the room in which I found myself seemed crowded and stifling . It was evidentlythe kitchen of a farmhouse , for a large coal stove filled one side and a sink with a primitive sort of pump thep171other . I remember a table covered with a red cloth , set with thick dishes , and people about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old woman with a sleeping baby in her arms ; a half-grown boy bent over a book , and a littlegirl of three or four who stared at me over the shapelessform of a rag doll . The man who had let us in scarcely noticed me . His eyes were fixed on Merek Vance , and he talked so rapidly that I gave up trying to read his lips . I felt sure that he must be speaking in broken English , and that was almost impossible for me to follow . From his stocky strong build and his quick gesturings I guessed that he might be Italian . Vance 's back was towards me , so I could not tell what he might be saying as he removed his overcoat and warmed his hands at the stove . He must have made some explanation of my presence , for the old woman looked up and nodded as she eyed me curiously . She motioned to the boy to give me his chair . I smiled uncertainly as I took it and beckoned the little girl to show me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apron for it , the two men went into another room and were gone some time . I felt as if I had been suddenlyset down in a foreign country , completely cut off from communication except by gestures . Once or twice the old woman addressed remarks to the old man or boy , but I could make nothing of them . The little girl had lost her first shyness . She let me set her on my lap . She was not pretty , but neatly made and charming with her dark eyes and clear , pale skin . I had not held a child for so long that I was startled by the light firmness of her body . I could feel the delicate bones under her dress and her heart beating quick as a bird 's when you hold it inp172your hands . She found the bright flowers on the scarf I had tied over my hair , and I marveled at the gentle curiosityof her touch . So intent were we that I did not see the door open until she turned quickly and slid from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in with Vance , and tugged at her skirts , holding up the doll with my handkerchief and making shy motions in my direction . The womandid not turn at once because she was listening intently to Vance . Something about her caught my attention im- . mediately . I could see that she was young and slight , and the droop of her shoulders showed that she was very tired . Her hair wrapped her head in smooth blackness , and the line of her throat was long and graceful . Even without seeingher face I could feel the intensity of her listening and speaking . Then she turned , and I recognized Angeletta Rossi , my old classmate , the girl who had won all the debates and played the lead in high-school plays . I had n't thought of her in the seven years since we had marched up to receive our diplomas and the class history had predictedthat I would paint pictures and she would win fame on the stage . We stared at each other across the cluttered room , and I knew that she must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began awkwardly , " I did n't know you lived here . " " Why should you know ? " I had no difficulty in understandingher as she flung the words to me over the child 's upturned face . " Why should you know ? " she repeated with a defiant lift of her shoulders . " We 've gone an awfullong ways since Blairstown High . Well  --  " The spirit died out of her face that had grown sharp and pale , though the features were as I remembered them  --  clear-cut and ar/resting . " Well , I ca n't blame you for what 's happened to me . " " Mamma ! " I caught the word on the little girl 's lips . " Is she yours , Angie ? " Angeletta looked down at the child and nodded . " This one , too , " she said , and pointed to the baby in the old woman 's lap . " And the one in there  --  " She broke off , and her eyes went back to the door of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who must be her husband had just come . I saw her face grow peaked as she spoke , and she looked at Merek Vance in a way I ca n't forget . I turned to him , too , for I could n't go on staring at her . He met the question I did not put into words . " Yes , " he told me from the sink , where he had poured out a steaming basin of water from the kettle . " The little fellow in there 's pretty sick . If I could have got him over to the hospital yesterday or even this morning  --  " He broke off with an expressive gesture . " What is it ? " " Infection of the middle ear . It 's spread to the mastoid bone . " He was rolling up his sleeves as he spoke . " I ca n't take any chances with the temperature he 's running . " " What are you going to do ? " " Open it . Operate . " " Here ? " I glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wo n't be the first time I 've done it , or the last . Look , have you got a flashlight out there ? I left mine behind when we changed cars . " I asked no further questions but went out to fumble in the pocket of the car . Luckily I found the flashlight under a clutter of maps , driving gloves , and old letters with directionsscrawled on the envelopes . As I hurried up the path I had a sense of being part of that house which I had never so much as passed till that night . The lighted windows were no longer bright , impersonal panes of glass to me . Some new and powerful force joined me to those rooms and to the people in them . When I returned to the kitchen it was already a changed room . Merek Vance had taken it over , and the freshness of outside air blew in through an open window . Chairs had been pushed back against the walls . The old couple , the baby , and the little girl were gone ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy was busy pumping and carrying water from sink to stove while the man with the stocky body and dark face was scrubbing furiously at the bare wood of the table where the red cloth and dishes had been . Vance still stood at the sink , turning his head from one to another . I could not follow what he said , but I knew he must be giving directions from the way they moved and listened . Standing there in the doorway , like a spectator at a play , I felt suddenly useless and afraid . I looked down at my hands holding the flashlight and they seemed oddly inadequate . What good could they do in such a crisis , I thought . What had they ever done except hold pens and paintbrushes and unimportant parapher-nalia ? Just then Merek Vance noticed me and came over . " Good ! " He nodded as he saw the light . " You 'd better not stay around if you 're the kind that faints easily ; but if you 're not . . . Want to help ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I touched my ears to remindhim.  | " You wo n't need anything but your hands , " he reassuredme . " Think you could hold the light steady for me ? All right , I 'd rather not ask Mrs. Gallo ; it 's hard on a mother  --  this sort of business . . . She 's keeping up well though . Funny you should know each other , but I 'm glad you do . Maybe you can talk to her while I 'm in there with the boy . She 's under enough strain without seeing him take the anesthetic . Lucky I have enough to see us through . " Angeletta came back presently bringing sonic aprons over her arm . Vance selected the plainest one of the lot and put it on as unconcernedly as if it had been his white surgeon 's coat . He moved with unhurried precision , settingout the contents of his bag on a clean towel . " Angie ! " I reached out to take the apron she handed me , a cheap cotton print covered with incongruously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would choose not to wear on such an occasion . " Angie , " I tried again lamely , " I 'm so sorry ... " Her eyes met mine with a glazed , expressionless look as she reached to help me put it on . I hoped I could make her feel my sympathy , but it was hard to find words . " You do n't mind my being here , do you ? " She shook her head and bent to fasten the apron strings . " Because if you do  --  I 'll keep out of the way . I 'd never have barged in like this if I 'd known ; but now I 'm here Iant to help . I guess there is n't anyone wants to help more than I do because the Doctor says the trouble 's in his ears , and I 'm deaf , Angie , did you know that ? " " He told me . " She jerked her head towards Vance , who was standing over the stove , clouds of steam rising about him from the heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | I followed her into the bedroom beyond . It was untidy and badly lighted . Bedclothes and garments seemed to be everywhere , and the large sagging bed was only half made . In a crib beside it I made out the small shape of a child whose head showed round and dark against the pillow . His face was turned away , but I saw the rapid rise and fall of his chest before Angeletta bent over him . A crucifix and rosary beads hung from a nail on the wall , and a candle in a red glass cup burned under a likeness of the Virgin and Child above the bed . Although it was a poorly painted flimsy bit of tin the little shrine lent a kind of dignity to the room . Angeletta , bending over her child , took on the ageless quality of an old master in terms of living flesh so that she seemed the personification of all women of all time . Seven years ago last June , Angeletta and I had marched up the aisle to receive our high-school diplomas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar doors were closing behind us , yet flushed and eager , too , becauseothers were opening on what was going to be wonderful  --  maybe . Angeletta had been eager and lovely that day with a kind of glow under her skin , and her eyes big and bright as a child 's on Christmas morning . I guess I must have looked that way , too , though it 's hard to tell about oneself . Well , we would never be like that again , that much was certain . In her shapeless house dress and with her anxious gaunt face Angeletta looked years older than I. She was poor , but she was alive as I knew I had never been in those years between . Life had stirred in her , and through her it was going on to be part of the endless procession of the future . So much had happened to her while I had stayed tight-rolled as a bulb in the security of somep177dusty shelf , away from the rains and the frost , from the magnetic forces of earth and sun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling as we stood in that shabby room . But she would n't have listened or believed me . I knew , without her saying a word , that she was envying the comfort and security that mattered so little to me . The little boy 's head burrowed into the hollow between her breasts . Her thin , strong arms t ightened about the curve of his body . I flattened my own against my sides that I might be less aware of their emptinessas we waited there together . But I had no more time to think or feel , once Vance summoned me to the kitchen . " You need n't look , " he told me . " Just stand here by this knothole on the floor board and keep the light as steady as you can . " I took my place , grateful that I could become a pair of hands , nothing more . Though I was aware of the figures about the table , I did not look at the faces or try to follow the motions of lips . Even the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me than Merek Vance 's hands in their tubber gloves reaching for this or that instrument . I marveledthat they could move without a tremor or a second'scsitancy . The cloying smell of ether grew stronger as the moments passed , and steam and more potent scents mingled with the heat from the kerosene lamps . I saw a thin line ofred widen as the scalpel took its course . I had never guessedthat there could be such sure precision as this that I sawwith my own eyes . The flashlight seemed to weigh more each moment . I ached from the effort of holding it steady . My hands felt numb , and I must ease now one hand , now the other . That circle of light became the only reality to me , and at last even Vance 's hands were blurs . I clenched my teeth and set my feet more firmly on the reassuring hardness of the floor . Then I lost even that sensation . My whole body and mind were projected into that clear beam of light that I must keep from wavering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room suddenly cleared about me . The man and the boy were lifting the limp figure , and Angeletta was wheeling the crib in to receive it . The floor was strewn with soaked swabs and cotton , and the sheet that covered the table was no longer white . Merck Vance was standing by the sink peeling off the gloves he had worn . I still held the flashlight , but suddenly my hands began to shake so that it fell to the floor . It must have made a loud noise , for Vance looked up and nodded to me across the room . Just that and nothing more , yet the gesture reassured me as no words could have done . His face , under a shining mask of sweat , looked sharpened with weariness . I found one of the kitchen chairs and sank down in it gratefully . I was trembling by that time , not only my hands but my knees and lips as well . It amazed me to see how methodically he went on with his washing , and how he gathered up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine . My experience with doctors had been confined to hospitals and offices with modern equipment and able assistants at hand . The sort of disciplineand skill that could meet emergency alone in the kitchen of a run-down farm was something I had never encountered till that night . I had stood at the edge of a mira/cle , and even so I could not altogether credit what I had seen . Vance was through with his scrubbing and sorting at last . But there were still directions to give , and he would not leave till he made sure that the child was reacting favorably . Angeletta came out from the bedroom with him when it was time to leave , and , l saw him pat her shoulderreassuringly . As he turned to put on his coat she looked about the kitchen for me and then came over . " I 've got to thank you , " she began , " for what you did . I wo n't forget it  --  ever . " " Oh , it was n't anything , . Angie ; anybody could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could help , and he 's going to be all right . I 'm sure he is . " I saw the muscles of her throat working , and I knew that what she was trying to say came hard . " I 'm sorry I acted the way I did , " she began . " But seeingyou sort of brought things back . I wanted to make something of myself once and do things that count  --  " She broke off and looked about the kitchen before she threw out her expressive hands in a futile gesture . " Do n't feel that way about it , Angie , " I told her . " Those things that we thought counted then do n't seem so much to me now . " She gave me a long searching look . " I always thought you had it easy , " she said , " but I guess I was wrong . I can see you 've had it tough , too , in your way . Well , goodbye . " " Goodbye . " I took her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon to see how he 's getting along . " i kept thinking of what she had said , as I sat besidep180Vance on the drive back . I was glad that the bitterness had gone out of her face ; that we were friends once more and she no longer made me the symbol of what she had missed in life . I remembered the rich clear tones of Angeletta'svoice from high-school dramatics , and I wondered if the warmth and sweetness had gone out of it along with her freshness and bloom . " We 've gone an awful long ways since Blairstown High , " she had said , and I could n't deny that . But it was something that we could still find each other and talk , not as two untried girls , but as one woman to another . I had Merek Vance to thank for that . It was strange that it should be so ; that I must ask him to tell me more about Angeletta who had sat beside me and shared confidences through those other years . I felt his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew what I had been thinking . It seemed the most natural thing in the world for him to do that , and the quick , light pressure of his fingers made me know that all was well . The hands of the clock on the dashboard pointed to a quarter past two . The little car had no heater , and the winter air came in at every crack and crevice . It felt not only cold , but leaden as if it were weighted down with the coming day . The stars were still out , but their brilliance was dulled by early morning damp . It was that interval before the tug of the sun begins to be felt in the east . Even though I could see nothing beyond the straight beams of our headlights I felt that we were trespassers , as if the earth were half resentful of those who were not dead or asleep . Just before we reached the town limits the lights of an all-night diner loomed ahead like a cheerful beacon . I feltp181glad when Vance turned the car into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth chattering , as I got out and followed him inside . The crude brightness of the diner and its heavy rich smells of coffee and frying food were exactly what I needed at that moment . The glaring nickel fittings seemed actually beautiful to me as we sat down at a small table . It was empty except for the man behind the counter in his spattered white coat and two men who were hunched over another table at the far end of the narrow place . Vance ordered coffee , and we drank it eagerly from thick white china mugs . I could see the color coming back into his face as he relaxed over the hot drink . His hands were steadier than mine as he lighted our cigarettes . " You 've certainly got grit , " he said after he had taken a long puff . " It 's a little late to say Thank you , ' but I want to , especially for not fainting . " " You said I was n't the fainting kind . I had to prove it . But tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right ? " " Unless there are complications  --  yes . I 'll run over at noon and see how he 's coming along . He 's a tough little fellow , fortunately , except for badly infected tonsils which we 'll have to watch . I suspect they made the trouble , and of course if I 'd been called earlier it would n't have been necessary to operate . But it was the only chance he had . " " Would he have been deaf if you had n't ? " I asked . " No , " he told me simply , " he 'd have been dead . The infection spreads fast with children . It would have reached the brain . " " Oh , " I said , " I did n't know . I could only think about is cars  --  because of mine , I suppose . " The coffee was thawing my chilled body and nerves . The whole excursion had been so strange that it seemed the least strange part of it all to be sitting at a quarter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadside diner with Merek Vance . I had n't felt so alive and at nw ease in weeks  --  years , it seemed ; and I knew with a queer conviction over which I had no control that I should alwaystrust Merek Vance after that night . In little ways he might irritate me ; we would disagree often , of that I had no doubt ; but in the essentials he would not disappoint me . His very ruthlessness was no longer something to be shunned . I recognized it now for the steel beam that keeps the whole structure of a house in place . I was at a sudden loss for words though I felt a deep inner gratitude flow out towards him across the white-topped table . " Are you ever afraid , " I asked , " when you start to operate , the way you had to tonight ? " He did not dismiss the question as foolish curiosity , but considered it thoughtfully between puffs of his cigarette . " Well , I ca n't say I relish it , " he admitted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always rather leave the cutting to some one who is . I can do it when I have to , and it 's the only way sometimes . They 'll have a drug perfected soon that will check about 90 per cent of the mastoid and strep ' infectionsat the start . It 's going to revolutionize treatments when it 's ready . " His eyes took on new life and light as he spoke , and the tension and weariness was draining out of his face as he went on . " That 's what really interests me : preventive medicine . " " I suppose there 's a cure for everything under the sun , " I said , " if it could be found . " " That 's a pretty large order , " he reminded me with a smile . " Back in medical school one of the professors alwaysbegan his lectures on mental and nervous diseases byp183saying , Give me any plague but the plague of the heart . ' I forget where the quotation came from , but that was the gist of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they 've found the answer , and maybe they have  --  " He broke off and shrugged expressively . " But you do n't agree ? " " I have n't the right to express an opinion because I could never meddle with people 's minds and brains . I 'm mortally afraid of that , more than cutting living tissue or sawing bones . Besides , I have n't the knack of drawing people out . I get out of patience and show it ; funny too , when I 've got more patience than most for laboratory work and experiment . I always say , " he smiled again as he put out his cigarette , " if you can talk to patients you 're a doctor ; if you can get patients to talk to you  --  you 're a psychiatrist . " The food we had ordered arrived just then , and nothing ever smelled more delicious to me than those plates of crisp brown bacon and golden scrambled eggs . The pile of butteredtoast melted before our hunger . We did not speak again for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my appetite . He ordered more coffee and leaned back contentedly in his chair when our plates were cleared . " Funny thing , " he said , " your going over there with me tonight . Of course I did n't know what I was in for when we started , or I 'd never have let you come along . It was queer , too , your knowing the mother back in school . I 'd have thought she was years older than you ; but she 's had a hard time of it  --  the husband was laid off at the mills months ago . He told me he 'd go back as a strikebreaker if he got the chance . His people own that farm , but they 're likely to lose it any time , I gather . They 're the kind thatp184never get ahead somehow , like my father and mother  --  different race , but the same type . I can recognize it . " I found myself telling him of Angeletta and the school plays ; of her striking looks and her ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I talked it seemed as if he were studying me more than listening to the words I said . I broke off in the middle of a sentence and cornered him . " Why do you look at me like that ? " I asked . " What are you thinking about me ? " He shrugged , but he did not hesitate . " I was thinking what a pity it was you were n't born poor , " he said . I opened my mouth to protest , but he went on before I could stop him . " I do n't mean just the money part  --  it 's more the little comfortable rut of easy prosperityyou were born into , that you 'll be going on in if you marry the man you 're engaged to . " " I love Harry Collins . " I could feel the color rising in my cheeks , and my heart stirred as I said his name ; yet even as I said it I had to admit to myself that for the last few hours I had not given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened that night . Other people 's lives had come between , and I had not missed his presence until that moment . I knew , too , that he would disapprove of this strange experience . I should not be able to share it with him as I was sharing it now with Merck Vance . So I protestedmore firmly because I felt I had been disloyal to Harry . " I love Harry Collins , " I repeated , " and the only happiness I want is the kind of life we 'll have together , whether you approve of it or not . " " All right , " he nodded . " If that 's what you want , I hope you 'll get it ; but I still think  --  what I think . . . . Ip185did n't expect to like you , but I 've changed my mind . You 've got qualities I hate to see going to waste . " " Such as ? " I faced him challengingly . Again he shrugged and smiled . " The trouble with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're trying to make yourself believe you 're a vine . Usually it 's the other way round : the weak think they 're the strong ones . Maybe that 's why they get their way so often . Well , I say a person ca n't be a rock and a barnacle at the same time . And who wants to be a barnacle ? " Before I could answer , the two men who had been sittingat the other end of the diner passed close to our table ; and to my surprise I recognized Jo Kelly . I do not think he noticed us . If he did he gave no sign as he went out . I must have shown my surprise , for Merek Vance answered my look . " You never know where you 'll run into Jo Kelly nowadays , " he said . " I could n't place that man with him ; one of the union crowd , probably . " " An agitator ? " I asked . " Well , " he smiled tolerantly , " personally I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then you 're with Jo Kelly on this union business ? " " I 'm for unions , yes ; but they 're not a religion with me the way they are with him . I ca n't feel that they 're going to solve everything , because the trouble goes deeper than that . . . . At best they 're only a step in the right direction . My father was like Jo : he believed in causes too hard and in what they were going to accomplish . There have to be pcople like that  --  but you 'll hardly ever find a reformer that does n't die pretty bitter and disillusioned . I saw my father go that way , and I made up my mind then I would n't mix up with groups or organizations . I 'd try and see things as straight as I could for myself , and stick to them in my own way and work on my own .... I guess I 'm what you 'd call a rank individualist . " " And yet a doctor has to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid out by a group , " I pointed out . " The rules of life and death are what everyone has to conform to , " he reminded me . " We just try to outwit death , the way I had to tonight . I admit , though , it 's not as simple as I make it sound . " I did not press the discussion further . Something I had learned in a literature class years before came knocking at my mind . I remembered it word for word : " Eagles commonlyfly alone ; they are crows and starlings that flock together . " I found myself studying him across the table as if I had never really seen his dark , sharp-featured face and his keen , restless eyes before . " I  --  I beg your pardon . " I realized that he had been speaking to me and I must ask him to repeat the words . So easy had it been for me to talk with him for the past half-hour that I had forgotten my deafness . " I was speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man at the counter started the canned music just now , and I wondered if you had any sensation yet . " I shook my head . " Only a kind of vibration that I can feel from the floor boards under my feet and at the back of my chair ; nothinghere "  --  I touched my ears . " You 're wasting your time with me , you know . . . . Are n't you tired of your part of the bargain ? " It was his turn to shake his head.  | " I 've got faith enough for the two of us , and besides we 've only just started . " He lit another cigarette before he went on . " I 'm going to cure you ; only I ca n't guaranteeyou 're always going to hear the things you want to hear , you know . " " I want to hear everything , " I told him . " I can take the bitter with the sweet . " " I can think of a lot of things a woman would just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  things like a child crying for what she ca n't give it , or a man 's discouraged step on the stairs and his key fumbling for the lock when he 's had too much to drink , and words that turn love into somethingpretty cheap and rotten . . . . I do n't suppose you ever stopped to think it could be like that for you ? " " Why should I think of such things ? ' ' " Sorry , I should n't have reminded you . " He took up the bill and felt for change in his pocket . " But somehow tonight I 've found myself talking to you as if you were n't one of the Blairstown Blairs . " His smile took the edge off those words . I followed him out into the chillness and once more the little car was taking us back through the unfamiliarity of early morning . The pale globes of street lamps were set at long intervals , and our house showed at last a faint , unlit shape as we turned into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up when we left the house , thankful that my key was in it . I should not need to rouse the household . We did not speak as we left the car in the old stable . Perhaps it was because I was more keyed up than I realized , or because my sense of smell had grown sharper since I had had to depend more upon it , that I felt certain we two were not alone there . There was no light anywhere in the dimness , yet the impression would not leave me as I waited for Vance to collect his bag . A faint whiff of cigarette smoke suddenly made me know that I had not been mistaken . Neither Vance nor I was smoking , and besides this scent came from above , in the rooms I had visited . As I turned to go out I passed close to the wooden stairs , and something made me reach up and feel for the key . But my fingers found only the empty nail where I had so lately hung it.  |p189IT  WAS . MIDMORNING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality of a dream , vivid , yet unreal . Merek Vance 's car was no longer in front of the house , and I could almost believe that it had never stalled there . Yet when I came downstairs to beg a belated cup of coffee from Maggie , I guessed that Aunt Em already knew somethingof my adventure . She looked up from a pile of mail she was sorting to eye me curiously . " I do n't wonder you slept late . From what that young doctor tells me you two certainly put through a pretty strenuous time of it . " " Oh , " I said , trying to sound casual , " so Dr. Vance has been here and stolen my thunder . " " He came with a mechanic to get his car while we were having breakfast , so he had a cup of coffee with us . Janice had just been telling me about noticing that the car was gone when she came back from the Parkers ' , and we did n't know what to make of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was gone , " I said . " Well , she did , " Aunt Em went on . " We were just trying to figure it out when Dr. Vance stopped to explain . I must say he was pleasanter than he 's been the other times I 've seen him . He 's always seemed a morose , cold young man to me before , but he thanked me very nicely for the loan of the car and praised you and what you did to help . Whatever possessed you to go ? " Maggie brought my coffee just then , so I postponed answeringfor a moment . " I do n't know what made me , " I told her ; " it was just one of those impulses we ca n't account for . But I thought he might have trouble with the car , and of course we did n't know till we got to the place how serious it was . I wish you 'd seen how he operated on that child , right on the kitchen table without any equipment except what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He said you turned to and helped as cool as could be . " " I was frightened , though , more frightened than I 've ever been in my life . Of course I could n't really do much . I just held the flashlight and tried to keep it steady while he worked . He was wonderful , Aunt Em ; if that child pulls through , Dr. Vance deserves all the credit . But he did n't make anything of it . " " Why should he ? That 's all in a day 's work for a doctor ; but I 'm glad he appreciated what you did . I 'm thankfulhe did n't expose you to anything contagious . " I smiled and helped myself to more coffee . Aunt Em was trying so hard to overcome her prejudices . She was transparent as a child in some ways , and I knew Merek Vance must have said the right thing . " Your uncle 's left already , " she went on . " He and Harry and Mr. Parker took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone at the same time in case anythingp191new develops at the mills . Old Jo 's laid up again . I made him go back to bed after he 'd got the furnace going . I do n't know what we 're going to do this winter if he and the furnace give out at the same time . " Janice 's door stood open half an hour later as I passed , and there she sat on the floor surrounded by a jungle of multi-colored dresses draped over chairs , bed , and lounge  --  all she possessed with several of mine added to the collection . " What 's up ? " I asked , pausing at the door . She started and stared at me keenly before she answered . " I 'm going to May Lowell 's coming-out party in Waltham , " she told me . " Florence Eaton just wrote they could put me up , and I thought I might as well go as stick the week end out here . " " Well , why not ? " I felt indifferent to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on borrowing . " But I 'm not lending you the green chiffon or the Burgundytaffeta . They 're going right back in my closet where they came from . " I removed them firmly from the rest . " And you 'd better not count on seeing Harry . He 's going to be up to his ears in work . " " Who said anything about Harry ? " She rose and began to fumble in a bureau drawer . " I was n't going to sneak off with your dresses , " she went on when she turned back to me again . " They can rot on their hangers for all of me . I was just trying to see if I could fix over my old blue net some way so I wo n't be ashamed to appear in public . You need n't always jump to conclusions , Emily ; and people that go chasing all over the country with strange doctors at all hours of the night and morning need n't hand out advice ! "  | Her eyes narrowed and I saw that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she bent to fold the blue net and lay it in the open suitcase . Then she flung back her soft curls and faced me again . " Oh , yes , " she went on , " we heard all about your errand of mercy at the breakfast table . It sounded almost too good to be true  --  like an unpublished chapter of Florence Nightingaleor something . " " Do n't forget , " I reminded her , " that the car belongs to me as much as it does to you even if I do n't use it very often . And by the way , I do n't see how you happened to notice it was gone when you came back . You could n't have seen way down to the old stable from the house . " A look of defiance sprang up in her eyes . They darkenedas they always used to when she was a child facing some moment of reckoning . She mumbled something that I could n't follow . " What 's that you say ? " I persisted . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn your head away . " " Well , then "  --  she wheeled about and formed her words with exaggerated care  --  " I went down there to see if the keys were in the car . I was afraid I might have left them in . When I saw it was gone I did n't know what to think . I almost called the police . " " It 's certainly something new for you to start worrying about the car keys . You know you always leave them in . " She shrugged her slim shoulders under the yellow sweater that so exactly matched the color of her hair . But her eyes and mouth were sullen as she turned back to her sorting and packing . I could see that the subject was closed as far as she was concerned . I collected my windbreaker and beret and started down/stairs again . In the hall I met Maggie cleaning the carpets . Maggie was having what was alluded to in the household as " one of her off days . " I could tell from the set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on the handle of the vacuum cleaner that her mind was even busier than her body . " Well , Maggie , " I said as she stopped to let me by , " I suppose you heard about last night . " " Yes , " she nodded , " I heard , and I say good for the both of you . " I was surprised that she did n't scold me . I had expected at least one vigorous reprimand . " And when you see him , " she went on , " you 'd best tell him to come by and take a look at Old Jo . He 's a bundle of knots this morning that 'll take more than those sticky mustard plasters of his to untie . " " Why not telephone Dr. Weeks ? " I suggested . " It 's not Dr. Weeks I mean . " She stood with her arms about the vacuum cleaner , making something impressive and antique of its black polished handle . " No , " she repeated , eyeing me shrewdly as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after . No reflection on old brooms , but a new one sweeps clean . " " All right , Maggie , I can leave word at his office when I 'm out walking Bridget . But why did n't you speak to him yourself when he stopped this morning ? " Again she gave me a keen look . " I thought it would come better from you , " she said , " and I reckoned you 'd be seeing him same as usual . " " But , Maggie , " I began , " what makes you think  --  " Once more she looked at me . It was the way she usedto look when we were children and all our most carefully guarded secrets turned out to be old stories to her . While I hesitated she laid her forefinger to her lips and smiled reassuringly . " I do n't have to think , Miss Emily , " she said ; " I just know . You ca n't live with people like I 've lived with all of you Blairs and not have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what 's in the air . No . " She shook her head as I opened my lips to protest . " Do n't say a word , then I wo n't have to . " I stood there without a word , watching her as she stooped and began coiling the long cord of the vacuum and fitting it into place . There was something so final and oracular about Maggie 's statements that one had no need of answers or arguments . She was , as she had told me before , like a familiar piece of furniture . We flung ourselves upon her as we might on the chairs or sofa , counting on her being where we expected to find her . We took her presence for granted , and that was her hold over us . I did not know how she knew what I thought I had kept from everyone . I should never know , and I was torn between scolding her and flinging myself into her arms . So I did neither , and she appeared to expect nothing more from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we had not spoken , " do you think we should get in touch with young Jo before we call in 1 ) r . Vance ? " " That 's up to you , Miss Emily . But Old Jo wo n't see him , the way things are . If he could slip in and tinker with the furnace I must say it would be a help . Nobody knows how to work it like those two do . It 's kind of ticklish to get him in without his grandpa or Miss Blair knowing , but I could sneak him down cellar if he came the back way.  |p195The  boy 's good-hearted if he is always mixed up with the wrong sides of things . " " I 'll tell him if I can track him down . You do n't think , do you , Maggie , that he ever comes up here to the old stable ? " " Not that I know of , Miss Emily . What makes you ask that ? " " Oh , I just wondered . " I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . He would be busy at the clinic till noon and then off on visits for another hour at least . But I would walk awhile first and perhaps find young Jo Kelly over by the union headquarters , which had been temporarily set up in a vacant building not far from the railroad station . It was one of those raw December days when the sun has a metallic quality to its shining and even a distant red barn looks dull in the unlit distance . One feels the weight of coming snow as if it were a burden on the heart . Now and then a hard , icy flake touched my cheek or lay on my coat sleeve . The softly feathered kind would come later , and the bleakness of bare trees , stark buildings , and brown yards would be smothered in white by night . But these forerunners seemed to me like the difficult scanty tears of old , old people . The excitement and accomplishment of the night before were gone . I no longer felt the energy that had warmed me then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to lift my spirits . As I neared the railroad station I saw groups of children along the tracks and about the yards collecting bits of coal to carry home in dirty flour bags or boxes or toy express wagons . It was the noon period between morning and afternoon school sessions , when they should have been home eating dinner or out in the playgrounds . But there they were , as busy as the brown sparrows in the Square . The station agent stood on the platform as I passed and , when he saw me watching them , he gave me an apologetic sidewise look . " Morning , Miss Blair . " He came over as I paused . " Feels like we 'll get snow tonight . Have to keep an eye on these kids from the mill or they 'll try and root up the ties to cart home . Still , it 's one way to get the place picked clean as a wishbone , and what can I do about it ? " He shrugged and shifted his tobacco . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severely at the Indian Chief on the Peace-Pipe sign as if he might volunteeradvice . At that moment Bridget stiffened beside me , and I turned just in time to see a small , shabby boy take aim with a sling shot . The station agent ducked , and I caught the dog 's collarand held her firmly . Something flew past us , and a dent appeared in the painted profile of the sign . I saw that other dents had pitted the signboard , and several letters of the legend " Peace-pipe for Quality " were mutilated . At any other time I would have smiled over that exhibition of marksmanship , but that day I felt chilled and hurt , as if the stone or bit of coal had struck me , too . " Fresh , that 's what ! " The station agent returned to me after making threatening gestures towards the little group as it scattered . " Ca n't trust one of them behind your back . That sign sure is a tempting target for the little rascals though . Well , kids will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leash on Bridget and continued my way.  |p197Several  figures were lounging about the door of the dingy brick building where the union had set up its headquarters . They eyed me curiously as I came up to the entrance , and it seemed to me that they drew closer together as if they instinctively distrusted my coming . A woman in the little group nudged the man beside her , and I was certain that I made out the shape of my name on several lips . I had come too far to turn back , however , much as I wanted to hurry in the opposite direction . By the steps I stopped short and singled out the most familiar face , one of the workers I had often seen loading trucks in the mill grounds . " Good morning , " I began . " I 'm looking for Jo Kelly , and I thought I might find him here . " The man touched his can and nodded a bit nervously , I thought . " Guess Jo 's inside , " he said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together presently . " What 's the matter ? " Jo asked without ceremony . " Is it Grandpa ? " I nodded as he fell into step beside me . We walked away together , and it seemed to me that I could feel the curious eyes fixed on my back . I realized that it had been rash of me to go there , that Jo would be held to account later . " I 've got to talk to you , " I said . " If you can spare a few moments let 's go in the station . " He followed me into the empty waiting room , and Bridget jumped on the wooden bench between us , her head flattened against Jo 's trouser leg where his knee bones pushed sharply through the worn material . " I do n't mean to worry you about it , " I said , " but he 's pretty badly crippled , and we think Dr. Vance ought to sec him . I thought I 'd tell you first , and then you can have a talk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why , sure , " he agreed , and went on stroking the dog mechanically . " I think you could n't do better . I do n't suppose he 's  --  changed about me any ? No . Well , I guess I ca n't expect it , but I sure wish there was something I could do . " " Old Jo 's in no shape to work with the furnace , " I told him , " but he will get up and try . Maggie says it 's acting up again , and no one but you knows how to handle it . She said she 'd sneak you down cellar if you 'd take a look at it . I hate to ask favors of you , Jo , but if you could  --  " He smiled , and his teeth showed white and sharp as Bridget 's . " Why , do n't mention it , " he grinned . " I 'll be over later  --  maybe I 'd better make it after dark in case Grandpa had an eye out the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe . Sure I can count on Maggie ? " " It was her idea to ask you , " I said . " Maybe I should n't have come down here looking for you . I did n't think it might be hard for you to explain to  --  to your friends . " " Do n't worry about that , Emily . " " I promise not to do it again , only you 'd better let me know some way I can reach you if I have to . " He went over to the other side of the waiting room , scribbled something on a telegraph blank and brought it back to me . " You send word down there , " he explained , " and they 'll know where I am . Do n't forget now , if you need me . " " I wo n't forget . " I spoke then of Angeletta . " Must be a couple of years since I saw her , " he coin/mented . " I 'd like to help her some way if I could . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always thought I was sweet on Angie . " " I used to think you were in high school . " He shook his dark head emphatically . " I had plenty of foolish notions then , " he admitted , " but that was n't one of them . Well , you tell Maggie to keep an eye out so 's she can sneak me in . Look here , this dog 's coat seems kind of poor to me . Try a spoonful of malt every day , and a lump of sulphur in her drinking water wo n't hurt any either . So long . " The expected snow had begun to fall in thin flakes by the time I reached the Doctor 's steps . I felt glad of the shabby warmth of the office while I waited for his return . The small blue box stood on top of a pile of papers and medical reports on his desk . I reached for it and touched the painted flowers and hearts and inscription with my finger tips . Our house was crowded with old things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this ( lid whenever I took it in my hands . Merek Vance came in presently , shaking snow from his collar and hair , looking more boyish than I had seen him in many visits . He stood warming his hands at the radiator and eyeing me intently . " You look tired , " he said . " Was last night too much for you ? " I shook my head . " No , not last night  --  it 's this town . I ca n't help feeling when I walk around that it 's been struck by some blight . " " It 's not the only place that has been , " he answered . " From what I hear of the big cities , they 're worse off . "   " How 's the Gallo boy ? " I asked , glad to change the subject . " He 's coming along splendidly . We made a good clean job of it last night . The visiting nurse is going over there to change the dressing and check up on his temperature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " You 're not used to such strenuous evenings . No wonder you 're tired today . " " Oh , " I sighed , " being tired is n't what I mind . It 's things you ca n't do anything about that get you down . It seems worth while to do what you did last night . At the time I could n't feel anything mattered except your pulling that child through so he 'd go on living and breathing . But afterwards  --  do n't you ever say to yourself What for ? ' " " Well , suppose I do ? " he asked in turn . " Last night it seemed wonderful to save a child 's life , " I persisted , " and then this morning I saw a lot of children grubbing and fighting over little lumps of coal along the railroad tracks . I suppose that was what started me thinking . . . . You know for most of them there 'll never be enough coal or food or clothes or anything else to go round . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peopleup , curing them of one thing to be ready for something worse . Does n't it seem pretty futile to you ? Is n't it almost like operating on a condemned man so he 'll be in good shape for hanging ? " He did not seem to mind my tirade . He went on warminghis hands and watching me across the little space that divided us . " Yes , there are times when a doctor feels like that , " he said at last . " Maybe it 's because you 've just come round to taking notice , that it 's knocked you all of a heap . I supposep 201I got used to the inconsistencies you mentioned and to the waste of human beings earlier than most do . I 'm not reconciled to it , as you say , and I never will be . I look at it differently , that 's all . " " How ? " I leaned forward in my chair , and my hands still pressed the small blue box . " You 're thinking in the plural , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learns to think in terms of the singular  --  one person at a time and do what you can for him . We have to forget mass tragedy in relieving one human being . Lucky thing it 's that way , or we would n't be able to take it most of the time . " He was busy after that with preparations that were now a familiar routine to us both . I submitted to my part absently , hardly aware until I felt that brief prick of the needle that another treatment was over . But before I had collected my things to go he stopped me . " Do you mind if I ask a favor , " he said , and I thought he seemed hesitant , embarrassed as I had never known him to be before . " It 's my birthday , and it 's bad luck , I 've always heard , to drink one 's own health . I was n't going to notice the day , but I seemed to feel the need of telling someone ; and I hope you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he disappeared and returned with a bottle and two glasses . " This is very old port , " he explained ; " but we must n't take any chances with the law , so as your doctor I shall prescribe for you first . " He laughed and scribbled quickly on his office pad . I took the page he tore off and read what he had written there . My name came first , then some unintelligible medicalshorthand and below that the familiar words : " To be taken as directed . M. Vance . December 11th , 1931 . " I have that bit of paper yet , though I have no need to refreshmy memory . " Now that you 've prescribed , " I smiled back at him as he poured the wine carefully so that not a drop should spill , " I suppose I 'd better be deciding on a toast . If you were Dr. Weeks I 'd say , Your health , ' and if you were Janice I 'd say , Happy days . ' But I 'm a little puzzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and happiness as well as anyone , and I 'm just entering my thirty-third year , if that 's any clue . " He held out the little glass as he spoke . I took it , but still I hesitated . " Here 's to your not being sorry you came back to Blairstown , " I said at last , and took the first sip . " And here 's the same to you , Emily Blair . " We drank our port without further toasts , and I thought how strange it was that I , of all people , should have been the one to wish hind well on his thirty-second birthday . I went back through the years to another December afternoon . I had been seven then , so he must have been fourteen at that Christmas party when I had first felt myself the target of bitterness even as the Indian Chief 's head had been earlier that day . " You 've gone a long way since then . " I must have spoken my thoughts , for he looked at me questioningly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mill Christmasparty , " I explained . " You remember the one I mean ? " He nodded , and I went on . " I do n't seem to have got very far , at least not the way you have . Last night you said I was in a comfortable little rut , and you 're probably right . "  | " Did I ? Well , there are a lot of worse places to be than ruts . And I do n't know how far I 've gone when it comes to that . A good many people might think I 'd doubled back on my tracks and landed where I started from . " I squinted at the wine in my glass before I answered . " I think coming back to a place takes a special sort of perspective , " I told him , " unless , of course , one comes back to gloat . " He followed me to the door and promised to visit Old Jo Kelly as soon as office hours were over . As I turned to go he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're right , " he said , " about my coming back to Blairstown . I thought it was all my wanting to help Dr. Weeks out ; but perhaps I did want to do a little gloating , though I would n't admit it to myself before . " P204UNCLE WALLACE AND HARRY returned from Boston lookinggraver than when they had left , and Mr. Parker stayed on for more conferences with Directors and bank executives . " It 's the same story everywhere , " Uncle Wallace told us , " only worse in New Bedford and Fall River . Even down South they 're feeling the pinch . Business is n't dull , it 's just plain dead . " I tried to catch all I could , and for once Harry seemed ready to explain the situation in terms that I could grasp . " The banks are n't going to refuse , are they ? " I asked him . " They wo n't withdraw their backing or loans , or whatever you call it ? " " Banks are tightening up everywhere , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday dinner , while Uncle Wallace and Aunt Em talked and went over reports in the study . " The bankers that Peace-Pipe has always dealt with did n't exactly turn us down , but they 're not taking any chances with their money . " " How do you mean , dear ? Make it easy for me to understand if you can ? " P205He was unusually patient with me that afternoon , and I tried to ask as few questions as possible . My head ached with the strain of reading his lips , with piecing together facts when I lost words here and there and tried to follow without asking for repetitions . The situation was simple enough when I got to the bottom of it . The banks would continue their backing and even make additional loans if they could have assurance that our mill would reopen by the first of the year . " It 's a fair enough proposition , " Harry admitted ; " the only trouble is we 're pressed for time . The union 's got us in a tight spot  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come round to their terms . That 's what they 're counting on . " " Ca n't you put it up to the workers themselves ? This way it 's as if both sides were starving each other out . There 'll be nothing left of the business if it goes on like this . " " You 're right , there wo n't be . That 's why we 've got to reopen , strike or no strike . If we recognize their union , that means accepting a new wage scale . We 'd be filling orders at a loss if we met their demands . They 're beginning to feel the pinch down there now  --  " " I know , Harry , I know . Even over here I can feel how much worse things are this week than last , and with Christmas coming and all  --  something 's got to be done . But what ? " I searched his face , but found no optimism there . " The banks agree with us there 's only one stand to take . Mill hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay ; those who do n't  --  Well , " he shrugged expressively , " they 'll just have to stay outside the gates and let the union worry about them . We can get all the help we need ; too many out of work in this town , and plenty of others if it comes to that . " " You mean you 'll call in strikebreakers  --  scabs ? " I had never used the word before except to young Jo Kelly . I saw Harry 's surprise at my mention of the term . " Why , yes , " he admitted , " that 's about what it amounts to . I 'm not saying there wo n't be trouble , but we 've tried every other way since the walk-out . " " Trouble ? " I asked . " Even more than now ? " " They may put up a fight . Still a picket line would n't make much show if we called in the State militia  --  " He broke off , seeing the horrified look on my face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course we hope it wo n't come to that . We want to keep things peaceful if we can . " I could not speak for a minute . I sat there on the sofa beside him and tried to remember all that I had ever read about strike violence and militia being called out in other plants . There was a newsreel I had seen once where officerswith raised clubs bore down on men and women who retreated before them like a dark wave , and there were blurred newspaper prints of crowds being scattered by tear-gas bombs . I wondered if Harry could be thinking beyond the words he said . " And if Peace-Pipe did n't reopen  --  for a while , I mean ? " I could see that he was growing tired of my questions before he answered . " It 's got to , " he told me . " It 's got to reopen or go under . Do you know how much we 're losing every day the plant 's idle ? No ? Well , I can get you the figures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of itself , you know . " " But it 's awful to talk about it like that , " I protested , and I could feel tears gathering in my eyes . " I ca n't seem to put money first , not ahead of the people over there . Maybe I feel differently about it because I went to school with some of them . I ca n't just call them mill hands and let it go at that . They 've got their side , too , and when I see the children  --  " " There you go sentimentalizing . " His mouth hardened as he spoke , and he turned on me accusingly . " You asked for facts , and I 'm giving them to you . You 've got to stop mixing up in what you do n't know the first thing about , and you 've got to stop middle-of-the-night errands of mercy with strange doctors . " I was so startled I had no answer ready . How could he have heard about my visit to the Gallo family so soon after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it myself . " Oh , " I began lamely , " you 've heard about that  --  " " Yes , I heard . Things like that get around . " I felt myself growing hot , hurt by his criticism and worriedbecause I did not wish to have him question me further about Merck Vance . " If you ran into Janice in Boston , " I said , " and she told you  --  well , you know how she exaggerates ... " I scarcely thought what I was saying until he rose and went to the window as if he did not want to meet my eyes . So Janice had told him . I could imagine that she had made the most of the incident . " It was n't anything I planned to do , Harry . " I rose and went over to where he stood , toying with the shade cord in his preoccupied way . " And Dr. Vance did n't ask me to . I just went along when he borrowed the car . . . . I ca n't sec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped my hand through his arm and tried to make him look at me . But he was unresponsive to my touch . " Please , Harry , " I begged foolishly because I felt so completely cut off from contact . He could put me miles away simply by keeping his face averted . " I never thought you 'd mind my going . You do n't really , do you ? " He turned around at last , and though he smiled I felt no reassurance behind it . " It 's not whether I mind or not , Emmy , " he said , . formingthe words emphatically so that I could not possibly mistake them . " But you must remember you ca n't afford to get talked about . You 're not just anybody in this town . Your family 's been behind Peace-Pipe for generations . You 're part of it and everything it stands for , do n't forget that . " " I do n't forget , " I began , " but it seems to me there 's a lot that none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business fifty years ago , even ten years ago , may be all wrong now . " I saw his eyes grow cold behind the little flecks of golden light that I loved even more than his tilted brows and humorous mouth , and I hurried on before he could turn away . " I do n't pretend to know anything , but I 'm honestly trying to see both sides . A business can grow too big for a family to run , like  --  like a snowball you roll till it gets bigger than you are . " It surprised me to find myselfrepeating the very words young Jo had said . " That old Indian in his war feathers has seen a lot of changes since he came to be our trademark . " " And a lot of good will and respect are behind him , andp209money , too , " he reminded me . " I may have criticized the kind of goods we 've been turning out , and I still think we 're behind the times in lots of ways ; but Peace-Pipe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty proud of the product of the mill if I were you . " I realized that it was useless to go on with a discussion that was only drawing us further apart . It hurt and puzzled me that he should resent my interest , that he should make such an issue of my visit to the sick child of a worker 's family . He made me feel almost as disloyal as if I had joined the picket line across the river . I was relieved when he proposed going out for a drive . Because it was Sunday afternoon the town seemed momentarilyto have shed its blight . There were no shabby lines of men and women about the mill gates , and the motionlessmachinery and smokeless chimneys were less oppressivethan in the weekday idleness . The snow which usually took on a gray film of smoke as it fell had stayed white . The town looked its best with sharp roof lines and bare trees and lawns softened into prim beauty . We kept to the main road which had been cleared and drove north towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I breathed more freely . The little car took the miles , almost as if it had invisible wings . No one ever drove a car better than Harry . He and the engine always seemed to merge like perfectly matched partners in some rhythm of their own . Since my deafness I had become more than ever conscious of such mechanical harmony . I felt the tension case between us , and I relaxed beside him and gave myself to the moment . If he had reached out and taken my hand just then , I think I might have been completely happy . Even without that I forgot to be troubled and afraid.  | Christmas was only ten days off , and the feel of it was in the air . Red barns were warmed to brightness on the side where the low sun struck . Apple trees in orchards were stubbornly crooked to the clear pale sky and clumps of hemlock invading rough pastures were purple-dark against the snow . Now and then a wreath showed at some windowor door , and Christmas greens and bunches of scarlet berries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just before we turned to drive back I signaled Harry to stop at one of these stands . " I must have a bunch , " I told him ; " I know Aunt Em has ordered our wreaths months ago , but these are somehowspecial . " He drew up obligingly while I got out to make my selection . My reason told me that the berries could not possibly be as brilliant as they seemed . It was the slantwise , winter light in that hour before sunset that laid a curious shine upon them . It was as if each and every round red ball had been dipped in glory . If only one could keep them so always , I thought , along with moments that are kindled by a look or a word or a smile from someone we love ! I bought a miniature Christmas wreath , no bigger than my two fists . It would be too small to make a showing among the laurel festoons and wreaths of holly and ground pine that always filled our house . But I decided it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harry smiled tolerantly as I carried my purchases back to the car , and we drove home through the December sunsetwith the chimneys of Peace-Pipe black shapes against clouds of feathered flame . There was a light at Dr. Weeks ' house as we passed , a single oblong of brightness in the wing where Merekp211Vance had his office . I could picture him at his desk . It seemed right and natural to think of him there . I was startled to remember how short a time it was since he had come to Blairstown . But then it was not as if he were a stranger . Peace-Pipe was in his past , too , even as it was in mine . The shadow of those black chimneys , the bitter smoke from their throats , and the pulse of humming mill machinery had somehow marked us both long ago . We were both a part of the " product of the mill . " I Tarry had flung that phrase at me a little while before , and I had thought little of those five familiar words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as the scarlet berries had taken on strange brightness by the roadside . Peace-Pipe had made me the sort of person I was . By the same token Merek Vance was what he was because of those difficult years of resentment his childhood had known across the river and its bridges . " Peace-Pipe for Quality , " another well known phrase , leaped to my mind . I hoped it applied to me . But I was n't sure of myself as I was of him . I found myself smiling to think how vehemently the dark sharp-featured man behindthat lighted window would deny the charge.  |p212MIRACLES  ARE OUT of fashion nowadays . Or perhaps it is only that they have been explained away from us . Radios and newsreels and words have shorn them of their mystery . Yet to each of us , I think , a miracle is given at some time in our lives . We may not choose the moment it shall be revealed or the form it shall take . We may not even realize till long afterward that it was our privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wonder that our hearts accept . I fought against the miracle that was to be mine , but there was no denying it when it came to me . I must tell of it in my own way , though my words will make a poor showing to those who ask for explanations in technical phraseology . In the medical world much has been written about the Vance treatment of deafness and restoration of impaired nerve cells . His formula and method of injection has been widely publicized in the last year , hailed as one of the greatest contributions to medical scienceand a boon to humanity . Already it is being put to practical test by doctors in hospitals and clinics all over the country , and reports of even greater uses to which itp213may be applied are continually appearing . But of these I may not write even if it were in my power to master the terms . These seem to have no part in the visits I made to the bare , poorly equipped office during those months which were to change the whole course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in print , " Merek Vance , M.D. "  --  and I come upon them often nowadaysin magazines and newspapers ' I must stop and convincemyself that they belong to the man whose faith and determination dominated that shabby room and all who entered it . But the printed name has less reality for me than the remembrance of an alert face that could darken to disapproval or light up in sudden sympathy . The medicaljournals with their impressive accounts of his discovery seem vague and impersonal compared to the makeshift rack of test tubes with their homemade labels , the long , skillful fingers that handled them , and the prick of a needle whose power I once dared to doubt . It frightens me a little to read of that doctor and his achievement . But when I remember his eyes watching me across the battered desk I am reassured . I have faltered under the directness of his look and the uncompromising words he has spoken , but they have had power over me in the past , and they will have power to hurt and strengthen me again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restored to him had no explanation to offer in testimonial . He could only stand and stare and repeat , " I was blind , now I see . " That is how it was with me . Whatever I am or may become , I shall never be as I was before . For I am no longer shut off from the sweet and the harsh sounds of earth . The . simple , terrible impact of spoken words is mine once more , and I shall never take the gift for granted . Even though I should live to be an old , old woman I doubt that I can ever be unshaken by the first splashing of rain , by the tender clamor of bird calls in early morning , and the pulse of unseencrickets hailing frost . I shall fall silent sometimes in the midst of eager voices , knowing that the wonder of voice answering to human voice is too much for me to bear . I must listen then , not to what the voices are saying , but to the silence that once made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall see a look in other eyes , a listeninglook that I shall recognize ; before which I shall be humble and kind . I have not thanked Merek Vance for what he has done for me . We do not thank the sun for rising or the air for letting us breathe it . Besides , if I tried to thank him he would only shrug his shoulders and lift his dark brows in the way I know so well . But this much he did say once , and I have not forgotten it : " No matter how many people the injections might have helped , " he told me , " I could never have taken any satisfactionif I 'd failed with you . It would have been bitter  --  like isolating the germ that had killed your wife or your child . " But I am far ahead of myself . What happens to people is the story . What they think about while it is happening to them is something else . The day after my drive with Harry I woke feeling restless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not shake off . I felt as I used to feel in my childhood when the door of a closet closed upon me and I found myself half smothered of heavy garments . Only when I pushed wa 1 them and fumbled for the doorknobwould the unreasoning panic leave me . Since therep215was no such simple way out of my depression , I decided to go to Boston on the pretext of Christmas shopping . I must get away from the fear and futility that hung over Blairstown even if I could not get away from myself . I did n't care whether I inconvenienced Vance by missing treatments . I had never had any real faith in them . Those visits to the little office , I told myself , had merely been something to do each day , nothing more . I would put an end to them with the new year . Merck Vance could n't hold me to a promise he had forced upon me . So I scribbled a hurried note and left if with the little wreath on my way to the train . Vance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clinic , and by that time I would be gone . Harry would be working late over mill reports that night . He had told me not to expect him for supper . Aunt Em seemed glad to have me go . " Do you good to get away , dear , " she said . " A clay 's shopping always used to set me up when I was your age . Just enjoy yourself and forget all about mill trouble . But do n't let Eunice know how worried we are about PeacePipe , whatever you do . You just tell her that everything 's going to be all right after New Year 's when the mill re-opens . " I promised and tried to put Blairstown behind me once I had boarded the train . But that was easier said than done . It was an express from the north , crowded with Christmas shoppers and students going home for the holidays . The stir of festivity that surged through the car had no power to lift my spirits . Bundles fell from overhead racks ; skates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aisles , fellow passengers smiled and nodded and were gay and good-humored about me . But I could not shed my ownP218me . Suddenly I found my arms full of packages and my head throbbing with the effort I had made to secure them . I walked past my reflection in a looking-glass panel and smiled to see that I looked like all the other bundle-laden shoppers . To see me no one would have guessed how littlefestivity I felt . It was only midafternoon ; but already twilight was settling over the city , and the brightness of decorated windows accentuated the early December dark . I made my way to the edge of the sidewalk and went on , letting the home-going crowd take me in the direction of Copley Square . I had no reason for returning to Cousin Eunice 's house before dinnertime , and I thought a walk might help me to face the barrage of her questions . So I moved on without objective . The city sights and smells brought back associations with every block . All the futile visits to doctors ' offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the florist 's at the corner where bunched violets kept their fragrance longer ; the blind man with his magazine and newspaper stand ; the pet shop window with its never failing crop of round , luster-eyed puppies . I did not pause to tap at that pane of plate glass as others were doing . Back in Blairstown , Bridget would be missing me , I knew , whether anyone else did or not . It seemed to me that beggars and street venders were more in evidence than usual . I tried not to notice them , shivering at the curb among their tawdry wares . The contrastfrom corner to corner took me by surprise : on one , stacks of spruce and fir trees and greens making the air pungent with spice ; and across the way , black headlines that newsboys held high  --  " Financier Commits Suicide , BankruptcyHinted , " " Market Hits New Low for Year , " p 219 " Third Largest Mass . Woolen Mill Closes . " If Harry had been there walking beside me I should not have read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their import would not have made me shiver under the warmth of my sealskin coat . Ugh ! Let me get away from headlines and people sellingthings I do n't want to buy ! I thought as I stepped off the curb and started across the street . Usually I was timid in traffic , overcautious because of my deafness . I thought I was careful then ; but I must have been more preoccupied than I realized , for suddenly I stopped short trembling from head to foot . Once more I was conscious of sound . This time there could be no doubt . A horn honked shrilly and brakes screeched at the same instant a truck shuddered to a stop so close beside me I could feel the throbbing heat of the motor . I stood there smiling foolishly into the furious , frightened face of the driver . I can see him yet , glaring at me over the wheel , while I continued to stand and smile as if he had saved my life instead of so nearly crushing it out of existence . Just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names he was calling me . His frantic gesturings finally brought me to my senses . I do n't know how I made my way across the street . I only know that I was still smiling long after I had reached safety . My knees went weak then , and my hands shook so that I could hardly keep my bundles from scattering . I found the refuge of a bench and sank down on it . I must have made a spectacle of myself , surrounded by gayly wrapped packages , with tears streaming down my cheeks for any passer-by to see . But I did n't care who saw me there . I did n't care what anyone thought . It did n't seem incongruous that a strident motor horn had been the means of revealing the miracle that I could no longer deny . I have no idea how long I sat huddled on that cold bench in the city twilight , shaken with sobs and oblivious to the curious looks of those who passed . Maybe it feels like that to die and be lifted out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or perhaps that realization of well-being only comes when we who have given up hope suddenly feel its living stir within us , as Aaron 's rod put out leaf and bud for a sign . And so I walked back through the dusk with my bundles . Silhouettes of Christmas wreaths showed dark against all the lighted windowpanes in the houses I passed . My face was stiff with drying tears , and I scarcely knew how my feet took me along the streets . But I no longer felt alone . I turned once , half expecting to see Merek Vance at my elbow . He had dragged me back from unheard dangerbefore , and now , miles away from the congested street crossing , he had saved me once again . He would be keepingoffice hours at his desk in the familiar room . I knew that , and yet it seemed to me that I could feel his hand warm and reassuring on my arm . I stood a moment by the flight of stone steps , bracing myself against the chill iron railing before I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lifeless again . It might be days or hours before they quickened to sound once more , and I would hear it again . Yet the signal had come . P221THAT WAS A STRANGE and wakeful night in Cousin Eunice 's spare bedroom . I tried to read myself to sleep , but the words on the pages I turned had less reality than the pattern of the flowered wallpaper . I put out the light at last and lay , tense and wide-eyed in the darkness , my mind churning over and over all the happenings of the day . It had begun gray and tight-fisted as some knob of bud on a winter tree , and then it had changed miraculously like the tiny dried flowers we children used to watch expand to color and beauty in a bowl of water . Yes , it had bloomed like that for me . Although there had been no recurrence of sound since afternoon , I was certain of what I had heard . I felt certain , too , of a subtle change in my ears . Silence muffled them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if a telephone wire , long disconnected , had suddenly become charged with a live current . It startled me , too , to realize that in spite of my stubborn refusal to believe in or hope for a cure , something secret and strong in me had managed to keep faith all along . I must have clung to it unconsciously  | even while my lips uttered their denials . So I drifted off to sleep at last with morning a thin gray behind the near-by chimneys ; with happiness wrapping me more warm and light than Cousin Eunice 's best eiderdown quilt . " No , I ca n't stay , " I told her at breakfast . " I must take the next train . " " Always on the go , you young people , " she reproved across the silver coffee service . " No stability or sense about you . It 's as if you were all too busy tracking down happinessever to meet up with it . I always gave you credit for wanting to marry and settle down , but lately you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrutinized me from her puffy , well preservedface . " Well , " she went on . " I suppose I should n't blame you for wanting to get back to Harry . Heaven knows , long engagements are trying enough without all you 've had to put up with beside . I guess you two wish you had some of the money that 's been thrown away on ear specialists these last years . It would come in handy to start housekeeping . " I lifted my coffee cup and nodded over its gold rim . " This is lovely china , Cousin Eunice . " I touched the porcelain admiringly as I spoke . " Coffee tastes better out of these cups than any I know . " Praise of her possessions usually mollified her , but that day she could n't be distracted . " There 's the paper , " she said . " Maybe you have the courage to read it . Frankly I have n't ; nothing but bank failures and mill shutdowns and suicides . With all this unfortunatebusiness at Peace-Pipe and dividends going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're coming to . Do you ? "   " Harry and Uncle Wallace are too worried to talk much , " I hedged . " But the mills are going to reopen  --  that 's all I know . " " I ca n't see why they 're not making money , " she persisted . " After all , it 's not as if Peace-Pipe were manufacturingluxury goods , like silk or perfumery or fancy linens . People all over this country have to sleep and wash themselves , so there 's always a demand for sheets and pillowcases and towels . " I found myself thinking of the Gallo family huddled round the kitchen stove and of the gaunt , grimy faces I had seen at street curb and park the day before . " I guess there are plenty of people nowadays who 'd think a clean sheet or a towel was a luxury , " I reminded her . Without waiting for her answer I set down my cup , and rose from the table . In my impatience to be on my way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that day I did not mind the bleakness of the waiting room with all its earlier associations . The smell of varnished wood and cinders , of wet wool and rubber from overcoats and galoshes could not depress me even on so dark and moist a morning . I had felt elated as the taxi brought me through a gray drizzle that slanted in from the water front . The traffic had been hopelessly snarled in the maze of narrow , crowded streets . Sleet filmed the sidewalks and glazed the umbrellas that clustered like jungles of strange mushrooms by subway entrances and street crossings . Yet they did not seem grotesque to me that dark December morning . My heart bore up my body . I felt that curious whetting of the senses , that inner quickening that is the nearest thing to pure joy . I moved in a kind of glow of my own making . It seemed to me that people felt and responded to it . The taxi driver smiled as he helped me out . The porter who carried my bags and the ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was aware that those who waited on near-by benches eyed me with less impersonal stares . It had not been like that since the summer of my engagement when my happiness had brimmed over and flowed out in every direction . " You do n't see many happy-looking folks nowadays , " Maggie had said once . " It 's a treat to pass somebody that do n't look down in the mouth or out-and-out sour . " Maggie would guess the truth as soon as I crossed the threshold . Her wise gray eyes would find me out though neither of us spoke a word . Yes , Maggie and Bridget would know by some common gift of insight that they possessed , and I could trust them not to betray me . As I waited on the wooden bench with my bag and purchasesI found myself thinking of Merek Vance . It occurredto me for the first time since my flight that he might well have resented my leaving town without warning . I had only missed one day , to be sure , but my note had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastily scribbled words . If only I might rush to one of the telephone booths and call him by long distance ! Since that was still impossible I tried to think how I could make amends before I reached Blairstown . I must prepare him for the news I was bringing . So I hurried over to the telegraphstand and reached for a form . It was difficult to frame my message . Care must be taken of the wording since the local operators sometimes took far too personal an interest in the wires received and delivered . I staredp225about me in search of words , and my eyes noticed a sign that recommended the season 's greetings and listed a varietyof hackneyed suggestions . None of these suited my particular need , but I seized the idea and began to write on the yellow blank : DR . MEREK VANCECOURT HOUSE SQUAREBLAIRSTOWN , MASS. 0 COME ALL YE FAITHFUL JOYFUL AND TRIUMPHANT STOP RETURNING IMMEDIATELY . E. BLAIRThe operator counted out the words mechanically . Her pencil hung questioningly over the " 0 , " but I shook my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to " you . " Whatever changes it might suffer , I told myself , Merek Vance would be able to translate the carol into medical terms . I glanced at the clock as I crossed the waiting room . It was seven minutes before ten . I tried to calculate the time it would take for my wire to reach its destination . I could see the messenger boy crossing the Square in his rainy-day slicker and cap , ringing the Doctor 's bell , and waiting with his pencil and receipt slip in hand . Perhaps Vance would be on his way out to the car . I could see him pause in his hat and overcoat while he tore the yellow envelope open . Or if he had already left on his rounds I could picture it lying among the other papers on his desk . I thought of Harry , and my throat went dry , trying to summon words to tell him that evening when we should be alone . The station became a blur while I clung to the moment that lay ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry darling , we 've had so much bad luck , you and I. Do you think you could bear something else  --  something wonderful for a change ? " The thought of hearing his voice once more turned me faint for an instant . It might be many more weeks or months , but I could wait for that . Everything was going to be as it had been before , only better , a thousand times better . This unacknowledged chill that had lain between us since my return to Blairstown would vanish like mist under a noonday sun . Nothing in the world , it seemed , not even the trouble at Peace-Pipe , had power to dim our happiness . In the women 's waiting room I found a lone Gideon Bible chained to a table , and I began to turn the pages as I used to do on days when I felt the need of some sign from heaven . That was how I came upon the verse in the book of Proverbs . " Hope deferred maketh the heart sick : but when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " A tree of life . " . . . I could feel those very branches stirring to live green in the core of my being . I stood there shaken before the truth of those words . I tremble now as I set them down upon this sheet of paper , for they were like an echo of my own heart , of all hearts beating and hoping through time and space . I had just settled myself by the car window when a porterpassed , his arms weighed down with familiar luggage . I recognized a hatbox bearing my initials , Janice 's suitcase , and a little gray overnight bag I had given her on her last birthday . She went by before I could reach out and touch her arm . Her eyes were on the porter and a seat he had found for her far down the car . But I could see her profile under a new green hat . It was tilted like a fallen leaf on the bright waves of her hair . Her cheeks were rosy fromP 227haste and moist with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train , and haste was always becoming to Janice . No wonder people turned to watch her . No wonder that men especially forgot subjects they were discussing when she came within range . If I were a man , I told myself , I 'd certainly he attracted to Janice  --  not me . I wonder she has n't married long ago . She 's had plenty of chances to .... Maybe she knows more than she lets on about love and men and  --  oh , well , she can take care of herself , I guess . But she ought to fall in love and be happy . She 'd be different then . Maybe we could get to know each other if we did n't have to live under the same roof and always have to be on guard against being sisters . I want Janice to be happy . I 've never wanted it as much as I do today . I was tempted to rise and go to her , but already the seat beside me was filled and all my things on the overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to be alone for a little while longer . I needed to hold fast to my happiness that day , though I had enough and to spare for Janice and that whole carload of people . So I sat on in my place while the train sped away from the city , past towns and farms , whose streets and buildings I recognized through the Decemberdrizzle and my own sense of well-being . Yes , I admitted , I had been overcritical of Janice lately . The habit had grown on me since my deafness . I suppose personal bitterness and anxiety had intensified petty irritationsfrom pinpricks into deep wounds . Doubt of myself had made me resent qualities in her which under ordinarycircumstances I should never have envied . Now that I could dare to look ahead and count on all my faculties again I felt a wave of affection and tenderness overwhelm me as if Janice were once more the little sister I must humor and help even when she was most trying . Memories of our childhood stirred to the rhythm of the train . Janice had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me feel proud and protective to walk ahead when we exploredwood paths and brush them away . Once we were going to be angels and wear halos and wings in a Christmastableau ; and , the day before , I had come down with bronchitis and been put to bed . Janice was all dressed and ready when suddenly she refused to go without me . I could see her still in the trailing white robe with the homemadehalo slightly askew on her fair curls . There was the time she had sent me the bunch of violets when I won the high-school debating contest . That had been in midwinter , and it must have taken her allowance for two weeks to buy that little bunch . I felt contrite , remembering things like that . They mattered more than the antagonism that had followed . Suppose we had gone our separate ways and become strangers to each other  --  there would be time enough to change that . The next visit she made I would let her have the pick of my closet . Now that everything was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generous . Sitting there , close to the misted windowpane beyond which a wet and frosty world slid by , I gave myself up to good resolutions as I used to do in my childhood on the last day of an old year . I made mental lists to follow : I would be more tolerant of Janice ; I would be less demandingof Harry while the mill trouble took so much of his time ; I would not keep asking for tangible proof of his devotion ; I would be more thoughtful of Aunt Em , less impatient of her set ways and unasked advice ; I would try to be more sympathetic to Uncle Wallace and his blindP229acceptance of the business creeds of his youth ; I would try harder to understand Jo Kelly and his convictions even if they did n't fit in with family loyalties , and I would show my gratefulness to Merek Vance by admitting that I had been wrong to doubt his power to help me . It is easy to be generous and forgiving when we are in danger or when we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half . We were nearing Springwood , two stops before Blairstown , when I saw Janice reaching her bags down from the rack . It surprised me to see her doing that because usually she was anything but forehanded . As the train slowed down and the station platform came into view I was even more startled to see her moving towards the door . I half rose in my seat to go to her , but the aisle was full of alighting passengers . Oh , well , I thought , she 'll be back again . She 'll noticeher mistake the minute she 's off the train . It 's not like Janice , though , to be so absent-minded . I rubbed a clear place on the steam-filmed glass and stared out at the station platform where the drama of welcomesand goodbyes was in full swing . Cars and busses were parked close , their tops shiny with wet . Little groups of people were hurrying to one or another , exchanging handshakes and embraces , surrendering luggage as they climbed in . And then I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . I could tell that she was looking anxiously up and down , searching the wooden platform and the waiting cars . I pressed close to the window and pulled at my glove . I would signal to her by tapping with my ring . But just as I raised it to strike the glass something stopped me , and my hand dropped to my lap . I saw her wave , and there down at the end of the line of cars I recognized our little green roadster . The glass was filming again . I cleared it to make sure I was n't mistaken . There might be other such cars , but not one with our license plates , not one with Harry Collins at the wheel . He had climbed out and was coming down the platform with his long , easy strides . His hat was pulled over his eyes , but I caught the line of his chin and the familiar shape of his hand , tossing away a cigarette . He was beside her as the train began to move . I pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick up her bags before the station shut them out of my sight . P231I WAS AT HOME at last and in my own room . I had come directly from the station , not stopping at the Doctor 's as I had planned . It seemed to me that I had not drawn a free breath since the train had pulled away from the platform at Springwood . Mechanically I had collected my things , left the car , and hailed the Blairstown station taxicab . But all the time I moved without sense of feeling . My chest felt tight as if it had been frozen over . I wo n't believe it , I insisted again and again . That was n't Janice I saw on the train ; that was n't Harry waiting for her back there in Springwood . But I knew what I had seen . I did n't deceive myself . I went downstairs at last , leaving the unopened packagesas I had tumbled them in the hall . Maggie wanted to bring me lunch on a tray , but I told her I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked her , trying to appear casual . " Is n't she back yet ? " " Not that I know of , Miss Emily . Your aunt said tonightor maybe tomorrow . She was n't sure , and we did n't expect you back this early . "   She may have said more . I do not know what , for I turned away . Bridget pushed her body against my legs and nuzzled my fingers with her moist nose . I scratched the soft place behind her cars , hardly feeling what I did . Then I reached for my raincoat and umbrella and let her follow me outside . Through the slanting drizzle I made my way down the drive to the stable . It was foolish for me to go there , but I had to see with my own eyes that the car was gone . Old Jo Kelly was hobbling about among his tools and flowerpots under the stairs . He tried to straighten his bent back when he saw me there . I came in out of the wet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried bulbs and seed packets . His pipe was between his lips , and the tang of the tobacco he smoked lay strong on the damp air . I inhaled it with my own difficult breaths . The scent will stay with me always whenever I recall that afternoon and my own stress . He said something by way of greeting , but I made no effort to catch the words from his lips . " Jo , " I said finally mustering my own as I leaned against the workbench , " where 's the little car ? " " Mr. Harry come after it this morning early . I give him the keys myself . " " Mr. Harry ? " I made him repeat the name to be certain . " What did he want it for ? " I persisted . " He did n't say , Miss Emily , and I did n't ask him . Maybe I 'd ought to have , now you mention it . But he always makes free and easy with what he pleases round here . " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " he does that . " I started for the stairs , but as I reached for the hiddenP233key on the beam I felt old Jo 's hand on my arm . His eyes were searching mine anxiously . " Miss Emily , " he began , " you must n't mind my asking  --  but those rooms up there  --  I 've got them on my mind lately . You do n't go up often , do you ? " " I 've been there just once since you moved out , " I told him . " That was  --  let me think  --  about two weeks ago . What makes you ask ? " The lines deepened on his face . I had not realized that there were so many . But then I had not looked at him closely for a long , long time  --  not really looked as I was looking now . " Well , " he admitted at last , " I have n't said nothing to the rest about it , but I 've got a feeling  --  something 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Emily , I 'm afraid it 's Jo . If I thought he was up to mischief there , stirring up more mill trouble with those cronies of his . . . " He said more , but in trying to keep his lips steady I lost what followed . However , I had made out enough . Ironical , I thought , the two of us standing there in the made-over stable , afraid to put our fear into actual words . " I do n't believe Jo would set foot up there , " I told him . " He 's too honest to make use of a place that does n't belong to him . Do n't doubt young Jo : he would n't do that to you or us . " Old Jo relaxed a little , as if he were leaning on the comfortof my words . He knocked his cold pipe on a near-by beam and watched me take out the key . " I hope you 're right , " he said . " I 'll try to believe the best . But someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find the key except Jo ? " " Suppose I keep this . " I slipped the one I held into my pocket . " There 's another one on that nail . You take that and say nothing for the present . We 'll both feel easier , and it 's probably nothing to worry about . We may be mis-taken . " I left him and went out into the rain , feeling the hard , cold shape of the key in my pocket ; feeling a still more hard , more cold inner weight . So I plodded through the wet , across the Square , trying to shake off my dread , trying to believe that there would be a reason for what I had seen . Some simple , easy explanation to make me limp with thankfulness  --  that was all I asked , yet more than I expected . Merek Vance was in his office . I saw him hurry to the door as I crossed the porch . Before I knew it he had half pushed me into the old leather chair and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks than I had ever seen there , and his eyes searched and held mine before he spoke . " I 've been waiting for you , " he began , pointing to the telegram which lay open on his desk . " Ever since this came I 've been expecting you . " I made some foolish excuse about having had to go home first , and then I tried to collect myself to tell him about yesterday . But already it seemed remote and unreal . I might have been telling him of someone in a play that I had seen long ago from the last row of the gallery . I was glad for once that I could not hear my own voice , which must have sounded dull and lifeless . I can not remember the words I summoned , though I tried to explain exactly what had happened without missing a detail that might prove helpful . He jotted down a note occasionally , and now and then questioned me about such things as lengthP235of sensation , the volume of sound and whether my ears had felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all doctor as he listened and wrote and observed . Yet I was conscious , under his professional alertness , of pride and elation . Once I could have shared in that . It would have flowed from us to meet and flood the dingy room . " Well "  --  he looked up from the paper and smiled at me  --  " we 've done it ! Of course we 've got a long way to go yet ; this is just the beginning . There 'll have to be tests , much more thorough ones than I could give you here even if I had decent equipment . But we 've proved the nerves are responding to the treatment . You feel sensation now where there was nothing before . " " Yes , " I told him , and I wondered if my voice sounded as empty as I felt , " my ears are alive now . You 've done that where all the other doctors failed . . . . Even when I would n't help you by believing you could , you did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " you would n't have come here all these weeks if you had n't . None of those arguments you put up ever fooled me . You talked yourselfinto being brave , like a scared child who makes up ghosts because he 's afraid of real ones . I liked you better for that ... " I let my eyes leave his face for a moment before I spoke again . His eyes were too bright and searching . " How long , " I began , deliberately shifting the subject to a more practical angle , " how long do you think it will be before I can really hear ? " " I ca n't make predictions , " he answered . " Every case is different in response , and it may be months before we can get those nerves to function without artificial stimulus .   You 're younger than any of those we experimented on , and I told you in the beginning I 'd never worked with deafness that came as the result of meningitis . I 'll need more advice and a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to get down there as soon as I can leave  --  next week , maybe . In the meantime I 'll increase the injectionsas much as I dare and arrange with Dr. Weeks to give them to you while I 'm gone . But I 'm not rushing this . You 'll have to go on being patient awhile longer . It means too damned much to us both to take any chances now . " " All right , " I said . " I have n't asked you to hurry things , have I ? " " No , " he admitted , " not in words you have n't . But there 's something you 're not telling me .... That wire you sent  --  I 've sat here with it in front of me ever since it came . You were happy when you sent it . What 's come over you now ? " I shrugged and turned away . I could n't trust myself to answer him . I would escape from the office before he forced me into admissions . As I reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wheeled me about and made me face him . " Joyful and triumphant , " he said . " Yes , you certainly look it . " I tried to twist away ; but he kept his hold , and it was easier at last to look at him than to feel his eyes upon me . " I just wrote that to fool the telegraph operator , " I explainedlamely . " I needed something that sounded like the season 's greetings , and yet that you 'd understand . It 's not worth making such a fuss about . " " You were happy when you sent that wire , " he per/sisted , " and you 're anything but happy now . I think I have a right to know the reason . " " I 've told you everything you have a right to know . " " Everything ' is a pretty big word  --  a doctor learns not to use it as often as other people do . " He was leaning forward , still holding me by the shoulders , and his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his breath as he spoke . " Well , I suppose I ca n't make you tell me if you do n't want to . It might just happen that I have my own theory about what 's hurt you . " " Who said anything about being hurt  --  " I began , but he cut me short . " Maybe you 've found out what you were bound to sooner or later . That 's it , is n't it ? " I faltered under the directness of his look . I tried to keep my eyes on the floor , but again he forced me to lift them . " I 'm going now , " I said . " Please do n't keep mc . I 'm rather tired and  --  " But he went on as if he had not heard me . He spoke slowly so that I should not miss a syllable . " I 've been expecting this . The wonder to me is that you did n't find out before . It would have to be now though . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what you 're driving at . " I lied desperately , but he must have felt me trembling . " Oh , yes , you know , Emily Blair . " His hands dropped from my shoulders . " We both know . I 've known ever since that first time I came to your house , the night of your aunt 's birthday . " Anger rose in me like a swift and fiery tide . The room retreated in a haze , and only his face was clear in that moment . I struck at it with all the force I could summon . It was a shock to feel the hardness of his cheekbone taking the blow . We both started back and stood staring numbly at each other . The blood tingled in my hand and color came sharp and red on the cheek that I had struck . Somehow I was free of the place and walking across the Square with rain and tears mingling on my face . Bridget nudged at my heels in a worried way , and my hands were still shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Never since I was old enough to remember had I reached out to strike someone . And I had committed this physical violenceagainst Merek Vance to whom I should have been more grateful than to anyone in the world . I set my teeth and turned to recross the Square . The office door was open , and he had gone back to his desk . I saw that the folder containing the record of my case was open before him and he was already adding more notes to it . He looked up and smiled as I stood there in the door . But one cheek was still undeniably redder than the other . I went straight to the desk before he had a chance to move . " I 'm sorry , " I said . " I came back to tell you so . I never struck anyone before . I do n't know what possessed me . " He laid down his pen and closed the folder . " That 's all right , " he said . " I did n't think you had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a very healthy sign . That 's that , and let 's forget it . " " I ca n't forget that easily . It makes me afraid of myself . . . . But when you said what you did  --  it came over me in a rush . You know too much about me . You 've always known too much , and I hated you for it . " P239He gave the shrug that I had come to know so well . " It 's not that I know too much . It 's that you insisted on knowing so little . " I felt myself flushing under the impact of his words . All my hard , frantic love for Harry was laid bare suddenly . I saw it in that moment for the pitiful , hopeless thing it had been . I had made a crutch of that love that had once been a free and ardent urge between us . My need had betrayed me into making a fool of myself . Bitternessoverwhelmed me again , shutting out the momentaryflash of truth that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from the desk to my side . " Do n't try to think yet , " he told me . " You 've had a shock , two in twenty-four hours . You must give yourself time . No one can tell you what to do . I 'd be the last to try , and this  --  this other thing is out of my line . But I 'll see you through as much as anyone can . " " Thank you , " I said . " We seem to have forgotten what I came for . You have n't given me the injection . " He smiled , and the tension was broken by familiar routine . " I 'd like to go a little farther before we do any talking , " he said when he was through . " I must have a chance to discuss it with some of the rest at the hospital , and then we 'll put you through more tests . I know it 's asking a lot of you to wait . " " I 'll wait , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything without giving you warning . When we made that bargain we did n't mention a time limit . I was a lot more certain of myself then : I would n't be so ready to make bargains now . A great weariness overcame me , and I turned without a word of goodbye and started for the door . But before I reached it his arms were about me . I felt the hard muscles under the cloth of his coat , and I was too tired and shaken to protest . I was crying convulsively against him , my tears shutting out his face so that whatever he may have said I knew nothing of it . I knew only the comfort of his strength , and the surprise of his kiss , strong and compellingon my lips . And then I was leaning against the door frame and his face was growing clear again . He must have put his handkerchiefinto my hands , for I was wiping my eyes with it and drawing longer breaths . He no longer held me except with his eyes . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motions . " I 'm not sorry , " he was saying , " not any more than you were when you struck me . So now we 're even . " P241NoHARDY PERENNIAL has the enduring quality of hope . Cut it to the roots , stamp it underfoot , let frost and fire work their will , and still some valiant shoot will push , to grow again on such scanty fare as it can find . Only time and the cruel quicklime of fact can destroy that stubborn urgency . So it was with me in the days that followed . Even as I recrossed the wet and leafless Square I let hope soften my suspicions . I struggled against my doubts , turning over a dozen possible explanations for that meeting at Springwoodstation , discarding them and starting all over again as a lost traveler will make frantic dashes in every direction , only to double back on his own tracks and be no better off for his effort . I could not face what I feared . I must make excuses and believe those fears would all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he had said . He had had no right to kiss me in that sudden disquieting way . I could still feel the warmth and pressure of his lips on mine as I hurried home through the wet . I tried to shakeP242off the memory . Yet , there was comfort in it and a lingeringglow . I had not been as angry as I should have been , I told myself . But then , he had not been angry at the blow I had struck him . Perhaps , as he had said , that made us even . When you have reason to doubt the man you love another man 's kiss may seem a poor substitute , but it can bolster up a woman 's pride . We may want only the love that is denied ; but to know that we continue to be desirableis a prop to which we cling , and cling we must to whatever our hearts can lay hold on . A taxi was moving out of the driveway as I came in sight of the house , and I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carelessly in the hall . Her door was open as I passed by to go to my room . She stood at the bureau , brushing her hair , and under the hanging light it stood out from her face like a bright fan . In spite of all that I was feeling I had to notice that . She turned when she saw me in the mirror and waved the brush by way of greeting . " When did you get back ? " I asked , pausing in the doorway . " Just now , " she said , and turned back to the mirror again . " On the train ? " I persisted . " I thought there was n't one at this hour . " She laid down the brush with a gesture of impatience , and even though I strained to catch the motion of her lips I could not make out what she was saying . " I beg your pardon , " I said , " I did n't quite  --  " This time she wheeled about sharply and came nearer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me realize the trouble I was causing her  --  " I said thep243three-fifty-seven was an hour late . Christmas seems to have thrown them all off schedule . " " I 'm just back from Boston myself , " I told her , " I went up yesterday to shop , and I came back on the ten-fortyfivethis morning . " I kept my eyes fixed on her face , and it seemed to me that her lips tightened and the pupils of her eyes grew wider . But she gave no other sign of interest . " Too bad I did n't know , " she said , shaking the hair from her face with apparent unconcern . " We could have come back together . " " Yes , " I went on , " if we 'd known we might have had the car sent to meet us somewhere along the way  --  at Springwood station . A lot of people were being met there . " She turned abruptly and went back to the bureau . She took care that I should not see her face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knuckles stand out white and sharp . " You know "  --  my throat was dry , and I braced myself against the door frame , grateful for the hardness of the wood at my back  --  " there was someone who looked like you on the train this morning . You must have a double , Janice . " I tried to laugh , casually , but I doubt if I managed to sound convincing . She shrugged and went on brushing her hair . I did not wait for an answer , though I was certainmy words had made her uneasy . Once I had closed the door of my own room I felt suddenlylimp and shaken . But I was determined to keep my doubts in check until I had given Harry a chance to explain . I was n't naturally suspicious . I hated people who were always imagining that others were scheming and plotting behind their backs . I remembered reading somewherethat deafness did that to its victims . Perhaps this had crept upon me without my knowing ; perhaps I was no exception to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the power to magnify happiness . I stood there in my wet coat and hat and pressed my hands together , palm to palm , the way I used to when I said my prayers . I found myself praying again , not so much out of belief as out of my need. " 0 God , " I prayed , " do n't let this happen . Please let me be wrong in what I think . Please make it right somehow , and do n't let me lose Harry . " I remember just how I stood there , making that frantic petition over and over in the dim familiarity of my room . Looking back to it now , I neither smile nor sigh . It seems as futile to me as an earlier prayer I made asking God to change the course of the Mississippi River because I had been wrong in answering a geography question back in third grade . There are things beyond the power of prayer to change . I know that now . I have learned that we can pray for ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He goes by , we can not ask that things or people be changed to suit our needs . We may ask only to have strength to do our best , no matter how often we fall short of that . I switched on the light at last and began to take off my wet things . As I did so I caught sight of myself in the mirror and was startled at my own reflection . Rain and tears and all the varying emotions of the last twenty-four hours had changed me . I saw myself in that moment as I might look in ten , in fifteen years , as Aunt Em had ap/peared to me in my childhood . The resemblance between its was more marked than ever , and I faltered before it . Did Harry Collins see me like that and falter , too , before a future he had given his word to share ? I wo n't look middle-aged yet , I vowed as I stared into the glass . I 'm young still ; whether I feel young or not , I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet and took out the blue crepe dress that deepened the color of my eyes . I brushed my hair fiercely till it took on luster again . I parted it smoothly and let it wave back to a soft roll at the nape of my neck . Harry had always praised my pallor . He never encouraged me to use rouge , but that night I added a faint color to my cheeks and made my lips more full and red before I went downstairs . " Why , Emily , " Aunt Em greeted me , " you certainly put through your shopping quickly . How well you look , dear ! The trip must have done you good . " I smiled and breathed more easily . I was glad that I had deceived her . It gave me more confidence , and I began hurriedlydelivering messages from Cousin Eunice . We sat there by the fire , waiting for Uncle Wallace 's return and Maggie 's summons to dinner . I took up a piece of knitting I had begun , a child 's sweater for Angeletta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lamplight , and the - stitches formed with mechanical precision , like little marching soldiers under my fingers . Uncle Wallace was in a surprisingly bad humor that night . He was growing more worried about the mill reopeningand recent cancellations of orders . He had asked the banks for an extension of time , and this had been refused . He would have to make a hurried trip the next dayP246to New York , where a group of textile manufacturers were meeting . " Where 's Harry ? " he demanded across the dinner table . " A fine day he chose to be away  --  just when I needed him . " I could feel my heart set up a sudden hammering . I looked at Janice , but her eyes were on her plate . I laid down my knife and fork carefully so that my fingers would not betray me by shaking . " The girls are just back from Boston , " Aunt Em was explaining from her end of the table ; " they would n't know . " " He took the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone when I came back and Old Jo told me Harry had been by for it . " Janice worried a bit of bread into crumbs but gave no other sign . " Well , " Uncle Wallace went on , " he 'll be bringing it back soon , I hope . I left a message with his landlady and the Parkers to have him come and see me when he turns up . I have to go over some important letters with him to-night . " We were having our coffee by the living-room fire when Harry walked in . I was the last to see him because my back was to the door . He was wearing his old tweeds and the sweater I had knitted for him long ago , the one with tawny flecks that matched his freckles and the lights in his eyes . His hair curled from the dampness , and the room seemed suddenly alive and full of his presence . Janiceset down her cup as he came in and went over to the piano . I saw her shuffling through music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my chair . His hands were warm on my shoulders , and his lips brushed the back of my neck , lightly , swiftly , just behind my ears . I twisted my head and tried to smile up at him in easy greeting . He was speaking above me to Uncle Wallace , and I could not follow the motions of his lips . Aunt Em poured him a cup of coffee , and he came round to sit on the sofa and drink it . I must put all my mind on what he says , I told myself . I ca n't afford to miss a word , but I must n't seem too interested . I must be as natural as I can be . " I 'm sorry , sir , " he was answering some question from Uncle Wallace , " I thought they 'd tell you I drove over to Biddeford to see Hawkins about those orders . Things were so quiet this week it seemed a good time to go . " Biddeford , I thought ; that 's a hundred miles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Uncle Wallace was speaking , but I dared not take my eyes from Harry 's face . He sat listening , a trifle uneasily , I thought , for he reached absent-mindedly to add sugar to his cup though he had already dropped in two lumps . " Of course , if I 'd known you were leaving for New York tomorrow I would n't have gone , " Harry went on . " I borrowed the little car . I knew you would n't mind with the girls both away . Good thing I did , too ; the carburetorwas acting up , and Janice had let the oil get low . I had it checked over so the day was n't altogether wasted . " " Where did you have it fixed ? " I found myself asking . " In Biddeford ? " Harry looked surprised at my interest . Neither he nor the others seemed to remember that the little car had originallybeen mine.  | " Oh , some garage along the way . I ca n't remember just where . But it 's set now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piano and poured herself another cup of coffee . Her back was towards me , yet I felt , rather than saw , that she was trying to convey something to him without resorting to words . His eyes were upon her over the rim of his cup . I was aware suddenly of a current of communication between them , a tenseness that each was trying to keep in check . My hands went cold in my lap as I watched them . I knew then for certain what I had fought against believing since morning . I knew  --  because love is plain to those who have ever known it . How long ? I wondered with an inner numbness spreadingover me . How long has it been since I  --  since he  --  since they ... But even in my own mind I could not finish the question . A hand was on my arm . Aunt Em was trying to attract my attention . I forced myself to follow the motion of her lips . " Oh , yes , Aunt Em ! " I started up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll bring them down . " When I returned Harry had gone into the study with Uncle Wallace , and Janice was at the piano again . I felt the vibration of music in the room and though no tune emerged I heard for the third time a distinct sound in my ears . It was clearer than before , and I made a mental note to tell Dr. Vance on my next visit . " Piano , " I would tell him to write in his notes . " Definite response , and more sustained sensation . " I sorted out the various packages for Aunt Em and gave her the sales slips methodically. p 249 " I 'm sorry I could n't find abetter match for blanket binding , " I explained , " but this was the nearest shade . I bought an extra yard just in case you ran short . If you 'll excuse me , Aunt Em , I think I 'll go to bed now . I wo n't wait till Harry 's through talking business . Tell him I have a headache from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I did not wait for her answer . She would only offer aspirin and sympathy , and I had no need of either . Upstairs I slipped out of my dress into my outdoor things and down the back stairs . The flashlight I felt for was in its place on the entry shelf . I followed the little circle of light it made on the steps and graveled drive . The rain was over ; the moon struggling to clear a path among blowing clouds , an old moon toiling through space . I watched it above me and thought that it had never seemed so far , so impersonal on its timeless course . It was dark in the old stable , but my flashlight showed me the two cars in their places . The small one was mudsplashed , the windshield still misty except for the halfcirclethe wiper had kept clear . I slid into the empty seat , letting the beam of light search into every corner . The dashboard pocket held the usual collection of old maps , gloves , matches , and sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had expected to find . Then , as I turned to leave , the light showed a bit of cardboard wedged between the door and running board . It proved to be a parking ticket , damp and torn , but with printing still distinguishable . " Springwood Gar  --  " I made out , and a penciled number below . So I had not been mistaken ! I stuffed the telltale fragmentinto my pocket and sank back on the seat . Up to thatP250moment I had believed that I might be wrong . Now that there could be no more doubt I grew numb and hollow . Life died out of me then . I let the torch grow dark in my hands . I could not think . I could not feel . I just sat there as still as some inanimate fixture of the car . Then I was outside once more , my hands fumbling with the fastenings of the door . A shower of icy drops from a wet low-hanging branch shocked me as they drenched my face . I stopped short on the graveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted windows yellow in the darkness . There were the kitchen panes , the broad bow windows of the living room , and the two set on either side of Uncle Wallace 's desk in the study . Above it my own were bright , and Janice 's also lit . I saw others grow bright and knew that Maggie must be making her evening rounds , turning down bed covers . I could smell the tang of woodsmoke from the chimney . It came strong and fragrant to meet me , and I guessed that someone had just thrown a fresh log on the living-room fire . An old Windsorchair showed its sturdy shape in silhouette against the hall window . It had stood in that exact spot ever since I could remember , and I marked it as one might mark a familiar beacon . Yes , I thought , everything is in its place . Flow ordered and substantial the house and its furnishings appear to someone looking in from the outside as I am looking now ! A stranger might even think that the people in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern of living . I sighed and shivered , knowing that I myself had been deceived into thinking so until a few hours ago . Well , I knew how wrong I had been . For Janice and Harry andp251me at least , the pattern had shifted precariously . I would open the back door and go up the stairs . I would return to those rooms and continue to put on the accustomed habits of nights and days . They must not know that I knew  --  not yet . P252THE HOLIDAYS STRETCHED before me in festive mockery . They would have been difficult enough that year with the mill trouble heavy over us all . I might have been equal to that , but to put a false front on my own despair took all the strength I could muster . Christmas , like spring water , has its source in the heart , and when the heart is frozen or dried up nothing can flow out in a flood of joyous response . Yet one must not betray traditions of good will and joy to the world , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how successful a performance I gave . I only know that I ached dully from the effort I was making . My lips stayed set in a determined smile . I seemed to be carrying myself about , like the stiff wooden figures that ventriloquists manipulate into semblance of life and animation , speaking words for them as they jerk the painted jaws and head . So I went through the days with the cards to be sent and received , with presents leaving and arriving bright in seals and labels that read , " Merry Christmas , " " Please do not open till December 25th. "  |p253I  can recall the very pattern of the brightly printed papers we used for our gifts that year . I can see the stars and bells , the sleigh and reindeer and red-coated figures of the designs , the snow sprinkled over the surface in large conventional dots . Janice never could wrap presents withoutcutting the paper too short or wrinkling it at the corners , and Aunt Em had little knack with her hands and less patience with stickers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be trusted with scissors and ribbon , the task had fallen to me . I had taken pride in my skill , in the neat way I could fold and fit objects to paper with the least possible waste of materials . So , though I could summonno feeling for these pre-holiday rites , my hands still reached mechanically to perform them . Package after package , box after box took on perennial gayety under my fingers ; little silver bells and miniature candles and holly sprigs nestled into tinsel and ribbon as I worked at the long table in the back entry . The Christmas tree kept me company , waiting to be set up according to custom in the bay window on the afternoonof the 24th . It was cooler out there in the entry , and fewer needles would fall than in the heated rooms . I had to endure the bitter spiciness it shed as I worked . Sometimesif my skirt brushed a branch in passing the fragranceengulfed me , and I would lay down the scissors and ribbons because the memory of other Christmases would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them from me . Happinessremembered in pain is like that , I think : we magnifyit till it tricks us like a desert mirage . So the waiting tree became a symbol of my own heart . I felt that year as if I were trimming an inner , secret tree that no one saw , working with feverish zeal to hide t hr bare , stark branches with a load of deceptive tinsel . The days might have been less difficult if Merck Vance had not gone away from Blairstown . Ostensibly he left to spend the holidays with his ' sister in New York , but Dr. Weeks and I both knew the reason for his trip  --  consultationswith medical associates there and in Baltimore . His brief-case bulged with pages of notes on my case history , exhaustive comments , and day-to-day observations on the treatments and my reactions to them . I was amazed and a little awed when he showed me the minute details he had so painstakingly charted . I stared at the closely written pages , and it seemed that they must contain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three months since my first visit to his office . " Yes , " I found myself agreeing to his plans , " I will go on to Baltimore or New York , or wherever you arrange for the further tests and examinations ; but I 'm glad there 's no need of that just yet . " That last visit was unsatisfactory , too full of exhaustive details and instructions . We met in Dr. Weeks ' office , and I missed the familiar intimacy of the smaller one . Dr. Weeks ' presence also made me self-conscious . He had known , of course , about the experiment , but he had had no part in it before . His close friendship with our family kept me from being entirely at my ease . He would continue the treatments during Vance 's absence , and I dreaded that . I feared that I might in some way betray what was on my mind and heart . With Merek Vance it was different . I had never been able to hide anything from him , yet I knew any admission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing for the Blairs and their family relation/ships . I think I had been aware of this from our first meetingand it had lent a kind of confidence to our friendship . Yes , I had to admit that I should miss him , that I had come to depend on him more than I realized till then . There was so much technical discussion between the two doctors that I gave up trying to follow it . I let them talk and test and work over me as if I were a lay figure on which they experimented . All the time I sat there in bleak misery , going over the inescapable fact that I must meet and face . " Janice loves Harry . Harry loves Janice . " Those three words beat on and on in my brain . They had the rhythm of childish ones we used to chalk on sidewalks in gradeschooldays : So-and-so loves So-and-so , with a crudely drawn heart encircling the names to give greater emphasis . But now it was real , not make-believe , love to tease a playmate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged , I supposed a triangle would be substitutedfor the outline of a heart . Well , after all , what was a triangle but a heart with the grace taken out of it ? I opened my eyes , hardly realizing that I had closed them . Merek Vance was touching my arm , and his eyes were kind and full of concern . " You 're tired , " he was saying , " we 've kept you at it too long . But there were so many directions . Dr. Weeks wants to be sure about everything . " " Yes , you 'll be in my hands , Emily . " The older man smiled and wiped his spectacles . " Can you put up with me for a couple of weeks ? " I nodded and patted his hand . " We do n't want any setbacks , you and I , " he was going on . " We 've got a lot to live up to now . . . . I still ca n't quite credit the facts , and when I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  well , it 's all I can do not to shout from the housetop . " " You 'd better not let him , " Vance put in quickly . " We 're agreed on keeping still awhile longer , are n't we ? " I nodded listlessly . " All right , I 've kept medical secrets before , and I can now , " Dr. Weeks promised . " But I must say I do n't see how you can do it , Emily . Think what a Christmas it would make for your aunt and for Harry . . . . You young people have a good deal more restraint than I gave you credit for . " Vance followed me out to the steps , and we both stood there without speaking . It was an awkward interval because we were thinking back to what had happened on our last meeting . I had struck him , and he had kissed me . In those seconds when we had yielded to our impulses we had been completely ourselves as we had never been before , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a hand . I think now that we were too close in that moment for such a conventional exchange of courtesies . " Goodbye , " I said at last . " I guess I ought to try and say Thank you ' ; but that seems foolish and stupid , and I 've been foolish and stupid enough already . " " Oh , we 'll just say you 're human in spite of being a Blairstown Blair and you have n't one speck of complacencyabout you . . . . That 's more than I can say for myself and a lot of other people . " I flushed under his praise , tried to start down the steps , and then came back . " Goodbye , " I said , and added grimly , " I 'm glad you did n't wish me a merry Christmas . " " Why should I ? That 's one thing you 're almost certainp257not to have . But I hope you wo n't mind my thinking of you on the day , because if you ask me not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not answer , and he did not seem to expect me to . " You 'll surely be back the first week in January ? " I said , and he nodded his assurance . " But that 's next year , " I reminded him as I turned to go . " If you count by the calendars , yes ; but I never do it that way . " " How do you count time then ? " " By accomplishment , I guess , or by growth ; that makes it much easier to reckon things . . . . According to that , you and I have known each other more years than we 're old . " I knew he was standing there watching me go down the path between the barberry bushes . I knew he wanted me to look back , but I felt it would be easier to go withoutthat . Then his hand was on my arm . I stopped reluctantlybecause I hated goodbyes , and because already I felt abandoned by the one person from whom I had nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I knew mine would betray me , no matter what contradictory words I might summon . As I turned I saw that he held something out to me . It was the blue box that had belonged to his mother , the one I had reached for in those first difficult visits . He said nothing as he laid it in my hands . " Oh , no ! " I shook my head in vehement protest . " You must n't do that . . . . You said it was your one family heirloom . I could n't take it , not after what you told me  --  " But he , too , shook his head . " You ca n't turn down a Christmas present , " he told me . " I want you to have it . Ever since the first time I saw it in your hands I knew it belonged there . A man may have made it ; but that needle and thread , and that motto , are for a woman . " I stood there not knowing how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking my silence for disapproval that I did not feel . " Call it a present from my mother if you want to . She 'd have liked you to have it . At least she would , once she 'd come to know you . " Tears sprang to my eyes , so that I could not see his face . One splashed on the gay roses , and another on the hearts before I could look up again and follow what he was saying . " I 'm not a sentimentalist about my mother , " he was going on . " She was n't a saint , and I knew it . She was stubborn and proud like you . She went through hell , too  --  not your kind exactly . . . . Love 's simpler over on that side of the river , and all mixed up with hunger and drudgery and physical pain . But hell 's in the same latitude , no matter how we get there . She 'd have known what to say to you now , the way I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to see you through the new year . " Still I stood there , holding his gift , too worn and miserableto speak . " Thank you , " I managed to tell him at last , and I spoke primly in words that came back from formulas of my childhood : " It 's just what I needed . " He could n't help smiling at that , and I smiled too because I must have sounded so politely incongruous . P259I HAD WRITTEN a note to young Jo Kelly asking him to drive out to Angeletta 's place with presents for the children . I had no license to drive the car , so I could not go alone ; and besides I felt the need of Jo 's company . He met me as I had asked him to at the foot of the garden , and we set off with boxes and packages piled about us . He sat with a doll carriage on his knees and a carton of groceries at his feet . Bridget had squirmed into the space between us and tucked her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to go back to the house , but finally her persistence won us over . It always comforted me to feel the wheel under my hands and the reassuring vibration of the engine . It gave me back a sense of lost confidence to be driving the car again over the familiar roads leading out of town . We left early in the afternoon , but already the light seemed thin and waning . Tomorrow would be the winter solstice , and one felt the reluctance of the sun to stay even for its shortestspan . Rains had washed what remained of snow into irregular patches on fields and pastures . There was a clear-  |p260ness  to the outlines of bare trees and bushes as if their twigs had been whittled into sharp relief by wind and frost . In hollows by frozen brooks and ponds the willows showed a purplish tinge at their tips and the far hills were humped in a long procession of darker purple against the sky . The air felt keen , not windy or damp with hint of coming snow , but still and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dark smudges . Few people were out . We had the roads practically to ourselves once we were clear of town , except for an occasional truck or a halfchilledrabbit that scuttled across our way . Neither Jo nor I made any attempt at talk . I had to keep my eyes on the road , and he seemed glad to relax in the seat beside me with the presents and Bridget his only concerns . He had looked tired when we met , and I noticed that his old Mackinaw was still doing duty instead of the overcoat he should have worn in such bleak weather . His hands were bare , and I was glad he kept one on Bridget 's warm fur . Still , there was something strong and alive about him , a driving force that seemed charged by an inner dynamo . One sees the same spirit in birds and small animals that defy winter and its rigors . One can not pity them , for they give the illusion of having chosen their own difficult way ; of preferring scanty fare and cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we drove on , Jo has always been like that , going his own way , believing what he had to believe no matter how unpopular it 's made him . He 'll never fit into any pattern for long ; but wherever he goes people take a sort of answering spark from him , the way animals do . He might have been like St. Francis in another period . The Gallo kitchen was warm and cluttered and full ofP261people . Garlic and strong cheese mingled with the scent of evergreen from a small tree that stood brave in popcorn and fringed-paper garlands . I was glad that I had brought some bells and brightly wrapped candies to add to its decorations . The shy little girl with the enormous eyes had not forgotten me , and Angeletta beamed and made us welcome , shifting the baby to her other arm as she cleared two chairs by the big table . Her husband and father-inlawwere out in the barn . Presently Jo went out to join them while Angeletta and the old woman helped sort and put away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new carriage , and the boy whose operation I had witnessed sat in a wooden packing box and watched us with bright , squirrel-like eyes . His bandages were off , but he still had the peaked , bluish look of a convalescent . " He 's doing good , " Angeletta assured me , " but he ca n't hear right yet  --  " She stopped short and flushed , fearing that she had been treading on dangerous ground . " He will though before long , " I told her . " Dr. Vance says he 's made a remarkable recovery . I knitted him a cap that he can pull down over his ears when he 's able to go out . You 're sure to have a happy Christmas , Angeletta , when you look at him and think what might have been . " " Yes , " she nodded , and reached out with her free hand to touch his round , dark head . " Yes , times are pretty bad , but I guess they could be a lot worse . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't say we ca n't use them . It was real good of you to come , and I 'm glad you brought Jo Kelly . Maybe he can make my Peter feel better . We had to sell the cow last week and we all felt awful bad . " I could think of nothing comforting to say in the face of such elemental loss.  | " Thank God I can nurse the baby , " she went on . " Peter talked to the union about us , and they say they 'll give us some canned milk for the kids . It 'll help out , but it do n't taste the same ; and we sure miss Bossy . " The old woman lighted the oil lamp over the sink and busied herself with the pots on the stove while I talked to Angeletta over the little girl who had climbed on my lap again . " Angie , " I said , " I know this is going to be a bad winter for you all , but it 's worse for those in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the children and pick up bits of coal from the tracks . You 've got some wood cut , and some potatoes and winter vegetables in the cellar . That 's more than they can count on . " " I know , " she nodded . " If it was n't for Peter 's folks I do n't know where we 'd be . Do you think "  --  she leaned forward in her chair , and her eyes were large and anxious in her gaunt face  --  " do you think the mills will reopen and Peter can get on the old shift again ? " I faltered under the question , knowing what my answer must be . " You 'll have to ask Jo Kelly , " I hedged . " He knows more than I do . The mills are going to reopen after New Year 's , but I 'm afraid there 's bound to be even more trouble then . The men on strike wo n't be taken back on the terms they want , and you know what that may mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there sure will be worse trouble . " Her eyes widened and rolled expressively . " But they would n't do that , would they ? They just want to scare the men into making terms . "  |p263I  sighed and hesitated as I straightened the ribbon on the child 's brown hair . " I 'm afraid it 's more than talk , " I said . " You know there 'll be plenty ready to go back on any terms . Too many families are feeling the pinch now . " " I 'd ought to know that ! " Her lips tightened grimly as she spoke . " That 's where they 've got us , and it 's where they want to keep us . I do n't care what you or anyone else says . " There it was , I thought , the word " they " that we all took refuge in . It would always crop up to foster hate and misunderstanding on both sides . Already I could feel Angelettawithdrawing from me , distrustful and wary . " You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mill hand when she was young . I never forget that . " " That 's all right to say , but you never had to stand up eight hours tending the bobbins or looms : Your folks own Peace-Pipe ; I guess you do n't forget that either . " " No , " I admitted , " I do n't . It makes a difference  --  that 's the trouble with me : I have to see both sides and so I just seem to be caught between . " She shifted the baby to her other arm before she went on . " It 's easier to see two sides if you 're not worrying about what you 'll make your next meal of or if your man can weather another week of it . " " I know that  --  at least I 'm beginning to know a little better . Do n't be too hard on me , Angeletta : it 's not going to be exactly a merry Christmas for us either . I needed to come and see you and the children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fun with the things I brought . I liked knitting the sweater and the cap and finding the toys . You do n't mind their having them from me ? " It was strange to be pleading my cause like that , batteringagainst the wall of her pride and bitterness . But Angelettaand I had always liked each other , and the children'seyes turning to the packages helped more than any words of mine . The men came in presently , their breath frosty in the warm room . I was glad of their return , and we all drank a glass of homemade wine that the old man brought out from some mysterious place of hiding . I choked a little over mine , but it warmed me for the trip back in the winter twilight . I let Jo take the wheel for the drive home . It had turned colder , and I was grateful for Bridget 's warmth beside me . The car seemed empty without the oddly shaped parcels that had crowded it on our way out . I dreaded returning to the big house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hateful thing to me , and I resented the need to be furtive and watchful of each move that Janice or Harry might make . Out there in the Gallo kitchen I had been able to forget for a little . At least , if I had not exactly forgotten , the dull ache and despair had retreated while I talked and entered into the problems of their existence . Now the pain sharpened once more as I turned towards Blairstown . Anotherfamily dinner must be faced , another evening must be endured . If Harry came I would be trying to appear natural and at ease . Yet all the time I would be watching for some betrayal if he glanced towards Janice or if she brushed his hand in passing . If he did not appear , if Janice were away or left the house with some flimsy excuse , I must torture myself with fears that might or might not be well founded . I sighed and shrank deeper into my coat asp 265I watched the minute hand of the lighted clock on the dashboard move on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort to talk to Jo Kelly there beside me . I felt a great need of that , and though he knew so little really of my life , and I of his , yet the pull of the old associations always drew us together in spite of our differing worlds , " Jo , " I spoke as I saw the brightly lighted windows of the roadside diner just ahead . " How about stopping here for a cup of coffee ? " He swung the car in and parked it obediently near by . A loaded truck had stopped too . We could see two men seated at the counter , but otherwise the place was deserted . I saw young Jo notice that before he followed me in . We took the corner table , where Merek Vance and I had sat at a far later hour . " I should n't have asked you to come in here with me , " I said after my first sip of coffee . " I 'm not exactly the company you want to be seen with nowadays , am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not deny the charge . It was a new sensation to feel that I must apologize for my presence ; to feel that there were those who would consider me an undesirable companion . " I guess your friends do n't think very highly of me , Jo , " I went on , " and I would n't want to get you into trouble . " " I 'm used to taking care of myself , " he answered shortly . " But you do n't belong just to yourself , at least not any more , " I pointed out . " You seem to stand for a lot of people . You 'd have some explaining to do if any of your union friends happened to walk in here now and saw us sitting like this ? "   " Maybe , " he admitted , and this time he did not smile . " Jo "  --  I set down my half-empty cup and reached for a cigarette  --  " where 's it going to end ? One side or the other has got to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know that much . " The tired lines of his face that had relaxed a little over the coffee and cigarettes , sharpened again as he looked up . No one could look into young Jo Kelly 's eyes without trusting him , I thought , while I waited for his answer . " It all depends on how many of us can hold out , " he told me , " and for how long . " " But , Jo , even if your union and their sympathizers help out with funds there are months of winter ahead for all those families like the Gallos . You saw what I saw over there this afternoon , and they 're luckier than most . . . . How can you expect them to hold out on nothing ? " " That 's what we 're up against , " he said . He rose then and went over to a big machine that dealt out popular music . I saw him put in some coins , and I felt the place vibrate to sound before he returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive that I could make out the steady blaring of jazz though I could not yet recognize tunes as I listened . Mentally I made a note to tell Merek Vance of this and my response to the machine . " Thought our voices might carry over to the counter , " Jo explained when he returned to his place . " Ca n't run the chance of any one thinking I talk out of turn . The noise wo n't bother you any , and I can hear you through it . Go ahead . " " It 's you I 'm asking , Jo . " He shrugged wearily and shook his head . " Well , " I went on , " at least tell me this :  |p267there  wo n't be violence when the mill reopens . Your picketswo n't start that kind of trouble , will they ? " Again his face seemed to shrink into old , anxious lines , and only his eyes stayed young and eager . " Not if I can stop it , " he told me at last . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the long run . I 'm doing all I can to keep this strike a clean one . They listen to me now , but I ca n't guarantee they will later  --  " A spasm of coughing shook him , and I missed the rest of his words . " You mean , " I asked , " that they may get out of hand when Peace-Pipe reopens ? " He nodded . " It 'll take them one way or the other then . Plenty will turn scab and go back : half a loaf 's better than nothing , they figure . I have a hunch Peter Gallo will go that way . Those that stick to their guns  --  well , you ca n't blame them for pulling the trigger , can you ? " I shook my head . Tears rose to my eyes because I felt suddenly very tired and baffled . " I do n't blame anybody for anything , " I faltered across the white-topped table . " I 'm very unhappy , Jo . No , " I hurried on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , I ca n't tell you why . It 's nothing you could do anything about . But somehow when you 're unhappy you draw other people 's unhappinesses and troubles to you . I suppose it 's like reaching out to like , because it used to be the other way round when I was happy . Do you know what I mean ? " I do n't know what he may have answered . My eyes were too wet to see his face except as a blur . But I felt the quick response of his hand on mine , and I was grateful forP268that pressure . It had helped to say even so little to him . Sometimes a sudden rush of tears sharpens the sight as a quick shower clears the air of impurities . I looked straight into Jo Kelly 's eyes and saw my own face mirrored in the shining darkness of those pupils . I wondered if he were seeing his face in mine , and if he felt reassured as I did by the reflection . When I forget Jo Kelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past remembering anything that matters . We talked on there under the hard , glaring lights of the roadside diner . It was always easy for me to follow him , perhaps because we had grown up together and I knew his way of speech so well . Then , too , he always listenedintently and gave himself completely to the other person . I think that was one reason why people turned to him as they did . I wish I could recall word for word all that he told me . At the time I seemed to understand the issues and problems that had bewildered me for so long . He made me see Peace-Pipe strike in simple terms , not in a confusing jumble of technical phrases and abbreviations that stood for this labor organization or that . But now only a few of his words return to me . They stir in my consciousnessall these months afterward , like last year 's leaves from some tree we shall never see putting out new ones in the spring . " Men with wives and kids ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I remember he said . " Todaymatters more than any tomorrow to them . It 's bound to be that way when you 've got a family to do for . That 's why it 's up to me to do more than the rest about holding on and speaking up . You 're not the first to ask about the union letting us down , maybe even selling us out . It 's hap/pened before , and it might again . Still , I figure what 's right stays right , no matter how many knocks it gets . " " But that 's the hard part , " I broke in , " to feel sure you know what 's right ! I get pulled in so many directions . I keep remembering what Maggie used to tell us when - we were little : There 's not the thickness of a penny between good and evil ! ' " We both smiled at that , remembering the times she had quoted it to us when we used to raise childish arguments if she caught us red-handed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had felt as close as we did that afternoon . It comforts me now to remember that it was so . If we had guessed all that lay ahead I think we could n't have made better use of that half-hour together . The men left the counter and went out to their truck . We watched its tail lights dwindle to red specks in the darkness and then go out like sparks . One or two other customers came in , but they stayed at the counter ; and after quick glances at them Jo relaxed and we could go on talking . " Whatever happens "  --  his words come back to me now with a queer twinge of pain  --  " we 've made a dent that may count next time . It takes a lot of hammering to break through any wall or any system . " " If the men only did n't hate us so ! " I told him . " At least that 's what Uncle Wallace says . And then he says they 'll come round and want to be friendly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsistent ? " " That 's because they 're like a bunch of kids . " He surprised me by a kind of tolerant wisdom , as if he were already years older than his cronies . " A lot of them have n't ever stopped going to grade school in their feelings : an apple for teacher one day and wanting to burn the school- house down the next . That 's why it 's so hard to organize them and make them stay organized . " Our coffee cups had been empty for a long time , but still we sat on , reluctant to leave and go our separate ways . I felt that he was clinging to the mood and the moment even as I was . " Well , it 's good we can still keep on being friends , " I told him before I gathered up my things to leave . " Yes , " he agreed . And then he added with the nearest approach to bitterness that he ever expressed : " Plenty of people are your friends till you need them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the door . I glanced at it and pushed back my chair . " Remember I 'm trying to see your side , too , Jo , " I said . " But it 's hard being tied so fast to the other , and  --  and beingdeaf does n't help , you know . " He leaned across the table as if he must make me feel the words that I have cherished ever since . " I wish a lot of people who can hear would try as hard to understand , " he said . " You 've never been deaf to me . " P271I NEED NOT HAVE dreaded that Christmas so , for as it turned out our household was far from festive when the day arrived . Aunt Em was the cause of this , and she never knew that her accident and suffering helped me through the holidays as nothing else could have done . It happened at dusk of Christmas Eve . She had been out , winding up a few last errands , and had walked back from the shopping district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when distance was not too great . She prided herself on her activity and independence , and her energy and endurance had become a byword with all the family . " Aunt Em can run me ragged in an hour , " Janice used to complain . And I would agree on that subject . " Too bad they ca n't put her in the picket line , " Harry had laughed during the first days of the strike . " There 'd be no wearing her down if she believed in the cause . " Poor Aunt Em , it seems strange to think that we ever made such jokes about her ; that so short a time ago she came and went as she pleased on legs that are helpless now under the striped afghan . P272None of us will ever know exactly how it happened . The day had been one of doors opening and shutting and the confusion of arrivals and departures . Janice was off in the car , and I had been late going to Dr. Weeks for my treatment . He had been delayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest instructions from Merck Vance . These had been to double the strength of the injections , and he had been anxious to do so with as little discomfort as possible . " We 'd better skip the treatments tomorrow , " I said as I left . " It 's hardly a day I can slip over here unnoticed . Besidesyou 'll be with us for dinner . " There were lights in the church that faced the Square , and I knew the greens must be up for the evening service . Behind the bare branches of elms and maples I could see the strong reds and yellows and blues of the stained-glass windows that had been familiar to me since childhood . There was the one of Christ blessing little children given in memory of Grandmother Blair , and the one about the parable of the loaves and fishes in memory of Grandfather Blair , and the one above the chancel given by Aunt Em and Uncle Wallace after my father 's death in memory of him and the other Blairstown men who had lost their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's leash fast to a post and slipped into the empty church . The sextonwas just finishing with the decorations at the far end of the long aisle , and the fragrance of fir and spruce boughs met me in spicy warmth as I pushed open the door . The glowing scarlet of poinsettia plants was like tongues of flame under the chancel lights . The rest of the church was dim , the organ pipes mounting tall and golden into the shadowy arches . Just so they had looked to me in the daysP273when my head hardly showed above our pew top ; just so had the Christmas greens smelled then , aromatic and rich to my nostrils . I sank down in a back pew , hoping to ease the tightness that had held me fast for days ; but the old faith and assurance of childhood would not come out of the dimness to take me again . As I rose to go I stood a moment before my father 's bronze tablet with its inscription beginning , " ' I'o the glory of God , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great need of my father , I read and reread these words . But they only made him seem farther away . So 1 turned at last and tiptoed out , knowing that if he could have returnedon Christmas Eve the years would have made me more of a stranger to him than he was to me . It was almost dark when I reached our driveway , and I was annoyed by Bridget 's behavior . She kept tugging at the leash , butting her head against my legs and trying to dash off towards the garden . I did my best to discipline her , but she only grew more insistent as I tried to drag her up the steps . At last I gave in and followed her lead . That was how I came upon Aunt Em , a helpless and crumpled heap by the side doorsteps . I have a confused memory of what happened after that : of Maggie and Old Jo Kelly and myself carrying her into the entry between us ; of the sharpness of spirits of ammoniaand brandy spilled in the effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we waited for Dr. Will ; of awkwardattempts to remove wraps and warm her icy hands . The Christmas tree still stood there waiting to be set up and decorated . I saw Aunt Em 's eyes turn towards it as I lifted her head to a pillow . Her face was distorted with pain , but she turned her eyes to the tree and then to me.  | I knew she was making wordless apology for such a catastropheon Christmas Eve . Catastrophe it surely was  --  a far more serious fall than we guessed until we saw Dr. Will 's face as he worked over her . Maggie and I gave ourselves up to following directions , Maggie at the telephone and I running up and down stairs bringing blankets and robes and more pillows . It was a broken hip , Dr. Will managed to tell me when he could take me aside for a moment . He suspected it was a compoundfracture that had not been helped by Aunt Em 's struggles to rise and our clumsy efforts to carry her in . She must be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be put on . If only Merek Vance were within call ... I was thinking that , too , as I did the few simple things I could before the ambulance arrived and as I sat on the little folding seat beside the stretcher . I held Aunt Em 's cold hand , and tried to be reassuring though I winced in sympathy at every turn and jolt of the short journey . Aunt Em had protested feebly when Dr. Weeks had mentioned the hospital . She was n't used to having her wishes overruled , but she had given in finally . It was touching to me to see her dependence on him . Even in the stress of those moments I realized that she counted on him as more than a doctor and more than a friend . But for myself I suddenlyfelt lost and alone , knowing that Merek Vance would not be waiting for us at the hospital in his white coat , with his skillful , hard-scrubbed hands ready to do their best for us . The Blair Memorial Hospital and Clinic had been built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our family had ever made use of it before thatp275night . The resident doctor and staff of nurses could n't do enough for Aunt Em 's comfort . Indeed , the whole machineryof the place was presently revolving about her . I know that pleased her even in the midst of her pain . It seemed to give her back an old assurance in family traditions . I hoped that the present and its problems would retreatfor her and she could rest for a while on the old formula of the past . " But how did she do it ? " Uncle Wallace kept asking as he and I waited in the impersonal cheerfulness of the visitors ' reception room . He had returned from the mill just in time to see the ambulance leaving the driveway and had hurried on to join me at the hospital . " She went out to do some errands , " I told him , " and coming back she slipped on the side steps . You know how the eaves drip and the water freezes after the sun goes down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . " " It would have to happen on Christmas Eve . " Uncle Wallace shook his head and relighted the cigar that kept going out as we waited there together . " Em 's bound to blame herself for spoiling the holiday for the rest of us . Seems to me they 're taking longer than they should with those X-rays . " I looked at the clock in the hall outside and saw that it was exactly seven minutes since she had been carried into the X-ray room . I reached for a current magazine and turned the pages with determined absorption . In that next hour and a half I knew the pictures of every article and story by heart and all the products advertised on the pages . I knew the pattern of the chintz curtains as if I had designedthem , and I had counted over and over the colored bulbs on a small Christmas tree the nurses had set up
