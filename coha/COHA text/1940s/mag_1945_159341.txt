Few of the 250,000 U.S. soldiers , sailors and marines who lost their lives in World War II had ever said where they wanted their bodies to lie . Of the combat troops polled on the question early this year by TIME Correspondent Robert Sherrod , the great majority hoped that they would be buried near the scene of their last battle , with their comrades-in-arms . But war widows and parents , by &; large , do not share these sentiments ; by last week , the War Department alone had received nearly 90,000 letters from next of kin who want their soldiers ' bodies brought back to the U.S. for reburial . <P> Congress heeded the expressed views of the quick , who have votes , rather than the imperfectly known wishes of the dead . Assured of passage in the House before Christmas was a bill directing the Secretary of War to return the body of a member of any of the armed forces , on request of the next of kin . <P> Soon both War &; Navy will be addressing letters to families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Present estimates are that at least 70% ( some say as high as 95% ) will reply , " Please bring him back . " The War Department is studying a plan whereby , after an overseas cemetery has been 60% evacuated by request , the other 40% will be evacuated without request . This would almost certainly mean the abandonment of all far-flung World War II cemeteries-from Iwo Jima to Salerno-where U.S. dead have been laid to rest . Incomplete records listed 122,000 buried in the European Theater , 41,000 in the Mediterranean , 29,000 in the Southwest Pacific , 11,000 in Pacific Ocean areas . The cost of exhuming and transshipping all the shattered , canvas-wrapped remains might run to $200 million . The cost in reborn grief is beyond measure . <P> God 's Acres . The question of where to rebury these war dead has stirred up more controversy than whether to bring them back . Congress favored a plan to establish 79 new national cemeteries-at least one in each state-with plots for 5,400,000 . Original cost : $123,000,000 ; annual maintenance : a maximum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran head-on into representatives of private cemetery interests . To the cemetery associations , the plan was a tax-consuming monster , violating the " American tradition " under which , they said , the soldier preferred to lie among members of his own family , in a graveyard in his own community , in ground consecrated according to the rites of his creed . The cemetery associations wanted Congress to allot families a set sum for private burials . Private cemeteries , they claimed , have enough vacant plots for 200 years .
