He carries a hard-boiled egg around with him for luck . " " Carrying a hard-boiled egg around for luck , " Bess said , " is superstition . " " Well , what 's the difference ? " Homer said .

She brought with her a small Woolworth bowl and put it on the table . Homer got up . " Here , Mary , " he said . " Sit down and have breakfast with us . " " I just had breakfast with Papa and sent him to work , " Mary said . " Thanks just the same . I brought some stewed dried peaches that I made for Papa , Mrs. Macauley .

Times have changed . I honest-to-goodness would like to go out and find myself a job somewhere . " " And so would I , " Bess said . " Nonsense , " Mrs. Macauley said . " You 're both children  --  Seventeen years old . Your father has a good job , Mary , and your brother , Bess . " " But it just does n't seem right , Mrs. Macauley , " Mary said .

" " Well , " Mary said , " I hope so , " and then went along with her friend Bess Macauley to school . Homer watched the girls go . After a moment he spoke . " What about that , Ma ? " he said . " Why , it 's perfectly natural , " Mrs. Macauley said , " for a couple of girls to want to get out and flap their wings . " " I do n't mean wanting to get out and flap their wings , " Homer said . " I mean Mary . " " Mary is a sweet , unaffected , childlike girl , " Mrs. Macauley said . " She is the most childlike girl I 've ever known , and I 'm glad Marcus is in love with her . Marcus could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Homer said impatiently , " I know all about that . That is n't what I 'm talking about . Do n't you see ? " He paused , then added suddenly as if it were no use trying to talk about the feeling he had  --  the feeling that there would be pain out of the War for many people who would never get near it . " Oh , well , I 'll see you tonight when I get home . So long . " Mrs. Macauley watched him go , wondering whatThe Human Comedyit was he had wanted to tell her . Suddenly out of the corner of her eye she saw somebody  --  very small . It was Ulysses in his nightshirt . He looked up at her , almost as a small animal looks up at that creature of its kind which is its greatest delight and comfort . The expression of his face was deeply serious and incredibly charming . Ulysses said , " Why does he say , Weep no more , Weep no more ' ? " " Who ? " Mrs. Macauley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's a song , Ulysses , " Mrs. Macauley said . She took his hand . " Come on , now , put on your clothes . " " Will the black man be on the train again today ? " the little boy said . Mrs. Macauley thought a moment . " Yes , " she said . RABBITS AROUND HERESOMEWHEREOn his way to school Homer Macauley passed a picket fence protecting an empty lot full of weeds on San Benito Avenue . The fence was old and rotten and had no use other than to ornament with majestic ridicule a small area of waste , and to protect a bored group of weed tribes which surely needed no protection . The daytime school student and nighttime telegraph messenger brought his bicycle to a dynamicskidding halt , dropped the contraption and hurried to the fence as if there he would discover something extremely fleeting and apt to be lost if47The Human Comedyhe did not hurry . The fence was about a foot higher than the regulation low hurdles , and as for anything fleeting being there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftness that would take a century . Homer studied the fence , the area beyond it , the running area before it , and then measured the height of the fence , which was considerably above his waist . He now rehearsed a few jumps , went back ten yards , and then without any announcement from himself to himself he turned in a fury and ran toward the fence . When he was near enough he made a beautiful hurdle , kicked the fence , knocked clown part of it , and himself fell in the weeds , but got right up and went back for another try . The wood of the fence broke easily , making a sound that was nobly unnecessary and therefore comical . Altogether Homer made seven tries , not one ol which was successful . He stopped only when the whole fence had been brought down into still greater ruin . An old man with a walking stick came out of the house across the street , smoking a pipe , and quietly watched Homer . Just as Homer was getting up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke . " What are you doing ? " he said . " Hurdling , " Homer said . " Hurt yourself ? " " Naaah , " Homer said . " The fence is a little too high , that 's all . The weeds are slippery too . " Rabbits Around Here SomewhereThe old man looked at the weeds a moment and then said , " Those are milkweeds . They make very good feed for rabbits . Rabbits like them . I used to have a hutch of rabbits about eleven years ago , but somebody opened the door in the middle of the night and they all ran away . " " What did he open the door for ? " Homer said . " Well , I do n't know , " the old man said . " I never did find out who did it . I lost thirty-three head of the prettiest rabbits you ever saw . Pink-eyes , catfaces , Belgians , and two or three other kinds  --  never did find out . " " You like rabbits ? " Homer said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man said . " Domestic rabbits are very mild-mannered . " The man looked around among the weeds of the empty lot . " Thirty-three rabbits out in the open for eleven years , " he said . " Well , there 's no telling how many of them there are now  --  not the way they breed  --  or how wild they are , either . I would n't be surprised , " he said , " if this whole city is full of wild rabbits now . " I never see any of them , " Homer said . " Maybe not , " the old man said . " But they 're here  --  somewhere . The whole city 's overrun with them , most likely . A couple more years and they 'll be a serious problem . " Even so , Homer got on his bike . " Well , " he said , " I got to go now . I 'll be seeing you . " " You bet , " the old man said . " My name 's Charles48 11 49The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . You 're welcome to it . " " Yes , sir , " Homer said . Then he went back to his own theme . " Going to run the two-twenty low hurdles at the high school track meet this afternoon , " he told the old man . " Never did go to high school myself , " the old man said , " but I fought in the Spanish-American War . " " Yes , sir , " Homer said . " Well , so long ! " " Oh , yes , " the old man said , but he was talking to himself . " Spanish-American War , " he said . " Ran like a rabbit half the time . " Homer disappeared around the corner on his bicycle . The old man strolled back to his little brokendownhouse , puffing his pipe and looking around . He poked his walking stick into a big weed . " Rabbitsaround here somewhere , " he said . " Wild by this time  --  not the way they used to be . " 50CHAPTER 10ANCIENT HISTORYOn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hurdles were set for the 22o-yard low hurdle race . Now , in the morning , four boys were running a practice race . Each ran well , under control , and each hurdled with good form . Coach Byfield , stop-watch in hand , came up to the winner . " That was better , Ackley , " he said to a boy who was surely not common , but for all that surely not terribly uncommon either . He was a boy who had the resigned manner of one whose family had not in recent decades been in want of food , clothing or51The Human Comedy Ancient Historyshelter , who on occasion entertained others of similargood fortune . " You 've got a lot to learn yet , " the coach said to the boy , " but I think you will be able to win the race this afternoon . " " I 'll try my best , sir , " the boy said . " Yes , I know , " the coach said . " You wo n't be havingany competition today , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Valley Meet . Go to the shower now and take it easy until this after-noon . " " Yes , sir , " the boy replied . He moved away , then stopped suddenly . " Excuse me , sir , " he said . " How is my time ? " " Not bad , " the coach said , " but not too good either . I would n't worry about the time , though . Just run the race I 've taught you to run , and I think you 'll come in first . " The other three runners were over to one side , watching and listening . " He may act like a sissy , " one of the boys said to the others , " but he always comes in first . What 's the matter with you , Sam ? " " What 's the matter with me ? " Sam said . " What 's the matter with you ? Why do n't you beat him ? " " I came in second . " " Second 's no better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ackley the Third , beating us ! " Sam said . " We ought to be ashamed of ourselves . " 52 " Sure , " the second boy said , " but we 've got no alibis . He just runs a better race , that 's all . " The coach turned to these three and in an altogetherdifferent tone of voice , he said , " O.K. , you guys  --  keep moving . You 're not so good you can stand around and be proud of yourselves . Get to your marks and give it another try . " Without a word the boys went to their marks and the coach sent them off for another run of the race . After they began to run , the coach decided he would run them a couple more times before the afternoon meet . He seemed to want Hubert Ackley III to win the race . The ancient history classroom was swiftly filling as the teacher , old Miss Hicks , waited for the final bell and the kind of order and quiet which in her class was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem of trying to educate , if not entertain , the boys and girls of Ithaca , now at high school and soon , at least theoretically , to be ready for the ' world . Homer Macauley , troubled by something that bordered on a state of adoration , studied a girl named Helen Eliot who walked from the door to her desk . Without a doubt this girl was the most beautiful girl in the world . Besides that , she was a snob which Homer refused to believe was natural or permanent Even so , and even though he worshipedher , the bitterest enemy of his school life was this snobbery of Helen Eliot . Following her53The Human Comedy Ancient Historycame Hubert Ackley III . When Hubert reached Helen the two whispered a moment , irritating Homer very much . The final bell rang , and the teacher said , " All right . Silence , please . Who 's ab-sent ? " " I am , " a boy said . His name was Joe Terranova , and he was the low comedian of the class . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of his comic religious cult , his worshipers , were instant in their response and appreciation of his swift and goofy wit . But Helen Eliot and Hubert Ackley turned and frowned at these Holy Rollers of the classroom , these bad-mannered offspring of slum-dwellers . This in turn angered Homer so much that when everyone else had ceased laughing he burst out with an artificial " Ha-ha-ha , " which he sent almost directly into the faces of Ilubert , whom he despised , and Helen , whom he adored . Then he turned swiftly to Joe and said , " As for you , Joe , shut up when Miss Hicks is talking . " " Now , none of your nonsense , Joseph , " Miss Hicks said . And turning to Homer , " Or yours , young man . " She paused a moment to look the class over . " Now , " she said , " we will take up the Assyrians where we left off yesterday . I want everyone 's undividedattention  --  everyone 's continuous undivided attention . First we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oral discussion of what we have read . " The low comedian could not resist this opportunity for horseplay . " No , Miss Hicks , " he suggested . " Let 's not discuss it orally . Let 's discuss it silently , so I can sleep . " Again the faithful roared with laughter and the snobs turned away , disgusted . Miss Hicks did not answer the comedian immediately , for on the one hand it was difficult not to enjoy the swiftness of his wit and on the other hand it was equally difficult to know how to cope with him so that the wit would continue . And yet it was absolutelynecessary to keep him in line . At last she spoke . " You must not be unkind , Joseph , " she said , " especially when it happens that you are right and  --  I am wrong . " " Well , I 'm sorry , Miss Hicks , " the comedian said . " I guess I just ca n't help it . Oral discussion ! What other kind of discussion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , with a kind of spoofing of himself and of his own presumptuousness , he waved to her , sayingpatronizingly , " Go ahead , Miss Hicks . " " Thank you , " the teacher said . " Now , everybody  --  wide awake ! " " Wide awake ! " Joe said . " Look at them  --  they 're all half asleep . " Even though the old teacher was enjoying Joe 's sallies , it was necessary for her to say , " Another interruption , Joseph , and I will have to ask you to go to the principal 's office . " " I 'm only trying to get myself a little education , " the comedian said . " But just look at them . They're54 55The Human Comedyhalf asleep , are n't they ? " And then he surveyed the faces of the pupils of the classroom and added , " All my pals , too . Great baseball players . " " Ah , shut up , Joe , " Homer said to his friend . " You do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart you are . " " Not another word , " Miss Hicks said . " Not another word from either one of you . Now , " she said , " turn to page 1 17 , paragraph two . " Everyone turned to this page and found the place . " Ancient history , " the teacher continued , " may seem to be a dull and unnecessary study . At a time like the present , when so much history is going on in our own world , anotherworld  --  long since ended  --  may seem useless to study and understand . Such a notion , however , is incorrect . It is very important for us to know of other times , other cultures , other peoples , and other worlds . Who 'll volunteer to come to the head of the class and read ? " Two girls and Hubert Ackley III raised their hands . Joe , the comedian , turned to Homer , and said , " Look at that guy , will you ? " Of the two girls who had volunteered the teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fascinated , watched her walk to the front of the class . She just stood there , being very beautiful for a moment , and then in the purest and most attractivevoice imaginable she began to read , while Homer marveled at the incredible miracle of such a body and such a voice. 56Ancient History " The Assyrians , " Helen Eliot read , " long of nose , hair and beard , developed Nineveh in the north to a position of great power . After many vicissitudes with the Hittites , Egyptians and others , they conqueredBabylon under the reign of Tiglath Pileser the First , in eleven hundred B.C. For centuries afterward , the power veered between Nineveh built of stone and Babylon built of brick . There is no connectionbetween the names Syrian ' and Assyrian , ' and the Assyrians were to fight the Syrians until Tiglath Pileser the Third conquered them and exiled the ten lost tribes of Israel . " Helen paused for a fresh supply of breath with which to read the next paragraph , but before she could begin to read again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Third ? Who did he conquer , or what did he do ? " The well-bred boy got to his feet in a kind of decent bitterness . " Miss Hicks , " he said very earnestly , " I can not allow such willful mischievousness to go uncorrected or unpunished . I must ask you to order Mr. Macauley to go to the principal 's office  --  or , " he said very deliberately , " I shall have to take the matter into my own hands . " Homer jumped out of his seat . " Ah , shut up , " he said . " Your name is Hubert Ackley the Third is n't it ? Well , what did you ever do , or for that matter what did Hubert Ackley the Second ever do , or what did Hubert Ackley the First ever do ? " He paused a moment and turned to Miss Hicks and57The Human Comedy Ancient Historythen to Helen Eliot . " I think that 's a good intelligentquestion , " he said . Then he turned to Hubert Ackley and repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , " Hubert said , " at least no Ackley has ever been a common  --  " He stopped to seek an appropriatelywithering word , and then said , "  --  fanfaron , " a word nobody else in Ithaca had ever heard before . " Fanfaron ? " Homer said . He turned to the teacher . " What 's that mean , Miss Hicks ? " he said . As she was not ready with a definition of the word , Homer turned quickly to Hubert Ackley and went on , " Listen , number three , " he said , " do n't be callingme names I never even heard before . " " A fanfaron , " Hubert said , " is a hoodlum  --  a braggart . " And he stopped to find another , lower word . " Ah , shut up , " Homer said . He turned to Helen Eliot and smiled the famous Macauley smile . " Fanfaron ! " he repeated . " What kind of cussing is that ? " Then he sat down . Helen Eliot waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miss Hicks , however , did not give the sign . Finally Homer understood . He got to his feet and said to Hubert Ackley III , " All right , I apologize . I 'm sorry . " " Thank you , " the well-bred boy said , and sat down . The ancient-history teacher looked about the room a moment and then said , " Homer Macauleyand Hubert Ackley will remain in their seats after school . " " But , Miss Hicks , " Homer said , " what about the school track meet ? " " I 'm not interested in the school track meet , " the teacher said . " The development of your manners is as important as the development of your bodies . Perhapsmore important . " " Miss Hicks , " Hubert Ackley said , " Ithaca High School is counting on me to win the two-twenty low hurdle race this afternoon and two weeks from now to make a good showing in the Valley Track Meet . I 'm afraid Coach Byfield will insist on my taking part . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Homer said , " but I 'm going to run the two-twenty low hurdles this afternoon  --  that 's all . " Hubert Ackley looked at Homer . " I had no idea , " he said , " you had gone out for that race . " " Well , " Homer said , " I have . " He turned to the teacher . " Miss Hicks , if you let us go this time , I promise never again to make any trouble or to be disobedient or anything . And so does Hubert . " he turned to Hubert and said , " Do n't you ? " " Yes , I do , Miss Hicks , " Hubert said . " You will both stay in after school , " the ancienthistoryteacher said . " Helen , please continue to read . " " The allied armies , " Helen read , " of the Chaldeansfrom the south and the Medes and PersiansThe Human Comedyfrom the north overcame the Assyrian empire and Nineveh bowed to their might . Nebuchadnezzar the Second ruled over the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Persia , with his hordes of invaders . His conquest , however , was only one of a cycle , for the descendants of this army would later be subjugated by Alexander the Great . " Homer , disgusted now , tired from the work of the night before and lulled by the sweet voice of the girl he believed was made only for himself , slowly dropped his head on his folded arms and began to enjoy something almost the equivalent of sleep . Still he could hear the girl reading . " From this melting pot , " she read , " the world has a heritage of great value . The Mosaic code of the Bible owes some of its principles to some of the laws formulated by I-Iammurabi , who was called the lawgiver . From their system of arithmetic , in which they used the multiple of twelve as well as our familiar ten , we derive our sixty minutes to the hour and 36o degrees to the circle . Arabia gave us our numerals , which are still called Arabic to distinguish them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sundial . The modern apothecarysymbols and the signs of the Zodiac originated with the Babylonians . Comparatively recent excavationsin Asia Minor have revealed that there was a magnificent empire there . " " A magnificent empire ? " Homer dreamed . " Where ? Ithaca ? Ithaca in California ? Away out to6oAncient Historyhell and gone ? Without any great people , without any great discoveries , without sundials , without numerals , without Zodiacs , without humor , without anything ? Where was this great empire ? " He decided to sit up again and look around . He saw only the face of Helen Eliot , perhaps the greatest empire of them all , and he heard her wondrous voice , perhapsthe greatest achievement of pathetic mankind . " The Hittites , " she said , " had swung down the coast and over into Egypt . They mingled their blood with the Hebrew tribes and gave to the Hebrews the Hittite nose . " Helen stopped reading and turned to the ancienthistoryteacher . " That 's the end of the chapter , Miss Hicks , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thank you for an excellent reading . You may be seated . " 6rCHAPTER I1A SPEECH ON THE HUMANNOSEMiss Hicks waited for Helen to take her seat and then looked over the faces of her pupils . " Now , " she said , " what have we learned ? " " That people all over the world have noses , " Homer said . Miss Hicks was not upset by this reply and took it for what it was worth . " What else ? " she said . " That noses , " Homer said , " are not only for blowingor to have colds in but also to keep the record of ancient history straight . " Miss Hicks turned away from Homer and said , 62A Speech on the Human Nose " Someone else , please . Homer seems to have been carried away by the noses . " " Well , it 's in the book , is n't it ?

" " Well , " Homer said , " maybe not exactly a speech  --  but ancient history tells us one thing . " Slowly now , and with a kind of unnecessary emphasis , he continued , " People have always had noses . To prove it all you have to do is look around at everybody in this classroom . " He looked around at everybody . " Noses , " he said , " all over the place . " He stopped a moment to decide what else would be possible to say on this theme . " The nose , " he decided to say , " is perhaps the most ridiculous part of the human face . It has always been a source of embarrassment to the human race , and the Hittites probably beat up on everybody because their noses were so big and crooked . It does n't matter who invented the , sundial because sooner or later somebody invents a watch . The important thing is , Who 's got the noses ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not envy . Homer continued . " Some people , " he said , " talk through their noses . A great many people snore through their noses , and a handful of people whistle or sing through them . Some people are led around by their noses , others63The Human Comedyuse the nose for prying and poking into miscellaneousplaces . Noses have been bitten by mad dogs and movie actors in passionate love stories . Doors have been slammed on them and they have been caught in egg-beaters and automatic record changers . The nose is stationary , like a tree , but being on a movable object  --  the head  --  it suffers great punishmentby being taken to places where it is only in the way . The purpose of the nose is to smell what 's in the air , but some people sniff with the nose at other people 's ideas , manners , or appearances . " He turned and looked at Hubert Ackley III and then at Helen Eliot , whose nose , instead of moving upward , for some reason went slightly downward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally hold their noses toward heaven , as if that were the way to get in . Most animals have nostrils but few have noses , as we understand noses , yet the sense of smell in animalsis more highly developed than in man  --  who has a nose , and no fooling . " Homer Macauley took a deep breath and decided to conclude his speech . " The most important thing about the nose , " he said , " is that it makes trouble , causes wars , breaks up old friendships , and wrecks many happy homes . Now can I go to the track meet , Miss Hicks ? " The ancient-history teacher , although pleased with this imaginative discourse on a trivial theme , would not allow its success to interfere with the need for her to maintain order in her classroom .

" Big noses are generally on navigators and explorers , " a girl said . " All two-headed boys have two noses , " Joe said . " The nose is never on the back of the head , " one of Joe 's admirers said . " Somebody else , " Miss Hicks said . She turned to a boy and said his name . " Henry ?

Moses 's nose was a big nose . " 64 65The Human Comedy " Ah , " Joe said . " You 'll never learn anything . You 'll die in the poorhouse . Moses had a nose as big as most noses ! Henry , you 've got to get that straight . Now think about it . " " All right , now , " Miss Hicks said , " anybody else ?

" " That 's beside the point , " the ancient-history teacher said . " Somebody else now ? " But it was too late . The class bell rang . Everyone got up to leave for the track meet except Homer Macauley and Hubert Ackley III. 66CHAPTER 12THE TWO-TWENTY LOWHURDLE RACEThe boys ' athletic coach of Ithaca High School stood in the office of the principal of Ithaca High School  --  a man whose last name was Ek , a circumstanceduly reported by Mr. Robert Ripley in a daily newspaper cartoon entitled " Believe It or Not . " Mr. Ek 's first name was Oscar , and not worthy of notice . " Miss Hicks , " the principal of Ithaca High School said to the coach of Ithaca High School , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had at this school . She was my teacher when I attended Ithaca High School and she was your teacher , too , 67The Human ComedyMr . Byfield . I 'm afraid I would n't care to go over her head about punishing a couple of unruly boys . " " Hubert Ackley the Third is not an unruly boy , " the coach said . " Homer Macauley  --  yes . Hubert Ackley  --  no . He is a perfect little gentleman . " " Yes , " the principal said , " Hubert Ackley does come from a well-to-do family . But if Miss Hicks has asked him to stay in after school , then in it is . He is a perfect little gentleman , no doubt . His father was , I remember . Perfect  --  perfect . But Miss Hicks is the teacher of the ancient history class and she has never been known to punish anyone who has not deserved to be punished . Hubert Ackley will have to be satisfied to run the race some other time . " The matter was surely closed now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office . He did not go to the athletic field , however . He went to the ancienthistory classroom instead . There he found Homer and Hubert and Miss Hicks . He bowed to the old teacher and smiled . " Miss Hicks , " he said , " I have spoken to Mr. Ek about this matter . " The implication of his remark was that he had been given authorization to come and liberate Hubert Ackley III . Homer Macauley , however , leaped to his feet as if it were he who was to be liberated . " Not you , " the coach said with a tone of contempt . He turned to the other boy and said , " Mr. Ackley . " " What do you mean ? " the ancient-history teacher said. 68The Two-Twenty Low Hurdle Race " Mr. Ackley , " the coach said , " is to get into his track suit immediately and run the two-twenty low hurdles . We 're waiting for him . " " Oh yeah ? " Homer said . He was overflowing with righteous indignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about me  --  Mr. Macauley ? " There was no reply from the coach , who walked out of the room followed by a somewhat troubled and confused young man  --  Hubert Ackley III . " Did you see that , Miss Hicks ? " Homer Macauley shouted . " Is that special privilege or not ? " The ancient-history teacher was so upset by what had happened that she could barely speak . " Mr. Byfield , " she whispered softly , " is fitted to teach athletics only to jackasses like himself . " She paused to observe the unworthiness of her remark . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " But the man is not only ignorant , he is a liar ! " It was delightful to see Miss Hicks with so much natural and uncontrollable bitterness . It made Homer feel that she was just about the best teacher ever . " I never did like him , " Homer said . " It sure is good to know that you do n't like him either . " " I have taught ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hicks said . " I have been the school mother of hundreds of Ithaca boys and girls . I taught your brother Marcus and your sister Bess , and if you have younger brothers or sisters at home I shall some day teach them too . " 69The Human Comedy " Just a brother , Miss Hicks , " Homer said . " His name is Ulysses . How was Marcus in school ? " " Marcus and Bess , " Miss Hicks said , " were both good  --  honest and civilized . Yes , " she said , " civilized , " and she emphasized the word very carefully . " The behavior of ancient peoples had made them civilized from birth . Like yourself , Marcus sometimesspoke out of turn , but he was never a liar . Now these inferior human beings , these Byfields of the world who were never anything but fools  --  they think of me as an old woman . He came here and deliberately lied to me  --  just as he had lied to me time and again when he sat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except to toady shamelesslyto those he feels are superior . " " Yeah ? " Homer said , urging the ancient-history teacher to go on with her criticism . " I have seen better men pushed around by his kind , " she said . " The kind who go through life lying and cheating and crowding out men who are above such behavior . The two-twenty low hurdles ! Low indeed ! " The ancient-history teacher was terribly hurt . She blew her nose and wiped her eyes . " Ah , do n't feel bad , Miss Hicks , " Homer said . " I 'll stay in . You can punish me for talking out of turn . I guess I 've got it coming , but from now on I 'm going to try to be good . I never did know that teachers are human beings like anybody else  --  and better , too ! It 's all right , Miss Hicks . You can punishme.

I still do not believe I am mistaken about Hubert Ackley . It was Mr. Byfield who made him disobey me . I was going to send both of you to the field after a moment , anyway . You were not kept in for punishment , but for education . I watch the growth of spirit in the children who come to my class , and I am made happy by every fresh evidence of that growth . You apologized to Hubert Ackley , and even though it embarrassed him to do so , because your apology made him unworthy , he graciously accepted your apology . I kept you in after school because I wanted to talk to both of you  --  one of you from a good wellto-dofamily , the other from a good poor family . Getting along in this world will be even more difficult for him than for you . I wanted you to know one another a little better . It is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I guess I like Hubert , " Homer said , " only he seems to think he is better than the other boys . " " Yes , I know , " the ancient-history teacher said . " I know how you feel , but every man in the world is better than someone else , and not as good as someoneelse . Joe Terranova is brighter than Hubert , but Hubert is just as honest in his own way . In a democratic state every man is the equal of every7 ' The Human Comedyother man up to the point of exertion , and after that every man is free to exert himself to do good or not , to grow nobly or foolishly , as he wishes . I am eager for my boys and girls to exert themselves to do good and to grow nobly . What my children appear to be on the surface is no matter to me . I am fooled neither by gracious manners nor by bad manners . I am interested in what is truly beneath each kind of manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Catholic or Protestant or Jew , white or black or yellow , brilliant or slow , genius or simpleminded , is no matter to me , if there is humanity in him  --  if he has a heart  --  if he loves truth and honor  --  if he respects his inferiors and loves his superiors . If the children of my classroom are human , I do not want them to be alike in their manner of being human . If they are not corrupt , it does not matter to me how they differ from one another . I want each of my children to be himself . I do n't want you , Homer , to be like somebody else just to please me or to make my work easier . I would soon be weary of a classroom full of perfect little ladies and gentlemen . I want my children to be people  --  each one separate  --  each one special  --  each one a pleasant and exciting variation of all the others .

That is what it means to be civilized  --  that is what we are to learn from a study of ancient history . " The teacher stopped now a moment and looked at the boy who , for some reason that even he could not understand , was on the verge of tears . " I 'm glad I 've spoken to you , " she said , " rather than to anyone else I know . When you leave this school  --  long after you have forgotten me  --  I shall be watching for you in the world , and I shall never be startled by the good things I know you shall do .

" The teacher sighed and said wearily , " Run along to the field , Homer Macauley . I shall be watching . " The second son of the Macauley family of Santa Clara Avenue in Ithaca , California , turned and walked out of the room . On the athletic field Hubert Ackley and the three boys who had already raced with him that day were73The Human Comedytaking their places in the lanes for the two-twenty low hurdle race . Homer reached the fifth lane just as the man with the pistol lifted his arm to start the race . Homer went to his mark with the others . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he believed that nothing in the world would be able to keep him from winning this race  --  the wrong kind of shoes , the wrong kind of clothes for running , no practice , or anything else . He would just naturally win the race . Hubert Ackley , in the lane next to Homer 's lane , turned to him and said , " You ca n't run this race  --  like that . " " No ? " Homer said . " Wait and see . " Mr. Byfield , sitting in the grandstand , turned to the man next to him and said , " Who 's that starting in the outside lane without track clothes ? " Then he remembered who it was . He decided to stop the race so that he could remove the fifth runner , but it was too late . The gun had been fired and the runners were running . Homer and Hubert took the first hurdle a little ahead of the others , each of them clearing nicely . Homer moved a little forward ahead of Hubert on the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fifth , sixth , seventh and eighth hurdles . But close behind him was Hubert Ackley . The two boys exchanged words as they ran . On the first hurdle Hubert shouted , " Where did you learn to run like that ? " The Two-Twenty Low Hurdle Race " Nowhere , " Homer said . " I 'm learning now . " On the second hurdle , Hubert said , " What 's the hurry ? You 're going too fast . " " I 'm going to win the race , " Homer said . On the third hurdle Ackley said , " Who said so ? " And on the fourth hurdle Homer said , " I said so . " On the fifth hurdle Hubert said , " Slow down . This is a long race . You 'll get tired . " And then suddenly he shouted , " Oh  --  oh , look out ! Here comes Byfield ! " Homer reached the ninth hurdle exactly when the coach of Ithaca High School reached it ,  --  coming in the opposite direction . Nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the athletic coach and the man and the boy fell to the ground . Hubert Ackley stopped running and turned to the other runners . " Stay where you are , " he shouted . " Let him get up . He 's running a good race , and he 's had interference . " Homer got to his feet quickly and went on running . The instant he started , the others started running also . Everyone in the grandstand , even Helen Eliot , was amazed at what was happening in the race . Now the ancient-history teacher , Miss Hicks , was at the finish line of the race . She was cheering , but she was cheering for each of the boys . " Come on , Homer ! " she said . " Come on , Hubert ! Hurry , Sam !  --  George !  --  Henry ! " At the next to the last hurdle Hubert AckleyThe Human Comedycaught up with Homer Macauley . " Sorry , " he said , " I 've got to do it . " " Go ahead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hubert Ackley ran a little in front of Homer and there was no longer far to go . Homer did n't clear the last hurdle , but he almost caught up with the front runner . The finish of the race was so close no one could tell whether Hubert Ackley won or whether Homer Macauley won . Sam , George and Henry came in soon after , and Miss Hicks , the ancient-historyteacher , brought them all together . " You ran beautifully , " she said , " every one of you ! " " I 'm sorry , " Hubert Ackley said , " Miss Hicks . I should have stayed in , with Homer . " " It 's all right now , " Miss Hicks said , " and it was good of you to wait for Homer to get up when he was interfered with . " Furious and bitter and a little shocked by the fall he had taken , the coach of Ithaca High School came running toward the group which Miss Hicks had gathered around her . " Macauley ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remainder of this semester , " he said , " for what you have just done , you are deprived of the privilege of taking part in any school sport activities . " The coach reached the group and stood glaringat Homer Macauley . The ancient-history teacher turned to him. 76The Two-Twenty Low Hurdle Race " Mr. Byfield , " she said , " why are you punishing Homer Macauley ? " " Excuse me , Miss Hicks , " the coach said . " I will make my decisions without any assistance from the ancient history department . " He turned to Homer and said , " Do you understand ? " " Yes , sir , " Homer said . " Now go to my office and stay there until I tell you to go , " Byfield said . " Your office ? " Homer said . " But I 've got to go  --  " He suddenly remembered that he had to be at work at four o'clock . " What time is it ? " he said . Hubert Ackley looked at his wrist watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Go to my office ! " Byfield shouted . " But you do n't understand , Mr. Byfield , " Homer said . " I 've got some place to go . I 'll be late . " Joe Terranova came into the group . " Why should he stay after school ? " Joe said . " He did n't do anything wrong . " The coach had already suffered too much . " You keep your dirty little wop mouth shut ! " he shouted at Joe . Then he pushed the boy , who went sprawling . But before he had touched the ground , Joe Terranova shouted : " w-o-P ? " Homer tackled Mr. Byfield as if they were on a football field , at the same time saying , " You ca n't call a friend of mine names . " By the time Homer and Byfield were on the ground again , Joe Terranova was on his feet . In77The Human Comedya fury he leaped on Byfield so that the man was sprawled all over the place . The principal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bewildered . " Gentlemen ! " he said . " Boys , boys ! " He dragged Joe Terranova off the athletic coach , who did not get to his feet . " Mr. Byfield , " the principal of the school said , " what is the meaning of this unusual behavior ? " Speechless , Byfield pointed to Miss Hicks . Miss Hicks stood above the man . " I 've told you many times , Mr. Byfield , not to push people around , " she said . " They do n't like it . " She turned to the principal of the school . " Mr. Byfield , " she said , " owes Joe Terranova an apology . " " Is that so ? Is that so , Mr. Byfield ? " Mr. Ek said . " Joe 's people are from Italy , " Miss Hicks said . " They are not , however , to be referred to as wops . " Joe Terranova said , " He does n't need to apologize to me . If he calls me names , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me up , I 'll get my brothers . " " Joseph ! " Miss Hicks said . " You must allow Mr. Byfield to apologize . He is not apologizing to you or to your people . He is apologizing to our own country . You must give him the privilege of once again trying to be an American . " " Yes , that 's so , " the principal of the school said . " This is America , and the only foreigners here are those who forget that this is America . " He turned78The Two-Twenty Low Hurdle Raceto the man who was still sprawled on the ground . " Mr. Byfield , " he commanded . The athletic coach of Ithaca High School got to his feet . To no one in particular he said , " I apologize , " and hurried away . Joe Terranova and Homer Macauley went off together . Joe walked well , but Homer limped . He had hurt his left leg when Byfield had tried to stop him . Miss Hicks and Mr. Ek turned to the thirty or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many types and many nationalities . " All right , now , " Miss Hicks said . " Go along home to your families , " and as the children were all a little bewildered , she added , " Brighten up , brighten up  --  do n't be so upset . This is nothing . " " Yes , " the principal of the school said , " brighten up . The War is n't going to last forever . " The children broke up into groups and walked away . CHAPTER 13THE TRAP , MY GOD , THETRAP ! When Homer Macauley swung onto his bicycle after the track meet to get to work as soon as possible , a man named Big Chris walked into Covington'sSporting Goods Store on Tulare Street . He was a huge man , tall , lean and hard , with a great blond beard . He had just come down from the hills around Piedra to see about some new grub and shells and traps . Mr. Covington , the founder and proprietor of the store , began immediately to demonstrate to Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just been invented by a man out in Friant. 8oThe Trap , My God , the Trap ! The trap was enormous and complicated . It was made of steel , lemonwood , springs and ropes . Its principle seemed to be to take the animal , swing it up and around , and hold it off its feet until the trapper arrived . " This is brand new , " Mr. Covington said , " invented by a man named Safferty out in Friant . He 's applied for a patent and so far he 's made only two of them , one a model , which he sent to the patent office , and this one , which he sent to me , to sell . The trap is for any kind of animal that walks . Mr. Saffertycalls it The LIFT-THEM-OFF-THEIR-FEET , SWINGTHEM-AROUND , AND-HOLD-THEM SAFFERTY ALL-ANIMALTRAP . ' He 's asking twenty dollars for it . Of course the trap has n't been tested , but as you can see for yourself , it is strong and could very likely lift , swing and hold a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris listened to the proprietor of the sportinggoods store as a child listens , and behind him Ulysses Macauley listened with the same fascination , ducking in between the two men for a better view of the trap . Mr. Covington was under the impression that Ulysses belonged to Big Chris and Big Chris was under the impression that Ulysses belonged to Mr. Covington so that between the two of them they had no reason to account for the small boy 's presence . As for Ulysses himself , he was under the impression that he belonged wherever there was something interesting to see. 81The Human Comedy The Trap , My God , the Trap ! , " The remarkable thing about this trap , " Mr. Covington said , " is that it will not hurt the animal , leaving the fur whole and undamaged . The trap is guaranteed by Mr. Safferty himself for a period of eleven years . This includes all parts  --  the pliancy of the wood , which is lemonwood , the endurance of the springs , the steel , the ropes , and all other parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believesthis is the most effective and humane trap in the world . A man close to seventy , he lives quietly in Friant , reading books and inventing things . He has invented , all told , thirty-seven separate and distinctitems of practical usefulness . " Mr. Covington stopped his work with the trap . " Now , " he said , " I believe the trap is set . " Ulysses , crowding in to watch , moved too far : the trap closed on him gently but swiftly , lifted him off his feet , turned him around and held him three feet off the floor , straight out , horizontally , clamped in . No sound came from the boy , even though he was a little bewildered . Big Chris , however , did not take the event so lightly . " Careful there ! " he shouted to Covington . " I do n't want your son to be hurt . " " My son ? " Covington said . " I thought he was your son . I never saw the boy before in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did ? " Big Chris said . " I did n't notice . Well , now , hurry ! Get him out of the trap  --  get him out ! " " Yes , sir , " Covington said . " Now let me see . " 82Big Chris was worried and confused . " What 's your name , boy ? " he said . " Ulysses , " the boy in the trap said . " I ly name is Big Chris , " the man from the hills said . " Now you just hold tight there , Ulysses , and the man here will get you right out and set you down on your feet . " Big Chris turned to Mr. Covington . " Well , come on now , " he said , " get the boy out . Get him out ! " Mr. Covington , however , was just as confused as Big Chris . " I 'm not sure I remember how Mr. Saffertyexplained that part of the trap , " he said . " Mr. Safferty did n't demonstrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have anything to demonstrate it on . Mr. Safferty only explained it . I believe this is supposed to move out  --  no , it seems to be im-movable . " Now Big Chris and Mr. Covington went to work on the trap together , Big Chris holding Ulysses so that if the trap opened suddenly Ulysses would n't fall on his face , and the other man fooling around with the various parts of the trap to see if anything would give way . " Well , hurry now , " Big Chris said . " Let 's not keep the boy in the air all day . You 're not hurt , are you , Ulysses ? " " No , sir , " Ulysses said . " Well , you just hold tight , " Big Chris said . " We 'll get you out of this . " He looked at the boy and then said , " What made you crowd in there ? " 83The Human Comedy " Watching , " Ulysses said . " Yes , it is a fascinating sort of contraption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now the man here will get you right out and I wo n't let you fall . How old are you ? " " Four , " Ulysses said . " Four , " Big Chris said . " Well , I 'm fifty years older than you . Now the man here will get you right out , wo n't you ? " And Big Chris turned to Mr. Covington . " What 's your name ? " he said . " Walter Covington , " Mr. Covington said . " I own this store . " " Well , that 's fine , " Big Chris said . " Now , Walter , get the boy out of the trap . Move that piece of wood there . I 'm holding him . Do n't you worry , Ulysses . What 's your father 's name ? " " Matthew , " Ulysses said . " Well , he 's a lucky man to have a boy like you around , " Big Chris said . " A fellow with his eyes open . I 'd give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I never met the right woman . I met a girl in Oklahoma thirty years ago but she went off with another fellow . Have you got it there , Walter ? " " Not yet , " Mr. Covington said . " But I 'll get it . I believe this is supposed to  --  no . Mr. Safferty explainedhow to get the animal out of the trap , but it seems I just ca n't get the hang of it . Maybe the principle changes when it 's a small boy instead of an animal . " Two men , a woman with a small girl , and two boys of nine or ten came into the store to watch . The Trap , My God , the Trap ! " What 's the matter ? " one of the boys said . " We 've got a boy caught in a trap here , " Mr. Covingtonsaid . " A boy named Ulysses . " " How 'd he get in ? " one of the men said . " Shall I call a doctor ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris said . " The boy 's all right . He 's just off his feet , that 's all .

" " Well , " the lady said , " it 's a shame the way little boys are made to suffer by all sorts of ridiculous mechanical devices . " " The boy 's all right , lady , " Big Chris said . " He is n't suffering . " " Well , " the lady said , " if he were my boy , I 'd have the police on you in two minutes . " She turned away in a huff , dragging her little daughter along with her . " I want to see , I want to see ! " the little girl cried . " Everybody gets to see but me ! " The woman turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the store . " Now do n't you worry , Ulysses , " Big Chris said . " We 'll get you out of this in no time at all . " Mr. Covington , however , gave up . " Maybe I 'd better telephone Mr. Safferty , " he said . " I ca n't get the boy out . " 84 I 85The Human Comedy " Got to stay here ? " Ulysses said . " No , you do n't , boy , " Big Chris said . " No , you do n't . We 'll get you out . " A boy with a dozen afternoon papers under his arm came into the store , crowded into the scene , looked at Ulysses , looked at the people , looked at Ulysses again , and then spoke . " Hello , Ulysses , " he said . " What are you doing ? " " Hello , Auggie , " Ulysses said . " Caught . " " What for ? " Auggie said . " Got caught , " Ulysses said . The newsboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way . He looked around , panic-stricken and paralyzed , and after a moment of confusion bolted for the street . He ran straight to the telegraph office . Homer was n't there , so he ran into the street again , running one way and then the other , bumping into people and shouting the day 's headline all at the same time . A woman who had been bumped said to herself , " Crazy !  --  Crazy from trying to sell papers ! " Auggie ran a full block , got out into the middle of the street to look around in four directions for Homer . I t was a miracle that Homer appeared around a corner on his bicycle , but he did . Auggie ran toward Homer , shouting at him with all his might . " Homer ! You 've got to come right away ! Homer , you 've got to  --  " The Trap , My God , the Trap ! Homer got off his bicycle . " What 's the matter , Auggie ? " he said . " Homer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homer was right beside him . " You 've got to come with me , Homer ! " He took Homer by the arm . " But what 's the matter ? " Homer said . " Over at Covington 's , " Auggie said . " Hurry  --  you 've got to come ! " " Ah , " Homer said , " you want to show me some fishing tackle or a rifle or something in the window . I ca n't go around looking at things any more , Auggie . I 'm working now . I 've got to go to work . " Homer got back on his wheel and began to ride away , but Auggie took hold of the bike seat and trotted beside him , pushing the bike toward Covington 's . " Homer , " he shouted , " you 've got to come with me ! He 's caught  --  he ca n't get out ! " " What are you talking about ? " Homer said . Now they were across the street from Covington 's . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to be a little frightened . Auggie pointed at the people . The two boys pushed through the crowd into the store , to the trap . There in the trap was Homer 's brother Ulysses , and around the trap were Big Chris , Mr. Covington , and a number of strange men and women and boys . " Ulysses ! " Homer shouted . " Hello , Homer , " Ulysses said . The Human ComedyHomer turned to the people . " What 's my brother doing in that thing ? " he said . " He got caught , " Mr. Covington said . " What are all these people doing around here ? " Homer said . " Go on , go on home , " he said to the people . " Ca n't a small boy get caught in a trap without the whole world hanging around ? " " Yes , " Mr. Covington said , " I 'll have to ask you people to go who are not customers . " Mr. Covington studied the people . " Mr. Wallace , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , and you , Mr. Sickert . George . Mr. Spindle . Shorty . " " I trade here , " a man said . " I bought fish hooks here not more than a week ago . " " Yes , " Mr. Covington said , " fish hooks . The rest of you will have to go . " Only two people moved away a little . " Do n't worry , Ulysses , " Homer said . " Everything'sgoing to be all right now . It 's a good thing Auggie found me . Auggie , run over to the telegraph office and tell Mr. Spangler my brother Ulysses is caught in a trap at Covington 's and I 'm trying to get him out . I 'm late already but tell him I 'll be over as soon as I can get Ulysses out of the trap . Hurry now . " Auggie turned and ran . He bumped into a policemanwho was coming into the store and almost knocked the man down . " What 's all the commotion about ? " the policeman said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 've got a small boy caught in a trap here , " Mr. Covington said . " Ca n't get him out . " " Let me look into this , " the policeman said .

You 've got better things to do than stand around and watch a small boy in a trap . " The policeman moved the people out of the store and locked the front door . He turned to Mr. Covington and Big Chris . " Now let 's get this boy out of this thing and send him home , " he said . " Yes , " Mr. Covington said , " and the sooner the better . You 've got my shop closed at four-thirty in the afternoon . " " Well , how does this thing work ? " Homer said .

That 's all . " " It 's not a torture machine , " Mr. Covington said . " It 's the most improved animal trap on the market . It holds the animal aloft without damage to fur or body . No squeezing , cutting or crushing . It operates on the principle of dislocating the animal from its base and thereby rendering it powerless . Besides , Mr. Safferty may not be at home .

" Marcus is in the Army , " Homer said . " Do you want an ice cream cone or anything like that ? " " No , " Ulysses said , " just Marcus . " " Well , Marcus is in the Army , " Homer said . He turned to Covington . " Get my brother out of this thing and hurry up about it , too ! " he said . " Wait a minute , " Big Chris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't let him fall !

Ulysses twisted around to watch the man . At last Big Chris destroyed the trap . Ulysses was free . Holding him so that he would not fall on his face , Homer set his little brother on his feet . The crowd in front of the store cheered , but not effectively , as they were unorganized and had no leader . Ulysses tried out his legs . As everything seemed to be all right now , Homer put his arms around his brother . Ulysses looked at Big Chris . The big man was almostexhausted . " Somebody 's got to pay for that trap , " Mr. Covingtonsaid . " It 's ruined . Somebody 's got to pay for it . " Without a word , Big Chris brought some currencyout of his pocket , counted out twenty dollars of it and tossed it onto the counter .

There 's no telling what it 's liable to do . " Mr. Covington went out into the street to speak to the people there . " The store is open for business again , " he said . " Covington 's opens at eight every morning , closes at seven every night , except Saturdayswhen we are open till ten . Closed all day Sunday . Everything in the sporting line . Fishing tackle , guns , ammunition , and athletic goods . We 're open for business , ladies and gentlemen . Come right in . " The people slowly walked away .

" The three boys left the store and walked to the telegraph office . Mr. Spangler was leaning on the counter , looking out at the street . Mr. Grogan was sending a telegram . Homer was limping worse than ever now from his collision with Mr. Byfield in the two-twenty low hurdle race . He stopped to speak to the manager of the telegraph office .

" A few telegrams have piled up that you 've got to deliver , but it 's all right . So that 's your brother  --  Ulysses ? " Ulysses was standing behind the telegraph operator , watching him work . In front of the telegraph operator , across the table , Auggie stood , listening to the telegraph box . " A few calls have come in , too , " Spangler said . " I took a couple of the near ones myself . The other two are on the call sheet . Take the calls first , then deliver the telegrams . " 94 0 95The Trap , My God , the Trap !

CHAPTER 14 DIANAUlysses moved closer to Mr. Grogan while Auggielistened to the clatter of the telegraph box . " What 's that for ? " Auggie said to Mr. Spangler , indicating the box . " Mr. Grogan 's sending a telegram , " Spangler said . " Where 's he sending it to ? " Auggie said . " New York , " Spangler said . " All the way to New York ? " Auggie said . " How does it go ? " " It goes by wire , " Spangler said . " Wires on telegraph poles ? " Auggie said . " Tele-Dianagraph poles from here to New York ? All the way from Ithaca to New York ?

" Everybody I know is right here in Ithaca , " Auggie said . A green light went on , on the repeaterrack . " What 's that green light for ? " Auggie said . " It 's a signal to us that the line is clear , " Spanglersaid . " What line ? " Auggie said . " The line to San Francisco , " Spangler said . " Oh , " Auggie said .

You can enlist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a rule , " Spangler said . " What have they got all them rules for all the time ? " Auggie said .

" So they wo n't get tired , " Spangler said . " So they can play . That rule is for the protection of children . " " Protection from what ? " Auggie said . " Well , " Spangler said , " protection from hard work , I guess . Protection from bosses who make kids do too much work for the money they 're paid . " " Well , what if the kid does n't want to be protected ? " Auggie said . " What if he wants to work ? " " They protect him anyway , " Spangler said . " How old do you have to be not to be a child any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to be to be able to protect yourself , or to do any kind of work you want to do ?

He 's only fourteen but he 's strong and he 's intel-ligent . " " What do you mean  --  intelligent ? " Auggie said . " Do you have to be intelligent to be a messenger ? " " No , " Spangler said , " but it helps . It helps to be intelligent no matter what you are . " " Well , " Auggie said , " how can you tell if a man 's intelligent ? " Spangler looked at the newsboy and smiled . " By talking to him a few minutes , " he said . " What are you putting those papers in there for ? " Auggie said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " We file them in here , city by city , for our records and our bookkeeping . Now this telegramis to San Francisco , so I put it in here . All these telegrams in here are to San Francisco .

" Spangler stopped working to look at the boy . " Yes , I will , Auggie , " he said , " but not just yet . Nine is not quite old enough . Thirteen or fourteen  --  yes . " " Twelve maybe ? " Auggie said . " Maybe , " Spangler said . " What do you want to be a messenger for ? " " Learn things , " Auggie said . " Read telegrams . Find out about things . " He paused a moment .

" The Human ComedyThe manager of the telegraph office and the newsboylooked at each other , each of them very earnest and very serious . " August Gottlieb , " Spangler said , " I give you my word . When the time comes  --  " Spangler stopped speaking to behold a young woman named Diana Steed galloping into the office . In front of the office in the street was the automobilewhich had brought her . At the wheel of the automobile sat a chauffeur in uniform . In a special , somewhat artificial yet attractive voice , she cried out to Spangler , " Oh , there you are , darling ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , threw her arms around him , and kissed him in a way that was so incredible it might have been real , or a little better than real . " Wait a minute ! " Spangler said . He held her back , put the wire basket he was holding on the desk , and turned to her . The young woman came for him again but he warded her off . " Wait a minute , " he said . " This is August Gottlieb ! " " How do you do , little boy ? " the young woman said . " August , " Spangler said , " this is Miss Steed . " " Hello , " Auggie said . And then , not knowing what else to say , he said , " Paper , lady ? " " Why , yes , of course , " Diana said . " How much is it ? " " Five cents , " Auggie said . " Home edition . Race results , stock market closings , and the latest news of the War . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a nickel . Thank you very much . " Auggie took the nickel and gave Miss Steed a paper which he first folded in a very efficient and businesslike way , whacking the full paper on his knee , folding it in half , whacking the half paper on his knee , folding that in half , and then , turning the result around neatly , somewhat like a magician doing an important trick , he handed it to her . " Thank you , ma'am , " he said . " Wednesdays I sell The Saturday Evening Post and Liberty . Fridays , Collier 's . I work the whole town . " " Well , " Diana said , " I hope you make a lot of money , little boy . " " I average about forty cents a day , papers and magazines both , " Auggie said . " When the County Fair opens I sell soda pop . " " Well , you do keep busy , do n't you ? " Diana said in her wonderful cheerful voice . " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can figure people out pretty good . " It appeared that Auggie had figured Miss Steed out and was pleased with the results . " Yes , you do , " she said , " I 'm sure you do . " She turned to Spangler . " I waited for your call , darling , " she said . " You did say you would call at five , didn'tyou ? " " Oh , yeah , " Spangler said . " I forgot . I was talking to Auggie here . He wants to be a messenger andzozThe Human Comedy I DianaI 've just told him when the time comes he 's going to have a job . " " Well , thanks , Mr. Spangler , " Auggie said . He moved to go . " I 'll be seeing you , " he said . " Good-by , ma'am . " He turned to the little boy . " Good-by , Ulysses , " he said . " Ulysses ! " Diana said to Spangler . " My , what a refreshing name ! Ulysses ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . You will be out for dinner , wo n't you ? You must , you know . " Spangler began to speak but the young woman stopped him . " No , " she said , " you promised ! Yes , you did ! Mother and Father are dying to meet you ! Seven o'clock sharp ! " " Now wait a minute , " Spangler said . " Wait a minute . " " Darling , " Diana said , " you ca n't disappoint me again , can you ? " " Nothing in the world is ever going to disappoint you , " Spangler said , " so take it easy . Seven o'clock sharp ? What do you mean  --  sharp ? What do you want me to come to dinner for ? " " Because I love you , darling , " the young woman said very patiently , as if Spangler were a child . " I love you , love you , love you , do you hear ? " she said , laughing cheerfully . " Now take it easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Every time you come out with that kind of talk I  --  " 1o2 " But I do love you , darling , " the young woman said earnestly . Spangler sighed . " I 've been out to dinner twice in my life , " he said . " I was bored both times . " " You 'll like Mother and Father , " Diana said . " We 're not dressing  --  just evening clothes . " " What do you mean  --  evening clothes ? " Spangler said . " I 'm wearing the clothes I wear day and eveningboth . " " Seven o'clock , " Diana said . She noticed the hardboiledegg on Spangler 's desk . " Oh , darling , " she said , " what a clever paper weight ! What is it ? " " It 's an egg , " Spangler said . " A real egg . I keep it for luck . " " How sweet ! " Diana said . " Well , darling , I 've got to run . " She moved toward him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she left the office . Mr. Grogan finished typing a telegram . Spanglerled Ulysses over to the old man . " Willie , " he said , " I 'm going over to Corbett 's for a drink . This is Ulysses Macauley , Homer 's little brother . He 's had an experience of some sort . Got caught in some kind of trap . Ulysses , this is Mr. Willie Gro-gan . " " Oh , we 're old friends , " Mr. Grogan said . " He 's been watching me work . " Ulysses nodded . " One drink and I 'll be right back , " Spangler said. 103CHAPTER 15THE GIRL ON THE CORNERSpangler turned to go , but he was stopped by the working of the call box  --  by the message which simultaneously rang out and printed itself upon the ticker tape . He went to the instrument on the deliverydesk and studied the marks on the tape . " That 's a call from Ithaca Wine , " he said to Grogan  --  " awayout in the sticks . If Homer comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening call from Sunripe Raisin . He 's beat Western Union there twice in two tries . If he can make it again todaywe may have a pretty good month of business after all . How many did we get yesterday ? " The Girl on the Corner " Sixty-seven , " Grogan said . " Sixty-seven telegrams out of sixty-eight , " Spanglersaid . " First boy there gets all the telegrams but one . Second boy gets one . Well , I 'll go get that drink . " But now another call began to come in : Dot dot dash dot dot dot . When the manager of the telegraph office had heard only the first two dots , he knew the call was from Sunripe Raisin , and as Homer was not in the office to take the call , he shouted to Grogan , " I 'll take the call . I 'll get there first myself . " By the time the call was repeated three times , Spangler was in the middle of the next block , moving through the people like an open field runner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thirty yards away , stood a shy , lonely-looking girl of eighteenor nineteen  --  tired , sweet , hushed , and wonderful . She was waiting for a bus to take her home , after work . Even though he was running , it was impossible for Spangler not to notice the girl 's loneliness  --  which seemed to him , even though he was in a hurry , like the loneliness of all things . Not clowning , without any premeditation , swiftly and easily , he reached the girl , paused a moment , and kissed her on the cheek . Before he moved on , he told the girl the only thing it was possible to say to her : " You are the loveliest woman in the world ! " He ran on . When he was going up the steps ofThe Human Comedythe Sunripe Raisin Association three at a time , the Western Union messenger , off to a slow start because the delivery clerk did not know the calls by heart as Spangler did , was just getting off his bicycle in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Western Union messenger had only begun to wait for the elevator . As if he were still a messenger , Spangler announcedhimself to the old woman at the desk of Sunripe Raisin . " Postal Telegraph ! " he said . " Tom ! " the old woman said , pleased and surprised . " Do n't tell me you 're a messenger now , too . " " Once a messenger , always a messenger , " Spangler said , not at all embarrassed by the meaninglessness of the remark . He smiled at the old woman and then said , " But most of all I came to see you , Mrs. Brockington . " The Western Union messenger came into the office . " Western Union , " he said . " Well , Harry , " Mrs. Brockington said , " you 've been beaten again . " She handed the messenger one telegram . " Better luck next time , " she said . The Western Union boy , a little confused and embarrassed because he had been beaten again , this time not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Telegraph office , took the one telegram and said , " Thanks just the same , Mrs. Brockington , " and left the office . The old woman handed Spangler a whole bundle of telegrams . " Here you are , Tom , " she said , " one106The Girl on the Cornerhundred and twenty-nine night letters  --  all over the country  --  all paid . " " One hundred and twenty-nine ? " Spangler said . " That 's going to give me a good month of business after all . " He leaned over the railing and kissed the old woman . " Now , Tom ! " Mrs. Brockington said . " No , " Spangler said , " you must n't be unkind to me . I 've been wanting to kiss you ever since I first came in here and saw you  --  remember ? Twenty years  --  and you 've become more beautiful every year . " " Now , Tom , " the old woman said , " do n't you be teasing an old woman . " " Old ? " Spangler said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tom , " Mrs. Brockington said , " and so are all your messengers  --  but where is the new one ? " " Homer ? " Spangler said . " You mean Homer Macauley ? You 'll be seeing him every day  --  first , too . We got slowed down this afternoon on account of an accident that happened to his little brother , a boy named Ulysses . Got caught in some kind of a trap at Covington 's . Homer had to go and get him out . But you 'll be seeing him from now on . " He stopped and smiled at the old woman . " Good night , Emily , " he said . " How sweet of you to remember my name , " the old woman said . In the street he felt very good  --  about everything107The Human Comedyabout Horner getting Ulysses out of the trap , about Grogan being able to do his work even though he had long since passed the pension age , about Ulysses standing around being fascinated by everything in the telegraph office , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about Diana Steed , even . But most of all he felt happy about the girl who had been waiting for the bus on the street corner . When he reached the place where the girl had stood , he paused a moment . He said to himself , " It was right here that she was standing . I 'll never see her again most likely , but even if I do , I 'll never see her again as she was when I saw her this afternoon . " He moved on down the street , whistling to himself . When he was across the street from Corbett 's , he heard pianola music  --  the old waltz called All That I Want Is You . He moved to the swinging doors of the saloon , listened a moment , then went on in . Corbett himself was at the bar and immediatelywent to work , getting Spangler his regular drink , Scotch and plain water . " Hello , Ralph , " Spangler said . " How 's it going ? " He glanced over at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad , not good , " Corbett said . " Soldiers with a lot of time to kill and not very much money . I buy them three to their one , and when they 're broke and ready to go I give them back their money . Why not ? " " Can you afford to do that ? " Spangler said. 108The Girl on the Corner " No , " Corbett said , " but what 's the difference ? After the War maybe I 'll get some of it back . I just ca n't be a bartender . I 'm Young Corbett . " He stopped a moment to remember something that was troubling him . " Last night , Tom , " he said , " I 'm tending bar , trying to get along , and a wise guy calls out to me , Hey , screwball ! Get me another drink . ' He was n't a soldier . He was somebody from Ithaca . Well , I look around  --  nobody else behind the bar  --  just me . Screwball ? Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't talking to myself , screwball , ' the guy says . Well , what am I going to do ? I ca n't hit the guy because I 've been in the ring . I went over to him and took him  --  like this . " Corbett took Spangler by the coat lapel with one hand , and with the other , lifted high , palm open , he waited a furious moment . Then he said what he had said the night before to the bad drinker : " You 're talking to Young Corbett . If I slap you , you 'll probably fall down and die , and I do n't want anybody to die in my place . Now get out of here and do n't come back . Do n't ever step into this joint again as long as you live . And when you go out , be glad you 're alive . " Corbett let go of Spangler 's coat . He was trembling with rage . " My hands were shaking all night after that , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that happened . It happens almost every night . And every time it happens I tell myself , No more ! I 've got to close the place . Got to109The Human Comedyget away . ' I 'm getting scared . Some night I 'm afraid I 'm going to lose my head and murder somebody . Running a bar is n't an easy thing . I 've got too good a heart to be a bartender . " The manager of the telegraph office and the formerprize fighter talked along for another five minutesand then Spangler went back to the office . As he left the saloon , the soldiers had the player piano going strong . Now the song was White Blossom . The soldiers watched the words as they moved down the roll and tried to sing with the piano music . Spangler listened a moment . Their singing was n't particularly good , but the feeling with which they sang was not bad at all . I 'LL TAKE YOU HOME AGAINThomas Spangler , manager of the Postal Telegraphoffice of Ithaca , California , walked into his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Homer and Ulysses  --  the messenger foldingtelegrams and putting them in envelopes , the younger brother watching with quiet admiration . The messenger turned to his boss . " Did you get Sunripe Raisin , Mr. Spangler ? " he said . " Yes , I did , " Spangler said . " One hundred and twenty-nine telegrams . " He showed the telegrams to the messenger . IIIThe Human Comedy " One hundred and twenty-nine ! " Homer said . " How did you get there first ? " " I ran , " Spangler said . " You beat Western Union to Sunripe Raisin running ? " Homer said . " Sure , " Spangler said . " Nothing to it . I even stopped on the way  --  to pay tribute to beauty and innocence . " Homer did n't understand , but Spanglerwent right on . " No , no , I wo n't explain it , " Spangler said . " Take Ulysses home . " " Yes , sir , " Homer said . " We 've got a call from Guggenheim 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ulysses home , then go to Guggenheim 's and from there I 'll go to Ithaca Wine , then Foley 's , and then I 'll come right back . I 'll be back in no time at all . " The messenger left the office and carefully set his brother on the handlebars of his bicycle while Spanglerwatched . The older brother swung onto the bike and began to pedal down the street . When they were out of the town itself , Ulysses twisted around to look at his brother . For the first time that day his face broke out with the Macauley smile . " Homer ? " he said . " What do you want ? " I-Iomer said . " I can sing , " Ulysses said . " That 's good , " Homer said . Ulysses began to sing . " We will sing one song , " he sang . He stopped and began again . " We will sing one song , " he sang again , but he stopped again and112I 'll Take You Home Againimmediately began again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a song , Ulysses , " Homer said . " That 's only a little part of a song . Now you listen to me , and then sing with me . " The older brother began to sing while the younger brother listened . " Weep no more , my lady , 0 weep no more today We will sing one song for the old Kentucky home For the old Kentucky home far away " " Sing it again , Homer , " Ulysses said . " O.K. , " Homer said , and began the song again , but this time the younger brother sang with the older , and as they sang Ulysses saw the freight train again with the Negro leaning over the side of the gondola , smiling and waving . That was one of the most wonderful things that had ever happened to Ulysses Macauley in his four years of life in the world . He waved to a man and the man waved back to him  --  not once , but many times . He would remember that as long as he lived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and carefully set Ulysses on his feet . They stood together a moment , listening to the harp and piano of their mother and sister and the singing of their neighbor , Mary Arena . " All right , Ulysses , " Homer said , " you 're home now . Go on in . Mama 's there , and Bess and Mary . I 've got to go on to work . " " Going to work ? " Ulysses said . I13The Human Comedy " Yes , " Homer said , " but I 'll be home tonight . Go on in , Ulysses . " The younger brother started up the front porch steps . When he got to the door , the older brother began to ride on down the street . THREE SOLDIERSWhen the Steed family and their guests , includingThomas Spangler , sat down to dinner , a heavy rain was falling over Ithaca . Bess Macauley and Mary Arena , in raincoats and galoshes , walked to the telegraph office , bearing Homer 's lunch-box . As they passed the Owl Drug Store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old wolf eye . " Hi-ya , pretty , " he said to Bess . " What 's with ? " Bess ignored the young man and moved closer to Mary as they went up the street . Now , coming toward them were three young soldiers . They were sporting around in the street at a game improvised " 5The Human Comedy Three Soldiersout of their happiness at being free for the night , out of the noble and ridiculous world and its constant comedy , and out of the refreshing rain . They pushed and chased one another , roaring with uncontrollable laughter , and calling out the nicknames they had given one another  --  Fat , Texas , and Horse . When the three boys saw Mary and Bess they came to a worshipful halt . They bowed very low , one after another . The girls were pleased , but they were n't sure what they ought to do  --  what attitude they ought to take . " They 're just soldiers , Bess , " Mary whispered  --  " away from home . " " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face the three soldiers . The one called Fat stepped forward as the official representative of the group  --  the soldiers ' ambassador to American girls .

May I present my comrades and your devoted admirers . This is Texas  --  he 's from New Jersey . This is Horse  --  he 's from Texas . And I 'm Fat  --  I 'm from hunger . Now more than anything else I hunger for the companionshipof beautiful American girls . How about it ? " " Well , " Bess said , " we were going to the Kinema . " " To the Kinema ! " Fat said dramatically . " May we  --  soldiers  --  whether here today or gone tomorrow  --  accompany you  --  American girls  --  to the Kinema @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow we return to barracks , to the awful but necessary business of war , to the holy work of destroyingthe murderous microbe in man which seeks to crush man 's free spirit . Tonight we are your brothers  --  far from our own firesides , and lonely . Yes , although happy and proud , we are lonely , for Ithaca is not our native land . I have waddled into this costume of the American soldier from the side streets of that ferocious city Chicago , of that sweet nation Illinois . Restore me to that city and to that nation tonight in memory , and restore my good brothers each to his good place . Consider with generous hearts our humble petition , for we are of one family , the human , and except for war we might never meet . This moment is by the gentler centuries made . " The soldier who was called Fat bowed , then stood upright . " What is your decision ? " he said . " Is he crazy ? " Mary whispered . " No , " Bess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the movie with them . " " All right , Bess , " Mary said , " but you tell him . I do n't know what to say . " Bess turned to the soldier . " All right , " she said . The Human Comedy " Thank you , ladies , " the soldier called Fat said . " Thank you . " He offered his arm to Bess . " Shall we go , then ? " he said . " First I 've got to take my brother his lunch-box , " Bess said . " He works at the telegraph office . It wo n't take a minute . " " Telegraph ? " the soldier called Fat said . " Then I shall send a telegram . " He turned to the others . " How about you , Texas ? " " How much does it cost to send a telegram to New Jersey ? " Texas said . " Not nearly as much as it 's worth , " Fat said . He turned to the other soldier . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horse said . " I think I 'd like to send a telegram to Ma and Joe and Kitty  --  that 's my girl , " he said to Bess . " Every girl in the world is my girl , " Fat said , " and as I can not send telegrams to each of them , I shall send a telegram to only one . I shall send millions of telegrams in the one telegram . " Willie Grogan , the old telegraph operator , was alone in the office when the two young women and the three soldiers walked in . The old man stood behind the counter . " I 'm Homer 's sister Bess , " Bess said . " I 've brought his lunch . " She put the box on the counter . " How do you do , Miss Macauley , " Grogan said . " Homer will be in soon . I 'll see that he gets his lunch . " 118Three Soldiers " And these boys want to send telegrams , " Bess said . " Very well , young men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How much does it cost to send a telegram to Jersey City ? " Texas said . " Twenty-five words for fifty cents , " Grogan said , " plus a small tax . But do n't count the address or the signature . The telegram will be delivered tomorrow morning . " " Fifty cents ? " Texas said . " That 's not bad at all . " He began to write his telegram . " How much does it cost to San Antone ? " Horse said . " Half as much as to Jersey City , " Grogan said . " San Antonio is nearer Ithaca than Jersey City . " The soldier called Fat who had been busy writing his telegram now handed it to the old man . Grogan read the telegram as he counted it .

On the screen at the Kinema Theatre , as the three soldiers and the two American girls walked down the center aisle , Mr. Winston Churchill , Prime Minister of England in the year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament . By the time the young people were seated , Mr. Churchill had said three things , one after another , which had caused increasing delight both to the members of the Canadian House of Parliament and to the members of the audience at the Kinema120Three SoldiersTheatre in Ithaca . The soldier called Fat leaned over to Bess Macauley . " There , " he said , " is one of the great men of our time  --  and a great American , too . " " I thought Churchill was an Englishman , " the soldier called Horse said . " Sure , " Fat said , " but he 's an American , too . From now on every good man in the world is going to be an American . " He moved just a little closer to the girl on the other side of him , Mary Arena . " Thanks a lot for letting us come to the movie with you , " he said . " It feels better to have girls near . It smells better than just soldiers . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now the man named Franklin Delano Roosevelt , President of the United States , appeared in the newsreel , making a radio speech to the nation from his home in Hyde Park . He spoke with his usual mixture of solemnity and humor . The five young peoplelistened carefully and the whole audience applaudedwhen the speech was ended . " There 's the greatest American of them all , " the soldier called Horse said . At that moment the Americanflag appeared on the screen and a good portion of the audience began to applaud . " And there , " the soldier called Texas said , " is the greatest flag in the world . " " I do n't know  --  , " the soldier called Fat said to Bess .  --  " A man does n't begin to really love his country121The Human Comedyuntil it 's in trouble . All the rest of the time he takes it for granted  --  like his family . " " I get a lump in my throat every time I see the flag , " Bess said . " It used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes me think of my brother Marcus . He 's a soldier , too . " " Oh , you 've got a brother in the Army ? " Fat said . " Yes , " Bess said . " He was somewhere in North Carolina the last time we heard from him . " " Well , " Fat said , " I guess the flag makes every person think of what 's nearest and most precious to him . It makes me think of Chicago  --  and that means everything in it  --  everything good and everythingbad , too . My family  --  my girl  --  they 're good . And the slums and politics  --  they 're bad  --  but I love them all . We 'll get rid of the slums some day , and the politics , too . " " I do n't suppose we have slums in Ithaca , " Bess said  --  " just poor people . I guess we 've got some kind of city government , but I do n't suppose we 've got much politics to speak of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anyway . We like music . I just bet my brother Marcus is playing the accordionsomewhere right now . " Her brother Marcus was at that moment at a bar in a saloon called The Dive Bomber in a small town in North Carolina . His friend Tobey George and three other soldiers were at the bar with him . Marcus was playing the song called A Dream , and Tobey was singing . Two soldiers danced in the122Three Soldierssaloon with two girls , not unlike Mary and Bess . After the song , Tobey sat down beside his friend Marcus and asked him to talk some more about Ithaca and the Macauleys there . As Marcus Macauley began to tell Tobey George about Ithaca , Thomas Spangler and Diana Steed came down the aisle of the Kinema Theatre . Now , the feature picture began to appear on the screen . When they were seated the screen was filling with words , not pictures . These words named the picture and the people who had helped to make the picture . There were vast numbers of words , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Accompanying these credits was a **25;8939;TOOLONG theme of music which had been especially composed for the occasion . Spangler and Diana sat very close to the screen , in the third row , ten rows in front of Bess and Mary and the three soldiers . Their seats were at the very center of a row whose only other occupants were small boys . Now on the screen appeared the spick and span linoleum-floored hall of a hospital . Over a loud-speaker at the end of the hall came the harsh voice of a bitter nurse who spoke over-emphatically . " Dr. Cavanagh ! " she cried . " Surgery ! Dr. Cavanagh ! Surgery ! " Immediately upon hearing these words Thomas Spangler got to his feet . He had had a few to drink and the evening had been a rather important and pleasant one for him , full of troubles which were123The Human Comedy Three Soldiersnow working themselves out , it seemed , so that he felt no need at all not to carry on as if he himself were no older than the others in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Wrong movie ! " He took Diana 's hand and said , " Come on . " " But , darling , the movie is n't over yet ! " the young woman whispered . Spangler dragged her along . " It 's over for me , " he said . " Come on . " Now they were passing a small boy who was watching the screen with great fascination . " You 'll get to Heaven , " Spangler said to the boy , and then to Diana , " Come on , come on , do n't stand in the boy 's way . " " But , darling , " Diana said , " the movie 's just be-ginning . " Now the boy spoke to Spangler . " What did you say , mister ? " he said . " Heaven !  --  Heaven ! " Spangler said . " I say you 'll get there . " The boy was n't sure he understood what Spangler meant . " Have you got the time ? " he said . " No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still early . " " Yes , sir , " the boy said . Now Spangler and the young woman were walkingup the aisle of the movie theater . " We 'll go to Corbett 's , " Spangler said . " Have a couple of drinks , listen to the pianola , and then you124 125can go home . " He turned in order to face the screen and began walking backward . " Look at Dr. Cavanagh , will you ? " he said . " He 's going to do something with that pair of pliers . Probablyget confused and pull out one of his front teeth . Look at him ! " In the lobby of the theater the young woman did not mind so much leaving the picture so soon after its beginning . " You do love me , do n't you ? " she said to Spangler . " Yes , you do . You know you do . " " Love you ? " Spangler almost shouted . " I took you to a movie , did n't I ? " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , moving close to the buildings in order to keep out of the rain . CHAPTER 18MR . GROGAN ON WARMr . Grogan on Wartook the box and said , " There 's enough of it . Will you have some lunch with me , Mr. Grogan ? " " Thank you , boy , " the old telegraph operator said . " I 'm not hungry . " " Maybe if you start to eat a little , " Homer said ,  --  your appetite will improve , Mr. Grogan.  --  " No , " the old man said , " thanks very much . But you 're soaking wet . Look here , we 've got rain-coats . " " Yeah , " Homer said , " but I got caught in the rain . " Homer bit into a sandwich . " I 'll eat this one sandwich , " he said , " and then I 'll deliver the telegram . " He chewed a moment and then looked over at the old telegraph operator . " What kind of a telegramis it ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homer knew the telegram was another death message . He stopped chewing and gulped the food down dry . " I wish I did n't have to deliver telegrams like this , " the messenger said to the telegraph operator . " I know , " Mr. Grogan said slowly . He did n't speak again for half a minute , while the messenger held the unfinished sandwich in his hand without taking another bite . " Go ahead , boy , " Mr. Grogan said , " eat your lunch . Your sister was with another girl  --  a very pretty girl . " " Oh , that 's Mary , " Homer said . " She 's our neighbor . She 's Marcus 's girl . My brother  --  in the Army . They 're going to be married after the War . " As Spangler and Diana ran through the rain towardCorbett 's , Homer Macauley , soaking wet , brought his bicycle to a stop in front of the telegraph office and went in . He looked over the situationat the delivery desk . There were no calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Grogan finished a telegram he was typing and got up . " Your sister Bess brought your lunch , boy , " he said . " She did ? " Homer said . " Ah , she did n't need to bring any lunch . I was going to get us two pies . " He126 127The Human Comedy " Your sister and Mary were with three soldiers who sent telegrams , " the old telegraph operator said . " Is that so ? " Homer said . " Where are the tele-grams ? " Mr. Grogan indicated the hook on which dispatchedtelegrams were placed . Homer took the telegrams off the hook and one by one read them . After having read them , he looked up at the old telegraph operator . " If a fellow dies that way , Mr. Grogan , " the messengersaid , " somebody you know , or somebody you do n't know , somebody you 've never even seen  --  does it make anything better ? This is only Ithaca . This is only one little town in America . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to every kind of people there is . What about these people ? They do n't just die for nothing , do they ? " The old telegraph operator waited a moment beforespeaking , and then , as if there was so much to say that he would n't be able to make it alone , he went to the drawer of his table and got out his bottle . He took a good long swig , sat down , and looked over at the messenger . " I 've been a long time in the world , " he said . " Too long perhaps . Let me tell you that in war or in peace , nothing is for nothing  --  least of all dying . The old man stopped a moment to take another swig . " All people are one , " he said , " as you are one . Now , as there is mischief in you along with good , there is mischief and good in all people . It is mixed128Mr . Grogan on Warin all of them , the millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . As a man 's conscience struggles with the opposites in his own nature , so do these oppositesstruggle in the whole body of the living  --  in the whole world . And that is when we have a war . The body is fighting off its diseases . But do n't you worry about it , because the good endures forever and the evil is driven away every time it appears . The sick body and the sick spirit are always restored to health . They may take sick again but they will always get better , and as each fresh disease comes and is driven off , the body and spirit strengthen until at last they are powerful , as they were meant to be , cleansed of all decay , refined , gentler , nobler , and beyond corruption . Every man in the world , right or wrong , is trying . " The old man was a little weary now . " The thief and the murderer are trying , " he sighed . " Nobody dies for nothing . They die seeking grace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one day that great body of man  --  all of us , every last one of us  --  shall reach home , shall have grace , shall be immortal , and this wonderful evil world shall be a place of decency and goodness among men . " The old man sighed deeper than ever now and then after a moment brought out a small slip of paper from his vest pocket . He handed the paper to the messenger . " Will you go on an errand for me again , " he said , " to the drug store ? " 129The Human Comedy " Yes , sir , " Homer said , and hurried out of the office . William Grogan stood alone in the telegraph office , looking around with a strange affection for everything , mixed with a kind of loving fury . Almostslowly he clutched his heart as if he had been waiting patiently for the swift attack which no longer could surprise him . He moved back to his chair and sat in a terrible stiffness until the attack had spent its most extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed the telegraph operator the small box . " Water , " the old man said . Homer filled a paper cup full of water and took it to the old man , who dumped three of the pills out of the little box , tossed them into his mouth , took the cup from Homer , and swallowed the pills . " Thank you , " he said , " thank you , my boy . " " Yes , sir , " Homer said . He looked at the old man a moment to see if he was going to be all right , then went to the deliverydesk and took up the telegram of death . He stood a moment holding the telegram and looking at it , and then he opened the envelope and took the message out of it , to read . He put the telegram back into a new envelope , sealed it , and then turned and walked out of the office into the rain . The old telegraph operator got up out of his chair and followed the boy into the street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push against the wind130Mr . Grogan on Warand the rain . Inside the office the telegraph box began to rattle , but the old man did n't hear . The telephone rang , but again the old man did n't hear . He did not turn and go back into the office until the telephone had rung seven times. 131CHAPTER 19TO MOTHER , WITH LOVEFifteen minutes later Homer Macauley got off his bicycle in front of a large fine old house where a party was in progress . Through the windows the messenger could see four young couples dancing , and as he was sure everybody inside the house was happy , the boy felt sick and terrified . He went to the door of the house and stood a moment , listening to the music . He moved a finger toward the door bell and then let his hand drop . " I 'll go back to the office , " he said to himself aloud . " I 'll quit . I do n't want a job like this . " He sat down on the steps of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up and went to the door and pressed his finger against the button . When the door opened he saw a young woman , and before he knew what he was doing he turned and ran to his bicycle . The young woman came out on the porch of the house and called out , " Why , what 's the matter , boy ? " Homer got off his bicycle and walked to the porch slowly . " I 'm sorry , " he said to the young woman . " I 've got a telegram for Mrs. Claudia Beaufrere . " " It 's Mother 's birthday , " the young woman said cheerfully . She turned and stepped into the hallway of the house . " Mother , " she called out , " here 's a telegram for you . " The girl 's mother came to the door . " It 's from Alan , I 'm sure , " she said . " Come in , young man , " she said to Homer . " You must have a piece of my birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Homer said . " I 've got to go back to work . " He held the telegram out to the woman , who took it as if it were nothing more than a birthday greeting . " Nonsense , " she said cheerfully  --  " not until you 've had a piece of cake and a glass of punch . " She tugged at Homer 's arm and dragged him into the room to a table loaded with cake and sandwiches and punch . The music and dancing continued . " It 's my birthday , boy , " the woman said . " Lord , " she laughed , " I am old . Well , you must wish me happiness , boy . " She handed Homer a glass of punch. 133The Human Comedy " I wish you  --  " Homer began to say . He stopped , and then began again . " I wish you  --  " But he could n't go on . He put the glass of punch on the table and bolted to the door . The mother looked around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be noticed , and the daughter , watching the mother , moved to the other side . Homer was on his bicycle hurrying through the rain back to the telegraph office . On the wall of the hall , in front of the mother , was a framed picture of a good-looking redheadedboy . Written on the photograph were the words , " To Mother with love from Alan on his 12th birthday . " The mother opened the telegram , read it , and without a sound began to sob , while the phonograph continued with a song called Chanson pour Ma Brune , and the happy people continued to dance . The daughter looked across the room at her mother in the hallway . Almost as if she had lost her reason , she rushed to the phonograph and turned it off . " Mother ! " the girl cried , and ran toward the woman in the hallway. 134CHAPTER 20IT 'S YOUR MISFORTUNEAND NONE OF MY OWNNow , the Kinema Theatre was letting out its visitors after the last show . In the street Bess turned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must go home now . " " Thank you , ladies , " the soldier called Fat said . It was time for them to say good-by , and yet somehowthey stood together in the street , waiting , as if something wonderful but unknowable was on the verge of happening . The soldier called Fat looked from Bess to Mary , and then very easily and innocentlykissed Bess and then Mary. 135The Human ComedyNow , the soldier called Horse shouted , " Well , what about us ? What about me and Texas ? We 're somebody , too . We 're in the Army , too . " So this soldier kissed Bess and Mary , too . And after him Texas kissed them . A woman in the street watched with bitter distaste . The girls turned quickly and hurried down the street . The soldier called Horse jumped , and then pushed the soldier called Texas , who turned and pushed the soldier called Fat . They moved down the side street , shouting at one another . " Waaa-h000 ! Oh you Texas ! Oh you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boy ! " Texas shouted to Fat . " How you talk ! Old Senator Fat from the University of Chicago ! " The soldier called Fat cackled with delight as they moved on down the dark street , pushing and laughing and shouting . " Oh man ! " the soldier called Fat shouted . " When I get to Congress ! I 'll tell them a thing or two . " " Yippee-aye-ay , " Horse shouted . " Git along little dogies  --  it 's your misfortune and none of my own . " Now the three soldiers began leaping over one another at a swift , crazy game of leap-frog , pushing down the dark , immortal street nearer and nearer to the War. 136CHAPTER 21A BETTER WORLD , ABETTER PEOPLEBy the time the unhappy messenger got back to the telegraph office from the Beaufrere home , the rain had stopped , the moon was shining , and an empty and exhausted cluster of clouds , now white , was being driven across the sky . The messenger was very tired when he came limping into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boy ? " the old telegraph operator said . " You 've been limping all day . " " It 's nothing , " Homer said . " Any more tele-grams ? " 137The Human Comedy " All clear , " Mr. Grogan said , " and soon you can go home to bed . Now tell me . What happened to your leg ? " " I guess I twisted a ligament or broke it , or something , " Homer said . He tried his leg out . " I was running the two-twenty low hurdles , " he said . " The coach out at Ithaca High School never did like me , I guess . I was running first when he came out to the track and tried to stop me  --  it was my own fault , I guess . I saw him coming and I could have stopped if I had wanted to , but I did n't want to . He did n't have any right to stop me , so I hurdled anyway  --  and we both fell down . The other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Hubert Ackley the Third did it . He 's a boy I never did used to like . Rich family , very good manners . Besides , the girl I like likes him . Helen Eliot . The more she likes him the more I get burned up and like her . I do n't suppose she notices me , even . Well , I guess she ca n't very well not notice me , but I guess she thinks I think I 'm a smart-aleck . I do n't think she likes me at all . Maybe she hates me  --  the girl I love more than anybody else in the whole world  --  outside of my own family . You see , Mr. Grogan , this coach out there  --  his name is Byfieldwell , I guess he 's all right if you can understand him , only I do n't know anybody who can understand him . He 's always going around making trouble . Miss Hicks says he tells lies , too . Miss Hicks is our ancient-history teacher . She 's been teaching at Ithaca138A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She taught my brother Marcus and my sister Bess . Of course , after we fell I got right up and began to run again and the other guys started too  --  fair and square . I knew something was wrong with my leg but I did n't stop to think about it at the time because I wanted to win . I did n't want to win just to win  --  I did n't want to beat Ackley  --  that guy surprised me . He stopped the others from running because Mr. Byfield had interfered with my running . Ackley 's a good guy , I guess  --  he 's just got refined manners , that 's all . To tell you the truth , Mr. Grogan , the main reason I wanted to run the two-twenty low hurdles at first was because Mr. Spangler ran that race when he went to Ithaca High , but after what happened I wanted to win the race for Miss Hicks . " You see , me and Ackley got into a little argumentin the classroom , so of course she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the coach out there , came to Miss Hicks and lied to her . He took Ackley with him to run the race but he did n't take me . Miss Hicks said he lied the same as he used to lie when he was in her ancient history class . Her feelingswere very hurt . I guess she just ca n't stand peoplegoing around that way telling lies . She talked to me  --  told me about my brother Marcus  --  and then she told me to go out and run the race . Mr. Spangler was Valley Champion of that race , and I guess I 'd like to be Valley Champion some day myself , too . I do n't think I 'll be able to make it this year , though . " 139The Human ComedyThe messenger flexed his leg a couple of times . " I guess I 'll rub some liniment on it tonight . Is the limp noticeable ? " " Well , " Mr. Grogan said , " it 's not too noticeable , but it is a little noticeable . Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Homer said . " It hurts a little , especially when I get the left leg up , so I try to do all the pumpingwith my right leg and let the left leg just sort of coast along . Sometimes I take it off the pedal and let it hang . That way it rests . I guess something 's happened to the ligament  --  I 'll rub it with lini-ment . " There was a pause . Then the old telegraph operatorsaid , " You 've changed some since you came to work three clays ago , have n't you ? " " Have you noticed it , Mr. Grogan ? " the messenger said . " Yeah , I guess I 've changed all right . I guess I 've grown up . And I guess it was time for me to grow up . I did n't know anything until I got this job . Oh , I knew a lot of things , but I did n't know the half of it , and I guess I never will , either . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I should . Everybody says I 'm the smartest guy at Ithaca High , even people who do n't like me . But I 'm not so smart . I guess I 'm just as backward as anybody in a lot of things  --  important things , too . I want to know and I 'll always want to know . I 'll always keep trying , but how can you ever know ? How can any man ever140A Better World , a Better Peoplereally get it all straight so that it comes out even and makes sense ? " " Well , " the old telegraph operator said , " I do n't know how anybody is ever going to know , but I 'm glad you 've made up your mind to keep trying . " " I 've got to keep trying , " the messenger said . " You know , Mr. Grogan , I do n't know about other people , and I do n't know whether I can tell you this or not , but I 'm not just the guy people see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't even know what to make of it . " The messenger went on , because he was tired and something was wrong with his leg and he had taken the message of death into the happy home and because he knew the old telegraph operator was a good man . " The ideas I get , " he said . " A different world , a better world , a better people , a better way of doing things . " He paused a moment and then went on . " I 'd be ashamed to say this to anybody but you , Mr. Grogan , but some day I 'm going to go to work and do something . I do n't know what it 's going to be , but it 's going to be something . I did n't used to know anything  --  Iguess I was in a kind of happy daydream all the time . My whole family is happy . We 're a happy kind of people , but I know I did n't used to know anything . Now I 'm beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more every day . This and that , and this and that and the other thing . " The messengerstopped again , testing his leg to see if it had become healed as he talked . It had n't . " I do n't like141The Human Comedy A Better World , a Better Peoplethe way things are , Mr. Grogan , " he said . " I do n't know why , but I want them to be better . I guess it 's because I think they ought to be better . I 've learned this much so far  --  that I do n't know anything , but from now on I 'm going to try to learn  --  all the time . I 'm going to be watching all the time . I 'm going to be thinking about it all the time . It makes a guy feel lonely , but I do n't care about that . We 're a happy people all right , but we 're tough , too . I do n't care about being lonely myself . I care about people who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me the world is full of people like that . I did n't know that before . Now I do n't even care if Helen Eliot does n't like me . I wish she did , though , but if she does n't , that 's O.K. I like her . I love her with all my heart , but if she wants to like Hubert Ackley the Third instead of me , that 's O.K. He 's a good guy , and I guess a refined girl like Helen Eliot likes to have a guy who 's got good manners like Hubert Ackley the Third . I guess I have n't got any manners at all . I just do what I think is right and what I 've got to do . At school I say a lot of funny things , but I do n't do it to make trouble for the teachers . I do it because I 've got to . Everybody 's so sad or mixed up , and everything 's so slow or wrong that I 've just got to say funny things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some fun out of being alive . I do n't suppose I could be refined or polite on purpose even if I wanted to be . I could n't be polite if I did n't mean it . " The messenger flexed his leg again and spoke of it now as if it were n't his own . " Something 's the matter with it , " he said . He glanced up at the clock . " Well , Mr. Grogan , " he said , " it 's five minutes after twelve . I guess I 'll go home . I do n't feel very sleepy tonight , though . Tomorrow 's Saturday . Saturday used to be the best day of all for me . No more , though . I guess I 'll come down to the office . Maybe I can help out . " He lifted the lunch-box off the deliverydesk . " Would n't you like a sandwich now , Mr. Grogan ? " he said . " Well , " the old telegraph operator said , " come to think of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry now . " Mr. Grogan took a sandwich out of the open box and bit into it . " Please thank your mother for me . " " Ah , it 's nothing , " the messenger said . " No , " Mr. Grogan said . " It is something . Please thank her for me . " " Yes , sir , " Homer said , and left the office to go home . CHAPTER 22LET THERE BE LIGHTAlone in the telegraph office , Mr. William Grogan , once young , once the fastest telegraph operatorin the world , slowly began to clear off the work table . He hummed softly to himself a theme which had stayed in his memory from the earliest days of his life . As the old man did his work , Thomas Spangler , fresh from Corbett 's and a little under the influence of alcohol and a mixture of giddy and solemn happiness , came into the office and went to his desk . He glanced over at the old telegraph operator , but did not speak . They had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be at work forLet There Be Lightan hour or two without exchanging one word . Spangler lifted the good-luck egg off a pile of telegramsand studied its amazing symmetry . Then he put the egg back on the pile of telegrams and , remembering the girl pleasantly , he puckered up his lips in order to speak as she was given to speaking . " You do love me , do n't you ? " he said . " Yes , you do . " The old telegraph operator glanced at the managerof the office . " What 's that , Tom ? " he said . " Willie , " Spangler said , " what would you think of a young woman who tells you like this : You do love me , do n't you ? You do , you do ! You know you do ! ' " " Well , " Mr. Grogan said , " I do n't know what I 'd think . " " Would you like a young woman like that , Willie ? " Spangler said , and then continued his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you ? That 's what she says all the time . " Spangler rubbed his face as if to get over the great happiness and then said , " Anything doing tonight ? " " About the same , " Mr. Grogan said , " except for the rain . " " How 's the new messenger ? " Spangler said . " Is he all right ? " " The best I 've ever seen , " the telegraph operator said . " What do you think of him ? " 144 145The Human Comedy Let There Be Light " I liked him from the time he came up and asked for a job , " Spangler said . " You do love me , do n't you ? " He could not get over the wondrous way Diana Steed spoke the small words . " I 'm glad you like the messenger , " Spangler went on . " Do n't bother to close the office , Willie . I 'll do it myself . I 've got a little work I want to attend to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? Homer Macauley . What do you think his father called him Homer for instead of Thomas or Williamor Henry or something like that ? " Spangler did n't wait for a reply but went on to say , " Yes , you do . " Mr. Grogan said , " Homer 's brother is called Ulysses , but his sister is called Bess . " " Homer , Ulysses , and Bess , " Spangler said . " And another brother , " Mr. Grogan said , " is called Marcus . He 's in the Army . " " Marcus , Homer , Ulysses and Bess , " Spangler said . " Why do n't you go home , Willie ? " " Home ? " Mr. Grogan said . He smiled . " If youdo n't mind , Tom , " he said , " I 'd like to sit aroundwith you . I 've got nowhere to go and nothing to doafter work except sleep , and I do n't enjoy sleeping . " " Now , Willie , " Spangler said as if he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to worry . Iknow you do worry , but you do n't need to . You'renot old , and nobody in the world is going to put youon a pension . You know very well I 'd be helpless in146this office without you . You 'll live to be a hundred , and you 'll work every day of your life . " " Thanks , " the old telegraph operator said . He paused and then said softly , " I had another little attack tonight . Oh , nothing serious . I felt it coming on for some time . The boy was here . I sent him for the medicine . I 'm not supposed to take it , you know . I 'm supposed to see the doctor and I 'm supposed to rest . " " Doctors do n't know everything , Willie , " Spanglersaid . " They understand matter , not spirit , and you and I live in the spirit . " And then suddenly he said , " You do love me , do n't you ? Doctors do n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe you ought to rest a little anyway . " " Oh , I 'll rest , " Mr. Grogan said . " I 'll take the great rest , Tom . " " Willie , " Spangler said , " go to Corbett 's on the corner and have yourself a drink . Listen to the pianola . Come back and we 'll talk over the old times  --  Wolinsky and Tomlinson and old man Davenport . Harry Bull the lineman , crazy Fred McIntyre , and wonderful Jerry Beattie . Go ahead now , Willie . Have yourself a drink or two , and when you come back we 'll kick around the old times . " " I 'm not supposed to drink , Tom , " Mr. Grogan said . " You know I 'm not supposed to drink . " " Sure I know you 're not supposed to drink , " Spangler said , " but I also know you like to drink and what a man likes to do is sometimes more impor-147The Human Comedy tant than what he is supposed to do  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right , Tom , " Mr. Grogan said , and left the office . On the sidewalk for the past three or four minutes a young man had passed the office several times , looking in . He came in at last and stood at the counter . Spangler noticed him and went over . " How are you ? " Spangler said , remembering the boy . " I thought you 'd be on your way home to Penn- Sylvania long ago . Your mother sent you the money . You did n't need to come back to pay me . " " I did n't come back to pay you , " the young man said . " I came back to get more , and I did n't come to beg it . " He coughed . " I came to take it . " " What 's the matter with you ? " Spangler said . " This is what 's the matter with me , " the young man said . From his right-hand coat pocket he brought out a revolver and held it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little drunk and happy , could n't understand . " Come on , " the young man said . " Give me the money  --  all the money you 've got in this place . Everybody 's killing everybody and I do n't mind if I kill you . And I do n't mind if I 'm killed . I 'm ex- cited and I do n't want any trouble , but if you do n't give me all the money  --  now  --  I 'll shoot . Give me the money , and hurry . " Spangler drew open the cash drawer and took the money out of the several compartments . He placed LC , 1 ! GG ! G LG LGY /GGthe money  --  currency , rolls of coin and open coinsonthe counter before the boy . " I 'd give you the money , anyway , " he said , " but not because you 're pointing a gun at me . I 'd give it to you because you need it . Here . This is all the money there is . Take it and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you belong . I wo n't report a theft . I 'll make it good myself . There 's about seventy-fivedollars here . " He waited for the boy to take the money , but the boy would n't touch it . " I mean it , " Spangler said . " Take the money and go  --  you need it . You 're no criminal , and you 're not so sick you ca n't get well . Your mother 's waiting for you . This money is a gift from me to her . You wo n't be a thief taking it . Just take the money , put that gun away and go home . Throw the gun awayyou'llfeel better . " The young man put the gun back into his coat pocket . Over his trembling mouth he placed the hand which had held the gun . " I ought to go out and shoot myself , " he said . " Do n't talk like a fool , " the manager of the telegraph office said . He gathered the money togetherand held it out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " This is all the money there is . Take it and go home , that 's all . If you like , leave the gun here with me .

I know how you feel because I 've felt the same way. 148 149The Human Comedy Let There Be LightWe 've all felt the same way . The graveyards and penitentiaries are full of good American kids who 've had bad luck and hard times . They 're not criminals . Here , " he said gently , " take this money . Go home . " The young man brought the gun out of his pocket and pushed it across the counter to Spangler , who dropped it into the cash drawer . " I do n't know who you are , " he said , " but no one has ever talked to me the way you have . I do n't want the gun , and I wo n't take the money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , and I 'll bum my way back . " He coughed a moment and then said , " I do n't know where my mother got the thirty dollars . I know she has no money to spare . I spent some of the money drinking . I gambled some , and  --  " " Come on in and sit down , " Spangler said . After a moment the young man went to the chair beside Spangler 's desk . Spangler sat down on the desk . " What 's the matter ? " he said to the young man . " I do n't know exactly , " the young man said . " I think I 'm sick  --  maybe T.B . I 'm not sure . If I have n't got it , I guess I ought to have it , the way I 've been living . I do n't like to complain . I 've had a lot of bad luck , but I know it 's my own fault . I 'll go now . Thanks a lot  --  I ' 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man turned to leave the office . " Wait a minute , " Spangler said . " Sit down . Take it easy . You 've got a lot of time  --  now . You 're not rushing things any more . From now on , move a little slower . What 's a fellow like you interested in ? " 150 " I do n't know , " the young man said . " I do n't know which way to go , or what to do when I get there , or what to believe , or anything . My father was a preacher , but he 's been dead since I was three years old . I just do n't know what to do . " He looked at Spangler . " What is there to do ? " he said . " Oh , nothing in particular , " Spangler said . " Anything . It does n't matter what a man does . Any good honest work . " " I 've always been restless and dissatisfied , " the young man said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . I do n't like people . I do n't like being near them . I do n't trust them . I do n't like the way they live or talk or the things they believe , or the way they push each other around . " " Every man in the world feels that way at one time or another , " Spangler said . " It 's not that I do n't understand myself , " the young man said . " I guess I do . I 've got no alibis . I 'm responsible for everything . Now , I 'm just tired and fed-up and sick . Nothing interests me . The whole world 's gone crazy . I ca n't live the kind of life I want to live and I do n't feel like living any other kind . It 's not money that I want or need . I know I could get a job , especially now . But I do n't like the people you 've got to get jobs from . They 're no good . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let anybody push me around . I tried to hold a few jobs in York , Pennsylvania . I always had a fight and got fired . Three or four days , a week , or a151The Human Comedy Let There Be Lightweek and a half . The longest I ever held a job was one month . " I tried to enlist in the Army in York because I thought that might be a good thing to do  --  go somewhere  --  getkilled maybe . If they boss you in the Army at least it 's for something that 's supposed to be halfway decent . I do n't know whether it really is decent or not , but at least it 's supposed to be . They turned me down . I could n't pass the physical examination . It was n't my lungs only  --  it was other things too . I did n't bother to find out . " The young man began to cough again , but this time he coughed for almost a full minute . Spangler brought a small bottle out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " take a drink of this . " " Thanks , " the young man said . " I drink a little too much , but I need a drink now . " He took a swallowfrom the bottle , then handed it back to Spangler . " Thanks , " he said . Spangler decided he ought to urge the young man to go on talking . " What do you read ? " he said . " Oh , everything , " the young man said . " At least I used to when I was home . My father had a lot of books  --  not religious books only  --  good books  --  by good writers . My favorite was William Blake . Maybeyou know his stuff . Shakespeare , Milton , Pope , Donne , Dickens , Thackeray  --  all of them . I read every book my father had  --  some of them twice , a few three times . I used to like to read , but no more . Now I do n't even want to look at newspapers . I152know the news . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every day , and not one man in the world shocked about it . " He held his head in his hands and , speaking softly , he went on without looking up . " I ca n't thank you for what you 've done and for the kind of human being you are , " he said . " I must tell you I would have shot you if you had been afraid of me or unkind . Everybody in the world is afraid or unkind . I know now that I did n't come here with a gun for money . I do n't know whether you will understand , but I came here with a gun to find out once and for all if the only man in the world I have ever known who has been decent to another man just to be decent  --  just for itself  --  was truly so . I came to find out if it was n't an accident . I could n't believe anybody could be really decent , because it made my whole feeling about everything and everybody untrue  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human race is hopeless and corrupt , that there is n't one man in the world worthy of being truly human , worthy of another man 's respect . For a long time I 've had contempt for the patheticas well as for the proud , and then suddenly thousands of miles from home , in a strange city , I found a man who was decent . It bothered me . It bothered me for a long time . I could n't believe it . I had to find out . I wanted it to be true . I wanted to believe it , because I 've been telling myself for years : Let me find one man uncorrupted by the world so that I may be uncorrupted , so that I may believe153The Human Comedy Let There Be Lightand live . ' I was n't sure the first time we met , but I 'm sure now . I want nothing more from you . You 've given me everything I want . You ca n't give me anything more . You understand , I know . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need n't worry about me . I 'm going home where I belong . I 'm not going to die of this sickness . I 'm going to live . And now I 'm going to know how to live . " The young man did not lift his head for a moment . Then he got up slowly and looked at Spangler . " Thanks a lot , " he said . Spangler watched the young man walk out of the office . He went to the cash drawer and put the money back where it belonged . He took the young man 's revolver and unloaded it . He put the revolver back in the drawer and dropped the shells into his coat pocket . Then he went to the steel rack where each day 's telegrams were tied into a bundle . In one bundle he found the telegram the boy had sent his mother . The manager of the telegraph office took a fresh telegraph blank and began to write a telegram . He wrote : MRS . MARGARET STRICKMAN1874 BIDDLE STREETYORK , PENNSYLVANIADEAR MA : THANKS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FINE . He read the words of the message and then decided to change " fine " to " O.K. " Then he remembered the young man a moment and added , " Love , John . " He went to Mr. Grogan 's place at the telegraph table and called for an operator . His call was answered after several moments and then Spangler tapped out the telegram , after which he talked to the operator at the other end , smiling as he listened to the dots and dashes and made his answers . When he was through talking he got up and went to his own desk . William Grogan came in and sat in the chair where the young man had been sitting . " How do you feel now ? " Spangler said to the old telegraph operator . " Better , of course , " Mr. Grogan said . " I had two drinks , Tom . I listened to the soldiers singing . They love that pianola and those old songs  --  songs they never heard before . " " You do love me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do . You know you do . That 's what she says , Willie , " Spangler said to the old telegraph operator , " and that 's the way she says it . I believe I 'm going to marry her . " Spangler stopped dreaming of Diana Steed a moment to study the face of his old friend . " The old songs , " he said , " are O.K. " " Tom , " Mr. Grogan said , " remember the way old Davenport used to sing those ballads ? " " Sure , " Spangler said , " as long as this office is here I 'll hear him . I can hear him now . But not old balladsonly  --  church songs , too . Do n't forget the church154 155The Human Comedy Let There Be Lightsongs old Davenport used to sing every Sunday . " " I have n't forgotten them , " Mr. Grogan said . " I remember every one of them . Of course he liked to pretend he was an unbeliever , but all day Sunday he sang hymns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squirting tobacco juice out of his mouth into the spittoon . First thing in the morning he 'd start out with Welcome , delightful morn , thou day of sacred rest . ' He was a great man , Tom . Then he 'd holler out , This is the day of light . Let there be light today . ' " " I remember , " Spangler said , " I remember . Let there be light today . And then he 'd spit tobacco juice into the cuspidor . " " Then , " Mr. Grogan said , " he would sing , Lord , God of morning and of night , We thank Thee for Thy gift of light . ' The great unbeliever  --  and more than anything he loved light and life . And then at the end of the day he would get up from his chair slowly , stretch himself and sing very softly , Now the day is over , night is drawing nigh . ' He knew all of the good old songs , and he loved every one of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unbelieverwho was mocking , Saviour , breathe an eveningblessing , Ere repose our spirits seal ; Sin and want we come confessing , Thou canst save and Thou canst heal . ' " The telegraph operator became silent to remember his friend who had been dead these long , long156years . " It 's the truth , Tom , " he said . " It 's the truth . " The manager of the telegraph office smiled at his old friend and patted him on the shoulder as he moved to turn off the lights and close the office for the night. 157CHAPTER 23DEATH , DO N'T GO TOITHACA ! Homer Macauley was in bed at last , tossing and turning . He dreamed he was running the twotwentylow hurdles again , but every time he got to a hurdle , Byfield was there to stop him . He hurdledanyway and they went down . At every hurdle Byfield was there . Finally the injury to Homer 's leg was so painful that when he tried to run , he fell . He got up and pasted Byfield in the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you ca n't stop me ! You can never stop me  --  low hurdles , high hurdles , any kind of hurdles ! " 158Death , Do n't Go to Ithaca ! He began to run again , limping at first but soon running well , but the next hurdle was inhumanly high  --  eight feet  --  nevertheless , Homer Macauley , perhaps the greatest man in Ithaca , California , went over the hurdle with perfect form . Next in the dream he was in his uniform ridinghis bicycle swiftly down a narrow street . SuddenlyByfield stood in the way . But Homer pushed toward the man more swiftly than ever . " Byfield , " he shouted , " I told you  --  you ca n't stop me ! " He lifted upward on the handlebars of his bicycle , and the bicycle began to rise and fly . It flew directlyover Byfield 's head and came down lightly on the other side of him . But just as it reached the pavement , Byfield stood in the way again ! Again the bicycle left the street and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stayed aloft , suspended twenty feet over Byfield 's head . The man stood in the street , amazed and displeased . " You ca n't do that ! " he shouted at the messenger . " You 're breaking the law of gravity . " " What do I care about the law of gravity ? " Homer shouted down at the man in the street , " or the law of averages , or the law of supply and demand , or any other law ? You ca n't stop me ! You ca n't stop me , that 's all ! Worm , rust and rot  --  I have no time for you . " The messenger rode on through space , leaving the ugly man alone in the street , as inferior as any inferiority could ever be . Now Homer flew high on his bicycle , among dark159The Human Comedy clouds . As the messenger rode through the sky , he watched another bicycle rider in a messenger 's uni- form very much like his own but moving even faster than himself , push out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be Homer himself , but at the same time he seemed to be someone Ho- mer feared . Therefore Homer raced after the second messenger to find out who he really was . The two riders raced a good long distance before Homer began to catch up . Suddenly the other mes- senger turned to look at Homer , and Homer was amazed that the messenger looked exactly like him- self , but at the same time was unmistakably  --  not so much in appearance as in feeling  --  the messenger of Death . The riders were swiftly coming to Ithaca . Homer raced after the messenger of Death , moving swifter than ever before . Far down in the distance he could see the lonely lights of the town and the beautiful lonely streets and houses . Homer was de- termined to head off the other messenger , to keep him away from Ithaca . Nothing in the whole world was more important than to keep this messenger from reaching Ithaca . The two riders raced hard and decently , with no tricks of any kind . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alongside the other rider , and was heading him away from Ithaca . Then , with a sudden burst of speed , the other messenger drew away and turned back toward the little town . Deeply disappointed in himself but still racing with 16o Death , Do n't Go to Ithaca ! all his might , Homer watched the other messengerride on toward Ithaca , leaving Homer far behind . Now Homer could race no longer . There was no energy left with which to chase the messenger of Death . The boy almost collapsed on his bicycle , sobbing bitterly . The bicycle began to fall , and Homerbegan to cry out to the other messenger , " Come back ! Do n't go to Ithaca ! Leave them alone ! Come back ! " The boy sobbed with terrible grief . In the house on Santa Clara Avenue the dreamer 's little brother Ulysses stood beside Homer and listened to him . He went through the dark house to his mother 's bed and shook her . When she sat up , he took her hand and without a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her son a moment , then put Ulysses back in his bed , tucked him in , and sat down beside the weeping boy . She spoke to him very softly . " Be still now , Homer , " she said . " Rest now . You are very tired . You must rest . Sleep now . Sleep peacefully . " The messenger began to stop sobbing and soon his troubled expression went away . " Sleep now , " his mother said to him . " Sleep peacefully . " The boy began to sleep . The mother looked over at her youngest son and he , too , was now asleep . In the corner of the room she saw Matthew Macauley standing , watching , smiling . She got up quietly , took the alarm clock , and went back to her own room. 161The Human ComedyThe messenger 's sleep moved from the realm of terror to one of warmth and light and comfort . Homer Macauley , in this new sleep , found himself lying on his back under a fig tree beside a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his sleep , " would be up by Riverdale where I saw the fig tree by the little stream , with the sun burning with a kind of laughter that made everything else laugh . I remember this place . It was last summer and Marcus and I came here to swim and then we sat on the bank of the stream and talked about what we would do in the world . " And now , knowing the pleasantness of the place he had reached and feeling the warmth of his memory of it , he stretched out comfortably on the grass under the tree  --  and forgot completely that he was asleep . He was in the same old clothes he wore that summerday with Marcus . Before him , stuck into the soft earth , he saw the fishing pole , but this was not from that summer day  --  it was from a long , long time ago . Now , far away through the wilderness of grass and bough Homer Macauley beheld the wondrousHelen Eliot , barefoot like himself , and in a plain gingham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's Helen Eliot , " Homer said to himself . " That 's the girl I love . " He sat up smiling , watched her walk , and then got to his feet and went to greet her . Without a word and with something like solemnity , Homer took the girl 's hand and together they walked to the tree . There he removed162Death , Do n't Go to Ithaca ! his shirt and pants , and swiftly dived into the little stream . The girl went behind a shrub and there she removed her dress . Homer watched her come to the edge of the stream , stand a moment , and then dive . Still solemn , they swam around in the little stream and after a while they left it together to lie on the sand in the sun , and sleep. 163CHAPTER 24THE APRICOT TREEUlysses Macauley was up very early , skipping through the morning 's first sunlight toward the yard of a man who owned a cow . When he reached the yard , Ulysses saw the cow . The small boy stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who owned the cow came out of the small house . He was carrying a bucket and a stool . The man went straight to the cow and began to milk . Ulysses moved in closer until finally he was directly be- hind the man . Still , he could n't see enough , so he knelt down , almost under the cow . The man saw the boy but did not say anything . He went right onThe Apricot Treemilking . The cow , however , turned and looked at Ulysses . Ulysses looked back at the cow . It seemed that the cow did not like to have the boy so close . Ulysses got out from under the cow , walked away , and watched from near by . The cow , in turn , watched Ulysses , so that the small boy believed they were friends . On his way home , Ulysses stopped to watch a man who was building a barn . The man was high-strung , nervous , impatient , and should never have undertakenthe work . He labored furiously , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understand . Ulysses got back to Santa Clara Avenue just in time to see Mr. Arena go off to work on his bicycle . Mary Arena waved to him from the porch and then went back into the house . It was Saturday morning in Ithaca , the school boys ' happiest day . Out of a house not far away came a boy of eight or nine . Ulysses waved to him and the boy waved back . This boy was Lionel Cabot , the neighborhood half-wit , but all the same a great human being , faithful , generous and sweet-tempered . After a moment Lionel looked over at Ulysses again , and , for want of something better to do , waved again . Ulysses waved back . This continued at frequent intervals until August Gottlieb came out of his house next door to Ara 's Market . Auggie had been the leader of the neighborhood boys since Homer Macauley had retired from that164 165The Human Comedy The Apricot Treeposition at the age of twelve . The new leader looked around for his followers . He rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but waved a greetingto each of them nevertheless . He then went out to the middle of the street and whistled , newsboy style . It was a loud whistle , very authoritative , very commanding , and absolutely final . Auggie waited with the confidence of a man who knows what he is doing and what results he is going to get . Immediatelywindows were opened and replies were whistled . Soon a number of boys came running to the corner . In less than three minutes the gang was together  --  AuggieGottlieb , the leader , Nickie Paloota , Alf Rife , and Shag Manoogian . " Where are we going , Auggie ? " Nickie said . " To see if Henderson 's apricots are ripe , " Auggie said . " Can I come , Auggie ? " Lionel said . " O.K. , Lionel , " Auggie said . " If they 're ripe , will you steal some ? " " It 's a sin to steal , " Lionel said . " Not apricots , " Auggie said , making an importantdistinction . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is not for little boys . It 's dangerous . " Ulysses moved away three steps , stopped and watched . He was n't hurt or offended by Auggie 's orders . He understood the code . He was just not old enough yet , that 's all . But while he respected the law , he could n't resist wanting to be in the gang anyhow. 166The boys started off for Henderson 's . Instead of going by way of streets and sidewalks , they took alleys , crossed empty lots , and climbed over fences . They wanted to get there the hard way , the adventurousway . Not far behind , at a safe distance , Ulyssesfollowed . " Ripe apricots are just about the best-tasting fruit in the world , " Auggie said to the members of his gang . " Do apricots get ripe in March ? " Nickie Paloota said . " It 's almost April , " Auggie said . " Early apricots get ripe in no time if the sun shines a lot . " " It 's been raining lately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think apricots get their juice from ? " Auggie said . " From water  --  from rain . Rain is just as important as sunshine to apricots . " " Sunshine in the daytime , rain at night , " Shag Manoogian said . " Warm them up , give them water . I 'll bet there 's a lot of ripe apricots on the tree . " " Boy , I hope so , " Alf Rife said . " It 's too early for apricots , " Nickie Paloota said . " They were n't ripe last year until June . " " That was last year , " Auggie said . " This is this year . " From a distance of about one hundred yards the boys stopped to admire the famous apricot tree  --  all green and pretty , very old and very big . It stood in the corner of Henderson 's backyard . For ten years167The Human Comedy The Apricot Treethe boys of the neighborhood had raided old man Henderson 's apricot tree . In the broken-down house every spring Mr. Henderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys by appearing at the last minute and scaring them away . Now in the house at a curtained window Mr. Henderson looked up from his book . " Well , look at that ! " he said to himself . " Coming to steal apricots in March , in the dead of Winter . Look at them ! " He peeked out at the boys again , whispering as if he were one of them . " Coming to get apricots off old man Henderson 's tree , " he said . " Here they come . Slowly , now . Ha-ha , " he laughed , " look at them ! And look at that little one ! Surely not more than four years old . He 's a new one . Come on , come on ! Come to the wonderful old tree . If I could ripen the apricots for you to steal , I 'd do itMr . Henderson watched the boys as Auggie instructed , directed and led the attack . The boys surroundedthe tree cautiously , fearfully , and with a mingling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apricots were green , they were on Henderson 's tree and belonged to him , and therefore their comingfor the apricots was the same as if the apricots were ripe  --  therefore they hoped the apricots were ripe . But they were afraid , too . They were afraid of Henderson , they were afraid of sin , of capture and guilt , and they were afraid they were a little too168early . They were afraid the apricots were n't ripe yet . " Maybe he ai n't home , Auggie , " Nickie Paloota whispered as the boys almost reached the tree . " He 's home , " Auggie said . " He 's always home . He 's hiding , that 's all . It 's a trap . He wants to catch us . Careful , everybody . There 's no telling where he 'll be . Ulysses , you go home . " Obediently Ulysses retreated three steps and stopped to watch the magnificent duel with the magnificenttree . " Are they ripe , Auggie ? " Shag said . " Do you see any color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's leaves . The apricots are underneath . Easy now , everybody . Where 's Lionel ? " " Here I am , " Lionel whispered . He was terribly afraid . " Well , " Auggie said , " be on your toes . If you see old man Henderson , run ! " " Where is he ? " Lionel said as if Henderson might be invisible or no bigger than a rabbit , something likely to jump up suddenly out of the grass . " What do you mean where is he ? " Auggie said . " He 's in the house , I guess . But you can never tell about Henderson . He might be hiding outside some place , waiting to take us by surprise . " " Are you going to climb the tree , Auggie ? " All Rife said . " Who else ? " Auggie said . " Sure I 'm going to169The Human Comedyclimb the tree , but let 's see if the apricots are ripe first . " " Ripe or green , " Shag Manoogian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , Auggie . " " Do n't worry , " Auggie said . " We will . If they 're ripe , we 'll steal a lot of them . " " What are you going to say at Sunday School tomorrow , Auggie ? " Lionel said . " Stealing apricots is n't stealing , like stealing in the Bible , Lionel , " Auggie said . " This is different . " " Then what are you scared of ? " Lionel said . " Who 's scared ? " Auggie said . " We 've just got to be careful , that 's all . What 's the use getting caught if you can get away ? " " I do n't see any ripe apricots , " Lionel said . " You see a tree , do n't you ? " Auggie said . " I see a tree , all right , " Lionel said . " That 's all , though  --  just a big tree  --  all green . It sure is pretty , too , Auggie . " Now the gang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind . He was absolutely unafraid . He did n't understand at all , but he was sure this was very important stuff  --  something about trees , something about apricots . The boys studied the branches of the old apricot tree , green with fine young leaf . The apricots were all very small , very green , and obviously very hard . " Not ripe yet , " Alf Rife said . " Yeah , " Auggie admitted . " I guess they need a couple days more . Maybe next Saturday . " 170The Apricot Tree " Next Saturday  --  sure , " Shag said . " There 's a lot of them , though , " Auggie said . " We ca n't go back empty-handed , Auggie , " Shag said . " We 've got to get at least one of them  --  green or ripe  --  one of them anyway . " " O.K. , " Auggie said . " I 'll get it . Now the rest of you be ready to run . " Auggie dashed to the tree , swung up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gang and Mr. Henderson and Ulysses watched with fascination , amazement , and admiration . Then Mr. Henderson stepped out of the house onto the back-porch steps . All the boys went off like a school of startled minnows . " Auggie ! " Shag Manoogian shouted . " Hen-derson ! " Like a frightened orang-outang in the jungle , Auggie bounced around in the tree , hung from a branch , and then dropped to the ground . He was running almost before his feet touched the ground , but he noticed Ulysses and stopped suddenly , shoutingat the boy , " Ulysses ! Run  --  run ! " Ulysses , however , did n't budge . He could n't figureit out . Auggie rushed back to the small boy , lifted him off his feet , and ran with him while Hendersonwatched . When all the boys had disappeared and everything was quiet again , the old man smiled and looked up into the tree . Then he turned around and went back into the house. ' 71One by one the members of August Gottlieb 's Secret Society returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of Ara 's Marketto wait there for the arrival of their leader . At last this great man was observed by his devoted followerscoming around the alley holding the hand of Ulysses Macauley . The members of the Society waited silently for the arrival of the leader , who was soon with them . The face of the leader was searched by each of the followers and then the one named Alf Rife said , " Did you get an apricot , Auggie ? " 172Be Happy ! Be Happy ! The leader looked at this faithless one and said , " You do n't have to ask that . You saw me in the tree . You know I got an apricot . " Now all the members spoke in one voice . ( All , that is , excepting Lionel , who was not really a memberat all . ) They said with great admiration , " Let 's see it , Auggie . Let 's look at the apricot . " The little boy Ulysses watched everything , still completely unsure of the mysterious values involved but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely of greater importance than anything else in the world  --  at that moment at least . " Let 's see the apricot you stole , Auggie , " the members of the Society said again . " Come on , let 's see it . " August Gottlieb quietly fished into the pocket of his overalls and brought out a clenched fist which he thrust before him . His followers gathered around and looked directly upon the fist . When everyone was appropriately quiet and respectful , August Gottliebopened his fist . There in the palm of his hand was a small green apricot the size of a quail egg . The followers of the great religious leader smiled at the miraculous object in the palm of his hand , and Lionel  --  the kindest of them all , even though he was not a bona-fide member of the religious sect  --  lifted Ulysses so that he too could see the small green object . Having seen the green apricot , Ulysses173CHAPTER 25BE HAPPY ! BE HAPPY ! The Human Comedysquirmed , got down , and then ran for home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out of his store , stepped Ara himself , the man who had established Ara 's Market in this neighborhoodof Ithaca , California , seven years ago . He was a tall , lean-faced , melancholy and yet comical man in a white grocer 's apron . He stood a moment on the small porch of the store to look down at the new Messiah and his disciples and to listen to their delighted expressions of adoration for the Holy Image . " Auggie , you ! " he said . " You , Shag ! Nickie ! Alfo , you ! Lionel , you !  --  what you call this ? United States Congress Washington ? Go some odder place hold important meeting . This market , not Congress . " " Oh , sure , Mr. Ara , " August Gottlieb said . " We 'll go across the street to the empty lot . Do you want to see an apricot ? " " You got apricot ? " the grocer said . " Where you get apricot ? " " Off a tree , " Auggie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not apricot now , " the grocer said . " Apricot come in two more month . In Maytime . " " This is a March apricot , " August Gottlieb , the leader of the whirling-dervishes , said to the grocer . " Here , " he said , " look at it . " Again he opened his fist , revealing the small hard green object . " Look at it , Mr. Ara , " Auggie said , and then paused . " Pretty ? " " All right , all right , " Mr. Ara said . " Pretty . Very174Be Happy ! Be Happy ! fine apricot . Now go hold meeting United States Congress Washington some odder place . Today Saturday . Market open for business . Do n't crowd small store first thing in morning . Give chance . Small store get scared , run away . " " O.K. , Mr. Ara , " Auggie said , " we wo n't crowd your store . We 'll go across the street now . Come on , you guys . " Mr. Ara studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go back into the store when a small boy who resembled him came out of the store and stood beside him . " Papa ? " the small boy said . " Hah , John ? " the father said to his son , speaking in their own language . " Give me apple , " the son said to the father . He spoke earnestly , almost sadly . The father took the son by the hand and together they went into the store to the counter where the fresh fruit was stacked in piles . " Apple ? " the father said to the boy . He took an apple from the pile  --  the very best apple in the pile  --  and handed it to the boy . " All right , " he said  --  " apple . " The father went behind the counter of his store to wait for a customer , and in the meantime to look upon his son , surely as melancholy as himself , even though there was a difference of at least forty years in their ages . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it slowly , swallowed it , and then175The Human Comedyfor a moment seemed to think about it , while the father himself thought about it too . The apple did not make the boy happy . He put it down on the counter in front of his father and then looked up at the man . There they were , in Ithaca , California , probably seven thousand miles from what had been for centuries their home in the world . Naturally there was a loneliness in each of them , but no one could know for sure that the same loneliness might not be in them had they been seven thousand miles away , back home . There on the floor of his store stood the father 's son , and the father looked at the son  --  at his own face in the boy , his own eyes , and beyond the eyes surely his own unhappiness . There was the same man , only younger . The father took the rejected apple , attacked it with an enormous bite , making a crackling sound , and stood chewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftness and noisiness of his chewing . An apple was too good a thing in the world to be wasted , and therefore if his son would not eat it , then he must eat it , even though he had no passion for apples or for their flavor . He simply knew that it was wrong to waste anything . He continued to bite into the apple , to chew , and to swallow . At last , however , it was a little too much  --  there was a little too much apple . It would be necessary to waste some of it . With recklessness and perhaps a small amount of regret , he threw the remains of the apple into the garbage can. 176Now the son spoke again . " Papa ? " he said . " Hah , John ? " the father said . " Give me orange , " the boy said . The father selected the biggest orange in the neat pile of oranges and handed it to the boy . " Orange ? " he said . " All right  --  orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange , then began to finish the job of peeling with his fingers , working slowly but efficiently at first but after a momentaccelerating his effort with such an intensity that even the father began to feel , as surely the son felt , that beneath the peeling of this growth of tree would be not simply an orange but the heart 's final happiness . The boy placed the peelings of the orange on the counter in front of his father , broke the orange in half , peeled off one section , put it in his mouth , chewed , and swallowed . But alas , no . It was truly an orange , but it was truly not the heart 's final happiness . The son waited a moment , then put the rest of the orange in front of his father . Again the father took up the unfinished work and silently began trying to finish it . But soon the limit was reached , and a little less than half of the orange went into the garbage can . " Papa ? " the boy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hah , John ? " " Give me candy , " the boy said . " Candy ? " the father said . " All right  --  candy . " From the candy showcase the father selected the most popular five-cent bar of candy and handed it177The Human Comedy to the boy . The boy studied this manufactured sub- stance , removed the wax paper , took a big bite out of the chocolate-covered candy and again slowly chewed and swallowed . But again it was nothing  --  only candy  --  sweet , yes ; otherwise , nothing , nothing . Once again the son returned to the father another substance of the world which had failed to bring him happiness . Patiently the father accepted the respon- sibility  --  to avoid waste . He picked up the candy bar , started to bite into it and then changed his mind . He turned and threw the candy into the garbage can . For some reason he felt bitterly angry , and in his heart he cursed some people seven thousand miles away who had once seemed to him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs ! he said in his heart . Once again the boy spoke to his father . " Papa ? " he said . " Hah , John ? " the father said . " Give me banana , " the boy said . The father sighed this time but did not abandon all faith . " Banana ? " he said . " All right  --  banana . " He examined the bunch of bananas hanging over the piles of fruit and finally discovered what he be- lieved to be the very best  --  the ripest and the sweet- est banana of the bunch . He plucked this banana off the bunch and handed it to the boy . At last a customer came into the store . The cus- tomer was a man Mr. Ara had never seen before  --  a stranger . The storekeeper and the customer nodded 178 A , ll U //J V. 11 t  --  AUA/ Jy. slightly to one another in greeting , and then the man said , " You got cookies ? " " Cook-ies ? " the grocer said eagerly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into the store . This customerwas Ulysses Macauley . He stood to one side , listening and watching , waiting his turn . " You got cookies , raisins in ? " the man said to the grocer . " Cook-ies , raisins in ? " the grocer said . This was a problem . " Cook-ies , raisins in , " the grocer said again , almost whispering . " Cook-ies , raisins in , " he said still again . The grocer looked around the store . The grocer 's son put the banana on the counter in front of his father  --  rejected . " Papa ? " the boy said . The father looked at the boy and then spoke very swiftly . " You want apple , " he said . " I give you apple . You want orange . I give you orange . You want candy . I give you candy . You want banana . I give you banana . What you want now ? " " Cookies , " the boy said . " What kind cook-ies you want ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the customer , and in fact , speaking to the customer , but at the same time speaking to his son , and at the same time speaking to everybody  --  everybody , everywhere  --  everybody wanting things . " Cookies , raisins in , " the boy said . With furious restraint the father almost whispered179The Human Comedyhis reply to his son , but instead of looking at his son he looked at the customer . " I got no cook-ies , " he whispered . " No kind cook-ies . What you want cook-ies ? I got everything , but no cook-ies . What 's cook-ies ? What you want ? " " Cookies , " the man said patiently , " for small boy . " " I got no cook-ies , " the grocer said again . " I got small boy too . " The grocer pointed to his own son . " I give him apple , orange , candy , banana , lots of good things . " He looked the customer straight in the eye , and almost as if he were angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My broder 's boy , " the customer said . " He 's got influenza . He cry  --  he want cookies . Cookies , raisins in , ' he say . " But every man lives his own life and every life has its own theme , so that again the grocer 's son looked at his father and said , " Papa ? " But now the father refused to look at the boy . Instead he looked at the man whose nephew was ill and wanted cookies with raisins in them . He looked at the man with understanding , with sympathy , and yet with a kind of peasant rage , not against the man but against the world itself , against disease , against pain , against loneliness , against the heart wanting what it can never have . The grocer was angry at himself too because even though he had established this market in Ithaca , California , seven thousand miles from home , he did not have cookies with rai-ISOBe Happy ! Be Happy ! sins in them , he did not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his son and spoke to the man . " Apple , " the grocer said , " orange , candy , banana  --  no cookies . He 's my boy . Three year old . Not sick . He want many things . He want apple . He want orange . He want candy . He want banana . I do n't know what he want . Nobody know what he want . He just want . He look at God . He say , Give me dis , give me dat  --  but he never satisfied . Always he want . Always he 's feel bad . Poor God has got nothing for sadness . He give everything  --  world  --  sunshine  --  moder  --  fader  --  broder  --  sister  --  onkle  --  cousin  --  house , farm , stove , table , bed  --  poor God give everything  --  butnobody happy  --  everybody like small boy sick with influenza  --  everybody say give me cookies  --  raisins in . " The grocer stopped a moment to take a very deep breath . When he exhaled he said very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raisins in . " The grocer began to move with an impatience and a fury which were almost majestic . First he took a paper bag and snapped it open . Then he began to toss things into the bag . " Here 's orange , " he said , " very pretty . Here 's apple . Wonderful . Here 's banana . Taste very good . " Now , gently , and with great courtesy and sincere sympathy for the man and for the man 's sick nephew , the grocer handed the bag to the customer . " Take to little boy , " he said . " Maybe he not cry . Here , take good things to little boy. 181The Human ComedyDo n't pay . I no want money . " And then again he said very softly , " Is no cookies , raisins in . " " He cry , " the man said . " He feel very bad . He say , Cookies , raisins in . ' Thank you very much , but we give small boy apple , orange , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the counter . " Sick boy say , " he said to the grocer , Give me cookies , raisins in . ' Apple , orange  --  no good . Cookies . Excuse me , " the man said . " I go try chain store . Maybe they got cookies , raisins in . " " All right , my friend , " the grocer whispered . " All right . You go try chain store  --  but they no got cookies , raisins in . Nobody got . " Almost shyly the stranger left the store . For a full minute the grocer stood behind the counter of his store staring at his son . Suddenly he began to speak in his own language , Armenian . " The world 's gone mad , " he said to the small boy . " In Russia alone , so near our own country , our own beautiful little nation , millions of people , millions of children , every day go hungry . They are cold , pathetic , barefooted  --  They walk around  --  no place to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere to lie down and rest  --  one night of peaceful sleep . And what about us ? What do we do ? Here in Ithaca , California , in this great country , America . What do we do ? We wear good clothes . We put on good shoes every morning when we get up from sleep . We walk around with no one in the streets to come with guns or to burn our houses or to murder182Be Happy ! Be Happy ! our children or brothers or fathers . We take rides out into the beautiful country in automobiles . We eat the best food . Every night when we go to bed we sleep  --  and then what are we ? We are discontented . We are still discontented . " The grocer shouted this amazing truth at his little son with terrible love for the boy . " Apple , " he said , " orange , candy , banana , for God 's sake , little fellow , do n't do this ! If I do it , you are my son , better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be happy ! Be happy ! I am unhappy , but you must be happy . " He pointed to the back door of the store which led into the house , and obediently , very sober-faced , the little boy left the store and entered the house . Now the grocer spent a moment trying to composehimself . At last he believed he was calm enough to speak quietly to the customer in the store , Ulysses Macauley . He turned to the boy and tried to be cheerful . He even smiled . " What you want , little boy Ulysses ? " he said . " Mush , " Ulysses said . " What kind mush you want ? " the grocer said . " H-O , " Ulysses said . " Two kinds H-O , little boy Ulysses , " the grocer said  --  " regular kind , quick-cooking kind . Two kinds . Slow , quick . Old , new . What kind your mama want , little boy Ulysses ? " Ulysses thought about this a moment and thensaid , " H-O . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . X831The Human ComedyBut the little boy did n't know , so the grocer decidedfor him . " All right , " he said , " new kind , modem . Eighteen cents , please , little boy Ulysses . " Ulysses opened his fist and thrust his arm out toward the grocer , who took the quarter from the boy 's hand . The grocer handed Ulysses the change , saying , " Eighteen cents , nineteen , twenty , and nickel  --  twenty-five . Thank you , little boy Ulysses . " " Yes , sir , " Ulysses said . He took the package of oatmeal and walked out of the store . It was very difficult to understand anything . First it was apricots on a tree , then it was cookies with raisins in , and then it was the grocer talking to his son in a strange tongue  --  but even so it was wonderful . In the street the little boy kicked up his foot as he did whenever he was pleased , and began to run home with the package from the grocer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the kitchen table set for one , waiting for her son Homer to come to breakfast . She was setting down a bowl of oatmeal when he came into the kitchen . Her glance at him was only fleeting but even so she knew that the strange experience of his dream last night was still upon him . Even though he himself did not know he had wept in his sleep , his spirit seemed hushed as the spirit of a man is hushed after grief . Even his voice seemed deeper and gentler . " I did n't want to sleep this late , " he said . " It 's ' 84 185The Human Comedy There Will Always Be Pain in Thingsalmost nine-thirty . What happened to the alarm clock ? " " You 're working hard , " Mrs. Macauley said . " You must rest too . " " I 'm not working so hard , " Homer said . " Besides , tomorrow 's Sunday . " He said his morning prayer , only it seemed to last twice as long as usual . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat when he stopped and studied the spoon strangely . He looked toward his mother who was busy at the kitchen sink . " Ma ? " he said . " Yes , Homer ? " Mrs. Macauley said without turning . " I did n't talk to you last night when I came home from work , " he said , " because it was like you said . I could n't talk . All of a sudden on the way home last night I started to cry . You know I never did cry when I was little or at school when I was in trouble . I always felt ashamed to cry . Even Ulysses never cries because  --  well , what 's the use crying ? But last night I just could n't help it . I cried , but I do n't remember if I was ashamed even . I do n't think I was . After I started to cry I could n't come straight home . I rode out to Ithaca Wine and then , because I was still crying , I rode across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I rode past a house where some people had been having a party earlier in the evening  --  the house was dark now . I took those people a telegram . You know the kind of telegram it was . Then I went back to town and rode all186around the streets looking at everything  --  all the buildings , all the places I 've known all my life , all of them full of people . And then I really saw Ithaca and I really knew the people who lived in Ithaca , all of them good people . I felt sorry for all of them and I even prayed that nothing would happen to them . After that I stopped crying . I thought a fellow would never cry when he got to be grown up , but it seems that 's when a fellow starts , because that 's when a fellow starts finding out about things . " He stopped a moment and then his voice became even more somber than it had been . " Almost everything a man finds out is bad or sad , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word from his mother but she did not speak and did not turn away from her work . " Why is that so ? " he said . Mrs. Macauley began to speak , but she did not turn to him . " You will find out , " she said . " No one can tell you . Each man finds out in his own way . If it 's sad , nobly or foolishly , the man himself will make it so . If it 's richly sad and full of beauty , it 's the man himself so , and not the things around him . And so it is , if it 's bad , or ugly , or pathetic  --  it is al- ways the man himself , and each man is the world . Each man is the whole world , to make over as he will and to fill with a human race he can love , if it is love he has , or a race he must hate , if it is hate he has . The world waits to be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made over every morning187The Human Comedylike a bed or a household where the same people live  --  always the same , but always changing too . " The mother was now busy on the back porch , and even though she was out of sight her son continued to speak with her . " Why did I cry on the way home last night ? " he said . " I have never felt the way I felt then . I do n't understand it . And after I stopped crying why could n't I talk ? Why was there nothing for me to say  --  to you or to myself ? " From the porch Mrs. Macauley spoke very clearly so that he heard every word unmistakably . " It was pity that made you cry , " she said . " Pity , not for this person or that person who is suffering , but for all things  --  for the very nature of things . Unless a man has pity he is inhuman and not yet truly a man , for out of pity comes the balm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man has not wept at the world 's pain he is less than the dirt he walks upon because dirt will nourish seed , root , stalk , leaf and flower , but the spirit of a man without pity is barren and will bring forth nothing  --  or only pride which must finally do murder of one sort or another  --  murder of good things , or murder even of human lives . " Now Mrs. Macauley returned to the sink of the kitchen where she began new work  --  work which even Homer knew was unnecessary . " There will always be pain in things , " Mrs. Macauleysaid . " Knowing this does not mean that a man shall despair . The good man will seek to takeThere Will Always Be Pain in Thingspain out of things . The foolish man will not even notice it except in himself . And the evil man will drive pain deeper into things and spread it about wherever he goes . But each man is guiltless , for the evil man no less than the foolish man or the good man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , from nothing , but from many worlds and from multitudes . The evil do not know they are evil and are therefore innocent . The evil man must be forgiven every day . He must be loved , because somethingof each of us is in the most evil man in the world and something of him is in each of us . He is ours and we are his . None of us is separate from any other . The peasant 's prayer is my prayer , the assassin'scrime is my crime . Last night you cried because you began to know these things . " Homer Macauley poured milk over the oatmeal in the bowl and began to eat his breakfast . Suddenlyhe felt it was all right to eat. 188 189CHAPTER 27ALL THE WONDERFULMISTAKESUlysses Macauley and his best friend in the world , Lionel Cabot  --  the great Lionel  --  came into the Macauleykitchen .

She filled a glass of water for the boy , and he drank it all down thirstily , making the kind of sound that boys make when water is still the most wonderful drink in the world . Lionel turned to his friend . " Do n't you want a drink of water , too , Ulysses ? " he said . Ulysses indicated by nodding that he would like a glass of water , so Mrs. Macauley gave him a glass , too . After he had swallowed the water , Lionel said , " Well , I guess we 'll go to the pubalic liberry now , Mrs. Macauley . " The two friends walked out of the house . Homer Macauley , eating his breakfast , had watched his little brother . When the two boys were gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ulysses when he was little ? " " How do you mean ? " Mrs. Macauley said . " You know , " Homer said , " the way Ulysses is  --  interested in everything , always watching . Does n't ever say anything but always gets a kick out of everything . Seems to like everybody and everybody seems to like him . He does n't know many words . He ca n't read , but you can almost always understand him by just looking at him . You can almost even understand192what he 's telling you even if he does n't say a word . Was Marcus like that too ? " " Well , " Mrs. Macauley said , " Marcus and Ulysses are brothers , so of course Ulysses is something like Marcus , but they 're not exactly alike . " " Ulysses is going to be a great man some day , is n't he , Ma ? " Homer said . " No . " Mrs. Macauley smiled . " No , I do n't think so  --  not in the eyes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be great of course , because he 's great now . " " Marcus was great when he was little too , was n't he ? " Homer said . " You 've all a lot in common , of course , " Mrs. Macauleysaid , " but not too much . Marcus was not restless as you are . He was restless , of course , but in his own way . He was shy and would rather be alone than out looking for people to see , like Ulysses . Marcus liked to read and listen to music and just sit around or go for long walks . " " Well , " Homer said , " Ulysses sure likes Marcus . " " Ulysses likes everybody , " Mrs. Macauley said . " He likes everybody in the world . " " Sure , " Homer said , " but he likes Marcus especially , and I know why , too , because Marcus is still a child , even if he is in the Army . I guess a child looks for a child in everyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody grown up , I guess he likes that person more than the others . I wish I could begin to be grown up the way Ulysses is a child . I guess I admire him more than anybody else in the193The Human Comedy All the Wonderful Mistakesworld outside of our family . Did he tell you what happened to him yesterday ? " " He did n't say a word about it , " Mrs. Macauley said . " Auggie came and told us . " " Well , " Homer said , " what did he say when he came into the house after I brought him home from the telegraph office ? " " He did n't say anything , " Mrs. Macauley said . " He just sat down , listened to the music , and then we had supper . When I put him to bed he said , Big Chris . ' That 's all , and went to sleep . I had no idea who Big Chris was until Auggie told me . " " Big Chris got Ulysses out of the trap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty dollars for the crazy invention , because it was ruined . It 's supposed to be a trap , but I do n't think it is . I do n't think it could catch anybody or any thing in the world except Ulysses . No animal would move into something complicated like that . Who is Ulysses like  --  most of all ? " Homer said . " He is like his father , " Mrs. Macauley said . " Did you know Papa when he was little ? " Homer said . " Lord , no ! " Mrs. Macauley said . " How could I ? Your father was seven years older than me . Ulysses is like your father as your father was all his life . " Suddenly Mrs. Macauley was filled with an overflowingfeeling of happiness in spite of anything that had ever been , or anything that ever could be . " Oh , I 've had good luck , " she said , " and I 'm thankful . Mychildren are human beings , besides being children . They might have been children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so good . Last night you cried because you are human , because you are one of millions in the world , because the full adventure of living has started for you  --  in a world chock full of things that are n't easy to understand  --  some good , some bad , some beautiful , some ugly , some generous , and some cruel , but all of them together , one thing : the world and the life of men in it . " She stopped a moment to look at her son . Then she said very softly , " You cried in your sleep last night , too . " " Did I ? " Homer said . He was amazed not to have known . " Yes , " Mrs. Macauley said . " Your crying wakened Ulysses , and he came and wakened me . I heard you crying , but it was not really you . " " What do you mean ? " Homer said . " I know that sobbing , " Mrs. Macauley said . " I have heard it before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's . It is the whole world 's . Having known the world 's grief , you are now on your way , so of course all the mistakes are ahead  --  all the wonderful mistakesthat you must and will make . I will tell you at breakfast in broad daylight what any of us might hesitate to say in the comforting darkness of night , because you are still fresh from that sleep and grief and because I must tell you . No matter what the mistakesare that you must make , do not be afraid of having made them or of making more of them . The Human ComedyTrust your heart , which is a good one , to be right , and go ahead  --  do n't stop . If you fall , tricked or tripped by others , or by yourself even , get up and do n't turn back . Many times you will laugh and many times you will weep , but always you will laugh and weep together . You will never have a moment of time in your life to be mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  too small for the swiftness of your spirit  --  too insignificant to come into the line of your vision . " Mrs. Macauley smiled and stood beside her son , feeling a little awkward and embarrassed . " I 'm sorry , " she said , " that I must always , nighttime and daytime , tell you the things I know every man wants to tell himself , but I know you will forgive me . " The only thing Homer could say to this was , " Ah , Ma . " He got up from the table as he spoke and limped to the window . There he looked out at the empty lot , at August Gottlieb and his pals who were in the midst of a game of football . " What 's the matter with your leg ? " Mrs. Macauleysaid . " Nothing , " Homer said . " I took a little spill . " Without turning to her , he went on . " You know , Ma , I guess you 're just about the most wonderful person anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something he saw in the football game . " There goes Auggie to another touchdown , " he said . " No more games for me , " he went on . " I 'm going to the telegraph office . I told them I would come196All the Wonderful Mistakesdown just in case they need me . " He turned to go , then stopped . " Oh , yes , Ma , " he said , " I almost forgot . Mr. Grogan  --  you know , the night telegraph operator  --  well , he ate one of the sandwiches you sent yesterday with Bess . He told me to thank you . So thanks , Ma , for Mr. Grogan . " Homer left the house . His mother heard him bounce his bike several times to see if there was enough air in the tires , and then she saw him ride around the house headed for the telegraph office . She turned now to his chair at the table and there she saw Matthew Macauley . He was studying the spoon just as his son Homer had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Katey ? " he said . " Yes , Matthew ? " Katey said . " Katey , " Matthew said , " Marcus is going to come with me . " There was a pause . " I know , Matthew , " Katey said , and then she turned to her work. 197CHAPTER 28AT THE PUBLIC LIBRARYThe good friends , Lionel and Ulysses , walked toward the public library . A block before them a funeral procession emerged from the First Ithaca Presbyterian Church . Pallbearers carried a plain casket to an old Packard hearse . Following the casketthe two boys saw a handful of mourners . " Come on , Ulysses , " Lionel said , " it 's a funeral ! Somebody 's dead . " They ran , Lionel holding Ulysses by the hand , and very soon they were at the center of everything . " That 's the casket , " Lionel whispered . " Somebody'sdead in there . I wish I knew who it is . SeeAt the Public Librarythe flowers . They give them flowers when they die . See them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lionel turned to a man who was n't very busy crying . The man had just blown his nose and touched his handkerchief to the corners of his eyes . " Who 's dead ? " Lionel asked the man . " It 's poor little Johnny Merryweather , the hunchback , " the man said . Lionel turned to Ulysses . " It 's poor little Johnny Merryweather , the hunchback , " Lionel said . " Seventy years old , " the man said . " Seventy years old , " Lionel said to Ulysses . " Sold popcorn on the corner of Mariposa and Broadway for thirty years , " the man said . " Sold popcorn on the corner of  --  " Lionel stopped suddenly and looked at the man . He almost shouted . " You mean the popcorn man ? " Lionel said . " Yes , " the man said , " Johnny Merryweathergoneto his rest . " " I knew him ! " Lionel shouted . " I bought popcornoff of him many times ! Did he die ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Died in his sleep . Gone to his Maker . " " I knew Johnny Merryweather ! " Lionel said , almostcrying . " I did n't know his name was Johnny Merryweather , but I knew him . " Lionel turned to Ulysses and put his arm around his friend . " It 's Johnny , " he almost wept . " Johnny198 I 199The Human Comedy At the Public LibraryMerryweather , gone to his Maker . One of my best friends , gone to his rest . " The hearse drove away and very soon there was no one in front of the church except Lionel and Ulysses . Somehow it seemed wrong for Lionel to leave the place where he learned that the man who had died , the man in the casket , was a man he knew , even though he had never known that the man 's name was Johnny Merryweather . At last , however , he decided that he could n't stand in front of the church forever , even if he had bought popcorn off of Johnny Merryweather many times  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , he went on down the street with his friend Ulysses , still headed for the public library . When the two boys entered this humble but impressivebuilding , they entered an area of profound and almost frightening silence . It seemed as if even the walls had become speechless , and the floor and the tables , as if silence had engulfed everything in the building . There were old men reading newspapers . There were town philosophers . There were high school boys and girls doing research , but everyone was hushed , because they were seeking wisdom . They were near books . They were trying to find out . Lionel not only whispered , he moved on tiptoe . Lionel whispered because he was under the impression that it was out of respect for books , not considerationfor readers . Ulysses followed him , also on tiptoe , and they explored the library , each finding200many treasures , Lionel  --  books , and Ulysses  --  people . Lionel did n't read books and he had n't come to the public library to get any for himself . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He pointed out a whole row of shelved books to his friend and then he whispered , " All of these  --  and these . And these . Here 's a red one . All these . There 's a green one . All these . " Finally Mrs. Gallagher , the old librarian , noticed the two boys and went over to them . She did n't whisper , however . She spoke right out , as if she were not in the public library at all . This shocked Lionel and made a few people look up from the pages of their books . " What are you looking for , boy ? " Mrs. Gallagher said to Lionel . " Books , " Lionel whispered softly . " What books are you looking for ? " the librarian said . " All of them , " Lionel said . " All of them ? " the librarian said . " What do you mean ? You ca n't borrow more than four books on one card . " " I do n't want to borrow any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world do you want with them ? " the librarian said . " I just want to look at them , " Lionel said . " Look at them ? " the librarian said . " That is not201The Human Comedy At the Public Librarywhat the public library is for . You can look into them , you can look at the pictures in them , but what in the world do you want to look at the outsidesof them for ? " " I like to , " Lionel whispered . " Ca n't I ? " " Well , " the librarian said , " there 's no law against it . " She looked at Ulysses . " And who 's this ? " she said . " This here 's Ulysses , " Lionel said . " He ca n't read . " " Can you ? " the librarian said to Lionel . " No , " Lionel said , " but he ca n't either . That 's why we 're friends . He 's the only other man I know who ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two friends a moment and in her mind said something which very nearly approached a kind of delicious cursing . This was something brand new in all the years of her experienceat the public library . " Well , " she said at last , " perhaps it 's just as well that you ca n't read . I can read . I have been reading books for the past sixty years , and I ca n't see as how it 's made any great difference . Run along now and look at the books as you please . " " Yes , ma'am , " Lionel said . The two friends moved off into still greater realms of mystery and adventure . Lionel pointed out more books to Ulysses . " These , " he said . " And those over there . And these . All books , Ulysses . " He stopped a202moment to think . " I wonder what they say in all these books . " He pointed out a whole vast area of them , five shelves full of them . " All these , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Finally he discovered a book that looked very pretty from the outside . Its cover was green , like fresh grass . " And this one , " he said , " this one is pretty , Ulysses . " A little frightened at what he was doing , Lionel lifted the book out of the shelf , held it in his hands a moment and then opened it . " There , Ulysses ! " he said . " A book ! There it is ! See ? They 're saying something in here . " Now he pointed to something in the print of the book . " There 's an A , ' " he said . " That 's an A ' right there . There 's another letter of some sort . I do n't know what that one is . Every letter 's different , Ulysses , and every word 's different . " He sighed and looked around at all the books . " I do n't think I 'll ever learn to read , " he said , " but I sure would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now here 's a picture , " he said . " Here 's a picture of a girl . See her ? Pretty , is n't she ? " he turned many pages of the book and said , " See it ? More letters and words , straight through to the end of the book . This is the pubalic liberry , Ulysses , " he said . " Books all over the place . " He looked at the print of the book with a kind of reverence , whispering to himself as if he were trying to read . Then he shook his head . " You ca n't know what a book says , Ulysses , unless you can read , and I ca n't read , " he said. 2 03The Human ComedyHe closed the book slowly , put it back in its place , and together the two friends tiptoed out of the library . Outside , Ulysses kicked up his heel because he felt good , and because it seemed he had learned something new . AT THE PARLOR LECTURECLUBHomer Macauley got off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white building which was an architectural cross between a Colonial house and a New England church . It was now twothirtyin the afternoon and this Saturday afternoon'slecture was about to begin . Consequently , wonderful , plump , vague , middle-aged ladies , most of them mothers , were cheerfully entering the building . The messenger took a telegram out of his hat and studied it . The telegram was addressed to205The Human ComedyRosalie Simms-Peabody , Ithaca Parlor Lecture Club , Ithaca , California . Deliver in person . As the messenger walked into the hall , the Presidentof the Club , a sweet and roundish lady in her early fifties , was beginning to introduce the lecturer , who was nowhere to be seen . The President of the Club pounded a small walnut-breaker on the table and the audience in the hall began to quiet down . Homer Macauley , however , could not help making a small amount of noise by seeking Rosalie SimmsPeabody . Therefore , a sweetly smiling lady of perhapsone hundred and sixty pounds shushed him . " I 've got a telegram for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be delivered to her per-sonally . " " Rosalie Simms-Pibity , " the lady corrected the messenger . " Yes , Rosalie Simms-Pibity is expecting the telegram . You are to deliver it to her on the platform when she appears . " " When is that going to be ? " Homer said . " In a moment now , " the lady said . " Just sit down and wait . When Rosalie Simms-Pibity appears , run right up onto the stage and call out very clearly , Telegram for Rosalie Simms-Pibity ! ' Not Peabody , boy . " Yes , ma'am , " Homer said . The messenger sat down and the lady tiptoed away , smiling proudly at the important work she had done . " Members of the Ithaca Parlor Lecture Club , " the President of the Club began to say . " This after-206At the Parlor Lecture Clubnoon , " she continued , " we have in store a great treat . Our speaker is to be Rosalie Simms-Pibity . " The President of the Club paused after the announcement of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After the applause , she continued . " I do not have to tell you who Rosalie Simms-Pibity is , " she said . " She is internationally famous  --  one of the great women of our time . We all know her name and we all know she is famous . But do we , I wonder , know why she is famous . " The President of the Club answered this question . " I am afraid not , " she said . And then after a moment of looking about at her friends in the audience , the women of Ithaca , California , she began the fable of this great person . " The story of Rosalie Simms-Pibity , " the President of the Club said , as if she were telling a fable not the least unlike , or not one bit less majestic than the fable of the Odyssey itself , " is a story especially thrilling to women . Simms-Pibity  --  for that is how she prefers to be known  --  has lived a life brimming over with adventure , romance , danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a dashing handsome British girl  --  at the same time a girl hard as steel and stronger than most men . In fact , there are few men who have lived a life as adventurous as the life of Simms-Pibity . " Now a note of tender sadness came into the voice of the President of the Ithaca Parlor Lecture Club as she continued the legend of the great female hero . " As for us , " she said somberly , " the stay-at-207The Human Comedy At the Parlor Lecture Clubhomes , the mothers , the bringer-uppers , so to speak , of children , the life of Simms-Pibity is like a dream  --  our dream  --  the unfulfilled dream of each of us who have only stayed at home , given birth to our children , and looked after our houses . Hers is the beautifullife each of us would have liked to have lived if we had dared , but Fate , as it will , has not decreed such adventures for us , and in all the world there is only one Simms-Pibity . Only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look over the faces of her old friends in the audience . " What is it , " she said , " that Simms-Pibity has done which has made her so rare among women ? Well , " she went on , " the list of her adventures is staggering , and as I read the list to you , you will scarcely be able to believe any woman could do such things and still be alive , but alive she is , and here to talk to us . Simms-Pibity is going to talk to us in plain language  --  language perhaps , to some of us , shocking . But first let me go over the adventures  --  only briefly  --  for a full recitation of them would take all day and perhaps all night , as every day is a new adventurefor Simms-Pibity . She creates adventure wherever she goes , and we may be sure that before she leaves our unknown little city , Ithaca , she will have discovered here things we ourselves do not know . But on to the adventures . " From 1915 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other war . During 1917 and 1918 she went around the world with anothergirl  --  on tramp steamers , cattle boats , walking and riding and living in many strange places  --  sometimes even in native huts . She visited twenty-seven differentcountries . She was captured by the Southern Army in China as she tried to go overland by river junk and sedan chair from Canton to Hankow . " The President of the Club paused a moment to dwell on the magical words , and then repeated them , almost whispering . " Canton and Hankow . Simms-Pibity escaped her capturers by shooting the falls of the Sian River in the wet season when no other boat would go out on them . " In 1919 she went across North Africa from Morocco to Abyssinia . In 1920 she was employed in Syria in the secret service . In Damascus she met King Feisal , who helped her make the exploration of Kufara , never before visited by white people , the secret and sacred capital of the fanatic Senussi Sect , deep in the heart of the Libyan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles on camel-back , her only companions coarse , native men who could speak no English . " The President of the Ithaca Parlor Lecture Club lifted her eyes after this remark and looked over at two of her most intimate friends . Homer Macauley wondered what she meant by that glance and then wondered how long she was going to talk about this incredible and wonderful person , Rosalie SimmsPibity . " During 1923 , " the speaker continued , " Simms-208 209The Human ComedyPibity sailed a twenty-ton dhow with an Arab crew fourteen days down the Red Sea to land at the forbiddenport of Jeizan . This time she was disguised as an Arab woman . In 1925 she climbed the Atlas Mountains of Morocco . In 1926 she walked one thousand one hundred miles through Abyssinia  --  perhaps a world record . " And then with terrible scorn for herself and her friends in Ithaca , the President of the Ithaca Parlor Lecture Club said , " Do we , I wonder , ever walk with pleasure even so short a distance as the distance from Gottschalk 's to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to answer this question , she offered , " It might perhapsdo us good . " She returned to the matter of introducing the lecturer of the day , looking for her place in the booklet of notes she held in her hand . " To continue , " she said . " In 1928 Simms-Pibity covered the Balkans for a London newspaper , disguisednow as a native woman of one country , now as a native woman of another . " Getting bored , waiting impatiently , eager to get back to the telegraph office and his work , Homer Macauley wondered , " Why is she always disguising herself ? " The President of the Ithaca Parlor Lecture Club went on with her introduction . " In 1930 , " she said , " Simms-Pibity made an exciting journey through Turkey and met Mustapha Kemal , a Turk . There Simms-Pibity was disguised as a young Turkish girl from the hill country . She traveled over nine thous-210At the Parlor Lecture Cluband miles on horseback , moving all through the Near East . In Azerbaijan she saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1931 she traveled through South America , exploring the jungles of Brazil with only native men for companions , one of whom was named , I understand  --  from Simms-Pibity herself  --  Max . " The President of the Ithaca Parlor Lecture Club was now close to the end of her speech of introduction . She sighed and said , " But the adventures of SimmsPibityare endless , and it is her you wish to see and hear , not me . " This sweet modesty brought a nervousgiggle out of the wonderful President of the wonderful Club , and then a kind of sympathetic but hearty laughter from her friends in the audience . When a proper quietude had come over the audience , the President said in a firm and dramatic voice , " It gives me great pride , as President of the Ithaca Parlor Lecture Club , to present to you  --  RosalieSimms-Pibity ! " The applause this time was almost an ovation . The President of the Club turned toward the wings of the stage to greet the distinguished visitor , but alas , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking advantage of this delay , increased its applause and after perhaps two full minutes of clapping  --  duringwhich a number of women actually confessed that their hands were getting sore  --  the great lady finally presented herself. 211The Human ComedyHomer Macauley expected to see somebody unlikeany woman he had ever seen before in his life . He could n't imagine exactly what form this creature would take , but he felt certain that it would be surely at least interesting  --  and so it was . Rosalie Simms-Pibity was , briefly , an old battle-ax , horsefaced , sex-starved , dried-out , tall , skinny , gaunt , bony , absurd , and a mess . Because the time had come for Homer to deliver the telegram , he got to his feet , but he was not sure he did n't get to his feet because he was amazed , and it was strange that he did not run up onto the stage and deliver the telegram , as he had been instructed to do . Now the nice lady who had given him his instructionscame rushing over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aisle and whispering loud enough for everyone to hear , " Now , boy  --  now ! Deliver the telegram ! " On the stage the great lady pretended not to be aware of this commotion . " Ladies , " she began to say . " Members of the Ithaca Parlor Lecture Club  --  " Her voice was equal in unattractiveness to her person . Homer Macauley hurried up onto the stage and in a very clear voice announced , " Telegram for Rosalie Simms-Pibity ! " The great lady stopped her speech and turned to the messenger as if his appearance was utterly accidental . " Here , boy , " she said , " I am Simms-Pibity ! " 212At the Parlor Lecture ClubShe glanced back at the audience and said , " Excuseme , ladies . " She signed for the telegram , took it from the messenger , and then offered him a dime , saying , " And that 's for you , boy . " This was painful to Homer but at the same time everything had been so ridiculous and confusingthat he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small coin and , very much embarrassed , hurried down from the stage and out of the building . As he hurried he could hear the woman beginningher speech . " Now , in 1939 , " she said , " just before the outbreak of this new War , I chanced to be in Bavaria on a secret mission , disguised as an Alsatian milkmaid . " In the street , seated on the sidewalk , Homer saw Henry Wilkinson who had lost both legs in a railwayaccident when he was a young man . Now , thirty years later , he had taken to holding a hat in his lap containing pencils . Homer did not know him by name but had seen him all his life . Somehow or other he had never gotten around to buying a pencilor dropping a coin into the hat . The dime from Rosalie Simms-Pibity had already become an object of which he wished to be rid . Therefore , upon seeingHenry Wilkinson , Homer dropped the dime into the man 's hat and hurried to his bicycle . He had swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street when he decided that something was wrong with what he had done , so he turned213The Human Comedyaround and hurried back , dropped his bicycle on the sidewalk and ran over to the man who had lost his legs thirty years ago , and this time Homer dropped a quarter  --  his own  --  into the hat . CHAPTER 30AT THE BETHEL ROOMSA half hour later the messenger got off his bicycle at the door of the Bethel Rooms on Eye Street and climbed the long flight of stairs . There was no desk , only a counter in a corner of the spacious hall . On the counter was a solitary press-down bell and a sign on the wall over the bell which said Ring . The messenger looked around a moment , noticing the many closed doors of the small hotel . He then looked at the telegram which was addressed to Dolly Haw- thorne . In one of the rooms a phonograph was going , and he could hear two young women and two men talking and laughing . After a moment a man of215The Human Comedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the rooms and stood at the door talking to a young woman whose head alone was visible to Homer . Then the door closed quickly and the roan went down the stairs . Homer pressed the bell on the counter . The door which had just been closed now opened again and the girl called out , almost cheerfully it seemed , " O.K. , in a minute . " When the girl appeared , the messenger was amazed that she was so beautiful and young . She did n't seem very much different from Mary or Bess . " Telegram for Dolly Hawthorne , " the messenger said to the young woman . " She 's out just now , " the young woman said . " Can I sign for it ? " " Yes , ma'am , " Homer said . The young woman signed for the telegram and then looked at Homer curiously . " Wait just a minute , will you ? " she said suddenly . She turned and ran all the way down the hall into another room . While she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counter near Homer . He and Homer looked at one another several times . When the girl came running back and saw the man she called Homer , and together they went into the room from which she had first emerged . The room had a strange , sickening odor which the messenger had never before known . The young woman handed the messenger a letter . " Will you mail this letter for me ? " she said . She216looked the messenger straight in the eye . " It is very important , " she said . " It 's to my sister . Take it to the Post Office  --  airmail , special delivery , registered . There 's money in the letter . My sister needs money . I have n't got any stamps . " Now the young woman stopped a moment so that Homer might have time to understand how important it was for him to attend to the mailing of the letter . " Will you do it for me ? " she said . For some reason which he could n't quite understand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sickness he had felt in the house of the Mexican woman whose son had been killed in the War . " Yes , ma'am , " Homer said . " I 'll take the letter right down to the Post Office  --  airmail , special delivery , registered . I 'll take it right down , " he said again . " Here 's a dollar , " the young woman said . " Put the letter in your hat . Do n't let anybody see it . Do n't tell anybody about it . " " Yes , ma'am , " Homer said . " I wo n't tell anybody . " He put the letter in his hat . " I 'll take it straight to the Post Office . Then I 'll bring you your change . " " No , " the young woman said , " do n't come back . Now hurry ! And remember  --  do n't let anybody know . " " I wo n't , " Homer said , and left the room . He reached the steps just as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first landing of the217The Human Comedystairway Homer came face to face with an enormous , handsomely-dressed woman who was fifty or fiftyfiveyears of age . The woman stopped when she saw the messenger and smiled at him . " Telegram for me ? " she said . " Dolly Haw-thorne ? " " Yes , ma'am , " Homer said , " I left it upstairs . " " That 's a good boy , " Dolly Hawthorne said . She looked at Homer a moment and then said , " You 're a new messenger , are n't you ? Oh , I know all the boys .

" Dolly Hawthorne opened an expensive jeweled handbag and brought out some calling cards . " Here , " she said . She handed Homer about twenty of the cards . " What 's this for ? " Homer said . " You go to a lot of places with telegrams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars and places like that  --  well , just leave a card somewhere  --  on the bar as you go out .

He went on down the stairs to the street and Dolly Hawthorne went on up to the Bethel Rooms . CHAPTER 31MR . MECHANOAfter their adventure in the public library , Lionel and Ulysses continued to explore Ithaca . At sundownthey found themselves standing at the very front of a small crowd of idlers and passers-by , watching a man in the window of a third-rate drug store . The man moved like a piece of machinery , although he was a human being . He looked , however , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He seemed inhuman and in fact he looked like nothing so much as an upright , unburied corpse still capable of moving . The man was the most incredible thing Ulysses had seen in all of his four years of life in the world. 218 I1 **25;8966;TOOLONG afternoon when she returned home she saw the reflection of her face in the rectangular mirror over the fireplace as she passed the downstairsparlor . Something drew her to the glass . During the months of the fall , whenever her anxieties would come to a momentary crisis , she had noticed that the little swelling under the corner of her mouth would come forth ; when she had pushed the fears to the back of her mind , the blemish gradually disappeared . Now as she gazed into the mirror she saw that it had come out again , this time larger than before . It 's my King George 's Mark , she thought , like Grandmother Mc-Dowell'smark on her forehead . IIFrom the labyrinth of her brain a thought shot forth : They think my husband is dead ! There could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father had known there was bad news when he had been home for Christmas . Nor did she imagine that these people were making up a story from whole cloth ; somewhere , somehow , a report had come out of the West that Lieutenant Fremont was in trouble . But where had it come from ? And how could she find out what it was ? If John were dead , then for her all the world was dead . She remem-beredthe story of Grandmother Benton : she had been only thirty when her husband died . Young Tom was not allowed to see his mother for three months . When he had seen her last she had been a lovely , blue-eyed woman ; when he was taken in to her again he found in place of the vivacious young woman he had known a thin white-haired old lady . No one knew better than Jessie that the Bentons loved only once . At last she cornered an old trapper who had not the guile to deceive her . He told her that a report had come out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his party intact , had then made the hazardous crossing from the Columbia to the Truckee River just east of the Sierras . Here he had disregarded the advice of the Indians that the Sierras were impassable , had plunged into the ice and snow , been enveloped by blizzards , and vanished completely . No word had come out of California of his arrival at Captain Sutter 's , and so much time had passed in the interval that it would have been impossible for him not to have perished . Having been separated from her husband for ten months , Jessie had imagined that she had learned all there was to know about the anatomy of loneliness . She imagined that loneliness had a traceable pattern , that once she had met the worst of it , she would recognize her old enemy when he arose the next time , and would have the technique with which to combat it . But she found that loneliness was a Hydra-headed monster who never appeared twice in the same shape or form ; that it was an unslayable enemy who thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when one was beginning to feel some small measure of security . I t could emerge in the middle of a page of print and make a superb piece of prose suddenly unendurable ; it could burst forth when one was washing one 's face or combing one 's hair , and the brush would fall out of the hand and the soap drop into the basin and one 's reflection in the mirror stare back like a lifeless mask ; it could get into one 's mouth while one was talking , and the words would die and the teeth would clench , and the lips would be bitten ; it could crawl into bed at night when one lay half awake , half asleep , and bring with it the most excruciating torture of all , making of this one small bed a wide and empty world with no man to love , no husband to embrace , no arms to lock one safely against the darkness and the fatality of life . Yet this kind of loneliness was endurable because the loved one would return ; the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the loved one is never to return ? For four days she went with little food or drink or sleep , walking through her duties with her feelings numbed . She did not accept the fact of John 's death any more than she was able to repudiate it . She knew that if there was any man who could get through the Sierras in the face of blizzards , it was he . But if no human being could get through , what then ? Toward dawn of the fifth day , as she lay rigid on her bed , the cycle of anxiety broke ; she fell into a sound sleep . When she awakened at noon the leaped out of bed , bathed , brushed and combed her long hair , donned a close-fitting blue silk dress which she had made almost daringly short in front , exposing her ankle , in order to get some comfort in walking the rough cobblestones of St. Louis . After luncheon she spent an hour with Lily , then put on a matching jockey cap of blue silk and set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " You can stop your worrying . Lieutenant Fremont and his party are safe . " They betrayed their past concern when several of them exclaimed at once : " Oh , Jessie , how wonderful , we are so happy for you , we are so relieved ! When did the news come ? How did he manage to survive in the mountains under those , horrible conditions ? " " There has been no news . I have received no letter . I simply know that my husband is safe . Nothing could possibly persuade me otherwise . LieutenantFremont will be home in a very few weeks . " Her cousins were shocked . When she saw the frightened expression in their eyes , she smiled and said : " No , my dears , I have not gone out of my mind . What I know , I know.  | It is almost a year now since Lieutenant Fremont left on his expedition . He will soon be back in St. Louis . " SHE THREW HERSELF into a happy fever of preparation for his return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring cleaning she turned the house upside down and had everything scrubbed , whitewashed , painted and waxed . Then she planned new outfits for herself and Lily , spending hours cutting out dresses and embroidering on them . She set a place each night at the table for John , and when the rest of the family had finished dinner , his setting was transferred to a small table by the fire . His food was left on the kitchen stove where it could be heated on short notice . " A man must not feel unexpected , " she said . A log fire was kept burning brightly in the downstairs parlor , which she replenished just before she went to sleep . However , sleep was the last of her desires ; she stayed up until midnight studying and perfecting her Spanish , which she felt would be a great asset when she returned to California with her husband . She then placed her reading lamp on a table by the window that faced toward town , a light which he must see from far off as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not that she thought he needed light to guide his steps , this man who had just crossed an uncharted continent , but only that it would stand for the light in her heart and for her great and burning desire for him to be back . She knew that he would understand . Occasionally she would fall asleep in her chair by the fire , but she would awake with a start thinking she heard footsteps outside , those short , swift , staccato footsteps which distinguished him from every other man in the world just as surely as did his voice or his appearance . Some time after midnight she would go to bed and lie there certain that he would return before morning , catching only snatches of troubled , conscious sleep . By dawn she was up again to put away the lamp , to remove the setting from the table by the fireplace , to face another day of waiting , sustaining herself on faith and devotion , feeding off them because no other food was digestible . March passed , and then April . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of St. Louis was positive that he and his party had perished in the snows of the Sierras . When her cousins learned that she was setting a place at the table for him each night , saving his food and lighting a lamp to guide his footsteps , they became concerned for her sanity . She grew thinner and frailer . By June , one year from the day he hadp103eft , she was down to ninety pounds , her skin pulled taut over the bones , her eyes enormous and staring in her hollow-cheeked face , the King George 's Mark flaming red below the corner of her mouth . There was something about going into the second year of separation which broke down her discipline . She ceased reading altogether , almost ceased thinking . There were no longer any divisions in her mind between night and day , nor among the weeks or months . The heat of summer sapped her last strength as she drifted through the days of July and early August . It was five months since she had told her cousins that John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was the only one in the United States who thought so . In the early morning of August seventh when she had fallen into that curious state she had known so many months of being a little asleep and yet terribly awake , she heard the sound of excited voices below her in the hallway . She jumped out of bed , put on a robe and ran downstairs . Maylee was talking to Gabriel , who was either excited or trembling with fear . She heard him say : " I hear pebbles against my window . . . the coachhouse . . . I look out . There Lieutenant Fremont . He ask can I let him in without I wake the family ? " Jessie confronted the old man . " You say you saw Lieutenant Fremont ? What time was it ? Why did n't you bring him to me ? " " It must be three o'clock , Miss Jessie . Ile say he wait till morning , he do n't want to wake nobody , he walk downtown till dawn . " Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fourteen months ; footsteps running up the front stairs ; a sharp knock at the door , and John was in the hallway , had brushed past Gabriel and held her half fainting in his arms . He carried her to one of the larger chairs , sat down with her , covered her trembling face with kisses . Word spread around town almost as fast as though a cannon had been fired . Friends began thronging into the Benton house . By eight in the morning it had turned into a full-scale reception , with people laughing and crying and everybody talking at once . Jessie 's happiness returned in a great rush . The waiting was over now , all the uncertainty gone . Beside her sat her husband , thinner than she , his cheeks sunken , his skin gray and blotched with stubble , his face engravedwith heavy lines of fatigue , his eyes a little wild , his clothes threadbare . But here he sat beside her , his bony tired arm about her tired shoulder , his exhausted voice against her unhearing ear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She knew that neither of them was beautiful to look at , but ah , how beautiful the world , how beautiful to be together again ! At noon the milling throng of friends departed . " My poor darling , " said Jessie , " you have no luck : when you came k home from your first expedition I was big with child ; and now I am as skinny as a starved cat . " " You never looked more beautiful , " he replied , kissing her full on the mouth . The kindness broke the back of her resolve to be calm ; she began blubbering like a child , and he had to hold her against him so hard that there was almost no breath left in her body . Later she said , " I must tell you why I sent that message to Kaw 's Landing . I hope you will approve of what I did , but if you do not approve , you must tell me so quite honestly so that I may use it as a guide for future conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew there was sufficient reason to go , " he said . " What happened ? " " A letter arrived from the Topographical Department calling you to Washington to explain the presence of a cannon on a peaceful expedi-tion . " " A recall . But that would have meant . . . " " . . . another officer was being sent to take your place . " " Take my place ! " He reared up like a balky horse , his face a dull , brick red . " It 's that West Point clique ! They 're jealous of what I 've accom-plished . " " Then I did right to suppress the order ? " " Right ! " He shouted at her as though she were the entire West Point aristocracy . " You would have been a fool if you had n't . You saved the day for all of us . " " Good ! What happened to the cannon ? Was it valuable ? Were you able to bring it back ? " " Yes and no : it staved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but it might have cost us several men . We pulled that cannon from Kaw 's Landing fifteen hundred miles to the Dalles on the Columbia , then another four hundred miles through the snow and icy passes going south from Oregon to the east side of the Rockies . We even got it halfway across the Sierras ; there we lost it in snowdrifts twelve feet high . We were hard pressed to save our own lives , and the cannon had to be abandoned . " " I 'm sorry you could n't have brought it back to the Jefferson Barracks . But since it saved you from an attack you have justified its presence to both Colonel Abert and Colonel Kearny . " " Wait until they see our maps and reports , Jessie ; we 'll both be vindi-cated. "  |p105It  was then she asked , " What happened in the Sierras ? Why did the report get out that you and your party had perished ? Did you have terrible hardships ? Were you in serious danger ? " He rubbed his feet up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left her side , had gone back to the Sierras and the blinding snows . " Hardships ? Yes . Danger ? Yes . Death ? No . Only the weak die on the t rail . Only those whose will power succumbs to a stronger force . I crossed the Sierras in midwinter , Jessie , when the Indians who had lived there all their lives said it was impossible . I am the first man to traverse the Sierras in winter . I found a pass over a fourteen-thousand-foot wall of ice when we were all nine-tenths dead and everyone except Carson and myself had abandoned hope . I forced that crossing , Jessie , right where my calculation told me it must be . And once we were over , we dropped straight down into the Sacramento Valley and Sutter 's Fort . I found a straight route and a new pass to California ; one day it will be as widely used as the Oregon Trail . If war comes with Mexico , we will take California by the Army moving in over the trail I blazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was the greatest experience of my life ! I was defeated ; the Sierras had whipped me ; it was impossible for humans to get through . . . we were only shadows of men , almost too weak to move ; the snow lay so deep neither man nor horse could struggle forward ; we were too blinded to see , too cold to feel , too hungry to move our legs . Never has a party been closer to death and destruction . " He paced up and down the room . " That 's when a man lives at his height , when he is beaten , when all the world knows he 's beaten , when Ice has n't the slimmest chance , and yet he pushes through , he defeats and surmounts all the obstacles , when he is stronger than nature , when he is the strongest force on earth . For , Jessie , I found that pass ! I found it without food or strength or eyesight or arms or legs . I crawled up over ten thousand feet and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party and dragged them up with me , men and horses , both . Ah Jessie , such moments , such triumphs are vouchsafed but a few times in a man 's life . " And Jessie , sitting there , intensely proud of his accomplishment , found her heart wrung in pity ; pity for this unfortunate creature who must make himself a king because in his own mind he was not a whole man . In he icy passes of the Sierras the last could be first , John Fremont had vindicated himself : by making himself the conqueror of nature he had conquered his own illegitimacy . If only he could live forever in these icy passes , she thought , overcoming insurmountable obstacles , making impossibleconquests , then always he would be a king , the fear and uncertaintyp106would vanish , the enigma of John Charles Fremont would be solved and vanquished . THE NEXT TWO WEEKS were delightful ones . Lingering over their late breakfast , Jessie heard her husband say in a ruminative voice : " The man who has a good wife is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no real happiness or success in life for the man with a poorish wife , and there can be no genuine failure for the man with a good wife . What a stroke of pure genius I had when I recognized you , Jessie . I shall always think well of myself for that magnificent flash of wisdom . " She chuckled at the oblique compliment . " And what about me ? " she asked . " Do n't I get any credit for recognizing you ? " " A relatively minor accomplishment , compared to mine . Do you know wherein the true greatness of your accomplishment lies ? " " Do tell me . " " In the fact that , search my memory as I will , I can find no scars on our marriage . I know that I have sometimes been difficult and unreasonable , that you are hard pressed not to become angry with me or lose patience . But you have been so unfailingly kind , you have kept our relationshipso sympathetic and serene that , when I want to quarrel with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to fester . I ca n't even conjure up a quarrel with you in my imagination . That is a great accomplishment , Jessie , and all the credit must go to you . " " A mere nothing , " she mocked , to conceal her emotion . " All you need is love , and it 's as easy as falling off a precipice . " At the end of two weeks they had completed their arrangements to leave for Washington . They took the steamboat to Wheeling , where they rented a carriage and drove the rest of the way along the now completed national road to Washington . It was good to be home again in Washington , but the crush of people was so great in the Benton house that it proved impossible for them to get to work on their report . At the beginning of October , when she was looking well and fresh again , she found a vacant two-storied cottage just a block away . She took John to see it , showing him through excitedly . " Look , darling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need know it is our workshop . We can turn these two upstairs rooms into writing rooms and give the downstairs quarters to Preuss and John Hubbard for their maps . Does it look good to you ? " " Rent it at once , " he replied . " I 'll move over our notes and journals first thing in the morning . "  |p107John  and her father rose at dawn , had their showers , coffee and rolls at six , and John left for his cottage . Jessie was not allowed to appear until nine . From nine until one she worked with him on the report . Then Maylee would arrive with little Lily under one arm and a luncheon basket under the other and tell them stories of the baby while they ate cold chicken on cornbread and munched fresh fruit . After lunch Maylee would place Lily in the basket and take her back home , while the Fremonts went for a half-hour 's walk along the Potomac before returning to the workshop . John had done an even better job on his journals than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnificent wealth of scientific observation , vivid descriptions of the trail , the mountains , the rivers and the forests ; and of the greatest importance to her , the rich and natural poetry of his mind when , sitting by his campfire late at night , he had written unrestrainedly of everything he had seen and experienced . There was no hesitation in their collaboration now ; each knew his own role and was respectful of the contribution of the other . She took the utmost pains to preserve the color and flavor and beauty of his rough notes , the sharp pungency of the stories he told , content to contribute form and organization , to burn  --  out the dross and to leave John 's work appearing at its best . They labored for five months on the report , the most concentrated piece of work she had ever done . She knew her contribution to this document to be a modest one , and for that reason she felt secure in believing that it was to be one of the great books of exploration ; here were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icy blue crags which had not been surpassed for beauty in any literature she knew ; here was an entirely new fund of material about the Indians and their way of life ; here were studies of the souls of men enduring excruciating agonies , bending under the burden but always snapping back ; here was a fluid technique of exploration which utilized everything known to the minds of explorers , yet went beyond all precedent of daring ingenuity and resourcefulness in the face of hardships which staggered the imagination ; here was a wealth of observation on botany , geology , the nature of mountain and snow and forest which had not been surpassed for scientific meticulousness or for the brilliance of poetic observation . Colonel Kearny came to Washington on army business and was invited to dinner by Tom Benton . A blunt and earnest man , he was not one to allow a fractured relationship to limp along without splint or bandage . Ile found a moment alone with Jessie , saying to her in his slightly rough voice , " Do not mistake me , Miss Jessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has worked out so well . I am putting the entire incident out of my mind . "  |p108The  following evening she and John were invited to Colonel Abert 's home as guests of honor at a dinner for the officers of the Topographical Corps . She was slow and uncertain in her dressing ; John urged her to hurry several times , but she could not seem to complete her coiffure . " What are you fretting about ? " he asked . " I 'm afraid . Colonel Abert 's home is almost the last one in Washington I care to go into . " " Colonel Abert is a subtle man ; he 's not like Colonel Kearny . He will never mention that obstructed order , any more than he ever answered your letter . " " Nevertheless I 'm nervous , " she replied , " so nervous that I ca n't get this confounded part straight in the middle of my hair . " " Then leave it crooked . I do n't want to be late . " But when she got to Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without words to carry her over the difficult moment of meeting , the colonel welcomed her with warmth and charm , seated her at his right and was more delightful than she had ever known him . She could n't touch the delicious bouillabaisse for fear that his charm was only a front , that the colonel would take the first opportunity to reprove her ; but by the time the mallards and suckling pig arrived she saw that her little uprising had been forgiven . The frequent meetings which took place in the Benton home showed Jessie and John that to official Washington the most interesting part of his trip  --  was his brief sojourn in California : for war with Mexico over the annexation of Texas seemed to be growing closer every day , and nearly everyone in Washington was resolved that California must not fall into British hands . Senator Benton , as chairman of the Military Affairs Committee , had been receiving disquieting news . " That magnificent coast and its harbors are going to fall into British hands like ripe fruit off a tree , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of acres in a huge tract , and the British are sending in a whole colony of Irish families . If that colony gets established , California will be lost to us . " No one in the capital had been in California except John , and his opinion was eagerly sought . There was material which Jessie had not been able to write into the report . for Mexico was still considered a friendly nation , but he had sketched for her the outlines of his findings : Mexico City 's only interest in this vast country appeared to be the taxes it could extract ; no Mexican colonizing was going on ; the Mexican government kept a small army in California , inadequately equipped and officered . There were almost a hundred fast-shooting Americans in California , nonep109of whom liked the Mexican rule and nearly all of whom would fight to join the United States . " An army officer with a hundred men under him could capture California , " said Lieutenant Fremont , " only they have to be there at the right moment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a year after he had crossed the Sierras , Jessie asked anxiously : " Will Congress order a thousand extra copies to be printed again ? That was such a tremendous help last time . " " I hardly think so , Jessie . " " Why not ? This report is far superior to the last , and all the material from South Pass to the Pacific coast is new . . . " " But it stretched to three hundred pages ; Congress may find it too long and boring . " Before she could answer she saw that he had been teasing her . On March 3 , 1845 , the day before President James K. Polk was to be inaugurated , John came home flushed with pleasure . " What do you think ? " he exclaimed . " The Senate passed a resolution ordering five thousand extra copies of our report . " " Five thousand , " exclaimed Jessie , " why , that 's magnificent ! " " Only half as magnificent as what finally happened : James Buchanan praised me to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ten thousand copies . And here , my dear , read what Secretary Buchanan said about your husband . I 'm too modest to tell you . " Jessie made a mocking grimace , then read aloud Buchanan 's statement to the Senate of John 's progress : " He is a young gentleman of extraordinarymerit , great energy and ability to serve his country . Lieutenant Fremont deserves encouragement . " Hiding her pleasure under a little joke , she said , " I never found that you needed encouragement ; you just sort of reach out and grab everything you want . " The next day Jessie did her hair in the new Polish fashion with a braid of nine strands , a small bunch of flowers and leaves hanging from the coil at the back , and on top of her head a small black muslin cap . Her new gown was black moire , with the bodice opening over a chemisette of white muslin . Her silk paletot wrap was trimmed with black lace and ( caught around the waist with a broad ribbon . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her husband . " Why do you always get dressed up in your best clothes and look so gorgeous when we go out ? " he countered . " Why do n't you get dressed up like that for me when we stay home ? " " You 're supposed to love me for my spiritual values , dear , not for my new clothes . "  | " But even your spiritual values show up to better advantage in a black moire gown . " Driving up Pennsylvania Avenue , Jessie asked , " Do you remember the last reception we came to ? We were newly married and President Tyler gave us the first clue that an expedition might be ordered . " " I hope that established a precedent for inaugurals , " he replied . " I would like President Polk to give me an intimation today that he favors a third expedition to California . " " I 'm sure he will , dear , " she murmured . " Who could resist you when you look so beautiful in your new uniform ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulate the president quite as much as I do my wife . " They were welcomed on the reception line by Nancy Polk , Jessie 's longtimefriend . After the formalities were over , President Polk summoned them and , surrounded by a group of army officers and Cabinet members , asked Lieutenant Fremont for stories of the West . He chose a number of short and dramatic incidents which seemed to capture the president 's imagination . Encouraged by his success , he became emboldened to say , " Mr. President , the entire Pacific coast could be of the utmost value to the United States . Geographically it belongs to us ; there will be a continuousconflict if two or three nations own land on the Pacific . " Polk 's face lost its interested expression ; knowing that he faced four years of being importuned , he said , not unkindly , " Lieutenant Fremont , you suffer from two afflictions under which I labored not so long ago : youth and impulsiveness . I expect you will outgrow them both ; in the meanwhile please accept my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieutenant and Mrs. Fremont found themselves dismissed . On the way home in their carriage they were a little glum together . " The precedent fell on its face , " mourned John . " Mr. Polk has no intention of backing a third expedition . " " Maybe he just needs a little time . I do wish we could have told all this to Nancy . She is open to new ideas , and she would have known how to convince the president . " It was no surprise to Jessie that when Congress released the second report , Lieutenant Fremont became the popular hero of America . The newspapers reprinted substantial excerpts , featuring his picture on the front page . Several publishing houses rushed the book into print , and it sold like wildfire , in England almost as widely as in the United States . Honors poured in from scientific societies in England and Europe . General Winfield Scott , founder of America 's professional army , six foot four of military brilliance , came to the Benton home with an **28;8993;TOOLONG in his hand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that President Polk had breveted John captain for " gallant and highly meritorious services in two expeditions commanded by himself . " Such popularity had not been seen in the capital since army generals had won important military victories in the War of 1812 . Sermons were preached on the morals of the expedition , school children had parts of the report read to them in the classrooms ; everywhere in the United States , on small farms , in crossroad stores , in hotels and bars and clubs , on the sidewalks of great cities people gathered to talk about the second Fremont report , to feel in their blood the stir of the westward movement , of the desire to experience these great adventures , to see these beautiful sights , to farm this new and rich land , to win property in this vast new country , to be once again movers , doers , breakers of trails , settlers , pioneers of new states as well as new lands : to be their own man . And Jessie Benton Fremont was content ; she had known her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized him for the strength and greatness that were in him ; she had helped him beat his road through the mountains ; she had strengthened his sinews and extended his reach , made him a little bigger by lending that little talent which had been hers to contribute . These were the things of which she had dreamed when her mind had turned to marriage . THE ARGUMENT IN WASHINGTON Over the possibility of war with Mexico because of the annexation of Texas waged warmer every day . Much of it centered in the home of Chairman Benton , of the Senate Military Affairs Committee , and his son-in-law , Captain Fremont . Senator Benton was averse to war with Mexico , felt that Texas and the Southwest , including California , should be bought at a fair figure , just as the vast Louisiana Purchase had been made from France . There was neither ethics nor justicein forcing Mexico to sell , and even though this attitude of purchase was comparatively new on the international scene , Tom Benton realized that his government was on the difficult side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was a hang-over from the Spanish days , and there was little likelihood that the country could become prosperous or settled while being ruled from Mexico City . Nevertheless , it legally belonged to Mexico . Captain Fremont , thinking as a military man , was more opportunistic in his attitude . He did n't care how the United States got California  --  by purchase , occupation , seizure , or even pure theft. pI I 2 " My ethics may be a little obscure , " he admitted to Jessie , " but my eyesightis perfect . I have been to California . I know . that geographically it belongs to the United States . I should like to help in its acquisition . I ca n't shed any tears over the Mexicans ; aside from the revenues they extract , they are as interested in California as we are in the moon . " One evening when she was browsing through a copy of the United Science Journal , published in London , she found a. passage which considerablystartled her . She exclaimed , " Father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt that we , the English , have three powerful rivals in France , Russia , and the United States , but of these three the Americans are the most important on account of their origin , their courage , and their even greater enterprise and activity than our own . They have raw material , workingmen , and sufficient merchant navy to arm as men-of-war when called upon to do so . ' " Senator Benton , who had disliked the British profoundly since the War of 1812 , snatched up the newspaper , put on a hat and coat and walked to Senator Calhoun 's house . Calhoun felt confirmed in his suspicion that England intended to wage war against the United States for the acquisition , first of Oregon , then of California . The two men marched militantly to Secretary of Navy George Bancroft 's house . The next morning SecretaryBancroft had a long session with President Polk . Within a very few days the third expedition to the West had been authorized , the War Departmenthad set aside fifty thousand dollars for its prosecution , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of confidential meetings were exciting for Jessie , but before long a tinge of uneasiness crept into her thoughts : everyone wanted to acquire California and would prefer to buy it at a reasonable figure , yet it was obvious that no one wanted to let it go by default to England if it could n't be bought . Men spoke of how valuable and importantCalifornia was , how it was manifest destiny that it belong to the United States ; everyone was certain that Mexico would not sell or negotiate ; everyone seemed to know that California would have to be seized if the United States were not to lose the territory to England . Yet no one would admit he thought this , no one was willing to be quoted to that effect , no one wanted to be held responsible for outlaw conduct or go down in the historic record as an instigator of an international theft . Many of Captain Fremont 's superior army officers , many cabinet members , senators and congressmen assured him how happy they were that a scientific expedition was on its way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have an army officer present in the event that war should break ; yet no one would lay out a definite course of conduct or give him specific authorization.  | " Everybody knows what they would like you to do , " said Jessie , " but no one is willing to take the responsibility for it . " " It 's not difficult to understand , " replied John . " We are still at peace with Mexico ; no representative of our government can go on record as sponsoring aggression . That would make the United States government responsible for his acts . But I am not an official representative of the government . I am just a captain in the Topographical Corps . Anything I may do , aside from exploring , I do on my own responsibility . If I embarrassmy government , they can disavow me . " " I do wish that you could get some kind of written authorization . " " It 's not possible in such a delicate situation . It may be that Mexico will sell us California ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up an independent republic , the way they did in Texas ; it may be that the time is not yet ripe for annexation . In any of these instances it would be dangerous for me to have authorization to do anything but explore and make maps of the Pacific coast . " She planned to remain in the capital during her husband 's absence , for the situation had changed so rapidly that Washington City rather than St. Louis would now be the hub of activity for the West . She knew that this separation would be the longest of all , that her husband would have to remain on the Pacific coast until the climax of events could release him . How long would he be away ? A year , two years , three years ! She had hoped to go with him the next time he went to California ; instead she faced a staggering separation . Her only reassurance was that this would probably be the last time he would go west without her . They had agreed that he was to invest their savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and San Francisco . California would be an Americanstate within a few years , and the Fremonts would be among its first settlers . They spent their last evening together in their upstairs sitting room after a jolly family dinner at which Mrs. Benton had been the only one to break down and show how bad she felt about his leaving . To everyone 's amazement , Eliza had asked permission to invite a young lawyer she had met recently , a tall , spindly , blond chap , quiet and dry-spoken . The preparations for the expedition had gone smoothly , except that Preuss , the magnificent map maker , had had to withdraw because his wife had issued him an ultimatum : " Choose between your home and family and your instinct to wander . " While Jessie sat sewing a waterproof pocket on the side of John 's canvas-and-leather jacket , in which he was to keep his valuable papers dry , her husband cried : " Darling , how can I leave you here ? I was gone for fourteen monthsp114last time ; this time I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go so fast , but when I am away from you they drag so terribly . " A tear splashed on the leather pocket . " There , " she said , " your jacket has been christened . Now it will bring you good luck . " She ran her fingers through his short black hair . " It was good of you to say that , even though in its strictest sense it is n't true ; you live at the height of excitement when you are on the trail . Your job is to go , my job is to let you go cheerfully . " " Confound it , Jessie , would you mind looking a little sad so that my ego can be inflated ? " " Like your India-rubber boat ? You would n't want me to be a Mrs. Preuss . I decided long ago that you would tire of a pining wife . My dear , I do n't want you to tire of me , I want you to love me all our long lives together . " When she awakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before her , holding a copy of the Union for her to see . In the center of the front page was a large picture of Captain Fremont . " How wonderful , Maylee , to be greeted by my husband 's face when I can not be greeted by his voice . Would you like to hear what they say ? " Captain Fremont has gone upon his third expedition , determined upon a complete military and scientific exploration of all the vast unknownregion between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Ocean , and between the Oregon River and the Gulf of California . This expedition is expected to continue nearly two years , and its successful result is looked to with the highest degree of interest by all the friends of science in America and Europe . His life is a pattern and his success an encouragement to young men of America who aspire to honorable distinction by their own meritorious exertions . ' " She hardly had had time to adjust herself to his absence when Secretary of State James Buchanan dropped in unannounced , gratefully accepted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might speak to her privately . She led him to the library , closed the door behind them . James Buchanan had come to Washington to enter the House at the same time that Tom Benton had arrived to enter the Senate ; thus Jessie had known him all her life . He was a good-looking man with an open face , almost round eyes , and what women thought an amorous mouth . He was a lonely man who had endured tragedy in his youth : the girl to whom he was devoted with the single-purposeness of his nature had become angry with him over a bit of gossip . Without giving him a chance to explain , she had terminated their engagement and boarded a train to visit some relatives in New York . She died while en route ; he never was able to learn whether it had been a natural death , an accident , or suicide : nor had he ever ceased reproach/ing himself for not having prevented her from leaving . After the loss of his first love he had never loved again or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bachelorhood . James Buchanan never pretended to be brilliant , but he was conscientiousand painstaking . A man of quiet charm who had developed an ironcladsystem of logic from his studies of the law , he had been respected as minister to Russia , his constituents in Pennsylvania had declared him to be a valuable senator . He lived an impeccable private life , taking pleasure from work well done ; he was a man who loathed force , crudity , irregularity . If some people thought him too meticulous , too encased in an unassailable shell of formal manners , too spinsterish , these qualifications had enabled him for some twenty-five years to render valuable service to his state and his country . Jessie noticed a curious thing about him : the front half of his full underlip , the exposed half , was always dry , apparently covered by a fine white powder . Anyone looking at him would think him to be a dry and powdery man . Yet when he opened his mouth to speak , the inner half of his lip was revealed to be red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James Buchanan : inwardly he lived a rich intellectual and spiritual life ; the side which he exposed to public view he allowed to appear dry and dead . While she had been ruminating about his life and career , he had begun to speak. " . difficult to understand how a woman of her family background and breeding . . . I refused to believe it for some time until I felt obliged to make a test . There can be no doubt of it , Mrs. Greenhow is a spy , in fte pay of the British government . " If the accusation had not come from the secretary of state himself , Jessie would have refused to believe it . " Mrs. Greenhow a spy ! Why , her family is one of the best in Washgton ! " " We must spend our time not in trying to understand the lady 's motives , ' It in undoing the harm she has accomplished . Do I remember rightly that your Spanish is good ? " " Quite good . Father brought me up with the language . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of his lip , moistening the white powder before speaking . " You know how delicate our situation is with Mexico . I have private and confidential reports coming in every day . I never learned to read Spanish , and since the revelation about Mrs. Greenhow , I feel that I dare pot trust anyone in my own office . Would you translate these confidentialports for me ? Would you survey the Spanish newspapers and magazines and write me a report every few days on the tone and temper of the Mexican press ? " " Mr. Buchanan , I thank you with all my heart for this opportunity , and you may be sure that I will do a good job . " " Of that I am certain , Miss Jessie . You realize , of course , no part of the information you gather from the confidential reports may be passed on to your father . As secretary of state I am an officer of the executive branch of the government , while your father , as the chairman of the Senate Military Affairs Committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be no conflict between us over the national interest , there is sometimes a struggle between the executive and the legislative over the powers of government . " " I understand , Mr. Secretary . No word of my information will reach Senator Benton . " " Good ! And now the last stricture : your husband is en route to the Pacific coast . There are certain people in our government who would be willing to encourage him to use force in taking California . To this attitude I am unalterably opposed . I shall have to ask that no part of your informationbe transmitted to Captain Fremont . I would be violating the function of my office if he were to secure advance and confidential informationwhich might precipitate him into a conflict with the Mexicans . " " You will see , Mr. Secretary , that all American women are not irre-sponsible . " Secretary Buchanan rose , bowed stiffly . " Thank you for the cup of tea , Miss Jessie . A page will bring you a pouch early tomorrow morning . Here is a key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while you are working , and never leave the room without returning the papers to the pouch . " " Very good , sir . " He shook her hand , then bade her good day . IN HER FIRST BATCH of confidential papers from Mexico , Jessie learned that the Mexican government was negotiating with Great Britain to intercedein the event of hostilities with the United States . The trouble had arisen over Texas : when the United States annexed Texas , the Mexican government broke off diplomatic relations . When Texas accepted the American offer of annexation , Mexico reorganized its army . President Polk was preparing to send Joseph Slidell to Mexico City as minister , with an offer of forty million dollars for the peaceful purchase of Texas , when news of Mexico 's war preparations flooded Washington . Since thepI17United States and England still were quarreling over the Oregon territory , Jessie concluded from the dispatches that in the event of a war between England and the United States over Oregon , England would seize Californiawith her Navy , having made an advance agreement with Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office the next day to show him her synopsis of the news , he was distressed . He said : " Mexico wants to go to war over Texas ; England seems to want to go to war over Oregon ; the United States seems to want to go to war over California . President Polk fears that the British will accept no compromise on the Oregon boundary , but I am convinced that they will . I am also convinced that Mexico will accept a cash settlement for Texas and California , since they have no legitimate use for them . When our minister goes to Mexico City , I am going to suggest that he offer twenty-five milliondollars for California and New Mexico . " " Yes , Mr. Secretary , but the tone of the Mexican press indicates that they would not consider any price a fair one because they feel they are being forced to sell . Unless there is a sharp change of attitude , our ministermay not even be received . " " Miss Jessie , I am determined to avert war with both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall feel that I have failed in my office . " She rose , assured him that she would keep the information flowing to h i in , and returned home . Her days were so crammed with duties and obligations that she found little time for pining . In addition to her work for Secretary Buchanan and her father , she managed the household and played hostess for unceasing . dinner parties : one for Sam Houston , who had served under her father in the War of 1812 , and who had just arrived in Washington as the first senator from Texas ; one for Commander Robert S. Stockton of the United States warship Princeton , who was about to leave for California and would unquestionably see Captain Fremont when he got there ; one for Secretary of the Navy George Bancroft , a dynamo of energy and a lion of courage , handsome , rugged-faced , virile and militant , young but already famous for his histories of the United States , the leader of the forces in Washington who were determined that all the Southwest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bloody war with Mexico ; one for John L. Stevens , author of the travel books on Arabia and Palestine which Jessie had read as a child ; her own dinner party in honor of Samuel Morse , who at long last had been given a small appropriation by Congress , and from a Senate room had sent a message to Baltimore on the first thirty miles of telegraph line.  |p118Her  deepest gratification of the passing weeks was watching Eliza fall in love . She had been alarmed over her twenty-three-year-old sister , for it seemed that Eliza would never care to marry . Jessie watched her sister and William Carey Jones together at the Benton dinner table ; they took each other casually , without personal interest . When the young lawyer asked Tom Benton 's permission to marry Eliza , Jessie understood that that had been their manner of falling in love . One afternoon at the beginning of November , Secretary of the Navy George Bancroft sent a message asking if he might come to tea . Jessie pu on a wide-skirted silk dress that made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived she led him to her sitting room which was filled with the pleasant fragrances of potted rose geraniums burning sassafras wood , Chinese tea and spice cake . George Bancroft was as informal a man as James Buchanan was meticulous . He refused her invitation to a deep lounge chair , taking instead a hard seat , whirled it around so that he was sitting on it backwards , his elbows resting on the back while he looked at her over his own folded arms and half-clenched fists , studying her with magnificently alert widesetblue eyes . He did not speak for several moments . Jessie took in the black hair combed back straight over his head , the sideburns chopped off toward the top of his ears , the long bony , curved , unbeautiful nose with hollows just above the nostrils ; his uneven but rugged and eloquen mouth : a rough-hewn face , muscular , powerful , direct , the face of a m. with a driving will and intellect . She poured him a cup of tea , then lay back in her chaise against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work but curious about wha . he might want of her . " You have been doing some translating for Secretary Buchanan , " h. said , after downing three slices of spice cake . " I only tell you that I know because it means we can go forward from this moment without discussing the background of the Mexican situation . " " Very well , Mr. Secretary . " " Miss Jessie , the British think they are going to capture California wi their warships . They 're mistaken ; they can capture the ports , but the ' ca n't move those ships into the interior . " " Yes , " agreed Jessie , not knowing what he was leading up to . " But what holds true for the British warships holds equally true fo ours : warships can not take possession of a country . We need soldiers i . California . " This time Jessie did not even bother to answer yes . She just sat up little straighter on her chaise , waiting for Bancroft to declare himself . " From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our ships that have put in at Monterey and San Francisco , am certain that we would not need a large force to take California . But ve are faced with a dilemma , Miss Jessie : we can not send troops into the territory of a country with whom we are not at war . And if we do n't send n troops before they declare war , we are going to lose California . " Again she did not interrupt , but rather said to herself : He knows as well as I do that Captain Fremont will soon be on the Pacific coast . He is to army officer . He has sixty well-armed men with him , men who are unquestionably willing and ready to fight . " Things are touch and go , Miss Jessie . President Polk is right in saying liat we can not steal into another man 's orchard , but if the fruit is ripe and is about to fall to the ground , where it will either be stolen or rot , why 1 it unethical to be standing under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only unethical if all opportunism is unethical . " " Which is not necessarily true . As you know , I am a historian ; I have watched the progress of our nation as it has unfolded year by year . I have always been in agreement with your father that this country must andall extend to the Pacific Ocean . It would be criminal stupidity on our ) art to allow California and the Southwest to fall into the hands of a European nation , or even to lie dead and unused by Mexico . That is against our national character ; that is against our national interests ; andam passionately convinced that it is against the entire flow of history . Do you agree with me ? " " I would not be Senator Benton 's daughter if I did not , " said Jessie . " Good , " exclaimed Secretary Bancroft , " then we understand each tiler . " " Yes , " she replied , not knowing what it was that she was supposed to understand . The secretary of the navy had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bancroft seemed to be waiting for her to make the next Move . Seeing that she was not going to say anything , he began again , this Inc Min a more tentative tone of voice . " At first I thought President Polk was in error in not taking a more stand in California , for he is as eager to have California as I am , but as president of a peace-loving country his hands are tied . I have sent several of our ships of war to lie off Mexico and California ports to be on ! Id if anything happens , but beyond that point there is nothing I myselfdo ; as a cabinet officer my hands too are tied . " Knitting her brows Jessie thought , He is trying to lead me to a conclusionwithout involving himself in it . " Without official authorization , " he continued , " nothing can be doneCalifornia . " He was talking fast now . " That is , unless unofficial actiontaken for which the government can not be held responsible . If , for example , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right moment , Mexico would have no opportunity to call for British protection , and England could not take possession . What we desperately need , Mrs. Fremont , is what we will call for the moment an irresponsible man , someone whom we can honestly repudiate if things do not turn out well . " " I see your dilemma , " said Jessie softly , and to herself , even more softly , she said , And I also see mine . He has just called me Mrs. Fremont for the first time ; Mrs. Fremont has a husband by the name of Captain Fremont who at this very moment must be dropping down the Sierras into the Sacramento Valley with a well-trained party . Captain Fremont is an unofficial representative of the United States , not of the government or the Army , but of the scientific Topographical Corps . His rank and his reputation will win him support in California if he should need it , and yet as an " unofficial " of the government he could readily be repudiated . Aloud she said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We understand each other . ' I answered yes , but frankly I did not . Now I think I do . What is it precisely that you would like me to do ? " George Bancroft jumped up from his chair and began striding energeticallyabout the room , picking up objects and laying them down , moving the lighter pieces of furniture around , raising the Venetian blinds , then lowering them again . Watching him , half amused , half frightened , Jessie poured herself a cup of tea and thought , I have put my finger on a sore spot . He ca n't tell me what he wants me to do . He has reached the climax of this scene and he quite frankly does not know where to go from here . But I can outsit him even if he wrecks the whole room . After a few moments he came back to her chaise , dropped down beside her with a hard thud . " Let me sec if I can explain to you the kind of man we need in California : he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders . He must be willing to be an opportunist ; what the outside world might call an adventurer . He must be hotheaded , impulsive , quick to action . He must be a man who is not afraid to face the consequences of rashness , failure and international censure . " " In other words , " murmured Jessie , " he must have a fast trigger finger and a stout heart . " " Ah , Mrs. Fremont , a far stouter heart than you will be able to imagine . I am willing to take the responsibility of causing a war , but I will take that responsibility as secretary of the navy . The man who starts the war with Mexico in California , or seizes that country without a war , can expect no backing and no authorization . We would have to have his resignationin our pocket , dated considerably prior to any conceivable action ,  |p121so  that we could publish it if we thought it expedient to do so . If it became necessary for the United States government to save face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reputation to shreds . He would become an entirely discredited man . If he were a naval officer , I as secretary of the navy would be obliged to call for his court-martial . He Wright never again be trusted , given a responsible position : his life and career could easily be smashed . " " That also I can understand , " said Jessie slowly . " It is tragic that we have no such man in California . Yet even if we had I could send him no written orders or authorization , nor could anyoneelse in the government . If at some future date he were to find it necessary to vindicate himself and were to try to present evidence , such as , let is say , this conversation , I would be obliged to deny that it ever took place . For obviously it never did take place , Mrs. Fremont ; I have just come here to talk with you and unburden my mind . " He smiled warmly . " And now I must bid you good night . It was extremely good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have been quite jealous of Secretary Buchanan , and now I feel that in some small measure I have evened the score . Speaking of Secretary Buchanan , it is hardly necessary for me to tell you that he would agree with nothing I have intimated this evening . The secretary of state is a meticulous man , as indeed the secretary of state ( flight to be . The secretary of the navy is a man of action , even though he been a historian ; and a man of action is what the secretary of the navy needs to be . Good night , Mrs. Fremont ; please do n't trouble to take me down . " For several hours Jessie lay on the chaise dissecting Secretary Bancroft 's statement of the problem . Though he had never once mentioned Captain Fremont 's name , it was clear he had been talking about her husbandIl the time ; there was no other army officer within two thousand miles of California , and no naval officer could possibly act without implicating his vernment . Secretary Bancroft wanted Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment arose ; but he would ' ve him no authorization , he would refuse to stand by him if the seizure iscarried ; he might find it necessary to deny that any such plan for ' aptain Fremont had ever entered his mind . His description of the type f man needed in California , while not altogether complimentary , she had o admit was a fairly accurate description of her husband : impulsive , nick to action  --  like herself , something of an adventurer , more mindful 4 today 's job than tomorrow 's consequences . Would Captain Fremont take this terrible risk ? Would he put . his 4career and future in danger ? Would he stand the chance of having hisp122government declare him an unscrupulous adventurer , cashier him from . the service ? Would he gamble his years of scientific training , his skill as an explorer and topographer , on one turn of the wheel ? Almost as important , Jessie knew , was the question of whether she could allow him to face these hazards . What would happen to him if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no one to back him or stand by him , his former work thrown into deep shadow ? What would happen to the character and spirit and the pride of John Fremont if all the world thought him a disreputable man , one whom his government had been forced to repudiate ? Could he stand up under such a blow ? Could he carry such a burden , this man who had a canker of uncertainty already eating at his vitals , who had to make himself greater than all men in order to feel the equal of the least of them ? Would not such a fate destroy him ? Could he go through life content to know that he had done a service for his government , a service to which he had been directed , though only his president , his secretary of the navy , and his wife knew that he had been acting under orders ? Her heart beat wildly . What would happen to their life together , to their love , their marriage ? She was not able to answer for herself how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she knew for a certainty that nothing could prevent him from taking the gamble . He was not afraid of the word adventurer ; the thought of failure would never enter his mind ; when the time came to seize California , he would lead his men to victory and take over the conquered state . He would be willing to take the risk . She too was not only willing , but eager . History was on the march , and she wanted John to play an importantrole . Here was his chance ; more accurately , since she was ambition . for him , here was their chance . JEssIE woNDERED what she was supposed to do . What action had Secre tary Bancroft meant for her to take ? She was not left long in doubt . The following morning Marine Lieuten ant Archibald H. Gillespie came to the Benton home to announce that h was leaving for California on the warship Cyane . He was carrying dispatchesfrom the president , the State Department , and the secretary of th , navy . He understood that Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would reach the Pacific coast . Would Mrs. Fremon care to send a letter to Captain Fremont in his charge ? He could assuri her it would be delivered safely.  |p123She  sought out her father and quickly gave him the gist of what had happened , without repeating Secretary Bancroft 's words . Did he think Captain Fremont justified in using force against the Mexican Army and the Californios ? Was he convinced this action would be in the best interestsof the United States ? Was it a gamble she could advise her husband to take ? She waited impatiently while Tom turned his thoughts over . When he finally spoke it was in a tone from which he had consciously removed all emotion . " Our people have moved from the Atlantic coast westward , ever westward , " he said . " The movement will grow a hundred times stronger and ifter in the next few years because of Captain Fremont 's expeditions , ports and maps . There is nothing that can stop this flood of immigration new and rich and free lands . Our people will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened in Texas is certain to happen all over the est , spontaneously , without any help or even any encouragement from our government . " " That 's an interesting generality , Father , " she insisted . " My dear , " said Senator Benton softly , " I am eager to instruct Captain remont to go ahead with the conquest of California . But I must also rotect you . You understand what this entails , perhaps another year f separation . . . " " I understand , " she replied firmly . She must give John the signal for action . Everything he had said to her fore he left indicated that he was willing to take these risks ; they had ' reed that the main purpose of the expedition was for him to be on hand the event of war so that he and his party could take over California . ' hey had even arranged a code for confidential communication . There ) 111 ( 1 be no reason for him to have changed his mind . She seated herself at her desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand over the cool surface of the foolscap . For whom was r doing this ? For John , because it was what he most wanted to do reregardlessof the risk involved ? For Tom , because it would fulfill his lifetime . ambition ? For herself , because she was ambitious as a woman and wanted.important things to come to her through her husband : power , prestige , prominence ? It was impossible to separate their interests , but as John 's dark face Id eager eyes glowed back from the paper before her , she knew that she could be doing it for her husband , who would never cease to reproachif she failed to send him the word ; for her husband , whom she mustmirage to seize every important opportunity . As a woman in love she could only urge him to come home ; he had done the work that had been'geed to him ; he could return to make his maps , write the third reportp124which would open the highway to California . But as his wife she would not be faithful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve the full potential of his opportunity . As always when she had her full strength , the wife dominated the woman in her . The marriage was more important than her momentary happiness . She wrote most of the night , telling her husband stories of Lily and of the family , of Eliza 's coming marriage , of the dinner parties and the politics that had been discussed , all the things that a husband who has been away from home for half a year wants to hear . She spoke of her love for him and how much she missed him , how resolutely she was carrying on in the full confidence that his work would be well done . Using their code of reference to things in their past , she gave him a picture of the official status of American and Mexican relations , picking her way carefully among the bones of fact , for her original promise to Secretary Buchanan had been that she would reveal nothing of a confidentialnature which might impel her husband to action . Then she told him that when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel limited by lack of official authorization . She gave no explanation for this sentiment , any more than she had given it two years before when she had sent with DeRosier the order , " Do not delay another day . Trust me , and start at once . " She knew that her husband 's answer would be the equivalent of , " I trust , and go . " Lieutenant Gillespie came for the letter early the next morning , assured her that he would tell Captain Fremont how well the family appeared . She watched him until he turned the corner of C Street and disappeared up Pennsylvania Avenue ; then she knew the die was cast , that before many months Captain Fremont would be involved in action of farreachingconsequences . Christmas passed quietly ; she had decorated a tree in the upstairs sitting room for Lily . When there was an occasional hour of fatigue or shapeless anxiety she would peer into the mirror to see if her King George 's Mark had returned , but could find no trace of it , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When news reached her it was sudden and dynamic . Picking up the morning edition of the Union , she learned that Captain Fremont had se himself up against the Mexican Army . The Mexicans had been suspiciou of him and his party of sixty men , but they had given him temporapermission to remain in California . Toward the end of February Captai Fremont had broken camp and moved , not back to Oregon and America territory as he had promised , but south , deeper into Mexican countryp125Within a couple of days a Mexican cavalry officer had dashed into CaptainFremont 's camp with a dispatch from General Castro ordering the party out of California immediately , assuring them if they did not depart they would be arrested and forcibly expelled by the Mexican Army . Captain Fremont had known that the Mexicans were within their legal rights , that actually he was an intruder on their soil . However , he had spent several months making friends with the Americans in California and sizing up the strength of the Mexican arms . He had come to the conclusion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the threat of expulsion , he would forfeit the respect and confidence of the Americans in California , all of whom would also have lost caste by his retreat . Captain Fremont had decided that the historic moment had arrived . He moved his party to a natural fort on top of a peak overlooking the Santa Clara Valley ; here he cut a tall slender tree and raised the first American flag in California . For three days he and his men had stood ready to defend their fort and their dignity . In the Union Jessie read her husband 's letter to Consul Larkin : From the heights where we are encamped , Hawk 's Peak , we can see with the glass , troops mustering at St. John 's . I would write you at length if I did not fear my letter would be intercepted . We have in no wise done wrong to any of the people , and if we are hemmed in and assaulted , we will die every man of us under the flag of his country . She began to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening of the second day a body of Mexican cavalry had come within a few hundred yards of the fort , that the Americans had waited in the thicket with their fingers on their triggers , ready to fire the first shots of the Mexican war . However , the Mexican cavalry had not attacked . At the end of the third day , convinced that they never would attack and confident that he had established his position and authority among the American settlers , Captain Fremont had withdrawn his party and moved slowly into Oregon . The next morning when she went to Secretary Buchanan 's office she found him looking harassed and pale . " We should never have allowed Captain Fremont to go to the Pacific coast at such a delicate time , " he said . " He has committed what amounts to a declaration of war on Mexico . He acted outside the pale of all legal and international rights . If his conduct starts a war with Mexico , he will have to take the full responsibility for it ; he had no orders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an embarrassing and painfulposition. "  |p126Jessie  shriveled . All she could whisper faintly was , " Is n't it true that President Polk has ordered General Zachary Taylor into the disputed territory around Texas , that he is now only a few miles from the Rio Grande ? " " Yes , but . . . " " I myself translated the dispatch for you which said that the Mexicans would consider this a declaration of war . The president 's action is far more likely to begin the war with Mexico than Captain Fremont 's resistancein California to what he called an insulting order . " " It is not Captain Fremont 's prerogative to decide when the United States has been insulted . That is the privilege of the State Department ! " He stopped abruptly , his round , doll-like eyes softened . " I am sorry , my dear Jessie : I did not mean to punish you for your husband 's conduct ; I know you are not responsible for what he does three thousand miles away . I think you will forgive me when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verge of resigning . I see war coming ; everyone around me is doing his best to force this war on Mexico when I know it is a detestable thing to do and will create the first black blotch on American history . Thank you for coming . I shall communicate with you in a few days . " She walked over to Secretary Bancroft 's office . Here she found an entirely different atmosphere , for Secretary Bancroft was delighted with the progress of events . " Yes , yes , I read the Union article , " he exclaimed . " I am glad Captain Fremont stood up to them . It was premature , it was indiscreet , and I assure you that I would not have had the courage to behave as he did without governmental orders in my pocket . Your husband is an impulsive man , Mrs. Fremont , perhaps even a little too impulsive ; but it is a quality for which I greatly admire him . His three-day rebellion will teach the Mexicans that we are not in a docile frame of mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cause a war ? " " No , the war will start over Texas , and I am the one who must take the responsibility for that . If you want to know what the administration thinks about the California episode , I have just been informed that PresidentPolk has promoted your husband to the rank of lieutenant colonel . " News from the West began to reach her more frequently . She watched the conquest of California unfold day by day , fitting the pieces of the story together from the American newspapers , the Mexican newspapers , the confidential dispatches to Secretary Buchanan , and the information which came to Senator Benton as chairman of the Military Affairs Committee . Because she had access to these combined sources of information , and because she saw much of this material before anyone else , she knew thatp127she was keeping closer to the conflict in California than anyone east of the Sierras . This gave her a sense of being by her husband 's side day by clay . Encouraged by Colonel Fremont , who was working behind the scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California staged the Bear Flag uprising and declared California a republic . When the settlers had their first battle with the Mexicans at San Raphael , Colonel Fremont stepped into command , but not before he had written out his resignation from the Army and dispatched it to Senator Benton to be published in the event his action embarrassed the government . He then captured San Franciscoon July 4 , formed the California Battalion of some three hundred men and , upon learning that war with Mexico had been declared some two months before , that fighting was going on in Texas and Mexico , seized all of central California . On July to Commodore Sloat of the United States Navy occupied Monterey , and Colonel Fremont moved his battalion in . Commodore Stockton , replacing the irresolute Commodore Sloat , swore Lieutenant Colonel Fremont and his battalion into the Navy and transported them to San Diego in the Cyane . From San Diego Colonel Fremont moved his men north toward Los Angeles , where a Mexican division was reported to be encamped , and rejoined CommodoreStockton near San Pedro . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot or without encountering the Mexican Army . Stocktonsent Colonel Fremont north to recruit another battalion and to commandnorthern California . During his absence the Mexican Army defeatedthe small American garrison and recaptured Los Angeles . There were several uneasy weeks while the Americans continued todefeated in southern California , but Jessie was encouraged by the that John had been able to organize a strong army which was marchingsouth , and that their old friend Colonel , now Brigadier General , Stephen Watts Kearny had left Santa Fe with three hundred volunteers , route for southern California . By January 9 , 1847 , the Americans hadIce again taken Los Angeles . Colonel Fremont accepted the surrender f the Mexican general Pico , gave him generous terms , and the war was ver in California . Now assured of her husband 's safety , Jessie was further delighted to learn that Commodore Stockton had named Colonel Fremont the first civil governor of California . Reports began to come through in the press f the generosity and efficiency of his rule , and everywhere people spokewith enthusiasm of the young colonel who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawings which John had sent cast after reaching California , cartographer Preuss had drawn a superb map of the compara- tively safe route to California which he had just established . When SenatorBenton presented the map to the Senate , he delivered a eulogy on Colonel Fremont which made Jessie , sitting in her accustomed seat in the gallery , swell with pride . In the middle of February , some twenty-one months after John had left Washington , she wrote a letter to her cousin Sarah Brant . In it she tried to explain the innumerable devices , fill-ins and fortitudes which she had used to somehow pass the time , explaining also the sense of being only fractionally alive when one can not hear the voice of a loved one , touch his hand , sec a look of understanding flash into his eyes . She ended on a cheerful note which looked toward the future : I feel that the honor to Colonel Fremont is but honor due for the arduouslabors he has performed and for his conspicuous bravery , and it is little enough reward for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult , indeed , dear cousin , for me to express my own happiness . Its warmth and light have driven all the chill and dark forebodingfrom my heart . My happiness gives me renewed strength and patience . Exactly a week later , when she was working at her desk in her sitting room , Josheem brought in a page from the State Department with a packet of Spanish letters . " If you will return at five this afternoon , " she told the page , " I will have the material ready for you . " She was skimming a long letter from Monterey which dealt largely with land grants when she suddenly sat bolt upright in her chair . The letter told of a quarrel which had arisen between Commodore Stockton of the Navy and General Kearny of the Army over the command and control of California . The letter ended with a sentence which the writer included as of only mild interest : " Colonel Fremont has been removed as commandant of California . " SHE WAITED WITH IMPATIENCE until Senator Benton returned at four o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him he would be as dumbfounded as she had been . Instead she saw her father flush , his eyes become watery . In a terrifying moment she thought , He knows about this ; then it must be worse than it appears in this dispatch . After a moment he said , " I heard of it in St. Louis when I was there last month . "  | " Why did n't you tell me ? " " I had hoped the trouble would blow over , Jessie . I had hoped that it was just a passing quarrel between General Kearny and Commodore Stockton . " " Has it blown over ? " " No . " She began pacing the room nervously . " But what could possibly have happened ? According to the reports John was doing a good job as governor . Why did they suddenly become dissatisfied ? " " It was not a question of his performance ; your husband got himself caught in a contest between the Army and Navy for authority over California . Commodore Stockton had orders to take and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the Mexicans surrendered , CommodoreStockton appointed Colonel Fremont as the governor . But GeneralKearny also had orders from Washington to assume the governorship of California , should he conquer and take possession of the country . " " But would n't Commodore Stockton 's orders be considered the valid ones , since the fighting was practically over by the time General Kearny got there ? " " Kearny fought one battle , a battle which he lost , by the way . However , the problem revolves about the question of who had the latest orders from Washington , Kearny or Stockton . " " Who did ? " " We 're not certain yet . In any event , General Kearny demanded that Colonel Fremont acknowledge him to be the commander in chief of California . John and his men were still serving under Stockton as part of the Navy , and so he declined to acknowledge Kearny 's authority . Kearny then moved his headquarters to Monterey , where he set up a civil governmentand declared Colonel Fremont to be deposed as governor , with no further authority . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this squabble ? " she asked with a heavy heart . " The Army and Navy belong to the same government , do n't they ? " Once again her father 's manner was evasive . He had been honest with his daughter for so many years that he found the transition difficult . " I have already spoken to the president . " " Yes ? " " He wants the men in California to settle this dispute among them-selves . " " Do you think they will ? " " There is certainly nothing in the argument that ca n't be settled . "  | Her peace shattered , Jessie impatiently edged through the weeks that followed , waiting for some word of how her husband was faring in the conflict . Her only momentary diversion was Eliza 's marriage ; Eliza had been so helpful during her own troubled courtship that she was happy to be able to stage a beautiful wedding for her older sister in the drawing room of the Benton home . Eliza wanted the affair to be a quiet one , but before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of necessity invite some two hundred people . The dinner which followed the ceremony was elaborate , for Jessie tried to duplicate for her sister the magnificentwedding dinner served at Cherry Grove . The preparations , the excitement , the visits to the dressmaker , the planning of the ceremony and dinner occupied her time for almost three weeks ; she was glad to be so exhausted by the end of the day that she could fall into a troubled sleep , She saw her sister and new brother-in-law off for a trip to New York , then bade good-by to her father , who was going to St. Louis on political business . At the front door he said to her : " Be of good courage , and take care of your health . " " I 'll do my best , Father , but it is this groping in the dark that has upset me . If only I could know what is going on out there . . . " Thomas Benton had a saying that good news travels on the swiftest horse , but bad news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the almost comfortable silence surrounding the events in California was split open . Her cousin Sarah sent her an anonymous letter published in the St. Louis Republican which mercilessly flayed Colonel Fremont for the part he had played in the conquest of California , challenged his motives , his character and his conduct , accused him of dictatorial methods , willful insubordination , usurpation of authority , and conduct detrimentalto the welfare of the Army . This then was what George Bancroft had intimated ; the Army was in process of disavowing Colonel Fremont ! John had waged war successfullyand conquered central California . . . but without authorizationThe following day a similar clipping arrived from a friend who had cut it from the New York Courier and Enquirer . When practically th identical article arrived from the New Orleans Picayune , it became obviousto her that the indictments all had been written by the same hand . She now knew that the quarrel had not been settled in California , tha affairs were growing worse . She sat down to write a letter to her father telling him what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply on her sitting-room door and said her hand for the letter , tore it open and was plunged into the reading before Maylee could close the door behind ip131r . An enclosed dispatch to President Polk fell to the floor while she sickly scanned the opening paragraphs of affection , her eyes racing head to get to John 's statement of his trouble , his assurance that everything was working out well . He warned her to be prepared for a severe ' tack in the eastern papers , for Lieutenant Emory , General Kearny 's dispatch bearer to Washington , had left for the capital , and it was being nnored in California that he had been sent to undermine John 's positio-n . She sat reading his description of how California had been in American hands before General Kearny arrived on the scene ; during the final battles with the Mexicans , General Kearny had acknowledged that CommodoreStockton was commander of all American forces in California . owever , after John had signed the peace treaty with General Pico at Rancho , and Commodore Stockton had set him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had established his own headquartersthe Plaza in Los Angeles , proclaimed himself commander of all forces n California , ordered both Commodore Stockton and John to step k ) wn , to issue no more orders or appointments without his sanction . Commodore Stockton refused to accept General Kearny 's authority ; John Aso refused to be deposed . He had gone to General Kearny 's headquartersthe next morning to tell him that until the Army and Navy had adjusted their difficulties in California , and the supreme authority had IC en established by word from Washington , he would take his orders I ! om Commodore Stockton and retain his position as governor of California . The scene had been a bitter and violent one . General Kearny nd then moved his troops to Monterey . John was still governor in southrnCalifornia , but there was no one to sustain his authority . She did not close her eyes all night , but lay awake in the candlelight lading and rereading the letter from John , almost memorizing the wordslove . In her mind she formulated the best method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a written authorization Dr Colonel Fremont to remain as governor of California . Visitors were not permitted at the White House until one o'clock , so be had ample time in which to make the most meticulous toilet . She donned a green cashmere gown , spent a long while brushing her hair , Ind on top of it , at a saucy angle , she perked a green corded hat . President Polk received her promptly at one o'clock with assuranceshis pleasure in seeing her . He broke the seal on Colonel Fremont 's dispatch and read it quickly . As Jessie saw him lift his eyes from the last r rd , she asked with a rush of emotion : " Mr. President , does n't Colonel Fremont 's course seem reasonable under the circumstances ? "  |p132There  was no doubt in her mind that he would reply at once , " Entirely reasonable , Mrs. Fremont ; I shall send a dispatch which will clear up the situation and leave Colonel Fremont in command as civil governor . " But no word came from President Polk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then looked up at her with a nonco mittal expression . " The misunderstanding may be settled by now , Miss Jessie . In th. case , there would be no need for any of us to take sides . " She saw that the President had terminated the interview . A feeling frustration arose , then a calm seized her . " Mr. President , I do not expect you to side against General Kearny I only beg you to assure me that Colonel Fremont will not be victimize. by the quarrel between the Army and Navy . General Kearny is threaten ing to relieve him of command of his California Battalion . " " Miss Jessie , I think we can do that much to put your mind at ease , ' replied the president , slowly . " I will send a dispatch giving Colonel Fr mont the right to remain on duty in California or to join his origin . regiment of mounted rifles in Mexico if he prefers . " " Thank you , Mr. President . That is the fair and equitable thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jessie assuring th President of the United States that he was doing the fair and equitable thing . He then shook her hand , sent his compliments to her father an . walked with her to the door of the reception room . THERE- WAS LITTLE she could do now but sit back and wait . A few da later her father returned from St. Louis and asked her to take a walk wi him along the Potomac . " I am sorry that I must be the one to break this to you , Jessie , yet . your father I suppose it is best . Things in California have come to a most - unfortunate pass . " Jessie stopped . She turned to confront her father , who loomed big b. fore her . Even in her anxiety she had time to notice how old he was look ing : his thinning hair was completely silver , his eyes had a tired and corn miserating expression , the flesh wrinkles at the bridge of his nose seemed tightly lined . " General Kearny ordered John to bring his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a wild horseback ride up to Mon terey where a most unfortunate scene took place . General Kearny r-P133sled the latest order giving him command , and Colonel Fremont went back to Los Angeles , followed by several of Kearny 's officers , all of them antagonistic to your husband . There were quarrels and recriminations untilfinally . . . " " Yes ? " One corner of Tom Benton 's mouth fell loose , as it always did when he labored under heavy personal emotion . " Colonel Fremont has been relieved of his command . He was ordered back to Washington . " A thin smile came over her tired face . " Then he is coming home ! At least I shall see him again . We will be able to work this out together , all of us . " Her father took her arm and began walking along the riverbank . Jessie tried to watch his eyes , but he was turned so she could not see him too closely. " . . . you do n't understand , my dear : Colonel Fremont . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest . " Jessie got home as quickly as possible , refused dinner and went straight to bed , lying as still and lifeless as a corpse . John coming home under arrest ! After all his accomplishments , after all the magnificent promise for the future , he was being dragged across the continent like a prisoner , in disgrace ! George Bancroft had intimated that if the capture of California were successful , anything her husband might have been required to do would h ( ' forgotten . California was in American hands , war had been waged officially with Mexico , and there had been no international scandal . Then why were they visiting upon him the punishment which had been promised only if he failed and embarrassed his government ? She began to thrash about in the bed , turning , twisting , matching with her movements the turnings and twistings of her mind as she sought some way out of the hopeless trap . Why had John quarreled with GeneralKearny ? Was it because he had started the war in California withoutauthorization ? Or was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her head and burst into weeping , giving vent to all of the fears and misgivings of the past months , months during which site had maintained her self-control with an iron discipline . Suddenly she found herself picked up , the blanket over her head , and miraculously was sitting on her father 's lap . " Here , drink this , " he said . " It is warm milk and rum . Do you know what time it is , child ? Two in the morning . I went down into the kitchen and warmed the milk ; drink this now . It will put you to sleep . " " And may I ask what you were doing until two in the morning ? "   " You may ask . I was writing a stiff letter to President Polk , summarizingthe case and demanding an investigation . I assure you there is nothing to worry about , Jessie . We will bring all the facts to the light , and when we have done so , Colonel Fremont will be vindicated . " " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made me drowsy . I think I can fall asleep now . " She spent the intervening weeks , before John could reach Washington , in a state of suspension , giving in neither to despair nor sanguinary hope . She knew that she and her husband faced a difficult time . She knew that they could not come out of the contest unscathed . She knew that the comingmonths would demand the most of their faith in themselves and their loyalty to each other . At the end of August the long vigil was ended . She was sitting in th bow of the drawing-room windows watching out over C Street when she saw a carriage turn Pennsylvania Avenue on two wheels and dash up to the Benton home . Out sprang a young man in a faded blue army uniform . He turned and spoke to the driver about his luggage , giving Jessie time to run through the hall , fling open the door , and welcome home her husband after two years and three months of absence . Unashamedly in the open doorway she clung to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many , many times . But even at this first numb moment of joy she perceived that her husband was not responding . She took his hand and led him to the drawing room , then stood gazing at him . Her heart sank : this was only the shel of the man whom she had sent forth with such high hopes more than two years before . It was not merely that he was cadaverously thin , his hair long and unkempt ; his eyes were those of a stranger , of a man des perately ill . The John Fremont she had sent away on his third expedition was a man of charm , of grace and poise , a man who knew his world an , not only loved it but commanded it . This gray-haired and sunken-cheekes person before her stood awkwardly , his arms not seeming to fit into thei , sockets , his torso twisted at an ugly angle , his legs slumped within the discolored trousers , his face at war with itself , the mouth taut , awry , the features twisted . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ble body and spirit that had forced a passage in the winter-locked Sierr. where no other man could have survived ; that this was the powerful ye quiet and graceful one who was beloved by Kit Carson and the frontiers men of America . For this man who stood before her was no leader , no strong one ; thi was a man profoundly hurt , caught at his most vulnerable spot , disorgan ized , frightened , unbeautiful and ineffective . His skin , his manner , hip135whole expression was bleak . Jessie remembered the night when John Fremont had put himself through the agony of revealing his illegitimacy to the woman he loved . Then , too , he had been awkward and disjointed . She could tell by every discordant line and knot of him that he felt humiliated , defeated . Above all , he was angrily and bitterly ashamed . She brought him a drink , ran her fingers through his long , shaggy hair , smoothed the whorls of black beard with the gentlest touch of her fingertips ; she kissed the bloodless lips and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did not let him see that she was alarmed . Her task was to bring him back to himself , to revive his courage , his faith . It was a moment in their marriage that she must handle with sensitivity and tenderness ; if she succeeded now she could serve at his side to the end of his days . What happened later was of little importance : he must be made whole . id well again . If she could do that they could triumph over their difficulties . She sensed that he was frightened of her reception , afraid that she might censure or condemn him , believe him to have been hotheaded , blundering , stupid . She knew that this would have been the worst blow of all to him , and from his withdrawal , his refusal to come to her , she saw that he had already built up his defenses of cynicism and indifference . There had been no word from him , or any caress ; he had not told her how happy he was to see her or how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such terms . " Why has General Kearny done this to us ? " she asked . " What is the meaning behind it all ? " John did not reply to her question , but began talking disjointedly. " . . . refused to let me join my regiment in Mexico . . . did n't let me get my notes or journals in San Francisco . . . any of my scientific instruments or specimens that I collected for two years . . . had plans to arrest me for six months , but did n't give me five minutes ' warning . . . made me trail behind him across the Sierras and Rockies like a servile Indian or a common criminal . . . heaped indignities . . . degraded me in front of my own men . . . deprived me of the privileges of my lank ... " " But now that you are back in Washington , what does General Kearny plan to do ? " John bolted to his feet and thrust his head upward belligerently . " Court-martial . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! "   Her breathing stopped . Her mind flashed back to the scene with Colonel Kearny four years before . At last her chickens had come home to roost . This court-martial was the logical culmination of the long line of events that had transpired since that fateful moment in St. Louis when she had torn open an order from the War Department and concealed it in her sewing basket . P137SHE DID NOT WANT ANYONE to see her husband while he was in his present condition , yet there were few places they could go where Colonel Tremont would not be recognized . She thought of Francis Preston Blair 's estate , Silver Spring , which lay just outside the District of Columbia , but she had no desire to go there if the Blair family were present . While John was resting she sent Josheem by horseback to Silver Spring with a note . He returned later that evening with a letter from Mr. Blair saying that by a happy coincidence he and his family were leaving for St. Louis the following day , and he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spring as she liked . She now had the more difficult task of convincing her husband that for a short time at least he should step outside the arena , let the battle wait . She could tell by his every nervous gesture and intonation that he was spoiling for a fight ; she also knew him well enough to realize that he would be least effective if he ventured forth now . After a quiet dinner in their apartment she waited for a suitable moment and then said : " Darling , the good book of matrimony preaches that when a husband and wife have been separated for twenty-seven months , they have a right to demand a honeymoon . " He was not amused by her oblique approach . He looked up sternly , muttering : " Honeymoon ! At a time like this ? How can you even think , Jessie . . We have a whole case to prepare . . . " " I 'm looking forward to working with you , John , but please , not just yet . Does n't love have any rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there is a time for . . . " " Why are n't you entitled to a couple of weeks ' vacation after you have been in harness for two and a half years ? Even the government would n't begrudge you that , hardhearted as it may be . You 're so tire . and worn , sweetheart ; two weeks of rest and you would feel like a different man . " " I do n't want to feel like a different man , I 'm satisfied with the old one . Besides , I 'm not tired and I 'm not worn , I 'm just determine . She rested her head on her arms . " Very well , if you insist on my telling the truth : I 'm the one who worn . I was brave when you came home from the other expeditions . did n't cry on your shoulder or fill your ears with how much I had suf fered or how tired I was . Now did I ? " " No , you 've always been brave . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I feel exhausted after th  --  long months of waiting for you . By the Eternal , if I do n't have you t. myself for a few days I just ca n't face the long ordeal . I know that it ' weak of me , and that I should n't add my burdens to yours . . . " His expression lightened . " But what do you propose ? Where could we go ? " " Francis Preston Blair has offered us refuge at Silver Spring . We won ' tell anyone where we are going , and we 'll have complete seclusion . It will be wonderful to become acquainted all over again . " Since Josheem had carried the note to Silver Spring the day before they let him drive them in the carriage the next morning , warning hi that he was to tell no one where he had been . They rode through rows of tall pines , chestnuts and oaks , then crosses a stone bridge and drew up on a triangular roadway before a rambling house with a wide front porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them comfortable in the guest suite assured them that they woul. have privacy . Jessie did not wait for their suitcases to be unpacked but urged Joh to take her for a long walk through the estate . Francis Preston Blair had supported Van Buren for the presidency , arriving in Washington in 1836 with a family of three sons and a daughter . He founded the Globe , which became one of the outstanding newspapers in the country , rapidly becomingrich on its proceeds and on the benefits of governmental printing contracts . With his first affluence he had bought the wooded acres of Silver Spring . Jessie and her husband walked past the Acorn summerhouse and vegetablegardens , turned down the Lovers ' Walk which followed the streamP139almost to the Potomac , then entered the forest where the hot August sun was blocked out . They relaxed in the cool green darkness . They walked for almost three hours , resting frequently in the bowers and grottoes which Francis Blair had built along his many gravel-lined trails . Determined as she was not to think about their troubles until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a complication she could not drive out of her mind ; the War Department had decreed that the trial must be held at Fortress Monroe , an island off the coast of Virginia . John would be held almost incommunicado ; it would be difficult to find a lawyer who would be able to isolate himself on the island for several months ; in all likelihood the proceedings would be secret , and newspapermenbarred from the fortress ; there would be no way for the Fremonts to present their case to the public . Tom Benton was working with all his might to get the trial transferred to Washington . Time enough to tell her husband about Fortress Monroe , from which even she would be excluded , if the senator 's efforts failed . When Josheem brought a letter from her father she scanned it eagerly for news of the removal of the trial to Washington , but there was none . I have a full view of the whole case , Kearny 's as well as yours , and I ( 1m perfectly at ease . Your husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutors will be covered with shame and confusion . The process through which the colonel has gone is bitter ; but it will have its sweet . You both will realize the truth of what Lord Palmerston said to Van Buren when he was rejected by the Senate : " It is an advantage to a public man to be , in the course of his life , the subject of an outrage . " They had complete quiet , yet Jessie perceived that the beauty of Silver Spring , its air of seclusion and peacefulness , was lost upon John . His spirit was in turmoil and he did not know where he was . She talked to him quietly , trying to analyze not the case itself nor the troubles in California , but his feeling about them ; for she had to know what he was thinking in order to work with him . He was torn by humiliation and rage , hut above all she saw that his attitude was dominated by the idea that he was being persecuted . " They never wanted me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , that West Point clique . They were just waiting for the best hour to strike . They let me get so far , and only so far , and then they conspiredto knock me down . I told you before we were married that they would never give me any permanent peace , but only a truce . I signed more than half a million dollars ' worth of notes in California for horses and supplies , but General Kearny laughed at the people who trusted my signature , told them my notes were practically worthless . It is a con- spiracy to keep me from returning to California . We 'll never be able to live on that beautiful Santa Cruz ranch I bought with our savings . " While he recounted the indignities that had been heaped upon him she slowly understood that these slights had come to have more importance for him than the basic dispute in California . When she saw how ill he was in his mind she cried to herself , What have they done to him ? How am I going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bring him back to health so that no matter what the outcome of the courtmartialhe will be strong and resolute in the face of it ? She thought shrewdly that everything that happens in a marriage , both for good and evil , is not only implicit but actually revealed in the courtship . There were no surprises in marriage , only the working out of everythingone has dimly perceived during the process of becoming acquainted . If she had stopped to analyze things then she could have predicted not only the nature of her happiness but the outlines of her troubles as well . She approached the rebuilding of her husband scientifically . She had never had any intention of being an amateur wife , for she had little enjoymentof amateur talent ; she had meant to be a professional wife ; one who used the same degree of skill as any serious practitioner of an art or science . Her problems up to this moment had been comparatively simple : to sustain herself while her husband was on his long voyages ; to protect his interests in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reports which were so important in spreading knowledge of his work and of the West . The serious element now was the one that lay submerged and ever ready to spring : his obsession with his own illegitimacy and the danger it created because of the sense of insecurity it bred within him . She spent sleepless hours during the long nights wondering what method she could best use to elicit the full story from him without causing a continuous uproar or protracting his bitterness as he relived the events . They were nerve-racking days , for no word or gesture could be accidental , spontaneous . Each step had to be planned , integrated , tested ; any slip could tear down hours of work . She needed art in handling the situation , all the art that ever a wife needed , all the accumulated skill that wives the world over have needed to help their husbands . If the task seemed difficult , exhausting , she knew that it was not unselfishness on her part , but intelligent self-interest . Everything that happened to John must of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease to be purely themselves but step into a new and expanded character , the character of their marriage . It was not possible for either of them to do a misguided act without injuring the creation , the third being , which resulted from their having put their lives together : the child that was born of the mat-P141ing of their temperaments before any child could be born of the mating f their loins. it was too early for her to think logically about the facts ; she went long with John emotionally , agreeing with his attitudes , accepting what it said as the truth , asking only those questions which would lead to the further sustaining of his position , using no method of analysis with whichachieve perspective . For she conceived it to be her function not to am an acquittal of the charges , but to put her husband in a frame of rind to acquit himself to advantage in the courtroom , to appear at his lost before the nation during the trial . For herself , she had not time yet o decide whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to hold her sympathies for her husband while keeping her mind open . What had ten done in California had been done ; although the action there could is interpreted in different ways , none of it could be changed . For the moment she could do a better job as a wife , acting as a complete partisan n her husband 's side . As a wife she could only influence the result by working to keep her husband balanced , his poise unshatterable , his attitude toward the proceedings respectful but penetrating ; later perhaps he could be the strategist seeking to set up the best possible case for her pent . In her sympathy for the man she loved she could not do otherwise . She used every art and guile known to the heart of woman to nurse him to health . As they rode Francis Blair 's spirited horses through the rests she challenged him to race with her , complimented him on how beautifully he sat the horse . Sitting before the warmth and bright red flames of the fireplace she played up the hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which he had appeared to the best dvantage , filled him with her pride in his accomplishments . She showed hn the accumulation of honors that had come to him while he was away : c Founder 's Medal of the National Geographical Society of London , e gold medal from Baron Humboldt , awarded by the Prussian governtiltfor his contribution to science : read him articles from such magatiesas the Southern Literary Messenger , the Electric Review and the emocratic Review , in which it was declared that the name of John Fremont was immortalized , that his accomplishments were greater than those of Lewis and Clark , that he should be compensated as they had , pith large land grants and double pay . She turned the pages of her scrapbookin which she had pasted the stories of his achievements from the newspapers and magazines of Britain and Europe . She concurred withmotives even when she was not able to follow his reasoning . She aycd the temptress , wearing her loveliest gowns , using her most delicate perfumes , shamelessly arousing his sexual love for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and potent force between them . " There were moments when she thought she was making headway , when a flash of humor would illuminate his remarks , but these successes were momentary and all too soon he slipped back into the pattern of his illness : his overstatement of his own importance , his conviction that everything he had done was right , that he could n't possibly have mad . even one mistake during the harrowing circumstances ; his lack of sym pathy or tolerance for his opponents while decrying their lack of sympa thy and tolerance for him ; his discounting of his own impetuousness , h ' irritability with restraint , his tendency to act on his own . When everything looked hopeless because , no matter how subtly she tried , she could not set his perspective straight , she indulged in a melodramatic scene in which she wept bitterly , showed herself to be weak an . frightened . She did not have to pretend , for deep in her heart she felt weak and frightened . Ashamed at last , realizing something of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms around her , kissed her tears upward alon : . her cheeks , drying his lips in the hair of her temples . " Do n't cry , dear , " he murmured , " it 's not that bad . We 'll work it out we 'll defeat them , now do n't you worry about it . " One evening toward the end of the second week , knowing that the had only a few more hours on what she called their happy island sur rounded by a sea of troubles , they had the horses saddled and rode ove to Miss English 's Academy . It was a full moonlit night , the countryside bathed in a white and powdery fluorescence . They tied the horses to the mulberry tree and stood holding hands while they gazed up at her win dow . " Do you remember how you hid your first letter in the wash basket ? ' " I remember . " " What would you have done if Mammy had n't come along at just th. right moment with that bundle of wash ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock and thrown it throug your window . I was an irrepressible youth , Miss Jessie ; I should hay . pursued you and thrown rocks through your window until you were eighty . " " How nice . just think of all the time I was smart enough not to waste Do you think you could climb up this mulberry tree without tearing you lovely breeches ? " Without waiting for an answer she pulled herself up into the tre-e climbed quickly among the familiar branches and then sat in the nook where she and John had first talked . It was only an instant before shp143saw his head appear between the branches . The moonlight on his hair made it seem silvery ; instead of being projected back to their first meeting , she saw how he would look thirty years hence when his hair and beard would be white . He pulled himself up and sat beside her . " I have had exciting news this morning , Lieutenant Fremont : my roommate Harriet Williams is going to be married to Count Bodisco . Would you come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive an invitation . " " I was just writing to Harriet when your note arrived in the wash basket . I 'll ask Harriet to have the count send you an invitation . Do you like to dance , Lieutenant Fremont ? " He put his arm about her and lifted her half out of the juncture of the limbs , until she was lying against his chest , her cheek on his , the corners of their mouths touching . " Ah , Jessie , " he whispered , " a good marriage is truly a miracle . " ON THE DAY her father was due back from St. Louis , Jessie donned one tof her new house gowns which she wore high at the throat , finished with small flat collar of lace , and went down to the drawing room to await is arrival . The hours passed and Senator Benton did not come home . inally she saw him striding down C Street from Pennsylvania Avenue , is big frame swinging along quickly and confidently . She could tell by is manner that he bore good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cr a bearlike hug was : " I 've been to the War Department . The trial has been transferred to the Arsenal Building in Washington . I showed them what the publicAuld think if they dragged a man all the way from the Pacific Ocean to a secret trial in the Atlantic Ocean . Now I 'll be able to attend the trial myself . " A surge of relief swept over her . She kissed her father 's cheek , commented on the fact that he needed a shave , and then said , " So far so good . Now there 's just one more thing we need to do . " " What is that ? " " Have the court-martial stopped altogether . Colonel Fremont was acting under secret orders from President Polk : why else should Captain ontgomery of the S.S. Portsmouth have provided him with money , unitions and medical supplies to start the war in California , and ConIsLarkin and Leidesdorff help him to organize the campaign ? If thep144president ca n't reveal these secret orders , then at least let him tell everybodyinvolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , Jessie , " cried Tom Benton . " It 's too late now to try to hush up the affair . Too many of General Kearny 's officers have been writing articles in the newspapers attacking John . If we withdraw , everyone will say we 're guilty . We want this court-martial ; the best way to prove the colonel 's innocence and justify him is a public trial here in Washington . We 'll use it as an open forum to tell the whole world of his accomplishments . You will sec , Jessie , he will emerge as a greater man than ever . The administration will back us . . . " " Even if he were to win , " she replied quietly , " I still would n't think i was the wise thing to do . Father , wo n't you go to President Polk and ask him to call off the trial ? " Her father looked at her long and hard , then replied : " I ca n't do that , Jessie , but if your husband wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has said , I do n't think anything in the world could keep him from fighting this case in the open . " " I might be able to persuade him , " she replied . " Is there no one who can intercede to stop this court-martial without anybody losing face ? " " Yes , General Kearny . He is the only one . If he would withdraw hi charges . . . " " Then if you 'll excuse me , Father , I will dress at once and go to se him . Somebody must stop this dreadful quarrel . " She walked to the office which General Kearny occupied in the W Department on his trips to Washington , feeling as gray and barren the grayish cubicle into which she entered . One look at the general 's it and aging face showed her that he too was suffering deeply . He rose fro his chair , stiffly , no sign of recognition or friendliness coming over hi sand-worn face , the eyes small and dull . She closed the door behind he and leaned against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kearny , no matter what has happened or will happen , I wan you to know that I regret this entire affair bitterly . " He made no reply ; she felt that he was probing her intent and woul make no move until he was sure of its nature . " There have been mistakes made , " she continued in a tight tone . " have come to ask you not to multiply those errors into misfortunes fo all of us . " After a painful pause he spoke : " Then you can see that Colonel Fremont made serious mistakes . " " I grant that , General . The only ones who do n't make mistakes in life are those who do nothing . "  | " Am I to understand that Colonel Fremont is prepared to make public apologies ? " Jessie flinched . She made her way uncertainly to a hard wooden chair , sat on its very edge . " I do n't know , General Kearny ; I am here without his knowledge . " " Then why did you come ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict . Nothing can come of it but grief for all of us . " " There will be no grief for me , Miss Jessie : I am the commanding officer whose orders have been thwarted . Your husband caused me untolddifficulty in California . Now it is his turn to suffer . " She rose from the sharp edge of the chair , went close to him . " He has already suffered ; more than you could possibly imagine . This court-martial will be tragic for him , but it will be equally tragic for you and everyone concerned . " " There you are wrong ; I have nothing to conceal ; no discredit can possibly fall upon me . " " Please forgive me , General , if I am so presumptuous as to contradict you : I know the nature of the charges that will be hurled , both by you against my husband and by my husband against you . " In spite of her sincerity , General Kearny was offended . " If you are so sure he is right and I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Because I am convinced that in a case like this , even though everybudymay be right and nobody wrong , everyone must lose and no one can win . " " Have you seen the case against Colonel Fremont ? Do you know how ( Completely we can crush him ? Or have you been listening only to your husband 's version ? " " I have been listening to my husband 's version ; I am prejudiced in his favor , but that prejudice has not blinded me . I know how right you were , and  --  forgive me  --  how wrong , no , not wrong , but intolerant you were . 1 also know how wrong Colonel Fremont was ; no , not wrong , but rash and impetuous . But he is a younger man ; because of your friendship for our family you could have been like a father to him . Senator Benton and I could have expected that much of you . " " My obligations to the Army come first , Mrs. Fremont . We play no favorites and allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But surely you are exaggerating the importance of Colonel Fremont and his conduct . " " I know your father is outraged with me , Miss Jessie ; and please believethat I have loved you almost like a daughter . I am deeply regretful of the pain I must inflict on you . But Colonel Fremont insulted me in the presence of other officers ; he refused to obey my orders and quarreled with my representatives . Mutiny is a habit of mind with Coionel Fremont . If I let this mutiny go by I will so have undermined my position that I will never again be able to command . I owe it to myself and my long career to punish this conduct . Colonel Fremont must not be allowed to get away with this second mutiny successfully , or he will establish a precedentwhich will injure the morale of the Army . " " Second mutiny ? What was the first . . . ? " " When he left Kaw 's Landing after having received the order to report back to Washington . " Jessie paled , began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , General Kearny . My husband never knew that order had been sent out , not until I told him about it upon his re-turn . " " Forgive me for being brutal , " replied General Kearny with the devastatingplainness of a sandstorm sweeping across the desert , " but I do n't believe you . I think he is the one who received the order and arranged this scheme with you to avoid its implications . " She stumbled back onto her chair . " How can you say that to me , when you have been a friend of the Benton family for forty years ? When you have known me since the day I was born ? " " That is the very reason I say it . The Bentons have always been passionatepartisans , putting the cause above the truth . I know that you would lie to defend your husband , Jessie : I know there is nothing in the world you would n't do to protect him . I do n't speak critically when I say that you lie ; it is a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect her husband . But that is no reason for me to be deceived . Your husband is a confirmed mutineer . The sooner we get him out of the Army , the better . " " Very well , then , " said Jessie , hardly recognizing the metallic tone of the voice she somehow managed to project . " I am a liar and my husband is a congenital mutineer . Even so , must all the world hear our charges and countercharges ? It will hurt the administration , it will hurt our government , it will hurt our army . " " I shall insist upon the court-martial , " he replied hoarsely , " because I will allow no one to do this to me at the end of my career . " " Then I can answer with equal truth that you must not do this to yourselfat the end of your long career ! The bitterness of the trial , the accu-1 sations will make you enemies and obscure what you have done for your country . "  | " I will take my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself derelict duty if I failed to prosecute this case . " There was an awkward silence . Finally Jessie pleaded , " Why must you revenge yourself on him because of me ? I was responsible for Colonel remont 's leaving with your cannon , against orders . If not for that trouble you would never have thought of him as a mutineer . You would have been more patient and kindly with him in California , forgiven his brashnessand concealed his refusal to obey . But because of what I did in St. Louis you were already set in your mind to think of him as rebellious . I m the one who is responsible for your state of mind . And if my husband i retired from the Army in disgrace it will be my fault . Would you makeresponsible for destroying my own husband ? I can not believe that f you . Submit your report to the War Department ; let the War Departlenttake whatever disciplinary action it sees fit ; but do n't make this matter of public scandal . Give me time to reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will see what mistakes he made and rill come to you with his apologies . " General Kearny turned from her and stared unseeing at the blank ray wall . When he turned back his eyes were as blank and gray as the falls at which he had been looking . " I ordered Colonel Fremont to come to Monterey and bring his archives ; this , after four months in which he kept himself in command in southern California against my direct and explicit orders . He came into Ry headquarters at Monterey unkempt and disheveled after a four-hundred-mile dash on horseback , still having disobeyed my orders and having brought his records . Colonel Mason was with me . Your husbanddemanded that I dismiss Colonel Mason from our presence , so thatcould talk to me privately . When I refused , he shouted , Did you bring ni to spy upon me ? ' Please believe me , Mrs. Fremont , I know of no equivalent of that scene in all army history . Later , when I sent Colonel to Los Angeles to take over Colonel Fremont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanding officer to a duel ! c was so arrogant and contemptuous of my command that he refused tourn to me the two howitzers I had brought across the desert from Santa c , and which the Mexicans turned over to him when they surrendered . This is chaos , Mrs. Fremont . Ca n't you understand that ? How could I k , anything else but put him under arrest ? " Jessie dug her short nails into her palms . Now both of the mutinies d the Fremont family centered around howitzers ; for it was obvious runt General Kearny 's critical attitude and tone of voice that he haden more deeply offended by Colonel Fremont 's refusal to return the cannon than by anything else in their conflict .   " He was overwrought from the months of conquest . If he had been ill in his body you would have seen that he got the best medical cares you would have nursed him with your own hands . But he was tired in hit mind , and for that kind of sickness you have neither understanding no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her gloves . " General Kearny , wh must you be so cold and hardhearted ? Why must you try to destro Colonel Fremont ? And me ? Why should you want to injure the cause o western expansion , to hurt my father ? You can not harm people who you love and not maim yourself along with them . " " If I had been afraid of mortal combat , Miss Jessie , I should never have become a soldier . " " But this is something infinitely worse than death : the same tar wit which you will cover my husband will cover you . " " My conscience would no more permit me to withdraw from this battle than it would have to withdraw from a battle against the British , th Mexicans or the Indians . There are fundamental issues involved her . issues more important than any one person or group of persons . Goo. day , Mrs. Fremont . " After leaving General Kearny 's office Jessie wandered slowly throug the streets of Washington . An hour later she found herself in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barracks to let her Ilea. clear . Then she picked herself up wearily and trudged homeward , asking Maylee to heat her some water for a hot bath . While sitting in the bi : iron tub , her knees drawn up under her chin , she utilized the quiet an . relaxation to review the morning . Yes , John had overstepped himself , his attitude toward Gener . Kearny appeared inexcusable ; but she would not try to post-guess hi To herself she said : Living in the security and comfort of my Washinton home , able to exercise the most beautiful hindsight , I could easil say that he should have done so and so . But in the heat of the excitemen with the future still an unwritten document , called on to make spli second decisions , what he did must have seemed right for him to do . that particular moment and under that particular set of circumstance It is easy enough to have good judgment after all the facts are in , but soldier is not a philosopher , he is a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adoring wife , but I certainly shall not sit in Olympian calm an . decide that I would have done it differently or better . As the steam from the hot water rose about her head and enveloped he in its mist she thought , We both have incipient mutiny in our blood : rebelled against the head of my school and her choice of a May Da Queen , leading my cohorts into the infirmary rather than letting theP149articipate . Seven years later I mutinied against the War Department . My husband rebelled against discipline and was expelled from school because as a romantic youth he preferred to roam the hills with his sweetcart . Twelve years later he too mutinied against the War Department . ' e are too much alike ; we double each other 's weaknesses . He should have married a different kind of woman , one who would never have interfered . . . who would have been a better balance wheel . . . In her own feeling of guilt she was not able to look too deeply into her husband 's guilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutiny goes long way . " Yes , too frequent mutiny would ruin not only the American tiny , but the American form of government which , resting upon the abnsent and co-operation of the governed , must also have the absolute obedience of the governed . It was very well for Vice-Admiral Nelson to Rise his blind eye to the spyglass when his inadequate commanding officer as giving a stupid and disastrous command , but what would happen if Vcry one of the thirty million Americans constituted himself a Lord Nelson , raising his blind eye to orders from Washington ? A co-operative government could survive mistakes and blunders in particular events , but t consistent disobedience . The government was the parent , the particula-r affair on hand the child ; if one child be lost , the fruitful parents can gate more children ; but if the child destroy the parent , the family is destroyed . Thus she came to feel that although her revolt had been justified in everything John had accomplished , in the gathering of the scientific data the further opening of the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have gathered the data ; the historical forces , of bleb he was only an instrument , would have opened the West . She had struck a great blow for her husband and his work , but when a blow is lick for someone , it must be struck against someone as well . That somehadbeen the American form of government , for which her grandotherMcDowell had carried a scar on her forehead all her life . LIZA AND WILLIAM CAREY JONES came in for dinner that night . That were happy together Jessie knew from little hints that Eliza had let tip ; but there was nothing in the undemonstrative manner of either to d i t ate that there had been any change in their lives . Jessie managed to ( . l ) the conversation away from the trial during dinner , but when they Md adjourned to the drawing room for coffee , Thomas Benton launched Itoo a legal analysis of Colonel Fremont 's course in California , intermingledwith a tirade against General Kearny .   Jessie found her eyes glued to William Jones 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she felt that he disapproved of what was bet said . She had been so preoccupied with her own troubles that she h paid little attention to her new brother-in-law , but now she found hers studying him intently . He was tall and slender , with cool green ey . a turned-up nose , a shock of blond hair which stood up straight , a an ascetic , almost beardless face . He had a quiet and reserved mann of speaking : she admired his calm , unhurried , unemotional nature ; herself could never aspire to this type of temperament , yet she knew worth . Mr. Jones 's position in this family difficulty was not yet clear ; had not discussed the case with him , nor had he volunteered any opinio She knew that he could be valuable to their cause , not only because would remain quiet and logical in the face of her husband 's and fathe hurricanes , but also because he was a student of international law . Jo Fremont and Tom Benton would fight in terms of personal conflict , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the le .. imperatives . Her husband was no lawyer ; her father had not practic law for some twenty years . Later in the evening , while Eliza went up to visit with her mothJessiecreated an opportunity to talk with her brother-in-law . She did know whether she could speak to him frankly , for although he was now member of the family , he had given no indication of affection for anyo beside Eliza . For all she knew he might be entirely disinterested in t dispute . " Forgive me if I try to read your thoughts , " she said , " but it did setome that while Father was discussing the case , something in the back your mind was disagreeing . " After a moment of expressionless but not unfriendly silence , he replied " There is an old saying that in a lawsuit nobody wins except the lawye " And in this instance not even the lawyers can win ! I feel that Colo Fremont was right in what he did , that his conduct can be justified cause of the complicated circumstances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very thought of a public squabble . " " I must agree with you , Jessie . Things will be said in a spirit of wind ' tiveness and revenge which will be impossible to expunge from the histo record . " " But do you see any way of stopping the trial ? I 've already been ref by Father and General Kearny . " William Jones glanced at the other end of the room where John Tom had their heads together . " I 'm afraid we have to go through with it , Jessie . " " We ? "  | " Yes . I want to offer my services . I do n't know that I can be of any ' cat help , but i should be happy and honored if you will permit me to serve as co-counsel . " The welling up of her emotion was cut short by the matter-of-fact manner in which her brother-in-law had made his offer , an offer which would cost him months of hard work and neglect of his own practice . She as nonplussed to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same casual manner in which he would offer to bring her a demitasse . " It is extremely kind of you , " she said quietly . " My husband and father d I are all so emotional , we fly off the handle so easily . Wo n't you case try to hold us down ? If only you will stay calm and logical , we will ways have a solid legal base . Please do n't pay us the compliment of caring in our vices . " " I will be as I am , Jessie , " he remarked . " I can not be otherwise . " Senator Benton secured a second and last concession from the War department , the postponement of the trial for another month so that Colonel Fremont might gather his witnesses from the frontiers . Jessie was interested to watch the trial fought in miniature before the raring opened : their army friends , who had been visiting the house for stayed away ; naval officers with whom the Bentons had had only oderate contact became most friendly , called on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely right in support-g the navy command in California . When Jessie went to the War Department to secure copies of papers needed for the defense , she was sated politely but coolly and given no assistance . At the office of the cretary of the navy she was received with warmth ; the entire staff aided r not only in locating documents but in organizing and copying them . was extreme bad fortune that Secretary of the Navy Bancroft had been tit abroad as minister to England . George Bancroft should have been in Washington to defend them , though she realized that he would have been ble to do little : he had warned her that anything John might attempt in California would be his own gamble , that he would be obliged to deny that he had given encouragement to a campaign against the Mexicans ; and in any event , the Army would vehemently have denied that any order from the secretary of the navy constituted a valid defense for an army liter . The library of the Benton home was set up as a workshop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fire , while her husband and brother-in-law spread their papers over the map table . The lawyer sent his day making a detailed study of the records of all court-martials old in America up to that time ; Jessie spent her hours in the Library of Congress securing data , her mind going back to the years when she had been " pastured " there by her father while he attended the SenaFor her the most interesting period of the day was the evening , when they assembled in the library to instruct each other on their findings . jr was concentrating on only one aspect of the trial : the fact that Como dore Stockton was the legal and rightful commander in California t tween January and May 1847 ; Tom Benton was concentrating onlegal authority for the conquest and governing of California ; Willi Jones was concentrating on the trial framework and the laws of evidence Jessie 's task was to write the letters that had to go out to witnesses , extract and copy the orders which each man wanted to include in working brief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law with her father 's hotheaded denunciation of General Kearny a  --  every last one of his witnesses ; and to somehow keep her husband 's fai and confidence running strong and logical so that together they co build a foolproof case . She awakened early on the morning of the trial , November 2 , 184 and ran quickly to the window to see what kind of a day she was to ha The sun was already up , bright but not hot ; there was the crisp crac of autumn in the air . She had slept little the night before , but over th  --  light breakfast she assured her husband that she had slept the sleep confidence . She kissed him good-by with a firm embrace , saying , " Eve thing is going to come out all right . " " There is not the slightest doubt of it in my mind , " he replied , but s could see that he was sorely troubled . The men left early in Hassler 's Ark to round up the defense witness . Court was not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ r anxious that she emerge from her preparations looking serene and con dent . She had several obstacles to overcome : there were bluish rings tins her eyes , her temples were a greenish white , and her King George 's M was hard and prominent . She bathed her eyes with warm and then co water , massaged her face for a long time to bring back some blood a  --  color , then sat quietly brushing her hair . At ten-thirty she put on a wa wine-colored dress with hat and shoes of the same color . While she engrossed in her thoughts there was a light knock on the door , and Eli came in . She had on a black gown . Jessie gazed at her sister for a mome " Eliza , my dear , this is n't an occasion for mourning . " " Then you do n't approve of my black ? " " No , please put on your new dress , the lovely navy one . " At a little after eleven General Dix 's spacious carriage arrived wi Dix 's two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to t . Arsenal . They drove down C Street to Pennsylvania Avenue and th. turned left . Since this was the calling hour in Washington there wep153any carriages abroad , some of them on their way to the Arsenal , others it route to friends ' homes . Jessie saw a number of their family acquaintfleeswalking , and she returned their bows with a series of forced smiles ; with the hand that was out of sight she clung to Eliza . " Your fingers are ice cold and trembling , Jessie . Here 's the turn toward he Arsenal , you had better put on your gloves . " The Arsenal was a huge rambling wooden building painted a faded mustard color . As Jessie alighted she saw a large crowd of spectators fathered on either side of the entrance . A murmur went up as she stepped ut of her carriage , one which she felt was sympathetic . This told heren better than had the friendly tone of the press for the past few days at the sympathies of the people were with Colonel Frernont . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high-domed riling with windows up toward the roof . There was room for only two hundred spectators , and guards were already barring the doors because very seat was occupied . Clasping Eliza 's arm , Jessie walked down the rater aisle with every pair of eyes fastened upon her . She took her seat inc front row of spectators just behind the railed enclosure inside of which , t a long mahogany table to the left , sat her husband , her father and her other-in-law , and on the opposite side the prosecuting attorney and his assistants . Since there was to be no jury at this trial , a duplicate jury box id been built on the left side of the enclosure , and here sat Kit Carson , Alexander Godey , and a large number of John 's California Battalion and associates in California who had come to testify . In the opposite box near u  --  prosecutor sat a bolt-upright array of army officers banked silentlyhind their commanding officer , General Stephen Watts Kearny . In thefront row across from Jessie was the phalange of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most dramatic army trial since General Wilkinson 's , thirty years before . " The sympathy of those in the courtroom heartened her . Then the thirteen judges , comprised of generals , colonels , majors , a captain , filed in , their uniforms resplendent with gold braid . They took their seats on the di judges ' bench which ran almost the full width of the courtroom , their position ranging downward from the general to the captain . The urt was called to order , the preliminary ceremonials dispensed with and en , while she listened to the terrifying quiet of the courtroom , the arges were read against her husband . The critical hour of their lifetimed struck . HE STUDIED HER HUSBAND ANXIOUSLY when the court demanded bet her he had any objection to the judges . She had persuaded him to buy a new uniform for the trial and he appeared to her to be as trim and handsome as ever , with his flashing eyes and quick , expressive face , albeit more mature-looking because of his rapidly graying hair and the lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was poised and balanced for the long ordeal . According to the rule of court-martial the defense attorneys coul never address the court ; they could work up the legal points , but Colon Fremont alone could speak in the courtroom ; he alone could read th. arguments and papers that had been prepared during the arduous nigh of work ; he alone could cross-examine witnesses , make protests to th. court . This was a hardship , for it not only obliged the defendant to function in a field in which he was not trained , but also put upon him th. burden of appearing before the court with the legalistic phlegm of th lawyer who has only a single decision at stake . She watched her husband rise and read in a clear , charged voice th paper on which they had worked the night before . " Mr. President : In preferring the usual request to be allowed couns in this case , I wish to state that it is no part of my intention to make defense on any legal or technical point , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the case . With this view , no objection wi be made to the relevancy or legality of any question proposed by the - prosecution or the court ; nor to any question which goes to show m motives , either by words or acts ; nor to the authenticity of any evidence written or printed , which I know or believe to be authentic . In this way t hope to facilitate the progress of the trial , and enable the court the sooner to obey the feelings which call them to a very different service . I name . the counsel allowed me the two friends who accompany me , Thomas H Benton and William Carey Jones . " She flashed him an approving nod as he half turned to her while sitting down , but her heart was racing when the judge advocate rose to open case by reading a letter from Colonel Fremont to General Kearny of th United States Army . To BRIG . GEN . S. W. KEARNY , United States ArmySIR : I have the honor to be in receipt of your favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execution of orders which , in my capacity o military commandant of this territory , I had received from Commodor Stockton , governor and commander-in-chief in California . I avail mysel of an early hour this morning to make such a reply as the brief time allowed for reflection will enable me . I found Commodore Stockton in possession of the country , exercisingP155the functions of military commandant and civil governor , as early as July last year ; and shortly thereafter I received from him the commission of military commandant , the duties of which I immediately entered upon , ltd have continued to exercise to the present moment . I found also , on y arrival at this place some three or four days since , Commodore Stock-n still exercising the functions of civil and military governor , with the time apparent deference to his rank on the part of all officers , including ourself , as he maintained and required when he assumed in July last . learned , also , in conversation with you , that , on the march from San liego , recently , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plying an acknowledgment on your part of supremacy to Commodore Stockton . I feel myself , therefore , with great deference to your professional and personal character , constrained to say that , until you and Commodore Stockton adjust between yourselves the question of rank , where I respectlilythink the difficulty belongs , I shall have to report and receive orders , heretofore , from the Commodore . With considerations of high regard , I am your obedient servant , J. C. FREMONT , Lt. COI . U.S.A.Military Commandant of theTerritory of California . As simple and respectful as the letter sounded she felt with a quick flash at herein lay the crux of the case which the Army would present , the al point around which the conflict and confusion would center : the court would decide who had been the legal commander of California ! If were Commodore Stockton , then Colonel Fremont would be declared innocent of the charges . If it were General Kearny , then he was guilty of disobeying the orders of the army officer . All of the thousands of wordst would be spilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even ore in hot blood , would revolve about this one point . The prosecutor proceeded to charge Colonel Fremont with twenty-two specifications " of mutiny , disobedience of lawful command and conduct the prejudice of military discipline . For four solid hours she heard theagainst her husband pile up until the prosecution had presented the most formidable body of charges brought against an officer since the trial Aaron Burr for treason . As an ominous and crushing rehearsal for all Ott vs as to follow during the three feverish months of claims and counter- , accusations and counteraccusations , the judge advocate drove into her consciousness by accusing her husband of : breaking his word to the Mexican authorities , cruelly and shamefully abusing the Californios and antagonizing them against the American govern- ment ; taking their horses and provisions and paying for them not in cash but in promissory notes ; leading a body of well-armed troops into a countryon the pretext of scientific survey and rising in arms against that country because it had ordered him out of its boundaries ; instigating the American settlers to rise against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of surprise attacks , assuming full authority over northern California and the supplies and ammunitions of America battleships in San Francisco Harbor without written authority to do so granting peace terms to the Mexicans without conferring with a superio in command . He had refused to return the two howitzers captured fro General Kearny at San Pascual ; refused to acknowledge the authority General Kearny , giving orders to recruit more troops for his Californi Battalion after the general had commanded him to cease ; he had tried t make a bargain with General Kearny for the governorship of Californi had turned against him only when his demands were refused , instructing his civil officers in California to regard General Kearny 's orders as obsolet He had used insulting conduct to General Kearny before staff office illegally purchased supplies for his troops after having been suspended b General Kearny , illegally carried on a civil government and proclaime himself to be governor . By the time the court adjourned at four o'clock she was exhausted an numb with fear . How were they ever going to overthrow this tremendo body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensuing days t upset the dreadful charges , free John from them in the minds of th nation ? Official Washington suspected that there had been secret orders sent t Colonel Fremont , yet it would be as impossible to bring them up during this court-martial in vindication of her husband as it was to make the public at the time they had been sent to him through Lieutenant Gillespi The trial could only be bathed in a fog of innuendo : while ostensibly trying Colonel Fremont for mutiny against General Kearny , theactually would be prosecuting him for presenting the United States Ar as an implement of conquest . Since in their effort to clear the Army f the historic record they could call to trial neither Secretary Bancroft an the United States Navy nor the president and those of his cabinet me bers who had sponsored the forcible pre-empting of California , the would visit upon Colonel Fremont the full strength of their outrage wrath , build up the strongest personal case they could expound again him , disown him , convict him on the only charges they dared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that only Eliza and h husband were eating theirs . After she had successfully downed a cup hot black coffee , she broke the silence by asking : P157'Why have they the right to convict a man before he is tried ? Why is it just practice to throw up this terrifying screen of accusations before we : 14 enter a defense ? " " Do n't you worry about our defense , " boomed Tom Benton , angrily pushing away his plate . " If you think their list of fabrications against us is terrifying , wait until you hear what we will do to them . " essie turned an anxious face to William Jones , who was dispatching the last of his baked ham and sweet potatoes . He continued uninterrupted until his plate was clean , then wiped the corner of his mouth meticulously with his napkin , pushed back his chair , crossed one long bony knee over the other and spoke in a quiet voice . " It is entirely proper procedure . We can not enter a defense until the case against us has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all twenty-two of the specifications are rightfully lodged . If we grant the premise that Colonel Fremont was legally bound to obey General Kearny 's order of January 17 , then every move he made for the next ninety days was illegal . " " But he was not obliged to obey General Kearny , " cried Jessie , her emotion , like her stomach , rising into her throat . " Commodore Stockton refused to allow him to resign from the Navy . " Quite so , " murmured Jones . " I was merely stating the case for the Apposition . Now let us look at our case : if the colonel was right in obeyinge orders of Commodore Stockton because he had been sworn into the avy , then everything he did between January 17 and May 8 , when he as permitted to see General Kearny 's new and conclusive orders from ashington , was not only right and legal , but necessary to the fulfillmentf his duties as governor . He would have been derelict in his duty had he one less . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present t . While Jessie tried to quiet her feelings with a second cup of coffee , Tom Benton rose heavily from his chair and boomed : " If the worst comes to the worst , who is the Army convicting here ? Certainly not Colonel Fremont ! They will be convicting the Navy , trying a chastise the Navy with a backhand slap at an army officer . " " They 're not going to convict us , " cried Jessie . " Every last charge in at dreadful bill of particulars happened before Kearny received his conclusive orders from Washington in May . . . " William Jones , who had lighted a cigar and risen from the table , came her side . " Easy does it . We can only fight this case on the facts , not on our hypotheses of what lies behind those facts . I believe in our case . " She looked up at him with tears of gratitude in her eyes .   " Of course we believe in our case , " said Tom Benton . " But we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Come now , let us go to wo We can convince no one by merely reassuring ourselves . " " Please , not yet , Father , " begged Eliza . " It 's too soon after dinner . Come into the drawing room for an hour and let me play for you . Jes die it will do you good to sing a few ballads . " " Eliza is right , " announced her husband ; " we should all rest for an hour and talk of other things . " Jessie saw that John and her father resented this cool good sense , that they wanted to go upstairs and plunge into work immediately , not because they were short of time and could n't get everything done , but because it was intolerable to their impatient natures to be kept away even momentarilyfrom a refutation of the charges . Nevertheless she knew that her sister was right , and she walked across the hall into the drawing room with an arm tucked under her husband 's arm . At eight o'clock they went up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had always stood by the bookshelves was brought to the center of the room and an astral lamp placed at each end . Here the notes from the day 's proceedings were spread out , as we as the documents in John 's possession and the copies of official pape which they had made during the day . Jessie and John sat facing the wall , Tom Benton and William Jones opposite . At midnight they had their paper completed , a statement which exonerated John on every charge made against him that day by the judge advocate . Now , suddenly , they were hungry . " We did n't have any dinner , " exclaimed Jessie ; " at least we did n't eat any . All I can remember is that wonderful chocolate cake . Come along , we 'll ransack the kitchen ; there should have been some ham left over , and I 'll make a fresh pot of coffee . " " I feel considerably better , " announced her father . " I feel like an avenging angel who has demolished the forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if he too were feeling th upsurge of emotion which had engulfed them . " We have stated our case , " he said heartily , " and we 've stated it might well . " " Easy does it , " cautioned William Jones , lighting his second cigar o the evening , now that he again had a few moments to relax . " We mus beware of overoptimism , just as we had to beware of overpessimism a the dinner table . " " Oh come , William , " cried Jessie , amused that she had used he brother-in-law 's Christian name for the first time ; " it 's after midnight and we 're all tired and hungry and exultant . For a few moments let 's not beP159cautious , let 's be confident and happy . Let 's talk about that long row of old braid that sits up on that bench : did you ever see so many gorgeous : dorms ? They looked as though they were about to decide the strategy of Lundy 's Lane or Waterloo . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not be prejudiced gainst the court . I think we will get a fair trial . " " I 'm sure of it , " she cried , feeling carefree for the first time in days . " We 're also going to get a fair amount of ham . Look , Maylee baked an xtra one . John , you make the coffee ; William , slice a French bread ; ather , how about a little brandy to celebrate the successful conclusion of  --  ur first day's.work ? " He returned with a bottle of brandy . When the glasses had been filled , ' om Benton raised his in a toasting gesture and said , " To us . " " Yes , to us , " murmured Jessie . Going to her husband , she kissed him and said : " And to you , my dear . " ' THE FOLLOWING DAYS were bad ones : General Kearny , Lieutenant Emory and Colonel Cooke occupied the stand and built up detail by detail the edifice against Colonel Fremont . It was clear to Jessie that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unclothing a man in 1 public seemed to her a vicious and senseless one . As the trial progressed it was apparent how his difficulties had pyramided ; the moves he . had made over a period of three months resulted from his first decision to conquer California for the United States and command as governor , and inevitably had to follow . Judged individually , without reference to the original reasoning which had prompted them , the acts looked hasty , misguided , r , ish and quarrelsome ; anyone picking up a newspaper and reading a f ; i'en set of charges made by General Kearny , Lieutenant Emory or ColonelCooke would convict Colonel Fremont on the very face of things . Yet once the original premise was granted these acts followed logically ; anyfoiereading the full story would see that Colonel Fremont 's actions had to In judged as sequences rather than a group of isolated incidents . In all fairness to General Kearny , she perceived that the same was true of him : anyone reading a single day 's accusations against him would have had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , officious . It had arrived in California after indiscreetly sending back two thirds of Isis Mormon Battalion , had been defeated at San Pascual , had his two howitzers captured by the Mexicans , had to be rescued from annihilation Commodore Stockton ; he had played a subsidiary part in the lastP16o battles against the Mexicans in California ; he knew that Commodore Stockton had orders from Washington to set up a civil government and had named Colonel Fremont as governor ; despite this he had behaved like a martinet in brushing aside the commodore 's accomplishments , Colonel Fremont 's almost bloodless conquest of the territory and success . ful civil rule , and had suddenly decided that he would be the sole corn .. mander . Yet his conduct in relation to Colonel Fremont was inevitable i one granted the rightness of his original premise : that he had the late . order from Washington to rule California , that in refusing to accept h. authority Colonel Fremont had committed an act of mutiny . She spent a good deal of her time watching the faces of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick glances at the spectators wh. thronged in each day at noon to enjoy this dramatic conflict betwee two famous men ; she devoured the newspapers , cutting out the favorable - articles to show to her husband , but feeling depressed at the condemna tory ones , which she destroyed before he could stumble across them . On the morning of the twelfth day the judge advocate summoned Gen eral Kearny to the stand ; Jessie saw that his leathery face was sallow She thought how ill he looked , and had a moment of sympathy for th ' aging warrior who had chosen to fight in a court-martial instead of on battleground . This sympathy was dispelled when he accused Colonel Fre mont of destroying important papers . Jessie was glad to see her husban. jump to his feet to protest . General Kearny apologized , said that h : had n't meant to use the word destroy , but in his first accusation the ac cuser had set the tone of the trial . General Kearny told of how he had lee his troops across more than one thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thirst , how he had played an important part in subduingCalifornia . Jessie extracted pencil and paper from her black hand bag and began jotting down questions . After dinner she found that he husband , father and brother-in-law had engaged in the same process ; fo four hours they sat in the library framing a cross-examination whic would lay bare a truer picture . When they went to bed that night she sai. to her husband : " I can sleep easily for the first time since this trial opened , for I thing General Kearny has exposed himself . " i She had found that trouble and love were not amiable companions : from the moment they had left Silver Spring and plunged into the wor of the trial , she and John had not been husband and wife , or even sweet hearts , but business partners immersed in difficulties which threatened their association . Tonight because she genuinely felt the confidence she had been pretending , because he too felt hopeful , they could be lovers once again . P161The next morning , refreshed and bright-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cool and invigorating air to the Arsenal . There were a few people standing outside the entrance , with its wide wooden overhang , and some of them spoke in a friendly tone . " Good luck to you , Colonel . Do n't be afeared of them , Mrs. Fremont , , Icy ca n't hurt you . " The Union that morning had stated that Colonel Fremont would Toss-examine General Kearny ; there were whole periods of the Californiastory to be gone over , hundreds of people would testify and a thousand documents be introduced , but everyone in Washington knew hat this was the critical moment of the trial , when the two adversaries %vc ould come face to face . It was still a half-hour early when Jessie and John entered the courtroom , but every seat was taken . There was a hum of conversation , and quick looks were flashed at them as they walked down the aisle , an uncommonly handsome couple : **26;9023;TOOLONG in a sea-green redingote with a brown velvet bonnet which matched her hair , her slender cheeks brushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her eyes glistening from the confidence in which he people of the courtroom engulfed them , her mouth red and moist ; and tightly gripping her arm , her thirty-four-year-old husband , his black hair combed forward a little over the brow and waving back across his cars , looking older and dignified because he was no longer shaving the beard which had grown during his third expedition and his year in California , walking erect and proud , his vitality evident beneath his fulldressuniform . For a moment he slipped into the spectators ' seat beside the one which was reserved for Jessie and said quietly in her ear , so that one could hear : " After today , you wo n't be ashamed to be known as Mrs. Fremont . oday your name is going to be vindicated . " " Oh , darling , " she murmured , " nothing that could ever happen in all this world would ever make me ashamed of my name . I carry it like hat medal of honor Baron Humboldt awarded you . " " I 'll confess that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied with a wistful smile . As he started to rise she took his hand and asked entreatingly , " Do be artful , dear ; let General Kearny make the mistakes , let him be bitter and harsh and resentful . Ile had his day yesterday , today is yours : you can afford to be chivalrous . " He patted her hand . " ' Trust me , " he said . " My sword has such a fine edge this morning that the general wo n't know his throat is rut until he tries to turn his head . "   It was not the answer for which she had hoped , but she had to be con. tent with it . The court was opened , General Kearny sworn in and John rose , glanced at the papers before him , then addressed his commanding ; officer . Jessie was relieved to see that his voice was quiet and his manner ffi courteous . She had been sitting tensed on the hard bench of the mustard  --  colored room ; it was still cold and she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The moment John began to speak her tensio . = , relaxed and the room felt warmer ; she sat comfortably , while to her ea there came the cross-examination which seemed to her to vindicate he husband . " General Kearny , did not William W. Russell , my secretary of state in California , come to your headquarters in Los Angeles on January 13 and tell you that I had sent him from the plains of Cahuenga where I had just accepted the surrender of the Mexican Army ? " " Yes . " " Did not Mr. Russell tell you that he had been sent for the purpose of ascertaining who was in chief command at Los Angeles , and after learning who this was , to make a report of the surrender of the Mexican Army and the armistice terms I had granted them ? " " Mr. Russell came to my headquarters on the thirteenth of January . " " Did not Mr. Russell ask you whether your arrival in the country had superseded Commodore Stockton 's , who had before been recognized as chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did you not tell him that Commodore Stockton was still in chief command , and tell him to make his report to the commodore ? " " Yes . " " And this was exactly four days before you ordered me to cease obeyingCommodore Stockton and henceforth carry out your orders ? " " It was . " " Did you receive any orders from Washington between the fourteenth and the seventeenth of January , changing your status ? " " No dispatches reached me during that period . " A gasp went up from the audience ; there came scattered applause . Jessie turned about in her seat gratefully ; she saw that the spectato agreed that her husband had sincerely tried to find out who was the legal commander in chief ; that General Kearny had contradicted himself . While the judge advocate threatened to clear the court , John asked that General Kearny be excused and put William W. Russell on the stand . Russell testified that he was a major in the California Battalion , had participatedin the surrender of the Mexicans at Cahuenga , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find out who as the commander in chief . " Mr. Russell , when you talked to General Kearny at headquarters , beretaking your report to Commodore Stockton , was my name men-coed ? " " It was . General Kearny expressed great pleasure at Colonel Fremont ring in the country , and spoke of his eminent qualifications for the office governor and his knowledge of the Spanish language and the manerof people . He told me that it was his intention to appoint Colonel Fremont governor of California if the instructions which he brought with m from the secretary of war were recognized in California . " " Did you then submit my reports to Commodore Stockton ? " " Yes , sir ; I learned from the commodore that his relations to the territory as chief commander were in no wise changed by the arrival of General Kearny in the country . " " Did you then return to the California Battalion ? " " I did . I met Colonel Fremont at the head of his battalion on the turning of the fourteenth of January , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had much conversation with both General Kearny d Commodore Stockton , touching their respective positions in the pantry ; that I was satisfied , from what had occurred , that General was a better friend of his than Stockton ; but , from Kearny 's wn admission , I regretted to have to give it as my opinion that we would have to look to Commodore Stockton still as commander in chief ; at I found Stockton exercising the functions of commander in chief and submitted to implicitly , as I thought , by Kearny . " " Mr. Russell , did obedience to the command of Commodore Stockn inpreference to that of General Kearny , when both were claiminge chief authority , present any advantages personal or military to Colonel Fremont ? " " I think not ; General Kearny was known to have funds ; and expected shortly an arrival of troops . He was , besides , known to be a warm friend Colonel Fremont 's family . I am satisfied that Colonel Fremont elected obey Commodore Stockton alone from a conviction of duty . " Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were rising tpidly . John then summoned General Kearny back to the stand . " General Kearny , four days later when you ordered me to cease servunderCommodore Stockton and obey your commands , did I not form you that Commodore Stockton had refused to cancel my apartment in the Navy and that he would consider me mutinous if I led to recognize him as commander in chief ? "   " As commander in chief of California I was not bound by Corn ' dore Stockton 's statements . " " But you knew that he threatened to use his sailors and marines keep the California Battalion from being dismembered ? " " I was not convinced that Commodore Stockton would use his sail . against the California Battalion . " " Did you inform Commodore Stockton that he was no longer co. mander in chief of California , and that you were ? " " I so informed the commodore . " " And did he not refuse to step down from command ? " " He refused to acknowledge my command . " " Since I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranking officer to you and the commodore , were you not trying use me to settle your dispute with Commodore Stockton ? " The judge advocate refused to allow the question . John turned , ga at his wife for a long moment , then walked closer to the witness box . " When I sent my first respectful letter declining to make any decisi. until the question of rank was settled , did you not say that the man w carried my letter was a stranger to you ? " " I do n't recall that I did . " " Then let me read it to you from your own testimony . " After he had read this bit from General Kearny 's testimony , John co tinued , " That letter was brought to you at your headquarters by Chris , pher Carson . Did you not spend many weeks on the trail with Kit C. son , using him as your guide ? " " Mr. Carson served as our guide . " " Then how could you not recognize him a few weeks later when brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your letter was a stranger to me . " John Fremont called Kit Carson to the stand . Jessie exchanged fragmentary smile with him as he came down the center aisle , havi been summoned by a guard . After Carson was sworn in , John asked : " Did you take a letter from me to General Kearny on the seventee of January 1847 , saying that until General Kearny and Commode Stockton adjusted between themselves the question of rank , where thought the difficulty belonged , I should have to report and recei orders as hitherto , from the commodore ? " " I carried that letter to General Kearny . " " Did he recognize you ? " " Recognize me ? " asked Carson , puzzled . " Did he know that you were Christopher Carson ? " " We were on the trail together . How could he not know me ? "   " Thank you , Mr. Carson . I should like to call General Kearny to the st.1nd again . " General Kearny , did you not inform the officers of your staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were goingo arrest me ? " " I may have mentioned it . " " When did you instruct me that I was to be placed under arrest ? Was t not on the sixteenth of August , six months later , after we had reached ort Leavenworth ? " " You were placed under arrest at Fort Leavenworth . " " Did you give me any chance to gather data for my defense in Caliornia ? Was I able to inform my witnesses that I had need of them in ashington for the court-martial ? " " You were informed of your arrest in due time at Fort Leavenworth . ' " When you ordered me to return to Washington , did you not refuseie the right to go to San Francisco and collect my journals , drawings , heaps and specimens of the third expedition ? " " That was government property , unfit to be trusted to an officer crelict in his duty . " " Did you not refuse me permission to take my battalion to Mexico , serve under General Taylor , even though General Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know of no such advice from General Scott . " " When I asked for permission to return over a new route to complete y maps for the Topographical Corps , did you not oblige me to march hind your army under guard of the Mormon Battalion ? " " You marched behind the Mormon Battalion . " " Just one last question , General Kearny . Did you not attempt to ArentLieutenant Gillespie and Midshipmen Beale and McLane from aving California , even though they were overdue in Washington ? " " I have no authority over naval officers . " " But did you not go to Commodore Shubrick and ask that these men t be allowed to.make the overland passage ? " " I informed Commodore Shubrick that I did not think Lieutenant illcspie a responsible man to be wandering loose in California . " It was four o'clock . The court adjourned for the day . Jessie sat happy d almost complacent in her seat , waiting for the three men to gatherp their papers inside the railing and go with her to the carriage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be obvious to everyone that cneral Kearny had had a sudden change of attitude , had decided to lime command after informing everyone that Commodore Stockton as the commander ; that John had been justified in not being able to understand this shift , since no new orders had arrived ; that he w right in refusing to be responsible for deciding which of his superi. officers was the commander in chief of California . General Kearn motives and conduct had appeared in a bad light , he had shown him . - overbearing while in California , and today on the stand had display . such vindictiveness to the younger officer as to render his testimony i valid . Early the next morning , when she was working in the archives the War Department , she stumbled across the original report that Gener Stephen Watts Kearny had filed against Colonel John Fremont . Numb she perceived that these were not the charges on which her husband w being tried , that the final bill of particulars had been drawn up by t War Department itself . HER CONFIDENCE of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mea over , their gleeful confidence had been self-deception . Since the W Department had enlarged and elaborated the charges , since they h. selected their own board of judges and were running the trial to s themselves , nothing John could prove would make the slightest differen. in the verdict . She told no one of her discovery , but put on a gay face and tried make a few jokes in the carriage when her father called for her . H. sense of impending disaster was magnified during the day when s found the court consistently ruling against her husband : refusing allow Commodore Stockton to testify on the stand that he was the leg commander of California ; refusing to admit to evidence reports of t secretary of the navy and the secretary of war which praised John 's co. quest of California ; refusing to oblige Lieutenant Emory and Colon Cooke to testify whether or not they were the authors of the anonymo letters in the newspapers prior to the trial ; refusing to allow John introduce material tending to prove that General Kearny had used h @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathetic the defendant ; refusing to allow any material to be presented whi might impeach General Kearny as a witness . The trial , which up to this point had proceeded quietly , broke in an unending series of wrangles . Every few moments the court was order cleared , and Jessie and the spectators were forced to stand for an ho in the vestibule , returning to the courtroom in time to hear , " the col can not inquire into the refusal of General Kearny to grant ColonFremont. . . the court can not inquire into the orders given to Colon . P167Fremont at Fort Leavenworth . . . the court has read the documents pehmitted and finds they have nothing applicable to the case now on Frial . . . the court decides that Colonel Fremont 's objections to the t ) arse to be pursued can not now be entertained . . . " After working with John , her father and brother-in-law for five hours at night on a paper to prove that certain evidence could be introduced , he would lie wide-eyed in bed until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department to unearth the proper documents to buttress their bief  --  only to find their material challenged as irrelevant and inadmissible , to have the court cleared while she stood in the cold and drafty foyer.Liting to be readmitted , and then to hear the crushing blow that theIcurt had once again decided against them . She was no longer able to reassure her husband that all would come it well ; nor for that matter could John play the game any longer . illiam Carey Jones alone insisted that they were getting an unIrcjudicedtrial , even though the judges almost never agreed with his rnetrating analyses of the laws of evidence . They worked terribly hard , it along on too little sleep and too little food , lived half the time on blackKnffee . As their sense of frustration and injustice rose , their nerves became rayed . Jessie grew thin , dropped below a hundred pounds . She was ! armed over what was happening to her husband ; her heart suffered impression pains when she saw how his black eyes were sinking deeper , . coming filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This as bad , it hurt their cause , yet when she tried to quiet him , to assure im they were getting a fair trial , she knew that within the hour a deisionof the court would confound her , that they would become frenzied y learning that the questions which the judge advocate was asking eneral Kearny had been written beforehand by General Kearny him-If ! Ier father 's wrath had been aroused as Jessie had never seen it dur-g the years of his hardest battles . The attack on his son-in-law left him rieved and wildly partisan . At least half of his judgments had to be gown out because he was indulging in illogical and violent reasoning . Sitting beside him , emanating a chill which would have frozen any her man 's turbulence , sat William Carey Jones , with cold . green eyes , is light-skinned face expressionless , unruffled , dousing the fire of Torn rIiton 's emotions in icy legalistic thinking . Jessie frequently had to reemberback to that one revealing moment when he had permitted him-f to display his loyalty for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be worthless as counsel . Yet as she observed the Lcans by which the briefs and arguments were prepared step by step that not only before the court but in the daily press John would look his very best , she saw that the rapierlike brain of William Jones was their greatest asset . She watched her husband at work , torn by the accusations and evidence piling up against him , realizing how much damage his enemies were doing to his reputation day by day , yet always and completely positive that he had been right , that there had been no other possible course of action for him , that General Kearny 's entire motivation was one of rvenge because of wounded dignity , the motivation of men like Emory an . Cooke based on envy and jealousy , that of the War Department to re establish its own pre-eminence when obliged to work in concert with th . Navy . It was neither the nerve strain nor the unceasing labor that got the down , but rather the feeling that they were batting their heads again a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same words of defens that Jessie , the spectators and the newspaper reporters were hearing , ye no argument had any effect . The newspapers grew irritated with th. court , asked in editorials why it was taking longer to settle their interne cine squabble than to win the war in Mexico . Thomas Hart Benton , the oldest and wisest among them , broke fir under the strain . Shortly after the opening of the court one early Decem ber morning , General Kearny rose heavily to his feet and charged : " I consider it due to the dignity of the court that I should here stat. that when I was answering the questions propounded to me by the cou the senior counsel of the accused , Thomas H. Benton , of Missouri , s. in his place , making mouths and grimaces at me , which I considere. were intended to offend , to insult , and to overawe me . " There was a gasp in the courtroom . Jessie 's cheeks flamed in em barrassment . The spectators craned to concentrate their gaze on Senato Benton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard th president of the court say that he had not observed the occurrence bu regretted very much to hear of it . He then read the 76th Article of th Rules and Articles of War prohibiting the use of menacing words , si. or gestures in presence of the court-martial . There was an expectan hush when the president finished . All eyes were again turned on Senato Benton . He pulled himself to his feet , his face a dull brick red , and crie. angrily : " General Kearny fixed his eyes upon Colonel Fremont , looked insult ingly and fiendishly at him . The judge advocate , by leading questions , le . General Kearny into a modification of what he had previously sworn ... ' A member of the court rose and said : " Mr. President , remarks ri fleeting upon the integrity of our proceedings are not , in my opinio admissible . . .

I did today look at General Kearny when he looked at Colonel Fremont , and I looked It him till his eyes fell  --  till they fell upon the floor ! " When Jessie reached home , after hearing her father reprimanded by he court , she flung herself into her big leather chair and wept unreRrainedly . This was the kind of blow for which she was not prepared . Whatever obloquy her husband might endure because of his conduct in be line of duty they could somehow face up to ; but that her father h ( iuld so completely forget himself . . . that he should leave himself pen to bitter criticism , made her heartsick and guilty at the grief she was ( ringing upon him . Because of her he was profoundly hurting his name Ind the career he had so long cherished . THE BEGINNING OF DECEMBER , after having awakened with nausea irce mornings in a row , she knew that she was pregnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and misgiving . This as the first time since the birth of Lily that she had become pregnant ; at this time she would have a son she had not the slightest doubt . She new what joy the arrival of a boy would bring to her husband , how nuh pride and renewed ambition . For all this she was happy , and yet her husband were convicted and discharged from the service he wouldt lost , not know where to go or where to turn ; their delight at the birth their child would be submerged by their misfortune . The very moment she was convinced that she was with child , Jessie lade two resolutions : that she would tell no one until the trial was over ; i at they simply must not lose the case . She vowed that she would work rr fingers to the bone , fight every last point to its uttermost extremity 11 ( 1 beyond , that they would never give in . The early scenes of triumph , u clear-cut justification for her husband had to be brought out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not be born into a wrld in which his father was an outcast . He must be born into a world which the name of Fremont was honored . She walked to her mother 's room and , being preoccupied with herthoughts , forgot to knock . Eliza was sitting on her mother 's chaise ; fragment of a sentence hung in mid-air ; the two women looked guilty. txsic closed the door and , holding the knob in her tightly clenched fist , Mncd against it , crushing her fingers . The physical pain drove out the pain of having come upon her mother and sister while they were dis . cussing her . The three women maintained an awkward silence for moment while Jessie asked herself what it was that they had been talkie : about . Had they been condemning her husband ? Had they been critici ing her for her part in this drama ? Were they ashamed of the stand resentful that their names had been dragged through the gutters of pu . lic gossip ? She left the door and came forward to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them look up at her , and when she sa their eyes , soft and solicitous , she understood that only in her ove wrought condition could she have accused her mother and sister of be ' disloyal . They had been pitying her , that was all ; pitying her for h- , troubles and her burdens . She could imagine the dialogue between the could hear them regretting that she had married a public figure , th she had gotten herself immersed in these questionable courses of actio. pitying her for her misfortunes . She knew that her mother would be r. membering the scene on the boat and in the carriage going to Cher Grove , when she had cautioned her daughter against plunging her happ and protected life into conflict ; would be remembering how positi Jessie had been that that was what she wanted , that her mother had be wrong to evade the important issues of life . Her mother probably thoug that now she understood what a terrible mistake she had made , an wished that she had listened to older counsel . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her marriage anything that happened in it , including the events that had led up this trial . She was not afraid of life ; she was not afraid of bold and vi ; . orous action ; she was not even afraid of this trial and its consequent .. Having endured the worst that participation could bring about , she w. qualified to speak ; she wanted to cry out to her mother that she had n. changed her mind , that she still believed in a life of action and conflic in working by a man 's side no matter how much mud splattered on hem of her garment . She did not want their pity ; it was unendurable to her . They did n. understand that they were pitying her for a suffering which she was n. undergoing . If it were part of her job to have the fierce white light . publicity on her ; if it were part of her job to endure public exposurewell as public acclaim ; if it were part of her job to have her husband an her name smeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay order to carry forward an important work . No , she did not want the ' pity ; it was misplaced . Let them rather pity weakness and withdraw . the inability to endure the ravages of conflict and to come out of it wi a serene heart and an ever increased faith in one 's destiny . P171She had forgotten why she had come into the room . She smiled a little too brightly , kissed her mother and her sister on the cheek , went out again without speaking . On the night of December eighteenth Jessie , John , Tom Benton and William Jones worked straight through until dawn organizing a bill of particulars against the conduct of the court , summing up and analyzing every adverse decision and showing how their parallels had been decided affirmatively for General Kearny . They finished work at six , after which she had a cup of coffee , bathed , and was driven to the War Department to copy a number of paragraphs needed in the brief . The work occupied her until a few minutes before noon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bite of food . She hurried to the Arsenal to provide her husband with the needed material . She could not see him very clearly when he arose to present his brief , but she could not decide whether this was because the now unhappy , shrunken face of John Fremont was suffused in a haze of frustration or because there was a roaring in her head . The first words were the only ones that Colonel Fremont could speak out : the judge advocate challenged the admissibility of the brief , and the court was cleared . She went out into the bitterly cold vestibule , with icy drafts blowing in through the windows and the cracks under the doors . She stood still as long as she could , then walked back and forth to generate warmth . By three o'clock she could no longer stand on her feet and had to ask an acquaintance to drive her home . She went to bed immediately . The room was swinging around , her body was burning as though a coal stove had been ignited inside her , her ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only dimly did she hear her husband 's words of comfort . But one word of the doctor 's she heard distinctly before she lost consciousness : " Pneumonia . " Her sister Eliza came back home to manage the household . Eliza was not very good at expressing herself in words , but when it came to expressingherself in deed , there was no one more eloquent . She kept Jessie 's room at exactly the right temperature , no easy task in the middle of a raw December ; either she or Maylee or a nurse was present every moment of the night and day ; delicate and nutritious foods were prepared and kept warm over a brazier at the bedside . Mrs. Benton , who had taken to her bed altogether for the past two months to avoid the storms which were rocking the Benton household , had Maylee dress her each morning and , despite the fact that the left side of her face and body still were semiparalyzed , spent many hours by her daughter 's side , holding her hand and telling bright stories from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that somehow he had brought this illness upon his wife . Jessie saw that he was reproaching himself unreservedly , even though when he visited her he kept a carefree smile on his face . Tom Benton alone did not seem alarmed : Jessie had pneumonia ? Well , lots of people had pneumonia ! If he had been able to conquer the tuberculosis which had carried off the rest of his family , how could anyonedoubt that Jessie would very quickly throw off anything so transitory as pneumonia ? Nor had it occurred to Jessie that her life was in danger ; all of her nightmares had been woven around her husband and the trial . For four days she was very ill ; at three o'clock of the fifth morning the fever broke . As soon as her strength returned she demanded news of each day 's proceedings . She thought it sweet of her husband and father to take a light tone , to assure her that everything was going well . They did not know that she had bribed Josheem to bring her fresh copies of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left the house , and that she was following the case word for word . It was not good for her to read the proceedings when they contained bad news , but the anxiety of uncertainty was worse . She spent Christmas and New Year 's in bed propped up straight against a bank of cushions . Her father set up a small Christmas tree in the corner of her bedroom , and the doctor gave permission for the family gifts to be opened in her presence on Christmas morning . John had run wild , spending almost the last of their rapidly diminishingfunds on dozens of gifts for her , ranging all the way from pearl earringsto a sea-green silk lounging robe which she had to take off hastily because it made her face seem even greener than it was . By the end of the third week she was out of bed trying a few experimentalsteps around the room , her legs feeling as weak as they had the first time she had tried to walk after giving birth to Lily . She leaves heavily on her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soft , thick carpet . She had thought she would like to stay up for an hour or two , but at the end of five minutes she was grateful to b helped back to bed . Each day she ate everything Maylee put before her in an effort to recover quickly , put on a little weight , so that the men would let her resume work . By the third week in January she was remaining up all day . She did her best to conceal her pregnancy from the doctor ; he complied with her tacit wish to keep the matter secret for just a little . longer . The hearing already had dragged through three months , exhaustingthe patience of the nation . By the last days in January the . end finally came into sight . Though John refused her permission to attendP173ourt for the few remaining sessions , the men could not persuade her to cep away from the drawing up of the final statement for the defense. his summation proved to be their best collaboration of the trial , each f the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document began with John 's arrival in California , told of the ammunition , food , money and medical supplies given him by the Navy in order to help in the conquest , related the story of the war with Mexico and the surrender in California and the events leading up to the conflict over i ommand . The testimony and documents submitted over a period of three months were sifted and analyzed , the discrepancies and irregularities set aide by side . On the face of it Jessie felt confident that although the court might bring in a guilty verdict on the two lesser charges of disobedience and conduct to the prejudice of military discipline , there could be no real basis for sustaining the charge of mutiny . The next morning no one worked . The family assembled for a late breakfast : Jessie and her husband , Eliza and her husband , Thomas and Elizabeth Benton , her two younger sisters and brother . They dallied over their shirred eggs and coffee cake , dressed leisurely and departed en masse or the courtroom just a few moments before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read his final summation inwell-modulated voice . Her confidence grew as he clicked off point fter point , building a solid edifice of justification . At four o'clock , when t was time to adjourn , the court granted him permission to continue his resentation , and so he carried on for another hour , his voice growing a little throaty , but more resolute all the while . At the very end she sat almost unbreathing while he made the last eloquent plea which she and er husband had written in the same collaboration with which they had mated the reports of the first two expeditions . " My acts in California have all been with high motives , and a desire or the public service . My scientific labors did something to open Gallo ! nia to the knowledge of my countrymen . My military operations were i siquests without bloodshed ; my civil administration was for the public good . I offer California , during my administration , for comparison with the most tranquil portions of the United States . I prevented civil war Against Commodore Stockton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I arrested civil war against myself , by consenting to be deposed  --  Ifering at the same time to resign my place of colonel in the Army . " I am now ready to receive the decision of the court . " The spectators broke into applause . Even the row of judges looked tisfied , as though this had indeed been a worthy presentation of a complicatedcase . Jessie relaxed ; their tribulations were over , they had ac- quitted themselves in the best possible fashion . She started to rise , as had part of the audience , when suddenly , in a hard tone , in a manner become emotional and bitter , she heard her husband exclaim : " Mr. President , I can not rest my case without one final statement . " 0 dear God , thought Jessie , what has happened ? What is he going to do now ? " Certainly the difficulties in California ought to have been inquired into , " said John loudly , " but how ? Not by prosecuting the subordinate , but the principals ; not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made civil war . If it was a crime in me to accept the governorshipfrom Commodore Stockton , it was a crime in him to have bestowedit ; and , in either event , crime or not , the government which knew of his intention to appoint me , and did not forbid it , has lost the right of prosecuting either of us ! I consider these difficulties in California to be a comedy of three errors : first , in the faulty orders sent out from this place ; next , in the unjustifiable pretensions of General Kearny ; thirdly , in the conduct of the government in sustaining these pretensions . And the last of these errors I consider the greatest of the three . " When he had finished he stood by his table awkwardly . Jessie felt herselfgrow limp . She rose and rushed down the center aisle of the courtroomblinded by tears . All of their good work had been overthrown . The uncertainty lodged in the deepest fragment of John Charles Fremont 's heart had betrayed him . WHEN SHE REACHED HOME she suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bile . The presence of Maylee with her strong a clasped about her waist was all that kept her from slipping to her kneesMaylee picked her up and put her into bed , where she lay white an . weak and frightened . She pretended that she was asleep when her h band came up to the room several hours later ; with her eyes shut sh . could see his face : dark , twisted , unhappy , ashamed of his last outburs but preferring to die before he would admit that he should n't have don it or that he had hurt his own chances . She lay still while he slipped into the bed beside her . She wanted to turn to him and take him in her arms , to comfort him , to kiss the unshed tears from his eyes , to smooth away the gnarled lines that slashed his face . But she dared not , for she feared she would herself break down and cry , give an indication of how tragi she thought his mistake in antagonizing the court and appearing before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ; havin. built a magnificent defense to prove that he had not been guilty in Cali-P175Mrnia , then in a last shattering few minutes to reveal the very temper end manner which General Kearny and the War Department had been prosecuting these three months long . She did not love him the less for his outburst ; she loved him the more , as a mother loves an errant and headstrong child whom she can not control . Nor could she reveal that she felt sorry for him and wanted to cradle his confused , hot head on her breast . Better to let the moment go and face the consequences than to injure their relationship by showing her husband that she pitied him . Though he made not the slightest move , though he lay like a man of stone at her side , she knew that he was not asleep , and she knew the agonies he was enduring as once again he mentallyrecapitulated his defense . Still she gave no sign that she was awake ; better to let this cold silence lie between them . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been listening . For another few moments she lay quietly , then she rose , put on a quilted robe and slippers , went down to the kitchen , where she made herself a cup of strong coffee , then went up to her father 's library . She had already participated in the writing of the defense ; now she must write the case for the prosecution , reacquaint herself with the evidence against her husband . Once she had drawn up the most formidable bill of particulars available , had put them all down in black and white , they would furnish her with a means of accepting the verdict of the courtmartial , enable her to go on from there . She was frightened at what might happen to John if a verdict of guilty on all charges was brought in ; she slid not know whether he would have the stamina to keep from further injuring himself in the intensity of his reaction . She , for the both of them , must be prepared to accept the worst . There were a number of glowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , me kindling from the woodbox , then added a walnut log and stood rubbing her pale slim fingers before the flames . When they were warm she sat in her old chair , drew her desk over her knees and began writing rapidly . It was not difficult to build up a formidable case against Colonel Fremont , for its particulars had been dinned into her ears in the courtroom for three months . She recounted the twenty-two specifications , starting with his three-day stand at Hawk 's Peak , his assistance to the Americansin Mexico in their " Bear Flag Rebellion , " his share in the unauthorizedconquest of California , his unauthorized acceptance of Mexicansurrender , through to the point where he refused to relinquish his " mmand to an army officer sent by the War Department . When John C. Fremont had converted his third expedition into the California Battalion , one of his men had refused to make the shift and be plunged into a war . John had ordered him locked in a du geon below Sutter 's Fort overnight . By morning the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single act of coercio constituted the blackest deed of the California exploit : John Fremon demanded absolute obedience and ironclad discipline ; had he not tol her stories of how he preserved this discipline on his three expeditions Had he not clapped one of his men into prison for failure to obey a unwarranted command ? Why then had he himself not accorded th same strict obedience and the same ironclad discipline to his superio officer ? If discipline were imperative for those below him in rank , w it not also imperative for those above him ? And if he were going to u force on a member of his exploring expedition , why was General Kearn not justified in using the same force on Colonel Fremont ? She could answer this only by concluding that John knew that uncle his appointment from Commodore Stockton as civil governor he woul be in command of the new territory , for the Navy would not rule on shore Commodore Stockton would set out for sea and John Fremont would b left in complete charge . Under General Kearny 's appointment he alwa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own sta officers with whom he had worked for years , and who were superior t him in rank . The principal appointments would go to real army men not to a Topographical engineer ; after he had done the groundwork played the most important role in the conquest , he would be ordered t pack up his maps and journals and report back to the Topographic office in Washington , his career in California ended . He would want t write up his third expedition , make his new maps , but once that was fin ished , what did he do next ? Having caught an image of a greater part fo himself on the stage of history , the function of topographer and ma maker must have seemed limited . From now on he would be a con queror of new territory , a governor of new states . All this he stood to los if he acknowledged General Kearny over Commodore Stockton . Jessie laid down her pen , walked once again to the fire and threw o another log . The hours of the night slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mass of detail , was the most important point of th controversy , one which had been allowed to remain obscure : John w an army man , he had always been an army man , he had attained hi rank , gained his honors and done his work as an army man ; the Arm had financed his expeditions , won him his respect and fame . It was ve well for him to be a naval officer while there was no superior army ma on hand , but the very instant a superior army officer arrived on th scene there could be no question as to his obligation ; under any circum  --  P177stances he had no alternative , no choice . When General Kearny ordered him to obey he had but one possible answer : " Yes , sir . " If John had made that one answer , these troubles would never have happened , there would have been no court-martial . With equal clarity there came to her the realization that from this iewpoint the procedure of the court-martial had not been prejudiced . John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and particularly above himself . Now she understood why the West Point officer did not like the volunteer officer : what the regular army man had as a part of his equipage , John did not have : the discipline that no matter how good his work , or how important he had become on the spot , he surrendered his position to a superior officer immediately that he arrived with authority to take over . . . regardless of whether the subordinate officer felt himself to be more qualified than the officer coming to supplant him . Allrmy officers had suffered such thwarting , but they had accepted it be-:ruse it was part of their tradition . John was not and never had been an army man ; he had been a topographerand engineer . Nor had she accepted the Army 's iron discipline as part of her husband 's unbreakable duty . Why did her father not condemnher for her mutiny , send couriers after the second expedition to bring her husband back to stand charges in Washington ? Why did he allow her to send John the signal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headstrong people ! Because we are driven by emotion , are certain of our superior abilities , and are unable to put ourselves aside , to make the sacrifice of pride and individuality to our government . We are all equally guilty , myself , my father and my husband , but I am the most guilty because I had no extenuating circumstances . She went back to her desk and continued writing . When she finished , lawn was just prying up the dark flooring of the eastern sky . As she walked down the long hallway she saw a light coming from under the rack of William Carey Jones 's door . She knocked lightly . After a moment her brother-in-law came to the door , a blue flannel bathrobe wrapped around his thin frame , a pen clutched in his right hand , his fingers inky . " Have n't you been asleep , William ? " she asked . " No , I . . . I was just making a few notes . " She saw that his desk was littered with sheets of paper , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he replied that she might , she walked past him into the bedroom ; Eliza was sleeping with her face turned away from the light . A glance at the small , tight , precise writing showed her that it was about the trial , but she did not gather at once what its point was . She asked in a whisper , " Why have you written down all this material ? " " A good lawyer must never be taken by surprise , " he replied with a minimum of voice . " He must know everything the opposition can bring to support its contention . " Jessie smiled wanly , handing him the batch of her papers . He read two pages , then looked up at her with a startled expression . " You 've been doing exactly the same thing . " " You know the old line about great minds , " she murmured , trying to force a laugh ; " would you care to compare our bills of particulars ? " " Let 's go into the library where we wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair before the fire and went back to the reading of her pages . After a few moments he shook his head . " Yes , " he agreed , " Colonel Fremont 's commission in the Navy was automatically canceled when General Kearny took over . " " What are our chances today in that courtroom ? " He rose , put her papers on the map table , stalked about the room holding the flannel bathrobe around his tall , skinny figure . " Light , William , light , " she murmured , " I am prepared to hear the worst . " He made the best case he could , pointing out that neither President Polk nor the Cabinet nor the majority of the Senate wanted a conviction . He spoke o ' her husband 's long and magnificent record of service . Jessie was not convinced . She replied so softly he almost could not hear : " William , you do n't believe your own arguments . If this case had not been your brother-in-law 's , you would never have pled it . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a verdict of guilty . " He denied her accusations . She did not press him . She kissed him lightly on the cheek , thanked him for all he had done for them . Just then her child moved inside her ; her heart and stomach seemed to turn over , and she began to tremble . " Whatever the law may be , I am not able to see it that way . I am his wife , and I know how he will suffer if the court declares him guilty . I know how it will wreck his life . I want my children to have a successful father , a man who can hold his head high . Oh , William , I am responsible : I led him into his first mutiny ; I urged him into the action in Californiawhich led him to believe that he could disobey General Kearny . If only I could take the blame ! " William Jones put his arm about his sister-in-law and said quietly , " Come , Jessie dear , you are overtired : you should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed now and get some sleep . You will want to be , t ' , mg and rested when we leave for court . " tike permitted herself to be led down the long hall to her room . At the doorway he patted her shoulder with his bony fingers . Jessie crawled exh.urstedto bed and fell into a black sleep . AYLEE HAD TO WAKE HER at ten o'clock when she brought up a hoterr ; ikfast . Jessie heard the torrents of rain sloshing against the outside lilldows . It was a dark , depressing day . She put on a knitted tan wool It ( ss with wide-bottomed sleeves over her white chemisette , and over her1 , tiilders she gathered her new brown Cornelia wrap which she fastened r front with a cameo brooch . A last glance in the mirror showed her that Let outfit looked much too somber , as though she were anticipating ther , rst , so she went to the top drawer of her bureau , rummaged through Ilse jewelry and slipped a long chain of bright green beads around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they lightened her spirit . She looked for the men and found each of them sitting alone and lent : her father in the library slumped down in his chair by the coldcplace ; her brother-in-law in his bedroom reading Plato 's Republic ; r husband in the drawing room hunched up on the divan before thew window . She kissed him on the cheek and said , " We are all ready tonow , " and gratefully took his proffered arm while he led her down too carriage . The courtroom was jammed with the hundreds of people come to hear e final verdict . The judges filed in , took their places at the high tribunal . After what eined an interminable silence , while her heart pumped hard and the hild within her never stopped moving , Brigadier General George M. ruoke rose , spread out a paper before him and started to read : " Of the first specification of first charge : Guilty . Of the second specifitionof first charge : Guilty . Of the third specification of first charge : uilty . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first specifications , with a ( ; silty " after each of them . He continued to read in a toneless voice : Of the first specification , second charge : Guilty . Of the second specification , second charge : Guilty , " and continued to declare seven times guilty . " Still carrying on in the clamped silence of the courtroom , he 7ritcrated : " Of the first specification , third charge : Guilty . Of the second speci &r.Ition,; third charge : Guilty . " P180There was one last strangulating moment , and then the judge advocat rose before General Brooke and announced : " The court finds Lieutenant Colonel Fremont guilty of mutiny ; c disobedience of the lawful command of his superior officer ; of conduc to the prejudice of good order and military discipline . The court do . therefore sentence the said Lieutenant Colonel John C. Fremont , of th regiment of Mounted Riflemen , United States Army , to be dismissed fro the service . " No one murmured or moved . Jessie did not dare to look at her hu band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter herb of h thoughts . Then General Brooke once again rose and said in an easi tone : " The majority of this court after careful consideration wishesmake a final statement : " Under the circumstances in which Lieutenant Colonel Fremont w placed between two officers of superior rank , each claiming to be co mander in chief in California  --  circumstances in their nature calc lated to embarrass the mind and excite the doubts of officers of greater experience than the accused  --  and in consideration of the important prof. sional services rendered by him previous to the occurrence of those ac for which he has been tried , the undersigned , members of the court , r spectfully commend Lieutenant Colonel Fremont to the lenient consi. eration of the President of the United States . " When they reached home John said : " You had better lie down once , Jessie ; I hope the verdict is n't going to make you ill . " She was surprised to find that instead of feeling ill she felt strong  --  than she had for several days ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when one 's fate hung in the balance and there was nothi one could do but suffer the tortures of uncertainty . Now she knew t worst ; it had to be endured calmly and strongly ; she had laid the groun. work for that endurance the night before when she had charted t  --  objective case against her husband . She knew that this was the time f. serenity and strength . To her husband she replied , " Thank you , dear , but I feel all righ There is nothing those thirteen judges could have said that could ha hurt me . That decision was arrived at before the case opened . A civilian jury in a civil court would have acquitted you . I can not be hu by the determination of the War Department to put the Navy in i place . As the judges had the courage to say at the very end , you we the victim of a conflict over authority . I held before this trial opened , an I hold even more strongly now , that you did exactly right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I acquit you on all charges , and I say w done . ' "   " It means a great deal to me , " said John , not looking at her . " Your ith in me is the one rock that can never be shattered . " " Good then , let us go in to dinner . I am ravenous . It seems to me that have n't eaten a hearty meal for weeks . " Later that evening she found her father in the library . She closed and eked the door behind her . He was having a difficult time repressing his get .. " Very well , " she said in a small voice . " The verdict is in . There is thing we can do about the court-martial . Let us put all thoughts of it t of our minds . The important question now is : what will President alk do ? " " He will overrule the decision of the court , " growled Tom Benton . " Are you certain of that ? " " He damned well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blast his administration . e knows that he and his Cabinet are responsible for the mess in Calirnia . They played careful and cautious ; they wanted the credit for duiring California , but they avoided the responsibility as though it were : inlet fever . They 're avoiding the conflict of the Army and Navy in extlythe same fashion . If President Polk does n't countermand that verct , I 'll start a senatorial investigation that will expose the whole gime . " Jessie felt the old sense of fear come over her . Why did men try to ver trouble with more trouble ? Why did n't they know that the more reply one became involved in exposure the more impossible it was to 11 oneself up out of the morass ? She did not want any more investigans ; she did not want more charges and trials and hurt feelings andted reputations . She wanted only peace now , peace to go back to ' r work . She wanted her husband 's hurts healed , as she knew that e alone could heal them . She wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger . " I only want one thing , Father , " she said . " I want President Polk to mmute the sentence . " ller father sensed the tremulousness in his daughter 's voice . He held tt his big bearish arms to her and she sat on one knee hiding her face his shoulder . " I 'm sorry , my little girl , " he said softly . " I 'm just dreadfully sorry . But ' t feel too badly about it ; most of the newspapers will protest the verct , call it intergovernmental politics , nothing more . " Without lifting her head , Jessie asked in a muffled voice , " Will PresiIntPolk commute the sentence ? " " Yes . Of that I am certain . The court 's recommendation for leniency makes it inevitable . That is why the judges put it in : it is their way telling John that all is forgiven , and he can come home . " She lifted her head , speaking with all the intensity of her being : " He must not leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten yea It 's the only life he knows and the only life he loves . He has such pride the Topographical Corps ; he had plans for so many expeditions , and much valuable work in carrying on the tasks of Nicollet and Hassler. if must give up his uniform and his rank and his work , he will be like a m whose arms have been cut off . . . " " I know , I know , " interrupted her father sympathetically . " We cant let him leave the Army . That is the one blow that would really crip. him . I will go to President Polk tomorrow , even though it is unnecessa No one wants Colonel Fremont out of the service . " " If President Polk will order that the verdict be set aside , I wo n't reg anything that has happened or even condemn the court .

" Everything you say is true , Jessie ; true and sensible . Have no furth fears . In another few days your husband will be back at work in t  --  Topographical office drawing his maps of the third expedition . " Jessie turned about , a new vitality seizing her . " That is the way it must be , Father ; he must go back to work at on . I know that after he is plunged into his maps and his reports these b memories will fade . After all , he did find a new trail to California , o which will replace the Oregon Trail . Thousands of people in the count are waiting to sec his new map and read his report .

" THE NEXT TWO DAYS , while they waited for President Polk 's decisio passed for Jessie in alternate rushes of hope and anxiety . She knew th when her father spoke in loud , blustering tones he could be wrong in judgment , but he had assured her quietly that the president would co mute her husband 's sentence . She firmly believed this , but of it she said word to John . She did not know what he was thinking , for he talked littlP183tli .. appeared for long stretches each day , returning with his boots and the bottom of his trousers wet and mud-stained . That he had great hopes in President Polk , she knew , for had not President Polk sent him secret orderswith Lieutenant Gillespie to take charge of the conquest in California ?

He would sustain Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his work in California and tell him to resume his ' ord . All these things Jessie learned were in her husband 's mind from the attered phrases he let drop as the weary hours spun themselves out . At noon of the third day , just as they were about to sit down to a uricheon for which no one had any appetite , a courier arrived from the Var Department . John jumped up from the luncheon table , ran into the c , yer , snatched the letter when Jessie reached his side ; together they read lie lines that danced crazily before them : Upon an inspection of the record , I am not satisfied that the facts ) roved in this case constitute the military crime of " mutiny . " I am of the tpinion that the second and third charges are sustained by the proof , and hat the conviction upon these charges warrants the sentence of the court . the sentence of the court is therefore approved , but in consideration of he peculiar circumstances of the case , of the previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the foregoing ecommendations of a majority of the members of the court , the penalty f dismissal from the service is remitted .

Relief and joy swept through her . President Polk had sustained her udgment , and that of the press and the people , by declaring her husband pnocent of mutiny ! It was unimportant that he upheld the court in depeeingthat John had been guilty of conduct in the prejudice of military iscipline . What was important was the fact that the president had praised ( cr husband , spoken of his meritorious and valuable services . He had rinitted the penalty of dismissal , ordered Colonel Fremont to resume his word and report for duty . She slid her arm about his shoulder and cried , " Oh , I am so happy , I new it would come out all right .

What have I done ? she asked herself , numbly . Why does he behave li this ? After a moment she followed him up the stairs to their bedroom . was standing at a window with his back to her , a back that had an : and hurt humiliation written across every hostile line . Jessie entered a stood in the center of the room . " John , " she said softly , " I 'm sorry if I offended you . It was only that was so happy and proud that President Polk had praised your work California . It seemed to me that by praising you , he was telling nation obliquely that this trial should never have been held . " Her words struck irresilience . Still groping in the dark , fearful lest offend him further , she slid into a chair , was silent for a few rnomen then continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a little selfish in this affair : I know t in part they have been trying you for my act two years ago in St. Lo when I suppressed the order summoning you back to Washington . And sent you the first unauthorized instructions to act in California . If Pr . dent Polk had declared you guilty of mutiny , he would have been convi. ing me as well . But the president said we are not guilty of mutiny . If h unwilling to expose his own hand , to tell the world that he fomented uprising in California through you , then we must suffer in silence . That the part of the job we agreed to do when I suggested you move quic and boldly . Who in the country is better able to vindicate you than o chief executive ? The president has declared publicly how valuable y. have been , and by ordering you back to your command , he is telling country that you are indispensable .

W did n't he have the courage to declare me innocent . . . ? " " He did , darling , he did , " urged Jessie , trying to placate him . " Do you see how he told the court they were wrong when they declared y. guilty of mutiny ? " " Then why did n't he overthrow the other two convictions ? Why di he deal in half-measures . . . ? " P185She interrupted , but quietly , so as not to antagonize him : " It would n't be wise to hurt the War Department too severely , John . ou must be tolerant ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  telydisavow the Army . That would lead to ill feelings , to conflicts ithin the government . . . " " I see ! It 's better to commit still another injustice , to declare an innoiitman guilty , rather than incur the displeasure . . . " " It goes deeper than that , John dear . Every day of his life the president as to make a thousand compromises . In this affair he has to keep you tisfied , and the Army and the Navy satisfied as well . I think he leaned ver on your side considerably ; he will suffer from it , never fear . " He took several steps toward her , demanding , " Then you approve his ccision ? You approve his declaring me guilty of disobedience to my supe-or officers , of conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline ? never thought I would live to see the day when my wife . . . " Sick at heart , Jessie jumped up , went to him and flung her arms about is neck . " No , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president had to throw the Army . " " Yet you approve the president 's confirmation of the conviction , " he ung out at her . " What a miserable state of affairs this is : you say I am pnocent of the charges , yet you approve the guilty verdict ! Really , Jessie , am astonished ! You 're taking sides against me . " " Please do n't say things like that . Ca n't you be generous enough to flow this compromise ? Then the affair will be settled to everyone 's satisc:tion . . . " " To everyone 's satisfaction ! " he cried with irony . " To my satisfaction ? fter I conquered a whole new territory for them , I have to be tried like criminal , have the court declare me guilty and the president sustain the rdict , and my wife tells me that it should be to my satisfaction ! Jessie , hat has come over you ? How can you say these things to me ? " She realized that it would be unwise to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full duty . Since her opposition seemed ly to infuriate him , she understood that it would be better to go along th him and by her agreement , her love , slowly soften his harsh anger , ur the edges of his indignation , and let time come to her rescue . She ust not allow him to feel that she too was against him , that she was partthe conspiracy to persecute him . Only a few days before he had told kr that her faith in him was the one rock that could never be shattered . Right or wrong , she must never allow that faith in her loyalty to be dissipated . There was a knock at the door . Jessie called , " Come in . " Her father entered the room . He carried the president 's paper in his hand ; he h smoothed it out , read the message and come up to congratulate John 4 the outcome . " I told you that President Polk would stand by the colonel ! " he claimed happily to his daughter . He walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said kindly , " I 'm happy for all our sa that it 's over . It will be good to see you come striding down the str again with your sword clanging at your side . I know how anxious you to get back to your work . . . " " I am not going back to my work , " broke in John , sharply . Tom Benton 's hand dropped to his side , while his big bluff face bore expression of bewilderment . " Not going back . . . " " No . I am resigning from the Army . " Tom screwed up his eyes until they were reduced to narrow slits , but , could perceive the meaning no better that way . He turned to his daughtasking , " What is the meaning of this , Jessie ? " She was passionately convinced that John must not resign , both becau she felt that his resignation would be in some small measure an admissi. of guilt , but mostly because she was horrified at the thought of his givi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he loved so ardent ) and for which he was so well equipped . What would he do ? Afterexpeditions and years on the trail , could he become a government de go to work in a shop ? To what did a man of his training turn ? He cou get a teaching job , but he was a man of action , not a man of theory a classrooms ; he would wither in such an atmosphere . She was not worri about how good a living he could earn , that was unimportant ; what co. cerned her was how her husband was going to find another place in t. world which would enable him to be valuable , to hold his head high , keep his flaming spirit , to be a man among men and a leader among m He had deliberately and joyously chosen his role and prepared himself f. it , just as her father had , and she knew how badly it would break Tho Hart Benton if he could no longer be the senator from Missouri . She must not let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter confident that she would agree with him and sustain his judgment : the years of happy marriage , the complete confidence and intimacy of the ' every plan had made it impossible for him to imagine that she would n uphold his decision . Faced with a painful dilemma , she had to choose between the equal desperate alternatives of permitting John to wreck his brilliant career , herself to wreck their marriage ; for she sensed that their marriage woul. be irrevocably injured if she inflicted upon him the blow of contesting P187udgment . Before she had accepted John 's proposal of marriage she had eked for the right to collaborate with her husband in his work , and he liul granted that right . It was a tragic mistake for him to resign ; it was rhitrary of him to take this step without consulting with her . But there utd been another covenant in the marriage agreement : she had promised D cherish him in sickness and in health , in misfortune and in prosperity , D go with him whither he went . These vows left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut the fabric of their marriage . His career would shift uul change and vary , rise and fall , succeed and fail many times over the Mars . But the marriage relationship was more tenuous , more in need of rotection : it must never fail , it must never shift and change and vary , it pttst not endure despair and renunciation . She thought , There are no ugly or painful memories that either of us stn evoke about our marriage , nor must there be any . Marriage is not qtly the most important relationship , but the one which can make all the lest of life seem beautiful and worthwhile , no matter how difficult its . ternals . If I sustain our marriage , I sustain all ; if I fail in this and yet au ceed in everything else , I shall have failed in my life . She went to her husband 's side , slipped her hand into his and held herrifagainst his shoulder . " It 's very simple , Father , " she said in a quiet , almost casual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But why ? " thundered Tom Benton . " He 's been pardoned ! He 's been , used ! Everyone expects him to go back . . . " " I 'm not going back to an army that could declare me guilty on twenty-o specifications , not even having the decency or comradely good will to eclare that I had proved my innocence on at least one of the counts . " " Of course , of course , " Tom boomed , " it was a miserable show . But ven of the judges signed the affidavit asking the president to commute e order . " John picked up a copy of the document lying on his desk , folded back jle first page , then pointed to a paragraph on the second . " Did you read this ? " he demanded , harshly . " Do you really advise me return to an army which says : The court has found nothing conflicting it t he orders and instructions of the government ; nothing impeaching the testimony of the part of the prosecution ; nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the resistance to authority of which the accused is conted . . . ' The only way I can register a full protest is to resign . " Realizing the grave consequences , but not knowing what to do next , om Benton turned to his daughter for the help he was certain would be forthcoming . " What do you say to all this , Jessie ? " he demanded.  | For a split second Jessie thought that her breath would stop coming . ' Her husband had been hurt anew by her father 's stand ; his pride already had suffered so deeply that there was danger of injuring his very fiber. would never recover if they stood against him . Knowing that her father was absolutely right and her husband absolutely wrong , she nevertheless understood that she must stand by her husband , by this man who had , never had a sense of security , a sense of the confidence of the world and his associates . She must accept his judgment and , more important , sho him by every word and gesture that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drew breath in sharply and replied , her voic under full control : " I agree with John . " Her father 's face seemed to sag . " You agree ! But Jessie , that 's impos . . . Only two days ago you .. " Two days ago I did not know that President Polk would not dismiss all the charges . " " But do n't you realize . . . " " I realize that an injustice has been done to my husband . It is his righ to register the severest possible protest . " All of the pomp and sternness went out of Tom Benton ; to Jessie ' blurred eyes it seemed that her father too was trapped . He cried in despair , " I thought I had trained you in masculine logic . thought I had made a man of you in straight thinking . And here you ar thinking like a woman ! " Jessie smiled a little plaintively , then replied , " Yes , Father , just like woman . " There was a finality in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappy at hurting him , at being obliged to conce  --  the truth behind her motives . But her first duty was to protect her hu band ; in marriage there was no right or wrong , logic or illogic , reason o unreason ; there was only a man 's nature to work with , a man 's gifts an . limitations , his emotion , his temperament , his personality , his character : these and these alone were the determinants of conduct . Marriage was throck ; all else was the foam which beat against the rock . SHE WENT WITH HIM to select the best black broadcloth on the marke yet the first time she saw her husband in civilian clothes Jessie 's heart sank In the eight years that she had known him she had never seen John in an apparel but his army uniform , which he had always worn handsomeP189.1 lid with pride . His dark suit had been well made , it fitted him nicely , hut he wore it awkwardly ; he who had shown infinite grace beneath his plain army blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew his stature had been lessened . Despite the fact that his notes , journals and drawings still were in San Francisco , Jessie was convinced that they had to write the memoir of his t bird expedition . Even if nothing appreciable came of it , the work would he the best thing conceivable for him . It would be difficult to get him to begin work ; yet there were important reasons why she must bring this third report into being : his salary , never a large one , had now stopped altogether . It was the first time that she had encountered an actual need for money : while her husband 's salary had been modest , their expenses in the Benton home had been small , otherwise they could not have saved the hree thousand dollars which he had handed over to the American consul Larkin in Monterey to buy a ranch in the Santa Cruz mountains overlookingthe Pacific Ocean . They yearned to leave Washington behind t hem , to go out to California , build themselves a home on their ranch , set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't the money to book passage to California , for the voyage was an expensive one ; they had no money to build themselves a house even if they could reach their ranch ; most serious of all , they had no resources with which to buy horses , farm machinery , feed and livestock , or to pay for the necessary labor . Tom Benton had offered to lend them money ; Harriet Bodisco had come to Jessie just before the trial with a jewel case of diamonds and sapphires and asked her to please sell them and use the money for their expenses ; friends like James Buchanan had offered to lend them anything they might need . She was not frightened at the lack of money , but she sensed how severely her husband might suffer if the burden of debt were added to the others . The memoir was a way out of their difficulties ; it would set her husband hack to work , help rid him of his concentration on himself . Its publication 4ould perhaps earn them a sum of money adequate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the book were successful , then she %vas confident that the newspapers and magazines would buy their stories . She worked on the assumption that eventually he would of course write his third report ; she had known that he would refuse to do so , and had prepared her attack against this defeatism . It was a long , slow , uphill rattle , but she was in no hurry . A good wife must be a leveler : when her husband was riding the crest it was her obligation to deflate his ego by placing his accomplishment in proper perspective , to keep him from 1r owing inordinately fond of himself . This was a comparatively simple t a d ( for any woman who had a light touch and was gifted with humor ;   the more difficult task for a wife was when her husband was discourage unhappy , at loose ends , without a job or a purpose or a direction . It w then that the wife had to create a healthy setting for her husband , esta lish the right mood , bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping in the forefront his gifts and accomplishments . Being a good wife was probably the most difficult achievement in th human agenda . After a few weeks , in the early days of March , she saw that she alm had him convinced ; she needed only one culminating stroke . That nigh she confided to her husband that she was pregnant , that this time she ha . the utmost confidence it would be their long-desired son , and she wante. to have the report finished before young John came into the world . Sh determined that by the time the child was born , sometime late in July the memoir must be completed and published , her husband once agai. established . Now more than ever she was grateful for the years of intensive trainin she had had with her father . She worked steadily , but not too long at stretch . She was not carrying as well as she had with Lily ; her youth an . health had been eaten into . However , her main concern was with he husband . Though she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , he would go to no dinners or parties , he too the long walks and rides so necessary to his well-being only after dar after he had put her to bed . At the dinner table it was obvious that h was unhappy , constrained . For once she did not regret it when Congr adjourned in the spring and her father returned to St. Louis . She though that the work and her companionship were helping her husband a littl. bringing him back slowly , enabling his eyes to look at people head on . Y. no one knew better than she what a slow process his recovery would be . Then one day , as she was sitting before her desk in the library rewritin a section of geographic description , he burst into the room with his oh time enthusiasm , embraced her and cried : " Darling , listen to this ! Your father has arranged another expeditio for me ! " Her eyes crinkled as she looked at his glowing face , spots of col bringing the warm flesh tones back to his cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said slowly . " But how . . . ? " " Some of his friends in St. Louis want to build a railroad to the Pacifi coast . They have the money and the backing ; all they need is a souther route that the trains will be able to run over in winter . " " They are engaging you to find a railroad pass , " exclaimed Jessie . " But of course ! Whom else could they turn to to find another pass ? " He pushed aside her little table with so much vitality that it fell ovP191nn the red carpet , the papers flying . He went on both knees before her , Ilhpped his hands under her arms and , gripping her shoulder blades with owerful fingers , exclaimed in a voice she had not heard since he had left on his third expedition almost three years before : " They are going to finance the expedition any way I want to put it ' t , ; ether . And they are willing to pay me partly in railroad stock , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , " she exclaimed , " you are going to be a railroad magnate ! nd after you find a new pass you will serve as engineer , lay out the whole oute for the railroad , just as you helped Captain Williams before you acne to Washington . " " God bless your father ! " exclaimed John . Amen , said Jessie to herself ; he has saved our lives . Aloud she said , " Let me see the letter . When must you go ? Are you to uy your equipment in New York or St. Louis ? How soon . . . ? " " Not so fast , not so fast , " he laughed gaily . " The details are to be irked out later . But here , you can see by the letter it is all settled . Ah , essie , I 'm so happy at this chance . . . " Jessie rubbed her cheek down the side of his soft beard . " We must hurry and finish our report , " she commented . " We must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to St. Louis . And while u are organizing your expedition and setting out on the trail for the ast for the fourth time , the country will be reading of your route to alifornia . . . There , I 'm crying all over your lovely beard . I am so appy for all of us . And particularly for your son ; when he gets himself rn his first sight of his father will be one of watching you prepare for c trail . " He combed his fingers through her long brown hair . " I 'm so happy I 'll even take a second daughter and like it . " " You 'll say as Father did , " replied Jessie mockingly , " two daughters r ( .a crown to any household . ' But will you swear ? " " Just like General Scott , " he grinned . " I thought you were so anxious ( 1 get on with this work ? Come along , then , let 's gather these papers hgether . I think I  --  can dictate some good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember whole passages I wrote in my journal . " The old John returned in full measure . They worked together vigoru'Jyand well , pleased with the way the memoir was shaping up , excited ) v et- the early preparations he was making to assemble his comrades from la first three expeditions . During the last two weeks of May she did an extensive rewrite by herself to give the material greater readability . A publisher had been found who was enthusiastic at the prospects of a N ) bgist sale .   One evening toward the end of May when she had put in an extrcm long day and had just about finished the last pages , she turned from work and said to her husband , who was lying in front of the fire : " John , you promised that there would be no more separations . ' 1 baby is due at the end of July . You do n't expect to leave on the expediti. until the end of September . I 'll be strong enough by then ; ca n't I co with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He turned over on his side , supported his head on one elbow and ga at her admiringly . " You have a lot of spunk , Jessie : you can sit there big with child . declare that only a few weeks after your baby is born you want to m the crossing over the Rockies in winter . No , my dear , not this time . " " But I ca n't bear the thought of being separated from you . . . " He leaped to his feet , picked her out of her chair , and sat down wi her on his lap . " You 're right , Jessie , no more long separations : you will come with to the Delaware Indian Reservation on the Missouri , my last jumping-. place . While I head overland , you will return to New York and take ship around Cape Horn . By the time I reach San Francisco you will there with the two children . We will go to our ranch and build our ho and then we will never be separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his chest . She felt tired a weak from her labors of the day and from a sense of being stretched to by the growing child within her . " I suppose you 're right , " she said . " The boy would be too young send with a wet nurse around the Horn . It wo n't be such a long time , a I 'll be happy at the thought of our new home . Now , set me back in t chair so I can finish those last pages . I want you to be here when I wri Finis . " He put her back in her chair , adjusted her desk , then went to the m table . After a moment or two she called : " Do n't move the lamp . It makes it too dark for me to write . " He turned swiftly . " What did you say , Jessie ? " " I said do n't move the lamp , it 's growing dark . Oh , John , quick , I ' . faint . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summoned the doctor , who ordered h. to remain there for the six or seven weeks until her baby should be bo She felt well again the next day , but was glad the doctor had restrict .. her . She would have a chance to rest and grow strong for her hour of tri . The memoir went to the printer , and in June the Senate ordered twen thousand copies of John 's map to California . The map was received witP193laim throughout the nation ; this triumph , added to the fact that it was fl ) wn he was organizing a fourth expedition , brought him back to himdl . The bad days were behind them ; they had survived and were going p ward . And so Jessie lay quietly in her blue bedroom with the windows overkingthe garden wide open , while her friends came to call , bringing her kndy and light romantic novels . At dawn of July 24 , 1848 , her son was born . It had taken her almost IVen years to fulfill one of her husband 's greatest needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely she could not have found a better moment to bear male heir . Flushed with pride she said to her husband as he appeared in k doorway : " You do n't need a flag to put over my bed this time . You have a son .

" Not John Charles Fremont , " he said , generous in his joy . " Benton rcmont , after your father . He has done so much for us . I want my son to trry his name . " WARD THE END OF SEPTEMBER she felt sufficiently strong to make the p to St. Louis . They traveled together as a family of four now . Lily , was almost six , was a quiet child , matter-of-fact , without any of the petuousness of her parents , rather like her grandmother and her aunt iza . They had tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ly 's small world , but she had seemed to understand what was going on , d Jessie had noted that her plain-faced and mild-mannered little girl d been solicitous of them during the bad months .

She hovered over the child , wanting to do little duties for him . cssie occasionally would let her select the dress or wrapper he was to car , which made her feel important . " When will he be old enough for me to play with him , Mother ? " she old ask . " Soon , " replied Jessie with a satisfied smile . " But how soon ? When we get to St. Louis ? Will you let me dress him ? " She was nursing the baby herself . It was too early to know what he% wild be like , but she was sometimes a little disturbed at how quietly hefly in her arms , how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breast . He had been born with a patch of black hair coming over his cars . and straggling down the back of his neck ; in his features he looked like h ' father , even to the dark skin . She loved him wildly . The early parts of the trip by stagecoach and train were pleasant in th early fall weather , with the leaves turning brown and the crops in th fields half through their harvest . They stood in the prow of the little riv.  --  boat Saratoga making its way down the Ohio . Jessie held the baby in h  --  arms , with Lily clinging to her skirt . Though she had borne two children her figure still was lithe and girlish ; her eyes were a deeper hazel and mo solicitous now , for they had come to know the nature of pain , but her fa was happy once again , her skin smooth , flushed with health . John w wearing a mustache , but he had had his beard cropped close befo leaving Washington , and he was carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a start Jessie realized that they were in much the same position Mary Algood , the young mother with whom she had talked on the ou skirts of St. Louis and who had invited her to come along to Oregon . I was now the Fremonts ' turn to go west to become free again . Her brai. whirled at the thought of how far they had risen in so few years , and ho far they had fallen in an even shorter time . It was particularly good to be back home in St. Louis . Everyone r : ceived them cordially . The enclosed galleries around the patio were sti warm and redolent of acacias . She was happy to slip into the slow , peat  --  ful life of the Mississippi River port , content to do little but take care o her son while John scurried about to meetings , buying his supplies an . interviewing the French voyagers who wanted to accompany him . He w disconcerted that only a few of his old-time companions of the trail wer available ; the others were scattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the most part he had to accept new and untried men . Her father was entranced by his first grandson , particularly because h. had been named Benton . It seemed to Jessie that everybody wanted t. fondle the infant . She had been told that she would leave with her hu band for the Delaware Indian Reservation in October . A competent an . reliable nurse was found so that Jessie was able to spend the last few da helping John and preparing her own clothing . Two days before they wer. to leave , John awakened at dawn , dressed and hurried out to meet h ' party of frontiersmen . Jessie was lying abed , half asleep and half awak  --  when the nurse came running in , her eyes wide with terror . " Mrs. Fremont , " she cried , " come quick ! We ca n't wake the baby .

She did not know how much time passed . Their family doctor , who ud taken care of the baby since their arrival in St. Louis , came into the ) n . Gently he took the child from Jessie , unwrapped the blanket and : ule a quick examination . He then covered the child . It was several uments before he spoke .

She held the ild to her , his little head on her shoulder , her cheek on his . " The baby is dead , Miss Jessie , " said the doctor . " Do let me have him . " She made no move . After several moments she looked up at the doctor it h a twisted smile and said without emotion : " I have had him such a it lc while . Please go away , all of you . We 'll wait here until my husband Ines . " She remained alone , still clasping the child . After a time John came up e stairs and into their room . She saw his sharp , worried look , his first ttcern for her and how she might be taking the loss . He leaned over her here she lay white-faced in the bed . She was grateful for his silence , and n she was grateful that he had begun to speak . His voice was compastiate . " I wo n't try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please do n't . " " The boy is gone . We will have to get used to the idea . It will be hard , t we can do it , together . " " You may take him now , " she murmured . John lifted the paper-light body of his dead son , took a last look at the y 's face , then covered his head with the blanket , stepped outside the r and gave him to the nurse . Quickly he returned to his wife 's side , d with the blankets tucked under her back and legs picked her up and tried her to a deep chair by the window , where she held herself to him th the same fierceness with which she had just a moment before held r son . " You can cry now , my dear , " he said . And so the tears came . All the tears she had not shed when her husband had returned from California a prisoner ; all the tears she had not during the days of the trial when the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stripped from him ; all the tears she had not when the court had declared her husband a malefactor , a traitor to service ; all the tears she had not shed when she had felt it imperative support her husband against her father , to help him resign from service and halt his career ; all the tears she had not shed when she seen her husband that first time in civilian clothes and realized wounded he was and how profoundly his stature had diminished . All these things somehow had not counted when her son had been bo this good fortune had made up for all they had undergone ; she no lon had any hatred for General Stephen Watts Kearny , for the judges of tribunal . In the depths of her gratitude she had freely forgiven them harbored no resentment . As the hours passed , the bitterness flooded back . If not for Gen. Kearny there would have been no arrest , no blasting of her husba career in California , no court-martial . Her husband 's return to Washi  --  ton would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health and serenity . Instead they had sapped her strength , made her dergo unending torment , and as her strength had fled , so had the stren .. of the child she was carrying . A defective heart ? No wonder ! How co she have carried a normal , healthy child during those miserable mont Now she could never forgive her husband 's enemies : they had robbed of his son . Lily was sent to the Brants ' so that she would not be exposed to the g of the household . When she was brought back Jessie asked that she co. up to her room . Lily was uneasy . Jessie took her daughter on her lap . " I have something to tell you . . . about . . . the baby . You see ... he ... " " I know , " interrupted Lily . " He 'll never grow up to play with me .

I 'm not sick in body , only in my heart . I feel better when you 're by my side . " " It 's lonely on the reservation ; there is only one white couple . I wo be able to be with you much during the day , I will have to be worki with the men . " She slipped her hand gently into his . " Just to know that you are close by will be enough for me . If I am wiP197u I wo n't need doctors and nurses . Please let me come . I need to be near u these next weeks . " He squeezed her hand reassuringly . " All right , I 'll take you with me on one condition : that you eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm frightened for you . " She took the fork of potatoes which he held to her lips . " Do n't be frightened for me , John . I 'll be all right . We 'll have more ns . Being with you on the reservation will help me ; when the time comes r you to leave , I will return to New York and take the ship around the orn . " THEY REACHED THE INDIAN RESERVATION at dusk of the second day . One clearing were a number of tepees of the Indian colony and two rough g cabins , one occupied by Major Cummins and his wife , the other for tssing trappers , guides and army officers . Major Cummins and his wifere plain but kindly people to whom hospitality was the first law of the ) ntier . They had had no opportunity to hear of Jessie 's loss ; when the pbins came in sight , Jessie asked her husband if they might omit all hcntion of the boy . The Cumminses had lived at this frontier point for thirty years , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman of about fifty , with all of the independence and matter-of-factness of the wives who ' How their husbands to the outposts of the world . She settled Jessie in the pcc-room cabin with its hard-beaten earth floor , its open fireplace for with cooking and heating , hand-hewn log table and chairs , and one shopluiltpiece on the reservation , the bed that had been carted on horseback rum St. Louis . Jessie had no wish to appear unresponsive to Mrs. CumUilts . John rose each day at dawn to join his men at camp . At midmorning cssie would walk a mile or so over the prairie to sit in the shade of the ottonwoods and watch them put their wagons , animals , gear , scientific Dcplements and foodstuffs into shape . It brought her comfort to watch ler husband directing his men , supervising the details of work to insure heir greatest possible safety . He appeared at his best at such moments : living his orders in a low and gentle tone of voice , yet commanding the rspect and instant attention of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved about the camp , the bright gleam of his eyes as he gaveword of approval here , corrected an error or oversight there , the ease with which he operated because of his experience and skill ; the feeling c gave of assurance , of joy in a well-loved task . And Jessie was grate- .   ful to her father for having secured this chance for him , grateful th Tom Benton should have invested several thousand dollars in a vent u from which he was not likely to receive any return . She walked back to the reservation at noon ; John rode in about fo o'clock to have a cup of hot tea with her and to chat quietly of the simp things that had happened during the day , or to lay their plans for t house they would build in California , with its windows overlooking t Pacific , the simple log-cabin school and church they would put up , mu . as Grandmother Benton had in Bentonville a half-century before . The nights should have been the easiest , for her husband was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in the darkness the ima : came back , images which the sparkling sun diffused . At night , lying sled less , her thin body curled up but her mind stiff and slablike , she sawface of her infant before her ; she felt the tugging of his gums at her bre . lived again the joy of those first hours when she realized she had giv - her husband a son to carry his name . At such moments she knew t there was no grief that could compare with the death of a son . When she fell into a troubled sleep she would be awakened by a s muted cry which would rend the silence of the night air , the cry of momentary but mortal struggle as something outside the cabin was kill . by an attacker . She mentioned these ghostly noises to no one , and it w not until the fourth day that she accidentally learned what they were , going out with John at dawn one morning to find the usually quiet-spok - Major Cummins in a torrential rage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he cried . " She just h a litter of cubs and she drags our sheep back there to feed ' em . We ' worked so hard and so long to raise these ewes ; we can hardly last out t. winter without fresh meat . " The merging nights and days passed all too quickly for her . At last t hour of parting struck . John 's men had moved ten miles out to the ed of the prairie , the horses being fattened against the lean months of fora in the snow-covered mountains . They were to strike camp at sunrise t next morning . As he left the cabin John called that he would be backfour o'clock tea . At noon Major Cummins knocked at her door . " Come along with me , Mrs. Fremont , " he exclaimed , a look of resol tion on his grizzled face . " I 'm about to prove the old adage that reven : is sweet . " Not knowing what he meant or what he wanted of her , Jessie thoug it the courteous course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the an corral between the cabins ; he helped her into the saddle and head sharply west to a deep-gorged ravine . He dismounted , assisted Jessie oP199i .. horse , took her by the arm and led her at so fast a pace that she t , , , iild have fallen were it not for his tight grip . The trail turned sharply , i 1 ( 1 just ahead Jessie saw a clump of oaks . " Wait here , Mrs. Fremont , " said the major , " you will be able to see all gilt . " She watched him drop silently to the oaks , take out his revolver and rc quickly five times . When the sound of the shots died away she heard oath moans similar to the ones that had interrupted her sleep in the bin . Major Cummins came up the trail , flushed . " That will be the end of the sheep killing , " he told her with grim satis-i tion . " I just killed all five of the wolf cubs . " Jessie 's head throbbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all ere was in this world . Everyone and everything kills . Men kill each her , animals kill each other , men and animals kill each other . Death and oodshed and misery . She whispered , " Major , I am feeling ill . You had better take me on nor horse and hold me , or I 'll fall off . " Anxious , though not understanding , Major Cummins lifted her to his rse and carried her quickly back to the reservation . He summoned his ife , who put her to bed and made her a strong cup of coffee . Jessie anked the woman , said that she thought she could go to sleep . She lay abed in the most aching misery she had ever known , worse than at hour when she had held her dead son in her arms . What was left but ath , continuous and senseless death ? What did life hold but ugly and nscless and tragic destruction of one 's hopes and plans and ideals ? She as not bitter against any one person or any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; men had to kill wolves to live . But did men have to kill men live ? Did they have to destroy each other to stay alive ? Did Kearny ve to kill her infant son in order to survive ? Was this world nothing ore than a cage of snarling beasts , with the rule of dog eat dog the only r that made survival possible ? If everyone and everything had to kill to ' c , was life worth while ? She did not hold Major Cummins responsible for what she had just tic through ; she did not even hold him responsible for what she knewwolf mother would suffer when she came back to her lair and found r five cubs dead . Major Cummins had had no way of knowing what ' % sight would do to her ; nor had he any way of knowing what this ling would do to the wolf mother . And even if he had known , could hec refrained from the butchering ? Could he let the wolf take away the eat that he and his family needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in winter ? Through all the years of her childhood , up to the last few months , she had believed that she lived in a good and beautiful world , a world in which ideals and kindness could survive , in which each person could determine the kind of life he wanted to live , where intelligence and training and industry led to accomplishment , where one could rest secure in the knowledge that he lived in an orderly universe . What a sentimental child she had been , what a blind , stupid and misguidedidiot ! She had thought she could lay out the pattern of her days . She had thought she knew what she was doing , that she could control events and circumstance . She had not listened to counsel , taken thopinion or guidance of older and wiser people ; she had been positive of what she wanted , of how she was going to get it ; of exactly what she was going to do with her life as the accomplishments and rewards rolled up . And now the dream had given way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greed and quarrelsomeness and lust for destroying ? She had thought before that her heart had been broken ; now she knew that it had only been suspended , enduring in a kind of somnambulistic trance the misery of her loss . Always deep at the base of her brain had been the knowledge that time would cure this illness , that her strength would revive , that she would be able to go on , to conceive and bear more sons . She had known she could survive . Now she felt no further chance for survival ; now her heart and he brain and her spirit were truly broken by the unending , senseless an . brutal tragedies of mankind . And now she knew that she had been bitterly wrong ; her mother ha . been right . Only a few months before when she had seen pity in he mother 's eyes she had rejected it summarily , wanting and needing no pity thinking her mother weak in failing to understand that her daughter ha . the stamina to brave the revolutions of fortune . But now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had told her on her tri . to Cherry Grove before her marriage : " I like your young man , Jessie , do n't misunderstand me , but he is 11-y our father ! He will always be striving and battling his way uphill spreading about him with a vast club , just as Tom Benton always has , and , for that reason he will have his enemies lurking around every corner , wit daggers and foul names , ready to stab at every opportunity . You wi never know quiet or tranquillity , Jessie . You will live forever in conflict and dissension , with struggle mixed into the very food you eat at you dinner table , poisoning the milk with which you feed your babies . That i not good for a woman , Jessie . It kills everything in her , destroys that inne spirit which must give her a sense of relaxation and security if she is to live happily and raise her children . A man 's work is the least important part of him , the menial labor that he must do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to earn a living , and when he enters his home he should wipe off the stain of that labor as he wipes the mud from his shoes . My poor baby , how I pity you ! How much misery and suffering you are rushing out to embrace . " A woman 's position had truly been decreed by nature : to manage her home , bear her children , keep her house and children and husband well and cared for . Outside this realm she should never set foot . She should not go into the arenas of conflict , demand the right to work and fight by her husband 's side , bear the blows and exhaustions and disillusionments of a man 's world of conflict . She had been so very wrong : she should have married someone like her cousin Preston Johnson ; no matter how much she had admired and loved John she should have known from what her mother had told her of the fighting and tempestuous male , she should have known from the revelations of his belligerent nature that trouble would arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all , not only their health and position but their very lives as well . Already it had cost the life of her son . And now it was costing her own Life : for she knew that there was not the strength in her ever to believe again , ever to hope for peace or an orderly and sweet life . She was only twenty-four , but she had endured the sufferings of a hundred years ; her heart had grown old and died within her breast . That breast was dead tor , the milk within her had dried . Grandmother McDowell had told her that last time at Cherry Grove , " You will have your battles after you marry that young man of yours , and you will carry scars , but you will tarry them the way my mother did , like medals bestowed for bravery . " Grandmother McDowell had misjudged her , just as she had misjudged herself . She could endure no more battles , carry no more scars . For all this she blamed no one but herself . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had thought to change the status t a wife , to make of a wife something more than a housekeeper and a rood mare ; she had thought to develop a husband 's sinews and to furthere world 's work by the use of the training and brains that God had ouchsafed her sex . And now in seven years she had willfully and blindly destroyed them all : her son , herself , her husband . For how could John survive with a dead woman by his side , a woman whose love for him had vanished because love had been burnt out of her heart by human cruelty ? he did not feel sorry for her little boy , he was dead and gone ; she feltrry only for those who were living and who would be hurt so deeply by cr death : her husband , her daughter , her father and mother . If only she-d not insisted upon working so hard at the trial , insisted upon goingcry day , exposing herself to the emotional turmoil , to the cold and atigue , she would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as deliberately as Major Cummins had killed the wolf cubs . Her husband should hate her for that . He does hate me , she thought , only he 's too kind to let me see it . Why should n't he hate me , when I killed his career too when I am responsible for his troubles , when I am the one who encou aged him to mutiny ? I wanted to be a good wife . I worked so hard to be a good wife ; now know that the best wife is the least wife . There can be no mixing of man 's world and a woman 's world ; if I had stayed out of his affairs the would not be in chaos . If only I had shown the same responsibility to th child I was carrying ; if only I had said to myself , I am pregnant , I mu not expose myself to this excitement . . . If only . . . Ah yes , she thought with a terrifying clarity , if only . Two of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long their implications . 0 what a long trail they have led me to this dreadful moment . A few hou ago I said that there is no grief that can compare with the death of a son In this too I was wrong : even greater is the grief of knowing that yo have come to the end of love and marriage with the man who was th. fulfillment of your dreams . I can not go out to California to meet him ; f can not endure the voyage ; I can not endure starting over again . I canno endure the thought of making similar mistakes , of leading us both to th same unhappy ending in everything we start . I am no good for John . have killed my love for him because I have killed everything inside m. that can feel . What will living with a dead woman do to his tortured soul Is n't it kinder to let him go to California and build a new life for himse there without me ? I can only do him harm . But can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that I am never coming ? He called me throckof his faith ; with this last rock shattered , what will happen to him O dear God , she murmured , what am I to do ? The long howls of the wolf , who was mourning her cubs , began t. penetrate the log walls of the cabin , coming nearer and nearer until Jessi felt they were inside the cabin with her . The young dogs shut in th enclosure between the two cabins howled with fright and the prairie win  --  shrieked as it whipped around the lonely buildings . She rose from the bed and began walking about the cabin , first long ways , then sideways , brushing against the wooden table and benches and , bed , hard bitter sobs welling in her throat with excruciating pain . Before her rose the whipped figure of her father standing in the dark library , facing the drawn blinds of the front windows , weeping silently because his wife had been felled by paralysis . She heard his words clearl as they came to her between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't know what it 's like not to be able to fight back . It 's like being hit in the dark : you do n't know who your adversary is  --  you do n't know where top203I urn , what to say or do . I 've never felt helpless before , but now . . . " Now she too had been struck in the dark ; she too felt helpless because i here was no way to fight back . Who was her adversary ? She heard the sound of voices , her husband 's among them . Quickly she poured some water from the earthen bowl into an enamel pan , splashing it into her feverish eyes and mouth , running it over her brow and into her hair . Her King George 's Mark , swollen and red , throbbed fiercely . She dried her hands and face with a towel and ran a comb through her hair while she heard John 's rapid footsteps approaching the cabin . She stirred the dead ashes of the fire , threw on some kindling and got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband . She knew that as a last act of kindness she must not let him perceive what she was undergoing . She must not cripple him in this expedition which was to be the most important of them all , for he needed success most now , now that he was discredited , a man without a career . She must somehow give him the strength and the courage to go forward , to be successful and re-establish himself . She saw by his face that he grasped something of what she had been suffering . She was relieved to learn that he misunderstood its source . He kissed her cheek , murmuring , " Courage , little lady . This will be the shortestseparation of all . In two months , three at the most , we will be in San Francisco together . I will be showing you the beautiful strait which leads from the Pacific to San Francisco Bay . We will be buying lumber and furniture for our home overlooking the ocean . " Jessie smiled , then with a forced note of gaiety cried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be a sight . Give me a few minutes . " She retired to the corner of the cabin beyond the fire , took a little rouge from her handbag and applied it to her cheeks , then let down her hair , brushed it , straightened the part in the center , pulled the long brown strands over her ears and pinned them low and tight at her neck . She was surprised to see how easy it was to play this game , for when all is lost what more has one to lose ; when all feeling is gone , what does it matter what feeling one pretends ? She went to her husband and asked , " There , is n't that better ? " " Much better , " he agreed . " I want my memory of you to be beautiful and serene . And now where is that cup of tea you promised me if I would come home early ? " She fixed a cup of hot black tea for him , pretending to drink a little of her own , asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Major Cummins and his wife had invited them for their farewelldinner in the settlement . Mrs. Cummins put out the few pieces of fine china that were left after her thirty years ' sojourn in this wilderness . She had roasted a chicken , and there were colored candles lighted festively on the log table . The major triumphantly brought out one of his few remaining bottles of wine . Jessie talked of things of which she had no thought before , or memory after they left her lips , but the moments began to seem endless , and toward seven o'clock she thanked the Cumminses fo their kindness and walked back to the cabin with her husband . This was their last hour together . She prayed for the strength to carry i off . But when he took her in his arms , when he set her beside him on th. edge of the bed , when he began speaking of how much he would miss her of how he would think of her night and day until they could be togethe . in San Francisco , all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She became pale and lifeless . Some part of her maintained i consciousness , continued to go through the motions of being kind , of pr tending that nothing had happened between them , of fulfilling that momentof love so important to a couple that is to be separated by countl miles and minutes . It was here at last that she failed , that her pretenses broke down . Fo her lips were dry and ashen , her body was dry and ashen . She knew tha in death there could be no creating of life , not even the going through o the motions ; that love can penetrate , love can be rhythmical , but in deat the brain and the heart and the pulse and the womb are closed ; there c.  --  be no entrance of life into death . She lay on the bed silent , her eyes closed . He tried to talk to her : t. comfort her over the loss of their child , to minimize the hardship and th. extent of their coming separation , to hearten her by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new life they would build , the nesons they would create . She heard the sound of his voice but none of th  --  words ; her strength had vanished . She was spent . This was the greatest o her failures : that she must send this unfortunate man out into the track less snows of the Rockies , into hardship , privation and ever constan danger of death , send him out heavy of heart , beaten before he started . She felt his kiss on her cheek , heard his murmured good-by , manage . to pull herself up halfway to run her fingers down his silken beard , wish him well . But the actual moment of his going , the closing of the doo behind him , she did not know . She was lying in a half-torpor when she heard Mrs. Cummins calling t. her many times . She rose , wrapped a heavy shawl around her shoulde and opened the door . An army sergeant was standing beside Mrs. Cum mins , his face caked with perspiration and dirt , his uniform crushed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them blankly , she hear Mrs. Cummins say :  | " This is Sergeant O'Leary , come with a message from St. Louis . " The sergeant stepped forward , opened a dispatch case at his side , and handed her a sealed letter . " From General Kearny , " he said . " I was ordered to deliver it in the fastest possible time . " She tore open the envelope , but was unable to read the message in the dark . She bade the sergeant enter . Then she went to the fire and read the message in the dying flames : DEAR MISS JESSIE : You were right , we can not destroy our friends without destroying ourselves . The whole trial was a dreadful mistake . Please come back with this courier . I want to beg your forgiveness for the harm I have done you and your family . If you can not come , wo n't you please send a message that you forgive me ? Your old and devoted friend , STEPHEN WATTS KEARNYJessie reread the note , going from the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why was General Kearny doing this ? And why had he not done it before she left St. Louis ? He had been there all the time at Jefferson Barracks , but he had sent no word , not even when her twin had died . Why now . . . ? She turned to the army officer who was standing stiffly , his cap crushed tinder his arm . " Why had you to ride so hard ? " she asked . " Why is General Kearny in such haste ? " The sergeant wiped the dust off his lower lip by running his left thumb roughly across it . " The general be dying , mum . The doctor say he has only a few hours to live . The general ordered I should bring you back with me . He says he must see you before he die . " Jessie stood silently , the letter hanging loosely at her side . If only this ad happened before , she thought , I could have felt there was some dencyleft in the world . But now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't want to die with me on his conscience . After breaking my husband and killing my son , he wants a cheap and easy forgiveness. the sergeant she said , " I can not go back with you . Tell Generalcarny it is impossible . " " I do n't know what 's in the message , mum , " he answered , " but the ncral told me if I could n't bring you I was to bring an answer . " " There is no answer . " The man shifted from one foot to the other .   " Please , " he said , " I been with the general many a year now . I fit with him agin the Indians , I was with him on the march to California . I been his dispatch bearer and he been my friend . He 's terribly unhappy , mum , said , Just ask her to say those few words , O'Leary . Just ask her to say she forgive me . ' " Jessie stood cold and impassive . " Tell the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands between us . " The sergeant opened his mouth to speak , but the misery in her eyes stopped him . He pulled himself up slowly , awkwardly , then saluted , left the cabin . She stood there , her brain as black as the starless night . After a time shputa log on the fire , then pulled an end of the heavy bench to the heart and sat down , her bony elbows digging into her thighs , the palms of her hands holding her eyelids tight-closed and stretched wide apart , blotting out all memory . Here she sat while time passed , the minutes , the hours , the bleak black minutes and hours that stretched ahead endlessly . She was aroused by the swift gallop of a horseback rider . The lightning beats thundered up to her doorstep , were pulled to an abrupt stop . There was a sound of something hitting the earth , the door of her cabin was thrown open . Jessie looked up to see John standing there , disheveled , grim . He threw the door shut hard behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiercely about her . " Jessie , I could n't go . I could n't leave you this way . I know how ill you arc , and how wretched . You need me with you . I am not going away . I have given up the expedition . I put someone else in charge . They leave at dawn . Come , let us pack our things . We will go to St. Louis , and then on to New York . I promised you we would never be separated again , and we never will . " His voice was hoarse . She stared at him , unbelieving . This was the one sacrifice nobody could have asked or expected him to make ; it left him once again without a rudder or a future . To one of his intense pride it would have been easier to throw away his life than to throw away this opportunity to re-establish himself . From the ravaged lines in his face she could tell something of the struggle he had undergone to achieve this unselfishness . But his love for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further suffering he had been willing to face contempt for his failure to carry through . He had known he could never explain or justify himself ; he had known what his bruised pride would be forced to undergo . He was willing to face this punishment for her sake . A little feeling crept back into her tired body and nerves.  | " You would give up . . . the expedition . . . when it means so much to you ? " " It means nothing to me , " he cried . " You are the only one who means anything to me . You are my love and my life . I can not leave you alone flow . " " But so much is at stake , " she whispered . " If you are successful , you have a life to live again . Without it you have nothing . . . " He ran his fingers roughly , supplicatingly over her face . " How wrong you are , Jessie ! I have you to turn to ! You are my future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can rise again , I can do anything . Our love is more important than any expedition or any chance for success . Do n't you understand that , darling ? Do n't you understand that we must go on together , always side by side ? " She took his dirt-lined hand and kissed the pocket of its warm , curved halm . If John were willing to make this sacrifice for her , then her love and marriage had not been a failure . " You would do this for me ? " she persisted . " You would give up the only thing that brought you back to life ? You would let some other man ommand your party , find the new pass and lay out the railroad route ? You would give up everything you hoped would grow out of this work because I am ill and unhappy and I need you ? " His face showed hurt astonishment . " But of course , Jessie ! How can you doubt it ? Did my love seem such a shallow thing ? Did you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect you ? Ah , Jessie , how little you really know me ! How little you have known of how much I love you , and what our marriage has meant to me . " She was crying now , she could feel the hot tears streaming down her cheeks ; and these hot tears seemed like rivers of strength pouring courage and hope back into her body . She slipped off the edge of the bench onto the floor beside him . She wrapped her arms tightly and securely about his neck , her mouth clinging to his . True love never died ; it surmounted all obstacles , it was indestructible ; all else perished : hopes , plans , dreams , illusions , ambition and accomplishment , kindness , good will , even sweet charity . Yet one was able to tarry on because the greatest force of all survived . So often it seemed to have worn thin , to have turned sour , to have been beaten out of shape : yet , miracle of miracles , love survived ; it could conquer death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she murmured against his lips . " I understand . All is well . I love you too , more than I ever have before . You can go now , you can he happy and sure about me . I will be well again , quickly . I will be in St. Louis within two days , then go on to New York and catch the first ship for California . Yes , my darling , I will be in San Francisco before you , awaitingyour arrival as eagerly as any woman ever waited for her love . You still have an hour to daybreak . You can make camp in time to give the order for the march . Good-by , and may God keep you . " She stood in the open doorway watching her husband gallop off into the blackness of the night . When the last reverberation of the hoofbeats had died away she turned back to the cabin and set about packing her bags . With the first light of dawn she mounted her horse and headed east into the rising sun on the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consecrate a HearthLE MID-MARCH WINDS were icy and the wooden planks of the wharflippery under foot when Jessie and Lily boarded the S.S.

They were determined to I ) ( ' lighthearted about the parting , hustling about the cabin unpacking alises and trying to make it seem a little like home . They spoke in quick ashes of how soon California could become a state , what John 's chances cre of being elected the first senator ; of the possibility that there really %% as a large quantity of gold , and how quickly a genuine gold rush would , , ( ttle the new territory . But at last there was no more time for impersonal talk , and father and daughter embraced , murmuring words of farewell . She stood alongside of the rail while orders were shouted ; there were the noises of the hauling up of the gangplank , of winches being turned. lie ship pulled slowly into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wharf in the blackness , she turned and went down to her cabin . The t%% o kerosene lamps were swinging from their hooks in the ceiling beams . Lily was in her berth , lying wide-eyed . " Have n't you gone to sleep yet , child ? " Jessie asked . " No , Mother , I 'm frightened . Wo n't you come in bed with me ? " " Yes , dear , I 'll undress immediately . " It took only a moment to slip out of her clothes and don a warm flantIl nightgown . Outside the two square portholes a gale was raging as Iltc ship pitched its way forward . She got into the berth with Lily ; they otnforted each other in the darkness with talk about the future . Jessie hied to imbue the child with her own excitement and impatience to California . P210The first three days were stormy . When she dressed and went out . deck on the fourth morning off the coast of Florida , she found the su shining brightly and the ocean tranquil . Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything would be done to keep her comfortable . She sat on deck i a wicker lounge chair with the sun beating strong on her face , while I , il went forward to watch the sailors paint the gear . The sun had a soothin quality ; so did the quiet and the blue skies , the flight of gulls out fro the coast of Florida and the Bahamas . In the heat of the day she too long naps ; at sunset , with the skies flaming cerise and indigo , she walke  --  for an hour about the deck , storing up strength for the difficult da ahead when she must cross Panama . Though she had planned to go around Cape Horn on the S.S. Fre donia which had left in January , her father had insisted that she have more rest before she made the journey , that John could not be in Californiabefore March , and that it would be better if he arrived there first and prepared a place for them . In addition he wanted her to wait a lemonths so that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rumors that gold had been discovered in California had reached Washington toward the beginning of 1848 , but no one in the East had given them any serious credence ; in December of 1848 a tea caddy filled with gold nuggets was delivered to President Polk . This first concrete evidence of gold had excited the easily inflammable and **25;9051;TOOLONG , who prepared to get to California as fastthey could and by any means available . Though most people in the East i did not consider one tea caddy of gold to be proof of a gold strike , th. government used the additional inducement of gold on the west coast to establish regular steamship connections with California . The S.S. Californialeft to go around the Horn and was to remain on the west coas plying between San Francisco and Panama City . The S.S. Panama left New York on March 13 , 1849 , for Chagres , the port of entry to Panama on the Atlantic coast . Jessie , Lily and the other passengers would cross th Isthmus , which had just been opened to travel , and catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco to pick them up . In the evenings she read from the volumes on agriculture she had bought in Washington in order to prepare herself to be a farmer 's wife . She did not think that John should become a farmer ; he lacked not only the training , but the temperament as well ; yet the important thing was to establish a permanent home in California . When Elizabeth Benton had heard of her daughter 's plans to erect a log cabin in the Santa Cruz mountains outside of San Francisco , she had taken Jessie 's hand and murmured , " Remember that you were born on land that had never beenP211t , ought or sold , a crown grant for military services to my grandfather 's f. they . Not only should your home be inherited , Jessie , but your servants slid money as well . The gods are slow to consecrate a new hearth . ' . nl 're not strong enough to endure the hardships of wild country like l : lifornia . Let John complete his railroad expedition , return to WashiI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a great deal happier . " On the ride to Cherry Grove eight years before , seventeen-year-oldJssie had shrugged off her mother 's warnings as unimportant . But this a as a chastened Jessie who had already endured much of the worst her mother had predicted . " Someone has to build a hearth at the beginning , Mother , " she had . plied , " or the rest of us would n't be able to inherit it . " John would eventually find other activities more interesting to him th an farming , but first their home place must be established . If her mother kid been right in saying that " the gods are slow to consecrate a new hearth , " then the more reason to begin at once . At the end of two weeks of sailing , when she had her first sight of palm ' tees and the tropical growth of Chagres , it was another wrench to know hat she would have to leave Captain Schenck , her last connection with ome . She awakened while it was still dark , dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night before . With Lily 's hand hitched tightly in hers , she went on deck in time to watch the tropical inrise , the sun bursting above the horizon as though it were shot out of cannon , day breaking with the same roar with which the sea was breakigon the white beach of Chagres . It was her first view of the tropics ; mom a distance it looked friendly enough , with the palm trees fringing e sand bar and the heavy green growth along the river . When Captain henck came forward , Jessie turned a smiling face toward him . " So the voyage is ended , Captain , " she said . " You have made it pleastitfor me and my little girl . " Captain Schenck did not return her smile . Anxiously he said , " Then t me perform one last service for Senator Benton and Colonel Fremont . .. not attempt to cross Panama . The country is rotten with Chagres v.  --  r . People are dying in the boats and on the trails . The food is abomalhle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been opened . " The unexpected opposition to her continuing onward to meet John ought sharply to her mind the scene at the Delaware Indian Reserva-n where she had come so close to losing her love , her husband andrything that had meaning in her life . She valued it doubly now for ving so nearly lost it . Any thought that she might fail in her efforts toher husband in San Francisco brought back the intensity of those pair-fraught hours in Major Cummins ' cabin .   " I am certain I will be able to stand the passage , Captain , " she at* swered serenely . The ship was rolling under them and she was anxious to get ashore She returned to her cabin for her coat and purse . Having left her do . ajar , she heard the heavy stomping of a man 's boots . An unfamiliar voi  --  r cried : " I ai n't taking the responsibility for any Washington fine lady acre Panama . She 'll object to the Indians havin ' no clothes on , she 'll ma trouble , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't heard the phrase " fine lady " since the day she had left M ' English 's Academy . She gave her hat a final touch , resolutely swish . her long dark skirt out behind her , opened the door and faced t stranger . The man looked at her slender , ivory-tinted face , at her fray , ' figure , at the burning hazel eyes , and said stumblingly , " Why , you ' not a fine lady at all ; you 're just a poor thin woman ! " She handed Lily to a sailor who carried her down the ship 's rope la. der and placed her in the tender that was bobbing on the bay . Swingi from side to side Jessie manipulated the ladder , edged herself into t. tender . The little boat made its way to shore . AT THE WATERFRONT she was almost overcome by the stench of stale fis , tea and cinnamon ; but she felt at home with the throngs of men who we jamming the beach ready to start their journey overland , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft Spanish intermingled with the Fren patois , Indians and Negroes talking their own dialects , the America and English swearing at everybody in their haste to arrange for transpo tation . She thought with a smile , if one were going to be a world tra eler , St. Louis was an ideal training ground . Jessie and Lily and their baggage were to be transported up the fi eight miles of the Chagres River in one of the deep-water boats with number of Americans who had been wise enough to arrange for passag Within two hours after landing she was on her way . The banks of t river were low and covered with jungle growth to the water 's edge , whe white and scarlet flowers rose from the tangled green . By midafternool the chugging motor had covered the eight miles and swerved into shor they had had no food , no tarpaulin to protect them from the fierce hea no water which she felt safe in drinking , though they were painful parched , no way to take care of their personal needs . She disembark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language , that theyp213uld be transferred to the narrow dugouts which were tied to the thickchanging branches . Each of the dugouts was manned by naked . , groes and Indians . Jessie felt Lily 's hand clutching her own . " Do n't be frightened by their noise , " she reassured her , " they 're laughandyelling out of excitement . It is only a three-day voyage up the hallows , and then we will be out on the trail . " A man in uniform appeared in the clearing . He came to her and said , 1'ni Captain Tucker ; I received a letter that you were coming . I havee company 's boat ready for you and your daughter . I 'm sorry I ca n't  --  along ; you will be the only woman aboard , but the native crew is re-.alle , they frequently carry my wife to company headquarters .  --  " You mean we wo n't have to travel in those dugouts ? " asked Jessie , .1lizing how far her heart had sunk at the sight of the savages . Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your consternation . It I think we can keep you comfortable . The company has tent camps at ular intervals up the river and my carriers have informed them that at are coming . Will you get into the boat now ; there is no time to lose you are to make the first camp by nightfall . " She thanked him heartily . The Jamaica Negroes pushed out against . heavy current , poling slowly upstream while they chanted in rhythm . nnetimes they traveled in midstream where the sun was so hot it burnedc skin like a fire , but more often they stayed close to the shore , gliding ily under the arching trees and canopies of flowering vines . When ey could go no further because of growths of jungle creeper , Jessie and r daughter would have to go ashore and sit in the midst of the dank cell foliage while the boatmen jumped into the water and with their ) g knives cut a trail along the riverbank . Then they would come back r Jessie , and half pull , half push the boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screeches of the tropical jungle rds . They made their first landing while the sun was still bright . In a small firing a company tent with a wooden floor had been set up . She wonredwhy they had stopped so early , but she soon knew the answer , for slit came upon them with the swiftness of a falling star . The native boys uie a small fire outside the tent flaps as a protection against the animalsd the deadly dews , then brought her some cooked food , but she prerednot to eat it , feeding Lily and herself a few cookies and an apple - ich she had brought from the ship . After the child had fallen asleep , sic lay awake in her narrow iron cot listening to the discordant night ices of the tropics , to what seemed an unceasing rush of sound all and the tent . There was no sleep in her , for she was possessed by the irony that she whose husband had marked and broken more trails across the contin than any other living American should be denied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead into . this aboriginal nightmare . All time she had worked on the three reports , watched John 's maps gro she had had the intensest personal interest in each mile of the terrain , f she had always thought that she would one day travel these routes . S had not only been prepared over a number of years , but had been anxio to encounter the hazards of the covered wagon , the plains , the sno bound mountain passes , the hostile Indians , the moisture-parched d erts ; all these images and the attendant hardships had been part of thoughts since she had been a child . Yet here she was set down in midst of country and hardship which she had never anticipated , and which she was in no way prepared . Here she was on the first real voya of her life , traveling without husband or friend by her side , in coup so fantastic that not even the Spanish explorers had done it descripti justice . This was land upon which no one she had ever known had 1 . eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Algo . sitting by her blue-painted Delaware wagon , about to set off on Oregon Trail . If only John 's eyes had seen this country , John 's draw ' pencil sketched its character , she would have felt more at home . The next morning they were off at the crack of dawn , being poled the stiff current . She told Lily stories of how the first white men who h invaded Peru had carried their loot down this very river on their way the Atlantic Ocean and back to Spain . The banks were brilliant w ' white and scarlet perch flowers ; the native boys jumped into the river cool off or cut food from the bank , but Jessie and Lily suffered ago of heat , hunger , thirst and the other pressures to which the body is h . The nights were dank with mist ; the cries of sudden death in jungle gave the journey a mortal aspect . She was grateful for the floo tents and cots ; without this barest of protection she doubted their than of continuing . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trail , she now realized that her sympathy had been cerebr her husband had suffered from the cold while she was suffering from heat , he had been victim to the sparseness of vegetation while she oppressed by its lushness , yet now that she was experiencing these mom tars tortures with her own flesh she at last had an intimation of agonies that must have racked the body of John Fremont . On the morning of the fourth day they reached Gorgona , a little dement where they transferred from the shallow Chagres to the trail o the mountains . Though it was only eight in the morning the sun was a knife under the eyelids . The alcalde was down at the landing beach invite her to his home for breakfast . His house was built on stilts witP215Ill itched roof of palm fronds and wattled sides . They had no sooner , ded themselves at the rattan table than native boys brought in two big eking dishes and popped off the covers . Jessie let out an exclamation f horror , for in the big casserole there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honored guests , " said the alcalde , his eyes gleaming bile he rubbed his hands in anticipation . " Baked ring-tailed monkey d boiled iguana lizard . " Her stomach slowly seemed to rise to her throat . One look at Lily 's cc told her that the child would not be able to eat the monkey . The ) tiled strength for the arduous three-day trip over the mountains . She membered how John had preferred the pangs and weakness of hunger eating a portion of their pet dog . She decided that her husband was re fastidious than she . To her daughter she murmured : " Remember what Sam Weller used to say : Weal pie ware a good ing when you knew it ware n't made of kittens . ' " They both ate a little of the monkey , but the lizard was too much for cm . Then the alcalde took them to the clearing which marked the benningof the mule track to Panama . Part of Jessie 's baggage was placeda mule , the rest of it on a cow which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Will you please put my daughter on a ule immediately in front of mine , and make sure the animal is kept ere ? " " He stay dere , lady , " laughed the baggageman . " No place to go else . " There were fifty mules , a half-dozen cows and thirty men in the caran . The native leader gave a fierce whoop which was echoed up and wn the line , the mules began to move beneath them . The track folwedthe contour of the mountains , up to the top of a hill and down ain into the valley on the twenty-one-mile pilgrimage to Panama City . he mule steps that had been cut by hand into the mountainside were rely more than four feet wide , and at the edge one looked down a uusand feet into jungle growth . Mango trees and alders were packed lid along the trail , topped by towering palms and cocoanuts . In spite the intense glare of the tropical sun , it was dark under the green roof ; . sic kept looking upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anches , then a few steps more and it would be dark green again , with a dden burst of rain falling down through the matted foliage . There werebridges across the narrow streams ; the mules jumped them , and scvalof the travelers were dumped head first into the water . She was ankful that both she and Lily were experienced riders , and was proud , she rode behind the slender form of her daughter , at the way the ild was withstanding their travels , the constantly changing tempera- tures , the strange sights , steady hours of movement , the hardships of hu ger , heat and personal discomfort . The first night they slept in a tent with a wooden floor , but on t second night there was only a filthy Indian hut . Jessie took two blank . out of her boxes , rolled Lily in one and herself in the other and slept t sleep of exhaustion , impervious to the lizards , snakes and hundreds insects which crawled across them in the course of the night . The su rise was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sea blossoms , and beyond she saw as Balboa had seen from this very peak fore her the Pacific Ocean at her feet . She ardently wished that To Benton could be sharing with her this first view of the Pacific . Several hours before the sixth nightfall they reached Panama Ci The trail came out of the mountains some distance from the walled ci with its ancient cathedral . Her first sight of the cathedral roof and sp ' of inlaid mother-of-pearl made her think that she had fallen victim the Chagres fever , after all . At the trail 's end there were Indian carrie one of whom took her on his back , and another Lily , and carried the . over the shallow water of the bay and across the sand reef to the entran. of Panama City . She walked on the ancient roadway through the railgate , entered the walled town with its weather-stained old houses wide balconies leaning out so far they almost closed over the narro passages . In the streets were trotting donkeys carrying bundles of lea and water jars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of finding a sleepy little Spanish town with a few nativ wandering the streets , she found the place a bedlam of stranded Ame cans , several hundred of them camping on the hillside above the ci others hustling and jostling through the streets . While waiting for t Indian carriers to bring her baggage to the Cathedral Square , fro which point she would seek a hotel , she inquired of the group of Ame cans who were wearing the western garb she knew so well from St. Lou ' " Why are so many of you men here ? " A lean , gray-haired man in a leather jacket and buckskin pants stepp  --  forward and said , " Ai n't you heard the news , ma'am , the ship ai n't co ing back to Panama . " Stupefied , having visions of Lily and herself camping endlessly on t. hills above Panama , she could only gasp : " Ship not coming back ? B why ? What do you mean ? " A young man dressed in a black business suit much the worse for we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in California , ma'am ? the ships ' crews have deserted and gone into the gold fields . The C fornia was due a month ago , but it never got here . " P217She looked from face to face anxiously , then asked , " Deserted their hips ? " There was a moment of silence while the men looked at each other . Then everyone began talking at once . " Yes , ma'am ! All the rumors was t tie ! Millions of dollars ' worth of gold ! People picking it up on the mountinsidein sacks ! Getting rich overnight ! Here we 're rottin ' in Panama : ity , and millions of dollars of gold laying all over California just waitigto be picked up . " The verification that there was gold in California meant little to her xccpt that she and Lily would be marooned in Panama City . She asked jir first man who had spoken , the gray-haired one , if he knew anything bout the hotels in Panama . He assured her that they were verminfested , that there were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming toward her a Spanish woman with white hair under a uck mantilla . Trailing her were several native boys . She came to Jessie d said : " I am Madame Arce , cousin of the American minister from New ranada , General Herran . He wrote to me that you were coming and told r of the many happy hours he had spent in your home in Washington . is now my privilege to return that hospitality . Will you come with me , aflame Fremont ? " She followed Madame Arce across the square to a great barrack of house with twenty-foot ceilings , and windows as big as barn doors . hen she was led to her bedroom she found it furnished with a lounge vered in a blue damask , two hammocks , and crystal chandeliers with x lights . Madame Arce made available to her a velvet-footed girl with soft laugh , named Candelarias . Jessie 's relief at being rescued was so . at that she murmured to Lily , " Now I know how your father must ve felt when he found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a tropical version of Tom Benton 's home erlooking the Mississippi , built around an enclosed patio , with the rs red-tiled . She stepped out onto the wide gallery which surroundedhouse and overlooked the cathedral . A few moments later there was nock at her door and Candelarias asked if she would like to have a h before dinner . Jessie called to Lily and they walked to an outside tlthouse much like her father 's shower on C Street , for on a high ledge rc were containers , ranging from small vases to four-foot-high jars et ! with water from the well . The smaller jars were dumped on them three grinning young girls , then the larger jars were overturned asbecame accustomed to the coldness of the water. ' he days passed , a week , two weeks , three weeks . Jessie spent many rs with Madame Arce in the coolness of the back garden speaking in the Spanish they both loved , walking along the ramparts of the old to at sunset and watching the twenty-foot tide crashing over the reefs . the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom she knew from her own ship and those with whom she had beco acquainted during her first hour in Panama . They were growing m. desperate with each passing day . There was no food to be bought , th were living on the salted foods they had carried with them , and dea from disease was an everyday occurrence in the camps that dotted t. hillsides . A month passed and still there was no ship and no news of any ; t men were becoming frightened that they would all die here in Panai that there would be no chance for them to escape . Jessie was well cared for , yet she too was growing uneasy . There h been no word from John since he had left her side that early morning the Delaware Indian Reservation . Some five months had passed sine then ; if all had gone well , her husband and his party should be safely San Francisco . He would be waiting for her , scanning the sea for her rival . He would be fearful lest she had encountered difficulties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panama , where strong in were stricken and died within a few hours . She knew the heartbreak worrying about a loved one ; that had been her lot over the years ; s did not want her husband to undergo this slow torture . And yet the was nothing she could do but sit and wait and let the days succeed ca other as painlessly as possible . THE RAINY SEASON came down like a thunderclap , filling the streets the little town as though they were shallow pools . Madame Arce 's ho was wet , the floors , ceilings wet ; lanes of damp ooze trickled down twenty-foot walls , while outside the rains filled the air with sickening halations . Jessie caught cold , and with it a racking cough . Madame A l insisted that she remain in bed , while Candelarias kept a fire lighted the room in a vain attempt to dry out the walls . She lay in the hammo her dreams shattered by grotesque pictures of screaming , naked sava dancing around her , taunting her with being a fine lady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where freeziti men fell forward into the snow . Another month passed , and then one night she was awakened by the booming of a cannon which told her , even as the noise tore her from hit dream , that an American ship had arrived . She rushed out on the h4 cony to behold a wild scene . It was a bright moonlight night and onlyP219ul leading down from the hills was filled with singing and shouting mericans who were crying out with joy as they hurried toward the . mparts . The Indians too had been awakened , and they were singing and dancing in sympathy . On the balcony of every house were shrouded figures in their night clothes watching the scene . Even before she could icturn to her room to begin dressing and packing , there was another boom from a cannon ; a second American ship had dropped anchor in the harbor . Breathlessly she dressed Lily and herself , began throwing clothes into her suitcases , then went out on the balcony again to search for the ship its the light of day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uniform of the United States Navy stride across the square . She rushed down the patio stairs , across the red tile , and threw open the heavy door . With a glad cry she grasped the hand of Lieutenant Fitzhugh Beale , who had been a friend of Colonel Fremont 's in California , fought with him in the inquest , testified for him at the court-martial and been their guest in the Benton home in Washington . " Ah , Mrs. Fremont ! " he cried . " I had surmised you were stranded here , waiting for the California . I 've just come down on her , with naval dispatches and samples of gold dust . " " Have you heard news of Colonel Fremont ? " " No . " She led him to the back garden , then told him of her voyage while he sipped a warm drink . Lieutenant Beale was blue-eyed , blond , about thirty , with a long , horselike face . He loved danger and movement and all ever changing panorama : a congenital bachelor , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimates he was known as " Beale of the steady hands and wandering feet . " Jessie saw that he was uneasy , that lu had something to tell her . He asked permission to light a cigar , gazing at the burnt match for a moment before speaking . " I must hurry on to Chagres and deliver my papers to the next ship leaving for New York . Every possible facility has been given me to make he Panama crossing as quickly and easily as possible . Mrs. Fremont , ou look ill ; I do n't think you should expose yourself to more hardship. urge you to return to Chagres with me ; there will be a fast ship for New York , and I will arrange for you to be taken care of . " Her thoughts colliding , she asked : " But why should I return to New York now , when there is a ship to ' site me to San Francisco ? " " Mrs. Fremont , San Francisco has gone crazy wild . The original tilers have rushed off for the gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i excitement to get away and find their millions in gold . The hotels are dirty and cold and jammed , there is no help to be had except India ! and Chinese , and people will tell you that their time is worth fifty dolla a minute . San Francisco is n't a town , it is n't even a village , it 's just a se ' tlement of delirious maniacs living in shanties and knock-together cabin . waiting for the moment when they can get away to the gold fields . Ther is no water , no adequate food , no sanitary equipment . The streets a flowing mud streams impossible to cross . Why , I have seen men try t. pave them with bales of cotton and bags of flour . There is no lump . available , no brick or stone , nothing with which you and the colon . could build a house . The shanty towns are full of fever and cholera , an . the death rate is terrifying . Mrs. Fremont , I beg you not to risk arrivin. alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or thre white women there . " She watched the young lieutenant puff animatedly on his cigar , feelin ; a familiar paralyzing fear clutch at her heart . " Please tell me the news , Lieutenant Beale , " she murmured . " Yo said that you had not heard from Colonel Fremont . " The lieutenant took the cigar out of his mouth . " It is true , I have not heard from him . But I have heard about him . There has been trouble , Mrs. Fremont . Your husband 's expedition never got over the Rockies . The fur traders and the Indians warned them not to go in , told them that the snow and the cold had never been so intense , that it was impossibltocross the Rockies at that point . But Colonel Fremont insisted . He sai. there must be a pass on the thirty-eighth parallel . . . and he ran int . the most impenetrable part of the Rockies , in the worst winter within the memory of anyone who knows that country . " Her body as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockies , she asked , " My husband , is he safe ? " After a barely imperceptible pause , Lieutenant Beale replied , " W do n't know . The colonel engaged Bill Williams to guide him . William wanted to take a southerly route , but your husband felt that would defe , the purpose of the expedition , that he had to find a central pass for th railroad . The colonel and Williams quarreled ; they never found a pass They pushed deeper and deeper into the snows until they could go n. farther . Then they turned back . . . they lost their mules and suppli .. . . . The men began to die along the trail . . . " " But my husband . What about Colonel Fremont ? " His head down , Lieutenant Beale repeated , " We do n't know , Miss Jessie . " " Some of the party must have gotten out . Else how would you know ? " " The colonel sent out a relief party with Williams , Brackenridge , KingP221and Creutzfeldt to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starved to death , but Williams , Brackenridge and Creutzfeldt got through . om them we learned about the disaster to the expedition . " Twisting her lace handkerchief between her taut fingers , Jessie cried , " I f the relief party got out , then surely they must have sent back supplies . ' I lie rest of the men must be safe ? " Lieutenant Beale shook his head slowly . " The three men were almost tit ad before they reached a settlement . They did not have the strength It ) take back relief , and there was no one at the settlement who could go into the mountains . A runner carried the news to Kit Carson at Taos , but 1t would have taken too long for Carson to organize relief and get up into the Rockies . The rest of the expedition would have had to get out on its own resources . " " Then there is no word about Colonel Fremont ? " " None . " " He was still alive when the Williams party was sent out for relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What was his condition then ? " " His leg was badly frozen . " " There has been no word from anybody left in the mountains ? " " None . Williams says they could not have lived more than a few ays ... " She stalked agitatedly about the patio . " My husband could not have perished in the snows ! He faced greater ardships when he crossed the Sierras in ' 44 . If Williams could get out ith a relief party , then Colonel Fremont can get out with the rest of the condition . Neither the snows nor the mountains could ever kill him . ' here is no man in the world better equipped to survive . . . " Lieutenant Beale put his arm about her . " The expedition is ended , Miss Jessie ; the equipment was abandoned , t one got over the mountains and no one got through to California . hose who survived are returning east to St. Louis . If Colonel Fremont me out of the Rockies , he will be in St. Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you back across Panama . There are merchantmen in c harbor at Chagres ; they will not be leaving before we reach there . iss Jessie , I want you to pack your things and return with me . I will it you on a ship for New York . " Pale now , and coughing , she faced Lieutenant Beale determinedly . ' ou believe that my husband is dead ? " i Ie did not answer . " No , do n't be afraid for me . I have gone through this before . Tell r if you think there is any chance that my husband is alive "   When Lieutenant Beale could not garner the courage to speak , sh said , " Very well , you think he is dead .

" Though he maintained that the reason he wanted her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew that his real reason was that he believed she was going on to San Francisco to meet a ma who was buried in the glacial snows of the highest Rockies . " I thank you for your kindness , Lieutenant ; I know how much yo have my interest at heart ; but you are mistaken . Colonel Fremont mu be in San Francisco by now ; he will be waiting ; I promised I would me him there . " He bowed . " Please think it over , Miss Jessie . " After he had left she sat rocking in a chair . So the fourth expeditio. had failed ! For her own part she did not suffer too greatly over the fail ure : the men had met insuperable obstacles , that was all ; they had don . their best , but it had not been enough in the face of the unscalabl Rockies . But how would John take it : the loss of the money that h ' admirers in St. Louis had invested , the loss of his opportunity to r  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he not consid. it a matter of personal inadequacy , count the failure his own , be strickby it ? Would he not fear the criticism and the disgrace of having some the men perish under his leadership ? Would this make it impossible fo him ever to start out again ? And here again was the phantom of her husband 's death . She coul. believe it this time no more than the last , but in the closeness of th warm spring morning she was gripped by the terrifying realization tha John might have been seriously injured . Bill Williams had reported hi suffering from a badly frozen leg . The mules had frozen to death or bee killed for food ; there was no way for him to come down the vastness . the Rockies except on his own feet , for his men would be too weak carry him . What then if he could no longer drag that frozen leg ? He w not stronger than the forces of nature : because he had forced the Sierr there was no reason to believe he was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceive that her beloved was dea. yet there might be no way for him to get through to California . He woul. return to St. Louis or Washington to recoup his health . By what tokc should she go up to San Francisco , pestilential mudhole caught in th. hysteria of the gold rush , where she had neither friend nor relative , wher. she would be alone with her daughter , with no place to go and nothin : to do , and no husband to meet her ? P223She was so homesick that the tears coursed unrestrainedly down her ! leeks . Would anyone blame her if she let herself be persuaded that there was no sense in going on to San Francisco ? True , she had promised to fleet her husband there ; but if he had been unable to reach San Franisco , if he were even now on his way to St. Louis , what possible sense ould there be in her going on ? Why persist in this cruel voyage ? They would have no way of communicating with each other , to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether John would come verland in the summer to join her . The best that could happen would H. confusion and heartbreak and more months of separation . She got out of the chair and walked upstairs to the balcony . The cooler hit refreshed her a little . The Cathedral Square was abandoned but the ire gleamed with oriental splendor . And standing there , feeling descratelyalone , wanting her husband 's arms about her as she had never wanted them before , not even in the darkest hours in St. Louis wheneveryone had thought he was dead , she knew that she could not return to New York . She had not said , " I 'll meet you in San Francisco if cir-umstances permit , " or " providing I 'm sure you will be there to meete , " or " if I can make it . " She had made a categorical promise , and romises were made to be kept , the hard ones as well as the easy ones . If he kept this promise , under these almost unendurable circumstances , hen not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promes , but even more important , she herself would know that she could rep them . HE FINISHED HER PACKING . Madame Arce came to her bedroom to exressher happiness that she would at last go on to her own country and cr own people . Jessie embraced the older woman , murmuring softly , If not for you I might have died here . How am I to repay your kind-cm ? " Madame Arce replied , smiling , " In the Spanish language we do not . Re the word repay . " They were still murmuring gracious words to each other when antiterclamor arose in the town . A new party of Americans had just come If the trail from Chagres . With them had arrived a carefully guarded lnited States mail sack , its destination San Francisco . A portion of thewould surely be addressed to the Americans who had been detained n Panama City these several months . The head baggageman turned the sack over to the American reprerntativein Panama City , a Central American consul who had no authority to do otherwise than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco . When the Americans learned that mail had come in they thronged the official 's office demanding that he open the pouch . Jessie rushed through the courtyard to join the excited group in front of the consul 's office . The consul kept repeating , " I decline to usurp functions . It is locked . It can not be opened until it reaches San Fran . cisco . Do you not see it is marked , Destination San Francisco ' ? I have no authority . . . " The Americans had no intention of waiting several weeks for newt. of their families while the locked mail sack accompanied them to Sari Francisco . " We 'll take the responsibility ! " they shouted . " We 'll sign a petition ! Every last one of us will sign for his letter ! " If John had come down from the mountains alive there would be is letter from him in that sack . She was positive the letter was there , and she was determined to have it . She pushed her way through the crowd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wants news of the colonel , f Open that blasted sack and give us our mail . " The consul took one last look at the men 's faces , then gazed into Jessie 's eyes and said quickly , " Very well , but I do not take responsibility , I do not cut open this sack ! You must appoint a committee and the com.:T mittee must take responsibility . " The pouch was torn open before the consul had his last words out .. Someone cried , " For you , Mrs. Fremont ! " With tears half blinding her , Jessie saw that she had a fat envelope from Taos addressed in her hus band 's handwriting , another from her father in Washington . She ,  --  stumbled across the square , ran up the patio stairs , tore open John 's en velope and read : Taos , New Mexico January 27 , 1849 MY VERY DEAR WIFE : I write to you from the house of our good friend Kit Carson . Th ' morning a cup of chocolate was brought to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxury , I pleased myself in imagining how grali. fled you would be in picturing me here in Kit 's care , whom you will fancy . constantly endeavoring to make me comfortable . . . She could read no further , for tears were falling on the familiar andi dearly beloved handwriting . He was safe ! He had not perished in the snows ! If she had yielded to her own weakness , if she had given in to the= ' persuasiveness of Lieutenant Beale , she would have passed this mail sack on the trail to Gorgona , she would not have known that her husband was alive until she had reached New York . To Consecrate a Hearth 225She stretched out on the lounge and buried her face in the damask , nable to think or read , knowing only overwhelming relief at his safety . after some time she picked up the letter again . There were ten tightly packed pages of handwriting , for John had put them into journal form , making his letter to her serve as a record of the harrowing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read on : eleven men had perished out of the thirty-three , died of cold and hunger and insanity on the trail ; those who had been saved had emerged as emaciated shadows , half out of their minds with grief and suffering . Everyone in the party was blaming , criticizing and hating everyone else ; John blamed Williams for the tragedy ; Williams blamed John for interference , for guiding the party into hopeless tracks . John was blamed for ordering the men to try to save the baggage instead of themselves , an act which had cost perhaps nine lives ; Williams was accused of cannibalism while on his way out with the relief party . Both men were blamed for not having gone back to save the balance of the party after they had made their way out . John 's own life had been saved only by meeting the son of an Indian chief with whom he had been friends years before . He had reached Kit Carson 's home unable to drag his leg behind him , a scarecrow , sick in body and despairing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ended the letter on a cheerful note , saying that he did not consider the expedition a failure , for he had learned much about that mountainous region , was convinced that a railroadpass could be found close by , and that he would one day find it wider more favorable circumstances . When I think of you , I feel a warm glow at my heart , which renovates It like a good medicine , and I forget painful feelings in strong hope for he future . We shall yet , dearest wife , enjoy quiet and happiness together - these are nearly one and the same to me now . I make frequently pleasantpictures of the happy home we are to have , and o f tenest and among he pleasantest of all I see our library with its bright fire in the rainy ' army days , and the large windows looking out upon the sea in the bright eather . I have it all planned in my own mind . She had been right , she thought exultantly . She had kept her pledge Id they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had written this letter while in bed , unable to move bout ; there was no way for him to get to California except on foot or orseback , and he could not risk the hazardous journey until he was tong again . How long might that be ? Perhaps months . Perhaps never ! u : had known frontiersmen whose legs had been frozen , and who had t them . If John 's leg did not heal he would need medical care ; if it could not be provided in Taos , Kit Carson would have to take him bac to St. Louis for hospitalization . Yes , she would meet her husband in Sa Francisco ; but when ? She opened the letter from her father ; in it he told her the bad ne of the expedition , including an article he had written for the easte papers . He told her how ill her husband was in Taos , how badly his 1 . and side had been affected . He was altogether certain there would he n way for John to make the crossing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his daughter that he was sending dispatch . to Taos urging John to return to St. Louis as fast as his health woul. permit ; and he now urged his daughter with equal vehemence to retu to New York , whence she could go to St. Louis to join her husband . Jessie put aside the letter and stared at the high ceiling of Mada Arce 's bedroom ; yes , her father would urge John to return to St. Lou ' just as Lieutenant Beale had urged her to return to New York . Sick she was , she had refused to turn back ; sick as he might be , John woul. refuse to turn back . A sailor from the S.S. Panama knocked at Madame Arce 's door to i form them that the captain wanted Mrs. Fremont and her daughter come aboard . Two Indian boys carried her luggage to the waterfron She was rowed in a small boat to the ship and then hauled up to the de in a wooden tub suspended by ropes at the end of a boom . Capt Schenck welcomed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving Jessie at Chagres , and had now come around the Cape wi another shipload of voyagers for California . As she gazed at the hu dreds of Americans ' crowded into every spare inch , she asked , " Whe will all of us stay ? " " I do n't know , Madame Fremont , " replied the captain , with a wistf smile . " But we dare not refuse anyone as long as there is standing room . Within a few hours both the S.S. Panama and the S.S. California s sail for San Francisco . Jessie 's ship , which had cabin accommodatio for eighty passengers , carried four hundred men . There was no cabi available , but Captain Schenck put two iron cots under the spank .. boom , covering the space with a large American flag . Everyone was , happy to be en route to San Francisco that no one complained , theatri cals were performed on deck , Jessie and the passengers exchanged th4 few books in their possession , reading aloud in the clear sunshine off the coast of Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief among them Mrs. Matilda Gray , a youngish but matronly soul who was going out to San Francisco to join her husband ; and Mrs. William Gwin , one of Louisiana 's most famous hostesses . Her husband wailp227illiam McK . Gwin , with a leonine head topping his superb six-foot-twotire , the voice of the professional orator , the carriage of the politician. 1 , win 's father had fought with Tom Benton in the War of 1812 and the ! . nilies had been acquainted ever since ; Gwin had no hesitancy in speakingfrankly to Jessie . He had a great deal of political experience , havinghi en a congressman from Mississippi . " I left the most lucrative political job in the United States to migrate n California , " he said . " Within a year I 'll be back in Washington as the First senator from the new state . " Jessie felt a sense of amused shock , as though someone had read her noughts aloud in public meeting . " You seem quite certain of that , Mr. Gwin . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Before I left Washington I ti ) Id Stephen A. Douglas that by this time next year I would ask him to resent my credentials to the Senate . Douglas exclaimed , God bless you , I believe you will . ' " To herself Jessie said , I can believe that , too ; but there are only two kenators from a state ; how many men are headed for California with that identical ambition in mind ? When the ship reached San Diego she put Lily in the care of Mrs. Gray and locked herself in the other woman 's cabin , fearful of the news that was coming , unwilling to be seen when she received it . Above theOise and shouts of the passengers who were disembarking at San Diego the heard the sound of running feet , then someone pounded on her door nd a man cried , " Mrs. Fremont , the colonel 's safe ; he 's riding up toin Francisco to meet you ! He did n't lose his leg , only a bad frostbite . " Jessie unlocked the door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she cried . " Yes , ma'am ! He was here only a few days ago . " The last two days at sea passed swiftly in the anticipation of being reunitedwith her husband . On the morning of June 4 the S.S. Panama lwung eastward toward shore . As she moved through the Golden Gate t , t rait into the bay , with the sandy beaches of San Francisco to the south and the rocky promontories and little islands to the north , Jessie had the uupression that this channel in the curvilineal coast of California was not a strait at all , but rather a canal leading into the fertile womb of the bay , ith the ship carrying the seeds of men , machinery , tools and ideas to give birth to a new civilization . Anchored in the bay were a number of ships , their wooden masts standtugup bare as winter orchards , several of them abandoned . She could ' c a small level square flying the flag of the California Republic , and round the sides a few wooden buildings . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and miners ' tents dotting the hills which rose immediately back of the square . The S.S. Panama fired a salvo of guns to inform San Francisco that she had arrived . A heavy anchor was dropped , and Jessie watched a number of small boats being rowed out to meet them . Once again she and Lily climbed down the side of a rope ladder and were rowed to shore . Since there was no place for the small boats to dock , the sailors had to carry them over the surf . There were hundreds of men on the beach , many of them shouting words of welcome . The cold and the fog set Jessie coughing again . She was glad this was the end of the voyage : she would need the comforts of her own home and the protection of her husband to nurse her back to vigor after the grueling months . But as she stood uncertainly at the edge of the surf and then walked up among the red-shirted , bearded men , she caught no sight of John . Once again her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was here alone . Perhaps he had not reached California at all , and the reports in San Diego had been merely encouragement by kindhearted men . As she stood on the edge of Portsmouth Square holding Lily by one hand , Mrs. Gray came to her side . " Never you mind , dearie , " she said , " the colonel 's been delayed a day or two . This is my husband ; Harry , meet Mrs. Fremont . Let us take you to the Parker House . " Appreciating the kindness , Jessie let Mr. and Mrs. Gray lead her to a hotel room at the Parker House and light a fire in the grate . The Grays took Lily for a walk to see the little mining village while Jessie slept soundly , awakening after dark to the clamor of men 's voices . By looking out the window she saw that she was next door to the Eldorado gambling hall and that a brawl was apparently in process . She lay down on the bed again , but a few minutes later Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For five days she remained in bed , the cough she had contracted in Panama growing increasingly worse . From the conversation outside her window and from the information vouchsafed by her few visitors , she learned that San Francisco was almost deserted , that everyone had spent whatever money he had for supplies and miners ' tools and rushed to the gold fields . Aside from the small amount of trade and the gambling casinos where the men spent the night in order to keep warm , there was no life in San Francisco . As a community it had hardly been born . She thought how greatly her father would have enjoyed this rawness , and was shamed that she could not be more wholeheartedly her father 's daughter . She had grown thin again , her King George 's Mark throbbed un-P229casingly . There were several men in town who knew Colonel Fremont I tom Washington or his expeditions , and they made sure she had sufpiicntfood and firewood for the grate . They kept assuring her that her husband would arrive any hour , but with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from San Diego was a long and hard one by horseback , and the weather had been bad , if John had been there he would have had plenty of time to reach San Francisco by now . ' There were days of heavy rains , converting the earthen surface of Portsmouth Square into a muddy bog . The nights were bitterly cold , for a penetrating wind came over the bay , seeping through the walls and the ill-fitted windows of the hastily constructed hotel . The brushwood fagots smoked , making her eyes smart , and she and Lily lay huddled in the nartowiron bed , comforting each other with hopeful words and bodily warmth . This cold , bare shacklike room was her first home and her first hearth in California . She wondered if her grandmother Benton had lived thus with her children when she had first reached Tennessee ; she wondered if her grandmother had suffered the despair that was gnawmgat her own heart . If only she could be sleeping on the hard cold around of the Santa Cruz ranch , for that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campfire would be a truer hearth than this acridly smoking grate which choked their lungs even while it warmed their flesh . At dusk of the tenth day as she was sitting before the fire , her thin hands clasped in her lap , she heard men 's voices outside her window . someone cried , " Your wife 's inside the house , Colonel . " She moved out of the chair to open the door . Before she could do so , it was flung open And John had taken her in his arms and was crushing her against him . Neither could speak . He led her back to her chair , threw some fresh fagots on the fire , then sat on the floor by her side holding her two hands i t t his , gazing up at her . " You have been ill ; you are ill now , my darling . " " No . . . " The door opened and Lily entered . John embraced his daughter , then took her on his knee . Lily said , sober-faced : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady downstairs says she will die . " He rose before Jessie , put his arms about her waist and gazed into her face . His eyes were dark , self-accusing . She ran her fingers lightly through his long gray hair , then laid her cheek on his . " In her innocence , Lily is partly right . Being away from you is a kind of a death . Only with you am I fully alive and well . "   THE NEXT MORNING she propped a small mirror against a straightbackedchair and sat before it combing out her hair and massaging her face , interested in her appearance for the first time in months . John brought a breakfast of hot coffee and bread up to the room , then left for the office of the American consul to pick up the deed to the Santa Cruz 1 ranch which had been deposited there by Consul Larkin of Monterey . Several hours passed before she heard his footsteps in the hall ; her quick ear perceived that something was wrong : this was not the fast springy step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; this was the plodding step of a man who had suffered a blow . She seized this last instant to tie a blue ribbon about her hair with a small bow on top and to cast a quick look at her blue quilted robe in the pocket mirror . She forced 1 a smile to her face . " John , what has happened ? " He did not answer for a moment , then said : " Larkin did n't get our ranch . " She waited for him to continue , but when he did not , she demanded , " Did n't buy . . . ? But he 's had a full year . " " He bought all right , " John moaned , " but not the magnificent ranch with the beautiful vines and orchards that I told him to acquire ; he used our three thousand dollars to buy a wild tract of land somewhere up in the mountains called the Mariposa . " He took an official-looking document y from his inside coat pocket and flung it angrily on the bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred miles from here , a hundred miles from the ocean or the nearest settlement , high up in the Sierras , impossible to farm , overrun with Indians , so we could n't even set up a cattle ranch . . . " She picked up the document from the bed , opened it and gazed unseeingat the title grant . " But what does it mean ? " she asked . " You did n't tell Larkin to buy the Mariposa . You told him to buy the Santa Cruz ranch . Is it possible that he confused your orders ? " " No , no ! When I handed him the three thousand dollars I gave him written instructions . He had been over the land with me . There was no possibility of an error . " He jumped up from his chair , striding about the cramped little room . " I 'll have to borrow a horse and ride down to Monterey . " " Is the Santa Cruz ranch still available ? " asked Jessie . " Has no one else bought it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land has been sold . He has heard . . . Jessie , it 's just coming to me . Larkin must have bought that land for himself ! " " But if that 's the case , John , we can sue him ; we can recover , it 's a f 1 audulent transaction . " " How ? This is not the United States . This is the Republic of California . They have no courts , no legal system , no judges , no police . It 's the law of t he frontier . Every man for himself . . . " Shrewdly she asked , " Who was the previous owner of the Mariposa ? I ) id Larkin own it , or did he buy it from someone else ? " John took the deed from her hand , glanced at it and replied , " Accordingto this paper , Larkin bought the Mariposa from former governor Alvarado of California , who had been given it in a grant from Spain . It 's it vast tract of mountains and valleys , freezing cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good is a lot of land if it 's valueless ? " She put her fingers lightly on his shoulder . " I shall loathe being left here alone again , but there can be no doubt that you must see Larkin . We want either our land or our three thousand dollars ! " It had always been their intention that John should play a role in making California a state . But how could he do this if he suddenly were ( t ( prived of his property , if he were without a means of livelihood or position to buttress him ? She did not want him to be known as a former explorer ; that would be doubly unfortunate since the failure of his fourth expedition . In order to play a full-voiced part in the forming of the state , toy be elected senator , he must be important in California while the state IA as being founded . But what was this job to be ? Even now the delegates ( if the Constitutional Convention were being elected ; William Gwin had t I sown his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . John would hive to move fast if he wanted to be sent to Monterey as a delegate . She was awakened one night by a clangor in front of the hotel and saw that the sky outside her window was vividly red . The warehouse on the  --  aterfront , where her trunks and heavy boxes were stored , was in flames . f i burned all night ; all night she sat by the window in her robe watching the last of her possessions go up in smoke : her clothing , her linens , 1 , I:Inkets , books , silver , ornaments , beautiful and familiar things she had Drought to make herself a home in California . First they had lost thetita Cruz ranch , and now her only possessions were those in her smalliteases in the hotel room . Fortunately she had her money box with her ; tlI ( se gold coins were her last link to family and security . When they were gone , they would really be pioneers , starting from scratch like everyone around them .   John returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview with Larkin . " There 's something strange about the entire transaction , " he said with a baffled expression . " Thomas Larkin was always straightforward and honest , a shrewd Yankee trader , but one to be trusted . Now his answers are evasive . " " But does he admit he took the three thousand dollars ? Does ha acknowledge that you instructed him to buy the Santa Cruz ranch ? " " Yes , he acknowledges all that , but he has a hundred strange reasons for what he did ; reports came to him that the Santa Cruz soil was n't good ; he did n't think I wanted to be a farmer ; he had a chance to buy the Mariposa from Alvarado and thought I would prefer to live in the mountains , since I loved them so much ; he thought I would rather be a " cattle rancher ; he felt that he had the right to use his own judgment in my best interests . " " How much does he say he paid for the Mariposa ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell him we want either our land or our money ? " " Yes . He said it was impossible , that I had appointed him as my agent , with discretionary powers , and I had to accept the results of his judgment . He was sorry if I was disappointed , but . . . They sat in silence in the mean little room , the future staring them down . She knew that John was grieving mostly over the loss of the beautifulranch and his opportunity to earn a living as a farmer . For her the blow was of a different and more subtle nature : she had been deprived of her opportunity to create a home . Perhaps the gods were not only slow to consecrate a new hearth , but actually reluctant to see one laid . If Consul Larkin had bought any piece of land other than the Mariposa , even though it might have been inferior to the Santa Cruz ranch , she would not have felt so bad , for they still would have had their chance to make a home place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overrun by hostile Indians ; it would be impossible for them to settle there . What were they to do next ? John was not the kind to grasp a pick andbasin and rush to the gold fields ; nor , was there any business he couldenter into in San Francisco . Perhaps in time he might receive a governmentappointment , but that was months off . She had brought with herone thousand dollars in gold loaned to her by her father to buy lumberand farm equipment , but her husband had borrowed twice that sum inTaos in order to bring the remnants of his party through to California . " What do you think we ought to do ? " she asked , curled up crosswaysp233on the bed . He too curled himself across the bed , running his fingers gently over her sunken cheeks . " I 'm sorry you got the starved-cat wife again , John . " " I 'll confess I was hoping to find the bumpy one . " " Be patient , my dear . " " You asked what we should do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cure that cold of yours and get some weight back on you . I 'm going to show you the beauties of California : all you 've seen so far is this mudhole , but clown on the peninsula there are bright sunshine and rolling hills and lovely valleys . I 'm going to take you where it 's warm and the countryside is beautiful . When we have had a month 's vacation , we will face the future . " She snuggled closer into his arms , murmured , " Thank you , darling . But should n't you spend that month campaigning ? The elected delegates are to meet in Monterey in September to adopt a constitution . " He had a way of welding firmness with tenderness . " My first task is to nurse you back to health . You are more important to me than politics . Resides , I 'm not . . . I 'm not a campaigner . Most of the people in the state know me , or know of me . There 's little I could say from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind went back to the spring evening in the summerhouse on C Street when Tom Benton had perceived that his daughter was in love with Lieutenant Fremont . John had said , " I am not much interested in politics . " " But surely you want to participate in the Constitutional Convention ? " " Not as a delegate . As a friend and adviser of the delegates , as an influence behind the scenes . I think I can do more good that way . " She did not see how , but she thought it wiser not to press the point . Instead she closed her eyes to embrace the vision of a month of leisure in warmth and beauty , with her husband at her side . Gregorio , an Indian boy who had stuck with John through the worst rigors of the cold and starvation and had accompanied him from Taos , joined them on their trip down the peninsula . Also old Knight , who had been with John on an earlier expedition and was one of the sharpest frontiersmen of the West . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the Parker House in an hour . Jessie dressed in her black silk , with the silk bonnet that matched . She did not think it a proper costume inhich to go camping , but it was the only one she had left . After an hour : he and Lily went down to the entrance of the Parker House . Within a few moments her husband came driving across Portsmouth Square in a . ix-seated surrey , the first she had seen in California . John whoaed the horses , jumped out and helped his wife into the new and luxurious interior , with its upholstered cushions of Spanish leather , compartments for storage of suitcases and foodstuffs . " Where ever did you find this in San Francisco ? " she asked in awe , caressing the beautiful upholstery . " I had it made for you in New Jersey before I left . It 's been standing here in a storehouse for two months . It 's guaranteed to ride as smooth as a boat , and look , it has reversible seats that make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you would at home . Lily will have plenty of space in this large boot to stretch out . " " Oh , darling , " she murmured , " this is the first piece of good luck we 've had in California . " " There 's another piece of good luck waiting around the corner , afraid to come to you , but I have convinced him that all is forgiven . " Jessie saw Lieutenant Beale come striding toward her with a sheepish grin on his long face . He said , " Madame Fremont , I am a fool ! I do not deserve your forgiveness ! If you had followed my wretched advice you would now be in the East while your husband would be here . When I think how hard I tried to persuade you . . . " " These are things that only women understand , Lieutenant , " she repliedgaily . " There 's nothing to forgive ; I was touched by your concern for me in Panama . " " Then may we take him along on our junket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent pot-au-feu when he does n't throw too much pepper into it ; and he 's the one who begged , borrowed or stole these beautiful white horses . " They followed the trail down the peninsula , leaving behind the fog and cold of San Francisco , and within a couple of hours had emerged into warm clear sunlight , with the ripe fields of oats moving gently on the hillsides , and the wild cattle grazing under the trees . The countryside was like a park with mile after mile of beautiful grasses , wild flowers and magnificent trees . When the air grew a little cool , John threw his faded blue army cape over her shoulders . They made camp in midafternoon by the side of a brook . While Jessie refreshed herself and Lily in the cold water the men rode off in search of a neighboring ranch house , returning with half a sheep and some fresh corn which they barbecued over live coals of the fire . The Morocco carriage cushions were piled in front of the fire for Jessie and Lily , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John had brought along claret and tea and a box of French bonbons for Lily . Under the deepening 1 cloudless sky the air was soft and warm . Supper was finished by dusk . Fresh logs were put on the fire , the men began telling stories of otherTo Consecrate a Hearth 235camps on the frontiers of South America , the Orient , and this wide American continent . Gregorio told of his childhood with the Indian tribe . Beale told sea stories and little jokes to make Jessie laugh . Old Knight , tall and gnarled as a mountain pine , ageless , with a long white beard which seemed somehow transplanted from his bald and shiny head , spun yarns of the days when the frontier had been only a hundred miles west of Washington . As the night skies deepened , the campfire lighted the trees and brook , then the stars came out and to Jessie it was a scene of great beauty . This is my first hearth , she said to herself , just the kind we should have in a new country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine o'clock she and Lily were comfortably settled in the carriage . The men had tied their hammocks to the trees and fallen asleep . Jessie listened to the crackling of the logs on the fire , the mules munching their wild oats , the half-muted cry of a coyote who had not the courage to dome in and steal her supper . At dawn John awakened her with a cup of hot tea , then made a dressing tent for her by the side of the brook from a pair of blankets . She took her tin basin , towels , French soap and cologne to the running water , scrubbed Lily and then gave herself a leisurely bath . A doctor might have told her that bathing in a cold stream at dawn was dangerous ; they had told that to her father forty years before . By the time she had dressed and returned to the campfire the carriage was ready , with most of the gear packed . After a cup of tea and a couple of old Knight 's hot muffins , she said to John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " To eat with all the appetite you can gather , to be happy . " " That 's all , no work ? " " No work , " replied the men . " This is your holiday . Women are useless on the trail , anyway . " The sun was bright and warm when they started toward San Jose . There were n't any roads , but the sturdily built carriage could go anywhere that wheels could go , and so they drove through the dry fertile valleys , climbed up the hills to overlook the ocean , followed bridle paths among the pines ever southward into warmer country , the men holding back the carriage with their riatas on steep grades . Knight and Gregorio would walk ahead of the two pack mules , which carried leather panniers loaded with clothing , cans and bottles of food , hammocks , pots and pans . John and Beale took turns driving the horses . At noon they stopped for luncheon and a siesta , throwing into the pot-au-feu large Spanish onions , sweet red peppers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoured the countryside for eggs and fruits . When Jessie awakened from her nap they would drive on until time to make camp . For the first week her cough persisted ; she began taking sun baths during the nor 1 halt and by the end of the second week the pain in her chest was easi , And so she moved through the balmy days , having no interest in time , regaining her joyousness with each passing hour . Sometimes in an inlanc : valley behind the coast range the sun was burning hot , sometimes the air from the sea was soft and cool . When they put into a village they had their linens washed by the Indian women ; sometimes they stopped at the ranches of the Californios where Jessie had proof that General Kearny 's charges against her husband of maltreating the natives had been false . The Californios welcomed the party , staged fiestas in their honor , while Jessie and the women talked of clothes and babies . They had the good fortune to participate in a three-day wedding celebration , riding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and the short velvet jackets and colorful velvet trousers of the men . Jessie 's carriage was a matter of great interest to the Californios , who had nothing but solid wooden wheel carts pulled by oxen . On the last night of July , while they were camped in the Santa Cruz mountains overlooking the sea , not far from the ranch which was supposedto have been their home , a sudden gust of rain swept across the ridge . John said , " I think your vacation is over , madame . We must decide now where we are going to settle down . " Jessie sighed reluctantly . " This has been a wonderful month . But I 'm ready to set up our home . Where shall it be ? How far are we from the Mariposa ? " " About two hundred miles , I should guess . " " Would it be difficult for us to see the land ? I 'm curious about it . " " It 's a long journey on horseback across mountain trails and unbridged streams . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in . " His eyes lighted as he thought of the journey . " We 'd go up the San Joaquin Valley , then straight into the Sierras . " " Would we pass the gold fields ? " " Yes , we 'd go straight through the gold country . " They looked at each other , an expression of incredulity coming over their faces . " By the Eternal , Jessie , " whispered John , " I never thought of it before . 1 We own the largest tract of mountain country in California . Men are washing out fortunes in gold dust only a hundred miles away . . . " Her eyes wide with wonderment , she whispered too , " Darling , is it possible ? Could there be gold on the Mariposa ? " He sprang to his feet . " It 's the same mountain range ; it would haveTo Consecrate a Hearth 237the same roc ormations , the same mineral deposits . It would have the , ame kind of . shing mountain streams to carry the gold dust down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " Could we start for San Francisco tomorrow morning ? Could we buy picks and shovels and join the gold rush ? " " It 's a risk , you know , " said John . " Once we occupy the Mariposa , even to hunt gold on it , we will be making a legal acceptance of the land . We can never get our three thousand dollars from Larkin . " " We have no way of getting it back , anyway . " " How much cash do we have left out of your father 's thousand dollars ? " " About five hundred . " " Then why do n't we plunge the rest of our resources in a real gamble ? " " How do you mean ? " " While I was coming out from Taos I encountered a party of Sonorans from Mexico , en route to the gold fields . I rode with them for several days . When I was in Monterey I met them again ; they were exhausted from the long march and planned to rest before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deal with them : if I outfit them with food and tools and offer them half of all the gold they find on the Mariposa , they 'll bring us down a fortune  --  if there is a fortune to be brought down . If there 's no gold in the Mariposa , we will be broke . " " I 'm not scared , John . Besides , I think it is futile to arrive in California ; it the height of the greatest gold strike the world has ever known and not take part in it . I 'd like to wade up a mountain stream myself with a dishpanin my hands and see if I could n't collect some gold dust . . . " Exhilarated , he chuckled , " That 's the mercenary streak in you , Jessie ; t me be the luster after wealth in this family , it does n't become you . I 'll ' , Ike the Sonorans up to the Mariposa . When we return you will be a rich man 's lady . " " Just so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she retorted . The NEXT AFTERNOON they reached the plateau above Monterey , with the little village nestling in the pines beneath them , and still farther down , t he rocky shore of the crescent-curved bay . Jessie stood among the pines , Nv aching the gulls flash white across the sun ; she said to her husband , Why could n't we make our permanent camp here within sight and ) und of all this beauty ? It is warmer and quieter than San Francisco . " " Yes , I think you would be happy in Monterey . I will go into town to , ec if I can find us a house . "   He was gone only an hour when she saw him swinging up the little trail from the village . " There are no houses available , " he announced , " but I 've found two lovely rooms in the house of the wife of the Mexican general Castro , who was exiled to Mexico City after our conquest . She does not hold this against us . We will be comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove it down the winding path to the village . Madame Castro 's house was the former Mexican governor 's home : a huge ballroom fronted the bay , two adobe wings ran back from the water to meet a garden enclosed in soft-colored adobe walls ; the roof was of rough red tile , the floors of smooth red tile , and there were hedges of pinks lining the garden walls and walks . The ballroom was now rented as a warehouse for a flour merchant ; Jessie was ushered into one of the wings which contained two rooms , high-ceilinged , the adobe walls whitewashed . They were innocent of furniture except for a wood stove in a small anteroom . Jessie presented her compliments to Madame Castro , who loaned them two cots and two chairs , several pots and pans , a few dishes and some flatware . Leaving her to survey her new home , and to wonder how she was going to get it furnished , John went out to find his Sonorans , returning at lunchtime . " The Mexicans have agreed to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must leave for San Francisco with them at once . " At her crestfallen expression , he added quickly , " I will be back in a couple of weeks , just as soon as there is news . " " Very well , " said Jessie , " but since you are going up to San Francisco , you must use part of our funds to buy furniture and linens and dishes and silverware . This is the first time I shall be a housewife , and I am afraid I ca n't do very well with a few borrowed dishes . Let me give you a list ; and you had better buy materials so that I can make some clothes for Lily and myself . Our two outfits are threadbare . " He left by midafternoon , assuring her that the first ship to reach Montereywould carry everything needed to make them happy at Madame Castro 's . Jessie was delighted when Gregorio asked permission to remain behind as houseboy . She set about her duties as housewife , but the gold seekers had swept the country clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat , vegetables , fruits , canned goods and the wheat and grain staples . She could find little to buy but rice and beans , a little flour and sugar . She had never cooked anything more than a pot of coffee , and now she was thrust into the position of feeding herself , Lily and Gregorio on a few crude staples . Occasionally when she came back from a brisk walk in the hills with Lily she would find Gregorio squatting before the fire , a broadP239red sash around his waist and a red silk handkerchief tied around his jetblackhair , cooking a guisado , a compound of birds , squirrel , dried red peppers and rice stewed together . Gregorio liked to picture himself in the role of houseboy , as he had been for the Mission Fathers , but he had preconceived notions of what a man might and might not do : he would light the fire in the open hearth in the living room , but a man did not chop wood , that was a squaw 's work , so Jessie chopped her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not cook over a stove , that was squaw 's work , and so Jessie did the cooking . " It 's a good thing Gregorio is ornamental , " she laughed to Lily , " with that red band around his straight Indian hair , because he really is n't useful . You and I do more cooking for him than he does for us . " " When he shoots a partridge or quail , " answered Lily , " he cooks it over the open fire and brings it to us on a stick . " " Yes , " agreed Jessie with a wry smile , " whether it 's three in the afternoonor three in the morning ! We have to eat it whether we 're hungry or not , so that we wo n't offend him . I wonder if I 'll ever be able to teach him the quaint American custom of cooking and serving food at meal-times ? " " I do n't think so , " replied Lily , straight-faced . " You see , Mother , the Indians never had clocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They ate when they got hungry , or they had shot something . " At the end of two weeks a ship arrived from San Francisco , and a numberof sailors began bringing crates up to the Castro house . When everything had been assembled Jessie found that her husband had sent her two high , roomy New England bedsteads , plenty of sheets and blankets , woven East Indian wicker chairs , a beautiful inlaid teakwood table , enough Chinese matting to cover the tile floors , white lace material for curtains , Chinese satins and French damasks for draperies , two exquisitely shaped English pottery punch bowls to be used as washbasins , colorful French and Chinese satin-cushioned bamboo couches and chairs ; two big grizzly-bear skins to be thrown over the matted floor in front of the fireplace ; tin candlesticks and tall white spermaceti candles under whose light she and her father had worked for so many hours in their library in Washington . Wrapped as though it were the prize of the shipment , she found a copy of Lane 's translation of The Arabian Nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Madame Castro , and with Gregorio doing the heavy work , Jessie tacked the lovely white curtains over the windows , spread the matting on the floor , set out the beds in the rear room and the teakwoodtable with the wicker chair in the living room . When the place began to look warm and homelike , she had Gregorio bring in the last big iI package and open it in front of the fire . For a moment she believed she was dreaming , for someone had sold to her husband as " very durable for a lady 's winter clothes " harsh merinos , thick muslins and cotton-back satins in loud and garish patterns . After her first shock , she had to laugh . " It serves me right , " she said to Lily , " for letting a man buy cloth for women 's clothes ; but never mind , we 'll make the best of it . Here we go for a winter wardrobe . " She carefully ripped up her one remaining set of cambric underclothes to use as a pattern , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Washington wardrobe . She did the same for Lily , laying out the patterns on the living-room floor as a guide , attempting to copy their lines in these new and strangely intractable stuffs . She pinned , measured , and remeasured herself and Lily before daring to put scissors to cloth . She had grown so thin since the black silk dress had been made that the first fitting showed the need for drastic alterations . She told her daughter the story of the old lady in St. Louis who never shaped stockings , but knitted them straight to the heel , saying , " It 's a mighty poor leg that ca n't shape its own stocking . " She built Lily 's wardrobe and her own on this plan , playinga game in which she became Mrs. Abbott of London , fashionable mantua maker , and Lily her wealthy and imperious client , having elegant gowns built for Washington society . The game had added piquancy , for John had taken nearly all their money to San Francisco to outfit the Sonorans , and Jessie was getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnishings , she surmised with a crooked smile as she gazed about her , had been bought on credit . With her husband away , Lily became her companion . She took her : daughter for long walks among the pine-covered hills overlooking the bay , spent several hours each day teaching her arithmetic , geography and his-tory , gave the seven-year-old a feeling of participation in their communal life by letting her do her share of the housework . Although these separationsfrom her husband gave her the opportunity to devote herself to her daughter , they also brought Jessie closest to Lily during those periods when the light was gone from her eye and the sparkle from her brain and spirit . Lily was an observant child , she commented on what a different person her mother was when Father was present , how much more gay she was then , her step and her words fast and strong . Jessie felt consciencestrickenand redoubled her efforts to make Lily feel her love , but the light , the inner warmth and glow went out when John left , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman , wishing away her days until her husband would return . She was perplexed by Lily 's unfolding nature ; by some strange twistP241of fate she found her daughter unimaginative in everything except this offering of her mother 's while her father was away . While she knew that the child must resent her father 's dominating her mother 's love and in-t crest , yet when loneliness overcame her , it was Lily who served as coin- ! ) rter , stroking her hair the way John did , speaking her father 's words of endearment exactly in her father 's tone . She could discover no way in which Lily was like herself or John . She was a great deal like her aunt i ; liza : biggish and awkward in figure , with plain features , literal-minded , practical in a way that neither Jessie nor John could ever be . Jessie had once remarked to her husband that Lily was a demon for the unvarnished t ruth ; the daughter frequently punctured the romantic imaginings of her parents . There were occasions when Jessie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for romantics , and a practical nature at the family board could be a blessing . Late one afternoon , about a month after John had left for San Fran- ( isco , while she was sewing before the hearth in the living room , with Gregorio and Lily squatting on their haunches before the fire toasting quail , the door was thrown open and John burst into the room , his face end clothing soiled from the long ride , but a fiery glow in his eyes . He was et her side before she could rise , had laid a heavy sack at her feet . She did lot open it but only gazed up at him . He quickly untied the thongs about he neck of the sack , scooped his right hand into it and with his left hand rasping her wrist tightly , poured a slow , bright stream of powder into ea- palm . " Gold ! " she cried . " Yes , my darling , gold . Do you know how much gold is in this sack ? One hundred pounds ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side and ran to the door , crying over his shoulder , " Wait there , do n't move . " In a moment he returned with another heavy sack in each hand , the weight far more than he could ordinarily have borne . He I topped the two sacks in front of her on the hearth , untied the thongs and t pilled out a handful of gold from each . " Every creek is lined with gold . The Sonorans washed out seventy-five t housand dollars ' worth in three weeks ! " This turn of events was more than Jessie could comprehend . She had been reduced to her last few dollars for provisions , and now suddenly she had hundred-pound sacks of gold dust dumped at her feet . When she at last found her tongue , all she could stutter , unbelievingly , was : " It 's . . . all . . . ours ? " " No , only half is ours ; you remember , I promised the Sonorans half the gold they found . But there are millions of dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anything yet found in California . But that 's not the most important part : I think the Mother Lode runs through our Mari-posa ! " " Mother Lode ? " she repeated meaninglessly , still too stunned to think . " Yes . While crossing our land I saw geological formations that I thought gave promise of containing precious minerals . Then I found a large piece of gold-bearing quartz . Do you know what that means , Jessie ? All the gold that we wash out of the rivers comes originally from the goldquartzrock formations . A thousand men swarming over the streams of the Mariposa could wash out all the gold that the water has carried down for centuries ; that supply can be exhausted within a few months . But if we have the original source , the deep layers of gold quartz that might run across a whole mountain range , then literally there are millions of dollars in the Mariposa ! " She did n't know whether to laugh or cry ; there certainly was no disputingthese three heavy sacks of gold , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Money had never been important in her life , but that was because she had never wanted for it . Having arrived in a strange country , only to find themselves dispossessed of their ranch , several thousand dollars in debt , and with no means of earning a livelihood , she felt this discovery to be providential . This gold through which she ran her fingers in the open mouths of the sacks was to her more a symbol of happiness than of wealth , for she knew how much it could mean to her husband : in success , in accomplishment , while at the height of his powers and in the midst of overwhelming praise , John was modest , reserved , unassuming , warmhearted , generous , lovable . He was built to withstand success ; the greater the success , the finer John Fremont shone forth . But he was not equipped to withstand failure or defeat ; these brought out the very worst in him . They made him suspicious , vindictive , intolerant , mean-spirited and small-souled . That was why she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collapse and destruction of the fourth expedition ; that was why the loss of the Santa Cruz ranch , even though she had never thought that he should be a farmer , had been such a serious blow : she had feared it might turn her husband bitter , start him thinking in terms of conspiracy and persecution . But now he would be rich . This was a kind of success everyone could understand and no one could dispute . Even more important than being rich , he would have become the darling of the gods : for he had discoveredgold on his own land , not merely the gold that had been washed down by the streams , but the very source of that gold . She knew that when word of this discovery reached the East it would wipe out the criticism of his failure to find a new railroad pass , his failure to keep hisP243party alive and return them all to safety . The news that John Fremont had discovered part of the Mother Lode on his Mariposa estate would sweep the East with as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first three expeditions  --  and it would do as much to intensify the ever Rowing migration to California ! She uttered thanks to God , grateful that her man had once again been set on his feet . THE FOLLOWING MORNING , when he had dashed off for the mines , it I seemed like a fantastic dream ; every once in a while she would have return to the sacks and run her fingers through the shining dust to assure herself that she had not been dreaming . Yet the presence of the Id in the house brought little material change , for there was no addionalfood available , and there were no men left in Monterey to perform iy kind of service ; everyone had rushed to the gold fields , and the Indian omen would do no work . One day a strapping Texan knocked at her oor with a healthy young mulatto girl in tow . " I hear you are in need of a servant , Mrs. Fremont , " he said . " I come sell you this slave girl . I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more . I 'll make a reasonable bargain . " " Would you allow her to work for me for wages ? " " No , ma'am , " replied the Texan , " I want to sell her and get rid of her or good . " " I do n't want to buy her , " replied Jessie firmly . " But why not , ma'am ? I 'm not even naming the price . I can collect m the colonel any time . " " I thank you for your kindness , sir , " she replied , " but you do n't underand . I do n't believe in buying and selling persons . " " Why should you keep yourself from living in comfort ? " asked the cxan . " Everybody buys and sells niggers . " " Colonel Fremont and I do not . We do n't believe in slavery . We have ways had colored people in our home , but they have been freemen , free go when they wished . " And so she continued to scrub her own floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she could wash where they had been standing . In addition to the gracious Spanish women with whom she could spend neighborly hour now and then , she found that the United States Army cers were moving their headquarters to Monterey because living inFrancisco had grown too expensive . Generals James Benton Riley d P. T. Smith were there with their wives , and young William T , Sher- man , with a consumptive cough but an inexhaustible supply of good stories . During August , Monterey became excited and busy , for it was to be the first state capital and within a few weeks the delegates would assemble to organize their government and draw up a constitution . Colton Hall , which the Reverend Samuel Wiley had been using as a school , was turned into a convention hall ; a hotel had been started for the delegates , but since the mechanics had departed for the mines , there were few carpenters to work on it . By the first of September the delegates began to ride into Monterey For the most part they were a rough-hewn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of them Jessie knew from Washington an St. Louis , with most of the others John was acquainted from his forme stays in California . Six-foot-six Robert Semple , who had been importan in forming the Bear Flag Republic , was chosen chairman ; William G Marcy , son of the secretary of war , was appointed secretary ; J. Ro Browne , a traveling journalist , was made shorthand reporter ; W. E. P Hartnell , an Englishman , was engaged as interpreter for the Californios There were early settlers , professional politicians , Englishmen , Irishmen Frenchmen , Spaniards : America in microcosm . Two days before the convention opened the hotel owner abandoned . hopes of getting his building completed , announcing , " The weather wi hold good ; the delegates can roll up in their serapes and sleep under th pine trees . " However , there was not a restaurant in town ; some of th men brought their own food in packs , but others came totally unprepared Hospitality was for Jessie as natural as breathing , and she held open hou every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had becom good at making rice puddings , and the delegates were expert with the ' guns and fishing lines . Few came to dinner without a bird or a fish i hand . She and Gregorio set up a long wooden table in the big garden . He every afternoon ten or fifteen delegates would gather to talk politics an . discuss the coming convention . Of the thirty-six American delegat. twenty-two came from the north and only fourteen from the south ; neve theless , the contest over slavery was sure to be hotly waged . There we three other American women in Monterey , Mrs. Larkin , Mrs. Riley an . Mrs. Smith , all pleasant and hospitable women who did their share i entertaining the delegates ; however , because Jessie and John had alread been friends with some thirty out of the thirty-six delegates , their horn became the informal star chamber of the convention , and here manythe issues were rehearsed . Long experience in the clash of political theori had taught Jessie how to sustain an atmosphere in which these ide ; y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms were small , P245lie furnishings were bizarre and ill-fitted ; the outdoor table was of rough ooden planks ; but her warmth , her delight in participating in the crea-i ' o ti of the new state kept the glow on her cheeks , her eyes sparkling , her 1 , , itgue witty and welcoming . As she looked about the rough board table with its covering of unhItached muslin brier-stitched with red thread , the oddly assorted silver- , re and unmatched Chinese and Mexican dishware ; as she looked at he unshaven , roughly garbed frontiersmen eating the fish which they : lad aught themselves in Monterey Bay , and she had baked over the outdoor , with big bowls of rice pudding in the center of the table to finish off I repast , her mind went back to the highly polished mahogany table in the Benton dining room in Washington , with its shining damask cloths , ' , learning silver and cut-glass bowls of fruits and candies , with Joshaam . ntl Josheem padding about silently , passing the sides of rare roast beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turkey , the beef and kidney pies . Incongruous as were the furnished two rooms at Madame Castro 's house , she developed a genuine love for them . Visited by men who spent most of the year sleeping on the ground or living in improvised shacks , tents or wretched boardinghouses , Jessie 's rooms seemed like a breath of bottle . One Sunday evening when the weather suddenly turned cold , and they were eating indoors , William Gwin , John Sutter , Robert Semple , nd Henry W. Halleck made an inspection of the rooms , and then Sempleid : " Mrs. Fremont , we were saying among ourselves how surprising itas that you could achieve such comfort in a queer place like Monterey . " Jessie looked about her critically , trying to see the rooms with the eyes f a stranger . On the floor were the two grizzly-bear skins , their glass eyes gifted by the fire ; the windows were draped with elegant Chineseocade , the adobe walls were crudely whitewashed , and on the Chinesettan furniture were cushions covered with exquisite French silks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis , while on thetinese teakwood table was the representative of another great religion , bronze Buddha ; alongside were a two-year-old copy of the Londonnch and her Martha Washington sewing basket , the same one in whichc had concealed the letter from Colonel Abert . She took the stance of aofessional lecturer , raised one arm in the air for silence , and announcedher father 's sometime pontifical tone : " Gentlemen , at first glance you might think this room incongruous , but ving made close study of it , I find it true to the period , Pioneer Fortytie , worthy elements from all over the world , guarded by a CaliforniaHer one disappointment was that her husband was not at home to join the hospitality , the discussions , and the formulation of policy . She felt that John should have been a member of this convention , that even now he should be having serious talks with every delegate , helping to set official state policy . But word of the tremendous findings on the Mariposa had spread over central California and already several thousand prospectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant did not give them exclusive mineral rights ; anyone was entitled to wash out and pick up the gold lying in the Mariposa streams . John had felt that at that particular moment he should be with the Sonorans , helping them find th best streams in which to work , taking out their gold nuggets and gold dust before another several thousand prospectors flooded over the land Jessie had not thought it so necessary to get out the last possible bag of gold dust ; they had not come to California to be gold miners or to become rich ; they had come to enter into the local politics ; why then allow th accidental discovery of gold on the Mariposa to upset their plans and t. keep John away from the California Constitutional Convention ? She had suggested all this to her husband , but he had declared that . long he was not a delegate there was no proper place for him ; that mo-d the delegates knew his stand and his politics from years of contact ; tha no one could blame him for making gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their regular quartz mines , their property would be safe an . he would not have to be on the ground . It was unfortunate that the con vention and the Mariposa gold rush were taking place at the sam moment , but he felt he owed it to all of them to get out as much gold . he could and let Jessie be his representative in Monterey as she had bee in Washington . One evening Delegate Lippincott of Philadelphia brought fifteen del .. gates in to dinner . They watched Jessie standing over the stove cooki the food ; they watched her cover the rough planks with the strips of u bleached muslin brier-stitched together ; they watched her serve , wi Gregorio 's help , twenty-four guests ; they saw her sit at the head of t table and with high spirits guide the political discussions so that they eluded everyone about the table ; they saw her gather up the soiled plat. then wash the dishes and silver while William Sherman , the Revere Wiley and Robert Semple stood about drying them , everyone keeping a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had assembl. in the living room , several of the lanky frontiersmen sprawling on the fie , . in front of the fire , one of the delegation said : " Mrs. Fremont , we heard in town that you were offered a young sla girl to do your work and you refused to buy her . Is that true ? " " Quite true , " replied Jessie . " Neither Mr. Fremont nor I believe buying and selling human beings . I would never consent to use or own slave . "  | " Not even if it meant you would have to scrub your own floors and %vh your own dishes for the rest of your life ? " Not even , " said Jessie with a quiet smile . " The women in San Francisco are crying for suv-vents , but if you , a Washington fine lady , can get along without , they sha n't have them . We 'll keep clear of slave labor . " Hallelujah ! thought Jessie . At last that title " fine lady " may accomplish uc une good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California the Italy of America . Is n't it an ideal place for small homes and well-tended acreage ? If we keep slave labor out , we will have the wealthy and comfortable middle class , but no " That 's a fine sentiment , " replied William Steuart , head of the proveryleaders , " but the aristocracy will always have slaves . " " How about you joining the aristocracy of emancipators , Mr. Steurt ? " she shot back . " My father freed all his slaves in St. Louis before he Went to Washington twenty-five years ago . " " But who 's going to do all the hard and dirty labor ? " " You are , " flashed Jessie , " and I am ! I am raising a child in California , and before long you men will be bringing your wives out here or arrying and raising families . It is n't a pretty sight in a free country for hild to see and hear chain gangs clanking through the streets or to atch officers chasing a fugitive slave and putting him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state for ? If so , it would be better if we all turned east and left this beautiful country alone . " On the day before the convention was to open , John rode in from the ariposa , unable to stay away . There was a gala party in the Fremont ) ms that night , with every American in Monterey assembled , even ) nsul Larkin , looking sheepish , but wanting to be friends again . The next morning the convention opened . Jessie and John sat behind ( . rough wooden railing which had been stretched across the middle of c hall . Using the constitutions of New York and Iowa as models , the legates pushed forward rapidly in a series of sharp discussions , debates ich seemed to Jessie to be on a high plane of intelligence and integrity . e rememberd the story her father told her of the Constitutional Conntionof Missouri , which much of the California procedure now durated . William Gwin dominated the convention with his magnificent figure , time head and orator 's voice . He was a sincere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in parliamentary procedure . Jessie saw that delegates not only admired him but had faith in his judgment . As thepassed and Gwin directed more and more of the discussion , she be- came convinced that his boast in Washington would be carried out , that he would be returned by the legislature as one of the first two California senators . That left only one berth open . To whom would it go ? To her husband , sitting quietly beside her , for some reason best known to himself never rising to his feet , never asking for permission to participate , content to exercise his influence at home over the dinner table in quiet an . friendly chats ? After the convention had been in session for a week , and it was eviden that California would become a free state , John could contain himself n. longer . He rode south to buy several big cattle ranches which he ha . admired since he had first seen them during the conquest , then returne. to San Francisco to invest some of his rapidly accumulating gold in trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sent word noto expect him for a considerable time , as the Sonorans wanted to go horn . for Christmas and he thought he ought to stay on the Mariposa as long . possible . Gregorio went up to the mountains to be with him , leaving Jessi and Lily alone . With the last of the delegates gone , Monterey seeme. quiet and lonely . IN OCTOBER slashing rains were whipped against the windows by stron winds off the Pacific . The streets became the same kind of mudholes Jess ' remembered from the early days of Washington , and there could be lit visiting back and forth . One large window overlooked the bay , deserted beach and the rocks beyond . She thought , With the sea one never alone . Yet with the sea , as with everything else , its joys are e hanced a hundredfold when you have a loved one by your side to share ' its rich variety . After supper Lily would get into her nightgown and th .. stretch out on the grizzly rug before the fire , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made ever changing flame pi tures . The days and the nights were long , for she had too little to do , and h library consisted of exactly the one book which John had found in S Francisco while buying furniture . She read one story from The Arabi Nights to Lily each Sunday night , Lily calling it their Sunday dessert , f. she wanted to make the book last as long as possible . Fortunately the flo merchant who had taken over the ballroom at the front of the hou found five bound volumes of the London Times and a number of volurn of the Merchant 's Magazine , which he gave to her . She had not much i terest in commerce , but for want of something better to read she persist . and finally grew interested : for a lover of books is like a lover of womeP249would rather have an interesting book than a dull one , but he would tlicr have a dull one than none at all . Then General Riley stumbled ross a volume of Lord Byron 's poems , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before her fireplace while the winter surf Ktmed across the rocks and the night was filled with cold and rain . Every week or two Gregorio or a trusted Sonoran would arrive with pre sacks of gold dust , which she stored in trunks and boxes under the ds . One day in November , General Riley 's wife was visiting when egorio came in with two of the heavy buckskin sacks . Mrs. Riley , who d been in the Army since she was nineteen , living on low-scale army y , said : " I really must congratulate you on your growing riches . " The well-meant remark , said without any apparent envy , threw Jessie 's eks of loneliness into focus . She did not enjoy being separated from husband for the sake of making money ; they had already been sepatedtoo much and too cruelly . Nor did she enjoy the thought of sitting two rain-swept rooms with nothing to do but feed herself and her lid , while the weeks and the months passed , and she had no part to y , no job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable portion his time on the Mariposa ; he thought it too remote and too dangerous his wife to come there and make their home . What then was she to ? Sit here in Madame Castro 's two rooms while they accumulated moremore wealth ? To what end ? She asked only a few simple things of : the company and love of her husband ; important work to do at his ; sons to bear his name . Turning to Mrs. Riley she murmured : ' Gold is n't much as an end , is it ? It ca n't conjure comforts or an ce of brain rations . I am simply famished for the taste of a good book . give every last one of those buckskin sacks to have my husband here I me now . " s the long months of winter spun themselves out , and John managed get home only for a day or two , Jessie realized that this was almost same as his being out on another expedition . She counted back over memories of her marriage , realizing that more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anxiety and uncertainty over his welfare . ( lid not think that the quantity of money involved should have any iu  --  nce on her feelings ; she could not have felt more keenly a sense of life abeyance if John had been earning single dollars instead of tens of usands. ' ( ) ward the end of November she received in the mail a long envelope ressed to Colonel John C. Fremont , which proved to be a question-r relating to her husband 's political beliefs . The committee that had ' ten the letter wished to assure Colonel Fremont that if he wouldP250answer the questions satisfactorily , they would back him for the Unit . States Senate . She engaged an Indian to ride to the Mariposa and summon John , f . an immediate answer was expected , and both letters would be publish . in the California newspapers . She made a copy of the letter to send wi i the messenger , so that he could be formulating his reply on the long ri  --  home . He arrived at the end of the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three thousand prospectors pouring over the Ma posa ; the Sonorans figured that they had enough money to last the r. of their lives in Mexico and would work no longer ; there was no la  --  available at any price to take their place . Jessie saw that her husba was less than ever interested in politics . She boiled an iron tub of wat over the outside fire in order that he might have a brisk scrub-up , there . they had tea and biscuits . " You see , " she said , " I 'm a better visionary than I am a cook : I p dieted when you left on the second expedition five years ago that y  --  would be one of the first senators from California . " He did not look as pleased at her outburst of confidence as she h hoped . His dark eyes could peer as fiercely inward as they could peer o ward , and she saw that her husband had been undergoing several da of intense soul searching . " If I am elected , Jessie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marip. and our mines ? All the surface gold will be gone very shortly . We 'll ha to buy machinery , bring in a competent labor supply and follow the go quartz into the sides of the mountains . If we do n't start this work v .. soon , others will , and we will lose possession ; under existing law we ha no mineral rights even inside our land unless we set up permanent equi ment to mine it . If I were to be elected and we left for Washington , he do we know when we would get back ? Our dream of wealth will be go others will have pre-empted it . " 1She did not think this a serious problem ; even after they had paid Sonorans their half of the gold dust , there still would be about two h dred thousand dollars in gold for them . This was a great deal of mon it was a lifetime 's money ; why did they need millions , particularly if t. cost of those millions was a seat in the United States Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus to her husband ; it wo seem that she was trying to force her peculiar values on him , as thou she would oblige him to think that because in the Benton family a Unit States senator was the world 's most important dignitary , John Chary Fremont , who had never shown any appetite for the Senate , should up the opportunity to become one of the world 's richest and most powerp251ful men , an opportunity neither remote nor fanciful , but at his very fingertips . " I do n't want to influence you , " she said --  " that is , not too strongly . I 've always dreamed of seeing you in the Senate , but there 's no reason why you should shackle yourself with my ambitions . After all , it is you who will have to do the work , and so you should decide for yourself . If you want to go to the Senate , then we should write the strongest polemic on your political philosophy we can create ; if you would prefer to stay here and start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Washington , and Lily and I will move up to the Mariposa with you and build our home there . You say you will need labor for the mines ; the best way to attract it is to have a going community with comfortable cabins and a More and a school for the children . " " Yes , those are our alternatives . " " Then it 's purely a case of values . Which means the more to you ? " He was silent for a long time , his chin resting on his chest , his eyes staring inward , not seeing the strained and hopeful expression on his wife 's face . " I should like to try to do both , " he finally said ; " I think we can work 4 out . I will stand for the election , and we will leave for Washington immediatelyif I am successful . When our ship arrives in New York , I willuy the mining equipment and send it out here . I will also try to hire lining engineers and have them accompany the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session we will come back to California or as long as we can , long enough to supervise the mines and set up a system . " He looked toward her hopefully . " Do you think we can do them both , Jessie , or am I being overly ambitious ? " " We can try , darling . Shall we begin work now on the answer to this letter ? " " No , I 'm too tired . I need a night 's sleep ; besides , though it 's difficult to keep track of time in the mountains , it seems to me that it has been a month since I embraced my wife . " " Only a month ? " she murmured . " I would say it was a year . " They spent the next day drafting his free-state , Democratic stand , and is answer to the questions affecting California . The following day he returned to the mines , promising to be back for Christmas . Once again Jessie was alone in her rooms overlooking the Pacific . Christmas approached slowly through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lily could venture forth in such weather ; ul so Jessie would light a half-dozen candles in the tin holders John sent down from San Francisco with the furnishings and go over the pictures in an illustrated London Times . Just two days before the holidayher door was wrenched open , rain swept into the room , then the door was slammed shut . She turned quickly from the fire to see John leaning against a now wet door , panting for breath , his sombrero , face and native jacket drenched , the water running off his high boots in rivuletsonto the floor . " Jessie , I could n't wait , I have ridden from San Jose to greet the first senator 's lady from California . " She cried from her chair , " John , you 've been elected ! " " On the first ballot , " he exulted . " I received twenty-four votes out of thirty-six . William Gwin was elected on the third ballot . We sail for New York on New Year 's Day . " She sprang out of her chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kissing him joyfully . " You 'll get wet , " he laughed . " I 'd better not walk across the room , I 'd make it a pool of water . " " Drop out of those clothes right where you stand , then come to the fire and get warm . I 'll have dry clothes for you in a minute . You must be tired . It 's a seventy-mile ride from San Jose . " After a gay supper of coffee , cold beef and bread , and a bottle of champagne to celebrate their victory , they sprawled out on the warm bear rugs facing the fire , their chins cupped in the palms of their hands , their fingers framing the ovals of their excited faces . " Ah , my dear , " she murmured , " it will be a happy day for me whe I see you in the Senate . I will have that exact scat in the visitors ' galle where Father first put me to listen to him speak when I was only eight . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejoined her husband , " when I se Maylee serving you morning tea in bed . " Later , in the glow of the burned-down eucalyptus logs , they fell aslce on the rugs . At dawn , after a cup of hot coffee , Jessie embraced her hu . band and he left to ride the seventy miles back to San Jose . In festive mood she had Gregorio cut them an evergreen from the hil above the bay and set it in a corner of her living room . Having no orna ments for the tree , she searched through her possessions until she found some old tin foil , rolled it into soft balls and stuck them on the ends of the branches . The tin candleholders she tied to the stronger branches , putting in red and yellow candles . Having opened a can of sardines for lunch , sh had Gregorio cut up the tin into odd shapes and make little holes in the so they could be strung onto the tree , then sent him out to the hotel where she had seen pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gregorio cut this metal roughly into shapes of stars and crescents , which Jessie painted blue and red before hanging on the tree . P253John returned on Christmas Eve with gifts for everyone , a beautiful doll just off the boat from China for his daughter , a soft red cashmere shawl for Jessie , and the first box of candy manufactured in California . The week between Christmas and New Year 's was crowded and exciting . John was busy making arrangements for agents to handle the mines . The Sonorans came down from the Mariposa and took their half of the gold . Jessie had a great deal of packing to do , the furniture had to be stored so that they could have it again when they returned to build a home on the Mariposa . She took a last sentimental walk through the empty rooms , remembering how uncertain their future had been when first they had moved in five months before . The S.S. Oregon came into the harbor at Monterey on New Year 's night , firing its guns to notify the passengers ashore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the streets pouring rivers of mud down to the sea , they trudged to the waterfront followed by Gregorio and another Indian boy carrying their luggage . John lifted her into a rowboat , Gregorio carried Lily . They sat in the downpouring torrents while the two Indian boys rowed them out through the blackness of the night . " Do n't cry so hard , Gregorio , " said Jessie , " you 're waterlogging the beat . We promise to come back soon . " Once again she climbed up a ship 's rope ladder , swaying from side o side as the wind-swept rain buffeted her . The S.S. Oregon stopped at Mazatlan to coal . Consul Parrott , who had fought with Colonel Fremont mid the California Battalion , came aboard to invite them to his thickailedMexican house for dinner . The weather was warm off the coast f Mexico and Jessie had found her Monterey clothes too heavy for comfort . Searching through her bags she discovered a white , ruffled corning sacque to wear with her rough merino skirt . By the time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jessie realized too late that she had made a serious error ; her cough returnedand she was confined to her bunk for the rest of the voyage to Panama . John too was stretched flat on his back , his left side and frostittenleg gripped with rheumatism . Both were taken off the ship on setchers , with Lily , white-faced with worry , watching over them . Again lMadame Arce came to Jessie 's rescue . She took the Fremonts to her home mil installed them in the same bedroom Jessie had occupied eight months fore . She and her servants devoted their full time to nursing the sick couple , concealing from them the fact that Lily was down with Chagres UT , as ill as her parents . They had been scheduled to catch the ship which left Chagres five days ter they had reached Panama City . Instead they lay in their hammocks t Madame Arce 's house for a month . During the last week John was able to hobble around the room , and Jessie 's fever went down . John L. Stephens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each afternoon , murmuring , " I have come to take my chill with you . " When the last day arrived on which they could possibly catch the next steamer to New York , Jessie insisted that she was strong enough to travel . John limped out of the room and went aboard a United States man-ofwarin the harbor . When he returned he said , " We can leave in the morning ; I 've borrowed a ship 's hammock ; we 'll rig an awning over it to keep out the sun , and hire Indian bearers to carry you across Panama . " The next morning John Stephens brought four of his best Indian carriers . Jessie was taken out to her palanquin and lifted into it . Madame Arce settled a crimson silk , lace-trimmed pillow under her head and filled the flat canvas pockets with handkerchiefs and flasks of cologne . John and Lily each had a mule to ride . Lily was recovering , but all of her hair had been shaved off during the fever , and her face was pinched and white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her daughter , but the stolid Lily assured her that she was well again and perfectly able to ride the mule to Gorgona . As the Indian bearers moved through the streets of Panama , the natives came out from their houses to see the strange cortege . After two days and nights on the trail , and two days in the boat going down the Chagres River , during which Jessie stoked herself regularl with quinine and coffee , she at last caught sight of the masts of th  --  steamer . Once in their cabin , she sat on the edge of the berth , ran he hand over her husband 's forehead with her fingers , combed the hair bac from his brow . Then she lay down in the berth alongside of him , motion ing Lily to come into her arms . She lay quietly , one arm about her hu band , the other about her daughter ; the bunk was crowded with the three of them in it , but Jessie did not care ; she was happy to have them all togetheragain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Irving House The manager told them they would have the suite just vacated by Jenn Lind . They walked into the sitting room and stood in the middle of th. room in front of a long French mirror in which Jessie had an opportunit to survey her family . First came Lily ; she had eaten steadily for two weeks aboard ship , was now plump and red-cheeked ; her brown merino dress was too small for her and she seemed to be bursting out of it both fore and aft ; it was also too short , revealing the unbleached muslin panties . She had on a pair of Indian buckskin shoes presented to her by Gregorio , and since her hat had blown overboard , her shaved head was wrapped in a black silk handkerchief , making her look like one of the immigrant children off the boats from Europe.  |p255In  the middle was her husband , dressed in knee-high miner 's boots and his California outfit of miner 's trousers , buckskin jacket , openthroatedshirt and handkerchief tied around his neck , his gray-shot beard lit rimmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home from his expediti , l ls . Then her eyes fell upon herself : emaciated , her pale skin made to look a jaundiced yellow by the rough-fitting , brown satin basque blouse . The dark skirt she had cut out of her riding outfit hung straight andapeless to her ankles , and out of it peeped rusty black satin slippers , the my pair of shoes she had left ; held on to her head with a China crepe arf was a leghorn hat whose color clashed with the brown blouse and lie skirt . To herself she murmured , The senator 's lady from the Golden West ! iss English should see me now ! She had been away a year , six months of it spent in California , the rest travel . She had made no home there , made no real indentation upon c country ; she did not belong , yet she wanted to belong . In the back f her mind she knew that the reason she had failed had been that , in spiteof her lifetime ambition to go west to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholehearted desire to settle there permanently and maket her life . She had gone with the idea that she and her husband would cry soon return to Washington as Senator and Mrs. Fremont . In a sense c had been disloyal to the new land ; perhaps that was why the gods ad refused to consecrate her hearth . If she wanted a hearth in Calirnia , she would have to go there with the idea of remaining forever , yal and devoted , and enduring of hardship . In spite of the battered apparitionof the three of them in the glass , she knew that she did want to go ck to California . Perhaps next time she could become part of the coun- , indigenous to its life . HEY SPENT TWO DAYS getting their land legs , buying clothes , preparingr the train trip to Washington . She had been able to send a telegram her father announcing their safe arrival in New York , a telegram over c wires that Samuel Morse had begged Congress to build for the five an years during which he had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegraph was practical . ' Corn Benton met them at the station , looking old and harassed but .1ppy at welcoming them home . It was the first time she had been away town the family , and it seemed to her that the year had made more thans proportion of changes : her sisters had grown into young ladies ; Randuiph had developed into a tall , pleasant lad with her mother 's finely chiseled features and her father 's slightly hoarse voice ; her mother 's fact and body had grown frail ; her father 's battle-scarred features reflected his heavy burdens . She walked about the house enjoying the smell of rose geraniums in the drawing room , looking with joy at the damask-covered dining table and silver service set out for dinner ; she moved about the library touching the leather-bound books , the arms of comfortable chairs , her writing desk in front of the fireplace . Their friends came in to welcome them and congratulate John on his election . James Buchanan gave a formal dinner in their honor . Jessie ordered a new gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the table flanked by friendly cabinet officers , congressmen , army and navy officers , ambassadors and a considerable portion of Washington society , Jessie and John exchanged a meaningful glance : they remembered how Washington had treated them when they left , with few people calling , the Army wanting no part of their indicted brother , the Cabinet officers remaining away for fear of embarrassing the administration , the congressmenunwilling to take sides . Now they were the darlings of Washingtonsociety , rich with their fabulous California gold , John the first senator from what would soon be the first state of the Far West . Jessie gazed at her husband she saw that he wore his new dinner cloth with poise and dignity but that he looked thin , his gray hair and weathe beaten face making him seem far older than his thirty-seven years . Whe John looked at his wife he saw a young woman of twenty-six with flashing . hazel eyes , brown hair a little thinner than when he had first known he but gleaming richly as it was combed over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; her skin as clear as a child 's in spite of the rigo of Panama and California , her delicate sloping shoulders white and fir and warm to the eye above her Empire gown of deep blue brocad Simultaneously they recalled that moment in the Irving House whe. they had first seen themselves in their crude , garish and ill-fitting clothJessie was delighted to be back in cultivated society . She laughed gaily more intoxicated by the swift flow of conversation than by the many toas she drank to California and its admission as a state . John too had a glca in his eye while he told about the possibility of a railroad to Californi. of the wealth and beauty of the state ; but mostly their eyes sought cm : . other , for they could not believe that they were back in Washington , j as though nothing had happened to them . James Buchanan leaned over and murmured to her , " Miss Jessie , do n't think you should engage in flirtation with your husband while si ting next to me . " " Flirtation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such , " he replied , " a mental wink , a flash of the rye , a fleeting smile . . . I am beginning to suspect that your husband I , loves you . " " An unwarranted hypothesis , " laughed Jessie . " He is so stunned at seeing me in an evening gown , after my unbleached muslin and black merinos , that he can hardly believe his eyes . " There was a week of parties and dinners and fun , and then they settled clown to work . Behind the closed door of the library , Thomas Hart Bentiinadmitted to his young daughter that his position in the Senate was in danger . His long fight to prevent the extension of slavery had consolidatedthe slavery men of Missouri against him , and after thirty years of service it was growing apparent that they had a chance to defeat him in the coming election . The focal center of the slavery battle was now California : since its own legislature had declared California to be a free state , the slavery men in the Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union . Tom Benton thus faced a painful dilemma : for thirty . years he had been working to bring the Pacific coast into the United States ; he had ulways been opposed to the extension of slavery beyond the existing southern states ; but if he fought for the admission of California as a free Late , his waging of the battle would afford the last round of ammunition heeded to put him out of the United States Senate . John was a senator-elect from California , but California was not yet state and so actually he had no job . Officially there was little he could o to hasten the admission , but unofficially the Fremonts served as goodillambassadors and an information service on the topography , climate RI general future of that territory . Through the Benton home on C ti eel moved a large section of official Washington . Many of those who ad been skeptical about the distant land left at the end of the evening aving caught some of their enthusiasm . Neither Jessie nor John had anticipated a serious struggle over the admission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of settlers into its boundaries , and en refuse to incorporate it within the nation ? Nevertheless the weeks d the months passed , the beautiful spring merged into the hot summer Id the hot summer spent itself into an early fall while the slavery lacinmaneuvered to gain ever increased concessions as the price of adingCalifornia . John utilized some of his leisure to buy mining equipment which he ipped out to San Francisco . After the third of his buying junkets , dur-g which he laid out a great deal of cash , he informed Jessie that he was ing to have to capitalize the Mariposa , issue leases on certain of the Ines , and sell stock in them . This would provide the capital to build dams , roads and buy other expensive equipment so necessary for largescalemining . She was disturbed at the idea , for it meant setting up in business ; there would be stockholders , managers and boards , control would eventually be taken from John 's hands , he would be responsible to a great many people . She asked her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine on a small scale and remain the master of his mines . He laughingly replied : " Jessie , you sound as though you did n't want us to take too much gold out of the Mariposa . Do n't you like money ? " " Yes , I love money , " she exclaimed . " But like every other vice , it should be indulged in moderately . Besides , I think you 're meant for more important things than just making money . Did I ever tell you what Nicollet said about money ? He said that the accumulation of money was a period of affliction , like adolescence , which we had to pass through before we could reach maturity . I 'd like to take just a modest amoun of gold out of the Mariposa , John , enough to buy you the freedom and financing for whatever work may appeal to you : further expeditions , mapping a railroad route to California , building wagon roads to the West . I do n't think the Mariposa gold should be an end , I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life and your work . Or do I soup . like a moralistic schoolteacher ? " " You sound like a schoolteacher . . . and you sound right . However one can not fly in the teeth of fate ; the gods dumped a Mother Lode int. , my lap ; to do less than exploit it to its fullest , to refuse to extract th  --  millions of gold from those quartz lodes would be like refusing to accept the gifts of the gods . " " Yes , " she agreed thoughtfully , " I can see that point of view . But di . it ever occur to you that the gods might also appreciate a bit of restraint That it might be the better part of virtue not to gobble up their gifts When the slavery men at Monterey told you that you could be the richman in the world if you would use slave labor in your mines , you said that was too high a price to pay for wealth . Then why is n't giving yo own life to digging out gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you a free workman than a bounden mine owner . " John did not agree , and so an English agent by the name of Hoffm ' was given the right to sell leases on the Ave Maria , West Mariposa an . East Mariposa mines . The agreement signed , Hoffman took the next shi ' j to England to set up stock companies , the proceeds of which were to I sent to John to turn the three mines into major producing units . A fe weeks later she learned that her husband was dealing with a second ages by the name of Thomas Sargent , giving him the right to sell leases fo half of the vast Mariposa tract . Sargent also planned to go to EnglandP259to sell stock in the company . She had no wish to intrude upon her husband'sbusiness arrangements , and she was reassured by the fact that her father approved of Sargent and the granting of the additional leases . On the morning of September 10 , 1850 , when John Charles Fremont was to be presented to the United States Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creamed her face , dressed partially , then sat before her dressigtable to brush her long brown hair and coil it low on her neck . When is tried to rise to put on her gown there swept over her the same wave f nausea that she had suffered while carrying her son . She laughed gaily o herself as she thought , California may be fertile country , but Washnigtonis the better conceiving ground ! She rode with her husband and her father up to the Senate ; they were gay as children , laughing at silly jokes , yet there was an undertone of atality about it , for Tom Benton knew that the South was rapidly losing is temper , growing angry and frightened , that this might well be his st session . He had always wanted to die in the seat behind his Senate desk , in the midst of a fiery debate ; yet if he had to be dispossessed now , o down to defeat as one of the first casualties of the threatening conduct between the North and the South , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take his place , that California from 840 to 1870 would be the frontier of freedom and the capital of the est , just as Missouri had been during his thirty years from 182o to 185o . Jessie took her accustomed seat in the front row of the visitors ' gallery cross from the eagle poised on top of the canopy which covered the peaker 's chair . Below were seated the senators from thirty-one states , in their long , tight black trousers held down by straps under the heels of cir boots , their long-tailed , square-cut black coats and the wide lapels which framed the bow tie and white shirt . She believed that her husband was the youngest man on the floor . She also thought him the handsomest . She glowed with pride as she watched him being sworn in as a United States senator . In the three weeks that remained of the session she worked hard asOlin 's secretary . Her experiences as a traveler , housewife and mothergabled her to help her husband . Yet John needed little help : she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AI ( hough he was no lawyer , he dictated bills to extend the laws of thejudicial system of the United States to California , bills to grant publiclands for purposes of education and the building of universities , asylumsit the deaf and dumb , the blind and the insane , bills to record landes , settle land claims , to negotiate the working of mines , for a systempost roads and national roads to California . She saw that Californiaas indeed being well represented . His eighteen bills to facilitate the mi-P26ogration of the people westward , and for the internal developments of California , were all passed by the Senate . At the end of the session even those southerners who had so bitterly opposed the introduction of California , Barnwell , Davis , Calhoun , Clay , congratulated Senator Fremont on his legislative program . Jessie carried the new child well , strong and happy and hopeful abou.t the future . She indulged herself not at all , went for long walks , dance . at the frequent balls . On the afternoon that the Senate adjourned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to California to stand for re-elec tion ? " After a moment of hesitation John replied . " He is n't going . At least not yet . . . " She blinked uncomprehendingly . " He is n't going to stand for r election ? But that 's not like Gwin . He told me himself he 's determine . to remain a senator from California . " " Yes , that 's true . But you know , Jessie , we have a long term and short term . " " You were elected to the long term . You have another five years . . . " . John shook his head . " Neither of us was elected to the long term . I know you have been assuming all along , Jessie , that I had the long term , ' and you were so happy about it I just hated to put any doubts in you mind . " Her cheeks flamed . " But why should I have had any doubts ? You received an overwhelm ing majority of votes . That makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the six-year term . " " The election laws do n't say so . Gwin and I have to draw lots for it . ' She lost her temper . " It 's too utterly preposterous , John , that you should agree to gambl over a seat in the Senate . What about fighting for your rights ? I don ' understand you , this is out of character ; two thirds of the people in Cali fornia meant for you to have the long term . Gwin has no real stake i California : he went out there as a political adventurer , determined t  --  pull the prize plum out of the pie ! What does he know about California What part did he play in making California an American state , excep trying to get it to go proslavery at the convention ? Your expeditions an . reports are responsible for half the families that are now living out there You played a critical role in the conquest of the state ; kept it from fall ing into British hands . You know every valley and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what their needs are , they trust you ta do important things for them here in Washington . . . " She slumped down into her chair , her anger burnt out .   " I 'm sorry I shouted at you , dear , but it just seems so incongruous for the first citizen of California to gamble over a senatorial seat with a politicaladventurer . There is no rhyme or reason in it . " He sat beside her and brushed the tears from her eyes with a hard cirMarmotion of his palm . " There 's nothing I can do , Jessie ; what you suggest would cause a sandal . People would say that it was another of John Fremont 's uprisings , a mutiny against established tradition . Do n't you see , there 's no law to sustain me ; it has always been a gentlemen 's agreement that two senatorselected from a new state must draw lots for the long and short terms . " His reference to another John Fremont uprising quieted her . " Your stand against slavery has earned you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " at the end of a six-year term you will have made friends with them , you will have done so much good work for California that you will be re-elected again and again for thirty full years , the way Father has from Missouri . But if you go back now after only three weeks in the Senate , the slavery group will fight you tooth and nail . " John 's black eyes peered at her unhappily . " We have to take our chances ; we have to draw lots . Wish me luck , clear . I 'm going to draw the long term . " She smiled a little wistfully , kissed the niche in the corner of his mouth . " Of course you will , " she said . There was no need for John to tell her the next day when he returned home , his face a polite but withdrawn mask , that he had drawn the short term . The thirty-year career in the Senate had evaporated to three short weeks ! Another turn of the wheel of fortune : when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold , they were elected , they returned to Washingtontriumphant . Then the wheel turned again , thousands of gold seekers flooded their lands ; they had to incorporate and give away contrrol over their property ; the senatorial career was ended almost as it began . SHE OCCASIONALLY ACCOMPANIED John to New York to buy the modern mining equipment with which to dig their tunnels into the sides of the 11 ariposa . He decided to spend the New Year holiday in Washington , then take the ship that left New York on January 2 , 1851 . She had a long session with herself in which she weighed the comparativesof her problem : she was six months with child ; though the roughnessof the sea voyage was not too formidable a danger , the crossing of Panama might be . Having lost young Benton , this coming child meant twice as much to both of them ; on the other hand she could not bear ; the thought of another long separation from her husband . She knew that with John to watch over her she would be well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there fear in her heart : this was the oppor. tunity to demonstrate that she had the makings of the pioneer wife , that she meant to create a home and a hearth in California . This was her challenge , more serious and more important than her first lonely trip had ' ' . been : to carry inside her the new generation of the frontier , to give birth to her baby in the almost unborn community . " I wo n't be gone so very long , Jessie , " he assured her , " just lon enough to stand for re-election and to see that the mine machinery installed . I will be back in Washington by July . " " You mean we will be back in Washington by July , " she replied calmly . " I 'm going with you . " A look of terror flashed into his eyes . " But you ca n't . . . We ca n't risk the child . The rigors of crossing Panama . . . " She stood resolutely before him , tossing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We have nothing to fear , " she said . " I never felt stronger , and I ant positive that this is a healthy child I am carrying . If you are going to California , the children and I are going with you . Your son is going to be born in California . " " But Jessie , " he protested , " the ocean is rough in winter . You have to go over the Gorgona trail by muleback . . . " " No , no , " she cried , " I will go over the trail in my palanquin . I had a comfortable ride last time . I 've learned many things about Panama : I 'm taking my own tea things , canned foods that are easy to prepare and digest . The passage will be swifter now , with so many thousands of Americans having made the crossing . Please , let 's not discuss it . There ' confidence in my heart , and that is the best protection our child could have . " They sailed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough so Jessie stayed in her berth and slept through them . Lily kept her fathe company on deck . At Chagres a little wharf had been built , and she did not have to bob around in a tender . John had sent money and instructions ahead , so there was a boat to convey them up the Chagres to Gorgona . She got bumped around a little in her canopied hammock over the moun. taro trail , but she laughed at the hardship and felt not the slightest worry . They arrived in San Francisco early in April . When she landed at the broad wooden pier and caught her first glimpse of the town she was gladP263she had made her decision , for the city had grown miraculously , many homes had sprung up , hundreds of workmen were sawing and pounding , there were wooden sidewalks and Market Street was an imposing area of %kite-front hotels and business firms . She did not want her child to be born in a hotel , she wanted him to be born at her own hearth , so they set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one they could find was an ugly wooden frame structure high up on Stockton Street overlooking the Portsmouth Square . There was no interiordecoration , the walls were bare , but the rooms were large and the furnishings comfortable . They bought the house and moved in . On the morning of April 15 she gave birth to a son , whom they promptly named John Charles . Gregorio had come running to join his family again . When the nurse announced that she would leave at the end of the first week , Gregorio said laughingly , " My mother had ten babies , I helped raise seven of them . I know everything to do . I take care of Charlie when the nurse go . " Jessie remained in bed while John went about San Francisco hiring mechanics for the mines , buying supplies , checking the homes and shops that had been built on the land he had bought before leaving for Washington . A committee of Australians who had established a colony on the Fremont holdings came to the house and presented to her a petition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they could feel permanently settled . She promised to urge their request on her husband . That evening she asked John to sell the Australians the property , pointing out that these people were as anxious for their own hearths as they were . When the baby was fifteen days old , and she was rocking him in an improvised crib , she heard alarmed shouts below her . A few moments later she smelled smoke . Sending for Gregorio , she demanded to know s hat was happening . " There 's a fire on the south side of the square . " " Is it coming this way ? " Gregorio went to the bedroom window and called back , " I ca n't tell where the fire come , but the wind come this way . " At that moment John rushed in with extra blankets and a grass hammock . " There 's nothing to be alarmed about , " he said reassuringly , " but we must be prepared . The houses below us on the hill are catching . If the fire rises much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Russian Hill . The sand dunes will keep the fire from reaching there . I 've Ircady sent over our silverware and papers . " " I 've ridden in hammocks before , " she replied calmly ; " just give me wo minutes ' notice to prepare Charlie . "   By nightfall all of San Francisco was aglow , the air filled with smoke and flying ash . From her bed Jessie could watch the night sky grow redder 1 and redder . Friends thronged up the hill to help John hang wet canvas and soaked carpet over the side of the house to prevent sparks from setting it aflame . Below her she could hear the shouts of the men fighting the fires ; by the growing intensity and the heat she knew that the flames were coming ever higher on the hill . The sidewalks , made of wooden plank carried the flames , and the crackling fires of the wooden houses mingle with the sounds of the fire bells and shouts of the men dashing throug the streets trying to save their properties . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fire bega. racing south again across the square . Their home was saved . The next morning , leaning on the arm of her husband , Jessie circle  --  the house to survey the damage . Below her most of the city lay in ashes The paint was blistered on her own home , but there was no other damage It was n't until she had gone back into the house and climbed into be . again that she realized her calm of the night before had been the same kind of ' protection with which she had insulated herself for the trip acro Panama . At the end of a month , when her strength had returned , and th machinery had arrived for the mines , John left for . the Mariposa to begi the installation work . He was standing for re-election , yet he would d. nothing to promote his candidacy . Jessie wondered why her husband declined to strive as mightily for the political office he wanted as he has striven to make himself a successful engineer . Electioneering demande. that a man get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking to eve group that assembled , that he keep a steady stream of articles flowing t  --  the press , that he treat politics as though it were a business or a professio  --  and throw himself into it wholeheartedly if he expected to achieve th desired result . But John would not electioneer and would not campaig As he had in Monterey , he said quietly to his wife : " Everyone in this state knows me and knows whether or not he wan me to continue being senator . Shaking a few thousand hands won change the results of the election ; if the majority of the people in this sta are in favor of slavery , then I 'll be defeated ; if the majority are in fay . of freedom , then I 'll be sent back to the Senate . No one is going to chang the mind of a slavery man by making a speech at him ; and besides I ' not a good speechmaker . " She respected his reticence , his refusal to fight for his seat in the Senat : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hi She would have been entirely willing to take her carriage and the team horses and stump the state , speaking in every hamlet and village , debatinP265with the slavery faction . But alas , there was nothing she could do ; a wife would not campaign for her husband , and surely a wife could not urge t hat a man plunge himself into public conflict if it was against his ternpcrament to do so . And once again she was puzzled by the riddle of her husband 's chara ( ter . Why , under one set of circumstances , did he grasp more power and ; authority than he was entitled to , then in another field be modest , selfeffacing , refuse to play the critical part which everyone expected of him ? Was he behaving this way because the court-martial had declared him to he a usurper , a man seeking personal power and fame  --  and he wanted to live down the accusation ? Or did this contradiction in his temperament arise from the various components within his mind : the components dealingwith politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Army another and very different set ? Only she knew how many dozens of separately locked compartments there were , and how divergent their contents . She remembered how in the first days of her honeymoon she had dimly perceived that marriage might mean the spending of a lifetime trying to understand her mate , evolving the mysteries of character which even he did n't know were there . She had said to herself then , I would not want a titan who would be obvious . It will be an exhilarating pursuit , trying to understand what will come next , fitting all the pieces together . And what a great hour it will be , ten years from now , fifty years from now , when 1 finally understand John . She had now been married for ten years , she understood many fragments of her husband 's behavior , and yet she had to confess to herself that she was no closer to a solution of his character than she had been the day she married him . San Francisco was growing at an amazing rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shop for rare art objects or furnishings from the Orient , wines or sweets from Paris , woolens from England . On one of her trips she was delighted to find two sets of violet-colored muslin curtains , which she tied back with pink ribbons to brighten the parlor and dining room . There were a flourishing newspaper and theater ; thousands of people were coming in from overland trails and by ship from Australia and the Orient . They were a conglomerate crew : along with the eastern farmers and settlers , the staid businessmen and the gold seekers , there was a large crowd of British criminals released from Botany Bay in Australia , well as the irresponsible Guarde Mobile which had been shipped over fn m Paris for the greater safety of France ; there were the wild ones , the professional adventurers and gamblers , the thieves , embezzlers , swindlers , **27;9078;TOOLONG and Molly had been friends since they were little girls . He said , " I 'll get you a drink , " and walked into the kitchen . He opened the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on air . He touched one of the ice-bergs with his finger . It did not move . There must be some implements somewhere in this kitchen , hammers , knives . . . When he and Ed Ware and Bob Upchurch roomed together on Brooklyn Heights Ed used to hide the kitchen knives every night because he , Jim , walking in his sleep , had once chased Ed with a knife . . . Directly below the refrigerator trays some crystal clear , gelatinous substance , oblong in shape , protruded from a yellow bowl . He consideredinserting it in Molly 's glass in lieu of ice , rejected the idea and , slamming the refrigerator door shut , found two glasses and filled diem full of whiskey mixed with water from the tap . She accepted the drink and a cigarette that he found for her in a box on the table . She lifted the glass to her lips and made a childish face . " You might at least have put cold water in it , " she said . " It 's bad for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more cigarettes in the box , and he had smoked the last one from the packet that he had had in his pocket . He saw another box on a table in the corner and walked towards it . Down . . . Molly had said . He did not at this moment know where his wife was and yet , during these three weeks , he had seemed to know . On the West Coast . The morning of the day she left they had been reading , at breakfast , a letter from Helen Tyrrell , a girl Catherine had gone to school with . Helen had just landed a small part in a Goldwyn pro-pI01duction and wanted Catherine to come out for a visit . They had discussed whether they could afford for her to make the trip . He remembered disguising his feelings as they talked . He had wanted her to go . He had wanted to be here in this apartment , alone . That was because he had thought that he was in love with Edith . It strains the nerves to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command of another , unless you are a man who delights in secrecy , in betrayal for its own sake . But he was not that kind of man . He had thought that he was in love with Edith . There had been times in the last few months when he had actually flinched at the sound of Catherine 's voice , had wished that for a while , at least , he could be separated from her . . . But finding that note on the typewriter had been like a blow in the face . Since then he had not been able to get his mind off her . In his mind he had accompanied her on her journey , as he thought , to the Coast . There had been one night when he could not sleep , seeing over and over a wet , black road , a car , skidding from it , to crash in a ravine . On the fifth day he had said to himself : She is there now , and safe . If anything had happened to her I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other papers she carried in her purse would identify her . . . But down . . . Molly would not have said " down " if it had been the West Coast . The silver box was empty . Behind him Molly spoke : " Have you forwarded any of her mail ? " " No , " he said . " That 's why she has n't answered any of my letters , " she said angrily . " I would n't even have known where she was , if Mrs. Manigault had n't written Sarah Cotham . " Softly he replaced the cover on the little box . Mrs. Mani-pIO2 gault , he thought . Long Island ? No . Mrs. Manigault had sold that place before she went abroad to live . But , of course . The Manigaults had an old place in Tennessee , next to Swan Quarter . He came back and sat down opposite Molly . As he lowered his long body into the chair he realized that he was very tired . He drank the warm whiskey and water . Swan Quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was three weeks now . Those letters in there on her desk . In the morning he would put them all in a big envelope and forward them to her .. . They were not on her desk . They were in a drawer , hidden under a pile of his dress shirts . He had thrust them there last Saturday , when he came in and found Lily standing , her dust cloth over her arm , holding a letter in her hand . Her dark face , bent over the letter , had been solemn and intent , as if she hoped that a scrutiny of the superscription might reveal the whereabouts of the person to whom it was addressed .. . Lily was in the apartment when Catherine left . She must have suspected something . Suspected what ? That his wife had left him ? Well , if she had , he did not have to give an account of himself to a negro maid  --  or to this woman sittinghere before him . But he had known her a long time . A more pertinacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until she had spoken her mind . He had better let her get on with it . He set his glass down . He said , " Molly , I realize how fond you are of Catherine  --  and of me , too . But had you thought  --  I mean you may have to be fond of us separately . You know I am ten years older than Catherine . . . " She made a gesture of dissent , almost of disgust . " Don'tpI03feed me any of that stuff , Jim . I know what 's the matter with you and Catherine . " " What is the matter ? " he asked quietly . " You 're in love with another woman . At least you 're having an affair with her . " There was a silence , then he said , " Who is she ? " She made another abrupt gesture with a silver paper cutter that she had taken from the table beside her . " I do n't know  --  and I do n't care . It 's been perfectly obvious for weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He thought of the woman to whom she referred , a tall , blue-eyed girl , who , like him , came from a small town in Ohio and taught history for a living . She lived in an apartmenthouse on East Seventieth Street . For several months he had been going there to see her , secretly . They had once spent a week-end together , in Boston . . . But he could swear that Edith Ross had never met Molly Ware or any of her friends . He was annoyed to find muscles in his cheek tensing . The flesh itself felt brittle , as if defenseless to a thrust that she might make with the paper knife . It was all the mask that he  --  or any one else  --  had , and yet , as she said , it could be penetrated by a second sharp glance . " It 's possible that my  --  peculiar conduct may be due to something else , " he said . " Have you ever considered that my work makes extraordinary demands ? " She shook her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , and added contemptuously , " Your work ! Jim , I may be dumb  --  in fact I know I am  --  but I 'm not dumb enough to think it 's your work . Bob says that 's the trouble , really . " " Bob ? " he asked , frowning. pI04 " Yes , Bob , " she repeated , pronouncing with a defiant ring the name of the friend with whom they had both once been so intimate and whom they now rarely saw . " We were all at Pete 's the other night . " He leaned back in his chair and , crossing one leg over the other , carefully adjusted the crease in his trousers before he said in a faintly sarcastic tone , " And just what does Bob think is my trouble ? " " Oh , he says it 's all too easy for you . You can run rings around the ordinary professor , and yet there 's just enough work to take the edge off your mind . . . He says you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turning his head with a quick motion so that he gazed past her out on to the street . Seeing his profile against the white blind she remembered how , when as a young girl she had first met him , she had thought , seeing the big nose and the lock of hair jutting over his forehead , like the crest of some bird , that he was one of those men whom you could describe as " hawk-like . " He had seemed to her fitted for bold , decisive actions in which he would not stop to reckon the consequences . In her provincial ignorance she had been surprised when they told her that he wrote books . He was turning his face back towards her . " A moral collapse , eh ? Well , Bob ought to be an authority on moral problems . " She felt tears springing to her eyes . She lowered her gaze to the floor and blinked her lashes . " Bob has n't had any moral collapse , " she said dully . " IIe 's just gone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's filthy in him to get three hundreda minute or whatever it is over the radio , but I do n't seep105that it would help things if he refused . It 's the set-up . And he has to make a living . " " I 'm not suggesting that he stage a one-man revolution , " he said in a tone that he had never used to her before , bland but acrid . " Perhaps the fault lies with his sponsors . Duke and Crosby  --  or is it Bates and Sanborn ? " " It 's ci-cigars , " she said , " Manuelo y  --  something . " A tear rolled down her cheek . She shook her head angrily and stood up . " I 've got to go , " she said . He was on his feet . She knew that in order to show that there had been no breach between them he would insist on accompanying her downstairs and finding her a taxi . She put her hand out , palm up , in a gesture of refusal . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door she turned and spoke again : " If you do n't care anything about yourself you might think about your friends . Think of Ed , sitting there , night after night , writing those heads and then going out and getting drunk . I used to fuss but now I know he could n't stand that damn desk without it . But the doctor says his kidneys ... " She was crying now , into a handkerchief that , with shaking hands , she had rummaged out of her bag . He knew that he must not go to her and stood , silent , his eyes on the floor , while she wiped her eyes . She finished and , stuffing the handkerchief back into the bag , lifted a streaked face in which the brown eyes , ringed by fatigue and emotion , looked more owlish than ever . " You ought to care , " she said , " he just adores you , " and slammed the door . He heard her footsteps in the little hall and then the outer door closed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  | drank slowly , then set the glass back on the table and , going to the window , stood looking down at the street . Adore , he thought . A queer word to use of such an ungainly , lonely man as he was . There had never been anybody who adored him . That girl , Edith Ross , was in love with him now , he supposed . But she could just as easily fall in love with somebody else . With Wilkins , for instance . The women all admiredWilkins ... Swan Quarter . . . So that was where she had been all along . It was strange that he had not known it . But why had she gone there ? She had a kind of dread of the place and sometimes , walking along Fifth Avenue , would hurry into a shop to buy fine woolen garments for the old lady , a fleece-lined jacket for the old maid aunt . You do n't know how cold it is , huddling over grate fires . . . Aunt Willy is out in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had made a visit there , once , soon after they were married , at his suggestion . Catherine had not much wanted to go . They had driven down and as they passed through the Lewis ' market town of Carthage , Catherine had insisted on stopping and loading the car with soap , loaves of bread , cheese , heads of lettuce , even a great roast of beef . " We can drive in any day and buy anything we want , " he had told her . " I know , but something might happen . The car might not go . Things always get out of fix at Swan Quarter . " The two women , who did not own an automobile and could not have driven it if they had , lived in great isolation . Their only communication with the outside world , except for chance visits from relatives and neighbors , was through an old negro man who , twice a week , drove in to CarthagepI07for supplies . And yet the place was not as run-down as he had expected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he had lived happily in much more primitive quarters in Europe . It was the isolation that gave the place its melancholy aspect , not far from the highway but deep in a wood and circled by water ; the creek made a great bend that took in all the land except a ridge next to the Manigault place . When Catherine was a child she had alwaysgone back there in the summers . Had the isolation that she had known there set its mark on her ? Her mother , though she had lived in New York for fifteen years , always seemed to have that old farm in the back of her mind . On a February night she would walk to the window and look down on the lights and the river , saying , " The jonquils are blooming now at Swan Quarter , " or , " Willy 's nursing twins now . " Ewes , when they bore twins , often refused to suckle one which then had to be raised by hand . Catherine still talked about an orphan lamb that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her room . Over the mantel hung a picture of a great-aunt dead in infancy . The child , who had died long ago on a summer day of a surfeit of ripe peaches , had looked down all through her childhood on the child Catherine . The house he had grown up in had been sold soon after his mother 's death . He had been abroad when his mother died and had desperately needed the small amount of money that would come to him from the estate ; so the house , a white frame house on a quiet street , had been sold . He had not thought that he would ever go back to Mount Hope ; so he had sold the furniture too , reserving only the books . The friend of his mother 's who had packed the books and shipped them to him had included one or two things that she had evidently thought he would want as keepsakes : a cushion that had lain in the rocking chair in which his mother alwayssat beside the sunniest window to sew , some old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence he had hardly been aware , the family silver . He had not remembered until he looked over the things how many objects go to make up a household . His wife sometimesused the silver , his father 's and mother 's photographs sat on his dresser , but the rest of the things , packed in a long box , were stored in a warehouse here in the city . " But 1 might carry them about with me , " he thought , " like the boxes of his native Carpathian earth that Count Dracula took with him to London . " He had not sold his father 's books . They were ranged on a shelf on the east wall . He went over and took one out : adark , worn copy of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire . A great man for Gibbon , his father . He would come in from a late call and , taking off his shoes , sit and warm his feet over the lint air register and read far into the night . And the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read ; he had the faculty of making it seem contemporaneous . He could remember now the old man 's indignation over the figure Heliogabalus cut when he entered Rome : in silk robes , his checks painted , his eyes mascaraed like a girl 's . And the senator Julian ! For some reason he had thought very highly of Julian and grieved when he accepted the imperial crown . " Could n't he see that he was signing his death warrant ? " pI09A tall , lean man , the doctor , with a sharp chuckle and an air of dispassionate benevolence that never left him . " Well , Joe , if I were you I believe I 'd . . . " He would hook his thumbs through his vest and with his head , sparsely covered with graying hair , a little on one side , calmly and kindly consider what he would do if he were Joe Sienckewicz and had a wife and four children and an incurable disease . He had lived in Mount Hope ever since he first came there to practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of it as home . " The people here . . . " he would say or , " In this part of the country . . . " Once , when Jim , a boy of ten , had accompanied him on a country call he had driven a mile off the road , to the top of a high hill . They had sat there awhile , looking off over the country . Before they left he leaned forward and pointed with his whip to a faraway , green eminence . " That looks a little like the Green Mountains , " he said . He was probably always wanting to get back to the Green Mountains , his son thought . I do n't feel that way about Mount Hope . But perhaps that feeling of his kept us from ever really belonging in Ohio . Or was it something in the soil itself ? He had heard his father commenting , with his dry chuckle , on the way the Ohio farmer who had accumulated enough money sold his farm and came to town to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer , he said , would stay by his land till he died and then have to be carried off feet first . Was there something in the land itself that repelled human attachments ? Perhaps it was too fertile . Roots put down easily are not as enduring as those which make their waypIIO through the interstices of rock . The richest , most persistent civilizations have flourished on the barren slopes of the Mediterranean , where man has to conserve every inch of soil . He had heard his Provencal landlady exult over the death of a twenty-seven-year-old horse . " It had arrived for him to die . Now he will help make next year 's garden . " Middle Westerners , springing out of the rich , black loam of the prairie , are always on their way somewhere else .. . I never felt at home but once in my life , he thought . And that was in that room over on Eighth Avenue . The telephone rang , once and then again , a long , insistent peal . That was Edith , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but instead , crossed the room and sat down . Flinging himself back in the deep chair he put his hand up to his forehead , pressing his eyes shut with outspread fingers , as if the same fingers that shut out sight could shut out sound . The room on Eighth Avenue had been distemperedpale blue , but long ago . Soot and grease and the occasional overflow of bursting pipes had laid strange stripings of green over the blue . Bob Upchurch had once taken an eraser and rubbed a small section of the wall clean , leaving the green streaks thrusting like giant , Rousseauistic ferns to the ceiling : T. S. Eliot 's rat , he said , creeping softly through the vegetation . There was an iron bed , so frail that it creaked when you turned over , a table and two chairs , one for him to sit on while he wrote and one , as Bob said , " for solitude . " There had also been a shelf , high on the wall , where he set his frying pan and dishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove had had only one eye and would not hold ap111frying pan and a kettle of water at the same time . The coal that fed it was kept in a big box outside in the hall , along with the kindling and some old newspapers . Making the fire on winter mornings was the worst part . After he got it going well the room would heat up . But only for a time ; the fire had to be replenished every hour . But he would forget that when he got to writing , forget even that there was a stove until , after midnight , when the room would grow colder and he would get up , and with his eyes still on the words he had just written , take his overcoat down from its hook and in that brief pause , the only one that he might know before daybreak , become aware of the silence that had settled over the city , a silence that in those small hours used to grow and deepen until , miraculously , it found a voice and spoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion he had ever had . He replaced the book upon the shelf and turned , listening , as he gazed about the room . But the silence , after all those years , gave back no sound.  |p112WHEN  HE HAD COME out of the apartment building he hadwalked east and then , at Third Avenue , had turned downtown . And for several hours he had been walking beside the Elevated . It was dark overhead ; lights were burning in all the shops . Back there it had been junk shops ; now it was delicatessens and fish . There was something familiar in the way that eel coiled itself about a heap of shell-fish . He stepped up to a window and looked in . A miniature castle reared itself in a huge abalone shell in the corner , a small turtle peering gloomily out from under its draw-bridge , and back in the sawdust three dark , white-aproned men sat playing cards around a backless chair . He had come here once , with Catherine , to buy mussels . An extremely cold day in winter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No mussel  --  no clam  --  no dig this weather , " he said and jerked his thumb to the east . Catherine , not able to connect the ninety-mile gale that for three days had beaten the Atlantic coast with this shop , had been at first incredulous , then annoyed . She had six people coming for dinner and had promised them moult 's marim'res . The party had been for Ellen Page . He had never liked Ellen but later he had been glad to have somebody in the apartment besides himself and Catherine . The dinner party had been on Saturday night , the night before he had seduced Edith Ross . Friday  --  or was it Thursdaythat he had gone to her apartment to work on those papers ?  |p113Where  you going , Mister ? Chapman stepped back quickly , then moved aside . The grimy hand fell from his arm . He walked on down the street . Wo n't the gentleman give me something for a cup of coffee ? " No , " Chapman said and walked faster . An odd COFFEE POT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaping over the letters . The one that leaped from T to E had less work to do than the one that leaped from E to C. If you turned your head you could see what they did when they came to the end of the letters , and if you wanted something to eat you could cut over to Madison or Lexington . I do n't want anything to eat , but I could do with a drink . Seduce . That was the word , all right . She never made any play for me . That time in my office when we were talking and she suddenly stopped and walked to the window and I thought , " My God , she 's thinking the same thing I am ! " but she said afterwards that she was n't , that such a thought never entered her head . Not then , she said , but another time , when we were standing on the street and talking and Wilkins came along and said something about her hair , the way the wind was blowing it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it then , she said . But it would n't have happened if I had n't gone to her apartment that night . Catherine tried to keep me at home : the Wares were coming in after dinner . She was kneeling by the fire , doing Ellen 's hair a new way before they came . It does n't make any difference how they do Ellen 's hair . Her face always looks like a hickory nut . Catherine likes women like that . She had hairpins in her mouth . She did n't even look up . " Oh , he works almost every night . And he has the most attractive girl to help him . Her name is Ethel Ross . " I said , " Her name is Edith . She 's pretty damn good . " It was raining when I got out on the street . She had.a fire , too . The bricks in her hearth are yellow , not red like ours . She had on one of those long , soft dresses that they wear in the house . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so short . It was after we had finished the papers and she went into the kitchen for the bread and cheese . I followed her . I laid my hand on her arm . She turned around quick . She said , " Jim , what is it ? " I knew then that I still had time to get out of it . But I did n't want to . He had stopped and was staring into a window where a dozen bottles were pyramided on a papier mache revolving stand . " I did n't want to , " he said aloud . Coon Hollow spun slowly out of sight and was succeeded by Old Taylor . He became aware that he was not alone . The bum was standing a foot away . " God , you stink ! " Chapman said . " Is it dirt or that stuff they disinfect you with ? " The man looked at him , then his eyes went back to the window . " I ca n't help it , " he muttered . " Charley wo n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't blame Charley , " Chapman said . The man slowly took his eyes from the revolving bottles . He shuffled closer to Chapman . The acrid odor , stirred by the movement , rose and hung in the air between them . The bum 's face showed red through grayish bristles . His eyelids ,  |p115ga|ping  under pale blue eyes , showed a deeper , almost arterial red . " You go to the Army , " he said , " they put your stuff in the machine efery night . Do n't make no difference how often you come . They put it in . Efery night . " " Salvation Army ? " Chapman said absently . " I suppose they 've got to get the lice out of ' em some way . . . Why wo n't Charley let you sleep in his house ? " The man shrugged his shoulders . " Thinks you stink , eh ? How come he 's so particular ? " The bum shook his head . " I do n't know . He a coloredfellow . " He shuffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cup of coffee ? " Chapman drew back . " I 'm not a gentleman , " he said , " I 'm a scholar . . . Yes , I 'll buy you a drink . " They entered the bar . " Two double Scotches , straight , " Chapman told the bartender . The bartender turned to the shelf behind him , then paused , his hand on the bottle he had been about to take down . Chapman laid a bill on the counter . " This is a friend of mine , " he said . " You want to give him a drink , or do I take him to some other bar ? " The bartender leaned forward . " Mind taking him over there ? " he said in a hoarse whisper , and pointed to a booth in the far corner . " Not at all , " Chapman said . " He prefers to sit down . Come on , pal . " They walked over to the booth . A boy brought the whiskies . " You 'd better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " What 'll it be , pal ? " He turned to the boy . " What have you got ? " The boy , staring over his head , indicated with a gesture the menu stuck behind a metal napkin holder . Chapman unfolded the greasy menu and read : " Spaghetti , with meat balls . . . Chili . . . Mexican Red Hot Tamales . . . Irish Stew . . . What 'll it be , pal ? " he repeated impatiently . The bum 's mouth , half open , showed pale gums , rotten , broken teeth . He murmured " Chili , " then shook his head . " Spaghetti , " he said . " Spaghetti and meat balls . " Closing his lips firmly he fixed Chapman 's face with his watery blue eyes . " One spaghetti and a ham sandwich , " Chapman told the boy . " And you 'd better bring two more whiskies . " The bum , his eyes still on Chapman 's face , stretched out a blackened hand and took potato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed it towards him . " That 's right , " he said . He lit a cigarette and smoked , staring past the man , past heads showing over the tops of other booths to where the street lights showed dimly through the cloudy window . The boy brought the order . The bum , after another glance at Chapman , began eating . Chapman smoked , letting his sandwich lie untouched . The most attractive girl . Her name is Ethel Ross .. She said that . It had n't happened then . But she said that . She made it happen . No . She is just a flighty girl . But you are a son of a bitch . A fool , too . You always were a fool . Bob Upchurch said so . Jim , you 've got something like genius , but you sure are a fool . But that was when we were kids , living in that room over on Columbia Heights .. . It 's too late to do anything now . Still , you know where she is . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not goingP117back to Edith . . . Not going back . I 'll write her a letter . No , I 'll have to see her . It 's my fault , Edith . All my fault . But it will be better to break this off now . Better for both of us . My wife .. . Do n't bring me into it , Mister Chapman . Do n't let me stand between you and Ethel .. . Her name is Edith . She wants to get married .. . I do n't blame her , Mister Chapman . You are such an attractive man , and you can be so persuasive when you put your mind on it . Tell her I wo n't put a stone in her way . Not a stone .. . It 's a straw . You talk too much and mix your metaphors . Now , is n't that too bad ! And after fifteen years of associatingwith you ! But I am only an ignorant country girl . . You are selfish and cold-hearted . You never even knew all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I had n't been twenty years old at the time and green as grass I 'd have advised against it . My heart bleeds when I think of the sacrifice . You ought never to have married , Mister Chapman . You ought to have been like that king and had mistresses . You can have a lot now . Ethel wo n't care .. . Her name is Edith . Edith Edith Edith Ross . She wants to get married . I 'm not going to marry her , he thought , surprised . I 'm not going to marry her . The bum speared up the last strip of spaghetti and rolled it about on his fork . Chapman pushed the sandwich towards him . " This Charley , " he said , " is he a bum too ? " PI18 The man shook his head . " They pay him , " he said . " They pay him , but it 's Hans takes up the ashes . Efery morning . At seven o'clock . Two Hundred and One West Eleventh . Hans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's have another drink , " Chapman said . " You 've got a job then ? " he said , when the boy had brought the drinks . " Charley gives you something for taking out the ashes , does n't he ? " " He gifs me bed money efery night , " the bum said , " and he gifs me a quarter . Sometimes he gifs me a quarter . " " You born in Germany ? " Chapman asked . Hofschwengel nodded . " Dusseldorf , " he said . His pale eyes lighted . " But I go to the university at Leipsic . You ever gone to Leipsic ? " " Many times , " Chapman said . " Well , you must have learned a lot at the university . " The man 's glass was at his lips . Over its rim his eyes , grown suddenly intent , sought Chapman 's . " Non vitare , plagas in amoris ne iaciamur . . . " he muttered . His gaze wandered , fixed a point to the right of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitare , plagas in amoris ne iaciamur non ita difficile est quam captum retibus ipsis exire et validos Veneris perrumpere nodos ... " the bum chanted . Chapman laughed , then gazed into the man 's face . " You 're right  --  it 's easier to get into the toils of Venus than to get out , once you 're caught . " He laughed again . " I always preferreda later , even more pagan version of that idea . " P119He rose and , plunging his right hand into his pocket , brought up a handful of change . He stood silent while the man slowly counted the coins , then , suddenly , he set his hand upon the damp , greenish shoulder and leaning so close that he could smell the fellow 's foul breath , recited : " Cras amet qui nunquam amavit quique amavit eras amet . " Hofschwengel blinked . " I do n't understand so good , " he murmured . Chapman laughed . " I never did either , " he said and made his way through the smoky air to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass down and went out into the street . P120AT THE CORNER OF Third Avenue Chapman gave a sleepingtaxi driver the number of his apartment house on East Sixty-fifth Street . The cab moved away under the long shadow of the El . Chapman , watching the black columns flash past , remembered that a woman had once told him that in childbirth she had had a dream of an elevated railway , whose rails , instead of running parallel , diverged . She and her husband , mounting , for a lark , into the little saddlelikecars with which each rail was fitted , had realized only when they came abreast of each other and saw the rails spinning before diem into space , that they were bound for infinity . " Get over on Madison Avenue , " he told the driver . The man crossed over and was starting uptown again . At Forty-fifth Street Chapman called out to him to halt . " I 'll get out here , " he said , and alighted in front of one of the little green hedges , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attempt to re-create for the nostalgic refugee or former expatriate the atmosphere of the Parisian cafe . A man was just disappearing under the red and green checked awning . The figure , glimpsed from the cab window , had seemed , from the gait and swing of the shoulders , to be that of Bob Upchurch . He had not seen Bob for a long time , but earlier in the evening  --  or had it been a day or two ago ?  --  he had been talking about him , with somebody whose identity for the moment eluded him . P12IIt seemed to him that he had to see Upchurch , and , settling his hat more firmly on his head , he strode into the cafe . It was full of people but he did not see Bob or anybody else he knew . He studied the faces around him , then pushed his way to the bar and ordered a double Scotch . The bartender , as he set it before him , leaned forward , pointing . " There 's a gentleman over there wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ware , half rising and beckoning to him . Ed was wedged behind a table in a corner of the room . The man sitting opposite him stood up as Chapman approached . It was Upchurch . Ed was sliding the table out . Chapman slipped behind it and sat down on the red , leather-upholstered bench that ran the length of the wall . " It 's a good thing you brought your drink with you , " Ed said . " Takes pull to get anything here tonight , " and , standing up again , he began to bellow in an anguished tone : " Mike . . . OuAH , Mike ! " The black-haired barman , hanging over another table , inclined his heavy body towards him in the immemorial gesture with which waiters , while remaining motionless , try to convince you that they are flying to do your bidding , at the same time asking indulgence by a levelled forefinger . " Club , with chicken ! " Ed yelled , and , sitting down , picked up his drink . " I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Jim , where you been keeping yourself ? " Chapman , as he was making his way towards them , glass in hand , had lurched , and recovering his balance had realizedthat his head was spinning . He pushed his glass a little way from him and spoke slowly , formally .   " I was in Maine most of the summer . " " Must be fine to be rich , " Ed said . " I 'm telling you , it was a beaut here this summer . " " Did n't you . . . " Chapman began and , pausing , recalled with difficulty the fact that Ed 's wife was named Molly . " Did n't you and  --  Molly get away all summer ? " " Far as Fire Island , " Ed said . " We 're short on the desk now . " Bob Upchurch put out his hand . " How are you , Jim ? " he asked . " I 'm fine , " Chapman said . The disagreeable spinning sensationwas gone , replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete lucidity . He had the impression that he was standing at a little distance from the table and yet his senses registered with unusual precision all that went on . Listening to his own voice it seemed to him that his enunciationhad the roll of drunkenness , so he repeated the words until he succeeded in pleasing this new , critical self . " I 'm fine . Feeling fine . " " You look it , " Ed said with a laugh . The waiter brought Ed 's sandwich and two drinks . Upchurch pushed his away . " I ordered a Tom Collins , " he told the man . Ed was taking his sandwich to pieces , lifting out little pieces of sliced olive with a fork . " I do n't like to eat olives this late at night , " he said . " That your supper ? " Chapman asked . Ed lifted his worn , saturnine , incurably good-humored face . " Sometimes I have a steak , " he said , " but usually this late , I just take a sandwich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time reaching for his glass . Chapman observed that his forehead , even his sunken cheeks were lightly dewed with sweat . Ed went to work at eight o'clock , after an early dinner . At midnight he knocked off to eat this supper and in a little while he would go back to the desk to rewrite late stories that might be telephoned in . He would have another drink , maybe two before he left . He had once told Chapman that there was no use in his abstaining because he was working . " I can write a head just as well drunk or sober , " he had said . Ed came originally from Jessup , Georgia . He had worked on the Atlanta Constitution for ten years and then , still in his twenties , had come to New York . Chapman recalled the day that he had been promoted to a desk on the Globe . " He 'd have been better off if he 'd stayed a leg-man , " he thought and wondered how long it would take the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light film of fatigue which glistened now on his features , like down on the skin of a peach . It would strike deeper all the time , until , filtered through bone and flesh and blood , it solidified , the hard , unyielding core of his being . The waiter brought Upchurch 's Tom Collins . Ed looked at it irritably . " What do you want to drill ( gin for , Bob ? It 'll kill you . " " I got in the habit when I was lecturing this spring , " Bob said . He raised the glass to his lips a moment and set it down . " It 's colorless , " he explained , " and there 's always some Junior Leaguer who 'll slip it into the pitcher for you . " He turned his head to watch some newcomers , revealing a remarkably handsome profile . Chapman stared at him. pI24 When Bob was eighteen he had looked like one of Donatello'sboys . A full-orbed , hazel eye , a high forehead , crowned by sculptural curls , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile , generous mouth . The hazel eyes were the same but the layer of flesh that comes with middle age had somewhat obscured the other features ; the flanges of the nostrils were heavier , the lips thinner , less sensual . He had observed these changes before but tonight it was as if he were seeing them for the first time . It occurred to him that some individuals have their true identity only in youth . All growth , all subsequent change seems to have been made by some disease or disorder of the blood , which subtly alters the features from their true mould . He leaned forward and fixed his blood-shot eyes on Upchurch 's face . " What were you lecturing on ? " he asked . " Some Contemporary Trends in Fiction , ' " Upchurch said . He smiled and , raising his glass , brushed it with his lips and held it out as if for a toast . " Or What Songs the Cash Register Sings . " Chapman , his head a little on one side , seemed to ponder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who every week wrote a critical article for the magazine , Procession , at what seemed to him a fabulous salary , was considered an authority on the contemporary novel . In his youth he had been a poet . In the big room on Columbia Heights that they had shared that last year , he had read poetry to them : his own , his friend 's , Marvell 's , John Donne 's , John Webster 's . He read poetry perhaps as well as it can be read . Syllables , dropped by his clear voice into the smoky air , seemed to be illuminated byP125their own inner meaning . Sometimes the rhythms that had formed in some man 's mind three hundred years ago beat through the open windows out onto the city streets . One night the poet from Ho pushed the door open and taking a folded paper from his mackinaw silently handed it to Bob , and Bob read : Mark how her turning shoulders wind the hours , And hasten while her penniless rich palms Pass superscription of bent foam and wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , death , desire , Close round one instant in one floating flower .. . A fellow named Hart Crane , who worked for an advertising agency by day . His poetry had just become famous when he leaped to death from the stern of a Caribbean steamer . In Italy , from a dirty , three weeks old Times , picked up at a cafe table , he had learned of the suicide and had sent Bob a cable . Bob 's letter was in his room when he got back from the American Express Company . " A good thing , Hart 's death , " he had written . " He was through , and knew it . " But he had taken the title for his own volume of poems from Crane 's work : " This Fabulous Shadow "  --  not the shadow from Plato 's Cave , but Crane 's line , " This fabulous shadow only the sea keeps . " He had used to know most of those thirty poems by heart . Bob 's book had come out in 1930 . There had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Henry Etheridge , had got him the job on Procession next fall . They were still talking about the lecture trip . " . . . I thenpI26 dissected another current favorite . She was a composite personality . At one time we had Charlotte Bronte , Ethel M. Dell , William Makepeace Thackeray and Thomas Nelson Page scattered over the rug .... " Chapman listened , the brooding expression still on his face . It was the voice , he thought . Clear , carrying , wellmodulated , strongly infused with sexuality . When he talked he bent his eyes full upon you and he seemed , if you were talking , to be always on the verge of giving you his swift , flashing smile . Crane , a stubble-haired , pop-eyed fellow , who seemed to live only for poetry and had ended his life when it failed him , had had a jerky , nervous voice and was an insufferable egotist . Bob was too good-looking , too smart , knew his way about in the wilds of New York too well , a rat creeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ padding in winter to the water-rat 's burrow , changes its coat from red to white , so that it may not be seen above the bank . But the trapper , taking hint in the snare , wants only the white , soft fur and , rending the fierce cords , throws the brittle brain-pan , the sanguinary eye , the subtle guts back on to the snow . ... My agent goes ahead . He demands that the stage be draped in black and that wreaths of calla lilies , interspersed with myrtle , be disposed about it at intervals . I am , he explains , in perennial mourning for the printer , Samuel Richardson . The secretary of one club , a very attractive young matron , wanted to know more about the deceased printer whom I mourned , so we went up to my room and were havinga nice talk when the president of the club , Mrs. Horace J. Dellenbraat , appeared , saying that the mayor wanted to seeP127me . I was afraid that I had broken one of the city ordinances but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keys . Very nice fellow . Went to Princeton . We all drove out to his house after dinner and played Monkey Pile . ' . . . " In ancient times , Chapman thought , the wearing of ermine was restricted to royalty . So , a poet might be given to a prince , alternately to pet and to torture , as Torquato Tasso was given by his father to the d'Estes . Nov the mob is privileged of them . " Bob , you do n't read all those books you talk about ? " Ed asked curiously . Upchurch nodded . " It is turning me into a composite personality . I am both Bouvard and Pecuchet . And they are splitting . Bouvard is interested in the historical novel . He read fifteen last month . Pecuchet is for sur-realisme . Takes to Henry Miller . " " If I was going to write a novel , " Ed said , " I 'd take a high class whore-house and I 'd tell the club ladies how the place was run , what kind of soap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they called the girls down . . . I 'd give ' em a few glimpses , of course , enough to make ' em feel they 'd really been there . " Upchurch shook his head . " That was Defoe 's formula . Wo n't work now . You 'd have to put in some chi-chi , not the old gag about how the madam was the best woman in town , but some long , Proustian sentences . Turn her into a seeress . Look up Erskine Caldwell if you 're interested . But I do n't believe you could make it , Ed . You 'd have to be pretty vatic . " He yawned . " If I wrote a novel , " he said , " it would be the life story of the lobster that Gerard de NervalPI28 used to lead around on a string . It neither barked nor bit and knew the deepest secrets of the sea . . . " He looked at Chapman . " Jim , are you writing anything now ? " he asked . Chapman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , had been trying to recall a poem written by the drowned poet . He had got as far asWhere icy and bright dungeons liftOf swimmers their lost morning eyes .. . but an older refrain beat up and submerged the lines . He turned a heavy , melancholy stare on Upchurch . " Perdidi Musam tacendo , " he said , " nec me Apollo respicit . " " He has lost his Muse by being silent , " Ed offered in an appropriately formal tone . " Apollo no longer regards him . " He took a last bite of sandwich . " Never was a boy went to Webb School flunked in his college Latin , " he said . " You know why ? Old Sawney beeched it into us . Let a whole grove of beeches grow up convenient to the house . " He laughed . " Was one old boy named Taylor . Sawney asked him what a taxidermist was . It 's a fellow that collects taxes , ' Taylor told him . Sawney pretty near cut down the whole grove that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle go to Webb ? Sort of wild fellow , named Jack Lewis ? " Chapman did not answer . While Ed was talking he had raised his head to meet Upchurch 's eyes . Through those bright hazel pools curiosity had flickered and then was gone , as swiftly as a trout 's tail lashing through water . " He 's wondering about me , " he thought . Lowering his eyes he drew his glass towards him and drank . PI29Ed picked up his empty glass , looked into the bottom reflectively as though he contemplated ordering another drink , and set it down . " Old Sawney was death on liquor , " he said . " Boys used to bury their jugs in the ground and then suck it up through a straw . . . Got so nobody 'd play footballor baseball . Everybody wanted to play mumble-the-peg . Old Sawney 'd sit over on his porch and watch ' em mumbling the peg and it got him worried . Said it was a good , Christian game but no use being intemperate about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm late , " he said . " Sure has been fine , seeing you fellows . " Upchurch stood up too . As he shook Ed 's hand he laid his other hand on his arm affectionately . " How about having dinner some Thursday ? That 's your night off , is n't it ? " " Tuesday , " Ed said . " I 'll phone you . Hell , I 've lost your number ! " They took little notebooks from their breast pockets and exchanged telephone numbers . When Ed had gone Upchurch turned to Chapman . " How about you coming , too , Jim ? " he asked . " Make it next Tuesday ? " " I 'll come , " Chapman said , " Tuesday or Thursday . " Upchurch laughed . " I 've got to run along , " he said . " Well , good night , Jim . " " Good night , " Chapman said , then suddenly rose and accompanied him . Out on the street Upchurch paused and looked at him uncertainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going downtown , " Chapman said . " Far downtown . " But when Upchurch , with another laugh and a friendly touch on the shoulder , had left him , he did not move but stood , leaning upon his stick , and staring up at the great building whose lighted windows jewelled the dark . The buildings which flanked it on each side were not as tall but every one showed some lighted window . All over the city , people in their cubicles of stone or concrete or steel , lay as tight against one another as bees in their cells of wax , and even beyond the confines of the island the great , crowded ramparts flung themselves on and on until if one travelled far enough one might come to a building whose four walls housed one man and his wife and children . Once , years ago , he had stood in Nimes , gazing up at the wall of the arena , trying to imagine how it had looked when every cranny was inhabited . The Visigoths , demoralized , Romanized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fortified those broken walls and had lived inside them , like modern apartment house dwellers . But they had lived their apian life for a generation only ; when they went back to the land men who had been boys at the time of the exodus went with them , to instruct them in the cultivation of the vine , the care of the flocks . Bees , in their solitary cells , do not control their own destinies . The young grub does not know whether the food discharged to it from the worker 's stomach is the " royal jelly " that will turn it into a queen or the ordinary secretion which fates it to become a drone , which , in the winter , when it no longer has a function to perform , will be cast out of the hive and stung to death . And the queen ? 0 City , preparing for what strange , nuptial flight ! Having stung her sisters to death , she rises on rapid wing , but when the dead bridegroom has dropped from between her feathery legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dying drones . Will not the odor of decay penetrate the royal chamber , interrupting even the processes of fecundation , so that , seeking a cleaner air , she may lead her hive forth in a last flight , in which , travelling high above the orchards and the gardens , they will not stop to cull honey from the apple blossom or the rose , but will continue on , an insensate mass , until , dying , falling in a great cloud , they darken with their wings the whole west ? P132IT WAS ALREADY LIGHT when Edith Ross awoke . Outside , inthe hall , she could hear voices , one muted and thin , the other deep , and then , with an almost imperceptible click the sounds were cut off , as if they had been on a phonograph record . One of the old ladies who lived on the fourth floor was exchanging her morning greeting with Oscar before she started down in the elevator . She closed her eyes . Oscar would not have been on duty last night . His nephew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven . A pimply-faced boy who was still going to high school . She moved over a little , so that the warmth from her companion 's body struck through her thin nightgown into her flesh . 1 1cr eyes still shut , she put her arm about his waist and drew her body up so close to his that her face was pressed against his back . But the fabric of his jacket grew moist where her lips were pressed and the reverberations of her own breathing sounded loud in her ears . She feared that she would wake him and she drew a little away and , lying on her side , stared out into the room . Near the window a man 's dark coat hung on the back of a chair . Beneath the chair a shoe protruded from under a heap of linen and halfway across the room , as if the man had registered his progress by discarding a garment at each step , another shoe lay . Beside the bed , a pair of gray trousers was flung down . A pocket , gaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a five , had spilled out , and lay , flat , gray-green on the floor . She had been asleep last night when the telephone rang , so sound asleep that at first she could not make out what Paul was saying , and then something in the urgent , angry tone in which he repeated the word " gentleman " had disturbedher and she had hung up , telling herself that if it was really she who was wanted he would call again . A few minutes later there had been the click of the elevator and the discreet knock on the door and Jim , obviously drunk , stood there staring at her , with the sharp , pale face showing just behind him . She had thought quickly , stepping past him to smile into the sharp eyes , speaking in a low , companionable voice . " It 's nearly morning , is n't it ? Perhaps we 'd better let him come in . " But it might have been better if she had refused to let him come in , had made Paul take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbance in the hall . Vesta had been right in those cautions she had given her last week . " It does n't pay to be talked about . . . A teacher has to be careful . " Well , suppose Paul did tell his uncle ? What could old Oscar do ? She was a desirable tenant , paid her rent promptly and up till now her behavior had certainly been discreet . But from now on both Paul and Oscar would be watching her , every time Jim came up . She might have to move . . . She would move , at the first sign of impertinence from either of them . Thank God , this was New York and not Waterloo . Jim had been quiet enough after she got the door closed , muttering Latin verses as he bent to take off his shoes , grow- ing irascible only when she mentioned Paul . " I gave him five dollars . Hell , what 's he grousing about ? " It had been said in an unnaturally loud , distinct tone . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his harsh caresses ! ... But that was because he was tight . She had never really seen him tight before . She had been staring through half-closed lashes at the gray-green bill . Five dollars was a lot to give Paul . But a man had to be generous in affairs of this kind .. . She got up abruptly and , slipping on a dressing gown , tiptoedinto the bathroom . A mirror was set into the door . When she had bathed she stood in front of it a moment , studying her tall , white-robed form , then took a comb and ran it through her hair . The dark , springy mass was hardly disturbed by its passage . " I wonder how I 'd look with long hair , " she thought and with her palms pressed her curls down on each side of her temples . But the face , framed between the dark lines of hair , seemed to her at once older and less distinguished and she swept the comb through her curls again , leaving them waving about her forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time of day , flooded with sunshine , it was the pleasantest of her three rooms . She put water on to boil , covered the white , enamelled table with a pale pink cloth , set out cups and saucers and squeezed orange juice into two squat , blue glasses that she had brought from Mexico last summer . The water was boiling . She measured coffee into the drip-pot , then went to the window and examined the plants she had set out in a long , green box a few weeks ago . The ivy had taken root and was grow/ing sturdily but one of the geraniums showed yellowing leaves . She must get Vesta to look at them the next time she came to town . She had " the green thumb . " The most delicatehouse plants throve and even blossomed for her while Edith was always having to replenish her stock from the florist . But that , perhaps , was because Vesta gave them so much time and thought , ascertaining , when she bought a plant , just what fertilizer it needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping her room at a certain temperature for days so that an Amaryllis , for instance , might have all the conditions favorable for blooming . She filled her sprinkling can at the sink and let the tiny jets play on the box until the plants and the earth under them were drenched . Vesta would say that you ought not to water flowers in the morning , especially when the sun was hot as it was today , but she was likely to forget it unless she did it now , and besides , it was pleasant to see the earth turn dark under the water and have the leaves , freed from the gray film that collected on them every night , give off , if only for a few minutes , the warm , green smell of a real flower bed . She set her can on the sill and leaned farther out of the window . Earlier in the morning a sprinkler had passed by . The concrete was still steaming and in one place where the surface was uneven enough water had collected to provide a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew away , leaving a streak of sunlight , opalescent with oil , imprisoned on the bosom of the pool . She stared at it , her brow wrinkling . A phrase from her own thoughts came back to her . " An affair of this kind . " " A hole and corner affair " was what Vesta had called it in that disagreeable con- versation . " Is he going to marry you ? " Vesta had suddenly asked . " You say he and his wife are separated . Is he going to marry you ? " She had been badgered into saying things she had never admitted even to herself . " I do n't know , " she had said . " I do n't know that he wants to marry me . I do n't know that I want to marry him . " " You are n't planning to marry him ! You certainly are a fool , then , to go as far as you 've gone . And you need n't tell me , Edith Ross , that you are n't living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Vesta would be the one to give her away , blurting out some ill-considered statement before one of their friends , and then excusing herself on the ground that there was no use trying to hide things , that everybody knew all about it anyway . Yes , that would probably happen  --  unless they could get married soon ! She had hardly allowed herself to consider the possibility of marrying Chapman before . But , she asked herself now , why not ? his wife had left him . He had told her some months ago that he had not been in love with Catherine for a long time , or she with him , and had said that they would probably be divorced . Catherine  --  she called her that in her thoughts now ; she seemed somehow much nearer now that she had left him than when she was living with him  --  Catherinemust want a divorce or she would not have gone away . And after all , she , Edith , was giving up a great deal for him , risking a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he did n't want to marry her . A breeze came in at the window , rustling some sprays ofp137green in a tall vase . Their elongated shadows , interlaced and quivering , rose from the floor and clambered up the west wall . She felt for a moment as if she were in a wood , with boughs stirring . It would be nice to be in the country today . There was a place in Pennsylvania where she and Chapman sometimes drove for dinner . A two-hundred-year-old stone farm-house , converted into an inn . You dined on a high , walled terrace , above a little stream , flower beds all about . The flag-stone path that meandered through the flower beds went on beside the stream and disappeared into a wood . She had contemplated the vista often without curiosity as she dined on the terrace , but now she found herself wondering what lay farther along the path . She tried to remember what her lover 's engagements were likely to be for the day . If they drove out half an hour before lunch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start out on that path and explore the valley . Or she might pack the lunch herself . There was some cold tongue and lettuce in the refrigerator and a good cheese .. She was investigating her stores when Chapman came in , fully dressed . She hastily took from the oven the toast she had kept warm for him , poured him a cup of coffee and another cup for herself and sat down opposite him . " Do n't you want an egg ? " she asked . He shook his head . He was unnaturally pale and the hollowsaround his lack-lustre eyes were shadowed . As she watched his lips grew tense , drops of sweat suddenly beaded his forehead . He had a hangover . He would not want to talk She sat silent , drinking her coffee and gazing at the floor where the long shadows of the privet leaves still quivered . I " What are you going to do today ? " she asked after a moment . " I do n't know , " he said . " I thought we might go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his empty cup . " If I get as far as Sixty-fifth Street I 'll be lucky . " She got up and poured him another cup of coffee , then , coming up behind his chair , bent swiftly and laid her cheek against his . " Is it very bad ? " she asked . He did not answer until she was back in her seat , then he said , " It 's all right , if I do n't move around . " " You 'd better go in and lie down , " she said in a subdued tone from which the tenderness had suddenly ebbed . As she bent over him she had been struck by the rigidity of his pose . When she had laid her cheek against his he had not moved but had sat rock-like , as if he were only enduring the caress . As if he read her thoughts he spoke , with a laugh . " I must have been pretty well organized when I landed here last night . " " Where were you ? " she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were there . At least I think they were there . " He laughed . " You did n't answer when I called the apartment , around five , " she said . " Were n't you there at all yesterday after-noon ? " " No , " he said . She got up and , moving to the window , straightened the green sprays in the tall crystal vase . Over her shoulder she said , " Jim , I 've been wanting to have a talk with you . " There was a silence ; then he said , " Anything special ? "  | " No . . . That is , nothing new . " She heard the legs of his chair grate on the floor andturned around , her hands thrust behind her , gripping thewindow sill . He was standing up , looking at his watch . " I 've got to be uptown in a few minutes , " he said . " I thought you did n't have any classes today . " " I do n't . But I 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put him off . " " Do n't you think it 's time we talked things over ? " she asked in a low voice . He shot her a wary glance . " Yes , " he said . " Yes , I do . But could n't we do it later ? I 'm due up there at eleven-thirty . " " You do n't have to go . You could put him off . " " I 'd rather not , " he said . He did not meet her eyes as he spoke and he stood stiffly , patient yet poised for flight . " What are we going to do ? " she asked harshly . His eyes rested on her face intently for a moment and then he looked out on to the street . " You know my situation , " he said . " If you gave any thought to mine you would n't come up here at three o'clock in the morning and demand to be let in ... " I was drunk , " he said . " That does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may have to move ... " " I know that , " he said dully . Something hopeless in his expression , his posture , aroused her compassion . She went to him quickly and , hiding her face against his body , put her arms up about his neck . " Do n't let 's quarrel , " she whispered . . He stood motionless , then his arms came up slowly and enclosed her . She felt their light pressure about her . It seemed nerveless , almost mechanical . She took a step backward . His arms fell away . He did not follow her . He spoke . " I 'll call you up . Perhaps we can have dinner together . I 'll call you up . Right after lunch ... " The words rang in his own ears . Too smooth , too rapid , with something at once false and precise about them , they might have been uttered by a robot that he had conjured up , that he had disgorged , to stand there between them . She stared at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to hear through the inhuman sounds other syllables . Suddenly she cried out and her hand went to her mouth and she turned away , her other hand plucking at the air . Shadows of leaves stirred by the sudden movement ran in dapples up her white robe . Her shoulders bent , her hand still pressing her mouth , she stood , remote , lost in the airy thicket . A woman he would never call out to , a thicket he would not enter again . He spoke and afterwards could not remember what he had said before he closed the door and went on his brittle , metallic legs down the hall . P141ON THE TWENTY-SEVENTH of September Willy Lewis lefthome for the first long stay she had ever made in her life , taking with her the red stallion which she expected to show in the two-year-old class at the Fair . She was accompanied by Mr. Shannon , who had volunteered to show the horse for her . That afternoon Catherine drove over to Big Pond , where she found Mrs. Manigault and Miller having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Lewis had left for the Fair . " She got off , " Catherine said . " My God , you should have seen the goings on ! We were all up at the crack of dawn . Aunt Will 's bag was packed . I thought she had nothing to do but get into the car with Mr. Shannon and drive off ; then .1t the last minute she made a tour of the place . There were some pigs I 'd never heard of . Six horrible little spotted pigs off in a pen in the woods . Uncle Joe is laid up and she does n't trust Rodney , so she wanted Maria to promise to feed them herself . And Maria would keep saying how she certainly would like to feed them pigs , but she did n't see how she ( ( mid get to them , with all she had to do . I told Aunt Willy that I would love to slop those pigs , but of course she thought I could n't do it properly . Then at the last minute I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd give her five dollars if she 'd just say she would slop those pigs and let Rodney and me do it . She went into a tail-spin about how she was a member of the Corncob Baptist Church in good standing and could n't tell no lie . All right , ' I says , All right , Maria . I was going to town tomorrow and buy some things to send to Jesse . I was going to send him a big box of chocolate candy and some peanut butter and some sardines , but I 'll be damned if I ever send him another thing , Christmas or no time , if you 're going to act like this . ' Gre't God , Miss Kit , you ought n't to swear like that ! ' she said . But it brought her around . " " You were very clever , " Roy Miller said . " Is this really the first time Miss Willy 's been off the place this year ? " ' " She went to Carthage last spring , to see about the taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call that a pleasure trip . " She looked at Mrs. Manigault . " You know that dark gray shantung of mine ? It fits her perfectly . She wore that , with a little red hat . She looked positively chic ! Cousin Daphne was wonderful . She came in at the last minute and looked her up and down . I was trembling for fear she 'd tell her the suit was too young for her and I did n't know what I could do with Cousin Daphne  --  knock her on the head , I suppose . God knows nobody 'd miss her . But all she said was , Willy , I think I 'd put on a little lip-stick . ' " " Does n't your aunt own a lip-stick ? " Miller asked curiously . Catherine shook her head . " You do n't know my aunt . She 's really right out of Jane Eyre . Green eyes and all . . . . " " And no Mr. Rochester has ever heaved over her horizon ? " " Never  --  as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Miller , settling himself more comfortably among his greenP143and white pillows , gazed out over the lawn where a lone peacockwas wandering and sang : " Plaisir d'amour ne dure qu'un moment , Chagrin d'amour dure toute la vie . .. " He grinned , glancing at Catherine , and repeated the first line of the song . " We dure requ'un moment ' . . . Perhaps she 's just as well off . . . God , Elsie , look at your bird ! " The peacock , as if aware that eyes were upon him , had suddenlywhirled and stood facing them , his splendid tail feathers spread wide , his bronze eye implacably fixing a spot just to the left of the terrace . " What do you suppose he sees ? " Miller murmured . " Aha , it 's love ! " he ejaculated as the peacock , dragging his wings on the ground , advanced a few mincing steps towards a peahenthat had come round the corner of the terrace . Mrs. Manigault had smiled , looking at the peacock , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when poverty or any kind of necessity was mentioned . " If Miss Lewis would get rid of those shiftless Robinson negroes and get one really efficient tenant , she could have an adequate income from that place , " she said . " Tom says the river bottoms are the best in this country . " " But farming is so complicated , " Catherine said . " You have to have the knack of selling as well as producing and Aunt Will completely lacks that . I do n't think , " she added reflectively , " that she could get along without the Robinsons . She depends on Uncle Joe . She even depends on Maria . " " Maria is n't the mammy type , I take it , " Miller said . Catherine laughed . " She 's a good mother to her own chil- dren . Mammy always says that she 's a good neighbor  --  but as for service ! When you get up from one of Maria 's meals you always feel that you 're lucky not to have been poisoned . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if people only had the moral courage to quit putting food into their stomachsthe Lord would solve all problems by taking them away from here . " " A colored Schopenhauer , " Miller said . " Catherine , I do love to hear you talk about Swan Quarter . You 're the only pretty girl I know who can talk just like a book . " Catherine eyed him coldly . " It comes from associating with Jim , " she said . " Is he coming down soon ? " Tom Manigault , in khaki-colored trousers and shirt , carrying a metal part of some machine in his hand , came out of the house on to the terrace . Catherine greeted him before she answered Miller . " In a week or two , " she said , " if he can get away . I 'll have to stay here now till Aunt Will gets back . " Tom sat down , laying the round , cogged wheel on the floor beside his chair . He took a handkerchief from his pocket , wiped a spot of grease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother offered him . " Miss Willy got off ? " he asked . " She and Mr. Shannon drove away at a quarter past seven , " Catherine said . " Tom , she asked me to thank you all again for that horse van . 1 think she might have backed down at the last minute if she had n't seen how luxuriously Red would travel . Mr. Shannon was ecstatic . You know , he 's awfully sweet . You 'd think Red was his own horse .... "   " Marble is rather worried over Red 's prospects , " Mrs. Manigault said . " He thinks Miss Willy might have done better to wait and show him in the three-year-old class . " Tom laughed . " He 's worried over that colt of ours . He hates to see a woman breeder get ahead of him . " " You can hardly say that Miss Lewis bred Red , " Mrs. Manigault said dryly . " He was dropped right here in one of our stalls . I remember the night . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You loused things up . Told that old nigger you did n't have time to fool with the colt and tried to get him to kill him . If you 'd kept your eye on the colt instead of me you 'd have a winner and you might have got rid of some of your troubles too . " " Are you implying that I would be happier if I had allowed you to die of pneumonia ? " Mrs. Manigault asked . " You called the turn , " Tom said cheerfully , " I did n't . " Catherine watched their faces uneasily . She had never been fond of Cousin Elsie . She was too energetic , too dominating , too moneyed for her taste , but of late there was something about her that aroused compassion . She was , after all , getting on in years . She did not stand up well under the attacks that Tom made on her . Sometimes when he had said something particularly shocking she would lower her handsome white head and glance furtively out of the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard him . A moment ago she had looked over at Roy as if she expected him to come to her assistance . And indeed he usually took her side when Tom quarrelled with her . But today he seemed preoccupied , his head half turned away from the company , following with his eyes the movements of a slim , young colored boy who was playing a hose on a brown spot in the lawn . His thoughts , whatever they were , seemed pleasant . He was humming under his breath : ... coulera doucementvers ce ruisseau qui horde la prairie . . . . " " Now what 's the matter with him ? " she thought . She stood up . " I must get back to my responsibilities . Tom , how much corn would you give four-month-old pigs at their night feeding ? Rodney and I disagree . " " Three or four nubbins apiece , " he said absently , and then in a sharper tone : " Are n't those niggers looking after the hogs ? " " I 'm overseeing the job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed them for you , " he said . She shook her head . " No , you wo n't , " she said in a tone that she made more decisive because of the sudden , inquisitive glance that she fancied Miller bent on her . " Indeed , you wo n't , " she repeated . " These are my pigs . " She bent and kissed Mrs. Manigault , kept Miller in his seat with a swift , levelling motion of the hand and turned to the door , but Tom was there before her . " Want to give me a lift down the road ? " he asked . " I 've got some men working in the north field . " " Yes , " she said . When they were outside , in the car , she asked : " Why did you do that ? " " Ask you for a lift ? " She shook her head impatiently . " No . Say you 'd come over and feed the pigs . "  | " Do n't you believe in being neighborly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he had said , pursuing her own train of thought . " They know you never do anything when you can get a nigger to do it for you . They 'll think you 're crazy . " " They know I 'm crazy , " he muttered . " Oh , Tom ! " she exclaimed , and drove more rapidly down the road . When they came opposite a group of men operating a tractor she halted the car . He did not move . She did not seem to notice that he was not getting out , absently following with her eyes the movements of the men and the machine . " Mr. Miller seems in a curious state , " she said at length . " He always is . " " I know . . . But lately . . . Oh , I do n't know . He 's alwaystalking about love . " " He 's been going on about love ever since I can remember . " He laughed . " Reminds me of an old mule we 've got . NothingHenry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Henry 's pawing the ground and hollering loud as any stallion . " " Poor thing , " she said abstractedly . " I suppose it 's on his mind a lot . " " Who ? Henry ? " " Roy , you idiot . Well , there 's nothing he can do about it  --  down here , at any rate . . . . Tom , do you suppose there 's a person like him in the whole of Carthage ? " " Sure , " he said easily . " Did n't you ever see old Mr. Ralph Bateman ? Wears that long black cloak down to his heels and sticks partridge feathers in his hat . They tell me that even some of the niggers are that way these days . I 'd draw the line on that . I would n't have a nigger on my place if I knew he was a fairy . " " That 's absurd , " she said lightly . " They 've got just as much right to vice as we have . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back up . I feel that if a white man 's that way it 's his own business . But a nigger is different . " She turned her head , regarding him with an amused light in her eye . " Tom , you really are wonderful . What I ca n't understand is how you got that way , considering your bringingup . " " I never had much bringing up , " he said . " One summer , when I failed in Latin , they got me a fairy for a tutor . Mother was in Europe that year and Dad was staying in town nights , so Edward and I had the place to ourselves . " " Tom ! He did n't try to corrupt you ? " He shook his head . " He was a pretty good guy . We 'd bone all day  --  he worked the stuffing out of me  --  and then he 'd have a party at night . There was one fellow brought a trunk every time he came out . Used to change his dress two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold wreath on his head one night , and bracelets . " " You mean you were allowed to witness these orgies ? " " Well , in a way . The butler wised me up and I used to pretendI could n't sleep and go down and get him to make me some hot chocolate , and then I 'd stick around in the pantry and we 'd take a look at them every now and then . . . The whole bunch got canned when one of ' em dived into the swimming pool and cracked his skull . It had been emptied , you see , but he did n't know it and took off like a swan , justp149before day-break one morning . It was hard on Edward . The fellow had a fractured skull and sued us for twenty thousand dollars . And of course we maintained that he did n't have any business in the pool , anyway , and Edward countered that his contract permitted him to entertain friends on the grounds . Made quite a stink . " " I should think so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't remember . Mother probably wrote him a cheque . They threw money around like water in those days . " " What a horrible thing to happen . Well , anyhow , they did n't corrupt you . " " No , " he said , his bold eyes roving her face . " No , I 'm not very corrupt . " She laid her hands on the wheel . " I 've got to go . Are n't you getting out here ? " " I 'll go on with you and walk back , " he said . She looked at him steadily . " Do you think that 's a good idea ? " " Why not ? " She shrugged her shouders and started the motor . Neither of them spoke until they had turned off the highway into the lane that ran between Swan Quarter and the Shannon place , when he asked , " Is Chapman coming down ? " " I do n't know whether he is or not . . . I made that up a minute ago . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard from him ? " " I had a letter last week . " " What did he say ? " " He said that it was very hot in New York . . . Oh , Tom , I do n't want to talk about it . "  | " I know I have n't any business asking you questions , " he said . She laid her hand on his arm . " Tom , I 'm so fond of you . I wish you had n't taken this notion into your head . " " You mean wanting to marry you ? " " You ca n't marry me , " she said impatiently . " I 'm already married . " " I do n't expect to marry you next week or next month , " he said , " but it 's pretty plain that you and Chapman are oil the rocks . You are , are n't you ? " " Yes , " she said in a low voice , " but I do n't want to talk about it . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took hold of the wheel and began turning the car off on to a wagon road that led through the woods . She shook her head , smiling and keeping hold of the wheel . " Tom , I was awfully upset last week . I hardly knew what I was doing . I was very unfair to you , very inconsiderate ... " He squared around so that he could look down into her eyes . He laughed . " You mean letting me make love to you ? I do n't think you were inconsiderate . I think you were sweet . " He suddenly slid both arms around her and gripped the wheel . She resisted for a moment , then let him guide the car off the lane into the narrow , rutted road . When they were out of sight from the lane he halted the car and quickly got out . As she descended he caught her in his arms and held her to him for a moment , murmuring her name . She slipped away from him , flushed and shaking her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path up to the spring . Halfway up the slope she stopped and sat down on a rock . He remained standing beside her , looking down into the ravine . " Miss Willy ought to sell some of that white oak , " he said . He pointed to an oak whose boughs towered above the rest . " That tree 's ready to be cut now . In a year or two it 'll start rotting . " " I do n't believe she 'd do it , " she said . " She has a horror of cutting down the woods . They were always rowing over that when Uncle Jack was alive . " " She does n't need to cut down the woods , " he said , " just take out the trees that need cutting . There must be a dozen of those white oaks in here . Joe Applegate 'd move in here for that much . " " You mean set up a saw-mill in here ? " " Sure . . . But I would n't trust Joe to pick the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mill was running . " " She could n't do that . And she would n't have any idea which trees ought to be cut . " " I could go through the woods and mark them for her . And I could keep an eye on Joe too . " " Would you do that ? " she asked eagerly . " Would you do that for her , Tom ? " " Sure , " he said . He turned around , grinning . " You do n't know what a good neighbor I am. " : ; he smiled at him , thinking that it was true . He had a really good heart . " You like to live down here , do n't you ? " she asked . " I would n't live anywhere else now , " he said . " You know , i there 's a stretch in November , after the leaves have turned when it 's mighty fine down here . You get up early in the morning and ride out over the place . . . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kit . I 've got a little gun that 'll just suit you ... " She shook her head . " I ca n't bear to shoot things . " " You 'll get over that . " She stood up suddenly . " Look ! " she said and pointed to something shining at the foot of the path . " Did you drop something ? " he asked . " I 'll get it . " But she was already at the foot of the path , stooping . She held the object up for him to see : a round silver box with chased edges . She thrust her hand into the pocket of her jacket ; there was a slit in the lining . " It 's a wonder I ever found it , " she said . They climbed the slope again and sat down on the rock . They sat in silence . Presently he took the box from her , lifted the lid and , finding that it contained nothing but a few grains of powder and a puff , handed it back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in it , " he said . " No , " she murmured , " just my complexion . " She continued to hold the box in her hand , turning it this way and that so that the rounded surface caught the light . The decorative border was darker than the rest of the lid . It 's dirty , she thought , I must polish it , and she bent her head to examine the chasings . She had had the box three years but until this moment she had not realized that the design was sheaves of wheat interspersed with some round fruit . I never liked it , she thought . That 's why I never really looked at it before . P153Jim had bought it for her on her thirty-second birthday . When he gave it to her she had been surprised , for he was not the kind of man who made presents . Once , before they were married , walking on Madison Avenue , they had passed a florist 's shop and he had broken from her side with a grunt and disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at an unattractive bouquet of red roses and yellow snapdragons . A huge sheaf of the same roses and snapdragons had been delivered to her a few hours later . But he must never have passed a florist shop again during their courtship , for no more flowers had arrived , and she could not remember any other present he had ever made her . The compact had been Molly Ware 's idea . It would have been better if she had gone with him to select it . They had sold him this preposterous little number that was all looks and had no room in it for either lipstick or rouge . Tom Manigault stood up . " I 'd better be getting back , " he said . She stood up too . He did not go immediately but stood before her , not saying anything , but keeping his eyes fastened on her face . His mute look said that there was no necessity for his leaving , no concern of his own called him from her side . It was merely that he found it too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surcease for a time from his own violent emotions . A love affair , she thought , if it got anywhereat all , always reached that stage with such alarming rapidity . She stepped past him . Her hand , going down into hercket , touched the little silver box . " I could fling it outow , " she thought , " fling it out and let it tarnish hereunder the leaves . " Her hand closed on the box . She startedP154down the path . Tom followed . He had accepted her rebuff quietly but tomorrow or the next day he would renew the attack . Three weeks ago he had begun to make love to her . Sometimes she rebuked him as she had just done . Sometimes she listened to the pictures of the life they could have together , if , as she sometimes put it to him , laughing , she would only start for Reno in the next half hour . His mother could keep the big house , he said , and he would build a house for them on the other end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Would she like to raise horses ? He knew where he could lay his hands on a good brood mare . A High Cloud colt . If she would say the word he would buy the mare now . She could breed her before she went to Reno . Have a colt waiting for her when she got back . " Shut up , Tom , " she had said , " you 're indecent , " but she had listened to him and would listen again . There was a fascinationin it , like getting steamship folders and planning the details of a trip you knew you would never make . And there was relief , too . If there came a time when you could not bear this life that you had , it seemed that you might escape to another life . P155AT HALF PAST SEVEN Maria entered the cabin . Old Joe was lying flat on his back . He raised himself with a groan and , doubling up one of his pillows , propped himself against it . " You need n't be settin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maria said . He sighed contentedly . " I reckon I got something , " he said . " Ai n't never been a night they did n't send me some-thing . " " War' n't much supper tonight , " Maria told him . " Least nothing you 'd eat . But I got you some snaps here . And Miss Kit sont you some cheese . " She went to the iron kettle which sat on the hearth and ladled some snap beans and a strip of salt pork on to the plate she had brought from the house . Joe rested the plate on his hunched-up knees . He took a bite of the cheese before he ate any of the pork or beans . " Jesse goin ' to relish this , " he said . " She got the box off , did n't she ? " " Was some of that cheese , " Maria said , " and cakes ; what they call Fig Newtons . And some chocolate cakes , too , with king . And a box of candy . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the hearth and sat down . The fire that she kept burning there at all seasons of the year smouldered dimly through ashes . She drew the ashes away with a poker and , taking up a turkey wing fanned the embers until they glowed , then laid some chips on top of them and , leading back in her chair , stared into the rising flames .   Joe had finished his supper . " Here , woman ! " he called sharply . She rose and took the plate and knife and fork from him , washed and dried them and resumed her seat . He remained propped on his pillows , surveying the room , lit now by the dancing flames . He ran his tongue over his lips , then wiped them on the back of his hand . " I reckon she 'll send some sardines next time , " he said . " May not be no next time , " Maria said . Joe was silent . " You slop them hogs ? " he asked suddenly . " Miss Kit 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and Rodney . " Joe laughed . " Miss Kit 's just like Miss Agnes . Likes to be around stock . Miss Agnes used to go with me to feed the stock when she was so little she could n't hardly get through the grass . And after she 's grown she used to pick her out a calf every year and shell corn for it herself . . . Got out in the lot once when I was butchering . Had my maul raised to fell a steer and here comes Miss Agnes . I 'll kill you , Uncle Joe ! ' she says and she bit me on the hand till I had to drop my maul . I told Mister Jack , I says , I can butcher anything on this place you want butchered , but how anybody going to butcher with Miss Agnes swarming up ' em like a weasel ? ' Mister Jack , he told me to put away my maul , said we would n't butcher nothing else that day . And he sont that steer off the place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " He did n't have no right to do that . " " He paid me for it , " Joe said . " One thing about Mister Jack , he war' n't chinchy . " " He war' n't chinchy , " Maria said , " but he was drunkp157more'n half the time . White folks take a drink , it ai n't nothing . But let a nigger get one too many . . . " She sighed . " Well , he 's dead now , and underground . " " I wish he war' n't , " Joe said . " I could always git along with Mister Jack . " " You could always git along with any of ' em . " " It ai n't hard to git along with Old Miss , " Joe said . " All you got to do is git her in the lead and keep her there . Trouble with you , you want to stay in the lead yourself . " Maria did not answer . " Fill me my pipe , " Joe said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mantel and , pulling off part of a leaf , crumbled it in her hand , filled the bowl of the corn-cob pipe , then crouching on the hearth , dexterously picked up a live coal and lit the pipe and drew on it a few seconds before she took it to him . When she handed him the pipe she looked down at the pillows wadded behind his back . The slips were dingy . They should have been changed this morning . But she would not disturb him now . Her eyes sought the far corner of the room where the bolster lay across a trunk . The sham which coveredit was ornamented with huge purple morning glories and trailing green vines . She remembered the day she finishedworking those morning glories . She could hardly wait until she got the bed made up , with the blue-and-white quilt , the huge pillows and finally , on top of all , the bolster . I'lie morning glories had stood out as bright as real flowers , so pretty with the green leaves all around them . She had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the cabin to have a look at them . That thread had n't faded in all the washings it had had ; the colors of the morning glories were just as bright , the cloth itself still spotless , but she took no pleasure in the sham now , would just as soon have had any old rag on the bed . She went back to the fire . The hand of tobacco was still lying on the table . She broke off half of a leaf and , stuffing it into her mouth , chewed slowly . " Miss Kit say anything about leaving ? " Joe asked . She shook her head . " She do n't say nothing to me and I do n't say nothing much to her . . . She 's carrying on with Mister Tom Manigault . Least I see ' em meeting off in the woods . " " Maria ! " Joe said with sudden energy . " There 's some of the folks over at the church would n't think as much of you as they do if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white folks go off walking in the woods it do n't mean the same as it does with niggers . " Maria was silent , chewing and looking into the flames . The nicotine was having its effect . Her mind was as clear as a bell now , but in a few minutes it would be even clearer . In a few minutes it would be like she was n't in this room . She glanced at Joe , still propped on his pillows , smoking quietly . Standing there beside him , she had looked down and had seen the top of his head all white . It had not been like that last year . Those groans and grunts were n't all for his rheumatism . He was breaking fast . He had had enough to break him . In a few years he would be past work and they would have to go to town , to live with Elvira and her husband . Joe kept thinking that Miss Willy would get on her feet , that tobacco would get high again and it would be likeP159it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care of their hands when they got past work . But things never would be that way again , and even if they were , Miss Willy would n't catch up . There was hardly enough for her and the old lady now . She could n't take care of two old people who were past work . They would have to go to town . She herselfdid n't care now where they lived . But it would be hard on Joe , to live where he could n't even have a hog or a garden spot , and to have to depend on Elvira . They had never gotten along , and as for Elvira 's husband nobody could get along with him . The roistering kind who 'd sell the legs out from under the table to get a drink . . . She wished that she had n't said that about Miss Kit meeting Mr. Manigault off in the woods . There was no use in telling everything you knew , especially if you knew more than other people . She tilted her head slightly , gazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door stood up lightly , its branches spread like arms . If she turned her head now and looked behind her the room would seem different from the way it had a moment ago . Everything would stand out clean and light , as if it could move around by itself . That was always the sign , when things got that airy look . It did n't happen every time she chewed tobacco . In between times she would forget , and then all of a sudden , she would get the sign and know that for a few minutes , anyhow , she would have a little ease , the only ease she ever got . She could bear to think about anything then . It was strange about Elvira 's husband . He had been drunk off and on since he was fourteen years old , hardly ever did a day 's work and was roguish to boot . And yet he had a good It was the next afternoon that Mister Jack had been killed , his neck broken when he fell from a wild horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe came running . " His neck ? " she cried . " It ai n't his neck ! " But the doctor was there by that time . He said that his neck was broken the minute he hit the ground , quicker even than a razor could have cut it .. . She did not tell Joe that she had wished Mister Jack 's death on him . He was nearly out of his head as it was . But she never had anything in mind but to confess , to stand up in church before everybody and confess . But meeting did n't start at Concord for two weeks . And by that time she had got used to the thought of her sin . She had never confessed , had never told anybody ; she had just got used to it . There were times when she would n't want to give it up . It made her feel closer to Jesse . They had both killed , only she had meant to , and he had n't . She knew he had n't . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a little boy . he had had typhoid fever when he was seven years old . That was why he was so late getting into the field . She had had to keep him around the house longer than the other children . And he thought more of her than the other children did , seemed somehow to have more love in him . That year that Miss Kit had had a woman from Big Pond cooking for her she and Jesse had been here in the cabin together all day long . He liked to sort quilt scraps and sometimes he would twist them into pretty flowers . When she fetched water from the spring he went with her and , coming back , would bring as full a bucket as she would let him . " What you going to do with all this water , Mammy ? " . . . " Wash the white folks ' P163clothes . " He stood there on the path and looked down at the house . " When I get big I ai n't going to let you wash their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had n't taken to playing the banjo it would not have happened . He could play better than any of them and they made him play for the dances . Somebody always brought a jug . Some men could drink whiskey and lie down and sleep it off . But Jesse was high strung . Let him get a drink in him and he did n't know what he was doing . . . Ought a man to be punished when he did n't even know he was doing wrong ? She drew a long , shuddering breath , then glanced behind her in alarm . But Joe was sleeping , prone under the covers . She got up and went to the door . Mist was rising from the creek . The lights from the house showed through it dimly . When she left the house they were all sitting on the porch , but now lights showed in young Miss Kit 's and Miss Daphne 's rooms . The downstairs bedroom was dark . Old Miss must be in bed . Young Miss Kit was trying to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how hard she tried she did n't please the old lady . She was used to Miss Willy , who would lie down and let her walk over her a dozen times a day . But no matter how much Miss Willy did for her the old lady would never think as much of her as she had of Mister Jack . If it had n't been for old Miss Kit she would have confessedand been rid of her sin . She had sent for her right after Mister Jack was killed . She did n't want to go , but Joe made her . " Go on , woman . Go on . You got to go ! " . . . Miss Kit was in her room , by herself , trying to take off her clothes , but her fingers would n't serve her and her legs gave way and she almost fell , stumbling to the bed . " I feel so weak , Maria . . . " " You be better in a minute . . . " She had coveredher up and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman but a wild thing , roaming the woods and shrieking its grief into the night . Kinfolks had come to look after Miss Willy . She had stayed with the old lady , steeping cloths in water and vinegar and laying them on her forehead . Miss Kit would let the cloth stay on for awhile and then it would come over her again that he was dead and she would rise up , moaning . Towards morning she fell asleep . She herself was dozing in her chair when the old lady woke her , saying in a quiet voice , " Maria , has anything happened to Jack ? " " He 's dead , " she said , " killed , falling off his horse . " Miss Kit had got up out of bed and started across the room . Her nightgown was open down to her waist . Her breasts were showing . But she did n't care , running to the window and then to the door and all the time shrieking . They came and gave her some medicine the doctor had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when your hand closes over its throat , before you wring its neck . But you could still hear it in the room . And all the next day out in the cabin she could hear it . She called it up now sometimes when she wanted ease . She stared up at the watery sky . Mister Jack was dead , and buried over there on the hill . And Jesse was behind bars . She would never confess while Miss Kit had breath in her body . I 'll keep her crying out , she said , crying out for both of them . P165AFTER SUPPER they sat on the porch , but at half past seven the old lady rose to go to her room . Catherine went with her to help her undress . Daphne hesitated , looking out over the lawn , where fire-flies were already flitting . " I think I 'll take a turn in the woods , " she said . " It wo n't be dark for an hour yet . " Catherine said , " Cousin Daphne , mushrooms must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up hope ! ' " Daphne shook her head . " I 've just thought of a place where there might be some Russulae . I 've about got time to make it before dark . " She went upstairs and got her basket and knife and set out for the woods . Catherine was right , she thought . Of all the hobbies she had ever had mycology was the most rewarding  --  itwas a hobby , of course , not a passion ; Catherine had an exaggerated way of speaking  --  but it was better than Italian cut-work or burning designs in leather as she used to do in her young days , better , even , than knitting . One never knew what a day would bring . If one were indefatigableand resourceful , as she was , one need never give up hope . Now for a week she had roamed the woods , finding nothing but one good-sized " Bear 's Head , " growing out of the trunk of a tree , and then , a minute ago she had thought of a place that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the graveyard . A little stream ran through it . Its  | banks were covered with moss : the kind of place that Russulae loved . She arrived at the edge of the woods , hesitated , then struck north . A few minutes ' walk brought her to the bed of the ravine . The stream was low , hardly more than a trickle of water , but the mossy banks were spongy with moisture and even the dead leaves on the slope were damp . A path ran beside the stream . She walked along it slowly , bending a sharp eye on the moss . As a child she had come here , with Agnes Lewis  --  they had had a playhouse in a cave up the slope and dug moss from beside the stream to decorate it . There had been mushrooms growing here then , tiny , scarlet trumpets nestling in the moss , stouter mushrooms of a deeper scarlet , thrusting up through the dead leaves . But they had believed that all mushrooms were poison and had paid no attention to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mushroom that they had found , standing six or seven inches high on its slender , hollow stalk . They had admired its pale brown top , ornamented with deeper brown spots and had thought that the under-side looked exactly like cream-colored , accordion-plaited silk . Agnes , in spite of all she could say about its being poisonous , had carried the mushroom up to the cave on the hill , to be her lady 's " parasol . " The Lepiota procera or Parasol mushroom . What would Agnes say if she knew that she was huntinga mess now for her dinner ? She found a lettuce-like Sparassis crispa growing beside a tree trunk , desiccated but a splendid specimen . A little fartheron was a cluster of green Russulae . Some of them wereP167showing signs of decay but four were in their prime , firm and meaty , each as big around as a coffee cup . She plucked them and as she straightened up glanced at the sky , showing gray through the interlacing twigs . She ought to be turning back . It would be dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she might come on more Russulae . It would be a satisfaction to have enough for a mess . They had eaten the last of the Bear 's Head at supper . Ahead the trunk of a sycamore glimmered . There was a little pool between its arching roots . It was there that they used to come to wash their " dishes , " pieces of broken china or glass that they had brought from the house , or brightcoloredpebbles that they found in the bed of the stream . In those days there had been a path going up to the cave but it was obliterated now . She stood beside the sycamore , staring down into the dark water . She remembered the day that Agnes had said that they would have a playhouse and had led her up the slope to the cave . It was a rock-house , really , for there was no passage into the earth . But the overhanging slab was as wide as the roof of Maria 's cabin , the rocks that formed the walls were half as high , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll put a rock wall down the middle , " Agnes said , " and you can have half and I 'll have half . " They had toiled all day , erecting the rock wall , and then had set about devising furniture for the house : benches made of flat rocks , supported on smaller rocks , wider slabs of rock , covered with moss " mattresses " for beds , little moss rugs scattered over the white floor . There was blue clay on the banks of the stream . They had made their " people " out of that . Small , shining pebbles for eyes , moss garments , cheeks colored red with pokeberry juice . If you sprinkled the figures lightly with water the clay women  --  they had not bothered to make any men  --  would not crumble but stayed intact for days . She set her basket down and started up the slope . In one place some trees had been felled and a kudzu vine sprawled over the stumps in a great tangle . Beyond the vines shadows were massed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tangle , climbed over a heap of rocks and stood in front of the cave . It was smaller than she remembered it and the shadows were so deep that she could hardly tell the rocks from the bushes . But the sand that still covered the bed of the cave gleamed white . There was a dark line running down its middle . She stooped and felt stone cold under her hand . Those old rocks that had made their dividing line were still there . She let her hand brush over them , feeling the edges rough under her fingers , and turned and stumbled down the hill . She had set her basket against the trunk of the sycamore or she might not have found it , darkness was falling so fast . She hurried along the path , one arm crooked in front of her , protecting her face from the bushes . Ahead the path was white ; mist was rising from the branch . She had not been this way in thirty years . Not since that summer . It must have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agnes had been a strange girl , large for her age , quiet among the grown people . She would sit in the house and sew and talk with them as if she were grown , too , and then suddenly slip back into childhood , have a spell of playingpaper dolls or make up some Indian game . She herselfP169still had all those paper dolls they used to play with . The Bascomb girls ' paper dolls were all named Mrs. Bascomb or Mrs. Lewis or Mrs. Manigault , but Agnes would take some pretty , rosy cheeked creature out of The Designer and turn her into Fair Rosamond or Eleanor of Aquitaine . In those days , all the children visited at Swan Quarter in the summers ; she , Daphne , had been Agnes ' favorite . That was because she had imagination . Agnes knew that if she thought of anything interesting to do she would follow her while the Bascomb girls were wondering whether they would get their feet wet . There had been one summer when she and Agnes divided the woods between them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peace Tree , " surrounded by their retinues . . . But the rock-house had been the best secret they ever shared . There was something mysterious about the place that brought them back to it day after day . There was always something new to do : moss mattresses to arrange on the beds , the clay people 's cheeks to be colored . They had played there a week and then she had had to go into Carthage to visit  --  she and her mother used to leave their Nashville boarding house in June and spend the summer making the rounds of the relatives  --  and had spent two weeks at Uncle Will Morton 's ; there were no children , and the yard was no bigger than a pocket-handkerchief . All the time she had been longing for Swan Quarter . And then one afternoon the Bascombs had come by in their surrey and they had all driven out to Swan Quarter . There was company there before them : the Beckmans from the next farm . Water-melons had been brought out and were being eaten on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could give the Bascombs the slip  --    she wanted to go to the rock-house  --  but Agnes only smiled uncertainly and a minute later when Tom Beekman came up she moved with him to the end of the lawn . The other young people followed them  --  there was a rope swing hung from the limb of a big oak . She had not gone with them , even when Cousin Kit came up behind her and gave her a push , but had sat there on the red bench , and watched Agnes get into the swing , knowing , even before Agnes soared up into the air , laughing , her skirts fluttering about her legs , that it was all over and Agnes gone from her , into another world . Afterwards she had had moments of rebellion , moments , even of hope . She had thought that Agnes would get tired of having beaux and come back to her . There had been nights when she lay awake , praying that she would . But deep insideshe had known that it would not happen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that childish griefs were soon cured . She could not ever remember having experienced a greater sense of desolation . And why not , she asked herself , bringing her arm up savagely to brush a cobwebfrom her face . Why not ? It was the last time in my life that I was ever happy . She emerged from the wood and came in sight of the house . The lower part yawned as black as the cave on the hill . The old lady was evidently in bed . But a light burned in Catherine 's room . If Willy had been there a lamp would have been left burning on the table in the front hall , but Catherine , of course , would never think of that . She crossed the porch , stumbling against a rocker , slipped through the door , locking it behind her , and went up the stairs  |p171Light  , showing in a slit under Catherine 's door , cast a faint glow into her own room . She made her way to the bed-side table found a match and lighted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key in the lock . When she had undressed and had put her red flannelette robe on over her nightgown , she laid her specimens out on the table . The green Russulae she placed on the window sill . They ought to have gone into the ice-box but she did not feel like going downstairs again and it was cool enough in here . They would do just as well on the sill . She opened her notebook  --  itsgray cover was ornamented with neat red lettering : " An Encheiridion of Wood and Field Mushrooms , by Daphne Passavant "  --  numbered a page and wrote , " Sparassis crispa ( Herbstii ) . " She examined the Crispa through her magnifying glass . Even when its petals were desiccated they retained their original texture , gelatinous and at the same time firm . The color did not change , either . But how to describe that color , which was neither gray , nor green , nor yellow , but some unnamed color , a color a plant might develop growing in an underground cavern , or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find the word for that smooth , gray-green-yellow . She remembered the first mushroom she had ever plucked . She had been walking in Centennial Park in Nashville , with Mrs. Mayhew . They had walked up over a rise and suddenly a yellow flame had seemed to sweep over the grass : half a dozen clusters of Clitocybe illudens , growing at the foot of an oak . " Look at those things ! " Charlotte had said and they had gone over and stood looking down at them . They were as large as calla lilies , pure yellow , shaded with scarlet . If you got an Illudens at a certain stage and put it in a dark room , it glowed . And in the daylight that incandescence seemed to linger in the petals . They were so beautiful that she stooped and picked a cluster . Mrs. Mayhew touched one with her finger , then took it away quickly . " It feels clammy , " she said . " It feels like dead people . " And from that day forward she would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlotte Mayhew had been dead herself for ten years . She never thought of her as dead , but as sitting in the blue shell chair in the sitting room of the boarding house on West End Avenue . It was the only really comfortable chair in the room but nobody else would have thought of taking it . It was always left free until Charlotte , having given her orders for the next day , and having conferred with Uncle Will  --  she never could have run that boarding house without that old ncgro man  --  swept into the living room where the boarders who had nothing else to do were congregated . She would have stopped in her bedroom to touch up her hair and face  --  sometimes she even changed her dress  --  but she never joined old Mrs. Trabue and Mrs. Sloane and Mrs. Sawyer at their bridge , but would sit and look on . Sometimesshe would roam about the room , straightening a pictureor looking out of the window or turning the radio on too loud . If you were playing cards you might glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at you . She would be smiling , as if there were somethinginnately ridiculous about you and she would notP173change her expression but would broaden her smile , as if inviting you to laugh at yourself . Or she would tap a card with a red , pointed nail . Play the queen , Daphne ! Play the queen and see what happens , and then you would have to try to finesse your queen , even though you had decided that it could n't be done . People who had known Charlotte all her life said that when she was a young girl she had not had that streak of malice in her nature . No doubt her hard life had brought it out in her . It is no joke to be left a widow , penniless , and with three children . She had no education , no particular talents . There was nothing for her to do but open a boarding house . But she had never made any secret of her hatred of it . Old Mrs. Trabue had told her , Daphne , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear sitting at a table where the hostess was so indifferently amiable ; she was afraid that the food would disagree with her . She had reported that to Charlotte , out of the kindest intentions , hoping that she might be induced to change her manner . But Charlotte had only laughed . It was Charlotte who had introduced her to her husband , calling out as she passed the parlor , " Why , there she is now. ! " She would have gone on past that day but Charlotte had made her come into the room where he stood in front of the mantel . " Mr. Storrs is Mrs. Trabue 's nephew . But we are n't going to tell her he 's here till supper time . . . . Her heart 's weak . " He had given Charlotte a quick look and then they were both laughing . A few minutes later Charlotte left the room , saying she had to see the cook . She herself had been about to get up and leave when he walked over and sat down beside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coarse , pitted skin and the kindest gray eyes . " Mrs. Mayhew tells me you spend a month with her every summer . She seems to have a very select place . . . " " Yes , " she said and in her embarrassment could not keep her voice from shaking . " The boarders are all , very nice . " And then Charlotte came back and made a fuss over her tan shoes that she was wearing for the first time that day . " I declare , Daphne , you always get the best looking shoes , " and he looked at the shoes and then up at her , smiling . " They are pretty , " he said . She had wondered then . Why was he troubling to be so amiable ? What did he care about her shoes ? She had thought that perhaps being lame made him kind , but his limp was very slight . Charlotte said that he had got it falling down a flight of stairs when he was drunk . " It 's the last touch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At supper that night he sat next to Charlotte and after supper he played bridge with Mrs. Trabue and Mrs. Sloane and Emmic Ronald . Mrs. Trabue had not seemed glad to see him . She was more exacting than usual that evening and the game broke up early . She and the Rollins girls had gone out on the porch to get cool . When the game was over he came out , stood in the doorway a minute and came right over and sat down beside her . The Rollins girls went inside after a little but he had sat on . He said that the boarding house seemed a strange setting for her . She had got her breath back by that time and asked , " Why ? " sharply . " I do n't know , " he said and laughed . " Perhaps I should n't have said that . After all , I do n't know you very well . "  |p175The  next day she went to Charlotte and asked her what she had told Mrs. Trabue 's nephew about her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are General Sumner Wood 's granddaughter and play the piano better than anybody in the house . You are n't ashamed of your grandfather , are you ? " And then she had burst out laughing . " You ca n't blame me , Daphne , if he is smitten by your charms . " When she met him in the hall the next day he stopped her , as excited as a little boy , and told her that his aunt had made him a present of two hundred dollars . " It will come in handy , " he said . " My little girl 's birthday is next week . " He was forty-five years old , though he looked younger , and had been divorced from his wife for three years . " The only thing I mind is not seeing the children . I 'm allowed to have them with me for two weeks each year . But that does n't do me much good . A newspaper man ca n't take care of two little girls ... " She had left the boarding house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her cousins , the Bells . He had followedher there . The job he had been about to take in Nashvillehad n't panned out . " They want a copywriter and I 'm a layout man , and besides , " he said , smiling , " I like the mountains . " He had stayed at the Signal Mountain Inn and had come down to see her every night . She knew that the Bells were talking . But she did n't care . Through all his courtship that was not what had worried her . It was the other thing , for she had known all along . At every move she had thought , This is not the way things happen . But he was there , bringing her flowers , candy , the fitted bag that she had thrown out of the street-car window on her way down the mountain . . .  | And the things he had said to her , not his declarations of love , but the little things he had let drop in that low , deprecatoryvoice . People thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she married him . But he had told her everything , even what his wife had said when they were divorced . " She 's right . I 'm not any good , " and when she had argued that he was , " No . I never will amount to anything . ... I ought to have met you earlier . " They were married in August . When she asked him where they should go on their wedding journey he said that he did not want to leave the mountains , and wished that she would simply join him at the inn . . . The wedding reception  --  the house had been heavy with the fragrance of Madonna lilies  --  was not over till six o'clock . It was dark when they arrived at the inn . As they went up to their suite they passed people coming down to dinner . It was one of the best suites in the hotel : a bedroom , a bath and a large sitting room , facing the Point . While he was tipping the boy she went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city were coming out , one by one , like the fire-flies now on this lawn . The boy left . She heard Richard 's quick , limping step , heard him open and shut a dresser drawer and then the creak of the bed as he sat down . She did not turn around but stood gazing at the lights . But her breath was coming fast and even now when she thought about that time it was as if she held a fiery coal in the palm of each hand . For the had forgotten what she had always known , had believed that she was loved , had almost feared to turn around because now there was no barrier between her and the passion he had professed . And then he had come up and put his arm about her and said that he must trouble her for a loan . He was laughingp177and his face wore the half-tender , half-mocking expression it wore when he spoke of his wife and children . She had not understood .

It was as if somebody else , somebody like Charlotte Mayhew , were in the room , laughing with him . " You do n't understand , darling , " he said , " I ca n't write a cheque . " His arm tightened about her shoulders . " Aunt Bessie 's two hundredjust got us up here , " he said , and took her chin in his hand and turned her face so that he could look into her eyes . " It was pretty bad of me , I know , " he said and laughed a little . . . She remembered making a little mewing sound , looking past him , wondering whether her legs would bear her as far as the bed . She sat down on its edge before she spoke . " I have n't got but twenty-five dollars . I spent it all on clothes . It was foolish of me . " He looked at her intently then . " You could raise some money , though ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't but seventy-five dollars a month . I get it four times a year . " He said , " Seventy-five dollars a month ! " and then he laughed again and said something she had never rightly understood . " Seventy-five dollars a month ! " he said . " That little hussy ! " " I could try , " she said . " I never asked them to advance me any money before . It 's Hollins and Slaughter take care of it for me . I could try . " His eyes had a bright , absent stare . " I would n't bother , " he said . " We 'll get along . " He walked to the dresser , picked up one of the brushes he had laid out , ran it over his hair , and re-tied his tie . " I would n't bother , " he said again in thatP178strange , thoughtful tone and got his hat and moved to the door . He paused there , his hand on the knob . " I 've just thought of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , closing the door behind him . She waited until midnight . When he did not come then she went down and told the clerk . Afterwards , when she would lie awake , while the events of that night passed before her like a cinema , she could see that the clerk had repressed a smile as he carefully noted down the name : Richard Storrs . But at the time she did not notice the smile . Two or three times that night she went out of the side door of the hotel and walked about in the grounds . Beyond the smooth lawns , off towards the Point , there was a tangle of wild growth . She had had the delusion that he was wandering there , had kept thinking how a desperate man might plunge off those flat , tilting rocks two thousand feet down into the valley ... . He must even then have been on the train for Atlanta ... . From the next room came the sound of a foot on the floor , a chair pushed back sharply .

Perhaps they had quarrelled . Catherine was carrying on now with Tom Manigault . Perhaps she had carried on with other men in New York and Jim Chapman had put his foot down . That was probably the reason she had come down here . The noises had ceased . " How quiet it is now , ' she thought . " But then it always is quiet here . " She went to the window . Maria 's cabin was dark . Negroes went to bed with theP179chickens . The new moon , tangled in the boughs of the sycamoretree , shone , even through the fog . They say it is bad luck to look at the new moon through the boughs of a tree . But I have never had any luck but bad , she thought . . . . I ought not to have thought of those old times .

P180AFTER CATHERINE had helped her grandmother undress andget into bed , she sat down beside the bed and read to her . After a little the old lady told her to stop . Her enunciation was too rapid , she said , reminded her of a guinea 's chatter , and besides , the light attracted moths . Catherine blew the lamp out and went out on the porch . Her lips still curved in a smile as she thought of what her grandmother had said about the guinea 's chatter . It was characteristic of her . She was growing deaf and when she could not hear plainly she always maintained that the fault lay in the enunciation of the speaker . The heavy mist that rose from the creek almost every eveningfloated at the end of the lawn . Tree trunks showed black through it and here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , preparing to dive into a cold forest pool . Night fell fast here . Somewhere out in the mist a twig snapped . Any minute now Cousin Daphne would be stumblingin . If she stayed on the porch she would have to talk with her . She went quickly up the stairs to her room . A letter that had come this morning from Molly Ware was lying on the table . She glanced at it again . Molly thought that she ought to come home and reminded her that she could not disappear without having people talk . She had ended by saying , " Please write to me , Kit . " Catherine sat down before the old secretary to answer the letter but words did not come easily . She rose and went top181a dresser drawer where she kept a carton of cigarettes . As she pulled a package out the carton slipped forward , revealingher husband 's letter crumpled behind it . It was the only letter she had received from him since she had been here . She had intended to burn it and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She picked it up and , sitting down on the bed , read it through : " I want to talk with you . I suppose you would rather I did n't come there . Wo n't you come here ? I will leave the apartment if you want me to , or you can stay with Molly or at a hotel , whatever you prefer . . . . " She had been out at the box with Aunt Willy when the carrier handed the mail over and she saw opening it . Even after she was alone in her room she had delayed opening it . She hardly knew what she had expected or hoped to find , but it had not been this . She had achieved a measure of calm during the weeks that had elapsed since she had seen him . But these dry words had been like a blow in the face . The sense of loss , of horror swept over her again . She had answered at once , telling him that she had nothing to say to him and did not want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter off in the evening mail . It had seemed to her then that she had no choice , that his letter demanded only one answer . But who can answer a letter truly ? When a trivial question is asked one can commandone 's whole self in reply : we will go to dinner on Thursday night , we will not make a certain journey . But when the question is fatal the self seems to lose its identityP182or rather it splits into many selves , which engage in a Proteanstruggle for mastery . We may abhor the grinning devil who dispatched the note that broke up a lifelong friendship or shattered a happy marriage , but no matter . In the momentthat he became master he assumed our mask . We may call as loudly as we please but our friend , our lover will not answer , will hear only him . But if I had to write it over again I would write the same thing , she thought , and got up and walked about the room . From the blur of shadows over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemn child 's face , framed in dark curls . The little girl of eight or ten sat sidewise in a rope swing , her white , lacy skirts stretched out stiffly . One hand clasped a doll to her breast , with the other she steadied herself in the swing . Cousin Bessie , who had died forty years ago of eating too many ripe peaches and ever since had been staring from that rope swing . I might go to New York now , she thought . I would not commit myself to anything by going . I would simply talk with him . After all , if I am going to get a divorce we will have to see each other again , to arrange things . Besides , as Molly says , it is childish to run away . She had reached the other end of the room in her rapid strides . Seen from here Cousin Bessie 's face was not quite so impassive . The black eyes held pin-points of light , the poutinglower lip seemed instinct with secret knowledge . You ca n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that you would stay here . This is the first trip , the first pleasure she has had in years You ca n't take it away from her . P183Of course I ca n't , she thought quietly . That 's settled . I have to stay here till she gets back . She paused beside the table . The bottle that held the sleepingtablets she had been taking for several weeks was almost empty . She must remember to get it filled the next time she drove into Carthage . She might ask the druggist if he did n't have a better soporific . This medicine put her to sleep quickly but it was a sleep from which she woke fatigued , and last night she had had a grisly dream . She had descended , with another woman , into a long , dark tunnel . A man , whose relationship to her was not defined , had walked between them , resting a hand on the shoulder of each . The hand was cold . That was because the man was dead , or had been dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between life and death . Ahead of them in the vast , shadowy tunnel other people were busy with certain operations . When they had finished those operations , the man would be consigned to another grave , from which , it was hoped , he would rise . But in the meantime he walked beside her and kept his frail , intolerable hand on her shoulder . She was about to shake it off when somebody on ahead called back to her that she must be vigilant , that the man 's safety depended on her alone . She shivered and , drawing a chair up to the window , sat down , leaning her arms on the sill . The mist was creeping tip over the lawn . The trunks of the oaks were gray , wreaths trailed from their branches . On the right the mist faded in a watery blur . The new moon , shining dimly , cast a wash of yellow light on the roof of Maria 's cabin . Under it the cabin was dark . Uncle Joe and Maria had been asleep for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here Maria had used to regard her with a peculiar attentiveness . It had annoyed her . She had fancied sometimes that the negro woman could read her thoughts . But now Maria 's gaze slid over her as indifferentlyas it slid over the others , and she answered her as she answered them , only after an interval and absently , as if recalled from a distance . She was continually brooding over her boy in the penitentiary , Willy said . I am afraid her heart is broken , Willy said . If your heart were broken , if a great fissure came in the center of your being , you might turn your vision inward , might from then on contemplate only what could be seen in those shadowy depths . People in the outer world would become ghostly . You would hear their voices faintly and sometimes forget to answer , as a man , in the midst of an earthquake , standing on the edge of a precipice and gazing down into the earth 's heaving bowels , might not hearken to the voice of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster . A wisp of mist swam across the moon , obscuring its outline , leaving only a smoky blur . I hope it 's good weather at the Fair , she thought ; I hope Willy has that much luck , for once in her life . There was a noise on the stairs . Cousin Daphne had come in and was going to her room . Her door closed . There was the sound of quick steps for several minutes and then silence . What does she do when she is alone at night ? she thought , and tried to recall the details of Daphne 's abortive marriage . Her husband had abandoned her in a hotel on her wedding night . She had heard that when she was a child and it hadP185stuck in her mind . But what could have induced him to marry her in the first place , and , having taken such a step , why had he left her so abruptly ? She ca n't have been very different then from what she is now , she thought , and yet she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could she endure the shock , the humiliation ? Perhaps that is why she is so queer . Perhaps that explains her sudden advances , those embarrassing confidences , that odd , jangled laugh . She is always thinking that she is over it , that she is sound again , and then it all comes back and she knows she never will be . For a moment she was overcome with compassion . It seemed to her that everybody , that she herself , was like Daphne , half-crushed by some early misfortune and having to advance , maimed , through life , cutting in the very struggle to maintain balance a ridiculous figure that somewhere must provoke mirth . And then she felt a revulsion against the woman , against the very house that harbored her . It is this place , she thought . There was always something wrong with it . And in the silence she listened and heard the sound of the creek and it seemed to her that in its babble it announced its purpose , of flowing in a great circle about the farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fog was thicker . Here and there a gray bough showed , but most of the lawn was white and over the sycamore only a faint , yellow haze told where the moon had hung . Now that the moon was gone the mist shone whiter . It rolled up to , the window . She leaned out . The white mist receded . She kit only cool , moist air on her face . But a few feet away was the other element , into which one might plunge , as into the sea . She felt a desire to be immersed in it . If the stallionP186were here she would slip him out of his stall and ride out into it . Nobody else would be on the road , she thought . I could let him pick his way . And then she thought that if she telephoned Tom Manigault he would bring two horses and they could go for a ride together . She went to the closet , put on a pair of slacks and a dark sweater and pulled an old cap down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manigault house . There was a chance that Tom would answer the telephone himself . If he did she would tell him what she wanted . If Mrs. Manigault or one of the servants answered she could leave a message : she was missing Red and would be obliged if they could send a horse over tomorrow afternoon . She slipped her shoes off and , carrying them in her hand , opened the door and went softly out into the hall . Light still showed from under Daphne 's door . She advanced past it on tip-toe , with frequent waits between steps . At the foot of the stairs she turned back through the hall towards the ell . The door between the ell and the hall was open . She closed it and groped her way to the telephone . When Tom answered she said , " This is Catherine , " and was going on to tell him what she wanted but got only as far as " I 'd like to go for a ride , " when he interrupted her . " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he already knew what was in her mind . " Yes . I 'll be right over . " She had the presence of mind to remind him not to come to the house . " I 'll walk up the lane and meet you , " she said . " Yes , " he said , still in his preoccupied tone . " I 'll b  --  there in a few minutes . " She went out the back door and started up the path to theP187lane . A dim shape confronted her . She put her hand out and felt blunt thorns among cool leaves and knew that she had passed the Japanese quince bush that grew beside the path . Her eyes became accustomed to the dark . She made out the gray bulk of the stable looming on her right . Once she had passed it she could find no other landmark and fetched up against the fence twice before she finally opened the gates and stepped out into the soft dust of the lane . She walked down the lane . Ahead , on the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark shapes : the Shannon house and its out-buildings . Mr. Shannon had got into the habit of burning a light all night during his wife 's last illness and now that she had been dead ten years still kept the light burning . Mr. Shannon was at the Fair , with Willy . But one of his tenants was probably staying in the house , " to look after things . " She went more softly , letting her feet in leather moccasins sink deep into the dust . Here the fog was not quite so thick . Trees were tall on each side of the road . Betweenthem where the lane turned into the highway the mist ! tun , * white . A long shaft of light suddenly pierced the white . Boughs sprang out black , light slid from leaf to leaf ; a car was turning into the lane . She ran up the bank and slipped behind a tree : a chestnut-oak that had young shoots springing up waist high around it . The sound of the motor grew louder . She knelt behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust , then , with an effort , averted her face . What am I doing here , on this dark road , in this thick mist , out of the sound of human voices , out of reach of help ? There are drunk men in that car , negro men , coming home from carousing at some pig-stand . They saw my eyeballs flash then . In a minute they will stop the car and come up over the bank and I will hear them asking each other which way I ran . The car was slowing down . With infinite caution , while her eyes still darted among the trunks through which in a second she would take her flight , she turned her head . The yellow light paled , cut by a sharper gleam . A tiny flame flared from a lighter held in the driver 's hand . She sprang to her feet , calling , " Tom ! " He got out of the car and took a few uncertain steps . " Where are you ? " he asked in a low voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both her hands she dug her fingers into the hard flesh while she pressed up against him . " I thought you would be riding , " she whispered , " I thought you would be riding ! " He pulled his arm away from her clutching fingers and , setting both hands about her waist , half lifted her into the car . " I was afraid , " he said . " This blasted fog . Horse might break a leg . " She did not answer . Sitting quietly beside him , feeling his arm heavy across her cold shoulder blades while the warmth from his body struck through her thin linen garments she let her eyes rove the circle of light that , washing breast high against the tree trunks , pushed the mist back on every side . He leaned over and switched out the lights . He took her chin in his free hand and murmured . She pressed closer to him . " Yes , " she said . P189IT RAINED in the night and turned cool . In the morning the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadows of the maple leaves lay broad , almost black , yet edged , it seemed , so brilliant was the sun , with light . After the middaydinner the women came out and sat on the porch . Catherinesat with them a few minutes , then went to the garden to gather the butter beans for the morrow 's dinner . The path she followed was one that she had cut herself , through an almost tropical tangle of morning glory vines . Uncle Joe had been in bed for two weeks and Rodney was working at the Manigaults ' ; there was nobody to keep the morning glories down . Maria , for the last few mornings , had refused to go into the garden to gather the vegetables . It was too hot , she said , to gather them in the noonday sun and a person , venturing in there before the dew had dried , risked dew poison , and she showed Catherine her apron , streaked with green juices and dripping with dew . " I 'll gather them , " Catherine had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden immediately ; after breakfast . This morning , however , she had slept late and the butter beans and beets and cabbages had gone ungathered . On a day like this it was really pleasanter to gather them after the dew had dried , she thought , as she moved slowly down the rows , stripping the thick , green pods from the clustering stems . Everywhere the morning glories , climbing on stout  | okra stems , on other weeds , on the poles set for beans , erected their wreathed tents . It was always like this . Each year Uncle Joe put in a garden large enough for three families , cultivatedit for several weeks and then abandoned it to the morning glories . One might have thought them the main crop and the okra , the beets , the onions , showing here and there through the swaying wreaths , the weeds that the gardenerhad not had time to eliminate . She remembered a garden she had had one year on a small , terraced plot , overlookingthe Mediterranean . Not a weed had showed itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snails which every morning were found , half dissolved , flattened against the ring of arsenous powder with which every night she outlined the plot . The basket was half full of beans . She stopped and rooted up half a dozen onions . One of the swollen , green stalks broke . She wiped the juice off on her rough apron , then held her hand up to her face and breathed in the rank odor , and thought : I am going to live in the country the rest of my life . She left the row and went towards the gate . The house came in view . The women were still sitting on the porch . A bough of the maple tree , hanging low , framed them in a green bower . The shadows that flecked their white skirts were only paler leaves from the same bough . The sun streaks that darted in and out among the shadows edged every leaf with light and spilled in a white sheen on the hard earth below the steps . She looked away over the lawn . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topmost boughs had thep191same sheen , as if the leaves were on the verge of dissolving in the bright air . She glanced back at the house . One of the women had leaned over to retrieve a book . Something else moved in the corner next to the door . But there were only two women sitting on the porch ! The third woman was a hundred miles away . She stared into the corner and saw a drift of shadows sway again in the slight breeze that had sprung up . She passed through the gate and moved slowly across the lawn . Her head a little tilted back , she took the barely perceptiblewind on her cheeks , while her eyes roved the upper boughs or fell to the gray clapboards . She told herself that she had never seen the old house wear so cheerful a look . It was , she supposed , haunted . At least it always had been for her . Often when she was a child , playing in one of the quiet rooms or out on the lawn under the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the air or change of light that she was not alone , and to preserve her privacy she would turn her back or go off to play in another place . The presences had been then only companions whom one could not conveniently address . After she became a woman they had seemed at times to menace or at least to prophesy evil . Four nights ago their voices had driven her out of the house , into the fog , into the arms , she recalled , with a secret smile , of her lover . This morning , as she walked in the bright , scarcely stirring air across the lawn towards the women on the porch the presences spoke in the tones they had used in childhood , but so compellingly that she stopped and with a quick , sidewise turn of the head , looked behind her . There seemed actually to be a stirring of the air all about her , a gentle , continuous murmur that would have resolved itself into speech had there been an ear - fine enough to catch it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as she gazed about her it seemed that all the broad stretches of sunlight were crowded with the presences . But they were not here to warn or implore . Their voices were kind , their aspects gay . If they moved under the trees it was to dance . She told herself that there were no presences , no audible cries , that it was her own mood , coupled with the fine weather , that made everything wear so kind an air , and as she loitered across the grass she reflected on her plight . She wondered why she had always felt that certain actions which she constantly condoned in her friends were not for her . Mona Gilbert had told her that she had only begun to live after she divorced Harry and married Bill . I was married young , too , she thought . Maybe I 've only begun to live now and it seemed to her , looking back , that her marriage had been only a long straining to live up to what her husband demanded of her . She recalled evenings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or half a dozen , conducted a conversation of which only an occasional phrase was intelligibleto her . It had always been like that . When she had the opportunity of making new friends  --  and she rarely had that opportunity nowadays  --  her first thought was not whether she liked the new acquaintances or whether they liked her but whether they would be acceptable to her husband . Even now , after fifteen years of married life , she could not tell what would bore him . Her old girlhood friend , Molly Ware  --  a rattlepate if there ever was one  --  was one of the people he liked to have around . He listened to everythingp193Molly said and often had long discussions with her . But there was Sylvia Brice , who had a good mind and would have liked to talk with Jim . You could hardly get him to stay in the same room with her , and if he did stay , if he did presentthe appearance of listening , it was with what Molly called his " glassy look " and his replies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was following his own train of thought all the time . If she were to marry Tom Manigault  --  and she was at the moment determined to marry him  --  her life would be very different from what it had been with Jim . They would live in the country . There would be the succession of country pleasures which so absorbed and delighted her . It is the life I was made for , she thought , the life I have always missed . She thought of Tom . Since that night of the fog she had met him alone twice , each time in the woods . That first day when she had come along the path he was standing under the oak tree but he did not come to meet her . He stood and gazed , as intently as he had gazed when he first saw her , that day she rode over to Big Pond . He did not speak or move until she was opposite him , then he said : " I stayed awake all last night , wondering if it was true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He came and stood over her . " I turned on the light , " he said . " I saw this , " and he pulled out of his pocket the old cap she had asked him to stow there on the night of the fog . " I saw this , " he said , " and I knew it was so . " She laughed again , taking the cap out of his slightly reluctanthand . " You 're like a puppy , " she said . " You give a puppy your old shirt to sleep on and he 'll stop howling . " Later , for without any other word he had set his hand onp194her throat and borne her down , still half laughing , among the dead leaves , later , when they sat side by side , silent , subdued , watching the bright spears of sunlight strike from leaf to leaf , down on to the brown floor of this secret place , she had reminded him that she was ten years older than he was . " How will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " I do n't care if you 're as old as Methuselah , " he said . " We are going to get married . . . . We are going to get married , are n't we ? " he repeated and abruptly turned and looked at her . The strange yellow flecks in his eyes had given them an almost metallic gleam . But there was something in his look besides resolution , an apprehension that amounted almost to terror . It had hurt her to see him look that way and she had put her hand out quickly to cover his . " Yes , we 're going to get married , " she said . " I 'll go to Reno . As soon as Willy gets back . " She was at the porch . She put her basket down and dropped down on the top step . " There are your butter beans , " she said . Mrs. Lewis turned her massive head on which the white , curling hair still grew vigorously . Her blue eyes were growingdim but their gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of late she sat often and stared in a kind of fierce bemusement . What was she staring at ? She was leaning over to pinch a bean . " They 're filled out , " she said . " Sometimes Maria 'll pick beans before they 're filled out . " The dog had rushed into the hall to lap water from his bowl and now rushed out again . The old lady drew herP195white linen skirts aside as he pushed past her and sniffed a little . " That dog has been rolling in something , " she said . Catherine leaned over and sniffed , too , then straightening up , drew the dog to her . " Oh , no , " she said , " He smells sweet . " She held him against her , erect on his hind legs , and intoned in a high , squeaky voice : " Sometimes I roll in manure , Just to increase my glamour ... " Cousin Daphne 's black eyes were bright . " Is that a poem ? " she enquired . " He often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ode to his mother . It says : If you loved me as I love you , You 'd treat me a whole lot better'n you do .. . " Does he write many poems ? " Cousin Daphne asked . " He has n't written many since he 's been down here . He is n't really a Nature poet . But when he 's in town . . . " She fell silent , watching the dog pad down the steps to settle himself in the soft dust between two maple roots . The old ladies had been shocked by Heros ' poem but they liked it . . . . Jim always liked Heros ' poems . They could n't be too silly for him . He even liked him to make puns . When he got home in the evening he always asked what Heros had said during the day , and if he had n't " talked " she had to make something up . . . . But he had n't talked now for a long time . This was the first time he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought of her husband out of her mind . " It 's because I 'm happy , " she thought . " He always talks when I 'm happy . . . " The floor boards creaked as the old lady rose . Catherine got up quickly and fetched her cane from where it stood in the corner . The old lady stood a moment , leaning on it heavily and looking down at her cousin . Daphne lay back in her rocker , her legs hooked over a rung of a straight chair drawn up in front of her . The old lady seemed to be eyeing the thick ankles encased in black cotton stockings . Daphne , as if aware that the scrutiny was unflattering , withdrew her feet from the other chair and sat up straighter . The old woman laughed . " You sit like all the Passavants , " she said . She went slowly across the porch and down the hall . Catherine followed her into her room . Old Catherine sat down in the broad-bottomed rocker which stood always besideher bed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoelaces . Catherine dropped on the floor in front of her . " Let me ( lo it , Mammy , " she said . She quickly untied the lace and withdrew the foot from the soft , black shoe . She had taken both shoes off and was about to slip her grandmother 's feet into bedroom slippers , when the old woman suddenly elevated her legs and held them stiffly out before her . The feet , encased in white cotton stockings , looked not so much like feet as mittens , stuffed , Catherine thought , with cotton batting , ready to hang on some child 's Christmas tree . " Do your feet hurt , Mammy ? " she asked . Mrs. Lewis shook her head , and then with uncharacteris/tic frankness : " I wish they did . Sometimes I feel like I 'd give anything to have some feeling in them , even if it was pain . " " It 's not your feet , though . It 's your ankles , is n't it ? " The old woman stood up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with an axe and lop it off . " She held her arms out like a child while Catherine unbuttonedher shirtwaist and slipped her skirt over her head . Catherine laid the garments on a chair while her grandmother , in her old-fashioned chemise , went behind the screen to wash her face and hands . She took a long time . Catherine sat down and waited , hands folded in her lap . From behind the screen came sighs and splashings . Catherine thought of the morning bath in which the old lady sat firmly planted on a stool while a basin of soapy water and a wash cloth were extended to her at intervals by the attendant who must lurk on the other side of the screen . " It would n't be so hard if she were n't so damned modest , " she thought . " How does Willy stand it , day after day ? " Her hands moved nervously . She folded them again . " I must be like that , " she thought , " I must do everything as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gazed about the dim room it seemed to her that if she were not as attentive to her grandmother , as patient as Willy herself , her new happiness might be menaced . Already the exhilaration that had come to her in the last few minutes was fading . It was the effect of this room , where the blinds were nearly always drawn , in the morning because the old lady 's toilet was still in progress , in the afternoon to exclude the heat of the sun . Outdoorsit was still light . As soon as her grandmother was settled in bed she would announce to Daphne that she was going for a walk . She had promised to meet Tom in the woods . " It 's absurd that I ca n't have him at the house , " she thought . Still , it does n't matter . I like it better in the woods . ... It 's going to be all right . Everything is going to be all right . I 'm going to be happy . There is n't any reason why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked heavily across the floor and climbed into bed . Catherine approached and drew the sheet up as high as her breast , then bent and kissed her lightly on the brow . " Have a good sleep , " she said . The old woman , lying on her feather pillow , did not acknowledge the caress . She stared at the wall . Catherine was halfway across the room before she spoke . " When I was eighteen I could span my ankle with my finger and thumb . " Catherine laughed . " Heavens , Mammy ! I bet you were vain . " The old woman 's dark gaze still fixed the faded wall paper.She did not answer . After a moment Catherine closed the door and stepped out into the hall . The old woman slipped down between the sheets , turning her body sidewise until the feathers hollowed out under her left hip , then brought one of her hands up and laid it beside her cheek on the cool pillow . In the hall she could hear Catherine 's voice in the high , maudlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dachshund . She gets it from the Lewises , she thought . It is a habit that runs in families . I 'm glad John never had it . I could not have borne it . No , I could not have borne that . P199Catherine was going upstairs , accompanied by the dog . Mother . . . Mother . . . Mother . Long ago she had heard her father comment on the fact that childless couples often addressed each other as " Mother " and " Father , " as if recognizingthe existence of an imaginary child . But Catherine made a dog call her mother . She wondered if the girl were barren . Probably not . People sometimes took a notion not to have children nowadays and if they took the notion they could keep from having them , it seemed . Agnes had probablygot on to those new-fangled ways , too , after she went to New York to live ; she had never had but the one child . It might be that women did n't have to do anything nowadays , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thirty-five years old but she acted more like a girl than a woman . Perhaps when a woman did n't mature her seed did n't ripen either . In time there might not be any more children . The race might vanish from the earth . She turned her head fretfully on her pillow . " I must be a little feverish , " she thought . " Such notions ! " Catherine had come downstairs and was going out with the dog , who was speaking French now . " Irons plus au bois , Mother . Irons plus au bois . . . . Beaucoup des lauriers . " Catherine-was telling him not to be so free , but to address her as Madame ma mere . The old woman shivered and held her hand out before her , the gnarled fingers spread at first and then , bending inward , seeming to clutch at something . I have lived a long time and have seen those I loved die end have known other troubles and other sorrows and still *ere are two sounds I can not endure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an open field , human words put into the mouth of a beast . In the hall the light , ironical voice called out once , then died away . She is in the woods now , she thought , on that path that goes to the spring . But there is some one there before her , the woman who is always on that path . Sometimes she is lying face down and her fingers rustle the leaves . Sometimes she stoops over , gathering into her apron pieces of dead wood , broken twigs , dry leaves . . . . That is because I came that way the first time and the last time too . . . . She is moving aside . I never saw her move aside before . It is for Catherine ! Her granddaughter was stepping too lightly past the stooping woman . She knew anger , thinking of the poor hearth on which the woman would fan the broken twigs , the dry leaves to a blaze . And then it seemed to her that her granddaughter had gone on and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown under her feet and above the open field that could be glimpsed through a break in the woods , a crow flew towards the sun , cawing . " I hate to hear crows caw , " Sue Robinson said . " It always sounds sO sad . " " It sounds mad and glad , you fool , but what good is it when your voice whines on and your sallow face turns to us at every bend in the path ? " Ned was thinking the same thing . He looked at her and then he looked at me and smiled and all the light came to a point in his eyes . I thought , he will be gone tomorrow and I hurried and caught up with her . " If you will read to Aunt Jessie thisP201afternoon I will do it three times running , " I said . She stared and the corners of her mouth drew down . But my hand was on her arm . I pushed her . " If you do n't I 'll never let you wear my filigree necklace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her go off down the path . And I was frightened at what I had done . " She will tell everybody , " I said . " She will tell everybody we are off here in the woods by ourselves and would not let her stay with us . He did not say anything till she was out of sight and then he whispered " Kit ! " and I forgot how I was not going to let him kiss me  --  the girls all said he was such a flirt  --  and we sat down on a log by the path and I let him kiss me until I feared I was all tousled and drew back . He put his head down in my lap then . I could feel his lips hot through my thin , summer skirts and I brought my hand down over his black hair and I said , " Ned , please , " and he straightened up . " I wo n't be here tomorrow , " he said . They went to Camp Dick Taylor first . There were thirty rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Molly , for him . She thought she was going too . " You stay here with Miss Kit . . . . " She was wagging her tail long after they were out of sight . . . . I was the first girl in the neighborhood to get a letter . He said he wore the scarf I knitted for him all the time . The boys were teasing him because it got dirty . He washed it out sometimes in a branch or pond , he said , but plc did not take it off except for that . I got more letters than any girl in the neighborhood . . . . Until ' 64 . The letters didmot get through then . . . In the summer Joe Torrant came home . He had lost hisP202leg and the other foot was gangrenous . They propped him in the doorway where the breeze came . He kept singing : A life on the Vicksburg bluff , A home in the trenches deep , Where we 've dodged Yank shells enough , And our old pea bread wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , and he wished he had cut his heart out before he left there , while he could still get around . Pea bread . . . Pea bread . . . Our old pea bread wo n't keep . . . . You laid a piece down and it would crawl away , Joe said . . . . It was not so hard going without the letters . I knew he was at Vicksburg and we were all waiting . I thought all I had to do was wait . And then Vicksburg fell . " We may not win the war , " Uncle Cleve said , " I never thought to say it but we may not win the war . " Mama went over and caught him by the shoulder and shook him . " You old fool ! You sit there and wear out pants while better men are dying . We ca n't lose ! " She raised her head and glared around and the same trees were in the yard and the sun was on the lowest step the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " We ca n't lose ! " There was a wet spot on the floor where spit had fallen out of Uncle Cleve 's mouth . Mama was sitting down and her head was in her hands and she was crying . " I 've struck your father 's brother . An old man . I do n't know what got into me . I think I 'm going crazy . " Ned was at home then . Joe Torrant told us . He had his goats trained to a wagon by that time and he stopped at theP203gate and asked if we heard any news from Cousin John 's folks . " Not for some time , " Mama said . " How are they ? " " They ca n't do anything with Ned , " he said . I stood where I was in the hall but Mama went down the steps . She kept her voice low but I heard . " Is he hurt much ? " He looked at his stump stretched out before him . " He feels it more than I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear it from him . I went upstairs and lay down . The plaster in the ceiling was cracked the way the ground gets after it has stood under water too long . If I could only get through the afternoon ! He will be here by supper time , I thought . Something has happened and he could not get away , but he will be here by supper time . After a while Mama came and stood in the doorway . Ned and John Lewis had both been home several days , she said . She did n't know why we had n't heard . John was all right but a bullet had gone through Ned 's neck . His face was paralyzed . He could n't talk plain . I was looking at the ceiling . If I could get my hands into the largest crack and tear hard enough it would all come down . . . . Certainly I can come down to supper . I am perfectlywell . Joe Torrant was still there . And John had walked over from Oak Quarter . Joe would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was in the house he told us how Ned went off to the creek every day . " But he wo n't let anybody go with him . " I looked up and I saw the evening star over the cedar and I knew it would be light for a long time yet . I got up andP204went in the house . John was coming through the hall but he did not say anything to me . I went out the back way and slipped around through the tall weeds . The old dog went with me . I stood there on the path a long time and then I heard something move off down towards the creek . There is a bluff there above a deep hole . They sit on the bank and drop their lines over . He was standing under the sycamore tree . The pole was lying on the ground and he had the line in his hand , trying to put the bait on . But his hands shook and the line jumped back and forth as if it had a fish on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sumac . I had to keep pushing the branches aside . He heard me and turned around . His face was there , with the leaves all around it , shaking , the lips stretched flat over the teeth , the eyes glazed and then the glaze went away ; the eyes grew fierce . The line that he still held came up between us in a great loop . He flung it from him and took hold of the trunk of the tree with both hands , his face still turned towards me and I knew he was holding on to the tree to keep from shaking , and I was through the sumac , I would have been with him in another second , when he cried out . The first time it was a sound such as children make when they say , " No , I ca n't talk . I am this beast or that beast , " and they go " Gobble . . . Gobble . . . " " Gobble . . . gobble " they will go . It was only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not answer and ran on he cried out again . I was not afraid of him . Before God I was not afraid of his look or of that deeper , harsher sound he was making . It was hisp205upraised hand . I knew that when he struck me it would still be shaking and I could not bear it . I put my own hand up over my face . I turned back . The dog crashed past me . I came out on the path by the spring . Sun still trembled on that big rock , on the ferns that pushed up around it . I fell face down , I tasted earth , I clawed at the dead leaves . There was no feeling in me , except in those fingers pushing the dry leaves aside , digging deeper into the damp earth , moles that , having endured the light of day for a second , must seek their holes underground . I think I went to sleep . It was dark and I was cold and stiff and my fingers had not moved for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a noise down by the ravine . The dog was on the path , barking . " He is going home now , " I thought . " She is going with him , the way a dog goes with you , circling two miles to your one . I will not have the care of her any longer , " I thought and I fell to laughing , alone in the woods . I laughed a long while , not caring who heard me and then I got up and went home . I went another way from the way I had come , through a field that was grown up in milkweed and goldenrod . I lost the path and did not try to find it again but went through the weeds that were breast high and rank with dew . The moon was out . I stood still in the middle of the field and the white light was over everything and I saw the house black under the trees and I did not want to go back to it . They were sitting on the porch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench in the shadow of the vines . My skirts were all dark with dew . Nobody said anything about it . I did not go upstairs to change ; I sat and talked with them until Mama told Joe Torrant which room he was to sleep in and said she was going in to bed . When they had left I got up and sat down on the top step of the porch . " The sun dries things . Maybe the moon will dry them , too , " I said and spread my skirts out around me . John came and sat beside me . He put out his hand and touched my wet skirt . " You came through the field , " he said . " You ought not to have come through those weeds . " " It was the shortest way home , " I said . He said : " The next time you want to go for a walk , let me know . It is dangerous for you to go about by yourself . Promiseyou will let me know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he came he brought me Ned 's letter . I saw the backing : Miss Catherine Fearson . Kindness of Bro. ' no. and I hated the letters that could talk so surely and steadily and I would not have read it but John was looking at me ; so I read it through and when I had finished it I said , " I do not think that this letter needs to be preserved , " and I tore it into four pieces and threw them into the fireplace . We were sitting in the parlor . They lay there among the dead ashes all the time we were talking but before John left he pushed them over against a live coal with the toe of his boot and we stood there and watched them flare up and turn gray . " That is what you wanted me to do , is n't it ? " he said , and I said , " That is what I wanted you to do . " I did not go to Oak Quarter for a long time after John and I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be painful for you and painful for Brother Ned . " He would not come where there was company . He livedp207in the office . His sister , Martha , used to go down and sit with him . He would write to her , on the tablet they kept hanging by the door , but he would not speak . But he would talk to the old setter , Molly . Martha would sit there all afternoon , with her work , and he would be talking to the old bitch . Jack was three years old that day we went past the office on our way to the mulberry grove . Ned was standing in the doorway as we came down the path . He had on some old nankeen trousers and above his soiled waistcoast he wore my scarf . Jack saw the old dog and broke from me . I stooped and had hold of his hand when I heard over my head the sounds and , still stooping , looked past the man 's legs into the room . It smelled of mildew and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one , they said  --  and the table was piled high with men 's and horses ' gear . They could clean it up , I thought . They need not let him live like that . I straightenedup and the sounds had stopped . Martha was smiling . " Molly says leave the boy here while you gather the mul-berries . " I looked at Ned . His eyes were bright and he smiled , looking down at the child , squatting in the dust , his arms around the old dog , and sounds broke from him again . " She 'll take good care of him , " Martha said and we walked on . The mulberry grove was on a rise in the middle of a field , a wind blowing through it and the ground clean except where the yellow leaves and the black mulberries were fallen . " He makes the dog talk for him ! " Belle Rogers said.  | " He did it when he was a boy , " Martha said . " We used to have an old gray cat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stool for him . . . . Gim me ' at piece . . . . Gim me ' at piece ! .. . and if Mama said anything the boys would loose those horriblecat-calls and say Tobe 's feelings were hurt . I do n't see how Mama stood it . . . . " " It sounds so queer when he ca n't talk plain . " " I can understand him , " Martha said . " I understand every word he speaks . " " But does he ever say anything to you ? They say he always puts everything into the dog 's mouth . " " Will you be visiting in the neighborhood much longer ? " Martha asked and her voice was cold as she straightened up , resting the full basket of mulberries against her hip . My basket was full , too . I walked away from them . I could see the field through the black trunks . It was sown in wheat . Yellow on top , but where the wind ran were caves , red like earth . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing , resting their guns on top of the embankment . The Yanks would stop for breakfast and an hour at noon and again at sunset , but except for that the noise went on all the time . Regular , like axes clearing new-ground . The Minie balls were nailing on the shingles , Jim Waldrop said . Ai n't they got the house up yet ? he said every morning . Ai n't they got the house up yet ? Oh , listen to the Minie balls , Oh , listen to the Min i6 balls . And the Minie balls are singing in the air . . . . They would not ask for a flag of truce , so their dead went unburied . There were as many wounded as dead . ... I let that boy from the mountains go , once , with water . He wanted to go back . There was a man kept stirring , tryingP209to brain himself with his musket . He made me go to the parapet and look . A Minie ball took his cap off . Get back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thirtieth . Their parallels were within seventy-five feet of our works ; the only thing was to counter-mine . We had seven shovels . But Joe Torrant took three men and went to the hill and cut hickory staves and sharpened them . I kept fifty men on the night shift . In the morning when I went into the trench I stepped in their vomit . It was hotter when the sun got up . That was the hottestday of all , but enough breeze to carry the smell . My sweat burned my eyes . When I went past the bucket I would throw a dipper of water in them . It took a minute to clear away ; I heard the courier before I saw him . . . . General Pemberton . . . . Oh , listen to the Parrott shells , Oh , listen to the Parrott shells and the Parrott shells are whistling in the air . . . . I stood up . The river shone like brass and the sky was high and bright . The man who had been trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it not to rain , I said , the sun will finish them up quicker , I said and I followed the courier out of the trenches . Major Ross was in there with the general but he went away . The general 's hair is turning gray . He talks as if there were more than us two in the tent . . . . Safety in numbers , though I do not doubt that Captain Wise has gotten through , in which case General Johnston will move immediately ... . You can not smell them from here . A woodpecker has just lit on the tent-pole . There are still birds ! . . . If I leave them it is to get help . Joe said five rounds . . . . I have heard that you are an excellent swimmer . . . . Yes , General , yes . CertainlyI can get through . . . . You have a good memory ?   ... Yes , General . . . . Then I will not commit the message to writing ... . There was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was at the mouth of the creek when the masked battery opened up . . . . It took the transport a long time to burn . I heard the bushes crackling around me and knew that they had changed the range and I slipped under the branches of a water-oak and floated out into the river . There were no gun-boats , only bluffs steeper and blacker than ordinary and over my head the sky was rosy like it is before dawn and the water had little cool currents in it . . . . If I left them it was to get help . Joe said five rounds . . . . And then the sky was gray again and I turned over and struck out free and it got darker and the cool currents bubbled up all around me and each stroke I took was stronger than the last . . . . But you could not swim on through the cool water . You had to get up on the bank . The horse was cropping grass on the edge of the woods . 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the woods as long as I could . It was a wagon road I came out on ; you would not have thought it was guarded . The one who saw me first had a handkerchief tied over his mouth to keep the dust out . He fired too quick . It was the man behind him got me . When I opened my eyes they were not there . The officer had an apple clenched in his teeth when he bent to feel inside my shirt . It was the trickle of green juice set my chest on fire and then the flames started up everywhere . After a while , when they were burning steadily , he was still there ... . Yes , he is badly hurt , but I think he can talk . . . . You will save yourself a great deal of trouble . . . . His lips were moistP211under a brown moustache . Through the burning I could feel his hand moving inside my shirt . It is not there . It is inside and now it will never get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I held my lips flat against my teeth and sent my eyes deep into his and spoke the words that made him start and fall back while the shaken bushes rained gray dust all around us , the words that nobody can understand , that nobody can bear to hear , the only words I will ever speak from now until the time I die . She moved restlessly on her pillow . It is a long time ago , she thought , and I did not love him any better than John , only in a different way . But there is not time to think of that now . There is only the one thing to think of , ever . They have been here all the time . I can not think why I never saw them before . They have been with me all along ! Sometimes their shadows fell ahead of mine , and even then I did not notice . . . . Until that day when she was standing there . I can not remember what went before but it was early morningand I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bricks . And she was standing there in a white morning robe on the back gallery . She had her head bent a little to one side and her hair was all fallen down . She did not look at me but gazed straight ahead from under the dark hair and I thought how she would stand , doing some small thing , gazing , while a whole morning went by , and I called to her sharply . " Have you picked the raspberries ? " But she did not turn , she did not answer , and I went towards her . " They ought to have been picked while the dew was on them , " I said and reminded her of how many people thereP212were in the house and how much there was to do , and then somebody somewhere else said something and I tried to answer but all the time I knew I must look at her . But I could not see her face plainly for the hair . . . . And then she turned , she was looking at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was or what she would have said , but I would have known in a minute . I would have known , but a person was beside me on the walk , touching my shoulders , my arms . I said " Alice ? " and then I knew by the touch of the hands that it was not Alice and I was afraid . But Willy was there and she put her arms around me and read to me and all the rest of that day it was just like it is every day . It has only happened once and it may never happen again . . . . It will come some other way . But it does not matter what way it comes . It is there , waiting . It has been there all the time ; I can not think why I never knew it before . And you can not tell whether it will just be being with them or something else . . . . I did not mind her gaze or the dark way her hair fell . It was the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees were not there , either , and I did not know who I was or who the person was who kept calling . When John died I did not think about it . I would turn over in the night and cry for the emptiness . And then I would be under the earth with him . But he could not look at me for the earth stopping his eyes . It was the earth heavy on his eyes that I could not bear . And the worms . . . . I never thought of the wandering . . . . For that will be the worst thing . And it will be in a place like no place you have ever seen and people will come and go and never answer and you will not know where you arc.  | ... I know that my Redeemer liveth .... Hail , Mary , full of Grace , Blessed art thou among women . . . . Aunt Rosa was a devout Catholic and died with her rosary in her hand , but if they had n't sent her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like all the Fearsons . How lovely the crab apple is in the spring ! In old times , when they cut down the trees , they always left it standing ; " the lady tree " they called it . That little island has been there in the creek ever since I was a child . But then the wild geraniums grew down into the water . The water has washed them all away . It is deeper than it used to be . If it were not so deep I would cross over and rest in the shade of the lady tree . But the water is deeper than I remember and off in the woods there are people , laughing . . . . He has been there all the time , smiling at me through the leaves ! He is coming out from under the boughs , his hand is stretched out ... . But there is some one here beside me . . . . I can not stay with you , Ned . John is calling . But you may take my hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remembered . If we slipped and went down , the people in the woods would not know but would keep on laughing . . . . The mist is rising . I can not see your face for the mist but I know the touch of your hand . . . . There is so much mist . If we do not hurry we will lose him . . . . No , he is there , still smiling . And the leaves are green all around him . . . . Will you come up and rest with us , on the bank , among all the green leaves ? P214DAPHNE CALLED to Catherine as she was leaving the house , but she did not answer and went on towards the woods . Tom was there before her . He had ridden in from the upper road and had thrown the reins over his mare 's neck and turned her loose to crop the long , fragile grass that grew in the ravine . Catherine exclaimed when she saw the mare . " She 'll go home , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed and scour the country . " He laughed . " No , she wo n't , " he said and whistled . The mare stopped grazing and took a step towards them , her mild eye fixing his . When he did not whistle again her head sank and she moved forward , slowly cropping grass . " I trained her myself , " he said . " Comes like a dog . " " I ) id you break her ? " " She did n't need any breaking . I just slipped a bridle on her one day and threw my leg over her and we rode down to the mail box . All that High Cloud stock is gentle ... . You want a colt out of her ? " " I 'll have to think about it , " Catherine said . " I believe I like Daisy better . " " That 's because you do n't know one horse from another , " he said . " I could n't know very much about them , " Catherine said meekly . " I live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bicycle under the stairs . "   " God , I 'd hate to live on East Sixty-fifth Street ! " he said . She did not answer , running her hands through the long grass that came up all around them . " You will often find Agaricus silvicola in this woods grass , " she said . " There is another mushroom that much resembles it , distinguished by the floccose brown scales which ornament the pileus .... " " That Cousin Daphne is too much for me . You say she cats ' em ? " " We had a tasty little mess of Trompete du Mort last night . " " Trumpet of Death ? " he said , " I do n't want you eating that kind of thing . You hear ? I do n't want you eating any more of them . " He had thrown himself on his back on the grass and now he stretched his arms up and clasping them behind Catherine'sneck , made her bend and kiss him ; then would have drawn her down beside him but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " I 'm out of breath , " she said . " I had a terrible time , getting away from Cousin Daphne . " " Anybody would think you were three years old , the way they treat you , " he said . " I 'm thirty-five , " she said , evenly , looking over his head up the ravine , where the gray beech trunks rose out of the all grass . A few of the beeches were already showing yellowleaves . The lively color did not seem a presage of Autumn but only an added touch of opulence in the summergreen . It is a Giorgione landscape , she thought . The trees , the luminous shadows , the horse cropping grass and the warrior , recumbent , with his mistress beside him . OnlyP216I ought to be naked and more voluptuous looking . What is the matter with me , she thought , that I view this scene as if I were a beholder and not an actor ? Has Jim infected me so that I must see everything through his eyes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath back ? " he asked , smiling and looking into her eyes . She felt his hand on her waist , moving her body slowly towards his and she put her arm up about his neck , drawing his head down till their lips met in a long kiss and then , shuddering with the suddenly communicated desire , she stretched herself on the earth and looking up saw over the crisp , sun-burned hairs of his head the sky blue against green leaves before she closed her eyes against the too ardent gaze and was alone on the sandy beach and the cruel , green , foaming waves plunging hard and the beach quiet until , roused by the strokes , it curves upwards and they cling together in the cool , climbing , ocean-beaming air before the jealous sea draws the wave back and the beach , relinquished , lies quiet under the moon . He had turned a little away from her and lay on his back , his head resting on his upstretched arm . She pressed against him , thrusting her head into the hollow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her closer . She shut her eyes . There was no sound except the minute singingof some insect hanging on a blade of grass . The grasses that their bodies had crushed gave off a sweet smell . We ought to be lying in a bed , she thought , but it is only tall grass . Leave them lying on the bracken , leave them lying where they fell , better bier ye can not fashion , none becomes them half so well . . . . It is not a bier . It is our marriageP217bed . And I do not mind its being in the woods , where any one can come and surprise us . It is you who are amazed , my clear . We are surprised if only everything is all right , if only everything is all right . She sat up and put her hands to her hair and drew a silver box out of her pocket and looked into the tiny mirror and powdered her face . The reins had slipped down over the mare 's head and the snake-like thongs whipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went over and adjusted the reins on her neck , then came back and sat down beside Catherine . He put his hand over hers . " I wish we could go away from here , " he said . " It 's only three more days , " she said . " Willy will be back on the twelfth . I 'll leave the next day . " " You have n't written Chapman ? " he asked abruptly . " I have n't told him that I 'm going to Reno . " " Why have n't you ? " She made an impatient gesture . " I have n't been communicatingwith him . I 've written him only once since I 've been down here . After all , he is n't particularly concerned about the date . " Or is he ? she asked herself .

" " I went in the kitchen last night , to get a drink of water , and there was Roy , sitting up on a stool and drying glasses for Rodney and the two of ' em laughing and talking . " " I do n't see anything wrong with that . Tom , you know yourself you like to talk to niggers . And Roy is awfully curious , about how people live and everything like that .

They 're not going to let anything stand between them and their pleasures . Mother knows all about it . She just wo n't admit it . " " I should think it would be hard for her to admit it , " she said . " After all she comes of a different generation from ours . I doubt if she knows what a fairy is . " " She lived in France a long time , " he said . " Yes , but she frequented high society . That Frenchman who stayed with you all at Sands Point . . . . It was perfectlyobvious , but he was the son of that princess and nobodysaid anything about it .... " He was silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't be upset , " she said . " He 'll be going away soon . It 'll be much better if you do n't have a row . " P219He did not say anything for several minutes , then he said in a low , constrained tone , " If she did n't have him she 'd get somebody else . " " You mean you think she keeps Miller around just to annoy you ? " He did not answer . " Tom ? " she urged gently . He raised his head and looked into her eyes , but his gaze , even while it met hers , was withdrawn , self-absorbed . A slight , secretive smile trembled on his lips . " You do n't know , " he said . " I know that she 's a very vain , spoiled woman . And I do n't think she 's ever taken the proper kind of interest in you . " She takes an interest in me , all right . That 's why she 's down here . She ca n't stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of anything to say . He was kicking at the earth with his booted foot . The mask-like smile widened . If he lifted his eyes to hers they would still have that cloudy , withdrawn look . She tightened her clasp on his arm . " Tom , what do you mean ? " He looked up . His eyes brightened . He laughed , without mirth . " It was when I was about eight years old . Out at Sands Point . She and the old man had been quarrelling and I came in after he 'd left the house . She was lying there , looking out to sea , and she turned around when I came in and she looked at me . She looked at me and I knew what she was thinking . " " That she hated you ? " He nodded . " I do n't know what they 'd been quarrelling about . Maybe she had more principles then than she hasP220now . Maybe she felt she could n't divorce the old man becauseof me . I do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at me until finally she turned away and her handkerchief whipped up in her hands and she told me to call her maid . But I did n't do it . I just walked out of the room . " " They say women often hate their children , " she said softly . " Well , when anybody starts hating me I hate them back . I started hating her when I was eight years old . " The mare stopped grazing and came over and stood in front of them . Her wide look said that it was time to go home . Catherine made an unconscious gesture and the animal , repelled by the light motion of the hand , walked away . The land is not enough for him , Catherine thought , or his beasts or his friends or the women he will love . There was something went before . And it is no use to tell him that his mother is not one to awaken either love or hate . The enchantmentfell too early and her features are the most glamorous that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that brightest moment of danger . She felt tired . " I 'm sorry , " she murmured and gave his unresponding arm a quick pressure , and let her hands fall in her lap . It must be four o'clock , she thought , the light has changed . She looked up the ravine . The light had changed , but not towards evening . It was brighter than she had ever seen it before in the woods . Every leaf glittered with light . And the hush was oppressive , as if some power somewhere had abruptly stilled all sounds . I have made a mistake , she thought , I have taken the wrong road and it isP22Itoo late to turn back . Am I lost ? She trembled . It seemed to her that she was alone in the woods and the glittering light had a voice , a voice that would have spoken but for the commandlaid upon it , and then suddenly the stilled woods gave tongue and the air all around was quivering with the wild , high-pitched , despairing cry that brought her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .   " It WAS DREADFUL for Catherine , " Mrs. Manigault said . " But how fortunate that Tom happened to come by , " Miller remarked . She gave him a quick glance . " He was n't there at the time ? " " No . Cousin Daphne found her , although you would think it was Rodney , to hear him tell it . " Miller raised his voice to a falsetto . " Old Miss laying there in a pool of blood , and did n't know nobody nor nothing , and never will know nothing , the doctor say . ' " " I wish you did n't find it necessary to roll your eyes when you imitate Rodney , " Mrs. Manigault said . " Did the doctor really say that ? " " It was a brain hemorrhage , accompanied by complete loss of memory . She may get her memory back , of course . She may live on for years . " They had dined on the terrace and after the table was cleared had sat on in the dusk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through the window she could see Tom sitting at his desk . He had gone in after dinner , sayinghe had some accounts to figure and had been there at the desk ever since . A few minutes ago she had seen him close the book in which he kept his accounts . He had not risen from the desk but sat smoking and staring at the wall . " Tom ? " she called and saw him slowly turn his head . When he did not rise she called him again . " Tom , do you P223suppose I ought to go-over to the Lewises ? Is there anything I could do ? " He got up and came and stood in the doorway . " Catherine said she was going to nurse her herself . Said Cousin Willy would n't want them to get a nurse . And she 's not going to telegraph Willy . " " No , " she said thoughtfully . " That poor Willy ! It was dreary enough before . And now she will have to play nursemaidfor the rest of her life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Miller said cheerfully . " She 'll live for years , " she said with conviction . " There 's nothing improves the health like loss of memory . " " I suppose so , " he said . " Takes the nut off . And all your physical energies flower . I expect the old lady 'll be a hand-ful . " She glanced at Tom . She had thought that he was going to come out and take a seat on the terrace but he continued to stand silently in the doorway for a few minutes , then with a muttered " Good night " turned back into the hall . " You 're going to bed early , " she called . He did not answer . She heard his feet ascending the stairs and then the sounds were muted on the rugs of the upper hall and she heard his door close softly . Miller sighed and stretched luxuriously on his long chair . " This has been a beautiful day , " he said . " I looked out over the east field this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Tumbling ? " she said . " For joie de vivre . I wanted to catch it in a cup . . . . Elsie , have you ever eaten peacock ? " " No , " she said " Rodney tells me that in the old days that was the regulationSunday dinner around here . I suppose it 's more like a guinea than anything else . Dry , and a bit gamey . He says his mother bakes them to perfection . It seems that the Robinsons continued to have peafowl on their table long after the white people gave them up . When Rodney was a little boy there were a lot of old peafowls straggling around , did n't hardly know who they belonged to . " " I suppose that 's what became of the flock that used to belong here . I had to go up in Kentucky to get mine . " " I suppose so . Baked , " he repeated reflectively . " It would be sure to be dry . But there is no proper roasting these days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my peacocks , " Mrs. Manigaultsaid . " No . . oo . Well , there . are the guineas . I think I will teach Clara a new sauce . Did n't you think the guinea hen was a bit dry last night ? " " I did n't touch it , " she said . " I 'm dieting . " " I do n't know why . Your figure is perfect . " They were silent , watching the poplars throw their heavy spears of shadow across the rectangular sward . " Do you think Tom is really interested in that girl ? " she asked abruptly . " He is evidently much interested in her . But whether they contemplate marriage . . . " He gave the little sibilant laugh she had come to dislike . " I am no expert in affairs of the heart . " " You 're a man , " she said bluntly . " You ought to know something about how another man feels . She 's too old for him but I think he 's in love with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After all , Jim Chapman is a very distinguished man . " " But Tom has so much money . " She sat up straighter . " I happen to know that he has a note coming due at the First National Bank this month , " she said . " Why they keep on lending him the money is more than I know . . . . " " Feudal feeling . They like to see a Manigault farming Big Pond . " He sat up too and leaned towards her . " Elsie . . . " he said . Hearing his voice sink on her name she turned her head quickly , staring . " What ? " she asked . He swung his legs over and sat on the edge of the long chair . His hands , extended before him , the fingers a little curved in , seemed in the dusky light to suspend between them some fragile , invisible object . " Elsie , " he said , " why do n't you go away from here ? " " And turn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same low tone . " Yes , " he said eagerly . Her eyes were on the fragile , invisible shape that his hands enclosed . " What would I do then ? " she asked crisply and saw his hands sink slowly to his sides and in her fancy heard from the flagstones a brittle tinkle . " What would I do ? " she repeated . " You could go to New York . Take a pent-house apartment . Do something . . . . There are so many things you could do .... " " What ? " she reiterated . " God , woman , how do I know ? . . . You could start an art gallery . You could buy some pictures and open a small gallery . " " And you would tell me what pictures to buy ? " " Naturally . You could start with two or three . Unknowns . I know where to lay my hands on one now . There 's a Dutchmanliving on Hudson Street , a spiritual descendant of Seurat , and , mind you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just begun . This man understands Seurat . He understands Poussin , too . He 's got a new theory of Divisionism . God , Elsie , does n't that excite you ? " " No , " she said . " I do n't want a gallery . They would paint the pictures and you would tell me which ones to buy . I would n't have any part in it  --  except to furnish the money . " " The sinews of war . Is n't that enough ? " " No . I 've got to be doing something myself . " He was stretching himself back on his couch . " Women are all wrong nowadays , " he said . " You ought to be more like Isabella d'Este . . . or Vittoria Colonna . . . . I wonder that you 've never gone in for politics . " She pursued her own train of thought . " It must be my father in me . I 'm not happy unless I 'm doing something . " " I ca n't understand it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your daily bread it would be different , or if you were driven to create beautiful things , like this house which I called into being out of nothing , " he said with a proud wave of his white hand . " There are only two reasonable forms of effort : those that contribute to survival and those that contribute to art , which is a deeper form of survival . " " I was decorated by the French government for my work in the hospital , " she said .   " Naturally . You were handsome , energetic , rich , well-connected . " " They took the horses out and set me on the gun carriage and we paraded down the avenue . . . . " " There is nothing like war , " he said kindly . " We are all artists then . " She was silent , hardly hearing his words , thinking of the crisp , black , springing hairs that , except for the shaven areas surrounding the swollen , empurpled wounds , covered the whole body of Paul Bourdue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the men would not have him bathed first . Even old Raoul , whose lips murmured continually over the fingers tented over his chest  --  he said five hundred and eighty Hail Marys and six hundred Pater Nosters while he was in the hospital  --  even old Raoul when she came to his bedside would smile and ask if the basin contained fresh water . " I do not wish to catch his fleas , Madame . " And Paul 's black , Midi eyes would shine and he would maintain that he bred only lice , and one day when he caught one in the matted fur of his chest he held it up for all the ward to see . " A prize winning hog . Fattened in the Forest of Bourdue . " He always wanted her to bathe him . Sister Victorine could never learn to roll the sheet out right ... . " ... I do not wholly agree with Tolstoi . It is not merely the relief from moral responsibility . It is the escape from self . Every time man makes a sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . But you will have the opportunity again . It looks as if we were getting into the war . By February , I should say . . . . No , she said silently . No . There will never again be a time like that and I do not want it . I am not as young as I was , and I have a son . No , I do not want war .. . " ... And I think you pacifists , you women , are to some degree responsible for the present crisis . We have been feedingthe youth of the land lies , for a generation now . And when was youth ever anything but cannon fodder ? " he asked sadly . She stood up . " Have you a detective story in your room ? " " There 's an Agatha Christie on the table by the bed . And there are three or four in the bookcase . I recommend The Spider in the Cup which you will find on the third shelf from the bottom , third book in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Agatha Christie , " she said , " if you 're through with it . " " Oh , quite , " he said courteously . He stood up , too . As she passed him he bent and lightly kissed her cheek . She was gone . He stared into the doorway where her body had showed for a moment against the light . In the last few weeks he had fancied that she was beginning to look her age . She was as slim as ever , but she did not carry herself as buoyantly as she once had . She had stepped up into the doorway , heavily , like a person suddenly lifting a weight . Gravity , which all her movements had once seemed to defy , was tuggingat her . The flat thighs , the long , shapely legs , the small , round breasts had begun their long declension towards the earth in which they must eventually rest . He sighed and lit a cigarette and lay back on his couch . He thought : Women . . . they live longer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am glad I kissed her then . I am the only one to kiss her these days . And there will not beP229anybody after me . . . . He half closed his eyes and tried to summon her image as she had been when he first knew her . She is the woman I have come nearest to loving in my life , he thought , and I must try to remember her as she was , must try never to forget . It is little enough that we can do for each other in this life .. . He opened his eyes , disturbed by a sudden shifting of the light which poured from the broad facade of the house out on to the greensward . It fell just short of the trees that reared themselves at the end of the enclosure . The tall poplars rose out of a band of black shadow . But the shadow was turning gray . Some one walked behind the poplar boughs , carrying a light . He has finished his work , he thought , and now he is taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a marble faun or a fountain , at the end of an alley of pleached apple trees . In the daytime the grass under the trees would be molten with the interlaced , quivering shadows , but now the way was dark except for the beams cast by the flashlight . The man on the couch followed with his eyes the gleams flickering from bough to bough . The dark boy would have arrived at the end of the path . There were no more gleams of light . He had laid his flashlight down in the grass . He was bending to turn the handle which would release the metal door . His feet were planted wide apart . He bent lithely from the waist . Under his white houseboy 's coat his brown body was wet with sweat . He half rose from his long chair , then sank back . It always comes like this , he thought , after a time when I have had I1 peace and am lying in the sun and the forces that I thought had departed forever are rising in me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I did not feel quite enough power and I thought I would wait another day ... That has happened before , he thought wearily . It was Robert 's fault that I have not finished my book before this . I never worked better than I did at Nassau . I had the whole of the second section in my head ready to write down that morning . My manuscript was spread out . I was working by the tall window . Julio was arranging flowers on a table when Robert came in at the far door and shouted . It was a long room , but he need not have shouted so that Julio , going out by the other door , heard him . . . I never saw Julio again .. . When I think of that time now it is not Julio that I see but Robert , backed up against the wall , shouting . Two folds came at the corners of his mouth and kept drawing them down , and I thought how ugly he looked . I never thought until that moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have wanted him when Julio was there . How ugly he looked , backed up against the wall , shouting ! Deliberately he contemplated the image which for a time had been graven so sharply on his memory that he could never think of the moment without making some unconsciousgesture of revulsion . But the lines that fixed the grin of rage on Robert Askew 's face seemed stereotyped and withoutpower to move and the grin itself faded , leaving the features of his former partner smooth , youthful , impassive . He brought the leg which had been hanging over the chair up to lie beside its fellow . He folded his hands on his chest . I must go carefully , he thought . Elsie is my oldest friend . P231Tom is almost a son to me . I must go carefully . His thoughts formed themselves into words , but the words seemed to be spoken without conviction by some one standing at a great distance . He repeated them , striving to make them take on life . " I must go carefully . I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light was flickering on the poplar leaves again . " He is taking the pail back , " he thought . " He has set it on the steps , and has turned down into the basement . He is taking off his white coat and his dark trousers . He is standing there naked under the shower . . . . " He got up and walked to the end of the terrace . He hesitated , glancing back over his shoulder at the quiet house , then took the path that led between low box bushes to the latticed basement door . Upstairs Mrs. Manigault reached over and switched out the lamp beside her bed . As she lay quiet , her eyes closed , she became aware of a small throbbing in her arm . The cut she had got that morning when she backed suddenly against a strand of barbed wire was hurting again . She got up and went into the bathroom and took a bottle down from the cabinet . She poured a drop of iodine into the wound , then held her arm out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tiny furrow . I wo n't bandage it , she thought , cuts always get infected if you put iodine on them and then bandage them . She stood at the east window a moment in her long satin night dress , waiting for the iodine to dry so that it should not soil the sheet ; then , getting back into bed , pulled the blanket and a sheet up over her . The book she had been reading lay open , face down on the table . She hesitated , then picked it up and read a few pages . But the conversation going on between Poirot and Hastings did not hold her attention . She laid the book down and , stretching her body its full length , lay back upon the pillow , her head resting on her upraised , folded arms . She had been standing in the corner of the pasture , holding the bay mare on a slack bridle rein . She had not seen the white paper blow across the grass . Her eyes were on a group of colts at the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the corner of her eyes she had seen the white-stockinged foot flash forward and in the same instant had seen the lower lip gaping to reveal greenish , parted teeth . She had backed up against the fence , so suddenlythat the mare 's head had been jerked around . They had confronted each other . The mare was actually rearing when Joe Marble ran up . Standing close beside the mare he had grasped the bridle with his right hand while his left arm slid over the withers and down the back in a long , quieting caress . She had had the feeling that the little man , if he cared to , could have picked the mare up and set her clown in another quarter of the field . But he had been agitated . His eyes shone . He spoke harshly . " Do n't ever let her see you 're afraid of her , ma'am ! " The barb had gone so deep into her arm that she had had to have help from one of the negro boys before she could extricate herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she went over to stand beside him . " I was n't in the least afraid . She startled nre . " He stroked the mare 's quivering nose and spoke to herp233in his quiet voice before he let one of the boys lead her away . " No 'm , " he said , " but it ' us a bad idea , letting her back you up against the fence . " " I think I 'll have that barbed wire taken down , " she told him . He had agreed that barbed wire was responsible for a great many accidents and they had made plans to replace the old fence by one electrified wire . She had almost forgotten the incident in her interest in the new fence , but now , lying alone in the quiet room , it came to her as events of the day just lived through often come back in the night . In the dark she felt her face flushing and she set her teeth for a moment upon her lower lip . She had cut a ridiculous figure , hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rearing and about to lash out with her fore feet while all the stupid negroes stood staring . Her head groom was an under-sized , spare , dark man who moved unobtrusively , speaking seldom and always in a low voice . Until today she had never seen him agitated . But the face he had turned on her today was quick with anger  --  and accusation . She had had for a second the odd feeling that the anger had been there all along , that he would always have spoken to her in that harsh , authoritativevoice but for the patience that like rubber , coating fiery electric current , overlaid his every movement and his least utterance . " But he is always burning inside , " she thought . " That is why he handles the boys so well . He hardly ever gives them an order and always in that quiet tone , but they jump for him faster than they ever do for Tom . "  | He had had only one employer before he came to her : a Colonel Edward Andrews in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had worked for Colonel Andrews . " I started when I was four . Exercising the horses . They had a big nigger was so lazy he could n't hardly draw his breath and he 'd put a bitting rig on a horse and put me up and turn us loose on the track and every time we 'd come past him he 'd wake up and say , That 's right , son , keep on riding him ! ' Least , " he added , " that 's what my daddy said . He come down there one day and found me taking old Saint Blaze around and he went up to the house and told the colonel , See here , Colonel . You going to work my boy you ought to pay him . ' And the colonel give me a dime every Saturday . I remember that because I bought Long Jim ' with it , " he added reflectively , " and seems like I remember Old Blaze . But you know , I ca n't remember that nigger at all . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the way they told it . " She had gone to his house once at night , to consult with his wife about something . He had remained in his chair , reading The Breeder 's Gazette until the women had finished their talk , when he got up and came slowly towards her . " I do n't think we better . . . " he began and she knew he was referring to the breeding problem they had discussed earlier in the day . He had not thought of anything else during the interim . He did not ever think about anything but horses . He lived in a world in which horses were the only objects worthy of contemplation . When he relapsed into those periods of abstraction the negro grooms steppedp235softly about him , whispering to each other , " Do n't bother Mister Joe , he thinking , " but he was not pondering his financial condition or his domestic affairs , he was not wishingthat he had taken a job somewhere else or that she would pay him more money ; he was working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she had approached him with her offer of a house and garden and a wage of a hundred and fifty dollars a month he had looked abstracted and she had thought that the amount was not enough and was about to raise it when he said with a quick , dismissing wave of the hand , " You better talk to my wife about that .... You say you got a High Cloud brood mare ? " That is what it is to be an artist , she thought . Roy is always talking about how superior the artist is to the commonman , how everybody else is born for the whip . I wish I had been born like that . I wish I cared about some one thing more than anything else . But I have not ever really cared about any of the things I have done . . . . The furniturefactory . At first it seemed such a good idea and I liked the smell of the wood and I would go and stand beside old Mr. Naylor and watch the lathe turning and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and would call Mr. Naylor in and we would consult about how you could change the desk to make it fit into a space three by four and then one day that fat woman came in and we were looking at the desk and I saw her lip wrying and I thought , What is the use of making beautiful reproductions for them when they would rather have something from Grand Rapids ? And I did not tell Mr. Naylor for another month , P236but I knew I would have to sell all the equipment and find him another job . I could not go on with it . . . . Helen Turner says that I have never found my metier , that I ought to work with people . If I had started with one of the big department stores I could have a big executive position now , she says . . . . For a moment she saw herself seated behind a gleaming desk in the spacious , sun-lit office . A tall , dark young man stood in front of the desk , head slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began speaking , when he raised his head and looked keenly into her eyes , nodding his head at intervals . A young secretary , white frilled , in a dark dress , noiselessly manipulated a typewriter . But what would be the good , she thought ? It is only to make money and I have enough of that . . . . No , I had rather be here . It is the nearest I have ever come , the nearest . And you need not say that it does not make any difference , that you ought to be glad to have food and clothes and a roof over your head . You could do without them sooner . For it is the onlything that matters . . . . That is where all the years havegone . There would be the beginning and the excitement andI would think This is it . This is it , I would think , and I willnot change now but will go on with it , and then the deadfeeling would come and I would have to get out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you ca n't . And it is not the dead feeling but the time after when youknow you never can . And there is nothing to do . Sometimes I have had to leave a place and no reason to give . . . . But there is nowhere to go . . . . This is the nearest I have been . The dead feeling does not come and there are days when I forget who I am and I do not mind exercising the horsesP237when the boys do not show up or getting up at night with the colts . And there is so much to do yet . . . . But Roy says I ought not to stay , that Edward would not want me here . He never showed much affection for the place when he was alive , she thought with anger . He did not seem to care what became of it . It is not right to let a place run down the way this place was run down . I was needed here . That is why I came . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was living at the hotel and driving out early each morning and the men had started working and each day you could see a little change from the day before . It was all right till Tom came ... . He is your only child . But he is young . There are so many other things he can do . I will give him the money . This conflict is unnatural . He is all of flesh and blood you have . I have never had anything for myself . And now it is too late . It would be different if there had ever been anything for me . I could give it up to him then . It is not much , not what I looked forward to , but it is all I will ever get now . I can not give it up to him ... . She sat up in bed . The sounds whose existence she had for some minutes been unconsciously denying had grown louder . There was a single , loud exclamation and then a door closed belowstairs with a loud bang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare feet out into the hall . She leaned over the banister and called " Tom ! " There was the sound of feet sliding on a rug . His face , contorted with anger , showed at the bottom of the stair-well . " Aye God ! " he shouted , " you want to come down here ? "   She lay there quietly until she heard the taxi come up the drive . But after the front door had closed and the house was quiet she got up and walked about the room and finally paused in front of her father 's portrait that , in a heavy silver frame , sat always on her desk . He sat on a marble bench , in spring sunshine , the trunk of an oak dark behind him , wearing a suit of rough gray tweed . A bird dog lounged up against him , one paw on his knee . The man sat , a little turned away from the dog , from the spectator , his thin hands , whose mottles of brown she could remember , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of a cigar . She remembered the day that Sutton , a photographerfamous for his studies of men , had come out to take this picture of Papa , at her request . He had posed him among his papers , among his books , beside a statue , under a Bronzino portrait of a duke , " everywhere , " the old man had said with his dry laugh , " except at the piano , " and finally had taken him out to this bench in the garden . The clog had come ru : Ling up . Eph Cottar , relaxing , about to light a cigar , had thrust a foot out to ward him off . But the photographer had called out for him to let the dog stay and had taken the picture in that instant . He had done well . The handsome cloth , veiling the shrunken limbs , the white marble of the bench , the dog whose pose might signify affection , the silver hair , all had combined to present to the world the picture of an old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trivial task . If he had turned his head you would have seen in a face , so narrow that it might have been drawn with two strokes of a child 's crayon , deep-setP241eyes , still glowing coldly at seventy , a pinched nose , a mouth as thin and cruel as a carp 's . As a small child she had been a little afraid of her father 's gaze , of his sudden , too wide smile , but familiarity had dulled the first keen impressions . When she came to adolescence and found that she could deceive him , could even impose her will upon him , she had developed an amused affection for him , an affection that had increased after her marriage . He was , she told herself now , the only person who had ever really loved her and she paused before the silent figure and , extending her hands , whispered , " What shall I do ? " He did not answer . Elsie Manigault was his only legitimate issue . The other child , a son , was a mulatto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuffled out along the river front , his death from a bullet that a sheriff had meant for another man , all fated , set in train by the moment when a group of young men hesitated at the corner of two snowy , ill-lit streets until the whisper , " Dark meat 's cheaper , " sent them up the nearest rickety wooden steps . Eph Cotter did not know of this son 's existence and would not have cared to know about it . That had been a careless , unguarded hour , one of the few he had ever known in his life . Until he was past forty he had had no time for either marrying or whoring , being already dominated by the lust which first took whole possession of him when he was nineteen years old , on the same morning that the Butztown Rifles marched past his father 's store on their way to the railway cars that would take Lhem to Manassas Junction . His father , a mild ox of a man with perpetually troubled blue eyes , had stared at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ai n't you going , Eph ? " he had asked . Eph , stepping back out of the sunlight and feeling harsh , laden cloth rubbing against his bare chest  --  the canvas bag his mother had sewed for him at the beginning of the summer , held six silver dollars ; three hundred more were hidden under his mattress  --  Eph had not troubled to answer , only turned on the man his cold , abstract gaze . In imagination he had already quitted his father 's roof and was sitting among piles of ill-smelling hides in Charlie Schrader 's warehouse , engaged in the interviewthat would make him manager and part owner of the tannery . That same tannery that from now on would be so mysteriously and persistently mismanaged that Charlie Schrader , frustrated by the strange disorder of the accounts to which he finally got access by candle-light and despairing at the last of a long train of reverses would end his life with a bullet . " He was the only one and now he is gone , " she whispered . " What shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes to the portrait . He did not turn . He did not answer . She was the child of his middle years . He had not married until he was fortyfive , but even when she was born he had been too wise for such questions . Not with the wisdom of the imagination that comes sometimes to men in their youth , to an Heraclitus , a Buonarotti , a Leonardo , but with the wisdom of an old , tired organism ; of the old possum that lies all night in its hole rather than drag its crippled leg over the snow to the henhouse , of the hawk that , discerning with fading eyes the flash of wings through the leaves , yet clings to its perch onP243the dead pine , preferring the faint pain of hunger which it has had for a long time and will have until it drops shrivelled from the bough , to the agony of the moment when , havingstruck and missed , it must beat upward through empty blue . P244WHEN WILLY LEFT THE HOTEL at seven o'clock the squarewas already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain had fallen in the afternoon . Puddles of water stood in the concrete ; the grasses that thrust up beside the sidewalks were beaded with moisture . Willy hesitated on the steps , then went back upstairs and got the sofa pillow that she had brought from Swan Quarter and thrust it under her arm . She would need it in the grandstand : the seats were sure to be damp . Mr. Shannon had wanted her to sit in a box , with a Mr. and Mrs. Proctor from Lewisburg , but she had told him that she preferred the grandstand . The sidewalk ended . She crossed a muddy road and set foot on the lighted common . The crowd , which had surged so compactly along the walk , was scattering . People stopped to talk with friends or hurried purposefully towards the ring . On the littered grass two boys were wrestling . She watched her own shadow waver ahead of her and fall across the moving bodies and thought that it looked gaunt and lonely . She came to the tall elms that guarded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when she made to open her purse for her pass they stayed her with a genial wave of the hand . She slipped through the turnstile and was in the narrow , sawdust-covered lane between the tiers of seats . In the bright space ahead figures moved slowly , came to a stop . The two-year-old fillies were lining up before the judges ' P245stand . At seven-thirty the two-year-old walking stallion class would be called . Without a glance at the fillies , she hurried along at the foot of the stands . Box three , where Mr. Shannon had wanted her to sit , was full of people . The small woman in the red hat was probably Mrs. Proctor . The woman , standing with her back turned , talking to her , looked more citified , in a dark gray suit and small purple hat . She was turning around . From under the brim of the purple hat blue eyes swept the crowd . She was turning back , smiling , to say something to the other woman . Willy dodged behind a stout man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body as a shield between her and the occupants of the box . The man was pausing at the command of the woman who was with him . They seemed about to take some vacant seats in the first row . Willy hurried on . At any moment Mrs. Manigault might see her and call to her . The stout man caught up with her . He and his wife had decided against the first row seats . They stopped and began climbing towards some seats in the top row . She climbed with them . " If she sees me now , all I have to do is wave , " she thought . " I could n't get down to her over all those people . " The stout man 's wife was putting a layer of newspapers down on the damp boards . She saw Willy 's sofa pillow and smiled . " You were smarter than I was , " she said . A woman next to her was jogging her arm . She turned and , recognizinga friend , began an animated conversation . Willy stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty now of horses . Merry Girl from the Cherryvale Stock Farm had won in the walking filly class . Two figuresp245had left the judges ' stand and were strolling over the turf . There would be an intermission before the next class came in . She hoped it would not be long and for the moment regretted her anonymity . It would be nice to have somebody to talk to while you were waiting . Not all the time , just while you were waiting . Yesterday Red had won the Two-Year-Old Futurity and had also won in the Two-YearOldStallion class . Mr. Shannon had refused to become excited . Today would tell the tale , he said . Today he was showing in the All-Age . Some people might think they were fools to enter a two-year-old in the All-Age , but he was going to do it . . . . " There ai n't anything here that can touch him . But I do n't like that Joe Polk . . . . " Joe Polk was from Lewisburg , and therefore , according to Mr. Shannon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thinking they got all the horse flesh . They 're not going to take to a Pennyry'al horse  --  if they can help it . " A man had been talking , in a great voice , about bonds . He stopped . The megaphone began a sharper pleading : " Will the judges come to the arena ? ' Will the judges come to the arena ? We want to give you a good show . " Two figures broke from the group in front of the boxes and started across the turf . The man in the light-colored raincoat had been pointed out to her earlier in the day as Joe Polk . He was a lawyer in Lewisburg , with a good practice , and had a farm four miles out of town . He had bred last year 's winning stallion , Yellow Boy . Mr. Shannon did n't think so much of Yellow Boy . He came of western stock . Did n't have as much of the old Black Allen in him . The two men , at the foot of the judges ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One brought his clenched fist down lightly on his palm . The other threw his head back . If you had not been so far away you could have heard him laugh . The figures disappeared up the little stairway . The megaphone ceased bawling . The stallions had passed through the east gate . They were coming around the curve now , slowly . A black in the lead , a gray behind him . You could not see Red yet . The stout man leaned forward . " Twenty-two , " he said , " that 's Bill Rives ' horse . " " I like the gray , " his wife said . " O000h , look at his tail ! " " Too showy , " the man said , " got stringy shoulders . " " It 's just like a waterfall , " the wife said . " John , how do they get their tails to stand up like that ? " " Cut the muscles . . . . Twenty-two . That 's Bill 's horse . " The black horse walked slower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever so little from side to side . Each time his left forefront sought the ground it was with a proud curve . " Ai n't he got a nice nod ? " the man said . " Nice action all over . " The black had passed . The gray 's head was small , but he was well ribbed . His tail , set higher than those of the other horses , sprayed his dappled rump with silver . . . . A dark red muzzle was blotting out the silver plumes . Willy looked once at the thrusting shoulders , at the brim of Mr. Shannon'sbroad , black hat , then looked away , up the line to where the black had come to a stop in front of the judges . " You think that black 's the best horse ? " she asked in a low voice . The stout man threw away the stump of his cigar and bent towards her . " Yes , ma'am , " he said when she had re- peated the question . " That 's the best stallion here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman reached over and extended a sack half full of peanuts . " I hope the gray wins , " she said . " He 's got such a beautiful tail . " Reverse and canter , please ! Reverse and canter , please ! The megaphone had bawled twice before the horses turned and started back . The gray was in the lead now and next to him the chestnut , then Red . . . . And if he wins , Catherine said , it 'll be on his walk . His canter 's choppy ... . Who wants to canter , Mr. Shannon asked , when they got this fast walk ? I 'd a had Miss Catherine show this horse if she was n't a lady . You put a lady up and half the time the judges are looking at the lady , they ai n't looking at the horse . . . . Go on , Mr. Shannon . It 's because I do n't ride well enough . . . . You got a nice , light hand . . . . But no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ai n't no lady , hardly , got a grip in her legs . I wish I weighed fifty pounds less . But I 'll ride him as light as I can ... . Will the riders please put their horses to the walk ? Will the riders please put their horses to the walk ? I have to look now , I have to look . If I do n't he may not win . . . . That boy knows how to handle the black ... . I 'll ride as light as I can . . . . He does look smaller , up . Maybe it 's the broad-brimmed hat , or the gray trousers . He 's holding him in a little . That 's for the nod . . . . Red , he do n't nod as much as some . . . . But his shoulders shine so red in the light ! . . . From the hoof up , he said . They judge from the hoof up . . . . The Allen walk is pretty . Eachp249time you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he had a longer reach he 'd caulk himself . His reach is longer than the black 's , and he walks faster , and he 's got better shoulders . . . . She tried to catch the glance of the bright , dark eye that as he passed her strained a little backwards in its socket . . . . You never walked sweeter , Red ! They can give the prize to whoever they want ... . You never walked sweeter ... . The megaphone had been bawling for a long time . Or had it just started ? The stout man brought his clenched fist down on the planks . " I 'm a monkey , " he said , " I 'm teetotallya monkey . " His wife was laughing . " Long as the gray did n't get it I 'm glad it was the chestnut . " " It was the chestnut , was n't it ? " Willy whispered . " He did say the chestnut ? " The man looked at her curiously . " Yes , ma'am . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pump . " He stood up . " I 'm going down and see what pill has to say . I bet he 's rearing . " He looked over to where the stallions were cantering , one by one , through the gate . " He does move nice , that chestnut , " he said . Willy took the program that she had torn in two and arranged the pieces neatly on her lap . " I thought he seemed a little nervous , " she said . When they had gone she sat still for a moment , then climbed down and made her way through the crowds to the owners ' quarters . Red had already been rubbed down and blanketed and stood with his head thrust over the gate of his stall , his ears pricked forward , watching the moving ,   wooden horses of a brightly lighted merry-go-round . Speakingsoftly , she went up and stood beside him . He jerked his head to one side and nibbled at her sleeve . She gave him the apple she had bought for him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his swift crunching , he let a half fall to the ground , she picked it up and held it flat on her palm for the eager lips to snuff up . " No doctoring the horses , ma'am ! " a voice said . Mr. Shannon was standing in the door of the tack room . He stepped out , and slipping his hand under her elbow , assisted her over the sill . Two men who had been sitting on a long , tarpaulin-covered box in the corner , stood up . " This here 's the lady that owns Red Allen , " Mr. Shannon said . The two men took their hats off and laid them on the box . " You sure got a horse , Ma'am , " one of them said . He picked his hat up and moved towards the door . " I understandBill Rives ai n't feeling so good , " he said and emitted a short laugh . " I have to laugh when I think about these Lewisburg folks , " he explained . " I 'm from Marshall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken down . They get to thinking they 're the only folks can breed walking horses . I like to see a horse come in from outside every now and then . " He paused and held a thick forefinger up , " But not too often , lady , " he said , " you do n't want to do it too often . " " We 'll win the Grand Championship next year , " Mr. Shannon said . The two men laughed and disappeared through the doorway.  | " Grand Champion Walking Stallion of the World , " Mr. Shannon said softly . " That 'll be old Red . Next ' year . " " Grand champion , " Willy said faintly . She had sat down on the box and now she moved a little forward so that her feet rested on the ground . The sawdust that covered it gave off a clean , pleasant smell . It was striped by the long pearshapedshadow of the single electric light bulb that dangled naked from the ceiling . The pale shadow was swallowed up by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that separated the box from Red 's stall . A nail had come loose ; one of the boards was sagging . Red had thrust his nose through the aperture and was pushing at the board . It flopped up and down , creaking . Red 's whole head appeared in the opening . His dark eyes shone . He tossed his head up and down lightly . She got up and , laying the palm of her hand flat against his nose , pushed his head back . " Bad boy , " she said , " you 're a bad boy . " Mr. Shannon had come up behind her . He looked about for a tool and when he could find none slipped the board back into its place and hammered on it with his fist . " I 'll have that fixed tomorrow , " he said . She had stepped out of the box and was looking over the gate into the shining eyes . " He seems sort of nervous tonight , " she said . " The crowd bothers him , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's a lot better'n he was yesterday . I had to water him myself yesterday . That boy could n't manage him . "   " Did he cut up ? " " Reared a little . " He tested the fastening of the gate . " He 'll be all right , soon as we 're gone , " he said . " Stallions always got to be nibbling something . . . Miss Willy , what say we go and get something to eat ? " " I saw Elsie Manigault in one of the boxes a little while ago , " she told him as they walked down the lane . " Marble did n't come , " he said . " I reckon he knew that filly of theirs was n't going to show up so well . He did n't much want to show her , but Mrs. Manigault was set on it . " " Did n't she win ? " Willy asked . " I did n't even watch the filly class . But I thought she was sure to win . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . He laughed . " I 'd liked to a seen Mrs. Manigault 's face when they give Red the ribbon . " They were on the mid-way . At this time of night it was crowded with people . Mr. Shannon suddenly stopped and , bowing slightly , offered her his arm . She laid her hand on it . He turned so that he walked a little ahead of her and made a way for them through the crowd . He paused beforethe tent which housed " Fatima , Queen of Fortune Tellers . " " Want to go in ? " he asked . She shook her head , smiling . They walked on . After a little he stopped again and , getting out his handkerchief , mopped his forehead . " It was along here , " he said , " that place Joe told me about was along here somewhere . " They crossed the street and joined a line of people standing in front of a pavilion which advertised " Sizzling Steaks  --  Short Orders . " Inside the tent customers sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were being cookedP253on electric grills . Mr. Shannon led her past the counter into an adjacent tent where people sat at tables covered with red-and-white-checked cloths . He sat down with a sigh . " This is the place , " he . ; aid . A negro boy was at his elbow . " You got any draught beer ? " Mr. Shannon asked . " Sure have , Cap 'm , " the boy said . Mr. Shannon looked at Willy . " Miss Willy , you like draught beer ? " Willy laughed nervously . " I do n't know , " she said , " I never tasted beer . Yes , I did , once . Jack had some in the refrigerator and I tasted it . I thought it tasted bitter . " Mr. Shannon laughed . " Ladies do n't usually like beer , " he said . " How about some lemonade ? " " Yes , " Willy said , " I 'd like some lemonade . " " Ai n't got no more lemons , " the boy said sadly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Have you got any oranges ? " " And a steak ? " Mr. Shannon said . " I was too nervous to eat much dinner tonight . I 'm going to have me a good steak . You have one ? " She shook her head . " Got some nice chicken sandwiches , " the boy said . " I 'll take a chicken sandwich , " she told him , " and a glass of orangeade . " The steak , flanked by a mound of cole slaw and thick , brown slices of fried potatoes , was set before Mr. Shannon . He did not speak while he was eating . Willy nibbled her sandwich and drank her orangeade , gazing about her . The place had seemed crowded when they entered but more peo-P254ple were coming in . A slim , middle-aged woman in black came past , attended by three men . She stood for several minutes , steadying herself with a gloved hand resting lightly on the back of Willy 's chair , while her cavaliers secured the last table left in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air for several minutes after she had gone . Outside it was still cool , but this air was warm and weighted with sounds and scents . From the four corners of the tent powerful , shaded electric light bulbs cast a glow on the flushed faces , on the red and white checks of the table cloths . Glass steins of beer stood on every table . Some people had bowls of ice before them and empty glasses into which they poured whiskey from bottles which they took from their pockets . The bottles , Willy noted , were never allowed to stand up straight after the whiskey had been poured but were laid clown flat on the table or returned to the men 's pockets . When she had first come in she had felt uneasy . She had never been in a speakeasy before . She had imagined that such places , in this part of the world , at least , were patronized only by men . But there were women here , too , respectable women , most of them better dressed than she herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two beaux . She divided her time scrupulously between them , tilting her tawny head to flash a wide smile at one , or turning and with chin cupped in hand gazing dreamily at the tableclothwhile the other spoke in a low voice . Willy stared covertly at the girl , at the cloud of hair shading the brow , at the dropped lids which shone a little as if touched with some emollient , at the fashionably hollow cheeks , and tried to imagine what the man was saying toP255her . She was filled with lonely , impotent anger . She looked away . The woman in black was telling a story . Her three escorts fixed her face with bright , amused eyes . When she had finished , one of them put his arm about her shoulders in a quick , affectionate squeeze . " Lucy , you ought to be ashamed of yourself ! " A man at the next table turned as if he thought he had been addressed and gave him a friendly smile . The group at each table seemed self-contained but all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth if they had been so minded . And they were not strangers to her . In a sense they were her lifelong companions . All her life she had stood , alone , listening to the sounds of their merriment float out from behind a closed door . But why ? she asked herself . Why was it always like that ? How am I different from them ? Mr. Shannon had finished his steak and was ordering another stein of beer . " You wo n't change your mind , Miss Willy ? " he asked . " Yes , " she said suddenly , " I 'd like some beer . " The boy brought the beer in a mug frosted as white as a julep glass . She raised it to her lips . As she had expected it tasted bitter . She took a long swallow and set the mug down . Mr. Shannon leaned forward . His pale eyes studied her face . " Miss Willy , " he said , " how 'd you like to take Red to Shelbyville ? " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . Next year . " " He 's eligible now , " he said quietly . " He 's won in the All Age . The entries do n't close till Saturday . . . If I 's to get a letter off tonight ... " P256She lifted the stein and took another draught of the beer , then set the stein down , swallowing quickly , to get the bitter taste out of her mouth . " All right , " she said . She stood up . " Let 's go back to the hotel now and get the letter off . " Mr. Shannon laughed . " That 's the right spirit , " he said . She had already started on . She was in the outer tent beforeshe realized that he had stayed behind to pay the bill . She felt conspicuous , standing alone . She went outside and stood in the street . The lights were not so brilliant now . Many of the shows had closed for the night . A little way down the street a group of people stood before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Come and see the couple being married in the block of ice ! " " The Grand Championship , " she thought , " the Grand Championship of the World ! " Mr. Shannon was beside her , his hand cupped under her elbow . They moved forward . He hesitated as they came abreast of the striped tent and looked up at the sign . " Married in a block of ice ! " he said . " I would n't like that much , now , would you , Miss Willy ? " " I do n't think they ought to allow it , " she said and would have passed on but his hand compelled her to turn with the crowd . " Let 's just go in and see ' em , " he said , " We been so taken up we hardly seen anything yet . " His voice boomed out , suddenly genial . " Why , we hardly been to the Fair yet ! " They passed , with the crowd , through the gate . In the centre of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pink roses , the man and woman lay , P257in a glass case that was enclosed in a long block of ice . One saw the groom first . His black hair , parted on the side , plastered his bony skull slickly . He had a cape jessamine in his button-hole . Willy looked down at the sawdust under her feet . It was perfectly dry . " The ice does n't melt , " she thought . " But of course . They drain it off . Under the case somewhere . " Mr. Shannon 's hand , under her arm , propelled her faster . " Let 's look at the little lady , " he said . The coarse , white veil was long , to hide the scantiness of the white satin robe . In its voluminous folds the yellowhairedbride lay as unstirring as one of those nosegays which florists at Valentine time enclose in stiff , white lace paper . Under half-closed lids the blue glare of her eyes was directed at the opposite wall . Her full , rouged lips parted to reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper lip showed yellowish in the harsh light . The hand which clasped the bouquet of gladioli and ferns to the breast was plump , the skin reddened and coarse in texture , the short fingers ending in sharply curved nails , ornamented with blood-red discs . " I do n't like to lock at them , " Willy said in a low voice , and wondered if they could hear anything through the glass . " They got in there themselves , " Mr. Shannon told her . " We did n't put them in there . They got in there of their own free will . " But he hurried with her to the turnstile where a loud speaker proclaimed that each day at ten , twelve , two and four o'clock the Reverend Albert Miles would perform the double-ring marriage ceremony .   " I knew a couple was married on horse-back once , " Mr. Shannon said . " Walking horses at that . Seemed like a lot of foolishness to me . " His hand closed firmly on the upper part of her arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked back . The groom 's face was visible through a gap between the heads . When they had come in he had been staring straight before him . But now in the pallid skull an eye moved , sending its dark , oblique glance out over the crowd . A pulse beat in the temple . The dark , straining , hostile eye met hers for an instant , then travelled on to rest on the tent wall . She turned her head quickly and plunged with the crowd out on to the street . Mr. Shannon took out his handkerchief and wiped , first , his forehead , then the fingers that had been clasping her arm . Well , now , that was n't much , was it ? " he asked . " Seems like they had better side shows when I was a boy . " " When I was a child I could never bear to look at the freaks , " she said faintly . " A bearded lady or something like that , " Mr. Shannon said , " Or a dog-faced boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy used to come every fall to the Montgomery county stock show . . . But a couple laying up in a block of ice ! That ai n't nothing . " They came to an open space before a merry-go-round . " Now that 's what I like , " Mr. Shannon said . " My old daddy never could understand that . Why' n't you ride a tobacco stick ? ' he 'd ask me . But he 'd give me a quarter to ride on . Least , he 'd turn my own money over to me . . . . I startedP259working in the field when I was eight years old , Miss Willy . By the time I was fifteen I had me a hundred dollars saved up . Willy 's eyes followed the prancing wooden horses . " I like the white one , " she said . She laughed merrily . " Look ! His tail 's set . " The machine was coming to a stop . The operator saw them and stepped quickly down to the lower platform . " Five cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ride ! " He caught a stirrup and dangled it at them , smiling invitingly . Willy hung back . " We 'd better go on to the hotel , " she said . " We 've got that letter to write . " They walked on . Mr. Shannon suddenly stopped and stood with his head tilted back , gazing . " Now , that 's what I like ! " he cried . Willy gazed too . Light glittered on the steel baser of the Ferris wheel but higher up the supporting framework was hardly visible . The gondolas , each curve outlined in pulsing light , might have climbed of their own accord into the dark blue sky , to sway as gently to and fro as lilies in a pond . " Let 's go up , " Mr. Shannon said . " I wo n't hardly feel I been to the Fair till I been on the wheel . " He paid their fares . They stood , waiting , while the great wheel slowly elevated the cars which were already occupied . An empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The car mounted slowly . The swaying motion , which had been almost imperceptible at first , increased as the wheel settled to its journey . The night air was lively with the cries of those left behind . Willy looked down . The upturned facesP26o had grown smaller . The cries which had been so various were all one cry . She felt herself growing a little dizzy and looked steadfastly before her . They had left the tallest of the buildings behind . In the dark sky only the radio tower showed its red and green lights . She turned her head so that it should be out of her range of vision , wanting no companion except the cool air and the dark . Mr. Shannon moved closer to her . He pointed . " That 's where we ate supper . " She looked down . The double string of electric lights glowed brilliantly on each side of the midwaybut the tents looked flat and dark . The people were still in there , eating , drinking , calling out to each other . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The eyes of the suppers would be glazed , their faces flushed from the beer and whiskey . She lifted her head and felt the air strike cold on her cheeks . Red Allen , by Roan Allen out of Miss Fancy . At Stud . Twenty-five dollars . They always charged at least twenty-five dollars for service . By January she would have enough money to buy a brood mare . There would be colts to raise . She would keep one . Just one colt . For her very own .. . " Everything looks mighty small , do n't it ? " Mr. Shannon asked . Theirs was now the topmost car . The swaying had increased . The gondolas wanted to leave the wheel and rocket down on to the dark plain . She felt her stomach draw inwardsharply and turned her head agitatedly to the right . Mr. Shannon put his arm about her shoulders . " Do n't look down , " he said . " Do n't look down now . " Willy sat rigid . The slight nausea passed . The car hadP261begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plump woman in the blue dress still stood with her face upturned , her eyes , blue and hard as marbles , glittering in the light . Somewhere behind her a child was crying . A black-haired man in overalls , who had been leaning against a telephone pole , suddenly straightened up and , taking a red handkerchief out of his pocket , began to wave it , laughingfrantically . He will take his arm away in a minute , she thought . It would be better if I did n't sit up so straight . Men always put their arms around girls on the Ferris wheel . She tried to relax her muscles . Mr. Shannon responded by leaning closer and tightening his arm about her shoulders . She could hear his hoarse breathing . The heavy body was warm against hers . He had actually moved over a little on the seat . His clasp was no longer impersonal but intimate . His fingers moved , gently caressing the back of her neck . The car was coming to a stop . He drew her close in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in overalls , disregarding the operator 's warning , jumped up on the platform . From the gondola behind a baby was handed down to him . Willy and Mr. Shannondescended and walked out into the crowd . " We might as well go back to the hotel , I reckon , " Mr. Shannon said . " Got to get that letter off . " Willy , walking with her head slightly bent , did not answer . She could not look up . The blood that had rushed to her cheeks had not subsided . She could feel it throbbing almost angrily . And she had been seized by an uncontrollabletrembling . " If I can just get back to the hotel , "   she thought , " I 'll tell him the Ferris wheel made me sick . I 'll get him to fill out the entry by himself . " They passed through the turnstile and walked across the common . A procession of automobiles held the road . They had to wait several minutes before they could cross . The sidewalks were crowded . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They moved forward swiftly , skirting the crowd . In the hotel they got the entry blanks from the clerk and turned into the ladies ' parlor . Mr. Shannon drew a chair out from before a little black desk . She shook her head and moved to the window . " You write it , " she said . " You can do it better than I can . " " All right , " he said . But he did not sit down at the desk . He stood , holding the papers in his hand , then suddenly thrust them down into his pocket and took a step towards her . " Miss Willy . . . " he said . The blood had ebbed from her cheeks . The trembling had ceased . She fixed her eyes on his face . " What is it , Mr. Shannon ? " He looked at the floor . His head turned slowly to one side . The muscles of his lips twitched . The lips themselves pursed , as if they found the words he was about to utter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply , like a man beset by bees . " Miss Willy , " he said , " you know what I mean ! " She continued to regard him calmly . " Is it something about Red ? " He came nearer . " It 's not only the horse , " he said , " butP263it looks like we 've got a lot in common , living neighbors and all . " He thrust both hands into his coat pockets and balancing on his toes inclined his heavy body a little while his gray eyes held hers . " Miss Willy , I 'd be a happy man if you 'd marry me . " " I could n't , " Willy said quickly . " I  --  I wish I could . But I could n't . " There was a silence . His gaze sharpened . " The old lady wo n't like it , " he said . " I know that . But she wo n't live forever . You got to remember that , Miss Willy . " Her face was flaming . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shannon . It 's not Mama ... " She had started forward and now she was directly opposite him . Her hand , anguished , groping almost as if she were blind , reached out and for a second lingered on his . " I ca n't explain . But I could n't . . . It 's no use to discuss it . " He had turned as she moved and kept his eyes fixed earnestly on her face . When his look grew more intent she lifted her hand swiftly from his , pressed it against her throat . " Please , Mr. Shannon . . . " she said . " I reckon not , " he said heavily . She was at the door . He took another step towards her . " Miss Willy . . . " She turned around . " I 'm not in the notion of marrying , just to be marrying , " he said . " You realize that , do n't you ? " " Yes , " she said faintly . " I just wanted you to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever to change your mind ... " She shook her head . Her hand went out to him in another , impotent , distracted gesture . He suddenly laughed .   His own hand , going down into his pocket , brought up the entry blanks . " You go on upstairs , " he said . " I 'll ' tend to these . " She left the parlor and crossed the lobby . In the elevator the boy was dozing . She tiptoed past him and walked up the single flight of stairs to her room . She turned on the light , took off her hat and jacket and sat down on the bed . The dresser was directly opposite . The woman framed in the oval mirror sat unnaturally straight on the side of the bed . Her breast rose and fell with her hard breaths and the eyes in the darkly flushed face glittered . Willy looked into the eyes for a second , then , with an hysterical laugh , fell to one side , burying her face in the counterpane . The pillow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth surface . I left it on the stands . But what does it matter ? She went to the window and stood looking down into the street , empty now of all save a few late strollers , then , slowly , languidly , undressed and got into bed . The bed faced the window . She lay quiet , staring at the sill washed white by light from the street below . In her imagination the words that had been exchanged in the parlorstill sounded , louder than at the moment of utterance . I 'd be a happy man if you 'd marry me . He had kept himself from moving forward by thrusting his hands deep into his pockets but all the while he was speaking his body had slowly inclined towards hers . And his gray eyes had had a strange shine . That was because they had been fixed so intently on her face . People look at each other a hundred times a day but it is seldom that any one regards you intently . It is so seldom that any one has anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be conveyed by the eyes . By the eyes , if you are not close enough to touch each other . It was not accidental , there , on the Ferris wheel ... A happy man if you 'd marry me . . . He is a gentleman  --  Ido n't care what they say  --  he is a gentleman . If I had moved , made the least sign , he would have taken his arm away or kept it there so lightly that I would not have felt it . But I did not move . I did not make any sign . So he moved closer . He must have felt me trembling when his hand touched my neck . That was why he hugged me to him just before we got off . And in the parlor , when we first came in , he thought that I would understand , that he would n't have to put it into words . But I stood there , pretendingI did n't understand him . That was when his look changed . But he did not go away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so he kept on looking at me . Then he was convinced . He turned away . I felt as if I were about to die . . . Do n't go on waiting for me . You are too good , too kind . Go on and marry somebody else . I could not say it but I stretched out my hand . It was all there , throbbing in my fingertips . But he had stopped looking at me . He was already gone away .. . A good thing . You never had any idea of marrying Quent Shannon . It would be unkind to trifle with his affections . ... When he first put his arm around me , there , on the Ferris wheel it was just to hold me in the seat . Men always put their arms around girls on the Ferris wheel . And it was just that at first , his arm steady and light about my shoulders , and then his hand came up and he waited a second and when I did not say no his hand slipped down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close , warm feeling and only us two , high up in the air , where nobody else could come . . . It is not too late . I could change my mind . . . Miss Lewis . Miss Wilhelmina Gates Lewis . No , Mrs. Shannon ... . Quentin Durward Shannon . His father was reading Quentin Durward the night he was born . Quent can read too . He got as far as the eighth grade .. . She had been lying on her back , still breathing short , hard breaths and now her mouth felt dry . She ran her tongue over her lips and turned over on her side and lay looking out of the window . The knock came again . She sat up in bed , staring . She realized now that this was the second time it had come . But he ought not to come to my room , she thought . Somebodywill come by , somebody will see him . She leaped from the bed and , catching up the robe she had flung on a chair , drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembling fingers , went to the door . " Who is it ? " she asked in a low voice . " Mrs. Manigault , " a voice said , " Elsie Manigault .. . Willy , you are n't in bed ? " Willy slowly opened the door . Elsie Manigault entered . She cried out when she saw Willy in her dressing gown . " Oh , my dear , I 'm so sorry ! The clerk told me you 'd just gone up . I thought you could n't be asleep . . . I 've been trying to get you all day . . . " " It 's all right , " Willy said . " I 'd just got in bed . I was n't asleep . " She would have turned on the light but her visitor withP267a gesture dissuaded her . " I ca n't stay a minute , " Elsie Manigaultsaid but she let Willy remove a heap of underclothing and sat down in the only chair . Willy sat down on the edge of the bed , drawing her robe a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get here ? " she asked after a pause in which her visitor had not spoken . " This afternoon . I came straight to the hotel but you 'd gone to the ring . Then I dined with the Powells and by the time I got back here you were gone again . . . " " Is everything all right at home ? " Willy asked . Mrs. Manigault made a vague gesture with her gray gloved hand . " Really . . . Catherine has treated us shamefully . She has n't been to see us since you left . " " I expect she 's pretty busy , " Willy said . Finding that she was trembling again she swung her feet up on the bed and slipped down inside the covers , drawing them up almost to her chin . " I 'm sort of tired , " she said , " sitting in that grandstand all day . . . Cousin Elsie , I was sorry I did n't see your filly show . She won second place , did n't she ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag of bones from Fayette county took second . Really , these judges ! . . . " She took her cigarette case out and after extending it perfunctorilytowards Willy , lit a cigarette . " I was delighted to hear that Red won in the stallion class , " she said . " Joe was amazed . He did n't think he ought to be shown this year . " " Catherine told me , " Willy said . " He did n't think he was filled out enough , she said . " " He was a little worried about his manners , too . You know , Willy , if you are going to keep on showing him you ought to have some competent advice . . . " " If I keep on showing him ? " Willy repeated . " Why , he 's just started , Cousin Elsie . " Mrs. Manigault laughed . " I realize that . But you might not keep on showing him yourself . You might sell him . Had you ever thought of that ? " Willy stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face looked drawn . Her vivacity masked a nervous intentness . She is talking as if we were friends , Willy thought , as if she came often to Swan Quarter . But we have never been friends . Why has she come here now ? And then she reminded herself that Mrs. Manigault was always polite , even gracious to everybody . But it was the abstracted , impersonal graciousness of careful breeding . Her graciousness tonight was a little exaggerated . She has only come because she wants something , Willy thought . She wants Red ! He is all I have and she knows it and wants to take him away from me . But she can not have him . If I ca n't have anything else I 'll have him . I wo n't sell him . No matter what they offer . I wo n't sell him . Aloud she said , " I 'm never going to sell Red , Cousin Elsie . " " Never ? " Mrs. Manigault asked lightly . " In that case you really ought to get some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any way he can , of course . But it 's tough going , for a woman alone . " " Mr. Shannon 's a good man with horses , " Willy said . " At least that 's what everybody around here has always thought . "   " He used to be a jockey , did n't he ? " " Yes . " " Well , times have changed . . . You really mean that , Willy ? " she asked suddenly . " You do n't want to sell ? " She stood up . She approached the bed . " I 'll give you ten thousand dollars , " she said in a low voice . She made a quick , controlledgesture towards the desk in the corner . " 1 ' 11 sit down now and write the cheque . " Willy shook her head . " I 'm not going to sell him , " she repeated . " It 's no use asking any more , " Mrs. Manigault said . " I wo n't give it . " Her voice rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price for any two-year-old . But I want to see what we can do with him . It worries me . I 'm afraid that Shannon will ruin him . After all , he was our colt first . . . " Willy sat up in bed , her arms clasped about her knees . " I 've had all that out with myself , " she said steadily . " You could have kept him . But you did n't . You gave him to me . " Their eyes met and held each other for a moment . Mrs. Manigault looked away . She laughed nervously . " Oh , of course ! I was n't disputing your ownership . I just wanted you to know how I felt . Joe and I both want to do everythingwe can to help . " She picked her glove up from where it had fallen on the floor , straightened it out with a little flip and drew it on . She opened the door and stepped out into the hall . " Good night , Willy , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door had closed behind Mrs. Manigault she turned over on her side again , pillowing her cheek on her hand . While she was talking with Mrs. Manigault she had been assailed by a deathlyP270weariness . At that moment she wanted nothing but sleep . But now that her visitor had gone she could not sleep but lay staring with bright eyes at the lighted transom . Elsie Manigault had been trembling too , so much that she could hardly control her voice when she said good night . It was not disappointment at not being able to buy the stallion that put that look of unutterable fatigue in her eyes . It was some other disappointment , some other **25;9107;TOOLONG , something she had always wanted and never got and now feared that she never would get . Nobody gets what they want , Willy thought , and lay watching the events of the day recede , losing little by little their fiery brightness until they seemed like something that had happened a long time ago , to be remembered , but only at intervals and that more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper which , when it has lain long enough , turns brittle , so that , finding when we open the casket only the brown , dry fragments , we forget what was written on the fair page and do not visit the room that harbored it any more . P271WHEN CHAPMAN BOARDED his train at midnight his berthwas made up and he went at once to bed . But he lay sleepless , thinking of the abrupt leave he had taken of his duties at the university and of the trip abroad he would shortly make . Two weeks ago he had written to a friend in the State Department , telling him that he was going to Italy , that while he was there he intended to talk with a certain nobleman , still in office , though known to be inimical to Fascism . If the State Department were agreeable he would place what information he was able to get at its service when he returned . Hampton Means had telephoned him that night : " When can you leave ? " " The Savoia sails on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make that . " He had gone down to Washington and had talked with Means and with the under-secretary and was about to return to New York when he realized that his boat would not sail for ten days . There are occasions when we seem to have outrun time , to be standing , waiting for an intolerably slow companion to catch up with us . The night that holds back a lovers ' meeting will , in memory , cover a span of years ; we can face a lifetime with more equanimity than the half hour that intervenes before a fateful encounter . It seemed impossible to Chapman that he should return to New York . He called the Union station , found that a reservation had just been cancelled , and boarded a south-bound train that   night . He had had an hour free before his train came in but some instinct kept him from communicating with Catherine . But he would have to let her know he was coming if he was to be met at the train . He decided that he would telegraph her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woke at eight o'clock . The train was passing , at full speed , through a country town . On a bench before a whitecolumnedporch loafers were already sunning themselves . From the square a red-clay road spun out , parallel with the railroad tracks . Two boys were driving a herd of cows along it . He went into the washroom , dressed and entered the diner . It was crowded but he found a table that had only one occupant , a black-haired young man about thirty years of age . A waiter brought a platter of ham and eggs and a pot of coffee . The young man lifted the newspaper he had had spread out before him , folded it and handed it to Chapman . " I 'm through with it , " he said . " Thanks , " Chapman said and , holding the folded paper in his hand , studied the menu . " I 'll have ham and eggs , too , " he told the waiter . " No orange juice . " He looked at the newspaper : Flying low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thirteenth successive night , after a day of comparative quiet . . . But the RAF Bombers have set Havre afire , he thought . . . U S May Use British World Bases . . . He raised his eyes from the newspaper . The red road had slipped from the right to the left side of the tracks . The cows , changed miraculously from Holsteins to Jerseys , P271were being turned through down bars into a pasture . One of the boys had suffered no metamorphosis . The other had become a young man , hatless , his blue jeans girded low on his lean hips . He felt himself observed and turned and meeting the fleeting gaze , winked and raised his thumb to his nose . The waiter brought Chapman 's order . Chapman wrote his telegram and handed it to him . His companion was rising . " Do n't you want your paper ? " Chapman asked . The young man smiled , evidently disposed to be friendly . " Help yourself . By Jove ! " he added , looking down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ham than I did . " " Naw suh , naw suh ! " the hovering waiter said quickly . Chapman laughed , lifting a forkful of eggs to his mouth . " I always eat ham and eggs on the train , " he said . " Ca n't stand ' em any other time . " The other laughed too . " You may talk of gin and beer ! " he said . He lingered a second , seemed on the verge of saying something else , then abruptly laid a quarter beside his plate and departed . Chapman , taking his first draught of hot coffee , looked after him . An odd remark , that , about the gin and beer , to come from a fellow with a jib cut in that fashion . The young man , tall , well set up , with unusually broad shoulders , looked as if he had been on Wall Street but still kept up the athletic sport in which he had distinguished himself in college . But the glance of the dark blue eyes was at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , and the cheeks , freshly shaved but still faintly stubbled ,   showed the network of fine wrinkles that tell of long hours spent at a desk . An editor , Chapman thought , Life or Fortune . He ate his ham and eggs , drank a second cup of coffee and went into the club car to smoke . It was crowded . There was only one vacant seat . As he sat down he saw that the occupant of the next seat was the young man to whom he had talked in the dining car . He exchanged greetings with him , lent him a match and turning his chair slightly away , gazed out of the window . He had had a letter from Edith just before he left : her second letter since he had last seen her . She wanted , she said , at least to have a talk with him . But if he could help it he would not see her again . There was nothing he could say to her . He had behaved badly , going to her apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of explanation or apology , and now he was on his way to see another woman , to whom he had behaved even worse . If he went back to Edith she would weep a little and finally tell him that nothing he had done made any difference . But Catherine , even if she loved him  --  he did not know whether she ever had loved him  --  might stand up as straight as that poplar outside the window and tell him to go to hell . He had always known that she was capable of hate . If she had come to hate him she would say things that he would remember as long as he lived . He thought as hegazed out of the window that he was a fool to go down - .1 I there . It was a late September landscape . A meadow , cleft by a brook , ran in yellow and russet waves of sedge grass up toP275a wood . There was a drift of fallen maple leaves on the wood 's fringe but the tall , straight trees , the hickories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the sky and few of the leaves had turned , except where a poplar showed amid its dark green a sudden flare of pure yellow . He watched the sunlight creep out of the woods and run , glistening , on freshly turned red earth . In the north , this time of year , the leaves have all turned , he thought , and the colors are sharper . . . This is a softer landscape . Not wild , like Maine ; neither park nor cemetery , like Connecticut , but a landscape dominated by man , tutored to his needs . And it seemed to him that the landscape was alive , a great beast , with flowing , sinuous limbs that disposed themselves in various attitudes , a gentle beast that stood or gazed or marched docilely , drawing behind it the great wain loaded with harvest fruits . He told himself that it is not from Theocritus , from Bion , from Bacchylides that you get the feeling of the Greek landscape , but from Hesiod . And the picture comes to you , not from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains , meets with a god or goddess , but from the glimpses of homely country living that Hesiod affords . The gray-eyed Athena , visiting Ulysses ' palace , wraps herself in a cloak of rough , home-spun weave . Ulysses ploughs his own fields . The dark young man had turned so that he now faced Chapman . He spoke , smiling . " Pretty nice out there . " He pronounced the word " out " like a Virginian . Chapmaneyed him curiously . " This your country ? " he asked . The young man shook his head . " My people came
