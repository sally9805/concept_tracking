For France it was the biggest week since liberation . Abroad , General Charles de Gaulle 's Government prepared to assume a full role in world affairs ( see above ) . At home , it took its first firm step toward parliamentary administration . <P> In the Third Republic 's Senate Chamber ( a gilded , rococo wing of the Luxembourg Palace ) the new Consultative Assembly held its first session . Created in Algiers more than a year ago , the Assembly had been reorganized , its membership upped from 102 to 248 . Resistance groups held 148 seats . Third Republic parliamentarians untainted by collaboration 60 , overseas delegates 40 . <P> The briefcases on the desks of the Resistance members were new and shiny . The old parliamentarians ' briefcases were battered with use . A white-robed monk , a grey-haired Negro , a red-fezzed Arab and half a dozen women ( where women never had a place before ) were sprinkled through the Assembly . In the gallery sat U.S. Ambassador Jefferson Caffery , British Ambassador Alfred Duff Cooper , Russian Ambassador Alexander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Venerable , rotund Senator Paul Cuttoli , 80-year-old Algeria-born Radical Socialist , delivered the opening address . When he denounced the cartels , there was loud applause . ' General de Gaulle spoke briefly . When he said : " We must . . . undertake great reforms , " there was loud applause . Then the Assembly chose homely , rhetorical-Flix Gouin , 56 , veteran Socialist deputy and head of the Assembly in Algiers , as its president , buckled down to work . <P> Sounding Board . The Consultative Assembly has no real legislative power . It functions as advisor and consultant of the Provisional Government . But it will be the sounding board of French political opinion until parliamentary elections can be held . <P> Two pressing political issues before the Assembly : <P> The status of the National Council of Resistance . Now that the underground fight is over , the C.N.R. is struggling to assume a new function . Its Communist steering group wants it to become a kind of council of state , a watchdog to keep France on the path of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed by the Assembly . The tension between the Provisional Government and the Communists . By disbanding the leftist Patriotic Militia , Charles de Gaulle had openly clashed with them ( TIME , Nov. 13 ) . Now he offered them a sizable sop . By special decree his Government pardoned Maurice Thorez , Secretary of the French Communist Party , father of the 1936 Popular Front . Shortly after war was declared , Thorez left France , was convicted of desertion from the French Army in 1939 . Now his return was expected soon . In Paris , Thorez will sit as one of the 14 Communist delegates* in the Assembly , give the powerful French Left shrewd leadership . <P> <P> *Seven belong to the parliamentary group and seven to the Resistance .
