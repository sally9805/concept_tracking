Soprano Kirsten Flagstad and Tenor Lauritz Melchior , who are none too fond of each other professionally , sang Tristan und Isolde one night last week at Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera . This popular team had impersonated Wagner 's potion-bibbing lovers many a time before . But this time Tristan was an event . In the pit was the Met 's first U. S.-born , U. S.-trained conductor , sandy-haired , bespectacled Edwin McArthur . <P> To get into that pit , McArthur had come a long way . As a piano prodigy in Denver , he made money for music lessons by selling magazines on street corners , picking berries at 2 a quart . In high school , young McArthur played the typewriter ; his virtuoso prestissimo won him the Colorado championship . Then he turned accompanist and vocal coach , for Ginger Rogers and Ethel Merman as well as for concert artists like John Charles Thomas , Gladys Swarthout and , finally , Soprano Flagstad . <P> All the time , cigar-smoking ( box-a-day ) McArthur studied orchestra scores , practiced waving a stick before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , his onetime singing pupil Blanche Victoria Pope , his stand-in vocalist in his studies . Flagstad plugged him as a conductor ( TIME , Feb. 5 , 1940 ) . The San Francisco and Chicago operas hired Conductor McArthur ; last year the Met unbent and let him do a Tristan in a post-season visiting performance in Boston . But not until last week did the Met let him play in its own back yard . Critics gave Edwin McArthur top marks . And this week 's McArthur Tristan sold out .
