Nothing in 1943 's news more clearly illustrated the vast change in the U.S. climate than the report made by the five globe-circling Senators in last week 's secret session of the Senate . Their main point was that the British were outsmarting Americans all over the world . <P> But they were not bitter , angry or even notably anti-British . They seemed more to envy the smooth , experienced job the British are doing for Britain , and wondered why Americans , once famed as Yankee traders , could not do as well . They complained of American " stupidity " in dealings abroad . <P> Months and months ago observers had noted that American isolationism was dead as an important force ; but still many intellectuals and interventionist worrywarts had gone on whacking away at the dead dog . For the five Senators were not complaining against U.S. participation abroad-they were complaining that such participation was not shrewd enough , or wise enough , or big enough . <P> Thus the glee with which the furious little fringe of isolationists seized on the Senatorial remarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeble efforts to keep the lid on their criticisms , or as beside the point as the shock felt in London . <P> For what had long been inevitable , what had long been clear to some , was now clear to all : the question about U.S. participation , in the world is not if , but how ? <P> In To Stay . The Senators ' other points , as gathered secondhand by the probing press : <P> &gt;The U.S. must keep its foreign air bases after the war . <P> &gt; The U.S. is putting up more than its share of oil to fight World War &gt; The U.S. should have Siberian air bases to attack Japan . <P> Each member of the Senatorial junket seemed to have one major concern . Massachusetts ' Henry Cabot Lodge was most insistent on the subject of Siberian air bases , was acridly criticized by his fellow travelers . Said they : Lodge 's statement that possession of Siberian air bases would save a million American lives was both inaccurate and unfortunate ; Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Ralph Owen Brewster was most concerned about Lend-Lease , charged that it was being mismanaged , cited as an example of mismanagement the fact that Australia got 30,000 new trucks for civilian use as compared to 15,000 for the U.S. , said he would ask the Truman Committee to investigate . <P> Kentucky 's Albert Benjamin ( " Happy " ) Chandler reiterated his contention that the Jap was U.S. enemy No. 1 . that a major offensive should be launched in the Pacific , that the Administration should give General Douglas MacArthur more support " or get rid of him . " <P> Georgia 's Richard Brevard Russell was most worried about the extensive promises being made by the U.S. <P> When the little group of professional isolationists tried to capitalize on the ammunition passed them by the Senators , Maine 's Brewster stepped in to do some scotching . Said he : " I can serve as Exhibit A for isolationists on our difficulties around the world . Yet I am convinced that we are in the game to stay , and rather than pull out our marbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight . "
