On a cold rainy day last week , curious Parisians packed a dingy courtroom in the Palais de Justice to hear a red-robed judge pronounce sentence on Mathilde Carre . She was a pert , petite woman with bangs - the very picture of a Parisian gamine . The French thought they understood Mathilde , though they could not forgive her . <P> Daughter of a substantial family of professional soldiers , Mathilde Carre was on the loose in Paris just after the German conquest . She was young , attractive , divorced , and she found it all too easy to have a good time . An ex-captain of the Polish army got her into the Rseau Interalli , an important network of the Franco-British underground . This Pole , a handsome man named Roman Czerniawsky , had been an intelligence officer . With Mathilde 's brilliant help , he was soon feeding the British war office valuable information on the German order of battle . Mathilde was the network 's cryptographer . Her fervently admiring comrades called her La Chatte ( The Cat ) , because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark-haired mistress named Renee Borni . Perhaps Mathilde was jealous . In any case , when the Gestapo pounced on the three of them in a frowsy little Montmartre hotel , Mathilde was more like a purring cat than a fighting tigress . Soon she was having an affair with a Gestapo corporal named Hugo Bleicher . <P> In a little notebook , Mathilde had the names and addresses of 35 comrades in the underground . Solicitously , she accompanied her new German lover on his rounds as he picked up the 35 . Most were sent to Buchenwald ; only 14 ever got back to France . <P> After a while , Mathilde met a gaunt Frenchman named Pierre de Vomecourt , who also worked for the underground . He asked her to work with him . When he found out that she was playing a double game , she persuaded De Vomecourt that she had important information which the British should have . She wanted to get to England , she said , out of the Boche 's reach . With some difficulty the British intelligence spirited Mathilde and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the rest of the war in a British jail . One British operative said of her : " For Mathilde , resistance and espionage work , which we found to be difficult and hazardous business , were like children 's games . " <P> Last week , in the dingy Palais de Justice courtroom , Mathilde sat with a wry twist on her feline mouth . She was sentenced to die before a firing squad . <P> What had Mathilde Carr wanted from life ? During the trial , the prosecution had read this , from her diary : " What I wanted most was a good meal , a man , and , once more , Mozart 's Requiem . "
