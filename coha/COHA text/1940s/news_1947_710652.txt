He mentioned , incidentally , that he had received an anonymous letter that asked , " What are you looking for  --  a wooden kimono ? " but assured reporters he would not ask for police protection because of this threat . " If anybody is looking for me , " he added , " they 'll be able to find me in Saratoga .
