txt When the Security Council takes up the question ? of Spain again it will apparently decide upon a thorough investigation of the charges against the Franco regime and the question whether it is an active threat to world peace . All eleven nations represented on the Council are reported to favor this course in principle , and need only agree upon the type and scope of the inquiry . This is a welcome development . The more thorough the investigation is , the better . The power of investigation , together with the submission of findings to world opinion , constitutes one of the Council 's strongest weapons . In a world of wrought-up emotions , contradictory ideologies and relentless propoganda usually coupled with severe censorship and a black-out of the news , it represents the best available means for ascertaining impartial truth . For that reason the United Nations Charter wisely devoted a special paragraph ( Chapter VI , Article 34 ) to that weapon : The Security Council may investigate any dispute , or any situation , which might lead to international friction or give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuance is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security . This right of inquiry was also one of the primary functions of the League of Nations and helped it settle many a dispute . Though the League 's findings were not always honored , as in the case of Japan and Manchuria , its official inquiries clarified the issues and thus facilitated the line-up of the nations in the final reckoning . But because this weapon is so powerful , it should never be blunted either by frivolous use for propaganda or retaliatory purposes , or by an equally frivolous employment of the veto on the part of the Big Powers in order to escape scrutiny of their actions . Of these two possible abuses , the latter is likely to prove the more troublesome . Since seven out of the eleven members of the Council must approve an investigation , it is always in their power to vote down an inquiry which on the face of it is unjustified , but only a sense of fairness and responsibility can keep the veto power of the big nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second proposal of the kind to be put before the Security Council , the first being the Ukrainian request for an investigation of the situation in Indonesia , which the Council turned down as serving no constructive purpose . Events have justified that verdict . But one can only regret that no such proposal was advanced in the troublesome cases of Iran and Greece . Both Russia and Great Britain appeared to oppose any action , the first on the ground that the Counc has no right to scrutinize her action the latter on a point of honor . Yet a investigation on the spot would hav absolved Great Britain as clearly a did the neutral observers of the Gree election . And the case of Iran is nol in more urgent need of investigatio than ever , as attested anew by th British Parliamentary delegation re turned from Iran . We trust that if the United State is ever involved in a controversy c that kind , and if the Council votes a inquiry , the American Government wi welcome an investigation of its action ; The light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abuse of power .
