The future never looked darker for the business of U.S. higher education ( see col. 1 ) . So the obstinately optimistic citizens of Portland , Ore . ( home of one of Henry J. Kaiser 's miraculous shipyards ) thought it was just the time to launch moribund little Albany College on a bigger career with a new name , new president and fantastically lush new campus . <P> The new college owed its life to a real-estate bargain . Last spring 75-year-old , coed Presbyterian Albany College seemed to be on its last legs . It had lost its accredited standing , was rapidly withering away in two downtown Portland buildings . Then trustees heard that the fabulous , $1,300,000 M. Lloyd Frank estate could be bought for $50,000. * <P> The college raised the money overnight . Promptly the trustees gave their " dream college " a handsome new president , firm-chinned Dr. Morgan Samuel Odell of Los Angeles ' Occidental College . A brave new name topped the transformation-Lewis &; Clark , for the Northwest explorers . <P> Last week Lewis &; Clark 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrubbing &; polishing their dream campus . The 35-room mansion , a wonderland of curving staircases , imported glass and secret panels , became administration offices and a women 's dormitory . The 20-car garage , complete with carillon , was converted to laboratories and sun rooms . Students disported themselves in a swimming pool with underwater lights , a beach of Belgian sand , two athletic fields , 60 acres of gardens . <P> Trustees noted with satisfaction that Lewis &; Clark 's freshman class ( 100 ) was twice as big as last year 's . <P> <P> * The estate had been closed ever since its owner , onetime treasurer of Portland 's famed Meier &; Frank department store , was divorced by his wife in a 1932 scandal .
