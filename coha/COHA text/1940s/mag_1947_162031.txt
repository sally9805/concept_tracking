The knock at the door of the Interstate Commerce Commission sounded familiar . It sounded like the urgent rap of a man who knew his rights and wanted them fulfilled . It was the railroads again . Last year they had come seeking a 20% rate increase . They got 17.6%-a $1 billion boost in their annual revenues . <P> Last week , the railroads said they needed another billion in the form of an additional 16% average increase ( 25% for the eastern railroads , 15% for the southern and western territories ) ; the first billion was all spent on higher wage and material costs . As an example of their need , the Pennsylvania Railroad turned out its pockets . It had lost $10,438,824 in the first five months of 1947 . <P> The railroads had some cogent arguments : since 1939 , rates had risen only 17.6% , but wages had risen 53% , materials 60% . The war-boom increase in traffic was no longer enough to make up the difference . Furthermore , 1,000,000 non-operating railroad workers are demanding a 20-an-hour pay boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs ; the railroad brotherhoods are demanding 44 changes in operating rules , which the railroads claim would cost another billion . If these increases are granted , said the railroads , even a 16% rate increase will not be enough .
