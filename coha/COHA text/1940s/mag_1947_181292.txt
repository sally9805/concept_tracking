She was just a Formosan peasant 's daughter , but she had been beautiful in her youth , when she went to Shanghai in the ' 20s and studied Communism . Now , at 46 , after some advanced studies in Moscow and nine years in Jap prisons , she was tuberculous and no longer beautiful . But baggy-eyed , jug-eared Chinese General Chen Yi , looking back on the worst month of his Formosa governorship , would never forget the woman known as Hsieh Hseh-hung-Thanks Snow Red . <P> Chen blamed last month 's Formosa rebellion on Snow Red . This was unduly modest of him ; most of the trouble had been made by Chen and his postliberation carpetbaggers from the mainland . <P> Snow Red , as president of her local Women 's Association , had made anti-Chen speeches but-said those who knew her- " she did n't sound like a Communist . " Chen admitted last week : " Before the trouble started , the Communists were not well organized , but after it started they seized their opportunities . " <P> How to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending Japanese possession since 1895 ) , 64-year-old Chen had seized an opportunity himself . With his Chinese aides and " monopoly police " he took over and expanded the Japanese system of government industrial and trade monopoly ( sugar , camphor , tea , paper , chemicals , oil refining , cement ) . He confiscated some 500 Jap-owned factories and mines , tens of thousands of houses . As the Shanghai newspaper Wen Hui Pao remarked , he ran everything " from the hotel to the night-soil business . " The Formosans felt like colonial stepchildren rather than long-lost sons of Han . <P> One pleasant evening a truckload of monopoly police cruised down the main streets of Formosa 's capital , Taipeh , hunting monopoly violators . They piled out , clubbed a woman who had been hawking cigarets . ( This was against Chen 's law , which said that Formosans could smoke only Formosa-made cigarets-from his gang 's factory . ) A crowd gathered . A policeman fired . The crowd chased off the police , burned their truck . <P> Next day Chen 's gendarmes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four , wounded eleven . The rebellion was on . Crowds seized mainlanders , beat some to death with two-by-fours . They set up a People 's Purge Committee . Moderates in the Committee-like the tea merchant Wang Tien-teng-broadcast middle-of-the-road demands : election of mayors ; public enterprises to be run by Formosans ; abolition of monopolies . Said Wang : " We do not request independence . We support the Central Government and we love our motherland . " <P> But Snow Red and plenty of other Formosans at Taichu ( five hours south of the capital ) wanted more than that . She took over as chairman of the Taichu branch of the rebellion ; her followers disarmed the local police , held the town for ten days . The People 's Purge Committee added 32 new demands . Samples : an autonomous constitution , the surrender of monopoly controls to islanders . Some rebels even talked of a U.S. protectorate . In Pingtung , a band of them sang The Star-Spangled Banner as they took over the town .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
