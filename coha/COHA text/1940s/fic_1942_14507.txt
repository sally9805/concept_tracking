Scene:A small village in Santo Domingo ; early in the nineteenth century . It is the middle of a very hot afternoon in midsummer . At Rise : PEDRO 'S petio . PEDRO garrulously asleep in the hammock . A rabbit 's foot is tied around his neck and on the pillow beside him are a four-leaf clover and a good-luck penny , both of which PEDRO has picked up . MANUELA , her back to the audience , sits beside him , fanning him with a large palmetto fan . She is deeply absorbed in a black-covered book which she holds in her other hand . It appears to be a Bible . Three or four colored girls , close together , looking in their bright dresses like a display of rare tropical fruits in an open-air market , crouch at the edge of the patio , singing softly , a composition sounding if possible sensuously liturgical . To the rhythm of this singing , MANUELA fans , and to the rhythm of the singing also , though he is probably not aware of it , PEDRO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in his sleep ) Sixty ! I wo n't pay a peso over sixty ! ( MENUELA rises , crosses to the girls , raising her fan to stop their singing for a moment . Out of his haggling sleep ) Not sixty-two  --  not sixty-one  --  sixty p. 3 MANUELA VARGAS Please pay it , dear ! Sleep , beloved ! Sleep ! ( Waves girls off with fan . They exit , singing softly . ) PEDRO VARGAS ( Like a catapult ) Sixty ! MANUELA VARGAS ( To reassure him ) He 'll sell , husband . They always do . PEDRO VARGAS Not a farthing over  --  sixty . MANUELA VARGAS ( Comes back to her chair and starts to read again , fanning PEDRO meanwhile ) My parents did . And at your figure . And what a figure ! PEDRO VARGAS Robber ! Cheat ! ( He turns over on his side , the veiling over his face that protects him from the flies falls to the ground . She picks it up , covers his face with it  --  shoos away a humming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MANUELA VARGAS Sleep , my darling . Sleep , beloved . Sleep , my gallant trader ! ( Her voice tinkles with friendly irony . ) PEDRO VARGAS ( In triumph ) Sold ! MANUELA VARGAS There , now , you may rest easy . ( PEDRO snores orchestrally  --  MANUELA pensively ) Sleep , beloved , sleep . ( The snore subsides , MANUELA reads her Bible . She becomes so caught that she forgets to fan . ISABELLA GALVEZ , the Widow Galvez , enters the patio . She is plump and amiable. ) p. 4 ISABELLA GALVEZ What a touching domestic scene ! MANUELA VARGAS Isabella  --  shh ISABELLA GALVEZ The devoted wife  --  reads her camouflaged Bible  --  fans her sleeping spouse ! MANUELA VARGAS Isabella , do n't wake him . ISABELLA GALVEZ What 's he got there  --  around his neck ? MANUELA VARGAS It 's his rabbit 's foot , and a four-leaf clover , and a lucky penny . He 's very superstitious . Did n't you know that ? He always sleeps that way  --  festooned with amulets . PEDRO VARGAS ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MANUELA VARGAS That 's right , darling , do n't pay it ! ( To ISABELLA ) He feels better when he does n't pay it . Even in his sleep he barters . He keeps adding and subtracting . ISABELLA GALVEZ Adding , mostly . No wonder he 's the richest man in town . MANGO SELLER ( Her head pops in suddenly at the window over PEDRO 'S head . ) Mangoes ! MANUELA VARGAS Shh  --  no  --  no  --  go away . ( As MANGO WOMAN disappears , PEDRO rolls over , noisily sterterous . MANUELA crosses to hammaock and covers PEDRO with netting. ) p. 5 ISABELLA GALVEZ But , Manuela , tell me  --  where is he ? MANUELA VARGAS ( Pretends not to know ) who ? ISABELLA GALVEZ Estramudo , of course . MANUELA VARGAS Oh , the book ISABELLA GALVEZ Certainly . How sly you are  --  covering it up like a Bible ! MANUELA VARGAS Well , you know how strict Pedro is . But , oh , Isabella , I ca n't thank you enough for giving me this novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He 's just escaped ! ISABELLA GALVEZ From the harem ? MANUELA VARGAS No , no  --  from the French privateers . ISABELLA GALVEZ ( Takes book from MANUELA ) Oh , wait ! Wait till he gets to the harem ! ( She giggles lasciviously . ) MANUELA VARGAS ( Sits ) Do such men live ? Do they breathe the air ? Do they ride the waves ? ISABELLA GALVEZ Estramudo does . He 's been captured and killed and drowned . He 's suffered every variety of death . But he always pops , up . He 's escaped in a thousand disguises . But they 'll never get him . p. 6 MANUELA VARGAS Oh , no . ISABELLA GALVEZ ( With naive boastfulness ) I know just what he looks like . I have a cousin who saw him in a theatre in Seville . MANUELA VARGAS ( Incredulously ) She saw him ! ISABELLA GALVEZ She saw him . ( PEDRO snores . MANUELA fans him . ) MANUELA VARGAS Sleep , baby , sleep . ISABELLA GALVEZ He 's in good voice today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ISABELLA GALVEZ You are too lenient with him . Why do n't you rebel ? MANUELA VARGAS A bargain is a bargain ISABELLA GALVEZ It was n't your bargain . It was your mother 's . MANUELA VARGAS Nevertheless it was made . ISABELLA GALVEZ He cheats in all his bargains . Cheat in yours . MANUELA VARGAS Isabella ! He supports my father and mother . ISABELLA GALVEZ He 's supposed to . MANUELA VARGAS He does what he 's supposed to , so must I. p. 7 ISABELLA GALVEZ I ca n't understand it . I 'll never understand  --  that you , the most sensitive of all us girls in the convent  --  the bookworm , the class poet , in fact , should be married to that pumpkin . MANUELA VARGAS Pumpkin ! Why , Isabella ! He 's traveled all over the world . He sold cannonballs , you know , to all the governments . Now really , Isabella , you can not call a man like Pedro a pumpkin . ISABELLA GALVEZ Well , he 's got a frightful temper . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that does n't mean anything . Actually he 's very sweet to me  --  very generous . He loves good food . ISABELLA GALVEZ Obviously . MANUELA VARGAS And when I plan an especially good meal , he praises me . ISABELLA GALVEZ Well , you put a good face on it , Manuela , and that 's gallant of you . But  --  do you remember how we used to plan whom we 'd marry  --  the wonderful romances we used to spin  --  you , Manuela , you especially . MANUELA VARGAS That was adolescence . You know , Isabella , I think the Gulf Stream did us in ! ISABELLA GALVEZ Everything around here is blamed on the Gulf Stream . p. 8 MANUELA VARGAS But it 's so . A caprice of the Gulf Stream ruined father 's fisheries . Of course he always gambled away half his income , but when his income ceased altogether he went right on gambling . He told me  --  just when I was considering Pedro  --  he told me , father did , that if he had to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was a case of life and death . ( PEDROshifts noisily . ) PEDRO VARGAS Sold ! MANUELA VARGAS ( Relieved ) Oh , I 'm so glad , dear . ( To ISABELLA as PEDRO snores in triumph ) He 's concluded the deal . Listen . Victory march . ISABELLA GALVEZ I bet it was a bankruptcy sale . MANUELA VARGAS ( As the hammock creaks with PEDRO 'S weight ) Oh , dear , I must reinforce the hammock . You know he never sleeps in a bed  --  always in a hammock . Is n't that curious  --  always in a hammock ? ISABELLA GALVEZ That must add to your sense of insecurity . MANUELA VARGAS You would n't think a prosaic business man would have so many odd habits . ISABELLA GALVEZ You 're a martyr . p. 9 MANUELA VARGAS ( Rising ) A martyr . ISABELLA GALVEZ I do n't believe in it . MANUELA VARGAS ( Crossing to hammock to cover PEDRO with netting ) I have luxury  --  my parents are provided for  --  and I have my dreams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know he disapproves of you . ISABELLA GALVEZ Two officers from the Capitol are here tonight . They belong to the viceroy 's private guard . They 're on leave . MANUELA VARGAS How nice for them ! ISABELLA GALVEZ First lieutenants . Stunning in their uniforms . MANUELA VARGAS I 'm sure they are . ISABELLA GALVEZ Join us . Join us tonight . A foursome . PEDRO VARGAS Forty ! Ridiculous ! ISABELLA GALVEZ What do you say , Manuela ? MANUELA VARGAS No . ISABELLA GALVEZ Why not ? MANUELA VARGAS A bargain is a bargain . My real life I prefer to keep scrupulous and tidy . My dream life  --  impossibly romantic . p. 10 ISABELLA GALVEZ Mix ' em . Mix ' em . MANUELA VARGAS No , Isabella , not for me , but thank you very much . Please , go away before he wakes up . ( It is too late , PEDRO sits bolt upright , wide awake . ) PEDRO VARGAS ( As he emerges from his dream ) Cheaters ! Robbers ! Where 's my rabbit 's foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PEDRO clutches at it , reassured . ) PEDRO VARGAS ( Suddenly seeing ISABELLA ) What are you doing on my property ? I thought I 'd forbidden you to talk to her ? ISABELLA GALVEZ So broad-beamed  --  so narrow-minded . PEDRO VARGAS She 's a loose widow . MANUELA VARGAS ( Pleading for tolerance ) If she is a widow , is it not God 's will ? Is survival in itself an act of infidelity ? ISABELLA GALVEZ My husband , I 'll have you know , died happy . PEDRO VARGAS He died ignorant ! MANUELA VARGAS I 'll do my best not to survive you , Pedro . I 'll try ! p. 11 PEDRO VARGAS I wo n't have this baggage on my premises . MANUELA VARGAS Go away , Isabella . ISABELLA GALVEZ And I wo n't have your insults . PEDRO VARGAS Strumpet ! MANUELA VARGAS ( Pleading ) Isabella ! ISABELLA GALVEZ Look at the beam in your own eye . Your wife may be technically faithful , but mentally , you might as well know it , she takes excursions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GALVEZ Always at her prayers , eh ? Well , look ! PEDRO VARGAS ( Reaching for the book ) Put down the good book . You defile it . ISABELLA GALVEZ I defile it , do I ? Well , look ! ( PEDRO takes book from ISABELLA , goes back to hammock and sits reading book . ) MANUELA VARGAS ( Terrified ) Isabella ! ISABELLA GALVEZ I 'm sorry , my dear , I could n't take any more from that old skinflint . Good job for you , too . Clear the air . You have n't the courage to rebel by yourself . I 'll make you . Maybe after you 've had it out you 'll join me tonight after all . You can have the tall one . p. 12 PEDRO VARGAS ( Looking up ) The tall one ! ISABELLA GALVEZ Six foot one . He 's as tall this way ( She makes a gesture reaching up ) as you are that way . ( Makes a gesture reaching out . She flounces out . ) PEDRO VARGAS ( Staring at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Where did you get this ? Where did this come from ? MANUELA VARGAS ( Weakly ) Pedro , please ( He stares at the page before him . ) PEDRO VARGAS ( Reading from the title page ) " The Glorious Adventures of Estramudo the Pirate . " MANUELA VARGAS Just a silly little novel . PEDRO VARGAS " Together with a full and uncensored account of his travels far and wide . " MANUELA VARGAS Just meant to pass the time . PEDRO VARGAS " His intrigues at the courts of Europe " MANUELA VARGAS Of no importance whatever PEDRO VARGAS " and among the potentates of Asia , together with " ( He stops for breath. ) p. 13 MANUELA VARGAS ( Picks it up from memory ) " Together with a brave account of his adventures with the caliphates of the Turks , including his sensational escape , together with nine of the wives , from the Palace of the Grand Vizier himself ! Together with " PEDRO VARGAS Stop it ! Stop it ! You know it by heart ! MANUELA VARGAS Only the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VARGAS He 's not a criminal ! He only attacks other pirates . And , Pedro , whenever he lands , he distributes alms . He 's the Robin Hood of the seas ! PEDRO VARGAS Romanticizing a criminal  --  this robber  --  this murderer  --  this  --  this MANUELA VARGAS This Estramudo  --  this improbable man  --  Estramudo . PEDRO VARGAS You linger over his name . MANUELA VARGAS It has a cadence . Of all my heroes  --  Napoleon PEDRO VARGAS He 's rotting in St. Helena where this fellow should be . MANUELA VARGAS Lord Byron p. 14 PEDRO VARGAS ( Contemptuously ) Poet ! MANUELA VARGAS Of all of them Estramudo 's name is the loveliest . Do n't you think so , Pedro  --  just as mere sound ? Or do you prefer Shelley ? No . Too short . Ca n't get into it . Oh , read this , Pedro , it 'll get you out of yourself . PEDRO VARGAS I do n't want to get out of myself ! MANUELA VARGAS I know , but I do wish Oh , Pedro , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do wish you 'd change a little to the spiritual side . PEDRO VARGAS ( Sits bolt upright in hammock ) The spiritual side ! No one is more regular at Mass than I am . Did n't I restore the belfry ? MANUELA VARGAS You restored the belfry . PEDRO VARGAS I distribute prayer books among the poor , do n't I ? MANUELA VARGAS You do , darling , you do . PEDRO VARGAS ( Lies flat on his back , contemplating his benefactions ) Will now , how can I be more spiritual than that ? MANUELA VARGAS Perhaps spiritual is not the word . Perhaps I should have said imaginative . That 's it , I do wish you could be more imaginative . p. 15 PEDRO VARGAS I do n't know what you 're talking about . MANUELA VARGAS ( Wistfully ) For one thing , you 're always sleeping . You 're out all day on your business deals , and the moment you get home you make straight for your hammock . It 's so  --  non-co-operative . PEDRO VARGAS I work hard ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do neglect your personal appearance . PEDRO VARGAS ( Petulant ) I ca n't help that . Everything I eat goes to my stomach . I 'm glandular . MANUELA VARGAS You 're stodgy . PEDRO VARGAS What do you want me to do ? MANUELA VARGAS Ah , Pedro , is life all business , eating and sleeping and philanthropy ? I 've never been outside this village where I was born . Is there no realm beyond  --  no horizon beyond our horizon ? PEDRO VARGAS No . MANUELA VARGAS ( Passionately ) I long for a glimpse of the world beyond this saucer in the hills . I want  --  I want PEDRO VARGAS Well , what do you want ? p. 16 MANUELA VARGAS I want to be able to love you . I want to invest the gross reality of our marriage with some of the quality of my dreams . PEDRO VARGAS No investments . MANUELA VARGAS Except for profit  --  I know . Oh , Pedro , I have infinite love to lavish if only you 'll try . PEDRO VARGAS I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentally ! It 's sinful . MANUELA VARGAS On the contrary , it 's the saving virtue . So far I have not dabbled in reality . I want to center my affections in you  --  but you make it difficult  --  so difficult . PEDRO VARGAS ( Rises , advances on her . MANUELA backs away from him ) How dare you criticize me , sentimental numbskull ! I support your extravagant mother , do n't I ? And your gambling father , do n't I ? While you 're mooning over trash like this ! ( PEDRO snatches book away from her . ) MANUELA VARGAS Please  --  it 's a unique copy . PEDRO VARGAS That 's too many . ( Throws book out of the window ) There  --  it will feed the fishes . It will corrupt even them . I sha n't eat the catch for several Fridays . p. 17 MANUELA VARGAS ( With tragic resignation ) It belonged to Isabella . ( Now MANUELA 'S despair is complete . Somehow the novel has become a symbol to her of an imaginative if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands bereft . CAPUCHO and INKS , her father and mother , come in . INKS , incredibly and flamboyantly dressed , looks like the tails of nine peacocks . CAPUCHO , the gambler , is a little , wizened man who smokes a cheroot and has , since his marriage thirty-five years ago , lost the power of speech . INES has it and exercises it . She is very sycophantic to PEDRO as the source of all the good things of life . CAPUCHO fondles , in the side pocket of his gold-braided trousers , a leather cylinder containing his beloved dice . In his mind , he is constantly rolling dice . ) PEDRO VARGAS ( With heavy sarcasm ) Here are the lady and gentleman now ! Well , peacock ! INES ( With an effulgent smile ) Peacock , he calls me ! How he knows the way to a woman 's heart ! Pedro , my rising sun . Pedro , my evening star . PEDRO VARGAS None of your palaver . It 's no good any more . INES ( Severely  --  to MANUELA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PEDRO VARGAS Ah ! Even she knows ! INES ( Placidly ) I know this . My Pedro , my benefactor , my new-found son PEDRO VARGAS Stop calling me new-found  --  I 've been here for years . INES My life began with the day of your arrival . PEDRO VARGAS On the day of my arrival you had just celebrated your fifty-eighth birthday . ( CAPUCHOrattles his dice ) Stop rattling those infernal dice . INES Stop rattling , Capucho ! He lost today . He lost thirty pesos . He never wins . True , Pedro , my eagle , reckoned by time , you speak truth . But endowed by happiness , gilded by joy , you are new-found  --  and I am reborn . PEDRO VARGAS Shut up ! INES ( To MANUELA ) What have you done , daughter , that your Pedro , whose temper is like drifted butter , whose nature is like the embrace of spring , what have you done that he is curdled ? What have you done ? ( MANUELAcannot speak . She shakes her head , her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her husband , cracks down on him so he jumps ) Capucho ! Your brains , the tidbit you have , are in those dice . ( To PEDRO ) That 's why they never win  --  they 're not weighted . ( She laughs raucously ) Discipline your daughter ! ( CAPUCHO shrugs his shoulders , begins to rattle ) Stop rattling ! p. 19 PEDRO VARGAS He discipline ! Fine disciplinarian ! I 'm sick of it . No more allowance . No more finery . No more gambling . I 'm through . INES He must have been sorely tried  --  sorely tried . That nature as beneficent as April rain ! Manuela , you are selfish , you have always been selfish . You contaminate the source , you curdle the source . Manuela , my girl , you have a God for a husband , and what do you do ? Morning and night you should burn incense , you should offer prayers and thanks . PEDRO VARGAS Enough  --  enough . I 'm sleepy . INES ( Quivering with solicitude ) He 's sleepy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rest . Well , do you hear me ? Pedro , my lamb , Pedro , my exquisite zebra , let your mother make you comfortable . ( She tries to lead him to the hammock . ) PEDRO VARGAS ( Shaking her off , surly ) Let me alone , speckled adder . ( He goes to the hammock by himself and lies down . ) INES ( To MANUELA ) Ah , how sorely you must have tried him ! How sorely ! I will take you in hand , young lady . The birch  --  you are not yet too old for the birch ( At this point , MANUELA , unable to bear more , turns to protest . Her mother gives her an owl-like wink . MANUELA suddenly has to control a laugh ) Lie down , Pedro , my darling . Sleep sweetly , my tired prince . Manuela , fan him . ( She sticks the fan into MANUELA 'S hand and covertly pokes her in the ribs. ) p. 20 PEDRO VARGAS ( Prone on the hammock ) Go inside and shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every word makes me see my daughter 's perfidy . Poison in the sweet water . Seaweed in the scented air . Ah , my daughter  --  my daughter  --  cherish your blessing , lave his feet , worship the ground he treads so lightly . PEDRO VARGAS ( Shouts ) I ca n't stand any more . INES You hear , Capucho , most unworthy of fathers , what your daughter has driven him to . Ah me ! Alas and alack ! ( To PEDRO as he tries vainly to sleep ) Dream of fields of clover , lovely one , and how much you can get for them ! ( Beckons her husband ) Come , withered turnip . ( Very grandly she sweeps inside . CAPUCHO follows . He rattles . ) PEDRO VARGAS ( Shouts ) Do n't rattle ! ( CAPUCHOtakes out cylinder , pours dice into his palm and in dumb-show offers to play . PEDRObecomes apoplectic ) Play you ! ( CAPUCHO nods  --  PEDRO shouts to MANUELA ) He wants to play me ! ( To CAPUCHO ) And if I win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Affably ) You lend . ( He goes inside , PEDRO groans . ) PEDRO VARGAS What a family ! When your mother 's tongue starts clacking , it affects my heart . MANUELA VARGAS ( Sits , hopeless ) Well , rest then . PEDRO VARGAS And no Isabellas when I wake ? MANUELA VARGAS No , husband . PEDRO VARGAS And no tall ones ? MANUELA VARGAS No , and no short ones either ! PEDRO VARGAS Nothing . MANUELA VARGAS Nothing , nothing at all ( Groaning and grunting , PEDRO stretches out on the hammock as we saw him at the opening of the scene . MANUELA sits beside him , fans him slowly . He is soon snoring again . Tears well in MANUELA 'S eves . ) FISHERBOY ( Appears at window over PEDRO 'S hammock ) Donna Vargas ! MANUELA VARGAS Shh ! FISHERBOY ( Holding up book ) Does this belong to you ? ( With a cry of joy MANUELA rises , and her finger goes instinctively to her lips to quiet the boy ) I was on the wharf fishing  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked . p. 22 PEDRO VARGAS ( Stirring ) Robbers ! ( At the sound of PEDRO 'S voice , the FISHERBOY 'S head disappears instantly , but he has thrown the book to MANUELA . She picks it up and hugs it to her ) Robbers ! ( PEDRO turns over ) You 'll hang for this ! You 'll hang ! MANUELA VARGAS He 'll never hang ! PEDRO VARGAS You 'll hang ! ( Having disposed of his imaginary rival , PEDRO turns and sleeps deeply . Hugging the lost treasure to her , MANUELA sits beside her snoring husband . Her spirits are miraculously lifted . The return of the symbol has a seemingly disproportionate effect on her morale . She fans , she opens the book again , happily she settles herself to read , but after a moment she allows the book to fall into her lap . She daydreams aloud . ) MANUELA VARGAS Estramudo , where are you now ? What horizon compasses you ? What glow kindles in what horizon ? Where you are , is it sunset or is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me  --  save Manuela . ( As she contemplates this impossible vision , there begins to throb from on high through the wavering mirage the music made by SERAFIN 'S Troupe as it works its way down the mountainside to the village square . MANUELA looks up , frightened . A mirage of the mind 's eye she is used to , but a mirage of the ear is something new  --  something startling . Surely she must be dreaming this sound , and yet , there it is  --  louder , more insistent . Has she crossed too often the boundary of reality ? Instinctively , in order to combat the sound from outside , she starts reading aloud to create her own reality against what she feels may be imagined ) " Above the flutes and cymbals , Estramudo , seated cross-legged beside his host , became aware of another sound " ( But by this time the actual flutes and cymbals are too insistent to be ignored ; MANUELA questions herself wildly . She looks up . Whence comes the music ? It seems to recede . Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the book , reading louder still ) " a strange sweet singing , mournful-joyous , threaded through with the rhythm of muffled drums . " ( She looks up again . She listens again . Flutes and drums . Surely these are flutes ; these are drums . To make certain of her sanity she rises suddenly and calls for LIZARDA ) Lizarda ! ( LIZARDA , MANUELA 'S maid , a lovely colored girl , comes in ) Lizarda p. 23 LIZARDA Yes , my lady . MANUELA VARGAS ( Her eyes toward the music ) Listen . LIZARDA To what , lady ? MANUELA VARGAS Listen . LIZARDA I 'm listening powerful , my lady . MANUELA VARGAS Do you hear what I hear ? LIZARDA That affects what you hear , my lady . MANUELA VARGAS Strange music  --  from the mountainside . LIZARDA Oh , yes , lady  --  I hear that . MANUELA VARGAS I thought I was going crazy . Is it voodoo ? LIZARDA Oh , no , lady  --  that 's not voodoo  --  that 's foreign . MANUELA VARGAS ( Relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's growing nearer , is n't it , Lizarda ? LIZARDA Yes , it 's sure coming nearer  --  it 's coming down the mountainside as if MANUELA VARGAS Right down into the square LIZARDA Right down into this very house , my lady . ( LAZARDA runs off to investigate . MANUELA , powerfully moved , returns to PEDRO 'S hammock and stands beside it , fanning to the rhythm of the invading sound. ) p. 24 Curtain p. 25 Act 1 , Scene 2 ACT ONESCENE II Scene : A mountain road winding down to the " saucer " in the hills , the village wherein sits the dreaming MANUELA . From this height the fiesta-garlanded village gleams and drowses in the afternoon sun . SERAFIN 'S Troupe , white and colored , incredibly weary and bedraggled but nevertheless making music , winds down the narrow road . The band is playing ; snaredrum and flute , trumpets and guitar , even a hand-organ  --  all blare away for dear life . TRILLO , SERAFIN 'S colored aide-de-camp , enters first and points the way to the others as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , more vociferously ESTABAN , a white member , are in active mutiny .

( He collapses . ) ESTABAN Seems to me the distance from town to town is getting longer and longer and longer . DON BOLO Wish he could book us in the valleys . Seems we 're always climbing mountains . p. 26 ESTABAN The Captain sure finds towns that ai n't even on the map . How does he discover them ? GUMBO There 's nothin ' seems to discourage the boss . He always thinks the next town is good till we hits it . SEMPER ( Wearily ) And there 's always a next stand . GUMBO I wish we could get to a place where there is no next stand .

TRILLO This is where our boss will turn the trick  --  I feel it in my bones . ESTABAN ( Open rebellion ) He turns the trick all right , but what do you get out of it ? TRILLO ( Loyally ) You get what he gets  --  we share and share alike in this troupe . ESTABAN When you 're sharing nothing , what difference does it make who gets the most ? TRILLO Ai n't you got no confidence in the future ? p. 27 ESTABAN That 's the one thing I ai n't got no confidence in . TRILLO Ai n't you got no confidence in the boss ? ESTABAN I 'd have more confidence if he got us a square meal once in a while . I 'm tired of dragging him around . Why do n't he drag us for a change ? TRILLO He 's got to rest for his performance . ESTABAN Why do n't we have to rest for ours ? TRILLO Because he gives more than we do . That 's why . Where 's your courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't eat .

ESTABAN The rabbit he takes out of his kettle every night . p. 28 DON BOLO Yes  --  let 's get that rabbit . TRILLO That rabbit is an optical illusion . You ca n't eat no optical illusion . DON BOLO If it 's an optical illusion , let him pull one out of the kettle right now and we go on . TRILLO That would be prostituting his art . That 's for the public . ESTABAN Well , right now we 're the public and that optical illusion is a live rabbit . DON BOLO Where 's the rabbit ? DON BOLO We eat or we do n't go on . ESTABAN AND DON BOLO Where 's that rabbit ?

DON BOLO He says it before every town . ESTABAN I 'm quitting . TRILLO ( Appealing to his common sense ) On this mountainside ? What 's the sense of that ? Look how yonder village beckons . Give him this one more chance . p. 29 DON BOLO If we do n't eat this time , I go into the militia . ESTABAN That goes for me , Bolo . ( The others echo , " And for me , " " And for me . " ) And I 'll tell him that when he wakes up . TRILLO All right , big mouth , tell him . Meantime we advance to the front . Squads up . ( He marshals them forth . They follow him haltingly ) Forward ! Courage , men . As the poet says , ' " Sic Semper Fidelis . Toujour de audacity .

The donkey cart is propelled onward . ) Curtain p. 30 Act 1 , Scene 3 ACT ONESCENE III Scene : The scene shifts over to the public square of the town . We now see the splendid house of PEDRO VARGAS and the nieghboring house of the WIDOW GALVEZ in perspective . It is the siesta-hour ; the square is droning with somnolence . The fisherboy we saw in Scene I is lying at the foot of the steps leading to PEDROS 'S house , fast asleep . From a circular cavernous cellar-entrance below the bistro on the right comes the intermittent twang of a guitar strumming . The HERMIT is in there , he never comes out . In the far background the spires of the Cathedral shimmer in the heat . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ droop also ; not a breeze stirring down there ; in fact nothing is stirring anywhere . The music of SERAFIN 'S Band begins to fill the square . SERAFIN and his troupe make their entrance . SERAFIN , now sitting up royally in the donkey-cart , is drawn in . TRILLO walks beside the cart . When the troupe reaches the center of the stage , SERAFIN surveys the scene majestically ; he jumps off the cart and dances with the troup  --  a tantalizing sample of their art meant to entice the populace , but nothing happens . No one appears except LIZARDA , who sticks her head out of the door , takes one look and quickly shuts the door . A few windows close . SERAFIN draws from his troupe three great drum rolls ; the last one is quite impreious . Nevertheless absolutely nothing happens  --  not a stir . The troupe gives up in discouragement . They lie down in attitudes of despair , except SERAFIN , who addresses them as if he had just achieved a triumph . SERAFIN ( The Emperor surveying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart of the city ? p. 31 TRILLO The heart 's stopped . SERAFIN ( Majestically , he steps out of the cart ) We shall galvanize it ! ESTABAN What did I tell you ? SERAFIN What are artists for ? TRILLO To go hungry . SERAFIN It is a challenge . Behold this village  --  a catalepsy . The power of art shall transform the paralytic into a dervishdancer . We shall lubricate this community . TRILLO We ca n't lubricate our own stomachs . All these towns seem to shrink up when we hit them . DON BOLO We stimulate the outgoing traffic . TRILLO Oh , what 's the use ? DON BOLO Trillo 's right . What 's the use ? SERAFIN ( Menacing ) What did you say , Don Bolo ? DON BOLO Trillo 's right . What 's the use ? SERAFIN Gentlemen , I must remind you of the dignity of our calling . We are artists . As such it is our duty to be irrepressible . If I , the descendant on one side of the immortal playwright , Lope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who commissioned Columbus to discover new lands  --  if I , in whom flows the blood of the poet and purest Castilian , if I , Serafin , can withstand these slings and arrows , can not you , who are made of baser metal , shuffle them off ? I pause . ( There is a sullen silence. ) p. 32 DON BOLO You 're descended from nothing ! SERAFIN ( Patient , cold ) Do I understand you correctly , Don Bolo ? Do you impugn my veracity ? DON BOLO No , I do n't do that . I jes say you 're a God-awful liar ! ( The others are a bit shocked at this blasphemy though they have for some time privately shared it . A silence . SERAFIN towers above DON BOLO . ) SERAFIN ( Quietly ) Repeat that remark , Don Bolo . DON BOLO I ai n't no Don . You call us all Don . SERAFIN ( Patiently ) As one of royal blood , it is my prerogative to confer titles . DON BOLO But I ai n't no Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity ) I can see that by ennobling you I have ennobled the unworthy . In other circumstances , I should have you quietly garroted . However , in this case  --  noblesse oblig  --  my last cigar . Pass it among the boys . ( BOLO grabs the cigar with avidity . SERAFIN eyes the sleeping FISHERBOY , approaches him , touches him lightly with his foot to wake him. ) p. 33 SERAFIN ( To FISHERBOY ) Forgive me , young man , forgive me . But we are artist . FISHERBOY ( Unmoved ) I ca n't help that ! SERAFIN We wish to give a performance here . Where do we get a license ? FISHERBOY You ca n't get no license . SERAFIN ( Haughty ) And why not , pray ? FISHERBOY Because the Censor wo n't give you one nohow . All acting folk hotfoot it through this town . Don Pedro do n't like ' em . SERAFIN And who is this Don Pedro who deigns to dislike us ? FISHERBOY He 's de riches ' man in town . SERAFIN And where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder ) Right there . SERAFIN Smug residence ! ( The FISHERBOY goes off ) Bundle of nerves , is n't he ? ( To TRILLO ) Trillo TRILLO Yes , Captain . SERAFIN Ring the doorbell of that mansion . Apprise the flunky that Serafin of Madrid presents his compliments and wishes to see the Censor . p. 34 TRILLO To what avail ? SERAFIN What ! TRILLO My behind is dislocated from the last time I presented your compliments . SERAFIN ( Grandly ) The condition of your posterior does not interest me . I order you to ring that doorbell ! ( From the semi-circular opening of the cellar entrance below the bistro the HERMIT starts twanging a melancholy but persuasive tune . SERAFIN is struck by it ) No , wait , Trillo  --  wait . A sign of life already . It 's good ! Something to purloin . Purloin it , boys . ( The boys pick it up on their instruments . SERAFIN darts to the crescent opening . Between cupped hands he calls down to the HERMIT ) Who dwells within ? HERMIT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pesos ? ( TRILLO laughs ironically at this fantastically impossible offer . ) HERMIT No . SERAFIN Why not ? HERMIT Money corrupts . SERAFIN Then I shall give you nothing . But come out . HERMIT Not for anything . p. 35 SERAFIN Why not ? HERMIT Humanity corrupts . SERAFIN A philosopher ! The town has quality ! We should prosper here . TRILLO ( With a glance around , sadly ) I lack your consanguinity . SERAFIN Do n't be defeatist , Trillo . Art is optimism . TRILLO We were so bereft in our last stop we had to dispose . of our donkey . How do you inspire yourself ? SERAFIN Do n't ask me to explain the mystery of genius . ( ISABELLA swings in . She gives SERAFIN the eye . SERAFIN gives her a magnificent bow . To ISABELLA ) Gracious lady . ISABELLA GALVEZ ( Stopping center and turning ) Players ? SERAFIN For your delight , we hope . ISABELLA GALVEZ I 'm sorry for your sake . There 's not much of a public in this village . SERAFIN Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not contain you ? ISABELLA GALVEZ A pretty wit . Where does it come from ? SERAFIN That other universe  --  my spirit . p. 36 ISABELLA GALVEZ What 's your name ? SERAFIN My true name is long and complicated and crusted with tradition . Call me Serafin . And gracious lady  --  yours ? ISABELLA GALVEZ Isabella . SERAFIN An omen ! ISABELLA GALVEZ A good omen , I hope . SERAFIN Another Isabella was an ancestor of mine . ISABELLA GALVEZ ( Sarcastically ) The Queen , I suppose ! SERAFIN Your intuition matches your beauty . ( She smiles at him ) We give a performance tonight . ISABELLA GALVEZ You 'll give no performance in this town . SERAFIN Why not ? We are here . ISABELLA GALVEZ You ca n't give a performance without a license . SERAFIN A formality  --  a stroke of the pen . ISABELLA GALVEZ You can only get it from old Pedro Vargas . SERAFIN And he ? ISABELLA GALVEZ He 's inhospitable to strangers . Those who have any dealings with him whatever often cast doubt on his legitimacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his birth would make him sympathize with the unexpected . ISABELLA GALVEZ ( Laughs . Points to MANUELA'Shouse ) See that balcony SERAFIN Juliet 's balcony ISABELLA GALVEZ ( Sardonic ) Where Juliet 's petticoat hangs by yonder washline SERAFIN ( Struck ) A new idea ! ISABELLA GALVEZ A new idea for what ? SERAFIN When I play Romeo  --  I shall festoon the balcony with clotheslines . It will satisfy the intelligentsia who clamor for realism ! All I ask of you is to introduce me to the Censor . I 'll undertake to do the rest . ISABELLA GALVEZ He hates me . I corrupt his wife . I give her books to read . ( LIZARDA appears in MANUELA 'S doorway . ) SERAFIN He must be taught a lesson , this reactionary . LIZARDA Did you ring our bell , sir ? ISABELLA GALVEZ Oh , Lizarda LIZARDA Please , Seora ! p. 38 ISABELLA GALVEZ What 's the matter with you ? LIZARDA My master has forbidden me to converse with you . I disrecognize you . ISABELLA GALVEZ Oh , you do , eh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoration of LIZARDA . He gazes at her lovingly , all during this scene . ) LIZARDA Please do not embarrass me . ISABELLA GALVEZ You see , I 'm not good enough to speak to their maid , and my husband  --  rest his soul  --  was an alderman ! LIZARDA Please , Seora ! ISABELLA GALVEZ ( Starting down steps ) I 've a good mind to blacken that pretty little eye of yours ! SERAFIN No vandalism , gracious lady . She 's a sweet girl . LIZARDA Thank you , sir . SERAFIN Tell your master that Serafin of Madrid wishes to see him . It is important and immediate ! LIZARDA I shall be glad to apprise him , sir . ( She goes in . ) SERAFIN ( Admonishing TRILLO ) Trillo , Trillo . Oh , in the spring , in the spring ( To ISABELLA ) In the spring , a girl is a wonderful thing , in the spring Are you free this evening ? p. 39 ISABELLA GALVEZ I could be , though I had promised two lieutenants SERAFIN Bring them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no performance . That leaves you free , does n't it ? I could be free too . ( PEDRO comes out on his little porch and watches them . ) SERAFIN But the two lieutenants would be devastated . ISABELLA GALVEZ They 're new recruits . SERAFIN Happy pupils ! PEDRO VARGAS ( Bursting in  --  to ISABELLA ) You 've found your level , I see . ISABELLA GALVEZ ( With a devastating smile at SERAFIN ) I hope so . ( She goes out . ) PEDRO VARGAS Well , mountebank ? SERAFIN I am Serafin of Madrid . PEDRO VARGAS So I 've heard . SERAFIN I am a stranger in your city . PEDRO VARGAS You will remain so . SERAFIN I am an artist . These gentlemen ( He indicates his troupe , drooping in the back . The players stiffen up and bow ) are artists also . We are masters of many skills , of song and of speech . I tell the past , present and future . We wish to give a performance here . Will you , as the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 40 PEDRO VARGAS ( Dumbfounded at the request ) Your patron ! SERAFIN Will you so win a modest immortality ? PEDRO VARGAS Ten minutes ! SERAFIN My lord ? PEDRO VARGAS I give you and your malodorous riffraff there exactly ten minutes to get out of town . SERAFIN My lord ! PEDRO VARGAS I am not a lord . I am a hard-headed business man . Flattery wo n't get you anywhere with me . SERAFIN My lord , I shall be under no pretense with you . We are artists . We are children . But fame has not yet touched us , not even lightly . Are we to be exiled for that ? Look at my aidede - camp , Trillo  --  his songs express a naive delight in sheer existence . Bolo juggles marvelously . Sambo strums a guitar and sets the feet to dancing . For a moment he will quicken the slow rhythm of your lives . Give us this moment . For , unless we perform , we do not live . Do not imprison our skills . Let us express ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PEDRO VARGAS Ten minutes ! SERAFIN What , sir ? ( Gradually , with accumulating and tantalizing force , something about PEDRO starts clamping on SERAFIN a gnawing pincer of memory . He stares at him . He withdraws from him . He stares at him from a farther perspective . He starts , in a wide arc , to encircle him. ) p. 41 PEDRO VARGAS I give you exactly ten minutes to get out of this town . This is a respectable community . We do not entertain the scum of the cities . It is to get away from such as you that we live here . When I opened my window just now I sniffed in the wind a whiff of corruption . I see now what it is . You and your starvelings ! Get out , do you hear ? Ten minutes to get out . Ten minutes ! SERAFIN Speak more , master , speak more . PEDRO VARGAS I 'll have you in jail . And it 's a mean jail . As lousy as you are . SERAFIN Speak  --  speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? SERAFIN No , I am dreaming . I am dreaming  --  no . PEDRO VARGAS Ten minutes to get out  --  you and your troupe . Ten minutes . ( SERAFIN leaps up on top of the cart . His troupe huddle around . From behind PEDRO , with startling suddenness , comes a voice , seemingly out of the air . It says loudly , clearly : ) SERAFIN Mene Mene Tekel Upharsin . ( SERAFIN and his troupe echo this voice in an eerie ululation . This vocal apparition has an extraordinary effect on PEDRO . He jumps as if shot . He grows pale . He clutches his heart . Beads of perspiration stand out on his forehead. ) p. 42 PEDRO VARGAS ( Agonized ) Merciful Mother of God ! SERAFIN ( In a terrible voice ) Indeed , my lord Pedro , the handwriting on the wall ! PEDRO VARGAS Merciful Mother SERAFIN ( In the same voice ) The Devil is dying , my lord Pedro . The devil is dying . ( Pantherlike and commanding now , he addresses the troupe ) Gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , north or south ? East or west ? SERAFIN Publicize our performance this evening . DON BOLO What 's the use publicizing what ai n't gon na be ? SERAFIN Leave that to me . ESTABAN We 've left it to you till the starvation point . SERAFIN One more act of faith . DON BOLO All right , but it 's the last act . SERAFIN Do as I say , Trillo . TRILLO ( Obedience is instant ; saluting ) Your word , Captain , is my law . ( SERAFIN and PEDRO are left alone . Trembling , PEDRO crosses himself. ) p. 43 PEDRO VARGAS ( Shattered ) Where was it  --  did I hear it ? SERAFIN Would you like to hear it again ? PEDRO VARGAS No , no ! Are you the Devil ? Are you the Devil ? SERAFIN ( Jumping down and coming close to PEDRO to accuse him ) He is much nearer , I think , to you  --  Estramudo . PEDRO VARGAS ( In a paralysis of panic ) Shh  --  for the sake of SERAFIN Truly it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 've changed . You 've become respectable , Estramudo . PEDRO VARGAS I beg you  --  I beg you SERAFIN What are you doing here ? Does n't it bore you ? After all those years on the seven seas ! Does n't it bore you , after murder and torture , and drowning , and booty  --  endless booty ? What do you do evenings , Estramudo ? PEDRO VARGAS Merciful Mother of God ! SERAFIN All I ask is a license for our show  --  that 's a small price for silence , Estramudo . PEDRO VARGAS Do n't say that name . p. 44 SERAFIN My , my , but you 've put on weight . When we last met  --  you were lithe  --  you were strong . PEDRO VARGAS You did it ! When you captured me . That made me turn over a new leaf . If you had n't been on that ship ! How did you come to be there ? SERAFIN I was returning from Algiers where I had just fulfilled , with resounding success  --  I may say  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship . SERAFIN We gave you a strong fight , Estramudo . PEDRO VARGAS Sh SERAFIN You were about to decapitate our officer . My voice from an unexpected quarter  --  Mene PEDRO VARGAS Sh SERAFIN Tell me , why did that mystical abracadabra frighten you so ? PEDRO VARGAS ( Pitifully ) I 'm superstitious ! SERAFIN That 's putting it mildly . You were terrified . PEDRO VARGAS It was that sound that came from nowhere  --  that terrible sound . SERAFIN It 's one of our best effects . What 's the matter with it ? p. 45 PEDRO VARGAS I heard that sound once before in Baghdad , when I was condemned to die . I associate it with the call of the muezzin  --  the muezzin of death . SERAFIN Really ! PEDRO VARGAS How did you know it ? How ? SERAFIN I do n't give away any professional secrets , but in confidence I will tell you this  --  I am the seventh son of a seventh son , and born with a veil . It is rumored that Cagliastro was my father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lifted from the caul by levitation . Now you tell me something ? I was going to share the reward with the captain ; he had you safely below decks in chains . How did you escape ? PEDRO VARGAS Bribery . SERAFIN But you had nothing on you . We 'd searched you thoroughly . PEDRO VARGAS I swallowed two rubies . SERAFIN Luxurious diet . And since ? PEDRO VARGAS I 'd had enough . I came here with my capital . SERAFIN ( Ironically ) Whose capital ? PEDRO VARGAS My capital . Are you a communist ? SERAFIN No . No . And then ? p. 46 PEDRO VARGAS As you see . Quiet life . Regular meals . Philanthropy . SERAFIN Do n't you miss the old life ? PEDRO VARGAS I hate it . I loathe it . I never thought of it till now . But you ca n't prove it . You ca n't prove anything . Remember that . ( SERAFIN bursts out laughing . He laughs uncontrollably ) What are you laughing at ? SERAFIN So this is Estramudo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seas ! The novelist 's gold-mine , the poet 's inspiration  --  you ! PEDRO VARGAS If you denounce me , I 'll say you 're crazy . I 'll have you locked up . SERAFIN Do we get the license ? PEDRO VARGAS ( Turns , starts to walk away ) No ! SERAFIN ( Singing ) Mene , Mene , Tekel Upharsin . PEDRO VARGAS ( As though kicked in stomach ) Do n't do that ! SERAFIN Do we get it ? PEDRO VARGAS For one performance . On condition you get out right after . SERAFIN I have no wish to remain here , Estramudo . My desire for respectability is not as great as yours . p. 47 PEDRO VARGAS But it 's understood  --  you leave immediately after the performance tonight . SERAFIN ( Again overcome with laughter ) Estramudo , the Censor ! I ca n't bear it . ( PEDRO starts across the stage ) Where are you going , Prince of Pirates ? PEDRO VARGAS ( Wiping his brow , crosses himself ) To Mass ! ( He exits in the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amused . He is in terrific fettle . He looks around him , at the Square , at the houses . Somehow he feels that this little square will be for him a gladiatorial arena from which he will emerge victorious . TRILLO shambles back . ) SERAFIN ( Improvising to himself ) Ladies and Gentlemen . At the especial request of the Alcalde , Don Pedro Hello , Trillo . TRILLO Hello , Captain . I 've publicized my head off , but my pronouncements has been received with skepticism . SERAFIN Tonight , Trillo , marks the turn of our fortunes . TRILLO ( With admiration ) That 's what makes you a nacherl leader , Captain . You 're more than jes sanguine , you 're contagious . p. 48 SERAFIN Distribute handbills  --  to this effect : Tonight our performance takes place under the patronage of the Alcalde Don Pedro Vargas himself . TRILLO ( Amazed ) Shu nuff ! SERAFIN Sure as spring , my Trillo . TRILLO ( Not quite convinced ) Where do you get that certitude ? SERAFIN There are days when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible becomes a pushover . This is one of those days ! ( MANUELA comes out of her house . She wears a lovely Spanish costume . She looks exquisite . She carries a reticule and a parasol . She puts up her parasol ; the two stare at her . TRILLO emits a long , admiring whistle and exits . MANUELA starts across the stage , moving demurely . SERAFIN starts a concentric circling of her . She finds herself facing him . The few musicians in the neighborhood tinkle a sympathetic obligato to this scene for a while . ) SERAFIN ( Finally ) Are you a maiden ? ( She stops , startled , does not look at him . His voice trembling ) For me it is as vital as a heartbeat to know . MANUELA VARGAS ( Icily crisp ) In Madrid , I hear , the ladies do not walk without their duennas . Must we introduce that custom into this hitherto peaceful village ? Here at least I should have thought bodyguards were unnecessary . p. 49 SERAFIN Were you to walk the lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost , described by Dante , were the universe all but extinct , some ultimate spark of life there would kindle dangerously as you passed . You , gracious lady , will always need a bodyguard . From the boatman of the Styx , from Charon himself . Do not look at him . Do not catch his eye . He will scuttle his ferry . MANUELA VARGAS ( After a moment ) You are very extravagant . SERAFIN Do not lengthen my suspense . Who are you ? MANUELA VARGAS I am a wife . ( At this horrific announcement , the music stops . ) SERAFIN ( Affronted , angry ) Then you should never step into the sight of other men . It is a provocation not to be endured . MANUELA VARGAS I shall remove the provocation . ( She starts to move on . SERAFIN is struck by a horrid thought . ) SERAFIN Wait . No  --  no  --  it ca n't be ! That would be too grotesque . Oh , gracious lady , tell me that is n't true . MANUELA VARGAS I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny  --  but if it will make you feel better if I do deny it , then I see no reason why I should n't . Have it your own way . Whatever it is  --  it is not true . Good day , Seor . ( She starts on , but she finds him again before her. ) p. 50 SERAFIN Not him . Of all men in the world , not him . MANUELA VARGAS Very well . Not him . Not him . SERAFIN ( In agony ) Yes . It is he  --  it is he . MANUELA VARGAS You vacillate so . SERAFIN You 're not married to him  --  not to that mountainous MANUELA VARGAS ( Very cold , imperious ) Don Pedro Vargas is my husband and you will do well not to malign him or his wrath may be turned upon you , to say nothing of mine . SERAFIN His wrath upon me ! MANUELA VARGAS He is an amiable friend , but a vindictive enemy . SERAFIN ( His voice rises ) What of my wrath against him ! MANUELA VARGAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? SERAFIN He defies the eternal principle of the rightness of things . It is a personal affront . MANUELA VARGAS You 're insane . SERAFIN If he had had any fastidiousness , he would have known that you were not for him . He would have stood aside . p. 51 MANUELA VARGAS ( Amused now ) For you , I suppose ? SERAFIN For someone aware of what you are . MANUELA VARGAS Like you , for instance . SERAFIN ( Tensely ) Yes . MANUELA VARGAS Are n't you expecting too much of him ? After all  --  he 's not clairvoyant . SERAFIN Neither a sense of his future , nor a memory of his past . Neither sight nor sense . Neither feeling nor scruple . MANUELA VARGAS You know him ? SERAFIN Yes , I know him . MANUELA VARGAS You are impertinent then to speak so of him . I will not listen . Good day . Now let me pass . SERAFIN ( Dreamily ) On the other hand , I should be grateful MANUELA VARGAS You should be grateful that he allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood aside and another had come  --  the discrepancy might be less marked , and my suit more hopeless . MANUELA VARGAS ( Taunting him ) It 's a suit , is it ? p. 52 SERAFIN ( Quietly ) It is a suit which I shall pursue to its end . ( Calmly ) Henceforth , all my thoughts will be of you . My longings sluiced now in one deep current of desire . What is your name ? MANUELA VARGAS Donna Vargas . SERAFIN No , not his name  --  your name . MANUELA VARGAS Manuela SERAFIN Manuela ! MANUELA VARGAS Now , please let me go . You 're very entertaining . I like you . You 're nice  --  a little flamboyant , perhaps  --  and certainly not well balanced  --  but nice  --  and I 'm not at all sure you 're sincere , but whether you are or not , you 're nice . Now , please let me go . SERAFIN Where do you go ? MANUELA VARGAS ( Laughing a little at herself , walks away  --  he walks beside her ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the sea  --  to read . SERAFIN To read ! ( He takes hold of her parasol as if to help her and presently she relinquishes it so that he finds himself holding it over her . ) MANUELA VARGAS ( Explaining breathlessly ) Yes . You see , at home I get no chance whatever to read . My husband 's a very fine man ! p. 53 SERAFIN A very generous man . MANUELA VARGAS Oh , I love him dearly  --  but he 's something of a hypochondriac and I have to watch him  --  like a  --  sentinel  --  for symptoms . Then there are the servants and household decisions and callers . SERAFIN Your husband is quite a prominent man ? MANUELA VARGAS Quite the most prominent in the village , you might say  --  and the house is always full of people . SERAFIN And so you have to run away . MANUELA VARGAS Yes , at the moment my husband is at Mass . Oh , he 's very religious . SERAFIN I 'm sure ! MANUELA VARGAS Oh , he 's admirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ? MANUELA VARGAS Yes , you could call him a paragon . ( She walks away from him and starts down the steps , but he darts around and meets her as she reaches the foot of the steps ) You 'll never get anywhere with me by deprecating him . In fact it rather puts me off . ( As he confronts her suddenly ) We do meet so often lately . p. 54 SERAFIN I do n't deprecate him . Of all men in the world , I think he is the most enviable . MANUELA VARGAS Thank you . You do pay pretty compliments . If you know him , perhaps he 'll invite you to tea and then we could meet under more SERAFIN Proper auspices . MANUELA VARGAS Yes . I see you understand . Good day , Seor . ( She starts off . ) SERAFIN ( Stopping her again ) When you get to your little retreat  --  what is it you read ? MANUELA VARGAS Oh , I 'm afraid you 'd think it rather silly . My husband does . SERAFIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MANUELA VARGAS I 'm reading the sayings of Marcus Aurelius . SERAFIN ( Skeptically ) The sayings of Marcus Aurelius . I do n't believe you . Show me what you read . MANUELA VARGAS ( Taking out ESTRAMUDO 'S book ) Well , at the moment I am reading this one . Have you read it ? ( She gives him the book . He opens it , looks at it , looks at her . He looks at her sharply . Is she having him on ? Is it conceivable that she is innocent ? Warily , he questions her. ) p. 55 SERAFIN Do you know this man ? MANUELA VARGAS Know him  --  Estramudo ! Marooned here as I am , how could I know him ? SERAFIN Have you ever seen him ? MANUELA VARGAS Oh , yes  --  often ! SERAFIN You 've seen him often ! MANUELA VARGAS In my mind 's eye . SERAFIN Oh , only there ? MANUELA VARGAS How else ? Where else ? SERAFIN What is there about this man that seizes your imagination ? MANUELA VARGAS ( Clasps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transcends reality . SERAFIN And what good does that do you ? MANUELA VARGAS What good ? How prosaic ! You sound like Pedro . SERAFIN Oh , no . I have wild dreams about myself also , but they 're extensions of myself . I never substitute another hero for myself  --  especially one as remote as this Estramudo must be to you . MANUELA VARGAS He is not remote . He is near to me . I live with him . p. 56 SERAFIN You live with him ! MANUELA VARGAS Figuratively speaking . ( He circles her , he feels his mind reeling a bit ) I do wish you 'd stop circling around me like that  --  it 's like talking to a top . SERAFIN You bewilder me . MANUELA VARGAS I 'm a hero-worshiper . I once had a crush on Napoleon . My aunt knew him . She grew up with him in Corsica . I sent him some fruit once to St. Helena . SERAFIN Did he acknowledge it ? MANUELA VARGAS ( Sadly ) No , he never did . SERAFIN But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his head ? MANUELA VARGAS Do n't be a prude ! These little ethical straitjackets ca n't hold in a man like Estramudo . SERAFIN No , that 's true  --  they ca n't ! MANUELA VARGAS On the moving waters he darts about , this dragon-fly of the seas , glittering and uncapturable . In bold strokes , like a fresco of Michael Angelo , he has slashed across the world the great pattern of his imaginations , a superb design of adventure for men to marvel and wonder at . p. 57 SERAFIN You are in love with this man ? MANUELA VARGAS In a way . SERAFIN But what if you knew him ? MANUELA VARGAS The question is academic . SERAFIN But if you did  --  if you met him ? MANUELA VARGAS It would depend a bit on what he looked like , would n't it ? His manners ? After all , he personally might be quite disenchanting  --  even a bore . How do I know ? SERAFIN Well , you 're the most extraordinary mixture of fantasy and realism it has ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? I do n't think so . There is the practical world and the world of the imagination . I know which is which . I do n't mix them . SERAFIN I do n't agree . If your imagination does n't bring reality , then it 's a mere lie  --  a mere delusion . MANUELA VARGAS You 're a pragmatist . To me imagination is just an escape . The less it has to do with reality the better . That is its essence . SERAFIN What I mean is this . As we sit here together , side by side , my mind leaps forward to that moment , to that marvelous moment p. 58 MANUELA VARGAS Please do not leap . It will do you no good to leap . I am a married woman . SERAFIN That seems to be your slogan . MANUELA VARGAS My husband is very kind to me , and I do hope I have a sense of fair play . SERAFIN A Lorelei with a conscience ! For a woman so addicted to the niceties of equity you certainly pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick them as remote from myself as possible . Good day , Seor . Oh , dear  --  I 've talked to you for so long now , I 'm afraid I 'll have no time left to read . ( She gets up , forgetting her parasol , and starts toward her house . But again she finds herself confronted by SERAFIN ) You do get about in the oddest way ! SERAFIN But if he were not ? MANUELA VARGAS If he were not what ? SERAFIN This Estramudo , if you met him  --  and he were personally on a par with his deeds  --  not a bore at all  --  took his career for granted  --  never mentioned it , in fact  --  were entertaining , fascinating  --  even lovable on his own MANUELA VARGAS Oh , dear ! p. 59 SERAFIN ( Insisting passionately ) What then ? MANUELA VARGAS That might be difficult to resist . SERAFIN But you would try ? MANUELA VARGAS I should succeed . SERAFIN You are sure of yourself ! MANUELA VARGAS Yes . SERAFIN But why ? Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VARGAS ( Laughs ) You see , do you ? SERAFIN Do n't laugh at me . MANUELA VARGAS If I did n't laugh , I should be annoyed with you . Now please let me pass . SERAFIN Never . MANUELA VARGAS Do n't be silly . SERAFIN I love you . And love is not silly . MANUELA VARGAS ( Soberly , analytically ) No . Love is not silly . But most of the prattle about it is . Now please let me go . SERAFIN You do n't believe me ? p. 60 MANUELA VARGAS If you had met Isabella there you would have said it to her . SERAFIN I did meet her . MANUELA VARGAS ( A little piqued ) Oh . SERAFIN And I made a rendezvous with her  --  somewhat elastic . MANUELA VARGAS Oh , you did . SERAFIN But I did not say it to her . MANUELA VARGAS ( Trying to pass ) Good-bye . SERAFIN Shall I prove that I love you ? MANUELA VARGAS Love is not a problem in geometry . How can you prove it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your hands . MANUELA VARGAS Why should you do that ? SERAFIN Because I want it there . MANUELA VARGAS What would I do with it ? SERAFIN What you will . MANUELA VARGAS It 's a responsibility . It 's sweet of you . But thank you , no . SERAFIN You 're not curious ? p. 61 MANUELA VARGAS ( In spite of herself ) Who are you anyway ? SERAFIN If I tell you  --  the responsibility will be yours already . Can you bear it ? MANUELA VARGAS You 're very strange . SERAFIN Stranger even than your dreams . MANUELA VARGAS ( Drawn in against her will ) Who are you ? SERAFIN ( In a whisper ) I am the stuff of your dreams materialized . I am he about whom your imagination plays . I am  --  I am Estramudo the Pirate . ( There is a long pause . She looks at him . ) MANUELA VARGAS You said just now that I was a mixture of fantasy and realism . I am now in my mood of realism . SERAFIN You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . She half does ) No . SERAFIN You know it to be true . MANUELA VARGAS ( Playing for time ) So you think you are presentable , do you ? SERAFIN This disguise is hardly becoming . You should see me dressed up . p. 62 MANUELA VARGAS Fascinating  --  even lovable ! SERAFIN Oh , do n't turn my words against me , Manuela . MANUELA VARGAS Why not ? SERAFIN When I spoke them I had no idea of revealing my identity to you . MANUELA VARGAS I think where women are concerned you are pretty calculating . Keep your engagement with Isabella . ( MANUELA opens the door quickly and slams it in his face . He finds himself alone . He tries the door . It is locked . He tries it harder . It is definitely locked . We hear the staccato drumming of SERAFIN 'S troupe  --  a droning vibration punctured in regular , insistent rhythm . He withdraws , looks at MANUELA 'S house , at ISABELLA 'S house  --  surveying the terrain . TRILLO comes back . After him straggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) TRILLO ( Very excited ) Captain , Captain ! I have pontificated our performance and there is a certain interest . SERAFIN ( Still looking up at MANUELA 'S balcony ) Good , Trillo ! DON BOLO It 's more than an interest  --  it 's an apprehension . p. 63 TRILLO We shall gratify it ! DON BOLO It 's the first show since Don Pedro has been the Alcalde . TRILLO They think as the Alcalde allows it , it must be good . We have the great virtue of novelty . DON BOLO Maybe we 'll even be able to buy a couple of fish . SERAFIN ( Snaps out of his revery  --  the man of action again ) After tonight , my hearties , there will be a plentitude of fish . Set for the show , boys . TRILLO ( A little surprised ) Right here ? In the residential quarter ? It 's more crowded up the hill . SERAFIN The crowd will come to us , Trillo . Not we to the crowd . TRILLO That has not been our experience so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you saw that lady there TRILLO Yes , Captain . SERAFIN She has a maid . TRILLO We have exchanged glances . SERAFIN To her I want you to convey that I am not Serafin the Player at all but Estramudo the Pirate . ( To BOLO ) Bolo , that rope will do very well to hang our props on . ( He indicates the clothesline on MANUELA 'S balcony . BOLO grabs it and trails it over to SERAFIN. ) p. 64 TRILLO ( Stunned ) Estramudo the Pirate ! SERAFIN Can I entrust this to you ? TRILLO ( Aghast ) But that 's fraught with peril , Captain . Suppose she distributes it ? SERAFIN I want her to . I want her to tell it all over town . TRILLO Oh , Captain , you 've got me all confused . SERAFIN Leave the strategy to me . You be the executant . TRILLO If they catch me  --  I 'll sure be the executant . SERAFIN ( He eyes the space between the two houses ) Trust me , Trillo , trust me . TRILLO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He takes MANUELA 'S rope from BOLO . ) ESTABAN Gon na do the rope trick tonight , Captain ? SERAFIN May go back to my iron-jaw act . Tonight , boys , we must be good . We must . ( Testing rope ) Oh , this will do excellently ; it will do very well indeed . ( Hands rope to TRILLO and crosses to the trellis leading up to ISABELLA 'S balcony . To the musicians : ) Give me a roll and a chord in G. ( He does a knee bend and starts climbing trellis ) Bolo , my boy , I may chop you in two tonight . p. 65 DON BOLO ( Reminiscently ) You ai n't chopped me in a long time , Captain . SERAFIN ( As he climbs ) We 're going to do a lot of things tonight that we have n't done in a long time . DON BOLO ( To TRILLO ) The thermometer sure is rising ! I ai n't ever seen him climb for it before . Lucky the lady is a widow , eh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold with such petty gossip . Besides , the boss 's lady do n't live in this house  --  ( Pointing to ISABELLA 'S ) she lives in that house . ( Pointing to MANUELA 'S . By this time SERAFIN is on ISABELLA 'S balcony , tying the rope to the railing and facing MANUELA 'S house . ) SERAFIN ( Addressing the Universe ) From this house to that house  --  from the profane to the sacred  --  from the body to the spirit  --  from earth to heaven  --  ( Suddenly the vision strikes him  --  he sees the stretched rope  --  a straight rope to MANUELA 'S bedroom ) Oh , oho , I wish  --  I wish ! TRILLO ( Apprehensive ) What 's wrong , Captain ? Scared of the height ? p. 66 SERAFIN No , I eat the air , promise-crammed ( He takes off his shoes . ) TRILLO Are you dizzy , Captain ? SERAFIN Yes , I 'm dizzy . Throw me that umbrella . ( TRILLO tosses MANUELA 'S parasol up to him ) I 'm dizzy with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heaven . ( His men think he has gone crazy , they are worried ) It 's a road to heaven  --  a straight and narrow road to heaven . ( SERAFIN starts walking the tight-rope to MANUELA 'S balcony . ) DON BOLO He 's gettin ' religion ! He 's goin ' to heaven ! ( In an ecstasy the troupe starts clapping its hands and improvising a rousing spiritual as SERAFIN , balancing with MANUELA 'S parasol , walks the improvised tight-rope . The song and the rhythm mount and mount as SERAFIN teeters crazily on the clothesline . Partly for the sake of those actors who are not congenital tight-rope walkers , a " transparency curtain " may descend ( as , in fact , it does on the current production of this play ! ) , a curtain obligingly cut so as to minimize the risk for the perilously peripatetic SERAFIN . We see his head , his arms and shoulders dizzily balancing with MANUELA 'S parasol : painted on the curtain Reubens-like , beneficent colored angels , their arms raised in supplication , help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the God Eros guides him . MANUELA 'S bedroom : lavishly baroque ; green and yellow ; a great , heavily pillared canopy bed , an ornate fortress . On the right , a tall , French window , curtained , which leads out onto the balcony . It is to this balcony that SERAFIN has improvised his highway from ISABELLA 'S balcony . The action is overlapping . We hear the singing and the shouting that , at the end of the first act , accompany SERAFIN 'S maneuver . INES and CAPUCHO are shooting craps . She is playing and talking and winning . She has been winning for some time . CAPUCHO is miserable , gaunt and resentful . He plays desperately , trying to get a break under the barrage of his wife 's chatter . They are on their hands and knees on the floor . INES ( As CAPUCHO rolls ) Ah , four ! Come on , come on  --  better luck next time , beloved mummy . ( She is impatient , waiting for CAPUCHO to roll when music is heard through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someone 's serenading me ! ( She darts to balcony curtains , peers out ) What I see ! Your daughter 's talking to a stranger . That 's indiscreet of her . He 's very handsome . She should turn him over to me . Pedro 's not jealous of me . ( Trots back and kneels ) I shall speak to her . I shall reprimand her . p. 68 CAPUCHO There are a lot of strangers in town  --  very noisy  --  very noisy  --  INES Well , rhubarb-stalk , why do n't you roll ? ( CAPUCHO rolls ) Ah , Cobra 's peepers  --  you are not in the vein , my pumpkin seed  --  you are not in the vein . ( CAPUCHO goes to the window , peers out . INES picks up the dice , shakes them elaborately ) You 're too tense , my peanut . Play casually . ( She exchanges dice ) When I play I think of something else . How I will look at Easter . Wo n't I be beautiful ? CAPUCHO ( Returning from window ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throws dice . ) INES Two hundred pesos  --  little dice , buy me this robe my heart longs for . ( She peers at them ) Ah ! Six ! ( CAPUCHO starts to pick up the dice for her ) I 'll pick them up ! ( She rolls again ) Ah ! Four and two . ( CAPUCHO wants to kill her ) You see , Capucho . I do n't even think about it . Well , that 's all . Pay up , dried apricot . My robe , my beautiful robe is paid for . CAPUCHO One more . INES To increase your losses ? No  --  you should n't play this game . It 's not your metir . Pay up ! p. 69 CAPUCHO You 've got to give me a chance to win back . INES Two hundred pesos . Forty I have  --  a hundred and eighty you owe me . With the rest I will buy you something . CAPUCHO Do n't buy me anything  --  it will cost me too much . INES Shall I get you earrings like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tar that 's had fifty years of service . Or would you prefer a tattoo ? I 'll stand you a tattoo , ( CAPUCHO , ready to roll , picks up dice , weighs them , realizes they are loaded . ) CAPUCHO Loaded ! You cheat your own husband ! INES I have no prejudices . Let it be a lesson to you . ( The noise of the tumult in the square comes in through the window ) What a noise outside ! What a tumult ! ( She runs again to the window ) Those men have taken possession of the whole square . ( MANUELA has come in with LIZARDA . She is very warm . She starts at once the process of disrobing , taking one garment off after another . Then with LIZARDA 'S help she puts on a negligee which she has on by the time SERAFIN enters . ) MANUELA VARGAS ( In despair ) How often do I have to beg you two to stay in your own apartments ? Twenty rooms in this house and not an inch to myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loaded ! INES Ah  --  flirt  --  flirt  --  and in the public square too ! CAPUCHO Loaded ! INES To belabor the obvious , daughter , your father is a dunce . MANUELA VARGAS And to think that when I woke this morning I was at peace . INES What troubles you , daughter ? The tall stranger , perhaps ? Ah , that is a sign of youth  --  that is a sign of vitality . When we 're not troubled , we might as well be dead . I 'm glad for you , daughter . CAPUCHO Loaded ! I see it now , Manuela , she 's been playing me with loaded dice for years . She 's been cheating me for years . MANUELA VARGAS Please , Father , go away , and take Mother with you . INES You request the minnow to remove the whale . CAPUCHO ( Wailing ) My wife  --  my own wife ! INES I 'm standing him a tattoo . His chest is so narrow it wo n't take a panorama . It will have to be a miniature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . ( INES goes to window. ) p. 71 INES Oh ! Oh ! Look , Manuela ! Oh ! Oh ! ( SERAFIN calmly steps into the room from the balcony . In one hand he carries MANUELA 'S parasol ; his shoes in the other . INES retreats , then advances toward him with a little cry . MANUELA pales , stares at him . ) SERAFIN I sense in this room an atmosphere of strangulated discomfort . These must be relatives . Wo n't you introduce me ? MANUELA VARGAS Unfortunately , I do not know your name . SERAFIN Oh , yes , I think you do . I took the trouble to tell it to you My name is MANUELA VARGAS ( Does n't want him to tell ) Unfortunately it has escaped my mind . ( Introducing ) My mother and my father . SERAFIN How do you do ? INES Have you an appointment ? SERAFIN I happened to be in the neighborhood . I thought I 'd drop in . She left her umbrella . INES You take a great deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gets about in the oddest way ! INES He walked the rope . How interesting ! There , filbert , is a man ! p. 72 CAPUCHO ( Offering dice ) Roll ? SERAFIN No , thank you . I never gamble before lunch . INES ( Flirting ) Are you staying for lunch ? SERAFIN ( Declining politely ) Well , I do n't know  --  perhaps INES Manuela , invite him to lunch . MANUELA VARGAS You do n't have to invite him ! CAPUCHO ( Happy ) Then we 'll roll after lunch . Wo n't you put on your shoes and stay ? SERAFIN Thank you very much . I am not a gentleman of leisure . I INES ( Following up ) And after lunch we could go for a drive in the country by ourselves . Would you like that ? SERAFIN I 'm sorry . MANUELA VARGAS ( Relieved ) You see , Mother , he wo n't take yes for an answer . INES I 'm not a hag , you know . My arms and shoulders are still beautiful . SERAFIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivalry ? p. 73 INES Are you married ? SERAFIN ( Looking straight at MANUELA ) I am engaged . INES Fortunate girl ! SERAFIN Thank you , mother-in-law . MANUELA VARGAS What an imagination ! Stops at nothing ! SERAFIN ( To INES ) I am a visionary like your daughter , only slightly more practical . INES I see the way things are blowing . ( To MANUELA ) Chickadee , are you sly ? Remember on which side our bread is buttered ! Do n't trifle with my future ! MANUELA VARGAS Do n't worry , Mother . Pedro will be home any minute . I imagine by then our guest will have departed to his  --  more important activities . SERAFIN ( Looking at her ) Yes . But not alone . INES I 'll be glad to go with you  --  anywhere . SERAFIN Thank you . INES Now , do n't be tiresome . Stay for lunch . Pedro will adore you . SERAFIN I 'm sure . p. 74 INES We 'll have a battle of wits . Epigrams will flow . CAPUCHO And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know your name . We ca n't just say , " This is a gentleman who came in through the window , " can we ? What is your name ? MANUELA VARGAS ( To protect SERAFIN ) He prefers to remain incognito . INES ( Delighted ) Incognito ! Have you done something ? How wonderful ! SERAFIN I am Estramudo the Pirate . INES Merciful Mother of God ! CAPUCHO ( On the run ) I 'll fetch Pedro ! ( He disappears . ) SERAFIN My time is limited . I have a performance to give . I 'm afraid you must leave us alone . MANUELA VARGAS Do n't leave us . SERAFIN ( Grabbing MANUELA by the wrists ) There is a practical side to successful piracy that you do not visualize in your dreams . You might as well get used to it . MANUELA VARGAS Mother , you must stay . p. 75 INES ( Making for the door ) He does n't want me . ( She returns ; she keeps making little runs between SERAFIN and the door ) The fact is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business arrangement , contrived by me . It 's time she had a little fling . Have a little fling , daughter . I 'll watch for Pedro . It will ease my conscience . ( Toddles back again , to SERAFIN ) I 'm sympathetic , are n't I ? May I touch you ? My other son-in-law adores me . ( She flutters out . ) SERAFIN ( Takes a step toward MANUELA ) Well , Manuela , we meet again . MANUELA VARGAS At least once too often . SERAFIN Do n't trifle with me , madame . It is not lightly I have revealed my identity . All the jackals in the province will scent prey . If I have risked this much for another sight of you , do you think I will stop now ? MANUELA VARGAS Bandit ! Murderer ! If you come near me I 'll scream . SERAFIN Why should you scream ? I 'm prepared to be charming to you . ( Takes up book which MANUELA has left on the bed ) Let 's see what he has to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have misunderstood me . I was naive enough to talk to you as I would to  --  a friend . This is how you repay me  --  by rushing into my room like a robber baron . This is not the Middle Ages , you know . ( She makes an attempt to retrieve the book ) Give me my book . SERAFIN Inadequate . Totally inadequate . MANUELA VARGAS I 'll never forgive you for this arrogance . SERAFIN Does he think it 's as easy as this  --  this scribbler ? Does n't he realize , this dilettante  --  ( He taps the book contemptuously ) does n't he realize that piracy on the scale on which I practice it is big business ? It 's a desk job ! I assure you , Manuela , that from dawn to dusk and all through the night I slave in my cabin over graphs and meteorological tables and astrolabes . No exercise . As a result I suffer terribly from heartburn . MANUELA VARGAS Every minute you remind me more of Pedro . Except that he is less conceited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harem episode . MANUELA VARGAS You escaped with nine wives , did n't you ? SERAFIN Yes . p. 77 MANUELA VARGAS Were you happy  --  the ten of you ? SERAFIN When you run away with nine women , it seldom lasts . ( Taps the book again ) What he does n't seem to understand is that it was not I who escaped from the harem . I was very happy there  --  excellent food  --  a bit on the rich side  --  companionship  --  when I wanted it  --  I did n't escape  --  it was the women who escaped . MANUELA VARGAS ( Withering ) Wanted to get you to themselves , of course ? SERAFIN Partly . They spirited me away because they wanted my money , my horses and my knowledge of the terrain . MANUELA VARGAS Well , I 'm glad that your sense of total irresistibility wavers for once . ( SERAFINshuts the book and throws it on bed ) I shall never look at that book again . You 've spoiled it for me . SERAFIN Poor Manuela , the actuality that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible parents  --  no wonder you seek escape . Well , I have set a task for myself . To convert you to the beauty and excitement of reality . MANUELA VARGAS Personified in you ! p. 78 SERAFIN Yes . ( He looks at her a moment , then crosses to the door , looks it and puts the key in his pocket . ) MANUELA VARGAS ( Terrified ) What are you doing ? SERAFIN Ensuring privacy . MANUELA VARGAS Give me that key ! SERAFIN Sorry . MANUELA VARGAS ( Looks at him as if for the first time ) So this is the Great Estramudo ! Would-be lover who resorts to locked doors . Braggart . Complacent . Murders by graph . Drowns from a desk . Loots by logarithm . On what flimsy bases do reputations rest ! SERAFIN You forget one thing MANUELA VARGAS If your task was to disillusion me , I can assure you you have succeeded . I shall pick up where I left off with Napoleon . SERAFIN ( Pensively ) He gets heartburn . He 's a sedentary fellow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While he 's safe at St. Helena I can dream about him . Heroes must n't approach . You prove that . SERAFIN You forget I 'm risking my life for you . p. 79 MANUELA VARGAS ( Regards him narrowly ) Are n't you rather self-conscious about it ? SERAFIN ( Bursting out in fury ) Of course I 'm self-conscious . Of whom else should I be conscious ? I 'm all I 've got ! MANUELA VARGAS I sha n't increase your holdings . SERAFIN You drive me crazy . You know that , do n't you ? MANUELA VARGAS The solution is simple . A short walk , over that rope , to Isabella 's . SERAFIN Isabella seems to be on your mind . MANUELA VARGAS Yes , I 'm insanely jealous , do n't you see ? SERAFIN ( Quietly ) By scoffing at what you feel you will not diminish the irritation . MANUELA VARGAS How happy you must be ! SERAFIN ( Looks at her , calmly ) Not yet , but I will be . MANUELA VARGAS If you are this pirate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you confessed publicly to being the hunted Estramudo ? SERAFIN To interest you ! p. 80 MANUELA VARGAS You do n't think you could do it on your own ? SERAFIN I 'm a modest man . MANUELA VARGAS If I had read this in a book I should have thought : " How romantic ! How noble . " But as I see you , as I know you , I feel impatient that you should pay such a price  --  for a gesture ! SERAFIN ( With a swift glance toward the bed ) I had hoped , madame , for more than a gesture . MANUELA VARGAS ( Inexorable ) For a gesture ! SERAFIN You have a penchant for romance . I played romantic . MANUELA VARGAS It is all very well to play romantic , but in real life one wants common sense . You 're stupid not to see that . SERAFIN I thought common sense bored you . MANUELA VARGAS ( Wailing ) Do n't argue . Now that my mother knows who you are , it will be all over town in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fatal secret like that . MANUELA VARGAS Telling fatal secrets 's the breath of her nostrils . I implore you . Go . Get away while you can . p. 81 SERAFIN ( Flatly ) No . MANUELA VARGAS ( Desperate ) You wo n't go ? SERAFIN ( Finally ) Wo n't go ! MANUELA VARGAS ( Whispering ) Why  --  why ? SERAFIN Because it would be the height of idiocy to have put myself into this jeopardy  --  for nothing ! MANUELA VARGAS I am touched by your recklessness . SERAFIN That 's not enough . MANUELA VARGAS But if you 're captured and hanged SERAFIN The memory will suffice . But give me the memory . MANUELA VARGAS ( Making a desperate last stand ) No  --  no . SERAFIN Manuela  --  do not make me ridiculous  --  do not make me risk all  --  for nothing ! MANUELA VARGAS ( Another step backward , her desperation rising , a kind of last stand to bolster herself . He finally has her cornered ) You do n't know me. p. 82 SERAFIN I quiver to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamer . That is only one facet of my character . SERAFIN You are a glorious prism that dazzles me with all its facets . MANUELA VARGAS No . Listen . SERAFIN I listen but I hear only the pounding of one voice . MANUELA VARGAS ( She eludes him for a moment and rushes across the room . Desperately ) I am a wife . SERAFIN You 've mentioned that . That 's not an argument , it 's a condition . MANUELA VARGAS I have kept my marriage going . That is an act of will . Less exciting perhaps than scuttling ships on the high seas , but requiring a steadiness and a tenacity of its own . SERAFIN But , Manuela , all this steadiness and tenacity must require strenuous effort . I want to make life easier for you . I want to substitute adventure and experience . Oh , Manuela , come with me , escape with me . MANUELA VARGAS With a man I hardly know ? SERAFIN I hardly know you either . We 'll have the excitement of discovery . ( Dreaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MANUELA VARGAS If it 's heaven you want , you 'll get there quicker if you stay here . SERAFIN I want you to share my life . We 'll begin by touring these enchanted islands  --  pitching our show in those little towns drowsing away in the valleys . MANUELA VARGAS And I 'll be queen of the gypsies , I suppose ! SERAFIN Yes , and after a year or so of sensational obscurity  --  we shall make our debut in Madrid . MANUELA VARGAS You mean you 'll make your debut in Madrid . What will I be doing ? Mending your socks ? My dear friend , I am not the sort of person who can just step out of the house and start on a world tour without a hat . SERAFIN Take a hat . MANUELA VARGAS Before even the slightest journey , even an imaginative one , I have to pack carefully . SERAFIN We would have a glorious life , Manuela . Already we have missed so many springs , so many summers . Shall we miss the rest ? MANUELA VARGAS I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all , it 's a mere geographical accident that separated us. p. 84 MANUELA VARGAS It separates so many people . SERAFIN ( Pressing on ) We might have grown up together . MANUELA VARGAS Not for long . You would have run away to some other Manuela separated from you by geography . SERAFIN ( Coming closer ) I can not believe destiny would be so perverse  --  to give me the vision and then to snatch it away . MANUELA VARGAS ( Realistically ) Destiny is often perverse . It is even malicious . You live by your wits . I am a housewife . I love routine . I could n't possibly live as you do . SERAFIN Can it be , Manuela , that you want me to settle down ? Very well . MANUELA VARGAS I ca n't imagine you settled down . Keep to the life you really love . We 're not for each other . SERAFIN The lonely road again  --  the canopy of stars . Not tonight , Manuela . This canopy  --  ( Grabbing MANUELA 'S hands and holding her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VARGAS ( Struggling ) Let me go ! p. 85 SERAFIN Never while I live MANUELA VARGAS I warn you  --  if you destroy what I have built up I shall despise you  --  I shall hate you . SERAFIN What you have built up is a lie . I must do violence to it because you have n't the strength to abandon it by yourself . MANUELA VARGAS What do you know of my strength ? How dare you make these large assumptions ! How dare you estimate me on an hour 's acquaintance ? What makes you think I 'm so naive ? I do n't really believe you 're Estramudo  --  Let me go ! Let me go ! PEDRO VARGAS ( From off stage . He has tried the door and found it locked ) Manuela , let me in  --  let me in , I say  --  it 's Pedro . MANUELA VARGAS My husband ! SERAFIN Good ! Let 's have this out once and for all . ( He strides to the door , unlocks it and admits PEDRO . Then returns to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . PEDRO stands , watching them ) I 'm prepared , even if you are not , to face the facts of your life . My imaginings are precise and practical , yours are nebulous . MANUELA VARGAS Mine have not led me to violence and crime . ( They face each other . There is now a blazing antagonism between them. ) p. 86 SERAFIN You and I have far to go , dear madame , before we understand each other . MANUELA VARGAS However far we went we should never meet . We are those parallel lines which , the scientists tell us , thoug they reach into infinity , still may never meet . SERAFIN I refuse to submit our relationship to a law of physics . MANUELA VARGAS That will not alter the law . SERAFIN They shall curve like light , these parallel lines , till we converge . ( PEDRO stands there , puffing , his eyes bulging , looking at his wife backed against the bed by the importunate SERAFIN . Neither moves a muscle  --  though they both know he is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PEDRO VARGAS ( Can stand no more ) Do you two realize that I am in the room ! ( PEDRO feels a mixture of anger and fear . SERAFIN : How much has he told MANUELA ? Does she already know ? At the same time his jealousy roils him . He wants to kill them both . ) MANUELA VARGAS Pedro , this man is not here by my invitation . I beg you to believe that . PEDRO VARGAS The guard at the door did not see him pass . You must have slipped him by . p. 87 SERAFIN ( Bearing down on him ) For me walls are porous . You should know that if anybody does , ( PEDRO sweats . ) PEDRO VARGAS I ought to kill you both . SERAFIN You 'd miss us ! MANUELA VARGAS Pedro , husband , this man annoys me . Put him out . SERAFIN Yes , put me out , Pedro ! PEDRO VARGAS ( Unable to bear it longer  --  to MANUELA ) What has he told you ? What has he said to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth ! PEDRO VARGAS The truth ? What truth ? ( He wipes his streaming forehead . ) SERAFIN Is it warm ? You are sweating . PEDRO VARGAS ( Desperate to know ) What has he said to you ? MANUELA VARGAS He is full of tall tales intended to impress me with his grandeur . They do not impress me . They weary me . PEDRO VARGAS What 's he told you ? MANUELA VARGAS That I may not tell you . p. 88 SERAFIN ( Easily ) Everyone in the village knows it by now . Why should n't he ? PEDRO VARGAS ( To protect himself in case ) Whatever he 's told you is a lie  --  I tell you that , Manuela  --  a gross lie . SERAFIN This is not a lie and he of all men knows it . MANUELA VARGAS Why he of all men ? PEDRO VARGAS ( Sure now SERAFIN has revealed his identity ) It 's not true . He 's a cheating mountebank  --  I 'll have him run out of town . ( In his agitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick it up but SERAFIN 'S voice is so searing that he neglects to do it . ) SERAFIN Is it a lie that I am Estramudo the Pirate ? You dropped your rabbit 's foot . I , Estramudo , as you , my sometime captor  --  well know me . PEDRO VARGAS What ? MANUELA VARGAS ( Her eyes lighting ) He your captor ? SERAFIN Even he . MANUELA VARGAS ( Appealing to PEDRO ) Pedro , what 's he saying ? p. 89 PEDRO VARGAS ( Sweating profusely ) I do n't know what he 's talking about . SERAFIN ( Advances on him menacingly ) Jog your brain , Pedro . Jog your brain . And please to remember that Estramudo has decimated cities merely because he disliked the food in the leading restaurant . Neither your rabbit 's foot nor your misplaced relationship to this lady will give you sanctuary . Do not presume too far . Do not call Estramudo a liar ! PEDRO VARGAS ( Completely taken aback . Runs behind MANUELA as if for protection ) You  --  you  --  what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be frightened , Pedro . No matter what he says I do n't believe him . He brags . SERAFIN But your husband knows that I speak the truth . MANUELA VARGAS Nonsense , how would he know ? SERAFIN But , dear Manuela , it 's really one of the ironies of history . MANUELA VARGAS Is it really ? SERAFIN That Pedro there  --  bristling with amulets and barricaded by rabbits ' feet  --  should be the one man alive who nearly did me in . The one man alive ! p. 90 PEDRO VARGAS What ! MANUELA VARGAS Pedro ! SERAFIN He captured me ! The only man who ever succeeded in that  --  he captured me ! MANUELA VARGAS Pedro ! SERAFIN Come back , Pedro . Tell her . Reconstruct the scene  --  you know , the burning deck of the Excelsior . He was returning from a business trip to Algiers . I attacked his ship  --  purely routine job  --  everything was going with monotonous smoothness when this Pedro  --  this very Pedro MANUELA VARGAS Well , what happened ? What did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was much slimmer in those days , I must say . MANUELA VARGAS ( To PEDRO ) He does know you then ? PEDRO VARGAS We met . MANUELA VARGAS You met ! SERAFIN We certainly met . And he was n't very polite about it either . He sneaked around me and manacled me from the rear . MANUELA VARGAS ( Astonished ) Pedro did ! p. 91 SERAFIN Pedro did . What was that voice , Pedro ? That mysterious voice that frightened me so ? What was that voice ? PEDRO VARGAS No , no . SERAFIN Am I or am I not Estramudo the Pirate ? Mene mene PEDRO VARGAS ( Very cunning , begins to see a way out for himself ) Yes , he is Estramudo the Pirate . SERAFIN All your doubts vanished , madame ? MANUELA VARGAS ( Gazing at PEDRO with admiration ) Yes , they are vanished . SERAFIN No more skepticism ? MANUELA VARGAS ( Still loking at PEDRO ) No . Pedro ! You captured him ! PEDRO VARGAS ( Gasping and wiping his forehead ) Yes . MANUELA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you tell me ? PEDRO VARGAS ( Shuffling around ) I do n't know  --  I MANUELA VARGAS But why ? Darling . Why ? PEDRO VARGAS It did n't seem worth mentioning . p. 92 MANUELA VARGAS It did n't seem worth mentioning ! SERAFIN ( Very annoyed ) Manuela , you seem to miss the point . MANUELA VARGAS And what is the point ? SERAFIN The point is not that your husband , by the merest fluke interrupted my operations , but that I am Estramudo and that I escaped and that my exploits ever since have been on a grander scale than ever . MANUELA VARGAS On the contrary . SERAFIN On the contrary , what ? MANUELA VARGAS The point is that Pedro , unaided , captured you and never even mentioned it . The heroism of it  --  the modesty of it ! SERAFIN Well , what do you want , a hero or a shrinking violet ? I wish you 'd make up your mind which . MANUELA VARGAS Both  --  and it appears my husband is both . ( To ESTRAMUDO ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reality  --  you have . I see them now  --  I see them in Pedro . SERAFIN You have a microscopic eye ! MANUELA VARGAS Did you hear what he just said ? It did n't seem worth mentioning ! And indeed he never mentioned it  --  he never told me . Often when I have reproached him for being stodgy , all he need have said was , " Well , I may be a stick-in-the-mud , but I captured Estramudo . I put Estramudo in irons . " But he never said it . He never breathed it . Dear , magnificent , neglected , heroic Pedro  --  forgive me ! p. 93 PEDRO VARGAS ( Relieved  --  cashing in ; magnanimously ) It 's all right , Manuela ! MANUELA VARGAS ( Clinging to him ) I 'll make it up to you . I promise you , dearest , from now on I shall make it up to you . PEDRO VARGAS ( Modestly ) Forget it ! MANUELA VARGAS Never , I 'll never forget it . ( PEDRO begins to preen a bit ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . ) PEDRO VARGAS As a matter of fact , Manuela , it took a lot of nerve ! MANUELA VARGAS Nerve he calls it ! What it must have taken  --  nerve ! I 'm sure it did . SERAFIN Well , of all the incalculable , irrational women I have ever met , you , Manuela , take the cake . MANUELA VARGAS ( Not taking her eyes from PEDRO ) What did he say , dear ? SERAFIN ( Events have taken a disastrous turn ; at his wits ' end ) What will you do ? Stay here and keep your spirit alive with the opiate of dreams , or will you come with me ? Which shall it be ? p. 94 PEDRO VARGAS How far do you think you 'd get ? SERAFIN Beyond your little vision , my good Pedro . I have engagements on the seven seas . Will you keep them with me ? MANUELA VARGAS I 'm not a marine compass . SERAFIN I warn you if I go now it may be forever . MANUELA VARGAS You transform eternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MANUELA VARGAS I encourage it . SERAFIN I had the illusion that you were the woman who could allay for me the hunger that gnaws at the heart of every man , for he knows not what . That you could bridge for me the chasm between the infinite and the finite . ( Sits on stool and takes off shoes for the return journey ) I see now that it was an illusion . However , I bear you no malice . I hope you will both come to my performance this evening . PEDRO VARGAS Surely you 're not going on with that now . SERAFIN More than ever . My identity is being circulated through the village . As a result we 'll sell out . You do n't expect me to walk out on a sold-out house . It is n't natural . My livelihood may be piracy , but my avocation is art . ( He starts toward the window. ) p. 95 MANUELA VARGAS ( Involuntarily , scared ) Do n't do that again  --  take the stairs . SERAFIN Stairs bore me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balcony outside the curtained French windows and presumably over his special highway . Instinctively , MANUELA runs to the window and watches the crossing . ) MANUELA VARGAS Thank God ! PEDRO VARGAS What for ? ( She stands watching , strained in every nerve . PEDRO is eyeing her like a hawk ) Did he make it ? ( She does n't answer . She ca n't speak . PEDRO resumes , with a kind of vindictive caginess ) Oh , you 're relieved , I see . You seem to have changed sides all of a sudden . Or were you always on his ? MANUELA VARGAS ( Sinks to a chair ) Why are you so bitter ? PEDRO VARGAS Because you 're a wanton . Do you think because I 'm fat I 'm blind ? MANUELA VARGAS ( Looks at him , pleading ) Pedro PEDRO VARGAS This her  --  this Estramudo  --  this lover of your dreams p. 96 MANUELA VARGAS Pedro , I beg you . PEDRO VARGAS ( Slyly ) And yet  --  dashing as he is , I captured him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . And , as you say , I never spoke of it . Kept it to myself . Modest , was n't it ? MANUELA VARGAS I wish you would allow your virtues to be discovered instead of ramming them down my throat ! PEDRO VARGAS ( Same sly manner ) Coincidence , is n't it ? MANUELA VARGAS What ? ( She is frightened by the manifest cruelty in his tone and manner , his air of a cat playing with a mouse . ) PEDRO VARGAS Well , you dream of this man  --  you read books about him  --  and then he appears  --  in the flesh , you might say . He appears  --  quite a coincidence  --  a miracle , you might say . MANUELA VARGAS ( Gets up , unable to bear more . She looks at him . His mood is beyond her , sinister ) I do n't like you in this cat and mouse vein , Pedro . What are you thinking ? PEDRO VARGAS You know , Manuela , I 'm beginning to think  --  now you probably wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not considerate enough  --  as a husband , I mean . p. 97 MANUELA VARGAS Now you really worry me ! PEDRO VARGAS I mean it . For instance , we never go on trips together . You 're always talking about how you like to travel and yet we never do . That 's wrong . That 's very wrong . We shall alter that . I 'm going to take you on a trip . Wherever you 'd like to go  --  within reason . What do you say ? MANUELA VARGAS ( Sits on bed ) This is so sudden , Pedro . ( PEDRO has sidled to the balcony windows , peeps out through the curtains . ) PEDRO VARGAS He 's out there in the square , your lover , putting up his show-tent . Cool , I 'll say that for him  --  cool ! MANUELA VARGAS ( Trying to sound casual , fighting for time ) He 's my lover now , is he ? Lucky for you I have n't quite got your tempo . PEDRO VARGAS Do you deny that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PEDRO VARGAS You do n't deny it ! MANUELA VARGAS I never have denied it . PEDRO VARGAS You love this Estramudo . MANUELA VARGAS This seems to be an obsession of yours . p. 98 PEDRO VARGAS You fool ! You blind , deluded fool ! If you knew ! If you only knew ! The gods themselves are laughing at you . If you knew ! MANUELA VARGAS You keep saying , if I knew  --  if I knew what ? PEDRO VARGAS This Estramudo  --  you let him be your lover . Do n't deny it . ( In a sudden rage he slaps her face ) I know it 's true . MANUELA VARGAS ( Flaring up , to wound him ) I do n't deny it . It is my only pride  --  my only joy . PEDRO VARGAS ( His fists clench , his veins stand out on his forehead ) Estramudo . You love Estramudo ! ( His voice rises shrilly ) Very glamorous  --  in the book . Very romantic  --  in the book . The harem episode . Very entertaining  --  oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know what really happened ? He did n't elope with those nine women . Oh , no ! The Sultan asked him to get rid of them because they were getting on his nerves and Estramudo took them out and drowned them  --  every one . He got paid for it . He did it on commission . This is your Estramudo ! MANUELA VARGAS ( Quietly ) How do you know all this ? p. 99 PEDRO VARGAS The Sultan was a customer of mine  --  that 's how I know it ! I sold him cannonballs . He told me . This is the man you dream about . This is the man you idealize . MANUELA VARGAS I do n't believe it . I do n't believe he could do such things . PEDRO VARGAS He could and he has . And more  --  truly unbelievable things  --  nameless things . If you knew  --  if you imagined  --  you would n't adore him quite so much , this Estramudo ! MANUELA VARGAS If all you say is true , then he 's not  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's admitted it , has n't he ? He 's said so , has n't he ? I captured him , did n't I ? MANUELA VARGAS ( Beginning to be overcome by the growing incongruities ) I do n't know , Pedro . This is all very strange . PEDRO VARGAS I 'll prove to you that he is Estramudo . I 'll prove it . MANUELA VARGAS How ? PEDRO VARGAS You heard him say I manacled him . How do you think he got away after that ? I am a firm believer , you know , in the profit system . I made a bargain with him . I made him turn over to me the loot he 'd gathered in twenty years of successful practice . That was my price for letting him off . p. 100 MANUELA VARGAS You still have this loot ? PEDRO VARGAS Part of it . MANUELA VARGAS Oh  --  gave most of it to charity , I suppose ? PEDRO VARGAS ( Piously ) You know I do many good works . MANUELA VARGAS ( Feels herself on the trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PEDRO VARGAS Hidden beneath the floor of the barn at our summer place I have some of the choicest pieces . They 'd make your mouth water . MANUELA VARGAS ( Half to herself ) Fantastic . PEDRO VARGAS ( Sits beside her on the bed ) Fantastic indeed . Buried there I have the diamond necklace of Marie Antoinette , the emerald and ruby stomacher of the Great Catherine MANUELA VARGAS What are you going to do with that ? You ca n't wear it , can you ? PEDRO VARGAS It 's a nice thing to have . MANUELA VARGAS You have these things beneath the floor of our barn ? PEDRO VARGAS ( Not wanting to be too specific ) Oh , well , some of them . Do you believe it now  --  that he is Estramudo ? ( He gets up , starts for the balcony again ) Well , in any case he has admitted it . For that alone he will hang . p. 101 MANUELA VARGAS ( Rises ) Pedro , I 'm willing to promise never to see him again . PEDRO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I promise you that  --  at least once . A very imposing occasion . ( He suddenly bursts into an uncontrollable laugh . MANUELA looks at him , studies him . She is seized with a cold fear . His mirth frightens her . ) MANUELA VARGAS ( Finally ) You find things funny ? PEDRO VARGAS Very . MANUELA VARGAS Would it be too much to ask you to share the joke with me ? PEDRO VARGAS You would n't enjoy it . No , you would n't . ( His laughter simmers down , but not his gaiety . He executes a dance step . ) MANUELA VARGAS You are so happy you dance ! PEDRO VARGAS ( Stops the step ) Oh , no ! MANUELA VARGAS Feeling awfully well , are n't you ? PEDRO VARGAS Not bad . MANUELA VARGAS Why are you in such good spirits ? PEDRO VARGAS ( Canny and secretive again ) I 'm not particularly . ( He sings. ) p. 102 MANUELA VARGAS You sing , you dance . PEDRO VARGAS ( Same voice ) That 's odd ! MANUELA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you rarely dance . PEDRO VARGAS Quite true . Well , I must be off . MANUELA VARGAS Where are you going ? PEDRO VARGAS ( Casually ) To the Capitol . MANUELA VARGAS The Capitol ! Why ? PEDRO VARGAS A little business at the Capitol . MANUELA VARGAS Your business at the Capitol would not by any chance include a visit to the Viceroy , would it , Pedro ? PEDRO VARGAS How keen you are , my dear ! How intuitive ! I may look in on the Viceroy . I may . ( Looks out the window ) Think of it , Manuela . To see your lover mixed up in all that tomfoolery out there you would n't think there was a price on his head . And what a price  --  hundred thousand pesos . Round sum  --  global ! MANUELA VARGAS Please do n't do this , Pedro . In all the years I 've been your wife I 've never begged anything of you . I beg you now  --  do n't inform on him . Look , I 'm prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised never to see him again . I 'll devote myself to you . p. 103 PEDRO VARGAS But your devotion is my right . You promised it at the altar . So you see I 'll have it anyway ! MANUELA VARGAS What makes you so sure ? PEDRO VARGAS It is your eccentricity to be honest . MANUELA VARGAS To you honesty is merely a weakness to be exploited . PEDRO VARGAS Something in what you say . Well , good-bye , my dear . Oh  --  first a slight precaution : to cut your friend 's arterial highway . ( He takes out knife . goes to balcony . He disappears on balcony with knife . MANUELA notices PEDRO 'S rabbit 's foot , picks it up , finds it contains a charm , takes it out . She looks at the charm , reads the inscription , exclaims , replaces charm , walks to bed and sits clutching rabbit 's foot . ) MANUELA VARGAS Pedro ! PEDRO VARGAS ( From balcony off stage ) Well , there 'll be no more rope walking ! Put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the balcony ) I shall take a box . MANUELA VARGAS ( Handing him the rabbit 's foot ) Your rabbit 's foot . PEDRO VARGAS ( Startled , frightened ) Where did you get that ? p. 104 MANUELA VARGAS You dropped it . PEDRO VARGAS ( Grabs it , pretends to be casual ) Would have been bad luck to go to the Capitol without it . Well , good-bye . ( SERAFIN comes in through the door , trembling with anger and carrying a rope . ) SERAFIN ( At white heat  --  to PEDRO ) How dare you ! MANUELA VARGAS I thought stairs bored you . SERAFIN ( His eyes fixed on PEDRO ) How dare you cut that rope ! MANUELA VARGAS It 's his house . SERAFIN ( Without looking at her ) It 's my rope . I had my whole show hung on it and it nearly fell into the square . You gave me a license , did n't you ? How dare you sabotage my performance ? MANUELA VARGAS It 's not your performance , it 's your approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have shown where your sympathies lie , madame . That episode is over . ( Goes out on balcony to fix the rope . ) PEDRO VARGAS Do n't start that all over again . I 'm off to the Capitol . p. 105 SERAFIN ( Coming back in from balcony ) The Capitol ! Oh , are you ? Will you do an errand for me there ? Will you see the local manager for me and book our next engagement ? PEDRO VARGAS I 'll be glad to . I 'll get you a definite engagement ! SERAFIN You 're very kind . After the performance I hope I 'll be in a position to buy you a drink . MANUELA VARGAS ( Sits . Probing , to SERAFIN ) If you 're the great Estramudo , why are you so poor ? SERAFIN It 's my expensive Robin Hood reputation . I give everything to charity . MANUELA VARGAS You too ! Really , I hardly know which is which . SERAFIN ( Puts an arm around PEDRO 'S shoulder ) We have so much in common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not you . ( To PEDRO ) It will be so much fun talking over old times . PEDRO VARGAS We 've got nothing to talk about . SERAFIN Oh , yes we have  --  the burning deck of the Excelsior p. 106 MANUELA VARGAS ( Still questioning ) When you gave him the Great Catherine 's stomacher ? SERAFIN I beg your pardon ? MANUELA VARGAS You gave him Catherine 's stomacher , did n't you ? SERAFIN I never met the lady , but if she had presented me with her stomacher , I should n't have given it to Pedro . I 'd have put it in my memory book . I 'd have saved it for you . MANUELA VARGAS Thank you so much . PEDRO VARGAS Well , I 've got to be off . Good-bye . SERAFIN ( With a bow to MANUELA ) Good-bye again , madame . Our relation is a perpetual farewell . PEDRO VARGAS ( Very expansive . To SERAFIN ) Oh , you do n't have to go . SERAFIN ( Amazed ) Really ? PEDRO VARGAS Not at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home . SERAFIN If you 're so hospitable , why did you cut the rope ? PEDRO VARGAS Did n't want you to come in that way . Conspicuous . Neighbors gossip . As long as you come in respectably , through the front door , you 're more than welcome . Good-bye , my dear one . p. 107 MANUELA VARGAS Do n't go , Pedro ! I warn you . PEDRO VARGAS Sorry , my dear . ( To SERAFIN ) Farewell  --  Prince of Pirates . ( He goes . ) SERAFIN ( Looks after him  --  hands on hips ) Irresistible , is n't he ? Well , how do you account for this sudden cataract of courtesy ? MANUELA VARGAS You fool ! Do n't you see he 's gone to the viceroy to inform on you ? He 's using me as a decoy to keep you here . SERAFIN So that 's his game , is it ? Well , what difference how long I live if only in the time I have left I know you love me . If only I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say it . Say you love me . MANUELA VARGAS Oh , I do not deny I am attracted by you . I do not deny this stirring of love I feel for you . SERAFIN Then I have not wished through the years for an answering love for nothing . I knew it when I saw you in the square below . Shall I leave you now , when after all these years I have found you ? MANUELA VARGAS You face death ! SERAFIN My beloved , do we not all ? MANUELA VARGAS While there is yet time , I beg you . p. 108 SERAFIN And if we are parted , is that not another sort of death ? MANUELA VARGAS Our thoughts could wing the seas and touch . SERAFIN For so long I have been without the sight of your face , beyond the sound of your voice . MANUELA VARGAS We could imagine another meeting in some happier future . SERAFIN You do love me then  --  you do feel then what I feel MANUELA VARGAS I want you to be alive . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it covers you too . SERAFIN I long for a more intimate coverlet . MANUELA VARGAS Do n't joke . SERAFIN I 'm not joking . For years I have lived on improvisation . The sight of you has sickened me of those bogus pearls strung on nothing . Emotionally , too , I have been on the dole . Oh , Manuela , up to today I 've thought I lived in freedom . I see now it was loneliness . MANUELA VARGAS Is this eloquence ? Are these words ? SERAFIN What does the voice tell you , the uncontaminated voice that whispers when freed from the bitter odds life jackets on us ? p. 109 MANUELA VARGAS Must I watch you die ? SERAFIN When that remote event occurs , I hope that you will be there . I should hate to outlive you , Manuela . MANUELA VARGAS I 'll do what I can to keep us contemporary  --  ( Suddenly thinking ) Tell me something . SERAFIN My heart 's deepest secret . MANUELA VARGAS Keep that for a minute . Did you bribe Pedro with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MANUELA VARGAS Never mind  --  you 'll have to excuse me  --  I must go now . ( Calling ) Lizarda . SERAFIN ( Enraged ) What are you doing ? I 'm here by your husband 's invitation . You ca n't do this to me ! ( LIZARDA enters . ) MANUELA VARGAS Lizarda , bring me my cloak and order the carriage . I 'm going to our summer place . LIZARDA Yes , mistress . ( She goes out . ) SERAFIN ( Furious ) I am risking my life for you , and you go riding in the country ! p. 110 MANUELA VARGAS I am doing what I can to lessen that risk , do you mind ? SERAFIN I will not have my sacrifice tampered with , do you hear ! When I am on the way to the scaffold for the woman I love , I will not be tripped up , do you hear ! I have done everything I can to jolt you out of this half-life you are living in , and you wo n't budge . You 're immovable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you 're stupid and conventional ! MANUELA VARGAS Are you quite finished ? SERAFIN Yes , I 'm finished . MANUELA VARGAS Now you listen to me . You have the manners of a spoiled brat , and the effrontery of an unbridled egotist . Because I succumbed to your charm in the beginning , do n't think I 'll endure your temperament , because I wo n't ! SERAFIN I 'll never die for you again  --  never ! ( He starts toward the window . ) MANUELA VARGAS And do n't make for that window . You go down those perfectly good stairs . ( Her tone is so imperious that it stops him ; he has met his master ; he turns and starts slowly for the door ) And walk down too  --  do n't use the bannister . ( He goes out like a whipped puppy. ) p. 111 MANUELA VARGAS ( The moment he is gone ) The fool  --  the fool ! ( Crosses to the window ) The romantic fool ! ( LIZARDA enters , carrying MANUELA 'S cloak , she crosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIZARDA ( Sighs ) Oh , mistress . He 's excessive overwhelmin ' . MANUELA VARGAS I 'll try to save him . But if I fail  --  I 'll never forgive him ! ( She goes out. ) @x SCENE : Early evening . SERAFIN 'S show tent is now up , almost filling the stage between the two rows of houses . A miniature , coroneted proscenium , with green and white striped curtains , and in front of it the platform with its row of old-fashioned footlights . From the platform a runway , such as has been used in contemporary musical comedies . This runs forward almost to the actual footlights and the stage audience , when it comes in , sits on either side of it . The porches of MANUELA 'S and ISABELLA 'S houses form boxes . SERAFIN has draped the little iron railings of the porches so that they look quite gala . TRILLO , greatly agitated , is hectically arranging SERAFIN 'S props and costumes . Music comes from the town and from the hills ; the rather weird punctuation of flamenco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable of a stir . TRILLO ( Agitatedly ) Well , Bolo , have you had any results with him ? DON BOLO He wo n't go . Nothin ' on earth can get him to go . TRILLO What 's he doing ? DON BOLO Acceptin ' drinks from the gentry , disregardless of his peril . Tellin ' stories of his piratical experiences . Actin ' as if he was n't practically hung already . p. 113 TRILLO Fate has crept up on us . Listen to that singing . He 's got the whole town singing  --  music for his own hanging . DON BOLO I 've half a mind to run away before the show . I advise you to get a move on too because it could be established you 's a accomplice . What made him twine himself in this perilous complication ? TRILLO ( Significantly ) Sachet la femme . DON BOLO Riskin ' his life for a woman ! Ca n't you do anything with him , Trillo ? He loves you . Ca n't you dissuade him ? TRILLO He disregards me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  get ready the props . The curtain of the future is black , Bolo . DON BOLO I 'm going to make a gi'antic effort . I 'm going to threaten him . I 'll abscond if he do n't get away . If necessary , I 'll resort to kidnapin ' . ( A half-dozen soldiers enter ; black-skinned and black-bearded , with scarlet uniforms and towering , tufted busbies . ) TRILLO The end is nigh ! ( OFFICER enters . ) OFFICER Strict orders from the Viceroy . No member of the troupe is to leave the premises . ( He goes out. ) p. 114 DON BOLO Too late long ago ! ( Goes into tent . LIZARDA appears on MANUELA 'S balcony . She has a note in a sealed envelope in her hand . She whistles to TRILLO . ) TRILLO ( Looking up adoringly at LIZARDA on her balcony ) That you , blissful ? LIZARDA Blissful is just what I 'm not . I 'm overflowin ' with apprehension . TRILLO It is true the night is fraught with peril . LIZARDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly . LIZARDA Then you must fly . TRILLO ( Stoutly ) Where he is , there I is ! LIZARDA My mistress has written a note to your mighty master . The fishnet of the law is noosin ' you . The Viceroy 's comin ' to apprehend your master . TRILLO The Viceroy ! LIZARDA Yes . TRILLO Himself ? LIZARDA Himself . TRILLO That is formidable . That is sure p. 115 LIZARDA I pray you  --  my lady prays you TRILLO Of old I know him . He will not take cover . LIZARDA Then you both incurs the tight courtship of the law . TRILLO ( Stolidly ) We courts it . ( LIZARDA sighs . TRILLO sighs . They look at each other ) Blissful  --  what is your other name ? LIZARDA Lizarda . TRILLO Lizarda ! LIZARDA And yours ? TRILLO Trillo . LIZARDA Trillo . Oh , Trillo ! TRILLO It was a case with me when first I beheld your sweet face , when first I heard your limpid voice  --  it was a case of a instantaneous conflagration ! Whisper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? LIZARDA ( Breathing it out to the night ) I was incinerated ! TRILLO Is it not ironical that on this here night ? LIZARDA On this here beloved night TRILLO That on this here beloved night when we faces consummation we also faces grave peril p. 116 LIZARDA It is most malignant . Your mighty master  --  will he not fly ? TRILLO Sweet cherub , do you not prognosticate ? My master , he too , is struck with the rapture ; he , too , is pierced with the dart . LIZARDA For my lady ? TRILLO For your lady . Never have I known him so all-gone pierced . Through these long years of wear and tear I have observed him , sweet Lizarda , and this is the first time  --  the first time , I promise you , I have seen him clean transfixed . Therefore , lovely mistress , he will not fly . LIZARDA Perhaps this note  --  written in the fair hand of my lady TRILLO Waft it to me , sweet Lizarda , and I will place it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He catches it . ISABELLA appears on her balcony and sees it . ) ISABELLA GALVEZ That note for me ? TRILLO No , Mistress Galvez . ISABELLA GALVEZ If it 's for your master , why not give it to me ? I 'm seeing him later and I 'll deliver it . LIZARDA ( To TRILLO ) No  --  no p. 117 TRILLO ( To LIZARDA ) Never fear . ( To ISABELLA ) I ca n't do that , Mistress Galvez , ' cause this note is pressin ' . ISABELLA GALVEZ I can imagine . What does it say ? TRILLO Madam , it is my good fortune I ca n't read . ( TRILLO goes out . ) ISABELLA GALVEZ ( To LIZARDA ) Lizarda , what 's your mistress doing ? LIZARDA ( Crying ) Oh , Mistress Galvez , she is full of agitation . ISABELLA GALVEZ Really ! How interesting ! What about ? LIZARDA I do n't know , Mistress . ISABELLA GALVEZ Ask her to come out . LIZARDA She asked me not to disturb her , Mistress Galvez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out and talk to me . I 'll cheer her up . ( PEDRO comes in through the square . His clothes are dusty . He has ridden hard . He sees ISABELLA talking to LIZARDA . ) PEDRO VARGAS Lizarda ! Have I not forbidden you to talk to her ? p. 118 LIZARDA ( Frightened ) Oh , Master . ( PEDRO turns to ISABELLA . ) PEDRO VARGAS ( To ISABELLA ) One of these days I 'll have you flogged publicly . ISABELLA GALVEZ What fun for you ! PEDRO VARGAS ( To LIZARDA ) What 's your mistress doing ? LIZARDA She 's lying down , Master . PEDRO VARGAS Tell her to get up . Tell her to get up and get dressed . Tell her she must look her best tonight . We 're going to the show ! LIZARDA Yes , Master . PEDRO VARGAS At once  --  do you hear ? LIZARDA Yes , Master . PEDRO VARGAS Be quick about it . LIZARDA I 'll tell her , Master . ( She goes inside . ) ISABELLA GALVEZ Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PEDRO VARGAS ( Expansive ) Oh , I adore him . I 'm very grateful to him ! ISABELLA GALVEZ Generous husband ! p. 119 PEDRO VARGAS Why not ? Live and let live . ISABELLA GALVEZ ( Trying to wound him ) He gets about , does n't he ? PEDRO VARGAS He certainly gets about . ISABELLA GALVEZ Why do n't you learn to walk the rope , Pedro ? PEDRO VARGAS Maybe I will ! ISABELLA GALVEZ What are you so cheerful about anyway ? ( A drum roll is heard and a bugle ) What 's that ? PEDRO VARGAS ( In ecstasy ) The bugle-call of the Viceroy 's guard ! ISABELLA GALVEZ Both of them ? PEDRO VARGAS He 's here  --  the Viceroy 's here . ISABELLA GALVEZ Will he be at the performance ? PEDRO VARGAS As my guest . ISABELLA GALVEZ Introduce me to him . If things go right I 'll move to the Capitol . PEDRO VARGAS You 're far too ambitious , Madame Galvez . ISABELLA GALVEZ ( Snapping back ) No more ambitious than your wife . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be a world tour ! ( She disappears inside. ) p. 120 PEDRO VARGAS ( To himself , gloating ) They 're here  --  they 're here ! ( He executes a little dance step . As he reaches his doorstep a file of soldiers marches in . The soldiers take their places in double rank , facing the showbooth . PEDRO stands a minute , staring at them . His revenge is sweet ) My cup is full to running over ! Let it run  --  Let it spill ! ( He goes inside . The stage is deserted for a moment . TRILLO comes back . SERAFIN enters through the square . ) TRILLO Oh , Captain , I 'm sure glad you got here ! SERAFIN ( With a look at the soldiers ) If the army wants to see the show , let them in for half price . TRILLO I have a note for you , Captain , from your lady . ( SERAFIN takes the note , reads it , puts it in his pocket ) Oh , Captain , I 'm scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumph , scared ? On the eve of recognition , scared ? TRILLO Yes , Captain , plain scared . SERAFIN You did n't get out the props I wanted . Where 's the revolving mirror ? TRILLO ( Suspicious ) What do you want with that ? p. 121 SERAFIN Never mind . Where is it ? TRILLO Here it is . ( TRILLO gets long box , gives it to SERAFIN . ) SERAFIN Is it wound ? Is it oiled ? Is it true ? TRILLO Yes , Captain , it 's everything . ( Perturbed ) I hope you 're not going to use that tonight , Captain . There 's enough against us now . SERAFIN ( Over-riding him ) And I want the crystal and the moonstone and the ebony funnel . TRILLO ( Very apprehensive ) What are you up to , Captain ? SERAFIN ( Casually ) You will discover . TRILLO Captain , please do n't employ these devices tonight . SERAFIN Why not ? TRILLO The man you persuaded to concentrate on that mirror in Valencia ai n't waked up yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misfortune to practice on a victim of chronic sleeping-sickness . TRILLO I pray you , Captain , let us fly while there is yet time . p. 122 SERAFIN There is no time . Our backs are to the wall . Ingenuity , not flight , will save us . TRILLO But the Viceroy 's coming . ( SERAFIN sits on the stool and starts to make up before a little mirror . ) SERAFIN We shall do our best to entertain him . I have played before the King of Spain . I have appeared before the Khedive of Egypt . Do you expect me to be cowed by the presence of a provincial governor ? TRILLO He ai n't comin ' because he 's stage-struck . SERAFIN Why then ? TRILLO Because it 's broached his ears you 're Estramudo and he wants the high honor to arrest you personal . SERAFIN We shall cope with the Viceroy . TRILLO What benefit from your copin ' if you swing for it ? ( Suddenly DON BOLO , wide-eyed with terror , sticks his head through the flaps of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terrified , pleads ) Please , Captain , let 's amble . SERAFIN ( At his most commanding ) Bolo , go out there . Greet the Viceroy in my behalf . Tell him we shall be pleased to receive him here . Do as I tell you , Bolo. p. 123 TRILLO ( As he goes out with BOLO ) We , who is about to die , salutes you . ( Music swells ; soldiers enter and the VICEROY . He is an old man but erect and clear-skinned ; he is shrewd , sardonic and distinguished . SERAFIN advances to him , drops on one knee before him . ) SERAFIN I am honored , Excellency , that you have come this distance to see our little entertainment . I trust that our poor talents will yield not too scanty a reward for the ardors of your journey . We shall do our best . VICEROY ( Amused at SERAFIN 'S assumption that he has come to see the show ) Do you imagine that my visit to you is esthetic ? SERAFIN Our entertainment is not highbrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a little science . VICEROY Science also ? SERAFIN I am a pupil of the great Mesmer . I have delved into the mysteries of animal magnetism . I perform experiments which may divert you . VICEROY You make me regret , alas , that I shall have to miss your entertainment . SERAFIN ( Innocent ) Miss it , Excellency ? p. 124 VICEROY Unfortunately , I am afraid that you will have to miss it also . It is my unpleasant duty to arrest you . SERAFIN On what ground , Excellency ? VICEROY For the moment it suits you to be an impresario . But it comes to my ears that you have an avocation somewhat more destructive . SERAFIN Will you arrest me , Excellency , on a rumor ? VICEROY I arrest you on rumor . We shall try you on evidence . ( He nods to his men . ) SERAFIN ( Protesting ) Excellency ! ( Two LIEUTENANTS step forward and handcuff SERAFIN and then step back . ) VICEROY I am very sorry to have to do this . Our county jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . As it happens , I knew Mesmer . His science fascinates me also . However , I hope you will not attempt to hypnotize the jailers . We shall have to put on guards who are complete extroverts . Good evening . ( The VICEROY turns to go . SERAFIN makes another circling movement . The two LIEUTENANTS go up the steps and stand in front of the two upstage exits left and right . ) SERAFIN One word , Excellency. p. 125 VICEROY ( Turns ) Well ? SERAFIN I pray you , let me give this performance tonight VICEROY What a passion for exhibitionism ! SERAFIN Let me give this show , then do with me what you will . VICEROY You are a clever man . You must see that the procedure would be irregular . SERAFIN Put your men in the wings , but let me give the show . VICEROY If you escaped , I should have to consider myself a fool . I do not care to undervalue myself . SERAFIN It is not to escape . What chance to escape  --  with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why ? Why ? SERAFIN You are an imaginative man . You are a subtle man VICEROY I can not , in all honesty , contradict you . Still  --  there is a noose about your neck . Why ? SERAFIN To answer that question  --  I shall have to give you a glimpse into my personal life . Do you mind ? VICEROY ( Ironic , but interested ) The vista fascinates me ! p. 126 SERAFIN I am in love , Excellency . VICEROY You have leisure for that also ? What a crowded life ! SERAFIN Love insinuates itself into the busiest of careers . Excellency , read this note . ( He hands him MANUELA 'S note . The VICEROY takes it , unfolds it and reads it , while SERAFIN hangs on him ) What do you think , Excellency ? Is it encouraging ? What is your opinion ? VICEROY It is  --  enigmatic . SERAFIN ( Pouncing on the interpretation ) That 's just it , Excellency ! How clever of you to have divined from that brief note her essential quality . Enigmatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer . VICEROY ( Rather flattered ) She is married ? SERAFIN Oh , very . VICEROY They always are ! SERAFIN Excellency , I know it is not your function to give advice to the lovelorn , but you are humane , you are human . Tell me what to do ? VICEROY What have you to offer this lady ? SERAFIN The future . p. 127 VICEROY It threatens to be brief ! SERAFIN What of that ? Who said  --  " Life gives us but moments , and for those moments we give our lives " ? VICEROY I 'm afraid I do n't understand that sort of thing . SERAFIN Were you never in love , Excellency ? VICEROY ( Trying to remember ) I suppose I must have been . Let me see SERAFIN Have you never wanted to die for a woman ? VICEROY No ! Yes  --  once  --  yes . SERAFIN ( In triumph ) Ah ! VICEROY Fortunately , I did not succeed . SERAFIN I hope I fail also . ( He is circling about the VICEROY . ) VICEROY Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SERAFIN These are dizzy heights . I am on the brink of love . I am on the brink of death . VICEROY One thing I do not understand . If I let you give this show  --  what good will it do you ? SERAFIN I want to hear her say it once . p. 128 VICEROY What ? SERAFIN I want to hear her say , " I love you . " VICEROY And if she does say it , will it not make this world more difficult to leave ? SERAFIN On the contrary it will make the journey to the other bearable . VICEROY ( Laughs ) Incomprehensible . ( Taps the note which he still has ) But the writer of this note does not wear her heart on her sleeve . How will you make her say she loves you ? SERAFIN I do n't know , Excellency . VICEROY You do n't know ! SERAFIN I live by improvisation . VICEROY I think you have a pretty shrewd idea . I 'm curious , I must confess . Still  --  I will be frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn that I have a strong suspicon that you are not really Estramudo at all ? SERAFIN Excellency , you must believe that ! VICEROY However , if you insist you are Estramudo , I must take you at your word . But it is a dangerous game you are playing , my boy  --  more dangerous than you realize . You are a lover  --  in a world of cynics . You present me , for instance , with an irresistible temptation . It is always helpful politically , you know , to capture an important criminal . p. 129 SERAFIN I shall be only too happy , Excellency , to further your career . VICEROY ( Laughs ) Now what does one do with a man like you ? SERAFIN Put me in your memoirs . VICEROY I shall . With a chapter heading , " Help from an Unexpected Quarter . " Well , you may give your show . SERAFIN Excellency ! VICEROY When do you start ? SERAFIN Whenever you 're in the mood . VICEROY With your passion for acting , I wonder you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Excellency . Piracy is so much easier . Will you give us a few moments to make our preparations ? VICEROY Very well . ( He hands the note to SERAFIN who reaches up and takes it with a free hand . The VICEROY turns to go , and suddenly wheels back as he realizes that SERAFIN has somehow gotten rid of the handcuffs ) Did I see correctly ? SERAFIN ( Handing the handcuffs back to the VICEROY ) I 'm afraid you did . I could have returned these earlier but I did n't want you to feel insecure . p. 130 VICEROY ( Grimly ) My men will remain ! SERAFIN Gladly . VICEROY ( As he hands the handcuffs to the LIEUTENANT ) Do n't take your eyes off him ! ( To SERAFIN ) Tell me , did you really study with Mesmer or are you a congenital liar ? Foolish question , do n't bother to answer . ( To guards ) Stand back , men , give the impresario a little room . ( To SERAFIN ) There 's something rather perverse about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decadence . Rather agreeable . ( He rings the bell of PEDRO 'S house ) Good luck tonight . I do wish I could have permitted you to remain . You might have had quite a run here  --  I shall miss you . SERAFIN It will be a pleasure to be executed by a man of such charm ! ( They both bow . The VICEROY goes into PEDRO 'S house ) Bolo , have the orchestra stand by . DON BOLO ( To boys offstage ) Orchestra , stand by . ( TRILLO comes in . ) TRILLO ( On the verge of tears ) Oh , Captain ! p. 131 SERAFIN Well , Trillo , this will be a unique performance . Estramudo 's last appearance . We ought to double the prices . Announce it , Trillo . Double prices ! TRILLO ( Drying a tear ) You are doubtless the most avaricious corpse I have ever wept to see . What good 's money once you is gone ? SERAFIN I have no inferiority complex , Trillo , but I am under no illusion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it wo n't . Bolo , call beginners . Tell the boys to play up . DON BOLO ( Obeying ) Beginners  --  play up , boys . ( LIZARDA comes in . ) LIZARDA ( Very flurried ) If you please , sir , the Governor says you better start . ( TRILLO goes toward her as she exits ; SERAFIN intervenes . ) SERAFIN No , Trillo , no . Do not let your personal life interfere with your art ! ( Puts his arms around TRILLO and BOLO ) I may be snatched away during the performance . If you do n't see me again keep up the tradition of the troupe . ( The two begin to weep ) I bequeath to you the props and my professional secrets . Guard them ! Guard them ! Trillo , you may have my costumes and my earrings . Bolo , you may have the rabbit  --  but no matter how hard pressed , do n't eat it . Courage ! Think of it ! Tonight there will be a crowd . For the first time in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , we will be outnumbered by the audience . What a sensation ! Overture ! ( SERAFIN exits through the curtains of the show tent . Fanfare and music . People , white and colored , but mainly colored , dressed in their fantastic , gala best , begin to drift in . Offstage we hear ESTABAN 'S spiel to the incoming audience. ) p. 132 ESTABAN The only chance , Ladies and Gentlemen , the only chance to see him in person  --  to see him in the flesh . He makes the ladies dream and their husbands tremble . Mesmer 's favorite pupil . Reads the past , the present and the future . Foretold the Battle of Waterloo and the Hundred Days . Foretold all the childbirths of the Empress of Austria . He knows in advance  --  he knows in advance . Get in line . Do n't crowd  --  get in line . ( The VICEROY 'S two lieutenants come in and stroll over to ISABELLA 'S house as ISABELLA comes out . The lieutenants kiss her hand and chat with her . INES , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LIZARDA comes out . TRILLO moves toward her , watches her . ) ISABELLA GALVEZ ( Looking across  --  to the LIEUTENANTS ) That 's the Viceroy , is n't it ? I 've been dying to meet him . Could you manage an introduction ? INES ( As she shows the VICEROY his chair ) Shall we sit here , Excellency ? Everybody can see us from here . High visibility . ( She giggles . The VICEROY smiles . One of the LIEUTENANTS crosses to the VICEROY , whispers in his ear . The VICEROY rises , bows to INES and follows the LIEUTENANT across the stage to ISABELLA. ) p. 133 OFFICER ( Introducing VICEROY to ISABELLA ) May I have the honor , Excellency , to present Donna Galvez ? ( The VICEROY bows . ) ISABELLA GALVEZ Greetings . You so seldom visit our village . VICEROY That is my loss , Seora Galvez . ISABELLA GALVEZ I come often to the Capitol and gaze at Government House from outside . VICEROY Ah , we shall soon remedy that . ISABELLA GALVEZ ( In ecstasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and takes possession of the VICEROY , dragging him away . ) INES ( Firmly to VICEROY ) Do n't carry democracy too far , Excellency , stay with me . ISABELLA GALVEZ ( Bridling ) Some people think they 're better than anybody else . INES Some people are right ! VICEROY ( To ISABELLA , soothing her ) Au revoir , Seora Galvez . ( He bows and starts back across the stage with INES . MANUELA comes in and stands in the " box " surveying the scene. ) p. 134 INES ( To VICEROY ) Did you know that I was once engaged to a Duc ? His family objected . The Duc was broken-hearted and so was I  --  for two weeks . ISABELLA GALVEZ ( To the LIEUTENANTS , bitterly , staring at INES ) She thinks she owns the earth . Her husband is a gambler . Mine was an alderman ! ( As INES and the VICEROY turn to go into the box they see MANUELA . ) INES Excellency , does n't my daughter look like me ? Same coloring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gala ! In Madrid I always went to first nights with the Marquis de Verdugo . ESTABAN ( Enters , selling cocoanuts and sugar cane . He circulates through the crowd . ) Cocoanuts  --  full of cool milk  --  soothes the anxious  --  cools the passionate . ( One of the troupe comes out and starts his dance . There is applause when he finishes his number . BOLO comes on and sings a familiar song . The crowd joins in the song . During this number two white girls come in with a colored attendant . As they pass the VICEROY 'S box , they bow to him and hurriedly find places to sit . The stage is quite full by this time . ) INES Why ca n't people come in on time ? ( serafin comes in in full costume , green mantle , stitched with the signs of the Zodiac and a wonderful tufted hat . A murmur through the crowd. ) p. 135 FIRST GIRL Are you scared ? SECOND GIRL I am thrilled and scared too . INES ( To the girls ) Sh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his gloves and rolls them into a bouquet which he hands to MANUELA . Then he makes an omelette in a dish and this omelette turns into a rabbit . When the applause for this transformation has died down , he walks down the runway and addresses the crowd . He is in easy rapport with his audience , friendly , humorous , a bit cynical  --  talking to it in affectionate camaraderie . He is in a pleasant glow , conscious that things have been going pretty well and that the audience is as well disposed toward him as he is to it  --  in short he indulges in that " comedy of insult " of which perhaps he , SERAFIN , was the first practitioner . ) SERAFIN ( To the audience ) And now , Ladies and Gentlemen , honored guest  --  ( He bows to the VICEROY , who returns the bow ) in behalf of my little troupe , these genial virtuosi of the hi-de-ho , may I thank you for your indulgence and appreciation ? I am particularly happy that you are pleased this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance . Not that this is my first farewell performance  --  I am old enough to have given many  --  but this time I think I can rely on our honored guest to make it a genuine farewell . ( He bows ironically to the VICEROY . The VICEROY bows back . MANUELA hangs her head . PEDRO glows with pleasure ) Forgive me for bringing in the personal note  --  but for me as well as for you this is a special occasion . Usually at this time I perform a rope trick  --  but under the circumstances I thought it might be in questionable taste . I did not want to allow a macabre note to enter the proceedings . After all , we are here to entertain you , not to depress you , and so I skip the rope . ( Laughter from the crowd ) Although let me assure you I manipulate this fluid instrument with a dexterity and ingenuity that has beguiled potentates and plebeians the world over . Therefore I come quickly to the more serious side of our entertainment  --  an experiment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me by its proponent  --  taught me by the great Mesmer himself . You know , of course , the principles enunciated by the great Mesmer . You know how he divined the influence exerted by the stars on human beings . How he traced this force first to electricity , and then to magnetism . He began his experiment by stroking diseased bodies with magnets and then discarded the magnets when he became conscious of this healing power within himself . This force , Ladies and Gentlemen , flows through us all  --  in some the current is stronger than in others . When these forces converge , two human beings become as one , the stronger manipulating force drawing out the secrets of the other . Ladies and Gentlemen , there is a new-fangled word to describe this state : Hypnosis ! Hypnosis  --  hypnosis  --  and the power to induce it was taught me by the great Mesmer himself . And now , Ladies and Gentlemen , before your very eyes I shall perform this experiment ! ( At this point , a Gothic curtain comes down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a ghostly moonlight . A hush falls on the crowd ) But in order to do so , I shall need the help of one of you . ( Pause  --  SERAFIN looks around ) When I began these experiments , I called for volunteers . This was not always entirely successful . Control can not be exercised over everyone . I have failed with the recalcitrant , with the confused , with the rebellious , with the evil , with those whose souls are stumpy with greed and envy  --  in short , Ladies and Gentlemen , to perform this experiment ideally , I need a pure person . Are there any pure people here tonight ? ( He smiles ) It 's a lot to ask , I know . Purity is very rare . Very rare . Let me see . ( He looks at the VICEROY ) Our distinguished guest ? Well , it 's too much to expect purity of a politician  --  he would be the last to claim it . ( The VICEROY smiles . He is enjoying himself hugely , SERAFIN Keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found among the sophisticated ( INES winks at him ) I 'm afraid not . Hardly  --  no  --  venerable , but not pure ( He continues the search ) It is almost too much to expect . Ah ! Ladies and Gentlemen , if we were only all of us back in Arcadia , how easy to perform this experiment ! Easy , perhaps , but not interesting . One pure person  --  fortunately I , the manipulator , do not have to be pure . Fortunately , I ( As he sees PEDRO ) Now , if only , instead of innocence , I were seeking corruption , how easy my task would be ( His eyes meet MANUELA 's . He holds them . There is a pause . Finally , in a whisper , these words escape from SERAFIN ) Nymph , in thy orisons , be all my sins remembered . Purity at last  --  purity ! ( From the moment his eyes rest on MANUELA 's the chain of their glance is never broken until the " experiment " is finally over . He walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage toward her box ) Gracious lady  --  that you should be here , at my farewell , makes it a blessing indeed . Gracious lady  --  ( By this time he is very near her . He reaches out his hand to her ) Come  --  come  --  As I , Serafin , ask it  --  my last request  --  my last request Come  --  come ( MANUELA rises , already half in a trance . We do not know exactly whether it is a genuine hypnosis or from her desire to obey the man she loves , his dying request . She rises slowly and reaches out her hand to him . PEDRO tries to intervene. ) p. 136 PEDRO VARGAS Manuela  --  what are you doing ? SERAFIN ( Pays no attention to PEDRO , Keeps his eyes on MANUELA ) Come  --  you know whatever I ask of you  --  whatever power I have is for you  --  is for your happiness  --  for your soul 's salvation and mine . Gracious lady  --  come . ( By this time , MANUELA has risen and , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform BOLO and TRILLO bring out stools and place them for SERAFIN and MANUELA to sit on . ) PEDRO VARGAS ( Protesting violently ) I forbid this ! This is a disgrace , Viceroy . She is my wife ! VICEROY ( Very much interested ) This is not a divorce , Pedro . It is an experiment . SERAFIN ( Very softly , holding MANUELA by his eyes ) Sit , gracious lady pure spirit , rest . ( MANUELA sits , SERAFIN stands before her . He passes his hands over her face . ) PEDRO VARGAS ( Shrieks ) My wife ! SERAFIN ( Taking revolving mirror from TRILLO and holding it in front of MANUELA 's eyes ) Will you please explain to him , Excellency , that this is not passion , it is science . p. 137 VICEROY ( Complying , to PEDRO ) It 's science . PEDRO VARGAS Whatever you call it , I do n't like it . VICEROY You must be more public-spirited . INES He should do that to me . I have so much more to tell ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid of me ? MANUELA VARGAS No , no . SERAFIN ( Softly ) I only want what is best for you  --  you know that . MANUELA VARGAS Yes , I know that . SERAFIN Manuela , if you have in your soul any secret conflict , speak freely to me who am your friend . I have only one wish , Manuela , only one MANUELA VARGAS I , too , have only one wish . SERAFIN And what is that , Manuela ? MANUELA VARGAS I wish , I wish PEDRO VARGAS Black magic ! I wo n't have him practice black magic on my wife ! VICEROY Please , Pedro p. 138 PEDRO VARGAS It 's an outrage ! ISABELLA GALVEZ Do n't let him stop , Excellency . Maybe she 'll tell something vital . VICEROY ( To PEDRO ) This promises to be an amusing experiment . I will not have it spoiled by your bourgeois possessiveness . ( To SERAFIN ) Proceed , Mesmer , with your mesmerism . ( During these interruptions SERAFIN and MANUELA have not moved an inch , nor have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SERAFIN Your wish , Manuela  --  your wish MANUELA VARGAS ( Vaguely ) I 've forgotten . SERAFIN ( Patiently ) Do n't worry  --  there is plenty of time  --  it will come back to you . MANUELA VARGAS No woman was ever in such a dilemma . PEDRO VARGAS ( Blustering ) She 's in no dilemma , she 's very happy . VICEROY Please , Pedro . SERAFIN You speak of a dilemma , Manuela  --  what is it ? p. 139 MANUELA VARGAS No woman was ever in such a dilemma . SERAFIN That is a large statement , Manuela . In most women 's lives dilemmas are frequent . INES That was my life . One dilemma after the other . SERAFIN What is your dilemma , Manuela ? MANUELA VARGAS It 's really laughable . SERAFIN I sha n't laugh . MANUELA VARGAS My dilemma is that I have found him of whom I dream and he is no better than my husband . In fact , he is SERAFIN ( Interrupting ) Who ? MANUELA VARGAS No better . SERAFIN This is a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you mean ? MANUELA VARGAS He is so romantic and reckless  --  in fact , he is quite adolescent . I do n't know what to do with him . SERAFIN Has he made no suggestions ? MANUELA VARGAS Oh , yes , but none that I can accept . You see , I am a wife . SERAFIN It seems to me we 've heard that somewhere before . p. 140 MANUELA VARGAS Men can wander about with stars in their eyes , but women  --  especially when they are in love SERAFIN Yes ? MANUELA VARGAS Women have to think about the future . You see , I am not a Bohemian . SERAFIN Pure soul , pure soul MANUELA VARGAS Romance is all very well for escape , but when you meet a real person whom you could love you do n't need romance , and you 're irritated by recklessness . You want the real man  --  to have him and to hold him  --  you want to take no chances with him . I want him legitimately , if possible , illegitimately if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VARGAS I am not a pure soul . I am an unhappy , love-starved woman . You ca n't be pure when you 're frustrated . INES ( With a giggle ) It 's even hard when you 're not frustrated . PEDRO VARGAS ( He can resist no longer ) Excellency , how much longer are you going to permit this ? VICEROY Indefinitely . SERAFIN Go on , Manuela. p. 141 MANUELA VARGAS If I had the man I love , then I could be pure . I could be pure in my devotion to him . Purity then would be a joy . INES There speaks my daughter . ISABELLA GALVEZ She 's a hussy . ( MANUELA laughs a little . ) SERAFIN Why do you laugh ? MANUELA VARGAS I was rather wicked , I must say . SERAFIN Pure soul , can you be wicked ? MANUELA VARGAS Do n't call me pure soul  --  it irritates me . I was wicked . SERAFIN How ? MANUELA VARGAS I tortured him . SERAFIN Whom ? MANUELA VARGAS My husband . SERAFIN How ? MANUELA VARGAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have no lover ? MANUELA VARGAS Not yet . SERAFIN Pure soul . ISABELLA GALVEZ She 's hovering on the brink . VICEROY ( Drily , to PEDRO ) Congratulations ! p. 142 SERAFIN Manuela , was this a device merely ? MANUELA VARGAS Yes . I wanted to annoy him . SERAFIN Did you succeed ? MANUELA VARGAS Oh , wonderfully . I thought he would burst . In fact , he did . SERAFIN ( With a gesture toward PEDRO ) At the moment , he seems restive  --  but intact . MANUELA VARGAS In his desire to hurt me he lost all control of himself  --  and nearly burst out with the truth . SERAFIN And what was that , Manuela ? MANUELA VARGAS The Sultan with all those wives of his SERAFIN Well ? MANUELA VARGAS He was henpecked ! ( PEDRO gets up , protesting violently . ) PEDRO VARGAS Excellency , this is immoral . I wo n't listen . SERAFIN I am only trying to get at the truth , Excellency . PEDRO VARGAS The truth is immoral . It should n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear about the Sultan ? I am longing to hear about the Sultan . p. 143 PEDRO VARGAS ( Shouts ) Fairy tales ! VICEROY Fairy tales are a form of truth also , Pedro . PEDRO VARGAS I 'm ill . I 've got an aftack coming on . INES Go in and lie down in your hammock , darling . PEDRO VARGAS I think I will . INES Sweet dreams . ( PEDRO goes into his house . SERAFIN motions TRILLO and BOLO to follow him . They go out after PEDRO . ) VICEROY ( Settling himself comfortably , to SERAFIN ) Now we can go comfortably into the domestic difficulties of the Sultan . SERAFIN Manuela , what has the Sultan to do with you and your husband ? MANUELA VARGAS Do n't you see ? My husband disposed of them . SERAFIN Disposed of whom ? MANUELA VARGAS The Sultan 's nine wives . He got rid of them . Took them off and drowned them like so many kittens . He got paid by the head . Just like Pedro . If someone offered him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say your husband did that  --  your husband  --  are you sure ? p. 144 MANUELA VARGAS Oh , yes , Estramudo , I am sure . Why do I call you Estramudo ? SERAFIN Why not , Manuela ? MANUELA VARGAS Because you are not . SERAFIN How do you know ? MANUELA VARGAS Because you only said you were to interest me . ( Sensation among the audience . The VICEROY leans forward . MANUELA rather begins to prattle ) You did n't have to  --  you interested me anyway . SERAFIN Really  --  in what way ? MANUELA VARGAS I do n't know  --  I think it was just the way you circled round me . Everywhere I went , there I came smack up against you . I 'd never been circled like that before . VICEROY ( To SERAFIN ) Can you keep her on the subject , Mesmer ? SERAFIN ( To VICEROY ) I 'll try . ( To MANUELA ) You say I told you I was Estramudo to interest you . And did it interest you ? MANUELA VARGAS Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because of all men alive , Estramudo seemed the farthest removed from my husband . p. 145 SERAFIN You wanted to get away from your husband ? MANUELA VARGAS Oh , yes  --  oh , yes . INES Who does n't ? SERAFIN Why did you want to get away from your husband ? MANUELA VARGAS Because my husband is n't interested in me . If he is , he never shows it . SERAFIN And this causes you unhappiness ? MANUELA VARGAS It bores me . My life is empty . That is why I dreamt of Estramudo . But now I have no one to dream of . SERAFIN Is Estramudo exhausted ? MANUELA VARGAS That 's what 's so sad . You see  --  Estramudo is my husband . ( Sensation  --  the VICEROY leans forward . Crowd gasps . ) SERAFIN Manuela , this is rather startling . You say that your husband , the estimable Pedro MANUELA VARGAS Oh , he 's a terrible fraud . SERAFIN In what way ? MANUELA VARGAS He 's reformed . It 's awful to live with a reformed character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They double-discipline you to give themselves an illusion of virtue . p. 146 INES I did n't know my daughter was so penetrating . SERAFIN ( Gently ) But when did you discover that your husband was really Estramudo ? MANUELA VARGAS Just a few hours ago . SERAFIN But you already know one false Estramudo . Is n't it possible that your husband is another ? MANUELA VARGAS No , it is not possible . SERAFIN How do you know ? MANUELA VARGAS Because it 's been proved to me . SERAFIN How ? MANUELA VARGAS It 's been proved that he 's the genuine Estramudo . INES That lump ! ISABELLA GALVEZ That bluenose ! I 'll never believe it . SERAFIN Manuela , this may be an invention of your husband . How do you know it is the truth ? MANUELA VARGAS Because I 've seen the jeweled medallion the Sultan gave him out of gratitude . It 's inscribed , " To Estramudo . " It says , " For taking a load off my mind  --  from his friend the Sultan . " SERAFIN Manuela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He carries it in a little bag around his neck . INES I always wondered what was in that little bag . He 'd never let me touch it . ( On this disclosure the VICEROY has risen and gone into the house , following PEDRO . ) SERAFIN Go on , Manuela . MANUELA VARGAS And under the floor of our barn I found the most fabulous jewels ! Imagine  --  would n't you have thought that just once he 'd have had the generous impulse to say , " Manuela , just for tonight , put on Catherine 's stomacher " ? But he never did  --  he never let me have the stomacher . You have no idea the difference in a woman 's psychology a few trinkets makes . Why , he never even gave me so much as an earning ! SERAFIN Awake , Manuela  --  return to yourself  --  think of nothing  --  Manuela , awake . MANUELA VARGAS ( Prattling on ) Not one earring ! I could never marry a man who wandered in and out of ladies ' bedrooms on cobwebs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you insomnia right now . MANUELA VARGAS Even his childishness was adorable . If he were my husband  --  ah !  --  then dream would not have to go beyond reality . The near hill as wonder-making as the far hill  --  the rose outside the window , the fragrance of the invisible , ideal rose  --  the imagined caress merging with the actual  --  my husband and my lover both  --  that would be  --  that would be p. 148 SERAFIN It would be heaven , Manuela ! But wake  --  I beg you  --  wake ( The crowd begins to surge nearer . ) INES What 's the matter ? Ca n't you wake her ? ISABELLA GALVEZ What 's the matter ? What 's gone wrong ? SERAFIN ( Holding off the crowd with a gesture ) Do n't come near her  --  do n't touch her , she may die . ( Awed , the crowd desists . The VICEROY comes out of the house , the two soldiers following with the pinioned PEDRO . ) INES What is it , Excellency ? Why have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He never was your son-in-law ! INES What ? VICEROY This is n't Pedro Vargas . Pedro Vargas was the captain of a ship he scuttled . The Captain went down with his ship and he took his name . He is the real Estramudo ! PEDRO VARGAS ( Defiant ) Yes ! All these years she 's dreamt about me and all the time it was I ! ( Sensation from the crowd . ) SERAFIN ( Desperate over MANUELA ) Manuela  --  awake p. 149 VICEROY ( To his men ) Take him away ! We shall send you to the Capitol at government expense . PEDRO VARGAS ( Pleading ) Mercy ! VICEROY Why should I be merciful ? You have never shown mercy to others . However , we are engaged in a desperate war with that fiercely marine people , the Berbers . I may give you a captaincy . Your piratical experience should come in handy . PEDRO VARGAS I shall fight for you as only a reformed character can fight ! VICEROY We may try you . ( Nods to the men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow . SERAFIN ( Fired by this sudden vista , his voice rising ) Widow ! Manuela  --  awake  --  awake to widowhood ! INES If that does n't wake her , nothing will ! VICEROY What 's wrong , Mesmer ? It seems easier to induce a trance than to get out of it . MANUELA VARGAS ( Still prattling ) The trouble with me is that I 'm a homebody . He was willing to risk his life for me . Imagine , his life p. 150 SERAFIN Awake , Manuela ( He blows a horn and rings a bell in front of her  --  no effect . ) SERAFIN Oh , God , I ca n't wake her ! She wo n't wake ! ( The crowd surges toward him , some threatening . They shout suggestions . ) LIZARDA Mistress  --  beloved mistress  --  please wake up . It 's what they call a catalepsy ! ISABELLA GALVEZ ( Indignant , to SERAFIN ) What are you doing to my best friend ? CAPUCHO I 'll have you jailed for this . DON BOLO Use voodoo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattlesnakes ' skins and vinegar . ONE OF THE CROWD That cured my grandmother . ANOTHER Cut her laces . DON BOLO They say lizard 's milk and chili GIRL IN CROWD Burn a feather under her nose . LIZARDA Is she alive or dead ? ANOTHER GIRL She 's dead  --  she 's dead . ANOTHER GIRL A priest  --  send for the priest . p. 151 SERAFIN Sh ! VICEROY Have you lost your skill , Mesmer ? Where is your power ? SERAFIN Let me try again . Stand back . ( They all stand aside . The singing begins . SERAFIN passes his hands over MANUELA 'S face ) Manuela  --  it is I. It is Serafin  --  it is my love  --  it is our future  --  it is our happiness  --  it is reality . MANUELA VARGAS ( Sits up suddenly ) Where am I ? SERAFIN ( Close to her ) You are with me , Manuela  --  you are with me  --  forever and ever . MANUELA VARGAS Oh , this is a lovely dream . VICEROY ( Who has been watching with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induces matrimony ? INES The Gulf Stream . SERAFIN ( Picking MANUELA up in his arms ) I lied to you , my dearest . Do you forgive me ? MANUELA VARGAS There are two kinds of lies  --  lies like Pedro 's , intended to pervert the truth  --  and lies like yours , which widen the borders of experience , and open the windows of the imagination . They may some day blossom into those flowers of the soul that are called ideals . I shall follow you  --  I shall follow you to the end . ( SERAFIN starts walking toward MANUELA 'S house , carrying MANUELA in his arms . The crowd lifts its voice in song , a joyous epithalamium. )
