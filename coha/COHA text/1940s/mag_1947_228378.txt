TEMPESTUOUS PETTICOAT ( 272 pp. - Claire Leighfon-Rlneharf ( $3.50 ) . <P> Early in the century a fine , fiery Irish-Cornish lady named Marie Connor Leighton wrote throbbing serial stories with titles like Fires of Love and Sealed Lips . A copy boy waited in the hallway of her house in St. John 's Wood , London , to dash with the latest installments to Lord Northcliffe 's Daily Mail . The income kept her household going : six servants , four dogs , three children , a secretary and a husband . <P> In Tempestuous Petticoat , one of the children , Clare Leighton , now a U.S. wood engraver , has set out to remember mania in all her Edwardian glory . Mama first fell madly in love at ten ( with a window cleaner ) , published her first novel at 16 , and believed until the end of her life ( 1941 ) that the secret of a ladylike complexion was cold water , lemons and dry oatmeal , externally applied . <P> The Best Flannel . One consequence was that the main bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old lemon peels " turned all conceivable shades of blue and green mold . " Underneath a study table heaped with notes scrawled on brown paper bags , paste pots , unpaid bills and old quill pens sat an assortment of patient , sighing dogs-preponderantly Skye terriers , since Queen Victoria had been partial to Skyes . And since the dear Queen was whispered to have been partial to flannel underwear , garments of the best bluish-green Welsh flannel were generally draped over the study furniture and fireplace screen , to air . <P> Marie Leighton was adamant about airing . There was no better way to catch pneumonia , she said , than to wear a flannel garment that had not been properly warmed and aired . " And when it comes to things like chemises and drawers , which go next to the skin , it 's always on the safe side to let them go on airing for the better part of a week . " She was adamant on many points : furs mothproofed with pepper , the futility of female education , the social inadequacy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only a Unitarian but a less successful writer than she ( he wrote boys ' adventure stories ) . " You know perfectly well , Robert , " she said , " that I have no objection to being the member of the family to earn most of the money . But I do wonder what it would feel like to be a kept woman . " <P> Poet-Novelist George Meredith had been an early admirer , but had been dismissed because his beard was too bristly . Other admirers or callers came &; went-an old judge who claimed that he had loved 100 women , no more , no less ; the great Lord Northcliffe , who usually passed at least part of each visit relaxing prone on the floor . " There 's absolutely nothing to be surprised about in someone choosing to lie on his stomach , " Marie Leighton explained . " The sooner you children learn to accept any eccentricity as though it were a commonplace , the better equipped you will be for life . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
