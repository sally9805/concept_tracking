WAITT IS OUT , FELDMAN RESTORED AFTER ro INQUIRY Chemical Chief Is to Be Retired for ' Interests of Service ' but Gray Praises Past Record s TWO GENERALS CRITICIZED Lack of Judgment , Propriety ' Is Charged  --  Quartermaster Head Gives Assurances By WALTLR H. WAGGONER Special to Tam NEW YORE Tuns . WASHINGTON , ? Sept. 10 ? Gordon Gray , Secretary of the Army , accepted the retirement request of Maj. Gen. Alden H. Waitt today for the " best interests of the service , " and restored Maj. Gen. Herman Feldman to duty with the firm assurance the general 's " lapse of judgment " would not be repeated . General Waitt , Chief of the Army 's Chemical Corps , and General Feldman , Quartermaster General , were suspended from their duties by Secretary Gray . on July 16 . Mr. Gray cited the involvement of the two officers in the Congressional investigation into the alleged use of influence by so-called " five percenters . " At that time Mr. Gray held , on the basis of the inquiry into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their respective Army services , " had exhibited a lack of that judgment and sense of propriety which must be expected of persons in their positions . " Waitt 's Testimony Recalled In an appearance before the Senate " five percent " investigating committee , General Waitt testified that he had prepared a memorandum for Maj. Gen. Harry H. Vaughan , Military Aide to the President , that belittled the abilities of officers who might be eligible to succeed him as Chemical Corps Chief , and another appraising his own worth in terms that were almost entirely laudatory . It was brought out in the same hearings that General Feldman had supplied James V. Hunt , the contracto ? ' s representative , or alleged " five percenter " about whom the inquiry has revolved , with information about Government purchasing plans . General Feldman told Mr. Hunt in a letter that the information , although not " secret , " was such that he wanted it considered " confidential . " Today 's decisions by the Secretary followed an investigation by the Army Inspector General into the Congressional disclosures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal survey of the situation by Mr. Gray himself . Waitt Keeps Present Rank The Secretary said in a statement that he had " studied the record carefully " and " talked at length " with General Waitt , and , on the basis of his " previous good record , " placed him on the retired list at his present rank of major general . The general will draw retirement pay of $550 a month . " I found no evidence of dishonesty or conduct justifying trial by court-martial , " the Secretary continued in his statement . " I did find that during a period of thirty years General Waitt served the Army honestly and faithfully and that he made major professional contributions toward the development of the Chemical Corps . " However , in view of his recent irregular actions which have been the subject of Congressional inquiry , I have decided that it would not be in the best interests of  --  the service for him to continue his duties as Chief of the Chemical Corps . I have restored him to duty and have approved his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little less stern with General Feldman . " I find , " said the Secretary , " that in some of his relations with a contractor 's representative he committed errors of judgment which I do not condone and which , if repeated , would damage his usefulness as Quartermaster General of the Army . " Feldman 's Service Stressed Mr. Gray went on , however , to state that General Feldman 's previous Army service of forty-two years was , like that of General Waitt , " honorable and efficient . " " This record and his conversations with me have convinced me , " said Mr. Gray , " that there will be no repetition of this lapse of judgment and that he is. fully qualified to continue his assignment . I am gratified , therefore , that I was able to order him back- to duty as Quartermaster General of the Army today . " The specific charge on which Mr. Gray based his suspension of General Waitt covered Congressional evidence that the general " improperly furnished personnel data to an individual not in the military service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same evidence , according to Mr. Gray , indicated that General Feldman had " furnished to a contractor 's representative procurement information under circumstances which appear irregular . " Mr. Gray 's decisions in respect to the two Generals were made public at 11 o'clock this morning , and at 11:30 o'clock Maj. Gen. Floyd L. Parks , Chief of the Army 's Public Information Division , spoke to reporters briefly about the origin of Mr. Gray 's actions . Comment on Vaughan Refused He said- that General Waitt 's request had been made only this morning , and that Secretary Gray 's acceptance followed it . General Parks said that there had been " conversations " between the Chemical Corps head and the Secretary leading up to this morning 's announcement . The name of General Vaughan also came up this morning , as it had frequently in the " five-percenter " investigation . General Parks declined to comment on General Vaughan , however , indicating that that was the prerogative of the President . As for any pending action by the Army against its own Generals , General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Waitt , who would have completed his four-year term as Chief of the Chemical Corps on Nov. 29 , had been in the Army since Sept. 19 , 1917 , when , at the age of 24 , he was commissioned a temporary First Lieutenant in the old Sanitary Carps . His service lapsed for about two years shortly after the First World War , but it was to begin again for another twenty-nine-year stretch when he was commissioned a First Lieutenant in the Chemical Warfare Service on July 1 , 1929 . General Feldman , born 59 years ago in New York City , enlisted as a private in the Army in 1907 , and was commissioned as an officer in the course of the First World War . General Parks said that General Waitt would undergo a routine pre-retirement physical check-up on Monday .
