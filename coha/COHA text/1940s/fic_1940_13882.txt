AN old-fashioned house with a front porch , at 333 Orchard Avenue in Bakersfield , California . A large front yard , with rose bushes in bloom near the house . An orange and a lemon tree . A palm . Two eucalyptus . A cement statue of a lion on the lawn . A homeless family goes by in the street : MAN , WOMAN , THREE CHILDREN . ANN HAMILTON , a beautiful and rather elegant woman in her early forties , comes out of the house , looks around , walks about in the yard , to the gate , smells and cuts several roses , singing " the years , the years , they come and go , " and so on ; goes up onto the porch , sits down in the rocking-chair with a love-story magazine , waiting for nothing , least of all a telegram . GEORGIE AMERICANOS , Greek-American Postal Telegraph messenger , arrives , skidding , on a bicycle . GEORGIE You Miss Ann Hamilton ? HAMILTON I am . GEORGIE Well , a fellow by the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He sent you this telegram . Know him ? HAMILTON Barnaby Gaul ? May I read the telegram ? GEORGIE It 's collect . A dollar and eighty cents . It 's a long night-letter . Lots of people ca n't pay for collect telegrams now-adays , but they always want to know what 's in them just the same , so I memorize everything and let them know . Free . That 's my little gift to society . People are poor . A dollar and eighty cents is a lot of money . Know him ? p. 3 HAMILTON I 'm afraid there must be some mistake . GEORGIE Oh , no , there is n't . HAMILTON I do n't know anybody in Boston . Are you sure the telegram 's for me ? GEORGIE If you 're Ann Hamilton , it 's for you . Otherwise it ai n't . Mistakes sometimes happen . HAMILTON What 's that name again ? GEORGIE Barnaby Gaul . B-a-r-n-a-b-y , Barnaby . G-a-u-l , Gaul . We get a lot of different kinds of telegrams , but this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about love . HAMILTON Love ? GEORGIE That 's right . L-O-V-E , love . I 'll recite the message to you . It 's against the rules of the company , but to hell with the company . My sympathies are with the poor , not the rich . To tell you the truth , I 'm a radical . HAMILTON Are you ? GEORGIE Of course I 'm an American , too . My father 's Greek . He used to be a wrestler . My father 's father used to be a tobacco-grower in Smyrna , in the old country . We read philosophy . My name 's Georgie Americanos . HAMILTON How do you do ? GEORGIE How do you do ? p. 4 HAMILTON Wo n't you sit down , Georgie ? GEORGIE That 's all right . You lived in this house twenty-seven years ? HAMILTON I 've lived in this house all my life . My goodness , I 'm forty-four years old . GEORGIE You 're the lady , all right . My father 's been reading Greek philosophy to me for three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes out here from Boston , like he says he 's going to , will you let me come out and look at him ? HAMILTON If somebody 's coming here . GEORGIE He 'll be here . HAMILTON All right , Georgie , you can come out . What does the telegram say ? GEORGIE Can I bring my father ? He likes to meet people who 've traveled . HAMILTON All right , Georgie , your father , too . GEORGIE The telegram goes like this . ( Reciting the telegram ) Boston , Massachusetts . September 7 , 1939 . HAMILTON September 7 ? Today 's September 15 . GEORGIE Well , to tell you the truth , I lost the telegram . It was in my pocket . I do n't know how it got there . I always put telegrams in my hat . p. 5 HAMILTON Good gracious , Georgie , tell me what 's in the telegram , even if it is eight days old . GEORGIE Has anybody walked by in front of this house whistling Love 's Old Sweet Song lately ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GEORGIE Well , let me think a minute . Get everything straight . He sure is a nut . O.K. Here it is . " If you remember me , I am the young man with the red hair who walked in front of your house twenty-seven years ago whistling Love 's Old Sweet Song . " Do you remember him ? HAMILTON No , I do n't . Please recite the whole telegram . GEORGIE How could you forget a guy like that ? He goes on to say : " You were sixteen years old at the time . You had half a dozen roses in your hand . Four red and two white . I hardly noticed you when I went by , and then I came back and said hello , and you said hello . I said what is your name and you said Ann Hamilton . You did n't ask my name . We talked a minute or so and that was all . I made a note of the number of your house and the name of the street and went away . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love you . " Now , do you remember him ? HAMILTON No , Georgie . Is there anything more ? p. 6 GEORGIE Plenty ! There 's plenty more . He says : " I am coming back to you , even if you 're married and have five children . " How about it ? Are you ? Have you ? HAMILTON I 'm not married . GEORGIE Are n't you married ? HAMILTON No . Please finish the telegram , Georgie . GEORGIE Well , he says : " Get rid of everybody . Love is everything . I know , now . Nothing else matters . I will walk in front of your house again very soon and I will be whistling the same old sweet song of love . " They do n't usually send telegrams this way , even when they 're collect . They usually try to say everything in ten words . He says : " If you remember me , speak to me . If you do not speak , I shall know you have forgotten . Please remember and please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's the whole message , word for word . A dollar and eighty cents . Know him ? HAMILTON No , I do n't . GEORGIE Are you Ann Hamilton ? HAMILTON My name is Ann Hamilton . GEORGIE Well , he knows you . He sent you this message all the way from Boston . You 're going to speak to him , are n't you ? HAMILTON No , I 'm not . p. 7 GEORGIE Does n't love mean anything to you ? HAMILTON No , it does n't . Besides , the man 's crazy . GEORGIE Why ? Just because he has n't forgotten ? HAMILTON A girl of sixteen is liable to be polite and say a few words to any man who speaks to her . GEORGIE This is different . You must have been very pretty at the time . You 're not bad now . Do n't you remember holding half a dozen roses in your hand ? Four red and two white ? HAMILTON I 've cut roses from these bushes hundreds of times . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guy with red hair , whistling ? HAMILTON No , I do n't . I 'm not sixteen , Georgie . I 'm forty-four . GEORGIE Well , all I know is you mean everything in the world to this nut . This Barnaby Gaul . And by all rights he ought to mean everything in the world to you , too . HAMILTON Well , he does n't mean anything to me . GEORGIE I would n't be so sure about that . He may come by here and sweep you right off your feet . HAMILTON No , he won't. p. 8 GEORGIE Why not ? HAMILTON I 'm perfectly happy . GEORGIE Oh , no , you 're not . You ca n't fool me . You may be satisfied but you 're not happy . You 've got to be a little unhappy to be perfectly happy . Satisfied 's one thing , and happy 's another . ( Pause ) Socrates . ( PEOPLE go by ) Poor people . Homeless . No place to go . HAMILTON What 's he say in that telegram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Reciting ) " If you remember me , I am the young man with the red hair who walked in front of your house  --  " ( Whistling ) Listen . ( At the gate ) It 's him . Barnaby Gaul . He 's come back to you , just like he said he would . This is the greatest love story that 's ever taken place in the streets of Bakersfield , California . Speak to him . HAMILTON I do n't remember anybody like that . GEORGIE Speak to him . The man 's come all the way from Boston to see you again . He 's moved everything back twenty-seven years where it belongs . Say a kind word . HAMILTON I do n't know what to say . p. 9 GEORGIE Say anything . He 'll understand . HAMILTON ( At the gate ) Here he comes . Do n't go away , Georgie . GEORGIE Go away ? I would n't miss this for anything in the world . ( The PERSON who appears is a handsome man of fifty whose years are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant and unending . His hair is reddish , if not exactly red . His face is still the face of a young man . His figure is still that . His clothes are the casual clothes of a young man who has better things to think about . He is wearing an old straw hat , and he is carrying a straw suitcase . He is walking jauntily , and he is whistling . He notices ANN , stops whistling and stands ) HAMILTON Good morning . GAUL How do you do ? ( ANN and GAUL stare at one another a moment ) GEORGIE Wow ! GAUL Your son ? HAMILTON Yes . No . GAUL A handsome boy . HAMILTON He 's Greek . GAUL A classic and noble people . You have others ? p. 10 HAMILTON No . He 's a messenger . He brought your telegram . GAUL Telegram ? GEORGIE Sure . From Boston . GAUL Boston ? ( ANN turns and rushes into the house ) GEORGIE Were n't you just whistling Love 's Old Sweet Song ? GAUL I was whistling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful morning . The least a man can do is whistle . GEORGIE Did n't you walk down this street twenty-seven years ago ? GAUL My boy , I 've never been in this town before . GEORGIE Ah , for the love of Mike . ( ANN comes out of the house , holding half a dozen roses . Four red and two white ) GAUL Roses ! I have never seen roses more beautiful to behold . Nor have I seen anyone hold roses more beautifully . Nor have I seen them held any way at all by anyone more beautiful . GEORGIE It 's him , all right . GAUL Him ? Who ? GEORGIE Who ? You . Do n't you recognize her ? p. 11 HAMILTON Four red and two white . GEORGIE She remembers you . Do n't you remember her ? ( GAUL stares at ANN ) All right . ( He tears open the telegram ) Let me read the telegram for you , too . GAUL Telegram ? What telegram ? GEORGIE What telegram ! The collect telegram from Boston . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1939 . ( GAUL takes the telegram and reads it silently , glancing at ANN every once in a while ) GAUL " I love you . BARNABY GAUL . " GEORGIE Now do n't try to tell me you 're not Barnaby Gaul . GAUL Is this Bakersfield , California ? HAMILTON Yes , it is . GAUL Is this Orchard Avenue ? HAMILTON Yes . 333 . GAUL How can I ever ask you to forgive me ? GEORGIE You are Barnaby Gaul , are n't you ? GAUL Words fail me. p. 12 HAMILTON Oh , that 's all right . GEORGIE Were you ever in Bakersfield before ? GAUL Please try to understand . GEORGIE Were you in Boston eight days ago ? GAUL Forgive me . Both of you . I thought I was in Fresno . Let 's start all over again . From the beginning . ( He takes his suitcase and hurries away ) GEORGIE Do you remember anybody like that ? HAMILTON I do n't know how I ever could have forgotten . GEORGIE Are you sure this is the nut ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get ready , then . Whoever he is , here he comes again , and this time he means it . This time he knows where he is and who he is , and who you are . Do n't forget to speak to him or else he 'll just walk away and maybe not send a telegram again for another twenty-seven years . ( GAUL appears again , whistling " Love 's Old Sweet Song " ) HAMILTON Good morning . ( GAUL stops , turns , looks at ANN , sets down his suitcase , hurries to ANN and kisses her . She drops the roses one by one ) p. 13 GAUL Ann . I knew you 'd remember . I knew you 'd never forget . HAMILTON I thought I had forgotten , Barnaby . I even believed there was no one in the world like you . GAUL There is , however . There is . HAMILTON And then when I saw you , I knew how foolish I had been to think you would never come back . I could n't help it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftly , and always I stayed here alone , living in this house , rocking back and forth in this chair on this porch . The roses bloomed and faded . GAUL The poor roses . HAMILTON The song died . GAUL The poor song . HAMILTON The children I wanted were never born . GAUL The poor children . HAMILTON Barnaby , why have you stayed away so long ? GAUL Ann , you may remember there were wars . HAMILTON Oh ! GAUL And you may remember , Ann , there were great troubles . There were panics in which a man rushed with the crowd to no place . No place at all . And I , with the million others , ran , and ran , forgetting love , forgetting everything but the need for escape . Protection from police and disease . Hide-aways in fifty-cent rooms in large cities , in small villages . There were famines , Ann . p. 14 HAMILTON Oh , Barnaby , you were hungry ? GAUL Hungry ? Days , weeks , months years of hunger . Hunger for bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not glory . ( He embraces her ) There were disasters at sea . Shipwreck and storm . Floods and hurricanes , and a man off-balance falling in the street . Fear and shouting . No songs , Ann . There were distances , and barking dogs . Mountains to cross , and rivers and prairies and deserts . And wherever a man stood , his heart was far away , and wherever he went , his heart was not there . There was cold and few coats . There was ice and no fire . There was fury and stupor in the heart . As you dreamed here through the years , there was pain and forsakenness . There were accidents , Ann , with a man 's body embarrassed by helpless and ugly posture , the arm twisted , the leg out of joint , and the heart in fever of disgust , raging against the mice . GEORGIE What mice ? GAUL Mice ? Go away , boy . And the foolish people asking , Are you hurt ? Hurt ? My God , I have been attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and marching in the same military formation . There was snow and quiet , with the eyes of men staring out from secrecy and crime . There was hate , with the rain drenching the streets and the wind roaring around the buildings . p. 15 HAMILTON Oh , Barnaby . GAUL There were many things , Ann , to keep me away from you , as you dreamed here through the years . I remember the thirst I knew in Kansas City , and the bar-flies driving me mad . There were small things , Ann , insects and little words . Frowns and sneers . And big things . The stairway of the hotel on fire , and a man in his bare feet . There were moments , repeated a million times , that were useless to the years . And years that were meaningless to any moment . But I knew  --  always I knew , Ann  --  that you would not forget . I 've come a long way , through many things , and still your face is bright . Your eyes still young . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The errors that have been , I dismiss . Here , in your presence , I deny all I have known but good , since you are still by sweetness molded sweet . I here cease movement and begin dream , because here dream is real . Ann , I 've traveled across half the world . ( Solemnly ) I 'm tired , Ann . Now I must lie down in the sweet shade of love , and dream into the years of youth . The years of our youth , Ann . The years we have lost and shall now regain in the embrace of love . ( BARNABY embraces ANN . They go into the house . BARNABY turns and throws GEORGIE a coin ) GAUL My luggage , boy . ( GEORGIE picks up the suitcase and puts it just inside the house ) ( TOM FIORA , another Postal Messenger , arrives and settles his bike next to GEORGIE 'S ) p. 16 FIORA Telegram for you , Georgie . GEORGIE Telegram for me ? FIORA Yes , you . Here . Read it . GEORGIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get even with you some day , so how do you like that ? The telegram to Miss Ann Hamilton is not real . Ha , ha , ha . Your pal , Tom Fiora . " Ha ha ha ? What 's the big idea ? FIORA I told you I 'd get even on you . GEORGIE You put that telegram in my coat pocket ? FIORA That 's right . That 'll teach you to play tricks on me . GEORGIE You wrote that telegram ? FIORA I did n't write it . My brother Mike did . GEORGIE That 's what I call a low-down dirty trick , and a guy in the house there getting ready to sleep in the sweet shade of love . FIORA Serves you right . I told you I 'd get even . GEORGIE Well , what about that lady ? What about that wonderful lady who told him I was her son ? FIORA Tell her the truth . p. 17 GEORGIE The truth ? Ah , Tom , I never did like Italians . Greeks never did like Italians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a telegram like that ? FIORA Mike gets all kinds of funny ideas . He cut this lady 's lawn one day . She told him the story of her life . He knew she was lonely . GEORGIE Well , who the hell is this guy , then ? He 's not just anybody . Giving me a Canadian dime . Tom , I 'm going to tell the Manager . FIORA Go ahead . He 'll fire you , too . Then he 'll come out here and make a personal call and explain everything . GEORGIE No , he ca n't do that . It 's too late to do that . FIORA Come on . Let 's go back to work . GEORGIE O.K. , you rat . ( TOM goes ) If that guy breaks her heart I 'm going to tell my father to get a half-nelson on him and teach him some manners . Good-by , Miss Hamilton . HAMILTON Good-by , Georgie . GEORGIE Is he sleeping ? HAMILTON No , he wants to shave first . GEORGIE Aaah . I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get . p. 18 HAMILTON All right , Georgie . And thanks ever so much . GEORGIE Any time at all . ( He rides away ) ( GAUL , with lather on his face , comes out on the porch , followed by ANN . GAUL sings to ANN ) GAUL ( Singing ) I love to see the sun come smiling to the world ; I love to hear the wind go singing through a field ; I love to hear a love-bird singing in a tree , And I love to see a lovely face light up with love for me . CHORUS Of all the things I love , I love the mostSleeping in the shade of love.Sleeping in the shade of love , I love the most , my love.Of all the things I love to taste , Sweetest is the kiss of love.Dreaming in the shade of love , The kiss of love I love the most , my love.My love , of all the lovely things , Loveliest of all is you , Dreaming in the shade of love.Sleeping in the shade of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . I love to breathe the scent of earth and new-mown hay ; I love to taste the peach and berry ripe in May ; I love to feel the spray as I walk beside the sea , And I love to see a lovely face light up with love for me. p. 19 CHORUS ( GAUL guides ANN into the house . DEMETRIOS , a small middle-aged Greek with a big black mustache , pushes a lawn-mower into the yard , begins to cut the lawn , suddenly notices the roaring lion , roars back at it . GAUL opens an upstairs window ) GAUL Hey . You . That grass does not need cutting . DEMETRIOS I am American citizen . GAUL Even so , the grass does not need cutting . Have you got your first or second papers ? DEMETRIOS Second papers next month . GAUL All right , come back and cut the grass next month . DEMETRIOS Is this official ? GAUL Official . Now get your lawn-mower and get the hell out of here . ( DEMETRIOS hurries away with his lawn-mower . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family arrive , one by one . CABOT thoughtfully smells a rose and surveys the terrain . CABOT 'S family consists of LEONA , his wife ; NEWTON , nineteen ; AL , seventeen ; the TWINS , SELMA and VELMA , sixteen ; ELLA , thirteen ; HENRY , twelve ; JESSE , eleven ; SUSAN , ten ; MAUDE , nine ; LEMMIE , eight ; MAE , seven ; HARRY , six ; WILBUR , five ; and LUCY , four . LEONA is pregnant . The family is accompanied by RICHARD OLIVER , a newspaper man who is collecting material for a book . He is an oldish , partially bald young man who is very troubled . Also ELSA WAX , a large , plain young women wearing spectacles , who is a photographer for Life Magazine ) p. 20 CABOT Leonie , here we rest . OLIVER But , Mr. Yearling , this is somebody 's front yard . CABOT Do n't aim to do no harm . Just aim to rest a spell . Leonie 's going to have a baby soon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawn and lies down ) OLIVER Another baby ? When ? CABOT Leonie , when ? LEONA Two or three months , most likely . He 'll be my fifteenth . WAX You 're aiming to stay here till the little fellow comes , of course ? CABOT Do n't know why not . ( To AL ) Here , you . What are you always reading books for ? Shakespeare and things like that ? ( ELSA takes a picture ) LEONA When do you folks aim to leave us ? WAX I ca n't answer for Mr. Richard Oliver here . He 's aiming to write a novel about you folks , I believe . He 'll be with you for the next two or three years , most likely . I wo n't be half that long . LEONA I do n't reckon we could undertake to feed another mouth , what with the children growing up and needing things all the time , and another coming . p. 21 WAX Mr. Oliver wo n't be no trouble , hardly . CABOT Well , it ai n't so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having somebody around asking questions . ( Knocks notebook out of OLIVER 'S hand ) It 's more like never being able to lie down and sleep in the afternoon , without somebody waking up a body to ask if we know how to read or not , or if we want better working conditions . ( ELSA takes a picture of CABOT ) Or somebody else taking pictures of us all the time . We ai n't publicity mad . We know we ai n't society folk . If it 's pictures you want , there 's a world full of people who 're always fussing with soap and water , keeping themselves clean and nice-looking all the time . OLIVER I have no intention of getting in the way . Miss Wax ! If you please . The pitiable plight of these unfortunate people is not the concern of one man alone , but of the whole nation . CABOT Unfortunate ? I 've got my driver 's license . OLIVER Something 's got to be done for them . WAX All right , do something . What can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEONA That 's so . We do n't want nothing from nobody  --  hardly . Food . A place to sleep . A roof over our heads . Clothes . A little land to walk around in . Cows . Chickens . A radio . A car . Something like that . We aim to shift for ourselves , the same as ever . p. 22 CABOT A handful of vines to pick grapes off of to eat . A small melon patch . Good climate . Working conditions ? We aim to hire our help fair and square . WAX I do n't hardly guess this family 's typical . LEONA Oklahomans . That 's what we are . Do n't belong to no religious sex . Mind our own business . CABOT Live and let live . When do you folks aim to let us rest ? LEONA We like to be neighborly and all , but this following us around and spying on us do n't seem just right . WAX I wo n't be much longer . We 're going to call these pictures " Life Goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun of these people . WAX Do n't be silly . I 'm not making fun of anybody , except you . Because you think these people are pathetic . Well , they 're not . You are . Look at these people . Nothing can stop them . They 've got the stubbornness and fertility of weeds . And they 're not common , either . I 'm a photographer and I 've learned to see into things . Your vision is so bad , the only thing you ever see is the surface , and I do n't think you see that very clearly . For all we know one of these kids is a genius . ( Looking at AL ) This fellow looks like a genius : he reads Shakespeare . ( Looking at NEWTON ) On the other hand they may all be idiots . But how do we know the world is n't supposed to be inhabited by idiots , instead of silly people who want to get everything organized  --  like you ? p. 23 OLIVER You 're a Fascist . CABOT Talk ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since you intellectuals started following us around . OLIVER I 'm trying to help you people . With my novel , I hope to improve migratory agricultural labor conditions . CABOT Conditions are all right . I 'm a little tired , that 's all . I brought this family all the way from Muskogee , Oklahoma , in seven weeks , in a broken-down old Ford that cost sixty-seven dollars and fifty cents . OLIVER It 's not a question of a broken-down old Ford  --  ( HENRY hits OLIVER with a stick . OLIVER falls , and three boys leap on him ) CABOT No kicking , now ! Fair and square ! No gouging ! No biting ! ( BARNABY GAUL opens an upstairs window ) GAUL What 's going on around here ? Ann . Are these people relatives of yours ? HAMILTON I 've never seen them before . GAUL Do n't worry . I 'll get them out of here in two minutes . HENRY Oh , yeah ! ( Three boys run into the house . GAUL appears with the boys hanging on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the love of God , save me .

( HENRY and JESSE release their holds on GAUL . He rises to his feet ) GAUL What 're all you people doing in this front yard ? CABOT We aim to rest a while and catch our breath . ( HENRY leaps on GAUL 'S leg ) GAUL You aim to rest a while and catch your breath ? ( To HENRY ) Get away from me , you bashi-bazouk ! ( To CABOT ) Call off your children . CABOT Henry . Leave the boy alone . GAUL My God ! You 're not all one family , are you ? CABOT All excepting him and her . He 's a writer , and she 's a photographer . GAUL All the others yours ? CABOT More than half of them are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 25 GAUL Well , it 's been pleasant chatting with you . Now clear out of here . Go on up the street somewhere a couple of blocks . ( He starts to enter house , singing " Of All the Things I Love " ) CABOT We ai n't aiming to go no further just now . GAUL When are you aiming to ? CABOT After Leonie has the baby . GAUL After Leona has the baby . When will that be ? CABOT That wo n't be for a couple of months . GAUL A couple of months ? My God ! ( He moves to go ) HAMILTON Barnaby ! GAUL I ca n't stand noise and confusion and crowds of people in my private life . HAMILTON Barnaby ! You 're not going ? GAUL I 'm not staying . HAMILTON I 've already waited for you twenty-seven years . You just arrived . GAUL Ann , you 've got the most beautiful spirit in the world , but I ca n't hang around a house that 's surrounded by Indians . LEONA Oklahomans. p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell you now , and truthfully , that I shall never forget you . HAMILTON You 're angry and excited , Barnaby . You do n't know what you 're saying .

( Everybody rushes into the house ) OLIVER But , Mr. Yearling , you 'll get in trouble . This is still private property . Of course after the revolution  --  CABOT Ah , to hell with the revolution . AL ( Alone , on the steps ) What am I doing here ? I do n't belong to this man and this woman . I 'll go away . I 'll be truly alone , as every man must be . Good-by , my father .

JESSE ( Grabs his brother around the waist ) No . I wo n't go back . I am going with you . AL Jesse ! Listen ! I ca n't take care of you . I do n't even know if I 'll be able to take care of myself . Now go on back . JESSE Al , please take me with you . Please . AL I ca n't , Jesse . Now go on back ! ( He pushes JESSE , turns and runs ) JESSE You 're a hell of a brother !

OLIVER 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumbles out and falls on the ground , pushed by CABOT and NEWTON ) CABOT You stay away from us with your God-damn propaganda . We voted for Roosevelt . ( CABOT and NEWTON go back into the house ) p. 28 OLIVER I do n't know how I 'm going to be able to write this and give it social significance . ( Gets to his feet ) WAX Do n't be foolish . You just write what you wanted to write in the first place , and forget all these little complications . OLIVER I 'm disappointed . WAX You 've been betrayed . How dare they have personalities of their own ? It would be a little cruel if one of the brighter children wrote a novel about you . One of them might , you know . OLIVER Sometimes it seems impossible to be of help . WAX Be of help to who ? No one wants to help anybody but himself . OLIVER I ca n't figure you out . WAX You ca n't even figure out those simple people in the house . How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl ! OLIVER The trouble with you Vassar girls is , you 've got no faith . WAX And the trouble with you unpublished writers is , you have . Faith belongs to the great only . Foolish people are n't entitled to faith . They make trouble with it , for themselves and for everybody else . They gather their feebleness into crazy mobs that do n't understand anything except to insist . If you want the world to be better , be better yourself . p. 29 OLIVER Shut up ! WAX What ? OLIVER Shut up ! That 's what ! I do n't want to hear any more of this chit-chat . WAX You know it 's the truth . OLIVER Shut up , I said ! I love you ! JESSE Ha-ha-ha ! ( OLIVER studies JESSE . JESSE studies OLIVER . OLIVER takes some money out of his pocket ) OLIVER Here !

JESSE ( Picks up a rock and gets set to throw it ) Two bits . OLIVER You throw that rock , and I 'll break your neck . WAX Richard , be careful ! OLIVER Shut up , I said . I can take care of myself . JESSE ( Making a line with his foot ) Cross this line and see what happens . OLIVER It so happens , I 'm going the other way . JESSE Well , you better if you know what 's good for you .
