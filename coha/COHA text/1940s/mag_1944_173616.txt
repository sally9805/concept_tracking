The sad-eyed , barrel-chested roost-ruler of Puerto Rican politics bellowed with pain . This time , for a change , his three big rivals came out with echoes . How could they lose ? The issue was everybody 's sweetheart . <P> " I can not see any reason to justify why , in a good democracy , " cried Senate President Luis Munoz Marin , leader of the dominating Popular Democratic Party , " Puerto Rico should be denied the right to have complete self-government without limitation . " Independent-sounding amens came fast from all other party leaders-Union Republicans , Socialists , whatnots . <P> The noise of agony arose over what the U.S. Senate had done to a Home Rule Bill . Into a subcommittee the bill had gone in pretty , thought Puerto Rican politicos , and had come out hagridden . But the U.S. Senate promptly approved it ; sent it to the House last week . <P> The new Home Rule Bill , as edited by Democrat Dennis Chavez of New Mexico , committee chief , provides ; &gt; For an elective Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Attorney General by local election instead of by Presidential appointment . <P> &gt;For an island Coordinator of Federal Agencies instead of a more dictatorial Commissioner General . <P> Edited straight into the wastebasket was a Joint Advisory Council ( containing Puerto Rican members ) to initiate changes in the island 's political status . The subcommittee stood stanchly on its assertion that the U.S. Congress must " determine for itself at the proper time . . . the ultimate political destiny of the Island . " The Puerto Rican politicos cried in pain . Forthwith , the political campaign began . The great popular cause between now and the November Puerto Rican elections would be complete self-government , so far as the politicos were concerned . The issues closest to the hearts and stomachs of the two million hard-pressed people were still the economic and social problems of living jampacked into 3,435 square miles of an unindustrialized , one-crop country . Likeliest candidate for the new governorship was Roost-Ruler Marin , who has maintained his prestige by plugging for social and economic reform .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
