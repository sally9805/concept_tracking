txt New York 's serialized celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Greater City enters its climax today with the opening to the public of the Golden Anniversary Exposition at Grand Central Palace . This entertaining and enlightening show continues to Sept. 19 , and will offer New Yorkers an opportunity to understand their city better . In brochure terms , it gives the " stockholders " a chance to take inventory of the " achievements of yesterday , leadership of today and opportunities of tomorrow . " There are 8,000,000 of these tax-paying stockholders in 1948 . In fifty years we have grown from a city of 3,250,000 . As a sort of capital city of the world  --  a position reinforced by location of the United Nations headquarters here ? we symbolize the democracy and the opportunities of . America . No one has been fully successful in capturing New York within the covers of a book . The exhibits on the many thousands of square feet of Grand Central Palace can not , of course , convey more than a small part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performs will be portrayed , to tell us why nearly 200,000 men and women are on our city payroll , to man our subways , clean our streets , protect our safety from crime and fire , to teach our children , to guard our health , to carry on through a hundred departments and agencies the manifold functions that a great city today performs as the background of civilized life . We have a government that numbers in its employes alone enough men and women to populate a medium-sized city , in an establishment that raises by taxation , and spends , well over a billion dollars a year  --  more money than in any state budget in the United States , including that of New York State . But we are a city of superlatives in almost all other respects as well . Our greatness ? as a seaport , our position as a railroad terminus , our growing acceptance of responsibility as a focal point for travel and transport by air will have their places , of course , in the exposition exhibits . But these , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . We must go to the manufacturing , the stores , the shops , the theatres , the banks , the insurance companies , the markets , the apparel industry , the publishing houses to find what is basic to our prosperity and continued growth . It is a regrettable fact , for the cause of good government , that our leading business men , industrial and financial leaders take too small and remote an interest in the affairs of the city government . Some of them express such an interest , largely by proxy , through certain civic organizations . But this interest is occasional rather than steady , and it does not make itself influentially effective at City Hall . On the other hand our city government , notably in recent years , conceives of itself almost wholly as a defender of the common man  --  a praiseworthy objective  --  yet too seldom reckons the importance of taking into its confidence in partnership the business community , whose welfare so strongly determines in turn the welfare of the common man , its employe . There is far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the problems of taxation that bears directly on business . And business itself is far too indifferent to these same problems , until the blow strikes and it is too late to alter policy . New taxes are condemned as harmful to business , but rarely do the complainants acknowledge , as they should , the need for greater revenues and increased capital borrowing power in our enlarged city or propose better , substitute forms of taxation which would make our future as a business center more secure in competition with other cities . This gulf between our business leadership and the city government must be bridged , to cope more wisely with . the great problems of costly physical improvements required to serve our people well , and to achieve a more business-like administration of the city . Perhaps through this anniversary celebration , in which all of us try to see the city whole , will emerge a closer cooperation to build an even better New York of the future .                 @ @ @ @
