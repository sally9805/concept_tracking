Oldtime Vienna correspondents knew sharp-featured George Eric Rowe Gedye ( rhymes with steady ) as a cool little Englishman , always reserved and distantly polite , who could write with startling passion of his love ( Austria ) and his hate ( the Nazis ) . Last week they caught the Gedye touch in London Daily Herald pieces pleading that unless the Allies acted , Vienna would starve within 30 days . <P> Gedye was back again after five years . In 1940 , home-bound from Moscow , where he had been New York Times correspondent ( he is so no longer ) , Gedye stopped off in Istanbul-and promptly vanished from newsprint . The spotlight touched him briefly in 1942 when Turkish police arrested him , and the German press howled that he had been plotting the assassination of Franz von Papen . What he calls " confidential " methods got him out of jail ; he fled to Jerusalem , and there shouted a terse " nonsense " at the charges . Then the spotlight flickered out . <P> " Nothing Secret . " The fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind a cold , impassive exterior-had spent World War II in the Middle East " collecting confidential information , " ostensibly for the British Ministry of Information . It had been better than his World War I service as an intelligence officer ( " Nothing secret about it ! Just questioning prisoners ! " ) . It had almost satisfied his romantic dreams of 1925 , when , as a new correspondent in Vienna , he had stood in awe before the Chancellery on the Ballhaus Platz , where Metternich had planned his tricks . " The very address , " he wrote later with characteristic Gedye gusto , " was an echo of the spy thrillers by William Le Queux , who had filled my boyhood with the romance of international intrigue . " <P> As a Vienna correspondent , Gedye was a lone wolf . He steered clear of the Cafe Louvre , where such mutually admiring members of the Anglo-American press club as Marcel Fodor . John Gunther and Dorothy Thompson talked away the days over Kaffee mit Schlagobers , and pooled their findings . He drifted around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austria . <P> Sign on the Door . Editors did not find it too easy to get along with this chilly little ex-soldier . He made out best with the remote bosses of the New York Times : for 13 years he covered Vienna for them , for four years was their bureau chief . But the name on the door of a second little cubbyhole office he used was changed frequently . First it was the London Times ; then in succession London 's Express and Telegraph . As Hitler rose to power , Gedye 's impassioned warnings fell painfully on British ears . <P> Three days after the Nazis seized Austria , Gedye was escorted to the border ; He had offended : 1 ) by describing the cuffing German police had given some Austrian generals ; 2 ) by casting doubt on a Gestapo assertion that it had arrested only 600 Austrians . In Prague Gedye continued his fight , sending bitter pieces to his papers , ' writing a book ( published as Fallen Bastions in England , Betrayal in Central Europe in America ) .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
