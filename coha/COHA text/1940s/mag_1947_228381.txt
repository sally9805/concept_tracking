THE AMERICAN THESAURUS OF SLANG ( 1,231 pp. ) - Lesfer V. Berrey and Melvin Van den Bark-Crowell ( $6.50 ) . <P> American slang breeds faster than editors can edit or printers can print . The original edition of the mammoth American Thesaurus of Slang ( TIME , March 2 , 1942 ) had more than 100,000 words &; phrases in it . By the time it hit the bookstores , it was already slightly arky . Now Lester V. Berrey and Melvin Van den Bark have provided 5,000-6,000 more terms , partly teen-age talk , partly military slang , for a new , enlarged edition . A good many of the contributions sound like a disc jockey 's idea of how a real , live jazz fan talks . Samples : <P> satisfactory : creamy , darby , glassy <P> unsatisfactory : creepy , drooly , gleepy <P> unpopular person : drizzle , drone , fumb , glom , herkle , hinkle , square , toad <P> confused : miced up <P> silly talk : mahaha <P> character labels : Austin from Boston , fluke from Dubuque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Erie , mute from Butte , noisy from Boise , pester from Chester , skunk from Podunk , trixie from Dixie.
