<P> The Union of South Africa has long had language trouble . Of its citizens , 1,226,382 speak Afrikaans ( a simplified version of Dutch ) ; 875,541 speak English ; only 35,889 speak both . Since the country was officially declared bilingual in 1925 , all official communications were supposed to be written in both Afrikaans and English ; but in bureaucratic practice , a letter written in English was answered in English , a petition phrased in Afrikaans answered in Afrikaans . Last week the Department of Defense decided to end this haphazard arrangement . Setting a fashion which the whole government is expected to follow soon , the Department decreed that henceforth all its official correspondence will be carried on with strict impartiality-in Afrikaans one month , in English the next .
