txt The Communist members who joined the Constituent Assembly 's unanimous vote for President de Gaulle last Tuesday withdrew their support tonight and proposed to the other parties that they should elect Felix Gouin , the Assembly 's chairman , President of the Provisional Government . The switch in attitude developing from their controversy with M. de Gaulle over Cabinet representation became flat opposition as a result of M. de Gaulle 's broadcast yesterday in which , the Communists declared , he insulted their honor . They condemned his speech to the nation as contrary to " democratic " traditions and " an insult to 5,000,000 voters whose national allegiance he questioned . " Because of his partisan attitude toward their party , the Communists said , M. de Gaulle has disqualified himself to form a union cabinet . They announced that , when the Assem , bly met tomorrow to decide on his resignation , they would not vote for him again . Letter Clarifies Position M. de Gaulle , in a letter to M. Gouin , made it clear that he did not consider that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decide whether he should withdraw or try to form a government on another basis than the national unity that he failed to obtain . Maurice Schumann , the head of the Popular Republicans , declared that his party would never support any candidate other than M. de Gaulle . M. Gouin , whom the Communists adroitly proposed to succeed him , is a Socialist without a strong personality , a man of the type that always won the pre-war Presidential elections in France . He is the kind who might be counted on to take the job of President as a decorative position and fulfill its functions with dignity but who would not interfere with the political plans of the legislative body . In proposing a Socialist instead // of one of their own members , the Communists took the opportunity to strengthen the wavering Socialist adherence to the program that the two parties endorsed in common . In attacking M. de Gaulle 's action in stepping into the political arena with his speech last night , they sought to play on all democratic elements in the Assembly to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separately to consider the Communists ' proposal . They were expected to hold a late night sitting together in an effort to agree on what course to take when the Assembly met tomorrow . The meeting of fifteen representatives of the three main Parliamentary parties broke up early on Monday morning without having reached any decision , Reuter reported . They will meet later in the day before the Assembly 's afternoon session . M. de Gaulle 's fate thus appeared to depend on the final attitude of the Popular Republicans , who up to now have steadfastly maintained that they would vote for no other candidate . His radio speech attacking the Communists , according to many observers , had weakened M. de Gaulle 's position , which throughout the past week had drawn its main strength from the fact that he stood above politics and was not even asking reelection . He dropped from both positions by his address to the nation , in which he appeared to seek re-election . One possibility that M. de Gaulle 's , supporters certainly had in mindl -- the Assembly 's inducing the Communists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Gaulle 's terms  --  is now considered out of the question , since it is generally felt that his radio speech and the public airing of the controversy over the Communists ' national worthiness has permanently alienated them from M. de Gaulle . " Since de Gaulle refused us his confidence , " l'Humanitk , the Communists ' organ , said , " why should we give him ours ? " Police on Alert PARIS , Nov. 18 ( EP ) ? Strong forces of police were posted in the Place de l'Opera and other strategic points in the center of Paris tonight as a precaution against possible rioting . There was no sign of disorder but feeling was increasingly tense as the crisis neared its climax . During the day police dispersed a demonstration of students in favor of M. de Gaulle in the Place de l'Opera . There was a demonstration of 1,500 persons in favor of M. de Gaulle in Marseille . The Communists received a setback when the Socialists , after a caucus , announced that they would not take part in any two-party government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
