If , in 1944 , Republicans keep all their present seats in the House of Representatives , they have only to win nine more to become the majority party , and the Republican Governor and legislature of Pennsylvania are doing their best to help . By a hoary political operation made famous by Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry , * they have now all but clinched five of the nine seats . <P> On the outskirts of Pittsburgh , scattered among three Congressional districts , are labor votes which in 1940 were sufficient to elect Democratic Congressmen from all three districts . Fortnight ago , Governor Edward Martin signed a bill , passed by the legislature after an eight-day Democratic filibuster , which neatly amputated these Democratic areas , added them superfluously to the safely Democratic Pittsburgh district . A similar operation was performed on two Philadelphia districts . <P> Democrats moaned in the immemorial anguish of the gerrymandered . Cried they : " Steal , " " dastardly , " " foul blow . " Replied Governor Martin : " It 's just the good old American way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bellyached when they ran over us . It just has to be done . " <P> In Congress , balding , soft-spoken Representative Herman P. Eberharter , New Dealer from Pittsburgh , introduced a bill to forbid between-census reapportionment . But even he admitted sadly that : 1 ) his bill had no chance of passing ; 2 ) it was too late anyway . He and other Democrats threatened a court fight . Republicans stayed smug and happy . <P> *Elbridge Gerry ( 1744-1814 ) , signer of the Declaration of Independence , fierce antiFederalist , ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Massachusetts four times , was elected on his fifth try , subsequently reelected . He approved a bill which carved a state senatorial district in Essex County into an absurd shape , but gave the Federalists no chance of winning . At a Federalist rally , an artist ( legend says it was Gilbert Stuart ) drew a head , wings and claws on a map of the district , shouted : " That will do for a salamander . " Cried a voice in the crowd : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
