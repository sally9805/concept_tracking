The dream of rain making is as old as man . For centuries , Chinese suppliants , barechested , short-trousered , and wearing bands of green grass about their heads , have paraded with their dragons and beaten gongs to bring rain . In the U.S. , Indians still propitiate the Thunderbird with symbolic dances . <P> With the help of science , the dream has at last become reality . Across the land , flyers were making rain by simply dropping 100-lb. loads of pulverized dry ice ( solidified carbon dioxide ) into cumulus clouds , thus precipitating ice crystals which turn into rain . This week , sweltering Chicago got an 8-to-18 degree break in a heat wave just when a plane hired by the Herald-American brought man-made rain . The Herald-American , of course , claimed the credit . For days previously , others had been doing it : <P> In Richmond , Flying Instructor Brock Minor scattered 50 lbs . of dry ice into a cumulus cloud at 8,400 feet , brought the city its first shower in two weeks . <P> A Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ill. , by " seeding " a 20,000-ft. cumulus cloud with 150 lbs . of dry ice . <P> In Coleman , Tex. , long drought had dried up the town 's only lake . Coleman was on the point of importing water by tank car when two local flyers dropped 100 lbs . of dry ice from 18,000 feet , brought a reported 2-in. rainfall . Next day they tried again , this time produced a 1-in. fall . <P> In Fort Worth , the Ed Ritchey Flying Service , supplied by the Parker-Browne Co. , a big dry-ice producer , took up rain making as a business , brought one shower in its first two tries . <P> In Kansas City , big , hard-driving Kenneth Spencer , whose Spencer Chemical Co. has leased the Government 's $20 million Jayhawk Ordnance Works ( TIME , June 17 , 1946 ) , turned to rain making as a possible stimulant for his dry-ice sales . Spencer hired a crop-service plane , succeeded in bringing showers to Mission , Kans. , Excelsior Springs , Mo . This week five farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain over their arid 1,500 acres ; it made rain all right-over a golf course , leaving their farms still dry . <P> The new rainmaking method was developed only last year at General Electric Co. ' s Schenectady , N.Y . laboratories by Engineer Vincent J. Schaefer and Nobel Prizewinner Dr. Irving Langmuir ( TIME , Nov. 25 ) . <P> Since it costs only $3 to $5 for the dry ice , plus the expense of the plane , the commercial possibilities are being explored by increasing numbers of flyers , chemical manufacturers . No one is more interested than the rain-starved farmers of the Corn Belt .
