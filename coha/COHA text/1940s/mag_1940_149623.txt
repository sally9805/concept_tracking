One day last week President Roosevelt opened his press conference in a mood of great good humor . Correspondents in the front row saw all the sure signs that the President was waiting to spring something - he pursed his lips , stretched his big cheeks and rolled his tongue against them as he stared at the ceiling-an omen from which Washington newsmen deduce the Presidential mood as fishermen scan the sky for breaks in the weather . A blurt by Secretary Steve Early helped start the conference-as they seldom start these days-with a laugh . The President announced that at 2:45 the next day he would dedicate three schools- " three at once . " Quickly Steve Early corrected him : " At a quarter to three ! " When the laughter subsided and routine questions were out of the way , Washington Times-Herald 's Earl Godwin leaned over the President 's desk , asked sonorously : " Mr. President , do you have any reason to believe that Germany and Italy are working for your defeat in this election ? " <P> This was the moment Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New York Times , he wondered whether correspondents had read a story from Rome by a man named Matthews-Herbert Matthews , was n't it ? - that had amused him ( see p. 50 ) . Slowly and distinctly , he read : " . . . The Axis is out to defeat President Roosevelt . . . . The . . . election is of vast importance to the Axis . Therefore the normal strategy for the Axis is to do something before November 5 that would somehow have a great effect on the electoral campaign . " <P> Said the St. Louis Post-Dispatch 's Pete Brandt : " It 's a pretty good ad . " <P> Asked Scripps-Howard Reporter Fred Perkins : " Have you any reason to believe that it is true ? " <P> President Roosevelt merely replied that he was quoting the press back at the newsmen . The implication that Hitler and Mussolini wanted him out-first advanced by Henry Wallace , offered last week by Governor Lehman-now had more than tacit sanction of the President himself . Wallace had been reproved by many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garrison Villard , " It seems to me that your declaration that a vote for Willkie will be a vote for Hitler . . . touches the low-water mark of unfair , unjust and intolerable partisanship . . . playing upon passions and prejudices which you ought to be the last man in the State of New York to do " ) . But the President 's added comment was , although oblique , much stronger . <P> Said the New York Times : " We are under no illusion that Hitler and Mussolini like Mr. Roosevelt . We are under no illusion that they will like Mr. Willkie any better , in case he is elected , for Mr. Willkie is just as vigorously pro-America , and just as bitterly anti-Axis , as Mr. Roosevelt , and it is entirely possible that , by preventing economic disintegration in the United States and assuring a more rapid production of airplanes and other war supplies , both for the United States and England , he would give the Axis even more to worry about .
