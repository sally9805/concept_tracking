&gt; The largest number of votes ever cast in a U.S. Presidential election was 49,815,000 ( in 1940 ) . <P> &gt; Only once ( 1936 ) has a President received over 6,000,000 more votes than his opponents . <P> &gt; By next year 's Presidential election , the U.S. will have an estimated 9,000,000 men &; women of voting age in uniform . <P> Many a U.S. politico mulled over these facts this week . For the first time in history , soldiers &; sailors will find it easy , under a law passed by Congress in 1942 , to vote in next year 's Presidential election . For the first time in history , the Army &; Navy form a potent voting force-18% of 1940 's vote , enough ballots to have decided all but one of the past Presidential elections . <P> If enough men &; women in uniform cast ballots , they could swing 1944-3 election . No one expects the U.S. Army &; Navy , composed of Smiths and Smythes , to vote as a unit . But , conceivably , the candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next President . <P> Fireside in Sicily . This week 's flurry of excitement over the soldier vote came after Franklin Roosevelt stole a march on all other 1944 candidates . For the first time since February , Franklin Roosevelt sat before a battery of microphones , carrying his message all over the world , to deliver a report to his constituents from Florida to Washington and from Alaska to New Delhi . <P> As a fireside chat , his speech was not likely to be long remembered . He cited well-known facts on the progress of the war , repeated the United Nations demand for Italy 's unconditional surrender , touched briefly on the home front . ( Sections on inflation , food and manpower were cut out and saved for another forthcoming address . ) <P> But for nearly five of his 30 minutes , Franklin Roosevelt talked on a subject which no U.S. politico can henceforth forget . He laid down an official Administration program to take care of returning soldiers at the end of the war , thus warming the firesides in Sicily and chilling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fire over Spongier . In Congress , members of both parties have been readying bills to ease demobilization . But Franklin Roosevelt , firing a shot heard round the world by short wave , now stood out as the No. 1 champion of largess to World War II 's veterans . <P> Republicans , shot while napping , clutched hands to pain-stricken breasts . Cried New Hampshire 's Senator Styles Bridges : " The President dangled before the eyes of the soldiers a gift of their own tax money . . . . " Cried Pennsylvania 's Congressman J. William Ditter : " The President 's speech degenerated into the official opening of the fourth term campaign . . . . " <P> Chairman Harrison Spangler of the G.O.P. National Committee , brooding over the 2,000,000 soldiers abroad who hear more about the President than about his Republican opponents , demanded that the War and Navy Departments publish the Bridges-Ditter comments in Army newspapers and ship bulletins . Said he : <P> " Every American is determined to take care of these returning heroes . It will be the nation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . "
