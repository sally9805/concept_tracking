The Hays office , keeper of Hollywood 's screen morals , not long ago forbade Republic , home of the Hollywood Western picture , to use the classic phrase , " Reach , buddy ! " , because it suggested excessive gunplay . Last fortnight the Hays office almost broke Republic 's heart by scissoring the words , " Head for the border , boys ! " , from another Western : they intimated that the U.S. 's good neighbor , Mexico , was a haven for outlaws . <P> <P> The New Pictures <P> The Spoilers ( Universal ) is a great Hollywood tradition . Rex Beach wrote the Alaskan adventure tale for all it was worth 36 years ago . Eight years later Hollywood made it into a silent picture starring He-Men William Farnum and <P> Tom Santschi . Shrewd Sam Goldwyn did it again in 1923 with Milton Sills and Noah Beery , and Paramount repeated in 1930 with leathery Gary Cooper and William Boyd . <P> This time it 's strong John Wayne , who owns the gold mine , v. Randolph Scott , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dietrich in the background , always ready with a knife or a hard word . As Cherry Malotte , proprietor of Nome 's Great Northern saloon , she is back in her Destry Rides Again role -a Bad Girl with a nugget heart . <P> Now 37 , Saloonkeeper Marlene is quite at home in her rough- &-tumble; role . Strong men quiver as she coaxes them on with : " Anything you can win you can collect . " Nobody but Miner Wayne , who has already had the best years of Cherry 's life , collects much . He gets her , his appropriated mine , and a beautiful going-over to boot . All ends well in the sturdiest of melodramas . <P> Spoilers is renowned for its long , concluding brawl between villain and hero . The current version ( Wayne v. Scott ) is a beaut . It begins in Cherry 's overstuffed quarters on the saloon 's second floor , ranges round the balcony , down to the barroom , smashing everything in sight , continues out through the front window into the street . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero together and chides : " That 's enough now ; come on . " <P> But it is Version I ( Farnum v. Santschi ) that Hollywood and oldtime moviegoers like to recall . It set the pattern for future film brawls , became a pressagent 's superlative for the ultimate in cinema scraps . It started small , but , according to Actor Farnum ( still hale and hearty enough to undertake a small role in Version IV ) , it grew after Villain Santschi broke his nose on the first swing . Says Farnum : <P> " I thought he 'd hit me on purpose . So I waited for an opening . &gt; Then I let him have it . After that we were both punch drunk . The people on the sidelines . . . yelled , ' Stop them ! They 're killing each other ! ' He caught me over the left eye and I spurted blood like a stuck pig . . . . <P> " Dear old Tom ! We got to be great friends afterward . We smashed a bookcase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and then it went over . It should have killed us . ... At the end I got a good shoulder lock on Tom , and I bent him back . . . until I heard him groan . . . . Then I had sense enough to let go . ... <P> " I 've never been quite the same man since . . . . Besides the broken nose , I had two bent ribs and a crushed sinus in my cheek that gave me fainting spells for years . " <P> There were giants in those days .
