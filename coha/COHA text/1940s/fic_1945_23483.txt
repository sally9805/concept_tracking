The author of The Late George Apley , H. M. Pulham , Esq. , and So Little Time went to the Pacific last spring as correspondent for Harper 's . LUNCH AT HONOLULU A Story JOHN P. MARQUAND HE . house was off Nuannu beyond the cemetery where Hawaiian royalty ? lay with symbolic tabu sticks at the corners of their burial plots . It was a fine clear day by the sea , but rain was falling up by the jagged skyline of the mountains . Mr. Huntley knew that in Honolulu they called it liquid sunshine . The house to which he was invited for lunch was built of rough coral stone and redwood , and a porte cochere covered the drive . The house might have been in Redlands , California , except for the ornamental planting . It was said that almost anything could grow on the Hawaiian Islands . By the time the taxicab had stopped beneath the porte coch &e,; Mr. Huntley had identified upon the lawns a traveler 's palm , an Alexandra palm , a Norfolk Island pine , ginger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snapdragons , and forget-me-nots . There was also some bamboo and banana . This dizzying combination gave its own horticultural evidence that Honolulu was the melting pot of races and the crossroads of the Pacific . Even before Mr. Huntley had climbed the steps , a middle-aged Japanese maid had opened the door . Her hair was done in Japanese convention . She wore the kimono and the obi . When she bowed and took his hat , she looked like a part of the chorus of Madame Butterfly . Inside , the long living room was cool and shadowy , paneled with a glistening darkish wood . There were reed mats on the dark , highly polished floor . There were comfortable American upholstered chairs and Chinese lacquered tables . There were Hawaiian calabashes filled with ginger flowers . There was a large Capehart phonograph , and on the wails were Chinese ancestral portraits , an oblong of old tapa cloth , and some Malay weapons . The Japanese maid smiled . Before she put her hand in front of her mouth , she revealed three black teeth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politely . " Mr. Wintertree , he waits , on the back lanai , please , " she said . " This way , please . " As Mr. lluntley followed her , he had a glimpse of himself in a cloudy ornate Italian mirror . His image was disturbing in a shadowy room that was heavy with the scent of tuberoses . He was an incongruous stranger , a moist , dumpy , middle-aged interloper in a wrinkled Palm Beach suit . Mr. Win tertreewas on the back veranda . The veranda , furnished with wicker chairs , potted ferns , and hanging air plants , looked over a deep green tropical gorge to the darker jagged mountains . To the left , far below , were the streets and houses of Hono-lulu and the docks and the Aloha Tower , and the harbor and the sea . Mr. Winter-tree was a tall cadaverous man . He was dressed in an immaculate linen suit . His face was deeply tanned . His hair was as white and as smooth as his coat . " Aloha , Mr. Huntley , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come and take pot luck . Mrs. Wintertree was dreadfully sorry she could n't be here . It 's her day at the Red Cross , so it will be a slag party  --  just five of us . Admiral Smedley is coming with Captain Rotch , his Flag secretary . Henry D. Smedley  --  you know the Admiral ? ' " No , I have never met him , " Mr. Huntley answered . " I hope I 'm not too early . " " Oh , no , no , " Mr. Wintertree said . " They 'll be here any minute now . Just the Admiral and a Captain Rotch , and Lieutenant ? " A slight frown appeared on Mr. Wintertree 's face . " What the devil is his name ? Oh yes , Wright . A Lieutenant Wright . He 's just off a carrier . Walter Jones wrote me about him , too . He 's a naval aviator . Did you ever hear Walt mention him ? " " No , not that I remember , " Mr. Huntley said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It 's always a pleasure to see a friend of old Walt 's , " Mr. Wintertree said . " Maybe he told you , we were together in the class of ' 08 at Yale . When did you last see Walt ? " " In New York last month , " Mr. Huntley told him . " Walt told me to be sure to look you up . " " I wish you could see this place the way it used to be before the war , " Mr. Winter-tree said . " It 's the duty of kamaainas to make malihinis like the islands , but Honolulu is a madhouse now . Army , Navy  --  they 're into everything . They 'll be taking over the golf club next . " " What 's a kamaaina ? " Mr. Huntley asked . Mr. Wintertree smiled . " That 's a Hawaiian word , Roughly translated it means oldtimer , ' " Mr. Wintertree said . " I 'm an oldtimer and you 're a malihini . This is a kamaaina house . Father built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a small Pacific island then . My God ! how it'schanged . " He leaned back in his chair . " You have a beautiful view from this porch , " Mr. Huntley said . " Lanai , not porch , " Mr. Wintertree told him . " I suppose we 're eccentric the way we cling to Hawaiian words . This is a lanai , and that couch over there is called a hikkiai . It 's a real Hawaiian hikkiai , not just a couple of mattresses the way they make them now . You can see it is made out of lahala mats , the woven leaves of the pandanus tree . " " Hikkiai , " Mr. Huntley repeated . " Good , " Mr. Wintertree said . " That 's the way to say it . " " What do you do with it ? " Mr. Huntley asked . " Why , you lie on it , " Mr. Wintertree said . " Do you want to lie on it ? " " No thanks , not now , " Mr. Huntley answered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Those light-colored trees that you see on the side of the mountain are kukui trees , " said Mr. Wintertree . " They have small round nuts called kukui nuts . In old times the Hawaiians would string those nuts on a reed and use them for candles . My father used to say that when he was a child his father  --  we come of missionary stock  --  used to say , ' Children , one more kukui nut and it 's bedtime . ' " Mr. Huntley glanced at a low table , hoping to find a cigarette . " When my father was a boy , " Mr. Wintertrec said , " he spoke of seeing a little crowd of native Hawaiians on the docks , about where the Aloha Tower is now . We were all friends in those days . Those Polynesian boys were looking at something and laughing two bluebottle flies . Yes , they had never seen a fly , and now we have everything  --  flies , Marines , planes , battleships . I suppose you 're out here for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mr. Huntley . " I 'm out for the OWL " " What 's the OWI ? " Mr. Wintertree asked . " That 's a native American expression , " Mr. Huntley said . " Now , now , " Mr. Wintertree told him . " Do n't forget that we 're just as native American here as any other part of America . " He looked at his wrist watch . " I 've never known Admiral Smedley to be so late . Wait  --  I 'm wrong . I think I hear him now . " Ristc , and somewhat heavy steps sounded on the floor of the living room . It was Admiral Sinedley , followed by Captain Rotch . The Admiral 's glance was sharp and direct . His face was set in tranquil lines , like the bust of a Roman emperor . His gray hair was cut very short . He was dressed in fresh khaki . He wore two tiny silver stars in his shirt collar . On his finger was a Naval Academy ring . " We 're just waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A friend of a friend of mine . He is just off a carrier  --  Lieutenant Wright . " " That must be the Great Lick , " the Admiral said . " She ran into a little difficulty . What did you say the officer 's name was ? " " Wright , " Mr. Wintertree answered . " I do n't know him , " the Admiral said . " Rotch , did you ever hear of anybody named Wright ? " " No , sir , " the Captain said . " Well , it 's a big Navy , " the Admiral said . " And the Pacific 's a big ocean . " " We might have something to drink while we 're waiting , " Mr. Wintertree said . " Would you care for something , Admiral ? Sherry or a Martini ? ? or a little of our Island drink , Okulehau ? " " Okulehau , I have n't had any of that since I was stationed here in ' 32 , " the Admiral said . " We used to call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the Boss falls off the wagon , I guess I can fall , too , " the Captain said , and he laughed . Admiral Smedley smiled faintly . " I hope you 'll excuse me if I do n't join you , " Mr. Wintertrec said . " I very seldom indulge in the middle of the day , but Taka and Togo will give you anything you want . Would you care for a Martini , Mr. Huntley ? " " Thank you , " Mr. Huntley said . The Japanese maid came through the door on the far end of the porch , which evidently led to the dining room . She carried a large tray of dark wood , upon which were small plates of olives and otherappetizers . Behind her came an old Japanese in a white coat with bottles , ice , and glasses . " Taka and Togo have been with us for thirty years , " Mr. Wintertree said , and he lowered his voice . " They were very unhappy on December 7th . " " So was I , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , Mr. Huntley ? " " Oh , no , " Mr. Huntley said . " I 'm with the OWI . I 've only been here about a week . " " Oh , a writer , are you ? " the Admiral asked . " Well , there 's a lot to write about . " " You have a beautiful view from this veranda , " Mr. Huntley heard Captain Rotch say to Mr. Wintertree . " Yes , we think it 's a very pleasant lanai , " he heard Mr. Wintertree answer . " You see it faces both Mauka and Makai . Those are the old Hawaiian words for the sea and the mountains , Captain Rotch . They form two of the cardinal points on our island 's compass . Those fight-colored trees on the mountainside are called kukui trees . " " Let 's see , " the Admiral said to Mr. Huntley . " I think I have read something that you have written . Did n't you write an article for the Saturday Evening Post about trailers ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes , maybe it was someone else . Did you fly out , or come by boat ? " the Admiral asked . " I flew out , " Mr. Huntley told him . " You can get places flying  --  anywhere in the world in two days ' flying , " the Admiral said . " It 's a great place , Honolulu . We 're certainly lifting its face for it . Give us another year and we 'll make it look like Pittsburgh . No one 's ever going to say again that America ca n't fight a war . Thank you . " He took a glass from the tray that was passed him . The Japanese houseman bowed and smiled . He was a very polite old-time Japanese . " This is like the old days , " the Admiral called . " This is real Oke , Wintertree . " " It comes from the big island , " Mr. Wintertree answered . " They used to make it in the old days  --  that was during prohibition  --  but there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong kind . This is the right kind . It was made from the root of the ti plant . You 've seen its leaves on dinner tables , Admiral . In the old days the Hawaiians would break off a ti plant and sit on it and slide down a mountain slope . It was one of the old royal sports . " " Yes , I 've heard they did , " the Admiral said . " In my spare time I 've been making a little study of the Polynesians . I 've got a dictionary of Hawaiian words . " " It will be useful to you , " Mr. Winter-tree said . " Hawaiian words still crop up in kamaainas ' conversations . " " Some of the words are very expressive , " the Admiral said . " Do you know the word for cat ? " But Mr. Wintertree did not answer . He was moving to the living room door , to shake hands with the last of his guests , Lieutenant Wright . Lieutenant Wright had a piece of adhesive tape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fresh and young . His voice was loud and mellow . A N ! how do you do , sir , " Lieutenant Wright said . " Thanks for letting me aboard . I hope I 'm not too late to snap onto a drink . " " 011 ? not too late at all . I am very glad you could come , Lieutenant , " Mr. Wintertree told him . " As soon as I heard from your uncle Walt . . " Lieutenant Wright laughed so loudly that Mr. Huntley saw the Admiral 's forehead wrinkle . " Uncle Walt would have given me hell if I had passed you up , " Lieutenant Wright said . " Yes , sir . Uncle Walt told me if I ever hit this rock to look you up , sir , and now I 've hit it . " He looked at Mr. Huntley 's glass . " Is that a Martini I see him drinking ? " " Yes , that 's a Martini , " Mr. Wintertree said . " And this is Admiral Smedley , Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do , Admiral , " Lieutenant Wright said . " Sorry I 'm late , but I do n't mind catching up . " He took a Martini from the tray . " Make me another one , boy , " he added gently . " Maybe you better make me two . This is really a nice place you 've got here , Mr. Winter-tree . " He drank his Martini quickly . The conversation had died . There was a silence while Lieutenant Wright picked up another Martini . The Admiral cleared his throat . " I hear you 're off the Great Lick , " the Admiral said . Lieutenant Wright laughed loudly , although there appeared to be no reason for his laughing . " Yes , sir , the old Lick and promise . That 's what the kids call her , Admiral , sir , " Lieutenant Wright answered . " And she 's mostly Lick . " Lieutenant Wright laughed again . " She really is , sir . She really took them aboard , sir , but we knocked off one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rotch . " How many did you say she took ? " " Three of them , sir , " the Captain said . " She really took them , " Lieutenant Wright laughed again . " Oh boy ! She really took them . " The Admiral glanced at Mr. Huntley and then at Mr. Wintertree . He seemed to feel that the occasion compelled him to say something but not too much . " Occasionally , " he said , " in the course of an air battle a Japanese plane crashes on the deck or superstructure of one of our ships  --  a suicide plane . It naturally causes considerable damage . " Lieutenant Wright whistled . He was on his third Martini and , as far as Mr. Huntley could see , rank did not disturb him . " Did you say damage , sir ? " he asked . The wrinkles deepened on the Admiral 's forehead . " Just one minute , please , " he began , but the Lieutenant raised his voice . " It 's really rugged when one of them comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now this first that hit us it was about eighteen hundred and thirty hours  --  he came in from the port side . We gave him everything we had . You could see the 40 's going into him like red-hot rivets . " " Just a minute , " the Admiral said . " Just a minute , son , " but the Lieutenant 's voice was louder . " That kid must have been dead , but he still kept coming in . You got the idea there was nothing you could do but stand and take it . It was a very rugged feeling . " " Rotch , " the Admiral said to the Captain . Captain Ratch 's manner reminded Huntley of that of a kindly policeman . He rested his hand on Lieutenant Wright 's shoulder and whispered something . As he listened , the Lieutenant 's face looked blank , and his thoughts seemed to drift away from him and he was back again where he had started , right on Mr. Wintertree 's lanai . " I 'm sorry , sir , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restricted . " " That 's all right , son , " the Admiral told him . " That 's all right . " " Down in Numea we had a song about it , " the Lieutenant said . " Some of the kids made it up at the club . ' I 'm forever whispering secrets . ' " Mr. Wintertree 's voice interrupted . " I think luncheon is ready now , " Mr. Wintertree was saying . " Well , let 's skip it , " Lieutenant Wright said . " As long as pop here says luncheon 's ready . " " If you 'll just lead the way , Admiral , " Mr. Wintertree said . 7N THE dining room a narrow dark table .11. was set for lunch . There was a center decoration of breadfruit and green leaves . There were Chinese plates and small wooden bowls filled with a gray paste-like substance that Mr. Huntley knew was a native food called poi . The Admiral was at Mr. Wintertree 's right , Mr. Huntley at his left . Captain Rotch was beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm forever whispering secrets , " the Lieutenant was singing beneath his breath . He lifted up his plate very carefully and set it down . Then Mr. Huntley saw him staring at his bowl of poi . The servants were passing plates of clear consomme . " I 'm sorry there is n't a sixth to balance the table , " Mr. Wintertree said . " This is Mrs. Wintertree 's day at the Red Cross . I see you looking at the table , Admiral . Da you know what wood it 's made from ? " " Yes , " the Admiral said , " Koa wood . " " No , no , " Mr. Wintertree said . " It 's made from the monkey pod tree . " " Have they got monkeys on this rock ? " the Lieutenant asked . Mr. Wintertree went on without anMAGAZINE. swering . " Now , the chairs we are sitting on arc kaa . They are our best wood , very close to mahogany . The koa is a very handsome tree , Mr. Huntley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mountains , but our most beautiful wood came from the kou tree . " " I never heard of the kou tree , " the Admiral said . " As long as it is n't the cuckoo tree , " Lieutenant Wright said and he began to laugh . " The old calabashes were all made from the kou , " Mr. Wintertree said . " You can see one of them  --  a very handsome one  --  on the sideboard , but the kou is nearly extinct . When ants appeared on the island , they ate the kou . " " What did they want to eat it for , pop ? " Lieutenant Wright asked . " They ate the leaves , " Mr. Wintertree answered . " Well , bugs do eat the damnedest things on islands , " Lieutenant Wright said . " At Hollandia something ate the seat right out of my pants . Maybe it was ants . Ants in my pants , pop . " " Mr. Wintertree , " the Admiral asked . " Do you know the Hawaiian word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mr. Wintertree . " Poopooki . " " I suppose you know how the word was derived ? " the Admiral asked . The soup was finished . Mr. Winter-tree glanced at the servants and they began to take away the plates . " Oh yes , " he said . " Of course I know . " But the Admiral went on telling him . " Well , Huntley ought to hear it , " the Admiral said . " Mr. Huntley can write it down sometime . It seems that there did n't use to be any cats in the Hawaiian Islands . " " No cats , no ants , " Lieutenant Wright said . The Admiral glanced at him sideways . " And no Naval Reserve officers , " the Admiral said . " It seems the missionaries brought the cats . " Lieutenant Wright smiled . " And the Navy brought in the Reserve officers , Admiral , sir . They had to , to win this war . " Captain Rotch cleared his throat " Perhaps the Admiral would like to finish what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , " Lieutenant Wright said quickly . " Aye , aye , sir . The Missionaries brought the cats .. . . " " You see , none of the Kanakas had ever seen a cat . They did n't have a name for it , " the Admiral went on . Mr. Huntley saw that Mr. Wintertree winced when the Admiral used the word " Kanaka . " " Then they must have heard one of the white missionary women call her cat ' poor pussy ' and that 's how you get it  --  poor pussy  --  poopooki . " " By God , what do you know , " the Lieutenant said , and he whistled . " You come to an island and it 's like every other island , and all the native Joes and Marys are just alike . Coral , palm trees , a lagoon , and then out come the canoes  --  and there you are , like that . " He snapped his fingers . " Pretty soon you beat a drum and start singing . " ? You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seemed to Mr. Huntley that Mr. Wintertree 's voice was sharp . " I think you 'll find it different . These fish are mullet . The old kings used to keep them in the royal fish ponds . " " There 's nothing better than good mullet , " Captain Rotch said . " Back out there , " the Lieutenant waved his hand to illustrate back out there , " we used to chuck a stick of dynamite in a lagoon and get mullet , and did the natives go for those fish ? You ought to have seen them go for them . Once when I was out with a sub over in the Zulu Sea  --  all right , Admiral , sir , security . " " I 'm sorry we ca n't hear about it , " the Admiral said . " This is one-finger poi , " Mr. Winter-tree told the table . " There 's a shortage of good poi , like everything else , but some of my native friends help inc . " Mr. Wintertree stopped , because Lieutenant Wright had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , they tell a story about me out there , pop , " the Lieutenant said , and he waved his hand again , to illustrate out there , " and I guess I can tell it to you without breaking security . It 's rather a funny story . " He laughed again as heremembered it and pushed his plate away . " One of the CPO 's who was working with me came up to me one day and he said , Lieutenant , sir , I ought to get a little leave . This country here is getting me queer . ' Well , I did n't blame him . So I just told him to relax and tell me what was the matter . And he said : ' It 's this way , sir . All these dark women begin to look to me as though they were white . ' And do you know what I said to him ? At least , it 's what they say.I said to him . " The Lieutenant paused and beamed at everyone . " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " The Admiral smiled . Mr. Huntley laughed , although he had heard the story several times before . " We are having papaya for dessert , " . Mr. Wintertree said . " It is n't quite the season , but I 'm proud of my papayas . " They had small cups of very black coffee out on the lanai . Mr. Wintertree explained that it was Kona coffee , so named because it was grown on the slopes of the Kona coast on the big island of Hawaii . That was an island too big to be spoiled , Mr. Wintertree said . The ghosts of the past still lingered over the Kona coast . You could still see the old burial caves in the cliffs that fringe the bay where Captain Cook was killed . You could still see the black walls of lava rock that marked the compounds of the native villages . iv . MR . HUNTLEY sat listening , he was thinking of the irrational chances that threw people together . In a few moments this party on the lanai would be breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Huntley would return to his hotel . He wondered what the Lieutenant would find to do . Very little , he imagined , now that Honolulu was a garrison town . " They still sing the old metes on Hawaii , " Mr. Wintertree was saying . " Those old word-of-mouth songs have been passed on for centuries . " The Lieutenant looked at his small cup of coffee . " Would it he out of order to turn this in for something else ? " he asked . " Turn it in ? " Mr. Wintertree repeated . " For a Scotch and soda , " the Lieuten-VIRGIN FORESTS IN 1850 ? are now planning sixty years ahead ? ) Consequently , farmers cut trees lavishly for houses , barns , fuel , rail fences , or just to clear the land . Lumbermen cut equally lavishly , often clearing away every tree so that today some 77 million acres of once-rich woodland are ruined and produce virtually no second growth .

Always there was more and often better timber to be had a little further on . Many people believed  --  and still believe  --  that our forests were so . vast that there was no need for worry or to mend our destructive methods of cutting . Even today some lumbermen like to point out that we deplete only about two per cent of our standing raw timber for lumber every year . They forget that the drain is almost as much more in the cut for pulp , fuel , and other uses ; that there are further heavy losses from fire , insects , and storms ; and that much of our remaining timber can not be reached at reasonable cost . And our fine virgin timber is being cut HE GREAT westward migration after the Civil War , with its accompanying railway construction and building of new cities , created an immense demand for lumber . This in turn led to the growth of big lumber companies , which assembled large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be cut and milled in volume . Then began the era of big profits . Frequently timber was purchased on the stump for as little as 10 or 15 cents a thousand board feet , with the land included ; later much of it  --  especially the long-leaf pine of the South  --  was sold for $12 to $15 a thousand , still on the stump . After it was cut again at a good profit ? much of the cleared land could still be sold to farmers for several dollars an acre . There were , of course , neither laws nor business codes to provide for reforestation . Nobody ever thought of such a thing , except a few people who had traveled in Europe , and they were generally regarded as crackpots . Even the government did not get around to organizing a Division of Forestry in the Agriculture Department until 1898 . In 1905 it was expanded into the Forest Service  --  with eleven employees and a budget of $28,000 . Four years later the lumber industry reached the        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
