THERE is NO USE arguing any longer about whether we ought to prepare for peace in time of war . We had scarcely begun to fight in the European theatre before questions as to the organiza ? tion of future peace began to bedevil us . To the extent that we are unprepared to answer them correctly , we endanger victory as well as the Atlantic Charter . In North Africa we were confronted at once with Admiral Darlan and all that he implies , together with the op ? ponents of Admiral Darlan and all that they imply . The expectations of the French and other conquered populations upon whom we must rely will be influ ? enced by the way we handle that issue . And the battle for Tunisia automatically gave the signal for intensi ? fied political warfare in Italy . The Italian people have been promised immunity from air bombing if they will overthrow Mussolini . But that is merely a beginning . ' What sort of government may the Italians expect if they act as we wish ? Already there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savoy and those who want an Italian republic . What terms are we prepared to make with a revolutionary Italy ? What about boundaries and colonies ? These are not academic questions ; decisions about them may have to be made while our armies move . It will not do to say that our acts are dictated purely by military necessity , that we are so concentrated on winning the war that all questions about the peace must be postponed until it is won . This is not that kind of war . If we go on making decision after decision on the basis of military necessity , we may find that we have lost the war . Even if we win it , the peace will have been predetermined by the series of decisions we have been making while trying to ignore the post-war con ? sequences of what we do . France and Italy are but the first samples . There will be Albania , Yugoslavia , Austria , Belgium , Hol ? land , perhaps Spain . There will be Poland , Czecho ? Slovakia , Hungary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bit by bit , the problems of a new Europe will come tumbling into our lap . Only the most reckless of statesmanship would confront this prospect with nothing but an intention to make a long series of ad-hoedecisions , without any guiding principles , and without any announcement of policy that can keep the sim ? mering pot from boiling over . It would be possible to attack this confused problem by the old techniques of intrigue . Back-door diplomacy , acting shrewdly in the welter of influence and pressure , could buy this group with promises , put off that group with duplicity , and produce in the end a jerry-built political structure that might be maintained for a while by the force of our arms and the need for our food , but in the end would surely collapse in wars and civil violence . This would be worse even than an unrelated series of decisions taken in the field by force of circum ? stances and made permanent by inadvertence . Suppose , for instance , that those in authority should decide that it was best , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the countries concerned during the reconstruction period , that we should install in France a government headed by Darlan , in Italy the House of Savoy , in Austria Otto of Hapsburg , and so on through the list . Democrats , both within and with ? out these countries , would of course be outraged . But that attitude fails to perceive the worst of the conse ? consequences involved . It may be truly answered that it is not our business in this war to force a democratic re ? public upon every nation , whether or not its people wants democracy or is prepared to exercise it . If even Britain , Norway and Sweden feel the usefulness of a royal symbol , some link with legitimacy might be advised for nations less advanced politically . Far more weighty are three other objections . First , whatever form of government we might choose , and no matter how wise our choice , we should have been doing the choosing for a people which is now unable to express its own will . That is a basic contradiction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpopular and might easily contribute to the downfall of the government we selected . If the British and American governments are afraid of post-war Communist revolution in Europe , I can think of no better recipe to facilitate it . Second , having picked out an authorized government for each nation concerned , we should during the process have had to rule on the demarcations between them ? in other words , we should in camera have decided the immensely ticklish ques ? tions of boundaries and sovereignty . If anything is more likely to cause a renewal of European struggle in the future , I can not think of it . Third , in our nego ? tiations with the governments which we selected and backed , we should have been unable to avoid commit ? ments prejudicial to a future international world order ? commitments about colonies , trade , monetary sys ? tems and all the rest of it . Thus we should destroy Whatever hope remained of enduring peace . In " The Lessons of Last Time " ( The New Repub ? lic , February 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing such difficulties which still seems to me worth con ? consideration . First , before any new government is set up or recognized in any of the liberated regions , the United Nations ( I then said Britain , the United States and the Soviet Union ) should formulate and announce general principles to govern all such cases . First and most important of these would be that , pending the establishment of an international organization deriving its powers from the consent of the governed , the United Nations would , in all liberated regions , act as trustees for it . This would involve the reservation and temporary exercise of all powers which it is foreseen must be reposed in some international authority if peace is to be preserved and the Atlantic Charter ful ? filled . Among such powers and duties the following would rank high : I. Determination of national boundaries . 2 . Supervision of colonies . 3 . Regulation of international trade , investment and currencies . 4 . Guarantee of civil liberties and individual demo ? cratic rights . 5 . Protection of racial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Safeguarding of minimum labor standards . 7 . Control of armament manufacture and military forces . 8 . The duty to maintain civil peace . 9 . The levying of taxes or contributions for the sup ? port of the above activities . Second , the United Nations would announce that as soon as conditions permitted , governmental authority in each region or nation , within the above framework , would be exercised by a regime chosen by the respec ? tive people concerned . For this purpose , after full and free discussiort of the subject had been assured , the in ? ternational trustees would call constitutional conven ? tions , delegates to which would be elected on the basis of free and equal suffrage , the elections being super ? vised by the trustees . In cases where the conquerors had displaced regimes which already had essentially democratic constitutions , these constitutions would be restored and general elections called to form a new government . Thus the United Nations would be de ? barred from setting up even a " government in exile " as a permanent authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . Pending the establishment of such autonomous gov ? ernments , the United Nations would take over the administration of reoccupied regions through the air pointment of civil commissions , the duty of which would be to exercise the reserved powers and prepare the way for the reestablishment of local or national authorities . Though final decision on international boundaries would not be made before a permanent international government is formed , the trustees , for the puree 's ? of promptly setting up interim governments , and to avoid controversy , would temporarily restore the bowl ' daries existing before the war . Now let us see how such a program would work in a few specific cases . First , the decision what to do with political power in North Africa would not reside with the United States alone , and there would be no poi bility of controversy about it between the United States and Britain . The United Nations would say to Darlaer the de Gaullists and other Frenchmen alike : we can not decide among you . That is the right of the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no pry " ises about colonies or the empire ; they will come under international jurisdiction , even if it is decided event* , ally that French administration should be restored ' which may well be possible , with certain international guarantees . For the present , and as far as military rt% " ' quirements permit , North Africa will be administered . not by Darlan but by a civil commission representing , not the United States , not the American DepartMent of State , but the United Nations . It will be the clef , of this commission to release all political prisoners hell ' , by the Vichy regime , guarantee civil liberties and Pte ' serve civil peace . In so far as military rule is necessary because this is a theatre of war , it will be exercised by the authority of General Eisenhower as a United tit tions commander . We will not use this opportuniti strengthen any faction or aspirant to power . We should say to the Italian people ? when 7 ? 11 have overthrown Mussolini and your country has liberated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you want the House of Safeyr and good , but we will not impose it on you . If you Cant na a republic , you can have it ; but even that we shall impose . All we will do is to substitute for the authority , which will be inevitable while Italy theatre of war , a civil commission , whose duty it and be to guarantee to you civil liberties , a free Pres ! " rile domestic peace so that you can have a chance to7108 what you want without having anybody either 0 or inside Italy impose it on you DECEMBER 28 , 1 9 4 2 national government is established , they will be treated according to a general rule that is applied to all nations alike . We shall restore your pre-war national boun ? daries , just as we shall restore those of all other na ? tions ; but it is understood that in this matter we are making no permanent decisions ; boundary disputes are within the jurisdiction of the future international gov ? ernment , of which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can fight for Austria if you want to , but we have no right to say that you shall rule it . Nor can we tell you what its eventual boun ? daries will be . All we can promise is that after peace and civil rights are reestablished there , the people will decide whom or what they want , and you will have the same right to try to win their favor as the Social Demo- crats or other factions.85t Formulas like these would avoid a good many pit ? falls , but they would be insufficient if not supple ? mented by other measures in the economic field . A far more important question , for instance , than where boundaries are drawn is what they imply in the way of economic and military segmentation . It is impossible to assure peace in Europe by any set of boundaries what ? ever . On the other hand , almost any set would do , with the right type of international system and eco ? nomic arrangements . And political decisions such as these , while necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set forth in the Atlantic Charter , without active international agencies to seek those aims . It will be necessary to discuss these matters briefly in future articles .
