KIMMY A Story WILLIAM MORIARTY W E WERE coming back from the lake . We cut across old man Carson 's back field and into the woods . The field was just plowed and ran uphill and we sweated in the hot afternoon sun , walking up the furrows with our feet sinking into the soft ground . In the woods it was dark and cool . The pines smelled clean . We slid on the dead , brown pine needles as we walked . Kimmy said , " I like the woods best . " It was the first thing he had said since we left the lake . " I do too , " I said . Kimmy did n't say anything else . After a while I said , " I wish I had a horse . " I looked at Kimmy . " A big chestnut stallion , " I said . " Like the one Jakey Stein has the picture of hung up in his barbershop . " Kimrny did n't seem to be listening . He did n't answer . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Then I was quiet . We came down a slope . We slid and we turned half-sideways on the path and came down sliding on the dead , brown pine needles and digging in with the sides of our feet . On the slope the pines grew close together and off from the path in among the pines there were little patches of snow still hiding in under the rocks . It was cool and dark in there ' where the pines were thick and there was a fresh , piney , spring smell . Then the slope flattened out and it was easier walking on the flat . Unexpectedly , Kimmy said : " I would n't want a horse . " He did n't say it to me in particular , he just announced it . But I had thought that he had n't been listening to me before , so now I picked him up eagerly . " I would , " I said . " A big chestnut stall ion . " " I 'd rather have something different , " Kimmy said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd rather have a big chestnut stallion . With his mane clipped short and standing up straight and with his tail trimmed and standing out behind him and a shiny chestnut coat . A horse like that , " I said wishingly , picturing him . " Like the one Jakey Stein has the picture of hung up in his barbershop . " Kimmy did n't say anything . " It 'd be fine if we both had horses , " I suggested , looking at him . For a minute Kimmy still did n't say anything and then he said shortly , " I 'd rather have something different . " We came around a crumbling ledge of gray rock jutting out of a hillside and started up another hill . Our feet slid back on the slippery , brown pine needles and we had to go up sideways , digging in hard with the sides of our heels . We came to the top out of breath . On top the hill was bald and we were in the sun a minute , feeling the warmth through our clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went down into the cool-smelling , green dark again . " I wish I had a horse like that , " I said wistfully , still thinking about him . " I could ride him , " I said . " Through the woods , in around the trees . Days after school I could take him into town to the store and I could take him over to Hadley when they have the fair . And at night after supper , when it was still bright , I could gallop him down the road past Helen 's house . " And if we both had horses , " I said to Kimmy , becoming more eager as I talked about it , " maybe in the fall sometimes you could come down and we could go hunting on them . And we could take them over to Jess Carstairs ' . He 's got a horse . " Kimmy did n't say anything . He did n't seem to be listening . " You remember Jess Carstairs , " I said . " He 's got a horse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't interested . " She 's only a fat little mare , " I said , disappointed . We were quiet for a long time walking through the woods . Then after a while I said , " What would you rather have ? " " I do n't know , " Kimmy said . " Things . " " What kind of things ? " I said . " I do n't know , " Kimmy said . " Different things . " " Yes , " I said , " but what kind of different things ? " " Oh , just things , " Kimmy said becoming impatient . " That 's all , Things . " I did n't say anything more . CAME down out of the woods into 1/VIlagg 's back pasture . It was late spring and the young grass was coming up green and moist from the still soggy earth . As we came across the pasture the grass gave with little squishing noises under our feet . The sun had dropped low and was beginning to glow red over the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the pasture in the late afternoon sun but there was already a tang of the night coolness in the air . Flagg 's cows were out grazing at one end of the pasture . Sometimes Kimmy and I had used to chase them . I remembered and started to say something about it but then something  --  a feeling as I looked at Kimmy  --  made me change my mind and Idid n't say anything then , after all . " What ? " Kimmy said sharply . " Nothing , " I said . We skirted wide around Flagg 's house and came out onto the road at the other end of the pasture . Flagg 's dogs spotted us skirting the house and began barking . Flagg came out onto his side porch and watched us but we were too far away for him to do anything about it . We turned left when we reached the road and when we were down the road a long way we could still hear Flagg 's dogs barking behind us . We came to Kimmy 's house . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the road . The bottom windows of the front were almost hidden behind shrubbery on each side of the door and a wide gravel drive circled from the road up to the door and back to the road again . A tall hedge on the inside edge of the drive circled with it , and set off by the hedge was a smooth , close-cropped front lawn sloping up from the road with flower beds arranged in it . We stopped at the beginning of the gravel drive . We stood for a minute awkwardly without talking . I was waiting for Kimmy to say something but he just stood with his head down toeing at the gravel and did n't say anything . So then I said tentatively , " Well , so long . " " So long , " Kimmy said in an indifferent voice without lifting his head . That was all . I started out down the road . I went slowly , feeling hurt about it . But still I knew inside me that I could n't let it go like that , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Kimmy was halfway up the gravel drive . " Kimmy ! " I called . He turned around and waited with a half-frown on his face for me to come up to him . " What about tonight ? " I said . " I do n't know , " Kimmy said . He did n't seem to be interested . " There 's a carnival over in Hadley we could take in , " I offered . Kimmy just lifted one shoulder in a half-shrug . " I do n't know , " he said . " I do n't think I feel much like going to a carnival . " " Come on , " I said . Kimmy did n't say anything . " Come on , " I said again . " What do you say ? We 'll have some fun . " Kimmy did n't say anything . He just stood there with a frown . I felt bad about it . " You always used to like carnivals , " I said accusingly . " I just do n't feel like going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said sharply , getting impatient . I did n't say anything and for a minute we just stood there . Then I offered , " Well , we do n't have to go to the carnival . We could go in town to the movies . Or we could just hang around . " Kimmy just lifted his shoulder in that shrug again . " I do n't know , " he said without looking at me . There did n't seem to be anything else to say after that and I just stood there with him in the gravel drive without saying anything . " Well , " I said at last . " So long . " " So long , " Kimmy said . He still did n't look at me . I started out down the gravel drive . But T had just reached the end when he called me . I turned around . He was standing there with a doubtful look on his face . " I 'll come over after you , " he said . I grinned . I walked home down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is and I had always been friends . Every summer we played together . It was only in the summers that he came down . Every year toward the end of May or the first of June he would come down with his father and mother to the big white house up the road . Then we would play together all summer . He would come over in the mornings and help me with my chores and he 'd eat at my house with me . And sometimes his mother would let him stay over the night and we 'd sleep together in the big bed in my room . We 'd stay awake half the night talking in bed and in the morning when my mother called us we would n't want to get up and she 'd have to come up and chase us down to breakfast . We used to go fishing together in the lake and we had secret hiding places in the woods . We dug a cave at the bottom of a hillside and we made a clearing out front . When we 'd come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can remember the smell of the fish frying and the thin , bluish smoke rising up above the tops of the trees against the clear sky ; the bright , still warmth of the summer sun in our clearing and the dark , cool green of the woods all around ; the silence , except for the sound of bird calls or of a woodpecker at work somewhere in the distance ; and the sense of peace and remoteness , cut off from all the world with Kimmy , as we 'd sit cross-legged in the shade in front of our cave , eating our fish with our fingers and playing seriously that we were Indian scouts . We 'd follow trails through the woods , walking stealthily and trying to keep twigs from cracking under our feet , coming suddenly on a startled chipmunk in an opening and stopping to watch birds building their nests . Deep in the woods there was a cold , fast-running little stream with white birches lining its edges that we used to wade along  --  seeing darting trout in the deeper shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail . And at the end of the woods we 'd climb trees . From the top limbs of the trees , far away we could see the town and we could just make out my house and Kimmy 's with the road passing by them . The fields would seem small and rectangular lying out in the afternoon sun . And as we 'd watch , we 'd see someone we knew out hoeing or plowing : stopping , taking off his hat , wiping the sweat from his forehead with the sleeve of his forearm , looking around , surveying what work he had done and what he still had to do  --  his dog frisking and barking , the sounds coming to us faintly after a minute  --  putting on his hat and beginning to work again . We 'd watch him silently from the trees and sometimes we 'd call out , " Halloo-oo-oo ! " the sound echoing across the still , sunny fields . He 'd stop and look around  --  his dog , head up alertly , sniffing at the air . We 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees and making signs to each other . Until finally he 'd give it up and begin work again . In a few minutes we 'd call out again , watching him stop and look around in puzzlement , his dog stopping playing and sniffing even more intently at the-air . We 'd do it a few times more and then after a while we 'd drop with careful silence down through the limbs of the trees and retrace our steps through the woods , not talking until we were far away and then laughing , pleased that he did n't know who it was and feeling like mysterious scouts or spies . For rainy days we had the loft in my barn . We 'd lie up there , half-hidden in the loose , good-smelling hay with the dull sound of the rain pattering on the roof and we 'd talk . About what we were going to do the next day or about the different people around and what we thought were their queer habits and characters . Or we 'd talk about things we wanted and plan out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And sometimes we 'd talk , wisely and philosophically , about what we were going to be and what we were going to do when we grew up . I remember telling Kimmy one rainy afternoon as we were lying in the hay in the loft : " I 'll have a farm and marry Helen . And you can come down and stay with us , and we can go hunting and fishing and we 'll both have horses . We can ride them up to Bear Mountain , and take our tents with us , and we can stay up there and camp . And at night , at the end of the week , we can ride our horses into town , with everybody looking at us , and tie up at Jamieson 's . And then . . . " I had to stop . I was puzzled about what two grown-up men would do in town on a Saturday night and I had to think about it . " And then we can do anything else we want to ! " I summed up triumphantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtfully . " Except that instead of coming down to stay with you , I 'll have the farm next to yours . Only it wo n't really be a farm . I 'll just have pasture land and keep horses and be a gentleman farmer . " As we talked , the thought of it became too interesting and too exciting for me to keep on lying down . I sat up . " That 'd be good , " I said . " And in the winter we can go skating . And maybe we can even go to the World Series . And at night we can have parties , with a real orchestra and dancing , and cider and punch and anything else we want . " But suddenly Kimmy did n't seem to be listening . He seemed to be thinking about something to himself . " That 'd be good , " I said to arouse him . " I do n't know , " Kimmy said with a pout . " What ? " I said . I looked at him with a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kimmy did n't say anything and then he said : " I want to marry Helen . " I had to think about it . Kimmy was looking at me with a kind of stubborn , pouting seriousness . " Well , you can have Helen then , " said , magnanimously giving her to him , " and I can come over and visit you . And we can have the parties at your house instead of mine and . . . " We were happy again . We went on the rest of the afternoon lying in the hay-loft and blithely planning out what we would do with our futures . G oma home down the road I thought about it . I forgot how Kimmy had been today at the lake  --  he had seemed different somehow , more grown up , almost as if he were a stranger  --  but I forgot about that and remembered the good times we had used to have together and I planned out good times we were going to have this summer . Kimmy had just come down now for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I whistled cheerfully , kicking at pebbles , all the way home . We had supper late . , My father had finished and gone over to Tom Mason 's but I was still at the table finishing when Kimmy came over . He came around to the side of the house and waited for me . My mother saw him through the kitchen window , standing there on the lawn at the side of the house in the growing dark . " It 's Kimmy ! " she said with pleased surprise and went to the kitchen door . " Well , come in ! " she called to him , holding open the screen door . " Come in ! " Kimmy came up the three steps , across the side porch , and into the kitchen , my mother letting the screen door close behind him . I watched him expectantly from where I was sitting at the kitchen table finishing my supper . " Well , and ai n't you the stranger ! " my mother said , pleased to see him . My mother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-natured gruffness with just the faintest trace of a brogue . " And since when are you needing an invitation to come in ? " she said . Kimmy flushed embarrassedly . " My , let me look at you , " my mother said going on and not seeming to notice . She took Kimmy by the arm and turned him around in a circle in front of her as you might a small child . She stepped back laughing and shaking her head . " It 's really a man you 've grown up to be , " she said joshing him , but with a twinkle of pleasure and pride . Kimmy seemed still more embarrassed and ill at ease . But my mother pushed him toward the kitchen table and then bustled to pull out a chair for him . " Sit down now , " she commanded . " Sit down and have a piece of my apple pie with Bill . " Kimmy hesitated for a moment . " Well , no thank you , Mrs. Clark , " he said . " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of for a dish for him . She stopped now and looked at him . " It 's a polite rascal you 've grown up to be , " she said , shaking her head and trying to seem still pleased . But she looked disappointed . " Well , just a small piece then , " Kimmy said . My mother brightened immediately . " Ah , that 's more like yourself , " she said , laughing . " There 's nobody could tell me Ernest Kimball could n't find room in his belly for a piece of my apple pie . " We sat at the kitchen table and ate our pie . My mother cut Kimmy a piece a quarter of the pie and she sat at the table with us , talking to us while we ate . She asked Kimmy questions and went on without waiting for him to answer them , laughing at him and joshing him and urging the apple pie on him . But Kimmy was only embarrassed and it was obvious he had to force the pie down . It seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Kimmy eating my mother 's apple pie , with her sitting with us talking and laughing , joshing us in her good-natured , gruff way and urging us toeat . It seemed familiar and yet somehow there was an unfamiliarity to it . It was like doing a familiar thing in a dream . The thing is familiar and yet there is a strangeness about it so that it seems forced and unreal . I felt a kind of unease . All the happiness I had felt bubbling inside me coming home down the road and waiting for Kimmy to come over seemed to drain away coldly and I began to feel bitter . Kimmy seemed embarrassed and I wished my mother would stop talking . I was ashamed of her for it somehow , and even though I felt ashamed of myself for feeling ashamed , I could n't help it . The kitchen. , which had always seemed to me large and bright and familiar , seemed suddenly shabby . There were cracks in the ceiling and the floor , though scrubbed clean , was uneven . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tablecloth was worn and frayed . I kept looking up at Kimmy and wishing my mother would stop talking . I could n't help thinking of Kimmy 's mother . She was young-looking and reserved and always dressed up . She spoke in a Iow voice and although she was pleasant I was always kind of embarrassed in front of her . That she was Kimmy 's mother I had always known , but somehow I had never before related her to him . She had never seemed like his mother in the same way that my mother seemed like mine , and I do n't think I had ever truly realized in that sense that she was actually Kimmy 's mother . My mother had always seemed to me more like his mother than his own . And she was just the low-spoken , elegant stranger who lived in the big , white house during the summers . But now .. . But then suddenly I became ashamed and then angry with myself for the way I was comparing our mothers together and I tried to force myself from doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Kimmy and I would sit in the kitchen listening to my mother talk while she worked around . She was always full of stories and she liked Kimmy and she was always feeding him her apple pie . So that sometimes I 'd get jealous . But my mother could tell by the sulkiness on my face and she 'd laugh at me and josh me and make over me and everything would be all right again . And sometimes she 'd scold Kimmy and he 'd talk back to her in fooling . Then she 'd threaten to thrash him and she 'd chase him laughing out of the house and she 'd stand in the door and shake her fist at him trying to pretend that she was angry . But then she 'd have to laugh and he 'd come back in again laughing and ducking as she 'd take a swipe at him in fooling . I remembered those things sitting at the kitchen table , with my mother talking away and Kimmy , embarrassed and polite , trying to force down his pie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we better get going . " /t DID N'T have a very good time at he carnival . We went through all the motions but we did n't have a good time . I had always liked carnivals and I had always had a good time . But this carnival somehow seemed too crowded . It seemed cheap and tawdry and too noisy . It was dusty and the air smelled bad with the smell of hot dogs and hamburgers and onions and popcorn . The lights were too glaring and the games and rides did n't seem any fun . We left early . We came up the road in the dark not talking . I 'd say something and Kimmy would answer and then there was n't anything else to say . Then , after a while , I 'd say something again . But we did n't have anything to talk about . We stopped when we came to Kimmy 's house . We stood out front a minute . " Well , I think I 'll go in , " Kimmy said . Then after a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bill . " But there was a dumb hurt that had been welling up inside me ever since he had come over after supper . It would n't let me let it go at that . " It 's early yet , " I said now vindictively , saying it just to be stubborn . " Let 's lie down on the grass . " " It 's too cool , " Kimmy said . " I think I 'll go in to bed . " But I lay down on the grass . " It 's early yet , " I said . " You 'll catch cold , " Kimmy said . " I do n't care . " Kimmy watched me a minute . " Well , good night , " he said . " I 'm going to bed . " " So long , " I said . But he did n't go in . " You had better get up and go home , " he said after another minute , " You 're only going to catch cold there . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the stars , " I said . " It 's going to be hot tomorrow and clear . How about going fishing ? " Kimmy did n't answer . I turned my head to look at him , half-mocking . Then he said , " I do n't think I 'd care to go fishing . " " You used to care . " " Well , / do n't any more , " he said , his voice finally beginning to get sharp . " There are a lot of things you do n't care about any more , " I said . Kimmy did n't say anything . " Look at the beautiful stars , " I said . " Oh , go to hell ! " Kimmy said . He was angry . " Go ahead and stay there . I 'm going to bed . " " Go ahead , " I said . The hurt deep inside me seemed to be enjoying itself . It made me want to hurt Kimmy or at least stir his anger more . " Do n't let me bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He started to go and then did n't . He stood watching me . " Look , Bill , " he said , trying to sound reasonable , " you 're just going to catch cold lying there in the grass . " " I do n't care , " I said . We did n't say anything for a while . At last Kimmy said , " For Christ 's sake will you go home ! " " No , " I said sweetly . I felt a sharp , jittery feeling grow inside me as he became more angry . It seemed to have a perversely joyous edge . A feeling you get when your pride makes you deliberately spoil something you love . But then , this was spoiled already . " It 's a beautiful night , " I said . Kimmy walked away but when he had gone a few steps up the drive he turned around and came back again . " Look , Bill , you 're going to catch cold lying there in that damp grass . " " That 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Go ahead to bed . Is n't it beauti-ful here under the stars and the sky ? " Kimmy swore under his breath and dived at me . I rolled over sharply and he landed on the ground . We wrestled . We acted as if it were in fun but we were trying hard to hurt each other . A car came up the road . Its lights flickered over us and we stopped . The car went past down the road and we lay there a while in the dark without saying anything , nursing our bruises . Then , after a while , I got up . " Well , so long , " I said . Kimmy did n't say anything . After a minute I started out down the road . " So long , Bill , " Kimmy said from the darkness behind me . That was the end of it . I knew it walking home down the road in the dark . It had n't been anything , and it was everything . I did n't understand it and I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the end of it and I felt bad . FTER that sometimes I 'd see Kimmy . Some summers he 'd come down and bring his friends with him , although other summers he would n't come down at all , I 'd meet him in town , perhaps on the post office steps , and he 'd go out of his way to speak to me . We 'd speak for a few minutes , with his friends standing to one side waiting for him . He 'd ask about my mother and what I was doing but I 'd just feel awkward standing there in my overalls and knowing that his friends were looking at us . And then there was a strange embarrassment meeting him and talking to him like that , asking polite questions and answering them . It was like talking to a stranger who knew all your intimate secrets . I 'd think about our cave in the woods and the talks we had used to have in the hay-loft on rainy days , So that now , standing there talking to himself-consciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he 'd excuse himself and join them again . Other times when I 'd be walking down the road I might see him . He 'd come flashing by in a bright roadster with his friends in it . He 'd wave and I 'd wave back and then he was gone down the road . But that night was the end of it . I knew it walking home down the road in the dark . Return W. W.
