" The first step in describing silence , " says California-born Composer John Cage , " is to use silence itself . Matter of fact , I thought of composing a piece like that . It would be very beautiful , and I would offer it to Muzak . . . " <P> Muzak 's piped-in music programs had no spot for a composition in dead silence . But last week , hardy Manhattan concertgoers made a spot for Composer Cage 's rhythmic , percussive " sounds &; silence " music . At Carnegie Recital Hall for two nights in a row , Pianist Maro Ajemian thudded , clanked , bonged and chimed through 16 sonatas and four interludes on a " prepared " piano outfitted with bolts , screws , pieces of rubber and plastic stuck inside to short-circuit the tones . ( After the first night , someone unCaged the piano , and the composer himself took three hours getting all the gadgets back into position . ) <P> After Carnegie , balletomanes at City Center heard what a Caged orchestra sounded like . His music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grunting fragments of brass and woodwinds , but Composer Cage proved he could write a melody , too , when he wants to . And to his fans , Cage 's two-finger piano solo , surrounded by silence in mid-ballet , was almost a showstopper . <P> Crop-haired Composer Cage , who looks like a Huck Finn grown to 36 , is trying to compose music that is really " atonal . " Says he : " Atonal music was excellent in theory , but there were no atonal instruments to play it . " He wanted " sounds " instead of " tones " ; he found them in junk yards , bone yards and hardware stores-brake drums , pipe lengths , asses ' jaws-and in his prepared pianos . <P> After 13 years of experimenting , Cage has managed to weld together ten works ( Construction in Metal , Second Construction , etc. ) for pipe-length , brake-drum orchestras , and , with six different " preparations , " nine major works for piano . Necessarily expressionistic , one of his sonatas last week moved the New York Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes : " The fourteenth sonata . . . suggested burro 's hoofs on far-off cobbles , while a gentle church bell sounded sadly in the distance . " <P> Cage 's sounds are slowly catching on with concert performers , two or three of whom have already learned how to jimmy bolts and screws among the strings of their own pianos . Most music lovers are still doubtful . Explains Cage : " People want the newest thing in their houses and automobiles , but in the arts the newest thing seems to be too frightening .
