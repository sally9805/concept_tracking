The U.S. fashion business went Good Neighborly last week . Sponsored by the wife of Mexico 's Foreign Minister Ezequiel Padilla , a benefit style show and sale opened in Mexico City . From Dallas came a special plane bearing dresses , shoes , hats , Clothier H. Stanley Marcus and twelve luscious models . All were installed in Mexico City 's gaudy Reforma Hotel . <P> First the models gave a private showing to Seora de Avila Camacho , wife of Mexico 's President . Then the doors were thrown open to the public . Dresses were priced from $50 to $350 , hats from $40 . Well-tailored women swooped on the Reforma like seagulls on a herring run . Following the model parade , there was a wild rush to the display room . After three hours of plucking , fitting and haggling , more than one-third of the 15,000 pounds of stock had been sold . <P> The models were also overwhelmed by Good Neighborly males . The Government took them on a tour of the city . And somewhere-between the hotel , the bullfight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls received marriage proposals . All refused . <P> By week 's end the much-mauled mannequins had made a rallying cry of the title of one of the dress designs : Esta noche no ( Not tonight ) .
