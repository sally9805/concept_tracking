As the 3,200 members of the National Association of Manufacturers trooped into Manhattan 's Waldorf-Astoria hotel last week , the passwords were War &; Reconversion . But as they sat down to breakfast , the first meeting of their 49th annual convention , they were told , in no uncertain terms , that the only job of U.S. industry now is war , not peace . <P> They heard this straight from the mouth of Lieut . General Brehon B. Somervell , hard-bitten boss of the Army Service Forces , who gravely noted that current production of munitions is lagging behind consumption ( see U.S. AT WAR ) . There was worse to come . Said he : " Within the past 90 days we have had to increase our estimate of the production ... to fight Japan after Germany is defeated . . . . It will cost us $71 billion a year . " This was the first official word to U.S. business that the cutbacks in war production after V-E day have shrunk from the 40% which WPB once promised to a slim 15-20% . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the costs of ending the German war , contract terminations , etc . ) <P> Then Peace . In some confusion , the NAMsters hastily affirmed their full support to the war . Then the ponderous convention machinery , which had been geared up to reconversion long before the talk of new production kinks arose , rolled on into the postwar world . <P> Out came the flood of speeches ( 84 in all ) and the confident prediction of N.A.M . itself , based on its survey of 2,000 industries engaged in reconversion planning along with their war work , that the jobs of reconversion and postwar employment are less fearsome , the closer they come . N.A.M . predicted that : 1 ) 95% of all U.S. industry could complete reconversion within eight weeks ; 2 ) 76% of the manufacturers could reach peak production in that time ; 3 ) postwar employment in manufacturing would be 30% higher than it was in 1939 . <P> Wishful Thinking . It remained for N.A.M . ' s retiring president , Robert M. Gaylord , to strip some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some hard , grey facts . He turned a fishy eye on guessers of postwar national income . Said he : " In 1929 , 48,000,000 people worked a little more than 48 hours a week ( 2,304 million hours a week in all ) and . . . produced a national income of $83,000,000 . " Now , there are predictions that 60,000,000 people working 40 hours a week can produce $200 billions a year , " that 2,400 million hours a week , or only 4% more than we worked in 1929 , can produce 240% more national income . Let 's think straight . If they are real dollars we shall have to buy and build production facilities far more efficient than we now have . This will take time , thrift , investment and hard work . High income will not be realized by wishful thinking . "
