Harvard had a brand-new $250,000 chair in anything-at-all on one brand-new condition : a woman had to sit in it . The gift , with string attached , came from United Fruit Co. ' s President Samuel Zemurray , no Harvardman himself . A committee of Harvard professors , representing departments from fine arts to physics , solemnly scoured all available corridors of learning for a suitable candidate . They finally found her in England : Dr. Helen Maud Cam , 62 , a tweedy , vigorous history don at Cambridge ( her specialty : medieval local government ) . She would be the first woman professor of arts &; sciences in Harvard 's 312 years . <P> Until she was 19 , Helen Maud never went to school ; her father , a parson and schoolmaster , tutored her at home . She learned enough to win a scholarship at the University of London , has been leading a serenely academic life ever since . <P> Dr. Cam 's home is in Oxford , but in term she lives at Girton College , Cambridge . Her day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tea at 6 a.m . Three times a week Dr. Cam cycles to a lecture hall , her steel-grey hair and black academic gown billowing in the breeze . She has been to the U.S. only once , to teach at Pennsylvania 's Bryn Mawr , and that was 39 years ago . Most of her days are spent in tutoring , writing , helping edit the Cambridge Historical Journal , keeping the university archives , and campaigning energetically for the Labor Party . Social life ? Says Spinster Cam : " I do n't have any . Too busy . "
