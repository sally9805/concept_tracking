txt War Insurance a Safe Bet Robert S. Schloss , in a letter to THE NEW YORK TIMES on Jan. 28 , urged that the premiums paid to the Government by property owners for war-damage insurance be refunded , since no damage has occurred . The property owners made a bet with the Government ( which is to say , all the other citizens of the United States ) at long odds . They did not have to make the bet . Thus far these property owners have lost , there having been no destruction , for which we all are grateful . If there had been war damage the Government would have paid ; it stood , and still stands , the risk of substantial loss . If Mr. Schloss bet on a horse and the horse lost , would he ask to have his stake returned ? WILLIAM T. NEDLOG . Washington , Jan. 31 , 1944.
