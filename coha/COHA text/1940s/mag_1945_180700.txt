Ever since the first batch of Canadian Zombies ( home-defense draftees ) was ordered overseas at year 's end , Canada had waited to see how they would perform as fighters . Last week the first definite word came that Zombies were in combat - and the news was good . <P> Exactly how many Zombies were already in action was not yet known . But it was known that some were attached to the Algonquin Regiment . And when the Regiment was given the job of taking the German village of Veen , the Zombies got their chance . They had to advance over flat farmland , then subdue the German defenders house by house , barn by barn , pigsty by pigsty . It took three days , and one reporter called the battle " a double-header dose of hell . " Even after the village was taken , it had to be combed for mines , for it was nastily booby-trapped . One Canadian was blown up when he pulled a sheet off a farmhouse bed to spread over a dead comrade . Said one officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barn . " <P> Toronto Starman Frederick Griffin reported that " a more terrible baptism of fire no new troops ever took , or took more splendidly . " The Algonquin 's commander said : " They were just as good as any reinforcements we have had . " * <P> * In Ottawa last week , the Department of National Defense announced that more &; more " thirty-niners " - soldiers who have been overseas five years or longer-will be permitted to come home on leave . Chief reasons : the " highly satisfactory " reinforcements situation , lower-than-expected casualties .
