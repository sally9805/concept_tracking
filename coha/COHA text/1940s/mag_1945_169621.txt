The President , spokesman for the U.S. people , this week made a speech that touched about the sorest U.S. problem-strikes in industry . He offered no new method of solution , but what he said made plain sense to most U.S. citizens . At the American Legion County Fair in rural Caruthersville , Mo. , the President said : <P> " We must all get in and push . That does n't require anything in the world but plain understanding among ourselves . . . cooperation of management and labor and the farmers and every storekeeper , and every man who has an interest in the Government of the United States . " <P> The homily hit home ; such thoughts were already in the minds of most of the U.S. people . By this week the average , long-suffering U.S. citizen had begun to grow impatient with labor-management strife and the threat of more . He had good cause : he was caught in the middle and he was getting hurt . <P> He felt that both labor and ownership , in industries and services which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the interest of all the U.S. at feast as high as their own interests . He hoped , without much confidence , that labor disputants could be made to realize their responsibility to the public . <P> To world problems Harry Truman applied the good-neighborly gospel : " Do by your neighbor as you would be done by . " The nations must come to realize , he said , that the welfare of the world was more important than any individual nation 's gain . Said the President : " We are going to accept that golden rule , and we are going forward to meet our destiny , which I think Almighty God intended us to have-and we are going to be the leaders . " <P> The average U.S. citizen said Amen .
