THE menacing chug-chug of the Jap patrol boat outside came to us in greatly increased volume . We realized that probably there was a whole string of boats out there . " I do n't care if they 're the papa and mamma patrol boats and all the little patrol boats , they can only come at us one at a time , and if we throw enough stuff at ' em , they might stall for time and send for destroyer help , " Steele said . " Then at high tide we can slip along the shore and skin out through the whole works . " I placed the men along the beach in firing position . Finally we could make out the Japs with our night glasses . They had turned around and , heading out of the bay , disappeared to the south . Either they had been after us and had been baffled by the channel  --  in which case they would be waiting for us  --  or else they were merely making a routine inspection of all the coves and did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't going to stay there another minute . All hands piled in the boat and we got going . It was n't easy to do . The boards of that old dock were rotten and full of holes . Our gear was piled up there to get it out of the way while we were working on the boat . Collecting it again was a tricky job . But we finally got squared away and pushed off with the motor throttled down to reduce the noise , and felt our way to the channel . Taylor was the only one apparently not suffering from jittery nerves , for he kept walking from one end of the boat to the other , stumbling over us and stepping on our toes . Finally I said , " For the love of Mike , Guns , what are you doing ? " " I 'm looking for my shoes . I think I dropped them through a hole in that dock , " he said . " Stop worrying about your shoes and start worrying about whether you 're going to keep on living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him . We headed out to sea , due east , away from the coast , in a gentle rain , for which we were thankful , since it cut down the visibility . I looked around at the crew that morning and realized suddenly they were n't emaciated-looking any more . Overnight , almost , it seemed they had become tough , brown , rugged and strong . Their beards had grown in the few days since we had left Corregidor and they had gained an average of five to ten pounds a man . They were as satisfactory a lot to have with you in a spot like ours as you could ask for . On the previous night when we had gone to sleep , we had laid out the results of our carpentry in the boat , to be ready for us when we woke up . Now the men turned to and went back to their hammering . Binkley and I tried to figure out where the Japs would run their patrol lines in that area . Now , since they had Mindanao , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running from their big mandated island of Palau over to Davao on Mindanao , and they would sight us if we tried to cross that line during daylight . To meet the situation , we cut over to the southeast . We would n't get away from Mindanao quite so fast , but we would be well past the patrol lines when the sun came up . During the twilight hour we refueled . The sudden quiet was somehow shocking . We had n't realized how accustomed we 'd grown to the sound of the engine . Our voices sounded unnaturally loud in our ears , and we felt vaguely that something was wrong . The men could hardly wait until we started up again . Then , with the engine snoring a steady string of fat-man snores in the stern , they relaxed . The next day the weather was friendly and our wake fanned out behind us , making twin lines of tumbling milk curds on the gray waste . The men 's restlessness was getting chronic and they began to crawl around the boat , driven by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few feet . When Swisher was n't standing watch , he slept , and when he got ashore , he slept some more . He took a terrific needling for his dormouse tendencies , but did n't seem to resent it . We did n't know it then , but he had a piece of shrapnel embedded deeply in his flesh and pressing against his backbone , and it hurt him when he moved . He knew it himself , but he kept buttoned up about it , because he knew there was nothing we could do about it . In the afternoon we spent a lot of time comparing notes on our doings back at Corregidor and Bataan . Our radioman , Kenney , had rigged up a loudspeaker system on the Quail , so we could give theengineers down in the black hold a play-by-play account of what was going on up above from the bridge . When bombs fell near by and the concussion buckled and bent our plates inward , the boys down below could take a vicarious part in the things we were doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that they could always tell whether we were chasing the Japs or being chased by them . When they got the full-speed bell , with no chatter over the loud-speaker , they knew that we were doing a snake dance across the water to dodge the bombs being dumped on us . When that was going on we had no time for bomb-casting the news below , so they 'd stand down there with their knees bent , waiting for the jolt of an explosion outside , and when it came they said they felt as though the ship was falling right into their laps . The men began to work on the idea that when we got down to the Dutch East Indies and bumped into any craft flying a red ball , they 'd open a one-boat front . We had the mast , boom and sail stowed alongside , and now they worked loopholes in them through which we could stick our automatic rifles and still keep ourselves out of sight , except for the man at the tiller . Darkness falls with a heavy hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we had just a few more minutes in which to catch a last cigarette before the long cigaretteless night watches . Doc Head reached into his locker beneath the sea boards and announced that there was just one cigarette apiece left . We smoked our last cigarette , trying to drag a little extra pleasure out of it , but disappointingly it tasted just like any other cigarette . We had our final drag just as a moonless night closed in upon us . Haley called me in the morning , and I found that we were off the northeast coast of 1VI orotai . The surf was n't a high one , the sea broke only three or four feet over the reef , but we could n't see any break in it . When you climb over a reef in a motor-powered boat , you do n't know what you 're going to hit on the other side . You might land squarely on coral heads or split your bottom wide open in shallow water only six inches deep , so we ran for two hours , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast . In the middle of breakfast Taylor said , " If that ai n't a red-ball flag , I do n't know what it is . " It brought us all up with a hang ; rice and raw sugar stuck halfway down our throats . A forty-foot Jap steam launch with a Jap merchant flag on it had come out of a cove and was running along inside of the reef , parallel to us . It was doubtful if they saw us . We were a mile and a half away , and low in the water , but it changed our mind about making a landing , and we headed out to sea and kept going . Five o'clock found us off the northeast coast of Halmahera , headed south . Since it was late afternoon , there was no point in going ashore . Nighttime was the time for us to do our traveling . But for three solid days we had been so cramped that the confinement was beginning to make us cranky , so I combed that chart for a tiny island too insignificant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find some corn silk we can smoke , " Rankin said wistfully . I picked out a little island just off the coast of Halmahera , sixty miles to the south . Its name was Sajafi . The men complained that the natives ought to put up signs on their islands with names on them , to make it easier for Continued on Page 38 ) ( Continued from Page 29 ) us , like : " You are now entering Sajafi , hellhole of the Southern Pacific . The Lions Club meets every Tuesday at the Coconut Inn . " We were in a strong current , making almost eight knots . I showed Taylor the chart and warned him about the danger of overshooting Sajafi because of our speed . I told him that if he got there before morning he should lie to and wait for daybreak . I slept like a log . The next thing I knew , he was leaning over me , saying , " There 's an extra heavy rain squall moving over toward us and I wanted you to see the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've been lying here since one o'clock . " The island was less than hall a mile away . " Are you sure it 's Sajafi ? " I asked him . " Sajafi , or Long Island , it looks all the same to me , " he said . " I just did what you told me to and stopped when we came to an island on our port . " I told Stringer to get the engine started , so we could run in and anchor there until daylight . We were able to get up on the beach on a sandy bottom , fifty feet from shore , where we could wade the rest of the way . A group of natives had gathered on the beach . We sent Head and Swisher pushing through the wavelets lapping along the shore to find out what the situation was and let us know before we lugged our camp gear ashore . Swisher claimed to be able to speak Dutch and we thought that might help . Swisher did n't seem to be saying much , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motions . We yelled over , " What do they say , Swisher ? " He yelled back , " You got me ! " " Well , talk Dutch to ' em ! " " These jerks do n't even know their own language ! They do n't even know Tagalog I " Head was making out better . At least they were nodding to him . " Doc , what 's the dope ? " we called . " It 's okay ! " he yelled . " I 'm trading my drawers for a load of coconuts ! " We wondered where Doc had got them . None of the rest of us had any underwear . " That doe 's got everything , " Cucinello said . " If we only knew the truth , he 's probably got a blonde in those duffel bags of his . " I jumped into the water and went up to Head to find out how he was making out . He said he was making out fine . " All I need is to be left alone , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He waved his arms around and drew pictures in the sand with a stick . He claimed he had already swapped them Only the bathing was n't much good , because therewere crocodiles six feet long in the creek they sent us to . In the evening we shoved off , pretending we were headed toward Halmahera . After dark we cut southeast to approach the coast of New Guinea . We wanted to stay away from the larger islands and jump from one small one to another . Before it was light we went south again and headed for a little group of islands tiny enough not to attract sea traffic , called the Jeff Family group . Reaching the outer rim of the group , we picked a deserted island , a small one with no underbrush , so low lying that during storms the seas had washed right over it . It was a rocky outcropping , with no beach ; and it was laborious work getting our supplies across the submerged rocks , but once ashore it was swell . We just lay around and rested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but feeling that we should have more important things on our . minds than horseplay or initiations by Neptune 's court , I had n't told the boys about it until now . The news meant to them that we were on the homestretch . They all began to feel cocky , as if , as far as they were concerned , we had dropped right through a hole in the bottom of Hirohito 's pocket . We found ourselves wishing we did n't have to go through all these experiences like bath out of hell . It was too bad we could n't pause here and there to savor the trip . A sense of adventure had begun to pervade our consciousness . We knew that probably never again in our lives would we live quite as fully or be quite as independent of civilization . We were eighteen men alone in a vast and lonesome world . But that world was intensely interesting . We tried to put it into words , but none of us knew quite how to express it . We all felt that some power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , We remembered how the Quail had survived those last days of continuous bombing . The other ships  --  the Ranger , a tugboat , was not classed as a ship  --  had all been sunk , and still she sat there helpless , immobile , with dead boilers and no oil . Some of the bombs had come so close to her that the repeated concussions had lifted her up and pushed her sideways until she lunged and rolled crazily for long minutes . The same kind of near misses had ripped the port side of the Pigeon wide open and sunk her . Why they had n't done the same to the Quail and why they had n't even so much as scratched one of our men was a mystery to us . But we did know that , except for the Quail being afloat that last night on Corregidor , we would have all been trapped there too . Then , too , there was no real reason why we should have lived through that job of scuttling the Quail . It was unbelievable that we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Escaping through those Jap picket boats seemed less miraculous to us , somehow . The biggest miracle of all had been our getting away from Corregidor . Now we were gathered on a tiny spit-kit of an island somewhere in the vast area of the South Pacific . As Tayfor put it , " Freedom is only a word until you have been close to losing it . " Being free is like being immortal . That 's the way we felt . We planned our next hop to take advantage of the twenty-five-mile-wide shoal bank extending down the coast of New Guinea . As soon as it became light enough , Binkley and ) 1 tried to establish our position . There seemed to be many more semisubmerged islands than the chart showed . The place was a navigator 's nightmare . During all that day we did n't sight so much as a canoe . Finally , toward late afternoon , we spotted Pisang Island ahead . We had planned to stop there , but , pushed along with the current , we were so far ahead of schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That night as we left Pisang , dark cloud banks rolled over us and the night was dark , with gusty winds . When Taylor woke me to take my watch , I noticed that the light in the hooded compass was very dim . I hoped it was a short in the wiring circuit , but I think I knew , even while I was hoping , that the battery was running down . Watkins checked all the wiring and we could n't kid ourselves any more . The battery was n't recharging . It meant an overhaul job at our next atop , but I knew that if we stopped we would n't be able to start again . In the gray and cold dawn , Binkley and I looked over at the islands ahead of us . We could just make them out . Everybody brightened up a little except Watkins , Richardson , Taylor and me . We had a dead battery on our hands that the rest of them did n't know about . Around eleven o'clock we arrived at Teoor , a good-sized native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would be no better than neutral , and the thought that they might be able to send off a message about us made us turn west and head for a smaller island nine miles away . It was a flat , wave-battered bump of land . We figured it would be uninhabited , and it was . " Guns , you take her in and anchor her , " I said to Taylor . When all was secure , he told the engineer to stop the engine . Then he made a frantic effort to pull the words back out of the air , and yelled , " No , wait ! Do n't do it ! " But it was too late . " I would be the damn fool that would gum the works ! " he moaned . Richardson and I glanced at each other . We had only one thought between us . I made a motion to him with my thumb to push the starter button , He did . Nothing happened . Then he tore into the engine like a madman to see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it cooled off . The horror of what had happened gradually dawned on the rest of the crew . They crowded around Richardson , offering advice . Meanwhile , Richardson was going into the crankcase like a mole to get at the flywheel . There was no crank for starting the engine , but when he got it ripped apart enough to get a rope around the flywheel , so much of the engine had been removed it would n't have started anyhow . The crew spouted optimism which they did n't feel , but which they hoped would pep Richardson up . " Boy , you just tell us what to do . Anything you want , we 'll do it , " they said to him . " That 's fine , " Richardson said ; " that 's just wonderful . The trouble is I do n't know what to do myself . " Watkins and Richardson were taking it hard . They felt that the engine was their responsibility . It did n't make Richardson feel any better that only a couple of hours before I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build a monument for this guy Richardson . " But the others , who knew nothing about engines , refused to be downcast . Richardson got the crankcase back together again and the flywheel covered up . Wrapping a rope around a small coupling on the propeller shaft inside of the boat , he tied the other end of the line to a sturdy pole . Now , following his directions , six or eight of the men took hold of the pole and tried to lift upward with it and spin the engine . This did n't work at all . The place around which the rope was wrapped was BO small that the hemp just slipped off , so Richardson sat down to think up a new one . It was getting on into the afternoon and the weather the wind brought us was bad . Somebody got the bright idea of making cigarettes out of coffee , and the smokers among us tried it . We wrapped it in strips of paper and smoked on it with the paper tubes tilted upward to our noses , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter and bit the tongue . You could n't take it out of your mouth to complain about how terrible it was , or it would go out . But it had one virtue  --  none of us wanted to smoke anything for the next twenty-four hours . When it was really dark we turned in , feeling that after a rest we 'd be better able to cope with things . At daybreak , Richardson had a new idea . " If you deck hands can get this boat close enough to the beach , maybe I can get a line wrapped around the propeller and twist her tail that way . " This particular cove was rocky and uneven underfoot , but we all got into the water and floundered around . Richardson put a long rope around the propeller shaft , wrapping it cleverly , so that the men pulling from both sides would spin it in the same direction . In our opinion , only a genius could have figured that out , so his stock went up again . We all got ready to pull . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a crank . I gave them a " Heave ho ! " grabbed the prop and gave it a turn , but the men on the lines slipped and fell , in a choking , spluttering huddle , into the water . A second and third attempt ended the same way . Silently we got back into the boat , sat around and looked at one another . We ate breakfast without having much relish for it . Afterward Binkley started fumbling with the line and the coupling on the shaft . Presently , Weinmann got interested and went over to help Bink . They were placing flat sticks torn from a packing case of sardines around the coupling , much as a first-aider puts splints on an arm , trying to build it up and provide a larger friction area . They gave it a try , and when the strain came it did n't slip . It was solid . The rest of us crowded around now . We got out the hoisting pole with four men on each end of it . When they lifted , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys were discouraged , but I told them , " If you can turn over a Diesel at all , you 'll warm it up by its own compression . " A Game of Flags On the third spin it took off with a roar . It was the sweetest sound I had ever heard , bar none , and it was just in time . The wind had been piling it on and we were rolling and pitching heavily . We lifted our anchor and got out of there . About three o'clock that night 1 woke up to find the boat pounding badly . The how would ride up on top of a big wave and come crashing down on it with a bang . I could feel the boards shudder with each crack . We kept on pounding along until , about eight o'clock in the morning , we got in behind Koer . In the lee of the island , the sea flattened out . We approached the beach , casting a speculative eye at the native luggers anchored there . White flags went up along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we coasted on down , looking for a channel into shore , the white flag on the lugger was hauled down and a Jap flag was hoisted . Looking through the glasses , we could see that the men on her deck were all natives , and we figured there was a Jap captain hiding down below somewhere . Keeping our barricaded side toward the lugger , we eased in toward it . The Jap flag came down then , and we realized that her crew was trying out all the flags they had , to make sure they showed the right one . Having run out of flags , they abandoned the lugger in a panic and rowed ashore , so we went on in . Some of our men talked to the local schoolteacher , who had a school map of the area , and brought him over to me . " The teacher can give us valuable information , " they said . As I glanced at his map I noticed , with horror , a pencil line running down from Corregidor and the Philippines right along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were now and continuing on the route we intended to take . While our boys thought they were getting valuable information out of the schoolteacher , he 'd got enough out of them to stop our clock . I was plenty mad , and took the map and erased the pencil line . Then I told the gang to call off the morning meal and get into the boat . Now that we 've given this monkey our telephone number and address , we 've got to get along , sea or no sea , " I told them . All afternoon we smashed our way through heavy seas until we reached an area of quiet water . A belt of coral heads barred us from the beach and we anchored about 500 yards offshore to spend the night . Richardson said he wanted to renew the stern-tube bearing . It was made of hard rubber , but he had picked up a piece of lignum-vitae driftwood and had whittled out a new bearing for us in his spare time . We did n't question his decision . But first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morning brought a slight slackening of the wind , and by noon we were ready to go . The sea was not too good , but at least we could head into it , Somebody struck up a song . Our singing had one virtue  --  no one could hear Us , not even the man a foot away . The howl of the wind and the chug of the engine took care of that . Thereafter , singing got to be quite a habit with us . Whenever the sea got nasty , we tried to shout it down with off-key harmony . What we saw when we drew near Taam was puzzling at first , and then incredible . Glistening minarets and towers came over the horizon . Next the purple and maroon sails of dozens of good-sized vessels appeared . Then , the town itself swam up into view , and last of all , the people , wearing colorful and picturesque costumes . Close at hand , the inhabitants shattered our preconceived notions . They were noisy , diseased and quarrelsome . We let one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a salaam , bringing their hands down in front of their faces . We salaamed right back at them , but we soon found out that what they were doing was n't a salaam at all . They were motioning to us to go away . But we ignored their invitation to leave . At nine o'clock that night the lookout reported a couple of boats coming out . In the boats were three or four old men wearing flowing white beards . We took them aboard , and the elders started a harangue about how elegant it would be if we 'd scram out of there , and again we explained to them that we had to beach the boat and fix it first . Meanwhile , they discovered that Head was a doctor , and made motions with their hands to indicate pains in their insides . Head gave them some cough medicine with a strong dash of sedative in it , hoping to put them to sleep . We sat there waiting for them to drop off , so we could go to sleep ourselves , but apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them was to make them ask for some of it to take ashore as a present for their friends . About eleven o'clock it became obvious that they wanted us to get in through the channel while we had high water , and get the job over with , rather than wait for high tide the next day . Apparently nobody in the town ever slept . They came crowding around us , curious and noisy , and one of them  --  apparently a priest  --  insisted that Head and I sleep in his home . We made arrangements with our lookouts to come in and check on us every once in a while , to see if our throats were cut . We did n't sleep much . The room was full of wild-eyed gents , talking at the top of their voices . They paraded around us , jabbering , while we lay there . We woke up about four o'clock in the morning and went hack to the boat and found the boys in a turmoil . " Ca n't we get away from these A-rabs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wink . The swarms of townspeople climbing aboard to peer into the sugar can or the earthenware rice crock almost drove Meeker crazy . About every half hour he rushed along the deck , swinging a meat cleaver in big circles to shoo them away . rIe was much too upset to pro- ' duce any breakfast . Long before high water we started pushing the boat along the bottom , trying to get as far away from the place as possible . As we left , the inhabitants went into paroxysms of delight , laughing , howling , waving their arms and jumping up and down like whirling dervishes . Just for a gag , we pretended we were coming back , and their faces dropped a mile . Dutchmen whom we met later told us that if we had been a smaller outfit and had n't been heavily armed , our precautions about throat cutting would have been quite necessary . This was our worst night at sea . Dark clouds had been stacking up for several hours , and at six o'clock they slapped us in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a big one rolled over the engine cockpit , but by slowing down the engine and being careful with the tiller , we managed to keep the boat from pounding her heart out . The Edge of Disaster It was impossible to see anything with the wind ripping the crests off the high rollers and throwing them at us . During the rain squalls the waves smoothed out , and up would go our hopes , but after the squalls the wind howled again and the waves built up , higher and higher , until we were taking green ones aboard with a thud and the crew went back to their hailing . It kept up without a letup until around ten o'clock , when I 'd had enough of trying to buck it alone and called Haley . The bilges were gurgling and the boys were scooping up water in their bailing tins , slinging it overboard , then bending again for more . I was simply and honestly scared out of my wits . Haley and I discussed how we 'd get our bow around through the trough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves on our stern . Haley figured that trying to do it would finish us . " I 'm game to try it , " he said , " but we 'll never make it  --  never in this I did n't like the emphasis he gave the word " this . " The crew did n't know anything about small boats . Haley and I were the only ones who knew what the sea could do when it was feeling its oats . The men back in the engine pit were wide open to the elements , and every wave that went over us filled their nostrils and throats . The compass light had been grounded out and we had to use a flashlight to look at it from time to time . We stood there waiting for a low wave in which we could turn . Haley and I picked out a good one , swung her hard over , and then we were in the trough , with hills of black glass cradling us for the kill . We speeded up the engine ; the boat answered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did n't take any green ones after that , and the crew bailed all the water out and went back to sleep . I made up my mind that we 'd hide behind the next island we came to for six months , if need be , until the sea let up or the wind changed . I 'd had a bellyful , and Haley had too . I looked down at the others , sleeping there in a wet , tired , unconcerned pile , and envied them . In the morning we saw the island of Moloe where we had expected to see it , and as soon as we got in the lee of the island there was a remarkable change . It was as if we had passed through a curtain , and on one side of that curtain a gale was howling like a pack of ravening wolves and on the other side r was a calm , peaceful , tranquil tropical paradise where birds sang and butterflies fluttered . It was n't the first time we had gone through such a curtain , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had blown itself out . They never seemed to get it through their heads that a lee shore could be merely a pocket of calm in an immense angry world . We cruised leisurely down the coast . About a mile north of a native village we found a place we could get into without too long a wait . We anchored stern out , with our bow up on the beach , tied to a tree . To our great joy , at one end of the beach we found a little mountain stream coming down , splashing and tinkling and falling into a place that would do for our private swimming pool . Since Australia was so near , Binkley got to work on an American flag , with a needle and thread he found in Head 's miracle bag . He began with a white oblong made of bits of white skivvies all sewed together , and worked on that as a base . He cut up blue dungarees for the blue field , but ran up against a stone wall when it came to the red stripes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled out a bottle of merthiolate , a red antiseptic fluid , which he used as a dye . He had taken a short cut to get his stars . Rather than cut them out and sew them on  --  which would have taken days , at the rate of speed at which he sewed  --  he had made holes through the blue material in the shape of stars and allowed the white to show through . It had only twenty-four stars , but we thought it was a swell flag , even when we discovered that as a flag it was strictly one way . The reverse side was a blank . After dark we sat around the fire talking late . The place was beautiful at night too . Maybe it seemed beautiful to us because we knew it was our last camping place . We had about three hundred and sixty miles to go , and if we got fair weather , that meant about three days ' running time . We could n't believe that Australia was so near . In the late forenoon of June first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was only blue sky and a bright sun . Now the men wanted to be on their way , but we had to wait a little longer for the seas to calm down . I promised them that if the good weather continued , we could leave on the night high tide . Journey 's End That night we talked about what part of Australia we wanted to reach first , and we decided that the point closest to us was the first point we wanted to hit . That would be Melville Island just north of Darwin . The food and drink we were going to load up on in Australia loomed big in our talk . Newquist was going to a soda fountain and order a double row of sodas , then a row of milk shakes  --  fancy ones with complicated names . When he polished them off he was going after the ice-cream supply . Newquist was the lone teetotaler among us . IP The rest of us were about evenly divided between a steak as thick as an encyclopedia and a barrel of beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at 230 we took the boat out . Around noon the next day we passed through a narrow channel between Jamdena and Vordate and were in the open sea and rough water again . The weather was blowy and rough until about sundown , then calmed slightly during the night . On June third we had to throttle down to keep the waves from smashing against the keel , but the gang refused to be downhearted about it . They had the feeling that Australia was just over the horizon . About midnight I woke to the realization that we were n't rolling and pounding so much , and called back to ask Taylor to give the engine all she 'd take . In the forenoon it was calm enough for us to change our course , open up wide and drive straight toward our goal . It was the first time we had done it in an open sea , and we felt like a PT boat . At two o'clock we hoisted our one-way flag , and the boys were standing up shielding their eyes with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the dot of four o'clock , we made out what looked like a pencil line on the horizon . It was low and even , but unmistakable . About two miles away from it we saw forbidding chalk cliffs , dropping straight down three or four hundred feet to the water . We coasted along , looking for the break in the cliffs that would be one end of Melville Island , or better still the Ansley Strait , which ran between Melville and Bathhurst islands . At sunset we picked out an indentation at random and headed toward it . Binkley and I looked at each other and smiled . Our 1000-to-I shot had panned out . The water was muddy , instead of being clear , as it would have been if the passage had merely been a hay or inlet . In the morning we started up the strait , feeling much as Hudson must have felt when exploring the vast bay that bears his name . We went up that passage for an hour . Finally we rounded a corner and saw several long one-story buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cove , beached the boat , and a group of very black , tall , bearded men , painted all the colors of the rainbow , came down to meet us . They were knobby and misshapen . Some of them had hair colored a violent red and scrubby beards colored white . Before we tried talking to them a white man with a long black beard walked down the path from the hill . When he came close enough I yelled , " What place is this ? " " It 's Melville Island , Australia , " a twanging voice came back . " Where do you hail from ? " " Corregidor , " we told him . " You 've had quite a trip of it , have n't you ? " " Yeah , quite a little trip , " we agreed . We had our gear ready now , and went ashore . The man with whom we had been having our exchange of pleasantries was Brother John , who , with another monk named Father O'Conner , ran a Jesuit mission there . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we landed there on June sixth at ten o'clock in the morning , exactly a month after the fall of Corregidor . When we got to Melbourne , our hotel had no beat in its rooms and we were just about frozen , so at dinnertime we all bolted down to the dining room , bent on food and warmth . The place was run on the American plan and the menu offered three dinners . One built around steak , a second with roast chicken , and the third depended on mutton . With each one of these dinners there were about twenty other items  --  three or four soups , a dozen vegetables and two or three kinds of dessert . When the waitress asked , " What will you boys have ? " we all said , " We 'll have what 's here on this paper . " " Listen , " she said . " I do n't mind fetching the stuff in here , if you 're going to eat it all , and not leave half of it for me to take back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purr . It boomed over the room , and the rest of the diners stopped eating to look at us . " You bring it out , sister , and leave the rest to us , " we told her . She brought it out and we ate it . Newquist topped off his chicken and fixin 's with three different kinds of ice cream . When we were through we let our belts out a notch and said , " How about the other dinners ? " She went away looking wild-eyed , and we saw her discussing the thing with the woman who ran the place . The news percolated back to the chef , and he put his head through the kitchen door to stare , openmouthed . When she came back she said , " You can have them , but we 'll have to close up the place and not let anyone else in , because it will serape the bottom of our larder . " The rest of the diners stood up and crowded around us and cheered us to a blissful and replete end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us were to be sent back to Sydney for active duty . The night before they left , Head told me the boys wanted to get together for a farewell dinner . We went in together and sat down  --  all except Head , who stood back of his chair , holding something in his hand . Home is the Sailor He began to make a speech . " I 've been designated " he said . But that was as far as he got . His voice tightened up and he held his hand out to me . " Take it , " he said . They had chipped in and bought me a watch . On the inside of its case were engraved the words : To OUR GALLANT SKIPPER , FROM SEVENTEEN GRATEFUL MEN . I stood up and tried to make a speech myself , but I was as bad as Head . So I said , " Well , you know how I feel about it , " and quit . It seemed to be enough . Having got all that off our minds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Miami , everything seemed marvelously neat and clean and unperturbed and rational . Taylor and I cut across a street , jaywalking . When we glanced up , there , stepping off of the curb and coming toward us , was a Jap . We stopped and just stood there . We could feel our hair tingle like a dog 's ruff bristling . Things whizzed through our minds so fast they were just a blur . The Jap did n't pay any attention to us and sauntered on by . We were both silent for a few moments , then I said to Taylor , " Well , anyhow , we got through that . " We kept on toward the restaurant . Taylor said , " I 'm glad it was us instead of Steele and Cucinello and the boys . They might not have been able to take it . " But I 'm not worrying about them . After what we went through , they can take anything . Right now I 've been assigned to a ship readying for action on any one of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloody hell of Corregidor are far away and behind me . There is nothing those of us who were there could wish for more than to go back and tear down the prison gates of Fortune Island . However , others may be given the privilege , and perhaps not all of us will be there when we haul the red-hall flag down from over Corregidor and Wake and Guam . But all the rest of my life I 'll be waking up seeing a dock flaming like a funeral pyre as we pull away from it in the night , or a Filipino mess boy handing me a roll of pesos , or I 'll be in a thirty-six-foot boat caught in a current between two Jap patrol boats . Maybe after a long time these things will grow dim , almost as if they had never happened . But I doubt it . I think they 'll get clearer and more sharply defined . As clear and sharp as the engraving on the back of a watch I 'm planning to give my small son when he grows up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
