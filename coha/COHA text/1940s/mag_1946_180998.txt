With the pleased air of one letting out a big secret , Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corp . last week let out one of the biggest in the aircraft business . Out of a hangar at Fort Worth , Tex. , Consolidated rolled its new , unconventional , six-motored giant , the XB-36 bomber-world 's largest land plane . The development cost : approxi- ' mately $20,000,000 . <P> The new plane was a strange sight . Its 230-ft. wing ( v. 141 feet for the 6-29 ) was set halfway back in the 163-ft. , cigar-shaped fuselage . In the leading edge of the wing , where conventional planes have their propellers , XB-36 had only narrow , mouthlike air intakes for the six Pratt &; Whitney 3,000-h.p. engines . They drive three-bladed propellers on the wing 's trailing edge . <P> Convair 's unconventional 160-ton monster will have a range of 10,000 miles and a speed of around 300 miles an hour . Test flights will start this summer . If the tests are successful , Convair will build another prototype . Then it will tool up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cost hundreds of millions . <P> Convair has also started to build a military transport model of the plane , the C-99 , expects it to carry 400 com . pletely equipped infantrymen . On the drawing boards is an even larger commercial version which is expected to haul up to 275 passengers . But Convair has no orders for the commercial transport ( Model 37 ) as yet . Pan American Airways has plugged Convair 's Model 37 in ads for more than two years . But even Pan Am has placed no solid order for any . <P> Pan Am has agreed to buy such a plane , if it will meet performance specifications which . sound fantastic . To meet them , the plane would have to be powered with gas turbine engines with an equivalent of 5,000 h.p. each . Such engines are still in the drawing board stage .
