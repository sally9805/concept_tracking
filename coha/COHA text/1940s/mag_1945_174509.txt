Lonely but O.K. <P> Sirs : <P> " Women " ( TIME , Feb. 26 ) is the most refreshing and encouraging thing I 've read in months . Previous to this we all had been led to believe that we were wanton , loose females . . . . <P> Our women need the encouragement of the people in trying to make the most of a very abnormal situation . <P> NELDA N. SIEGMUND Greenwich , Conn . <P> Sirs : <P> . . . Reading these columns was like looking into a mirror , and many a man will find here the confirmation of what is written between the lines of letters from home . . . . <P> DOROTHY C. SCHATZ New York City <P> Sirs : <P> TRIPE ? tripe is the word to characterize your article . . . . <P> American women come from the same pioneer stock as American men . Any picture of them weeping on the nearest shoulder , exchanging embroidery stitches , mooning and moaning over trivialities is mere fiction . <P> MARJORIE YOUNG GIFFORD <P> Chairman <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to tell you what 657 officers ' wives are doing to fill lonely hours . <P> We have organized the Minneapolis Army-Navy Officers ' Wives Club . . . .

HOLMGREN <P> Minneapolis <P> Ehrmantrauts v. Human Race <P> Sirs : <P> The enclosed from a letter of a friend of mine casts an interesting sidelight on the Ehrmantrauts ' experience ( TiME , Feb. 12 ) : <P> " TIME did n't give the whole story on that farmer who took in those stranded motorists . It seems a family by the name of Ehrmantraut , just outside of Churchville , took in not less than 182 snowbound motorists one night , many of whom were unable to leave until the following afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the house . Some of their furniture got well wrecked and how much do you think was contributed when a hat was passed around ? Believe it or not , these rescued wayfarers were so frozen up that the total shakedown reached the grand sum of $27.50 . The average was less than 20 each . I wonder what the Ehrmantrauts think now about the human race ? " <P> H. WILDER OSBORNE Los Angeles <P> Well , apparently ; and TIME hopes it 's mutual . Says Mrs. Ehrmantraut : there were 108 motorists ; they put $38 in the hat , wrecked only one baby 's highchair , already rickety . The ration board supplied 200 extra red points . Last week Mrs. Ehrmantraut received the Good Neighbor Orchid from Blue Network 's Hollywood Breakfast Club. ?
