As turret-gunner in a Martin Marauder , stubby , husky Staff Sergeant Clifford R. Wherley of Elmwood , Ill. has made 21 sorties against the enemy , won the Air Medal with three oakleaf clusters , been an all-round good fighting man . But in North Africa last week his career was ended . <P> Before his group adjutant stood Sergeant Wherley to hear an unwelcome order : he was being sent home , would be discharged on arrival in the States . Reason : after more than a year of service , Gunner Wherley was still only 16 years old . <P> At San Diego Jimmy Baker , who enlisted in the Marine Corps a year ago , has been a private first class for seven months , was honorably discharged . His age : 12.
