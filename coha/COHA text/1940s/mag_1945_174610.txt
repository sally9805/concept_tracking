During her twelve years in the White House . Eleanor Roosevelt had enjoyed dozens of small , domestic triumphs . She had vanquished the rats , hardy rodents whose forebears had scuttled through the walls since U.S. Grant 's day . Under her supervision rusty drains had been replaced , dumbwaiters installed , glass shower stalls set up in the old-fashioned bathrooms . Last week she wrote for her column : " I always have a pride in the beauty of the rooms . . . . Yesterday I took Mrs. Truman all through the house . It was good to find her so appreciative of the things I have loved . " <P> That day Army trucks ground up the drive , unloaded hundreds of empty boxes . Packers tramped into the rooms . Servants began emptying drawers and cup boards . The Executive Mansion 's normal order was lost in cheerless confusion and lights burned late at night . <P> Down from the walls of the oval study came Franklin Roosevelt 's Currier &; Ives prints , his ship 's clock . Grace Tully , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been closest to him , gave each his choice of the knickknacks which had littered his desk . <P> Mrs. Anna Roosevelt Boettiger carefully handed packers a toy horse and a U.S. flag which fluttered when plugged into a light socket-gifts from her father to her six-year-old son John . <P> Sorrow and Work . The task of moving was complicated . Secretaries toiled amid mountains of correspondence-25,000 letters alone had poured in by midweek . Eleanor Roosevelt spent hours answering personal notes , hours more telephoning friends and relatives who were to receive mementos from her husband 's possessions . Those who saw her thought her hair looked greyer ; her eyes were tired and she was pale , but she worked on without pause . Toward the end of the week , she invited newspaper women to pay her a last visit at the White House . <P> She had expected simply to say goodbye , but the newshens , some in working clothes , some dressed for tea , brought their notebooks . When black-garbed Eleanor Roosevelt stood to make a little speech of farewell , they crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke more lightly , moved away . But a few moments later she was encircled again and questions began to fly . <P> She raised her hand ; it was shaking uncontrollably . " This is a social thing , " she said . " Not a press conference . If you want to say ' Mrs. Roosevelt said this or that in conversation , ' that is your privilege , but I do not want to be quoted directly . ... " Gradually , older women started the crowd toward the door . Shaky but composed , Mrs. Roosevelt said goodbye to each . <P> The Last Evening . Late the next afternoon the packing was done-there were 1,000 boxes and bundles in all , and ushers stepped carefully around the crates in the corridors . Secret servicemen , White House office workers and servants came to Mrs. Roosevelt 's upstairs study to say goodbye . She thanked them , her voice warm , her face strained . Others came- " Bernie " Baruch , Judge Rosenman , Admiral Leahy . She chatted with each one , then went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early evening , she put on her coat and hat . In the White House rooms past which she walked , the outlines of vanished pictures showed on bare walls .
