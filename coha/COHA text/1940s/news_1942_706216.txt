txt Governor Lehman submitted tonight to the Legislature a State budget which will drastically and immediately reduce the State income tax burden . Virtually certain of adoption by the Republican-controlled Senate and Assembly , it calls for a 25 per cent emergency reduction in the income tax payable this April 15 and April 15 , 1943 . Calculated in terms of cash , the move reduces the State income tax bill by $21,600,000 this year and by $19,000,000 next year as compared with what the taxpayers expected to pay . But actually the saving over last year 's tax will be virtually doubled , since the rper cent " emergency " over-all tax yielding $21,000,000 annually since 1936 was not re-enacted last year . Thus , the State tax bill will be $42,600,000 less this year than last and $40,000,000 less next year than in 1941 , if calculated on the same tax base , although the Governor is counting on increased taxable earnings to make up part of the drop . In terms of percentage , small taxpayers will save as much as 50 per cent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent . The budget itself is $380,700,000 , or five millions less than last year . Throughout it reflects lessened spending , as well as the rapid change in the economy of the people of the State expected to be accelerated by the war . Taxpayer to Make Deduction In putting the income tax reduction into effect the taxpayer will calculate his tax at the present normal rates , which range from 2 to 7 per cent , and then , instead of adding a 1 per cent over-all tax , he will now subtract , deducting 25 per cent from his normal tax figures . Stickers added to the already printed tax returns will probably be used to convey this procedure to the taxpayers . The Governor 's budget stroke was a daring one , exceeding in its benefits to taxpayers all of the advance predictions . A tax reduction , effective immediately or next year , had been hoped for . Instead , the Governor made it effective for both years . The Governor cast aside as a " rich man 's plan " the widely discussed proposal that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the tax base of the State income taxpayer . He said that it would reduce the taxes on a $1,000,000 income by 72 per cent and on a $5,000 income by 5 per cent , whereas his own flat 25 per cent reduction for all would be a more equitable form of relief . Major Points in Fiscal Plan Nis fiscal plan contained many other outstanding features , among them the following : Agreement with the Moffat Republican plan to change the date of the State 's fiscal year , starting next year if it can be worked out Bo that quarterly installment payments of the income tax may begin in April , 1944 . ( There was no mention of that part of the plan which would permit installment payments starting this year , through a device precrediting the delayed revenues , because this was put forward after the budget was in the hands of the printer . ) A demand by the Governor , which he to in a position to carry ' oat , for a complete embargo on all capital outlays financed by bond isues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing . Creation of a reservoir of delayed public works in this manner , for post-war building , totaling $340,000,00 . Computation of all State revenues on the basis of a rapidly diminishing return from taxable consumer goods , such as automobiles , gasoline and alcohol , but a rapidly increasing return from business taxes . Ignoring of the commitment made by Republican leaders some months ago for raising the pay of State employes , to meet the increase in the cost of living . If the Republicans want to keep this commitment , they will have to cut the Governor 's budget or dig up extra revenues , since the Governor 's twoyear fiscal plan leaves a margin of only $2,000,000 . The Governor set aside $5,000 , -1 000 for defense in his budget , of which $1,800,000 has already been spent . Of the balance , there are two potentially controversial items , the first being $1,000,000 set aside for the Governor as Commander'l in Chief of the State Guard and ' the second for the State Defense Council . Effecting of Budget Reduction In cutting the budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all capital outlays normally financed with cash except the $7,000,000 for new highway construction . He benefited also by a $6,500 , - 000 in the estimate of home relief needs for the coming year , by a $2,100,000 decline in State aid for schools , due to decreased school enrollments , and a drop of $1,900 , - 000 in old-age assistance and aid to dependent - children requirements . He allowed also for a $6,000,000 lapse in appropriations already made . To offset this , in part , he had a debt service rise of $3,300,000 , because last year 's debt service was artificially low , an increase of $3,300,000 in cost of food and fuel for State institutions and an increase of $1,500,000 due to statutory salary increments . He kept State aid for education cut to the 98 per cent of full State aid policy adopted several years ago , and again cut State aid for town and county highways to the level the Republicans once set , and now regret . Financing of the Tax Cut The Governor was able achieve the tax reduction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which ends June 30 , with a surplus of a little over $7,000,000 . The State 's net expenditures he figured at $382,500,000 , and collections at $409,000,000 , giving him an additional surplus of about $26 , - 500,000 , which plus the $7,000,000 would total $33,500,000 . Of the first 25 per cent tax cut , $18,000,000 would come off before July 1 , leaving a surplus of $15 , - 500,000 .. Next year the Governor figures on an operating surplus of $9,500 , - 000 , or a total surplus of $25,000 , - 000 . From this must be deducted $19,000,000 for next year 's tax cut and $3,600,000 for the carryover of the 1941-42 tax cut , leaving the State , on July 1 , 1943 , an estimated surplus of $2,400,000 . Losses and Gains in Revenues The Governor 's revenue estimates were probably the most significant part of his budget . He is counting on a 15 per cent drop in the revenue from automobile licenses by July 1 and a 40 per cent decline by the end of June , 1943 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have begun to wear out . From the ? gasoline tax , the Governor is counting on a 25 per cent drop by July 1 and a 45 per cent drop a year from then . All this will cost the State $60,000,000 over the two-year period . He figures on no drop in the cigarette tax , but a $3,000,000 drop in liquor revenues by the end of 1943 , due to the possibility of rationing of alcohol . On the hand , the Governor is counting on the most rapid rise in years in revenues from the corporate franchise tax , the income tax paid by corporations . The Governor figures it will go from $36,000,000 in 1941 to $46 , - 000,000 by July 1 , 1942 , and to $57 , - 000,000 by July 1 , 1943 , a net gain of $31,000,000 for the two years . On the personal income tax the Governor figured on a $12,000,000 increase this year and $17,000,000 next year , if last year 's taxes had remained in force . The State budget , pleasing as it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The drop of $2,100,000 in State aid for education means $1,000,000 less for New York City , for example . Also , the share of localities in the State in- come tax collections would drop about $1,500,000 , of which New York City ' would stand about half . The reading of the budget message brought a brief flare-up the Assembly , where Irving Ives , the Republican leader , declared that if it had not been for a three-year economy drive by the Republicans tax reduction now would be impossible . " I 'm not going to quarrel with the Governor 's recommendations , " he said . " Before we are through we may even improve them , but if the State is in a sound financial position it is because of what we did . The taxpayers of the State have paid $50,000,000 less in taxes due to our efforts . " In reply Irwin Steingut , the Democratic leader , chided the Republicans for a few economies which they made and then tried to restore to the budget in past years . But the attitude of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete approval of both the idea and the form of the tax cut . After the message had been read in the Senate , Senator Desmond , Orange County Republican , said that a more equitable way of dealing with the income tax reductions would have been to permit taxpayers to deduct their Federal income tax from the State returns . He urged passage of his bill to that effect . Senator Hanley , the Republican leader , while stating that his party was " in accord " with the Governor in the elimination of non-essential spending , recalled its past disputes with the Executive over budget economies . He said that the party would carefully study the budget before acting on it and promised " every advantage possible " to the taxpayers .
