MANPOWER <P> The cry of the war was for men , men and more men . The demand for manpower threatened the widest disruption of business and family life the country had ever known . The call was for men for war factories , for the farms , for the services . The U.S. had registered all its men from the ages of 20 to 44 ; now it prepared to list the oldsters . Franklin Roosevelt announced that on April 27 the grey , the bald and the stooped , 45 to 64 , would be registered , to be called where needed in nonmilitary war duties . <P> Among men already busy at war , in uniforms and in the confused civilian beehives of Washington , there had been a conviction that the nation had not yet waked up , that even now people did not understand what the war was going to do to their homes , their businesses . But a Gallup poll indicated that the people 's eyes were open : 71% were in favor of the most drastic invasion of U.S. family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of the transition : <P> &gt; The older men in the third draft registration ( 36 to 44 ) would be called to military service , in proportion to the numbers of their enrollment . The first of this group would be in uniform some time in May . <P> &gt; In the rolls of the first drafts ( 21 to 35 ) , selective-service boards went back through the record of deferments . Men with new wives , or with wives capable of self-support , were going to be reclassified and drafted . <P> &gt; In New York City , one of the most lenient areas of draft classification , Director Arthur V. McDermott announced that the time might soon come when children would not exempt a father from service . In Congress were bills to make additional money allowances to wives and children of drafted soldiers . <P> &gt; Physical requirements were sharply lowered . The Army now would take men with substandard vision ( 20/200 if correctable with glasses to 20/40 ) . A good set of teeth was no longer a requisite . The Army said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they looked able to keep up their weight on Army food . <P> &gt; The Army announced a new rule on physical examinations : if men seem to draft-board doctors sound of wind &; limb , they will be sent as needed to induction centers , where they will get a more thoroughgoing test . If they pass , they are soldiers . <P> &gt; Workers in war plants are also due for more intensive scrutiny . Where they can be replaced , they will go off to service ; their places will be taken by nondraftables and by women . <P> The picture was still incomplete . General Motors has announced that , with 170,000 men already at work in its plants , it will have 240,000 by fall . The aircraft plants , munitions factories , all the rest of the war 's 50% of U.S. production will need more help , by the millions . And the farmers , encouraged to sow and reap the vastest harvest ever seen , have not yet been heard from . The weight of war was beginning to press on every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
