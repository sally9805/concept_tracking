txt If war should break out between Japan and the United States , Britain will declare war on Japan " within the hour , " Prime Minister Winston Churchill said today . Mr. Churchill spoke at the annual luncheon inaugurating the II new Lord Mayor of London . The scene was the Mansion House , the Lord Mayor 's official residence . Ordinarily the Prime Minister would have spoken at the Guildhall , but it is a bombed ruin , and even the room in which Mr. Churchill did speak bore jagged scars of German bombs . Not only did the Prime Minister make the unequivocal promise that Britain would stand with the United States against Japan , but he hinted that this policy was already being implemented . He said : " Owing to the ' effective help we are getting from the United States in the Atlantic , owing to the sinking of the Bismarck German battleship , owing to the completion of our splendid new battleships and aircraft carriers of the largest size , as well as to the courage of the Italian Navy already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you here that we now feel ourselves strong enough to provide a powerful naval force of heavy ships with its necessary ancillary vessels for services if needed in the Indian and Pacific Oceans . " Says We Seek Peace in Pacific The United States , Mr. Churchill declared , has time-honored interests in the Far East and is doing its utmost to find a way to preserve peace in the Pacific . Speaking to Japan more in sorrow than in anger , the Prime Minister said that he had been a friend of Japan both actively and sentimentally all his life and would " view with keen sorrow the opening of a conflict between Japan and the Englishspeaking world . " Mr. Churchill warned Japan that with her steel production of " only about 7,000,000 tons a year " it would be " rather dangerous " for her to fight the United States , with an annual production of 90,000,000 tons , to say nothing of " the powerful contribution which the British Empire can make in various ways . " Paying especially warm tribute to the Chinese , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . the first magnitude to world civilization if the noble resistance to invasion and exploitation which has been made by the whole Chinese race were not to result in the liberation of their hearths and homes . " Answer to Tokyo Efforts Behind Mr. Churchill 's strong words to Japan undoubtedly lies the fact that she is sending a special envoy to Washington to revive negotiations with the United States . Japan has attempted to invoke the aid of Britain to soften Washington 's attitude , and Mr. Churchill 's speech was undoubtedly his answer to that attempt . The British do not believe for a moment that Washington needs any encouragement to face up to Japan , but Mr. Churchill apparently felt  --  and probably Washington agreed  --  that it would not be a bad thing to tell the Japanese openly that Britain and the United States stood as one . A second significant fact is that Mr. Churchill was able to promise heavy British warships in support of the United States Navy in the Pacific . His statement on this score can mean only that the naval policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more integrated . This process has , of course , been going on for months , but today 's speech was the first open sign that it had reached a point where the navies of the two nations were able to see the war as a world-wide whole and make their dispositions accordingly . Big British ships apparently can now go to the aid of the United States capital ships in a part of the world where such vessels are necessary . The seas of the world are now being seen as one by tacticians of the two largest navies and the naval war is beginning to be fought as a whole . The Battle of the Atlantic is reacting upon the Battle of the Pacific and both are affected by the Battle of the Mediterranean . Now small ships of the United States are implementing small British ships , and automatically the occupation of Iceland , the leasing of bases and the transfer of destroyers begin to fall into their places in the world-wide naval scheme . The title of a jigsaw puzzle enables the puzzle-worker to guess whether he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of a barnyard , and Mr. Churchill in effect gave a title today to the future course of the war as he saw it . It was " The United States and Britain Against Hitler . " Stresses Aid of This Country As a historian of . the World War , Mr. Churchill has always insisted that the entry of the United States marked the turning point then ; today he stressed throughout his speech the fact of United States help in this war . He did so by contrasting the British position now and a year ago . A year ago , the Prinin Minister said , Britain stood alone  --  ill-armed and far outnumber4d even in the air . A year ago , he declared , Britain " did not know where to turn . for a dollar . " The British had scraped together and spent ? 500 , - 000,000 , but the end of their financial resources " was in sight  --  nay it had actually been reached . " " All we could do at that time  --  a year ago , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States without being able to see our way through , but on a tide of hope and not without important encourage- I meat . " The financial situation was met by the passage of the United States Lease-Lend Act , which Mr. Churchill termed " without question the most unsordid act in the whole of recorded history . " " Never again let us hear the taunt , " IVY . Churchill added , " that money is the ruling power in the hearts and thoughts of the American democracy . " Elsewhere in his contrast between the present and a year ago , the Prime Minister said that a large part of the United States Navy was constantly in action " against the common foe . " Now the Russians are inflicting " frightful injury " on the Germans , whose armies " lie on the barren steppes exposed to the approaching severities of the Russian Winter . " And , Mr. Churchill added , now " we have an air force which is at least equal in size and number , not to speak of quality , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Churchill had opened his speech with barbed references to the Nazis  --  he declared that " the condition of Europe is terrible in the last degree " under their rule ? and he closed with the observation that the British foresaw " a peace offensive from Berlin " this Winter . Rejecting in advance any peace overtures , he said : " We owe it to ourselves , we owe it to our Russian allies and the government and people of the United States to make it absolutely clear that whether we are supported or alone , however long and hard the toil may be , the British nation and His Majesty 's Government at the head of that nation , in intimate concert with the governments of the great Dominions , will never enter into any negotiation with Hitler or any party in Germany which represents the . Nazi regime . " Mr. Churchill 's speech followed the first celebration of Lord Mayor 's Day since Britain went to war , but the pageant of the day ? the annual Lord Mayor 's show is one of the gala sights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the revival of Lord Mayor 's Day was a gesture of defiance from the City , an area that has probably been hit more heavily and more steadily than any other area in Britain .
