txt By Wireless to TEE NEW Yortrs TIMES . LONDON , Jan. ** RussoPolish dispute has moved " upstairs , " to the region of great men and great affairs ; it has passed from Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden to Prime Minister Churchill , from Vyacheslaff M. Molotoff , Soviet Foreign Commissar , to Premier Joseph Stalin , and from a controversy over a strip of territory and the tactics of diplomacy to the broader question of whether Aa stable congress of equal powers n be created . At this higher level the controversy may move with advantage from the realm of propaganda to the realm of statesmanship and it may be stripped of a number of narrow divisionist issues that have in the past ten days tended to blur the great and fundamental issues that are involved . It is , of course , dangerous to isolate the events of the last two weeks ; they are inextricably bound up with the whole history of the Russo-Polish relations , in itself a symbol of the triumph of prejudice over principle and of emotion over reason . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 10Z 110 U. 40 1/1/1/V1 Nall 4 note that the immediate crisis started with certain members of the Polish Cabinet who pressed for ; a public declaration when the Red Army crossed the 1939 Polish , frontier . This statement , following upon a public demand by the Polish President for all the territory that Poland controlled before the war was , in essence , an appeal to the world to support Poland 's cause against Russia , and while most diplomats in London regarded it as a dangerous way and an un- ' fortunate time to raise the frontier issue , they were not nearly so surprised by the Polish statement as they were by the Foreign Office 's declaration that the Polish statement was " a useful contribution to the Allied war effort . " Russia 's Views The Russian reply on Jan. 11 did not refer directly to the possibility of renewing diplomatic relations with the Polish Government but it repeated its desire to see a " strong and independent Poland , " and while it was also propagandist in character it suggested that the Russo-Polish frontier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sequence of events from this /point is important . It is a known fact that the Poles drafted an answer to the Russian offer that would undoubtedly have angered the Russians and ended the negotiations . On Jan. 14 a much more conciliatory note , approved by the Foreign Office , was published by the Polish Government which did not accept or reject the Curzon Line but agreed to negotiate " all outstanding questions " provided the United States and British Gov-1 ernments would sit in on the dis-i cussions . Great care was taken at this ' point to see that the Russians received this Polish reply before it was published . Coincidentally , and ' , most importantly , Russian officials I were told that while the Polish , note did not contain outright ac- ' ceptance of the Curzon Line , the Polish Government was prepared ; to discuss the frontier dispute " one the basis of the Curzon Line . " The Timetable There seems to be no doubt that Mr. Molotoff received this information either on Jan. 14 or Jan. 15 ; but on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chose to regard the Polish note " as a rejection of the Curzon Line " and has not yet replied to the United States Government 's offer , drafted before the Soviet refusal but not delivered until afterward , to help bring about a settlement between the two governments . Supporters of the Russian case put forward three main explanations of the Soviet Government 's refusal to enter into a four-power conference : ( 1 ) The Polish Government , they say , did not accept the Curzon Line as basis for negotiations in order to settle the dispute as quickly as possible but to prolong it and , with the backing of the Foreign Office and State Department , to get at least a territorial compromise out of it . ( 2 ) Several members of the Polish Government , they add , do not want to establish friendly relations with Soviet Russia . This argument is emphasized by The New Statesman and Nation which says this week : " Moscow could , not be expected to regarc. as potentially friendly a Polish Government which retains the virulently anti-Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister a man who , when Polish Ambassador in Tokyo , preached the doctrine that Poland should have a special alliance with Japan so that in the coming war against bolshevism the U.S.S.R. could be attacked on two fronts . " Fear of Spea5thead ( 3 ) Finally , they conclude , Moscow has refused to deal with this Polish Government because Premier Mikolajczyk 's appeal to the United States and Britain revived all the old Soviet fears that the Poles were trying to establish themselves as the spearhead of Anglo-American influence in Europe and that the United States and Britain might be tempted to use Poland to establish a post-war balance of power policy against Soviet Russia . These arguments frankly have ; not convinced even all those fol-I lowers of Moscow who tend to fol- ; low the Russian cause even against ! their own country . It is true that ; the Curzon Line was not accepted , outright by the Poles , but it was assumed here that the Russians : had suggested negotiations on the basis of the Curzon Line and not untended an ultimatum that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
