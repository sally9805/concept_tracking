Cutlass Empire " Oh , I heard such a lot of names , besides there 's no call to concern yourself . You 've had no part in all this . " Shiny red lips curving above the pallid sheen of a bare shoulder , she cast him a slow smile . " lf the need arises  --  why , I can take oath that you had no part in last night 's fighting . " " You 're a rare girl , ' Rissa , a very lovely armful . " He hesitated , but thought it wise to add , " Nonetheless , I fear Harry Morgan 's name will appear on a list or two . ' T is more than likely that the Lord Protector 's soldiers are a-hunting of your poor lover at this very moment . " " Really ? " Clarissa Measey 's small pink and white features contracted and , blue eyes very round , she stared at his dark and powerful outline in sudden thoughtfulness before she cried anxiously , " Oh , Harry , my love , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " He grinned . " Beyond a doubt . We are wiser to face the facts , are n't we ? " " Oh ! dearest , what shall we do ? " Not long since he had decided on a plan of action , but pretended that his inspiration had just occurred . " If you shelter me  --  here  --  until nightfall I  --  I shall manage . " He gave her a squeeze and a jaunty slap on the rear . What an earthy little bitch she was  --  responded like a pup to a promised bone . " Can that be accom-plished ? " " Where else ? " she cried joyously . " Yes , yes . Here you will be quite secure . None ever enters my bedchamber saving old Julia and she I can easily put off . " Gown flying , Clarissa darted to the door , green-shod heels twinkling . Alarmed , for some incomprehensible reason , Morgan sprang up , his heavy brows merging . " Why away so fast  --  darling ? " " Oh , you sweetly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm goingdownstairs to fetch you more food and  --  and some Canary wine , beforeJulia comes home . " Once Clarissa had disappeared a hurried inspection of his buff coat , russet-brown doublet and bucket-top boots revealed only a few small , but betraying , red-brown blood splashes  --  far fewer than he had feared . While hurriedly cleansing his garments Morgan became aware of that now familiar uneasiness weighing even more heavily upon his spirits . Only the exercise of a small miracle could prevent his capture . He found it dreadful to speculate upon the probable fate of lusty and broad-shouldered Lieutenant Boucher . Yeomans indeed had been luckier . To think that yesterday , at this very moment , Yeomans , tall and brown-f aced , had been alive  --  a-brim with ambition for the King 's cause and in the very prime of life ; Morgan recalled how he had looked there by the candlelight , so handsome in a plain , healthy , and straightforward country way that many a lass and dame must soon burst out a-weeping . Wyvern Segreant 41And what of Boucher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible reward for recovery a hangman 's noose . Moodily , Harry took occasion to scrape his sword 's blade free of the last sticky red-brown smear tarnishing its shining and sturdy length . He stepped into his baggy brown breeches and carefully secured their knee points but left his legs and feet bare . It was good again to feel the heft of the poniard over his right thigh . He whispered softly and at the same time was amazed at his own dramatics , " Damned if I 'll be took alive to treat the mob to another draw- ; ng and quartering . " Should he attempt a disguise ? No . Of that art he knew nothing . Besides , with Parliament 's cavalry patrolling every road and lane  --  for aught he knew  --  escape over the land seemed nigh unto impossible . Certainly every footpath leading from Bristol must be under constant surveillance ; by this year of 1656 the Cromwellian forces had become as wellschooledas they were merciless in suppressing of insurrections . They 'd not likely leave a single loophole . Since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Escape by sea ! He hesitated . Of the sea he  --  like most Welshmen  --  hadheard much , and that far from encouraging . Tales spun in the ordinaries were mostly accounts of shipwrecks , drownings , sea monstersand similar subjects . The sea ? He swallowed hard because seldom , if ever , had even the most distant of the family 's numerous cousins gone to sea . No . From time out of mind , the Morgans had been gently born farmers or yeomen . Farmers and yeomen were the least of the nobility of Britain , yet fiercely proud of their right to wear a crest , graven more or less skilfully , on those signet rings which signed their decisions and wills  --  whether they could write or not . It came as small comfort to Harry that what remained of his imme  --  diate family would neither know , nor greatly care , what befell him  --  the usual fate of an intransigeant son . His father , Esquire Robert Morgan , a fine , fanatical follower of His Martyred Majesty , Charles I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asylum in the Netherlands . He had left the ancestral farm , one could scarcely call it a domain , in the hands of a rascally tenant farmer . Right now , Harry was ready to give a lot to he sitting inside the stout , high walls of that farm . Of John and Thomas , his younger brothers , Harry had had no word in many a month . Apparentlythey just had ridden off , leaving no word of their intent . Perhapsthey had gone to join Sir Edward Morgan , that chimerical uncle and soldier-of-fortune one only heard about now and then . His sister , Catherine , folks around Llanrhymny thought , was living with an aged aunt near Pontypridd. 42 Cutlass Empire " One thing 's sure , " Morgan mused while picking tiny lumps of coagulatedblood from his sword 's guard . " So long as ever I live , I 'll never place my whole trust in anybody  --  no matter who . " As if to impress the magnitude of the failure , up from the street windingbelow Clarissa 's bedroom window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . Shutters commenced to squeak back , heads in turbans , house wigs , bonnets and caps were thrust out . No music  --  there was not even field music relieving the harsh impact of heavy boots on cobblestones  --  becauseOliver Cromwell did not hold with such frivolous , if inspiring , military luxuries . Morgan pushed back the heavy window frame in time to watch perhaps a dozen prisoners , muddied , wild-eyed and with hands bound tightly behind them , being hustled along between ranks of right-jawed pikemen . Chapter 6 . WYVERN WESTWARDTHE DAY DRAGGED ON AND PROVED TO BE SO WARMLY humid that Morgan made heavy weather of half-hearted attempts to entrenchhimself still more firmly in Clarissa 's favor . " Harry , you will never weary of me ? Ever ? " Smothering an exasperated curse , he managed to press a satisfactorily ardent kiss on her temple . " Sooner will Bristol sink beneath the sea . " Morgan snorted . " I loathe the sea  --  ' t is fickle as the favor of a tuppennytrollop . A pox on its tempests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet and a sun hot on his bare back  --  thus he 'll make his , our , fortune . " They both stiffened when , quite without warning , a door slammed downstairs and a petulant voice called , " Damnation ! Is there none to receiveme ? " Morgan 's fingers clamped hard over his sword hilt . Clarissa leaped to her feet , whispering , " Leave this to me . I will see that he suspectsnothing . " " Bless you , dear . And try to learn so much of the news as you can without raising his suspicions . " The moment Clarissa 's petticoats had rustled off down the hallway , Morgan slipped on boots and baldric then loosened the eight-inch poniard in its scuffed brown pigskin sheath . From the platter of food fetched by Clarissa for his noon meal he selected the leg of a capon and , while tearing hungrily at it , tiptoed over to open the hall door a trifle , and learned that he could overhear almost all of a conversation commencing below . Wyvern Segreant 43Clarissa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alternated with Michell Measey 's booming and hurried tones . Why , he could even recognize the patter of Clarissa 's feet ; she must be setting forth some sort of a meal . " Aye , lass , " the traitor grumbled , " well you may say I look weary . So I am , but , ' Rissa , these past few hours have seen my fortunes towards a flood tide . " A chair creaked its complaint at Measey 's weight . " Come but another year like this then , in all western England , you 'll be hard put to find the least trace of a Royalist . " Clarissa paused , must have been eyeing her parent . " B-but , Papa , I had deemed you to be favoring the King 's side ? " No doubt now remained in Morgan 's mind that Clarissa had served only as a none-too-keen tool furthering her parent 's ambition . The traitor 's wheezing laugh came floating up the staircase . " Aye , so I do favor His Majesty 's cause  --  when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at present , it does not ! " The clink of dishes filled a brief silence below then , " Here 's your ale , Pa . You spoke of  --  of increased fortunes . Do you mean that my clever father has gained considerable monies ? " " Aye . " There sounded a moist , wicked chuckle . " I 'm the richer for a fine fat fee from Colonel Mordaunt , commanding at the Castle . Better still , I now stand in the way of winning a real fortune . Come , buss me , my sweet chick . Perhap soon yell own that little carriage you crave so sorely . " " Oh , Pa ! " Her voice soared liltingly . " How very wonderful , how generousyou are ! " Morgan reached out , selected a cold potato  --  that loud smacking of lips below reminded him of food . Clarissa 's voice floated up from the lower floor clear as high notes played on a flute . " I have n't been out of the house since yesterday , Pa  --  Father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the King 's people been arrested ? " " Aye , Daughter , thanks to certain braggart fools "  --  blood beat hot as flame in the fugitive 's cheeks  --  " and arrogant purblind lords , the King 's men have been taken up by the dozens ; nay , by the hundreds . " Morgan stifled a groan . No shadow of a doubt but that the plot was smashed beyond any hope of repair . His fingers tightened on the doorframeon hearing his own name mentioned . " Young Morgan  --  your Glamorganshire down-at-heel gallant  --  proved not so stupid after all . He sensed his danger and , by some small miracle , got safe away . Rat the luck . Pass me the salt . " " But  --  but , Pa ! Surely , my dear Harry was not involved ? " The bang of a pewter mug set down extra hard was clearly audible . " Involved ? Sweet tears of Christ ! Why , you silly-ninny , your pretty friend44 Cutlass EmpireHarry was in this plot right up to his precious neck  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will soon grow much longer . " There was a malevolence in Measey 's tone that sent cold ripples sliding down the eavesdropper 's back . " While escaping me last night the puppy managed to cut down two of my Lord Protector 's soldiers ! " " He  --  Harry slew them ? " A stifled quality invaded the girl 's voice . " Oh , no ! " " Colonel Mordaunt has posted a reward of one hundred pounds for the capture of your young gallant , alive or dead . " " Oh-h . Really ? A whole hundred pounds ? " " Aye , ' Rissa . One hundred pounds to be paid in golden sovereigns . Wish I knew where to look . " " But , Pa , ai n't a hundred pounds a great sum ? " A new and thoughtful note had crept into Clarissa 's voice . " Why , why , that would buy me a whole new wardrobe . " Morgan heard Michell Measey belch , then emit a grunting laugh . " ' Fore God ! Of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met my share  --  ye 're the queen . Ye 're your mother 's own brat . All that doxy ever thought on was money , jewels and fine garments . " " But , Pa "  --  the insistence lingered in Clarissa 's voice  --  " will Colonel Mordaunt truly pay this gold to anyone who  --  who might disclose Harry'swhereabouts ? " " Of course . He 's caused bills to be Morgan waited not a moment longer . He pulled on his hat , but delayed just long enough to cram several chunks of cold meat and bits of bread into his pockets . Perhaps half a minute had elapsed since Clarissa 's questionbefore he entered the corridor and eased open that same window through which he had entered . But to earn escape by this route in broad daylight was quite a different matter . His danger now was as immediate as it was great . Any householder chancing to witness his departure from Michell Measey 's second-story window  --  with sword and poniard ready  --  would have no excuse but to raise an alarm . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs over the sill thus gaining the storehouse shed . A horse snorted , reared againstits halter . " Hi ! What the devil are ye up to ? " The fugitive found himself gazing into the ruddy , startled and upturnedfeatures of a dragoon who , stripped to the waist , was scrubbing his doublet in a horse trough . Luckily the fellow 's sword stood some feet away , propped against an apple tree , and his pistol remained unready and strapped to a saddle half over-set among the fresh spring grasses . The two exchanged surprised stares a long instant , then Morgan , in a tearing hurry , slid down a slope of mossy , gray-blue slate . Immediately , Wyvern Segreant 45the Parliamentarian raised a long-drawn yell of " ' Ware thief ! Watch ! Watch ! ' Ware thief ! " In the streets enough people were about their affairs to permit Morgan to shake off pursuit before it could really take shape . Being a comparativestranger to Bristol he found in one way advantageous  --  next to none of the townsfolk were likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerously unfamiliar with that complicated maze created by the town 's narrow streets and dark , tortuous alley ways . At every important intersection of streets he encountered alert knots of Parliamentarian pikemen and arquebusiers . Handling their weapons , they scrutinized every passer by so intently that Harry Morgan fervently blessed his commonplace clothes and stature . A man standing but five feet six inches in height would be hardly noticeable ' mong this shuffling throng of shopkeepers , seamen , burghers and tradesfolk . What to do ? Where to go ? Maybe he could get away on a ship . Wonderingin which direction lay the harbor , Morgan dawdled before a penmaker'sbooth . In the glass of the dusty little window before him he could see a Cromwellian turn and stare in his direction . A miller , blanched by streaks of flour which had also powdered large and hairy ears , paused alongside . " Old town 's in a fair turmoil , ai n't she , sir ? Too damn many soldiers about for my liking . " " Hear tell the Roundheads hev just nipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ? " " I 've no notion . I 'm new arrived . " Morgan nodded . " Can you direct me towards the harbor ? " " Aye , that I can . " The miller rubbed flour from his eyelashes . " And which slip are ye minded to visit ? " Morgan hesitated , " Why , I " It 'll be Christmas Steps perchance , or Priory Slip ? " " Christmas Steps The dusty fellow grinned , showed the stumps of a few yellowish-black teeth . " Why , then , you 've but to come with me . It so chances I 'm headed in that direction . " A farmer 's great two-wheeled wain , drawn by three horses hitched in a single line , ground by before them . Together , Morgan and his companion set off across a bowling green all bright and fresh in the afternoon sunlight . The miller chattered on . " Aye , ' t is bruited about that our mayor has set a special watch over all vessels entering or leaving this port . Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every gallowstree in this county bears uncommon heavy fruit . " Morgan was thinking , " Stands to reason the Roundheads will kee Cutlass Empireextra-close watch along the waterfront , and by now my late bedmate 's precious Pa will be raising an almighty loud alarm . " At the end of a ten-minute walk the miller halted and levelled a grimy forefinger toward a tangle of brown and white sails drying at the foot of Thunderbolt Lane . " Now I take it you ai n't extry-well acquainted with Bristol , " he observed , casting his companion a sidewise glance , " so ye 'd best know that down yonder 's the Lower Slip ; once there , yell only have to turn right towards Bristol Bridge and yell discover Christmas Steps dock a bit beyond . " In some pride he added , " ' T is a goodly port we 've here , and when the tide 's out , as it now is , ' t is quite a sight yell be seeing with maybe fifty great vessels resting their bilges on the bare river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misgivings increased . He foresaw the end of his wild hope of escaping aboard some vessel on the point of sailing . In thanking the miller , he took care to act casually appreciative and in no great hurry to be off over those shiny brown cobbles paving the refuse-littered waterfront . Quite without warning , a Parliamentarian patrol appeared from the direction of the Lower Slip and advanced in his direction . Apparently , their efforts had not been in vain for these pikemen in brown , black and yellow were haling along three white-faced , desperate-eyed prisoners with arms bound tight behind them . It would appear that they had been captured aboard a dumpy little Swedish bugulet lying with masts canted at the foot of the slip . Hell 's clanging bells ! He 'd no choice but to turn back from the waterfrontand back into the town . Again Panic 's icy fingers commenced to probe at Morgan 's brain . Everywhere he looked the streets swarmed with dragoons , musketeers and pikemen . After striding along for nearly an hour , wondering where he could go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a familiar street . Yes , by God , he was only a block away from Redcliffe Street . He debated the ethics of a return to " The Angel . " Was it too risky , too unfair to expose Anne Pruett to the consequences of having entertained a Royalist agent ? Mayhap ; but , God above , how dearly he needed to secure those last few shillings guarded in Mrs. Pruett 's strongbox . Still seeking safety in boldness , Morgan pushed firmly along towards the newly painted blue , white and gold swingboard of " The Angel . " He drew a deep breath , then boldly pushed open the tavern 's sturdy , nailstuddeddoor and swung into an inner gloom redolent of beer , rum and good food . By sheer good fortune there were , at this slack mid-afternoon hour , but a pair of patrons present conversing or doing business amicably over tall ale jacks of waxed leather . Wyvern Segreant 47 " Lord 's mercy ! You ! " Dame Pruett 's sharp black eyes treated him to a tingle searching look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but imperceptible jerk of her head she indicated that open trap door which , Harry knew well enough , gave access to the widow 's wine cellar . He delayed not an instant but , with head bent low to avoid a series of cobwebs and beams , went groping down a precipitous ladder-stair leading to a nearly lightless area reeking of wine , rats , and moldy straw . What little light illumined the cellar was admitted through a grimy window so small that not even a young child could have passed it . Depressed , hungry , and chilled , Morgan ensconced himself behind a row of Swedish aquavit barrels and after refreshing himself with a pull of that fiery liquor settled down to wait . Half an hour he spent starting every time a stool thumped just above his head . The rats squeaked , took alarm a moment before the cellar door opened and Anne 's characteristic light tread sounded on the ladder steps . The golden glow of a candle preceded Anne , created a hundred weird shadows . By its light her serene features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from behind the barrels . " Ah , there , Anne , dear , " he began softly , " I pray you 'll overlook my delay in returning to crave your forgiveness . I vow I Because she came fluttering up to him with a warning finger held to her wide mouth the words died on his lips . Her eyes , he saw , were entirely ringed with white , and her cheeks devoid of color . She was in extreme terror . " God help us , Harry . You must leave if you can . At this very minute soldiers are surrounding the inn . Ma says she expects they 'll commence a immediate search . " As his fingers closed over the sword grip he stood very straight and commanding in manner . " Then get back upstairs this instant . I 'll not bring disaster on you . Remember , you found me skulking here . " " No ! ' T is too late ! " " Then I 'll cut my way through ' em  --  I 've done it before . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole street is full of Roundheads . What can you do ? " " Why , " said he with a strange , savage smile , " die for the King  --  like a gentleman , I hope . Ah , my sweet Anne . " Suddenly he swept her firm figure in neat gray and white into his arms and kissed her hard on the mouth . " ' T is you are my own true love . I 'll never forget you . " " Oh , Harry , that never ' may come soon  --  too soon . " Now from upstairs rang many harsh voices , then followed the crash of an overturned bench and startled outcries . " You , over yonder ! Stand steady ! " " Here . Quickly ! Quickly ! " By the candle 's dancing light Anne 's eyes looked rounder than ever48 Cutlass Empirewhile he helped her shove aside the heavy wooden lid of a big wine tun . She peered in , seemed satisfied at the level of the liquid . " Get in , Harry ! Quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why , this barrel 's near two thirds full . Is there no empty one ? " " Will you do as I say ? " Anne implored , directing a despairing glance at the head of the ladder-stair . " ' T is your only hope . Hear ? They 're in the stableyard too ! " " In the Lord Protector 's name , open up ! " a deep voice bellowed . The fugitive nodded , plunged his hat out of sight in the wine then hoisted himself over the tun 's rim , felt the cool wine go swirling down inside his boots . Sword , buff coat and all disappeared beneath the wine , which by the candle 's light looked black as pitch . Anne , with both hands tugging to replace the tun 's heavy oaken lid , panted , " Get down , all the way down ! " But he paused with just his hands and unruly black head visible above the bubbling , sour-smelling wine . Of all things , he appeared to be biting viciously his own finger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring into her hand . " This , darling , with my eternal gratitude ! " " You 'll return to claim it , some day ? " He could just see her eyes staring in above the tun 's cover . " If I live . God reward you , Annie darling . " Morgan further flexed his knees and tilted back his head until the soursweetwine rose under the displacement caused by his body , up to a level with his cars . At the same time he was aware that a furious hammering had commenced at the cellar 's courtyard entrance . Now the wine had risen until to within three inches of the brim . Oh God , a few drops seeped into his tight-shut eyes , commenced to burn like lye . A soft thud told him that Anne must have placed some object , a bung starter perhaps , on the lid . Scarcely had she done so than there followed a crash as of a log being driven against a portal . " Open ! Blast your ugly eyes ! Open up else you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by the alcohol stinging at the corners of Morgan 's eyes was little short of maddening , and it proved difficult in the extreme to keep his nose and most of his face just clear of this pungent red wine . Anne commenced raising entirely genuine shrieks of alarm . " Coming ! I 'm coming ! Kind sirs , pray do n't break down our door . Wait , I 'm speedingto unbar it . " The instant she slid aside its bar the door flew back and , to an accompanyingglimmer of steel , a knot of very angry infantry burst in . " Stand aside , ye slut , or ye 'll feel the butt o ' my pike ! " Wyvern Segreant 49 " What kind of a traitorous rat 's nest d' you keep here ? " " Come now , where 've ye hid the rogue ? No use hidin " im . We 'll have ' im in no time , " snarled a West Country voice . " Speak up , you whey-faced little bitch . " " Rogue , sir ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why , sir , there 's none down here but me ; I 'm sure on it . I 've but come down here to draw a pitcher of perry . Pray satisfy yourselves on that . " " Aye , that we 'll do . Stand aside ! " The leader , a one-eyed fellow wearing a broad scar across one cheek , pushed her roughly over against some brandy kegs . " George , and you , Watt , use yer pikes on that straw pile . " Anne felt sick at the brutal way they sent their spear points jabbing . " None there ? I 'll warrant our rascally King-lover is holed up in one of these ! " An empty barrel resounded hollowly to a vicious kick . " Empty , " the leader grunted , " and so 's this . Let 's try one with something in it . " Immediately Anne affected to misinterpret his remark . " Why , sirs , if ' t is a drink you want , " she summoned a shaky laugh , " I 'll warrant Mamma wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canary she keeps in yonder cask . Here 's a scoop for you . " " Avaunt , and auld Clootie take ye fer a cozening baggage ! " rasped a gaunt and craggy cornet among the searchers . " Ye 'd ply us wi ' wine ? Well , ye 'll no ' fuddle us , not when we 're a-traitor hunting . Come , where 've ye hid yon clapper-claw ? " " A plague out o ' Egypt on ye , Jamie , and speak fer yerself , " grunted a bandy-legged little fellow . " Me , I could do with a dram o ' sweet cool wine . " He had actually lifted the bung starter from that barrel 's top in which Morgan crouched , chilled , sodden and struggling to maintain silence despite those excruciating pains searing his eyeballs . It was hard , too , not to choke on sundry drops of wine which , despite everything , went slipping down his throat . " No , ye 'll not fancy that poor stuff  --  ' t is sour Spanish , " Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe he 's in there ? " " No , " Anne replied and swung the wooden maul against Morgan 's hiding place . A dull thunk ! resulted to its very top . " You see ? This tun 's full to its very top . None could live in there . Yonder 's the Canary . " Weapons clinking against barrels and on the stone flooring , several of the raiders crowded about the Canary barrel , their steel corselets and head pieces giving off faint flashes in the wavering candle light . Almost at once the subaltern in command called them off . " Stop that guzzling , ye curs 'd toss-pots , and kick me every one o ' these barrels ; if our man 's hiding i ' one o " em it 'll sound medium hollow , so have a care . " Agonizing cramps commenced to rack Morgan 's back and legs , and50 Cutlass Empire with his neck bent into such an unnatural arc , he suffered ever keener tortures . He knew that he could not endure this situation much longer ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't cough out this damned liquid that kept oozing in between his lips . A pike butt thudded against the side of his tun , set the wine to lapping about his nostrils . Only by a supreme exercise of will-power did he restrain a blind , involuntary impulse to find relief . " She 's right . This one 's full up . " Anne 's voice sounded incredibly serene . " Aye , sir , yell find I speak the truth . There 's been none here but me . " Shaggy hair tumbling from beneath a bonnet sporting a frayed black- cock 's feather , the Scot continued to peer suspiciously about . " For a wee bit o ' a hostel like this , ' t would seem ye stock a sonsey lot o ' wine . " sOh , sir , aside from running ' The Angel , ' Mamma conducts a small export and import business . Come upstairs and ye 're welcome to view the town 's license and Ma 's membership in the Worshipful Company of Vintners and Spirit Dealers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of the searchers straggled back out into the courtyard and permitted the half-blinded , nearly choked fugitive to shove aside the lid . Night had fallen and the supper patrons had departed before Dame Pruett dared descend to her wine cellar and find Morgan , bedraggled and shivering , but prepared to resume his hiding place at an instant 's notice . On Dame Pruett 's hatchet-thin face was no kindly expression . " Ye have cost a poor widow dear , you smiling young scoundrel . Saving only my poor Annie 's gone daft over you , I 'd have turned you over in- stanter and let you dance your jig on Execution Dock . " She sucked at gapped and irregular teeth . " Why I do n't claim the pretty price on your rascally head , I 'm sure I ca n't tell . Old Colonel Mordaunt and Michell Measey  --  curse him for atwo-faced cur  --  are mad to lay hands on you .

" Of course ye know ye 're not safe yet , " the widow remarked , and held out a handkerchief of food , " but I 've thought on a plan that may save your neck . Now attend well what I say , sir .

" Again Dame Pruett pursed her lips and made a small sucking sound . "  --  To a place called Barbadoes , the factor said . Do n't ask me where ' t is , sir , because I 've not the least notion . " Chapter 7 . THE GIG 'S COMPANYWHEREAS AN ORDINARY SAILOR 'S VISION WOULD HAVE noticed nothing , Enoch Jackman 's magnificent eyesight spied a very faint slate-gray streak lying superimposed upon the horizon and limiting the scope of a green-blue sea . Beneath a huge bank of woolly white clouds far distant off the gig 's port bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blistered were the ex-mate 's lips by the near two weeks ' exposure to a pitiless sun that , in order to speak , he was forced to wet them . Even so , he found his tongue had swollen to twice its normal size , thus he could only croak the words , " Land ! Land !  --  Praise God , to leeward . " He might have spared himself the effort . Thirst had so contracted Jackman 's long and leathery throat that his voice failed to rouse either the woman aboard , or any of the three men who shared this foul and illequippedgig . Grinning vacuously because no one else would share his wonderful secret , he watched , in idle stupidity , an empty water keg go rolling back and forth , back and forth across the gig 's floor boards . A trifle dazedly , the helmsman at length straightened himself in the stern sheets and cast a curious glance on the outlines of his companions lying in such oddly contorted positions among the rowing benches , and broken gear on the bottom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible since , all night long , the woman had groaned and muttered , especially towards dawn . No , Mistress Pyne 's thin bosom was still moving under her stained , dark brown callimanco gown . Grateful for a false strength lent by Hope , Enoch Jackman sagged52 Cutlass Empireagainst the tiller , passed the leather-like and moistureless tip of his tongue over a series of hard scabs and bleeding cracks deeply corrugating the surface of his lips , and swung the gig 's prow towards that smudge of nextto-invisibleland . Once he had trimmed the craft 's lugger sail onto the new course and jets of glistening spray were commencing regularly to fly from beneath her bows , the New Englander fell to speculating on just how the folks back home , to Newburyport , might be occupying themselves on this summer'sday of 1656 . Now that the gig was slipping more easily along over a clear and radiantly blue sea , Jackman found he could visualize the cold , slate-gray waters of Newburyport harbor .

Probably , during these past three years , the woodcutter 's axes had driven much further back from the shore , deeper into the gloom of the great , primeval forests ? Must be plenty of new cabins rising above the shining pearl-gray shingle on the beach . Was this a Sunday ? No , probably not . Sunday seldom had proved a lucky day for the Reverend Mr. Joshua Jackman 's third son . ' T was that day of the week which had witnessed his primary undoing . To this hour Enoch still could n't see what was so sinful about leading a fairly normal life on the Sabbath . Provided a body attended church twice on the Lord 's Day , surely , a great and all-wise God was n't likely to damn forever a sober-enough young fellow , just because he felt minded to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river 's mouth ? Inevitably young Jackman 's reflections wandered back to that terrible Sabbath day , near three years ago , when , despite the strictures of his father , the Reverend Joshua Jackman , he 'd not denied an urge to row upstream to a spot where stately dark green spruces marched right down to the edge of the river 's clear brown-black water . There , he 'd anchored , had rigged his alder-branch pole , and had baited his hook with a fat quahaug . The torn cod had proved uncommon plentiful and hungry . None would have been any the wiser concerning this trifling and most satisfactory transgression , had not that spiteful and sanctimonious cripple , Jabez Loring , happened by in time to see the minister 's son lugging a handsome string of fish into a springhouse back of the Reverend Jackman'scabin . Pretty soon , Jackman calculated , the sun would heave itself over the horizon and waken his boatmates to some fine new hopes . What could that land be ? In these past two weeks the gig must have sailed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Dutch , or possibly , a British island ? God send it would n't prove to be Spanish ! Later Paul Coggins and Peter Newton , two of the sheriff 's men , came sidling up with a warrant to arrest him for a stubborn , persistent and unrepentant Sabbath breaker . Jackman 's long jaw tightened . Well , right or wrong , he 'd put up such a main fine struggle they 'd ended by cracking him over the sconce with their staves and , in so doing , had near split his scalp in two . Right now he could remember his sense of outrage at being hauled across NewburyportCommon with wrists lashed behind him , like a common felon  --  and all because he 'd caught a dozen or so tom cods without disturbing anyone whatsoever . Now that the usual morning wind had commenced blowing , the gig commenced to lift and roll more sharply , but the crisp and rhythmic swish-swishing of waves alongside did nothing towards calming the violenceof Enoch Jackman 's emotions . Very distinctly , he could see again every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any granite reef in Massachusetts Bay , they 'd not softened a mite at his frank confession and promise never to repeat the offense . Grimly , the judge had condemned Freeman Enoch Jackman to suffer twenty lashes laid across his bare back and then to stand exposed one full day in the public pillory . The pillory , conceivably , he might have put up with , many a good resident of Massachusetts Bay Colony had stood in the center of the Common to expiate some minor infraction of the community 's sumptuary laws , but to be publicly scourged was an indignity at which body and soul both had revolted . A convincing pretense of becoming meek and resigned had deceived Peter Newton , the jailer , just long enough to afford Enoch Jackman the opportunity of fetching his unwary turnkey a smacking blow on the jaw that had dropped him half dazed to the floor . All the same , Newton had recovered quickly enough to alarm Lem Turner , one of the town 's roundsmen , lounging near the jail 's entrance . " No , ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised his leaded pole axe . No other choice had remained than for Jackman to snatch Peter Newton'shalbert from its rack and with it lunge at him who , with more valor than sense , was attempting to prevent the prisoner 's escape . Even now , Jackman could recall his amazement at the ridiculous ease with which the halbert 's point had disappeared deep , deep into big Lem Turner 's belly . What a weird expression of amazed bewilderment had formed on Turner 's face as , coughing furiously , he staggered crazily side , wise , all the while wrenching futilely at the halbert 's tough elm shaft . Long before the prisoner had run half the distance down that sunny , 54 Cutlass Empire Wyvern Segreant 55sandy street winding off towards the forest , Lem Turner had collapsed like a sack of oats on the jail 's doorstep  --  and all on account of a mess of torn cod ! " If only Lem had n't tried to block me , " Jackman thought . " ' T is cer- taro sure I 'll never again lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yielding wearily to the gig 's now lively motion , Jackman 's bright blue eyes peered out from yellow-brown hol- lows to survey intently the summit of a range of jagged , dark blue moun- tains rising slowly above the blue-green sea . Did it look in any way familiar ? During the past three years he 'd come , like most capable mariners , to memorize the silhouettes of a dozen coast lines and half a hundred islands . No . For all he could tell yonder land might be Brazil . Sighing and rubbing at his inflamed eyelids , he returned to his rumi- nations . More earnestly now , the New Englander fell to conjecturing once more as to the identity of this land ahead . From the way it came up from the sea he allowed that yonder lay an island ; a big one , because more and more blue-gray peaks were becoming visible . What fate awaited them yonder ? Well , they stood to find out , soon enough , since they 'd no alternative save to make for that land with all speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's crew deader than so many mackerels sun- dried and packed in a barrel . Jackman braced a naked foot against the pull of the rudder , then , in renewed interest , ran an eye , one by one , over the huddled forms of his still unconscious boatmates . Fortunate for them that Enoch Jackman had elected to tumble into the gig with them just before the Prosperous , dismasted , storm-racked , and leaking like a market basket , had fetched a mighty sigh , then had turned half over before sinking , without any particular fuss , out of sight forever . Aye , ' t was chancey for them since not aman-jack among his corn- panions knew a gaff from a marlinespike , for all that they 'd proved as courageous as they were hardy . Nor was Mistress Kate Pyne , the solitary female , lacking in fortitude ; poor soul , she had been sea-sick to the verge of phrenzy ever since leaving Avon Mouth . Had this sober-eyed , shy young woman not been enjoying the prime of life  --  he judged Mistress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long since have succumbed . Right now she was in a deplor- able state with face , arms and bare feet cruelly blistered and peeling . How badly she felt was attested by the way her hair dangled in neglect about her face . Kate Pyne 's narrow shoulders and hips lent the impression that she was short , but she was n't , she stood a good four feet six ; above the aver- age by a full inch . Right now the girl 's plain , yet not unattractive features were composed in a peaceful expression . Poor soul , in her sleep she could forget the terrors of the great tempest , of the sinking and consequentseparation from her mother . Somehow she had managed to achieve , through her religious fervor , a serene confidence in the future  --  for all that many weeks , possibly months , must elapse before she might hope to reach her father 's plantation on Barbadoes Island . Snoring lustily on Kate's.far side lay Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Dunbar . Though that tough Scottish cavalryman might employ both skill and assurance in commanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved as awkward in handling sail as a cub bear playing with a boot . That jovial , battle-scarred soldier lay with gray and shaggy head rolled back over a thwart , his closed eyes far sunk into their sockets . Characteristically , even while asleep , Dunbar kept ready across his knees that basket-hilted claymore which , at the moment , constituted the gig 's only really effective weapon . The remnants of a tartan fluttered lazily above the Scot 's skinny bare shoulders , so sun-bleached and stained with hard campaigning that a body would be hard put to guess its original hues . Opposite to Dunbar and nearer the bow lay that silent , surly youth who gave his name as Throston . Some very terrible thing must have chanced in England , Jackman decided , else why should a boy of eighteen remain so confoundedly sullen and suspicious ; come to think on it , Throston suggested an essentially good dog which had been cruelly mistreatedin puppyhood . Of course , the gig 's helmsman reminded himself , most indentured servants on their way out from England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the prospect of spending seven long years in virtual slavery ? While keeping a hopeful eye on a school of flying fish Jackman eased the sheet ; yesterday one or two of the pretty creatures had blundered into the lugsail and , even raw , improved the gig crew 's diet of moldy sea biscuit . Jackman now turned to contemplate the last of his companions . The fellow lay sprawled in the convexity of the bow with loose shoulderlengthblack hair streaming down over the filthy fabric of a canvas shirt . This Welshman , Jackman silently admitted , was the least easy to appraise . Seldom had the long-limbed New Englander ever beheld a body so miserablysea-sick , and for so long . At first he 'd given his name as Hugh Morton but once the ship stood well out to sea he 'd announced , and not without pride , that in reality his name was Morgan  --  Henry Morgan . He was prepared to work hard for his passage , he 'd informed the Captain , but he 'd be damned , doubledamnedand God-damned before he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant to none save my King , " was what he 'd ended with. 56 Cutlass EmpireStill , Enoch Jackman pondered what series of circumstances might have forced this likeable , hard-fisted young Welshman to stow away in a wine cask . What a pretty sight he 'd made that morning when the boatswainhad dragged him up on deck , green with sea-sickness , his face , hands , garments and even his sword stained purple-red by wine lees . What was interesting anent Morgan was the air of command about him even when carrying out orders . Right from the start he 'd proved a strong and willing worker . God 's truth ! Enoch reflected , this Welshman fairly exuded vitality . No sooner had Morgan found his sea legs than , to the admiration of a damned hard-bitten crew , he 'd beat the lights and livers out of the bosun 's mate , a towering bully who 'd persecuted Morgan when he 'd lain green and retching hopelessly in the brigantine 's scuppers . Enoch Jackman had conceived a powerful liking for this mysterious refugee . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'd not yet learned a thing about his past . When questioned he 'd only stare truculently from those prominent brown-black eyes and growl , " Mind yer own damn ' business , Jackman , and I 'll mind mine . " Morgan turned over , groaned softly and his heat-bloated eyelids parted . " What the hell you gawping at ? " Morgan sat up , heavy brows joined in a scowl . Uncertainly , he lurched to his feet . Jackman grinned , gave the tiller an imperceptible twitch which sent the gig lurching across a wave top and threw Morgan off balance enough so that he trod on Colonel Dunbar 's outstretched hand . Dunbar came instantly awake and in an incredibly quick movement had his claymore half out of its scabbard . " What 's amiss ? " he snarled . " Oh , ' t is you again , ye damned leek-sucking Welshman ! Auld Clootie fly awa ' wi ' you . " " Easy all , the both o ' you quarrelsome dogs , " Jackman snapped . " And give over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If yell cast an eye to larboard Wiry body yielding to the gig 's motion , Dunbar stared unbelievingly on the tops of three tall blue mountains surging up over the gray-green horizon . " Is that land ? " " Sure as ye 're born , " Jackman cackled . " Then the Laird ' , s mercy be praised ! " Morgan broke off bitter curses on what he had expected to be an illtimedjest , and shaded his eyes . " By God 's shining halo , Jackman , for once you speak the truth . " He reached over and shook the sleeping girl . " Oh Kate , wake up ! Rouse up , Throston . " He beat Dunbar about theWyvern Segreant 57shoulders , swayed off to wring Jackman 's hand . " Land 's in sight . Come , friends , let 's drink to salvation . " Jackman shook his narrow head so that several locks of tangled blond hair fell across his eyes . " Be sparing , friends , come a contrary wind or an unfriendly current and we 're like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the water butt and swallowed only half a mouthful  --  he added most of his share into the pannikin he held to Kate Pyne 's leathery-looking lips . " Come , drink deep , Katie , my lass . ' T would seem we 're edging an inch or so out of the Valley of the Shadow . " To unstick her inflamed eyelids Kate had to rub knuckles hard against them . " What 's that ? " she whispered . " Oh , Harry , ' t is unkind to deceive , even to encourage . " " An you fancy I 'm mocking , " he reassured , " why , damme , look at Mr. Jackman 's silly face . " " Oh-h . Why , that 's land , ai n't it ? " " ' T is nothing else . " " Oh , the dear Lord God be praised ! " Even before tasting the water Kate Pyne insisted on kneeling , clasping hands and bending her small unkempt head in a long and silent prayer of thanksgiving . Young Throston said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploded into sullen curses on receiving only the cask 's foul and illsmellingdregs . Morgan slid sidewise until he had seated himself beside Jackman in the stern sheets . " Well , sir , and have you any notion as to what land we might find yonder ? " " There 's no telling , " Jackman replied and Morgan sensed the anxiety in his tone . " After all these days of sailing and drifting why , it might be Florida over there , or the Mosquito Coast for aught I know . " He lowered his voice . " We 'll best hold off until dark and then look mighty sharp . Pray God , yon does n't prove to be Puerto Rico or Cuba  --  both of which the bloody-minded Dons hold in force . The more I consider our armament , the more I 'm prayerful we 'll beach this boat on an uninhabited island . " By late afternoon the island , still unrecognized by Jackman , now showed a bold , rocky coast line punctuated by sand bars built by numerousestuaries . Along a majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limbs of the trees they had killed and blanched the faces of cliffs until it appeared they were of chalk . Further back , series of pointed and rounded hills climbed towards a range of steep , heavily wooded mountains towering high into the vital blue of a Caribbean sky . Nowhere was any evidence of human habitation to be detected  --  no huts , Diu canoes or boats ; not even a single blue thread of smoke. 58 Cutlass EmpireRelying upon Morgan and Dunbar to maintain a sharp lookout , Jackmancommenced to sail the gig westward along this coast , but always at a safe distance offshore . What he sought was an opening in what seemed to be an unbroken chain of barrier reefs creaming lazily , monotonously , as if since the dawn of time . Above them wheeled small clouds of sea birds intent upon an evening meal of mullets . Finally the New Englander emitted a grunt of satisfaction and , bracingthe tiller with a broad bare foot , commenced to haul sheet . Dunbar raised shaggy gray brows . " Wull , Mister Jackman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Look at the water here . " Even Kate Pyne could discern broad yellowishstreaks clouding the sea 's translucent , emerald-green depths . " What of it ? " Throston demanded . " That 'll be silt , and silt 's only carried out to sea by fresh water , you great donkey . Ye do n't find a stream everywhere , but we 've run onto one . " After posting Morgan in the bow as lookout , Jackman balanced himself high in the stern sheets and , carefully shading his eyes against the sunset , steered his gig along a tortuous course through a bewildering maze of treacherous , slowly-spouting reefs . Time and again Kate Pyne and Throston cried out when , seemingly without warning , jagged corals appeared almost beneath the gig 's blunt bow ; always , however , a pressure of Jackman 's knee on the tiller averted disaster . Presently the surf 's tumult waned and the gig sailed smoothly over a series of long , oily-looking swells towards a shore which rose gradually towards a series of foothills smothered beneath a tangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan was beginning to wonder whether Jackman had not been wrong in steering towards a miniature headland when , on rounding its tip , the gig found itself entering the wide and low-lying delta of a small river . Kate Pyne screamed suddenly and clutched at Morgan 's shoulder . " In God 's mercy , w-what are t-t-those ? D-dragons ? " Throston , too , emitted a startled shout and Dunbar lunged for his claymore . On a long mudbank , not fifty yards distant , a drove of hideous , muddied creatures were rousing and , gnashing huge mouths studded with sharp white teeth , chargingstraight , it seemed , in the gig 's direction . Scaly , easily fifteen and twenty feet in length , the monsters ran with the speed of horses to the water 's edge where , amid a welter of flying spray , they plunged into the tea-colored water and became lost to sight . " They 've gone , " Morgan gasped , aware that cold sweat was pouring down his back . " Will the brutes attack us ? " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JackmanWyvern Segreant 59roared with laughter . " No , Harry , the brutes are crafty and treacherous , but they 'll never attack a boat . " Morgan snorted . " Ye might have said so earlier . Poor Kate and that whey-faced hero Throston are near to fainting . What were they ? " " The Spaniards call ' em caymans ' or cocodrillos ' ; near all the WesternIndies are plagued with ' em . In Africa they 're called crocodiles ' and are feared as the familiars of old Lucifer himself . " Now , " Jackman stood up , craning his neck in all directions , " you , Harry , and you , Colonel Dunbar , see if you recognize hereabouts any sign of human habitation . Look well ; our bloody lives depend on it . " Kate was kneeling again , the most bedraggled and woebegone figure Morgan had ever seen . All the same her soft voice came as soothing as some physicker 's balm on a festering wound . " Praised be Thy name forever , 0 Lord , for our deliverance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more surely into Thy service . " ' Morgan said to Jackman , " A charge of powder for this pistol wouldrelieve my mind . " " ' T is useless ? " " Aye . The priming 's spoilt and we 've no powder horn . " Presently the stream widened unexpectedly into a miniature lagoon rimmed by a wide , sandy beach . A few yards inland a growth of extra lush vegetation and a tiny rivulet indicated the presence of a spring . In joyful anticipation Kate Pyne wept . " God smite me if ever I put to sea again . " Bellowing in sheer delight , Morgan jumped into clear , dark brown water and , aided by Enoch Jackman , hauled their boat into shallower water . Stiffly , because of their long confinement aboard the gig , the men tumbled out onto gray-white sands and went tottering over to the spring and there gulped the first really fresh water they had tasted in nearly three months . Using Dunbar 's Scottish bonnet for lack of a better receptacle , Morgan dipped water for Kate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangely serene eyes , then settled back in the gig 's stern viewing in simple delight , a little waterfall which came tumbling , frail and as delicate as the veil of some royal bride , from a ledge of fern-shrouded rocks high above the beach . After Throston had taken two or three deep gulps , Jackman had to fight him away from the spring . " Lay off , you great idiot ! Drink more and you 'll sicken worse nor any poisoned kitten . " Now that the sun , amid a red-gold glory , had disappeared behind the mountains , shadows appeared and grew steadily , amazingly bluer . Jackman , having twice cruised in the Western Indies , was able to spare the survivors a hungry and insect-tortured night . To Kate he pointed out60 Cutlass Empirecaremita trees on which grew fruit very similar to damson plums ; Throstonhe set to catching numbers of stone crabs which , at this late afternoon hour , were commencing to venture forth . Colonel Dunbar he posted as i lookout on a high eminence , while to Morgan he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fire . The New Englander himself then vanished into the scrub , soon to return burdened with an armful of cabbage-like leaves and a heavy bunch of red-brown fruits which he called plantains . The gig 's company dined well that night on baked plantains , boiled cabbage palm , and roasted crabs topped off with oranges and plenty of caremita plums . Even before a few stars had commenced diffidently to blink through an old-rose haze left by the sunset , Jackman arose and commenced to kick sand over the embers . " Oh , Mr. Jackman , need you smother our lovely little fire ? " Mistress Pyne protested . " The glow is so  --  so encouraging and  --  and may n't there be wild and savage beasts abroad ? " " Possibly , " grunted the second mate , " but they 'd be not half so savage , Ma'am , as Carib Indians , boucan hunters , or hell-inspired Spaniards , all of which our fire might attract . " " Should we post a watch , d' you think ? " Dunbar demanded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he explained , since no signs of mankind had been discovered . Once the last spark had been extinguished , Throston , Dunbar and Jackman retired to doubtful comforts afforded by a pile of dried ferns , heaped by the wind in the lee of a long-dead cedar . As for Kate Pyne , she withdrew slightly , then , falling on thin knees , prayed earnestly and happily for all of half an hour . Morgan , too , was not ready for rest , so he strolled down to the water 's edge where he remained a long time , staring out over a glassy and purple-blacksea . Gradually , the dull ache of his cruelly sunburnt shoulders became soothed by a cool wind which , hurrying down from the mountains , brought the fascinating perfume of myriad flowers . Soothing , too , he found the distant hissing rush of ocean rollers over the barrier reefs , and the sleepy lap-lapping along the lagoon beach . By uncountable thousands , white-hot stars appeared to range themselves into constellations such as he had never beheld in Glamorganshire . Odds blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food in his belly and , best of all , soft coral sand , still warm from the sun , between his toes . By God 's shining splendor , was n't it simply elegant to be out of that ratted gig ? Aye . Only on land did one discover the good things of life . Let other men keep the sea if they chose , but not Harry Morgan . " You 'll tread warily , " he told himself , " and be cautious , till you findWyvern Segreant 61your way about this unknown world and then , by God Almighty , " he drew a deep breath and lifted a swollen bewhiskered face to the glowing heavens , " you 'll kindle a flame so bright that all England will see and marvel . " Even as he spoke , a green-gold shooting star blazed into existence and sketched a glittering parabola across the heavens . Green and gold  --  the Morgan colors ! Here , indeed , was a fine omen that the name of Morgan , someday , would flame across the Carib Sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this gaunt young fellow standing beside the lagoon . Chapter 8 . LES MATELOTSSHORTLY AFTER HIS COMPANIONS HAD FALLEN INTO THE leaden slumber of exhaustion , Morgan adopted a long-decided-upon precautionand silently deserted the common encampment to nest up , nearly a hundred yards distant , in a small gully sheltered from view and dew by a dense growth of aloes . All the same , Morgan twice during the night roused up , wide-awake and alarmed by the heart-stilling bellows of bull caymans fighting in the lagoon . Eventually he lapsed into a fitful slumber from which , almost immediatelyit seemed , he emerged , trembling , blinking in the dark , and listeninghard . Were some hounds baying or was he afflicted by a touch of the sun ? Those were hounds and they were raising a furious , deep-throated clamor quite nearby , leaving no doubt that the beasts had discovered Jackman 's camp and were baying it . Now above the racket he could distinguish the deep voices of Dunbar Ind Jackman raising a belated , " Call off your dogs , fer God 's sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . " Morgan crouched beneath the dew-drenched aloe branches and de-ated his course . Above that furious canine clamor , he could detect men alking in some foreign tongue . Spaniards ! Of course . Simultaneously , he recalled accounts of fiendish treatment accorded by the Dons to such strangers as dared to penetrate their sovereign 's rigorously interdicted domains . Damnation ! One of the animals must have picked up his trail . Great drops of perspiration burst out along his brow when he heard a hound snuffling closer , ever closer . The great beast was advancing straight towards him. 62 Cutlass EmpireDesperation lending spur to his imagination , he snatched a deep breath and at the top of his lungs bellowed , " There they are ! First squad , blow matches , deploy right and wait my command to fire ! Second squad , level your pikes ! " The forest fairly reverberated to Morgan 's sudden deep- chested shouts . Two of the biggest mongrel mastiffs Harry had ever beheld burst through the jungle and came bounding straight towards his hiding place . Morgan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain completely immobile and keep his arms rigid by his sides  --  a diffi- cult task since fear acids were souring his mouth . , " Ho , Morgan ! Rally yer men on me . A Dunbar ! A Dunbar ! " The Scot , quick-witted veteran soldier-of-fortune that he was , attempted to Blab- orate on Morgan 's deception . " Ye 're not cozening us by even a trifle , " a voice called in guttural Eng- lish . " Ye number only five and ' ave no weapons , so be still and do n't dare to move . " " That 's a lie ! " Morgan broke in . " There are twenty of us and all well armed . " Someone laughed harshly . " Nom de Dieu ! You we watched while landing . " A third man laughed harshly . " Had you not been blinder than so many belfry bats you 'd have spied us . Eh , Pedro ? " " You 're English  --  so are we , " Jackman called . " Pray do n't harm us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first speaker . " We own no nation . " " Well , then , come on you nameless bastards and try to take us . " Jack- man levelled the useless pistol while Colonel Dunbar deftly flipped his tartan , wrapping it shield-like about his left arm . The sturdy claymore glinted ominously ready in the increasing light . " Avast there , you wi ' the pistol , " the English voice directed . " Drop it ! My musketoon 's levelled square on yer guts . Drop it , I say . " and continually bared their fangs but made no effort their pull him downs The great dogs threateningand " Restez tranquille ! " Branches rustled , then there advanced into Harry ' s range of vision one of the most extraordinarily repulsive human beings he had ever beheld . Levelling a short and ponderous firelock , but moving swiftly and in almost perfect silence , there bore down on the motionless nearing fifty , about whose head was knotted a greasy castaways a man g Y , yellow kerchief . From under this headgear sprouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ragged beard , shaggy brows and fiercely flaring mustache . Of rough and lawless men Morgan had seen plenty , poachers , wild horse-breakers and tinklers , but never anyone to approach this ruffian whose breeches of coarse cloth were belted above a hirsute chest criss- crossed by slings supporting a pair of enormous pistols . Rawhide sandals retaining patches of black and white hair protected the stranger 's feet . For a fact , this wild man suggested a walking arsenal since , aside from wheel lock and pistols , he wore slung over one shoulder a rawhide bandolierto which was hitched a ponderous cutlass . At a distance of about ten yards the stranger halted , then snapped his fingers , loud as pistol shots . " Viens , Hector ! Ici , Pluton ! " To the young Welshman 's ineffable satisfactionboth mongrels quit baying and went trotting over to stand beside their master . " Tu parle francais ? " " Of French only a very few words , mounseer . What do you want ? Are you indeed pirates ? " The other growled , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hunters and cookers of boucan  --  smoked meat . Nevaire , unless as insult , call us pirates . Now turn and walk back towards ze companions . " The boucan maker moved awkwardly because of the sighting staff which supported the enormously heavy fire-lock he kept trained on Morgan 's midriff . Silently a second nightmarish figure emerged from the profound shadows of the jungle . This , the English-speaking stranger , wore much the same sort of filthy and blood-splotched garments as his companion , but in addition had affected a sleeveless jerkin of brown and white calfskin . " Klaas ! Pedro ! Come out , but stand ready to blow these fools apart . " Carrying naked cutlasses and cocked pistols , two more men materialized . They wore round , Spanish felt hats  --  the brims of which had been cut away save in front of the eyes . Kate Pyne emitted a frightened wail . " Oh-h . In God 's compassion , spare us , noble sirs . " " We ai n't no noble sirs , ' so yer can stow that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in contempt , surveyed the knot of castaways . " Wot a poke o ' bleeding ragpickers ! Blow me , Phalle , if we come across a moidore 's worth o ' loot among the lot ! " Morgan laughed in friendly fashion and , still guarded by the two great hounds , advanced slowly . " Ye 're no mirrors o ' fashion yer own selves . " The Englishman , a short yellow-bearded rascal who lacked an ear , spat resoundingly . " Stow yer sauce , ye blasted Tug-mutton . " He turned to Morgan . " You wi ' the black pate , wot 's your business ? " As briefly as he might , Morgan described the Prosperous and her illstarredcruise , but left Jackman to tell of the gig 's aimless wanderings ; all of which the Englishman translated into a weird patois of mingled French , Dutch and , surprisingly enough , Portuguese. 64 Cutlass EmpireMorgan sensed a fading of hostility on the strangers ' part . How odd that these ferocious fellows had cast no more than the most cursory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scrub . Morgan suddenly offered his hand to the Englishman and gave his name . The other stared a moment . " In the Brother'ood they calls me Doubloon Bill , " he touched his flaming yellow beard , " and that 'll ' ave to do . This ' ere 's my matelot , Phalle , and our leader . " The Frenchman proved in no hurry to accept Morgan 's fist . A short , bandy-legged fellow with black beady eyes and a curious coppery tint underlying the tan and dirt accumulated on his visage . In the end , however , he exposed irregular yellow tusks of teeth in an astonishingly good-natured smile . Looking Phalle straight in the eye , Morgan indicated his companions . " Eight men count more than four  --  what do you think ? " The Frenchman began to laugh . He who called himself Doubloon Bill spat . " Ye ' ave quick wit , mate , the which should stand ye in good stead in these ' ere latitudes . Nah then , ye 'd best meet our Brethren . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of Netherlands origin , but was far from typical . Here was no blond , blue-eyed and phlegmatic mariner . The blood of the Spanish occupation was written broad across lean , somber and vicious appearing features that had sufferedterribly from smallpox  --  the half of one eyelid had been eaten away . Pedro , the Portuguese 's smooth , almost hairless face was dominated by dark , liquid eyes more resembling a girl 's than those of a youth nearing Throston 's age . His slight frame , though , was well muscled and proportioned . " Klaas and Pedro , " Phalle designated his other companions . The encampment of the boucan hunters lay in the depths of a smallvalley situated a scant half league to westward of the lagoon . Doubloondescribed this land as the northern coast of Hispaniola . Jackman scowled . " So ' t is Spanish territory , after all ? ' T would seem our ratted luck 's still all of one piece , Harry . " He relaxed a trifle , however , when the chief boucan hunter explained that only this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spaniards in any appreciable strength . Here , on the north coast , there was n't much danger of attack ; it had remained largely uninhabited save for scattered groups of boucan makers  --  wild pig and cattle hunters like themselves . Morgan wanted to know how many men composed such groups as a rule . " ' T is seldom more than six of us matelots hunt together ; sometimes ' t is only two . We find it easier thus to escape when the cursed Dons , " a spasm of deadly hatred contorted Doubloon 's broad features , " take to raiding us , of which they 've been doing too damned much of late . LastWyvern Segreant 65month on Cow Island , the bloody Papist dogs took pore Torn Bright and ' is matelot . " " Matelot ? " Morgan wrinkled his forehead . " Friend . I confess I do n't understand your use of the term " Small wonder . " Doubloon vented a harsh laugh . " Among the Brethren of the Coast  --  and ye 'll ' ear a lot about us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save in passing , as it were , they being bothersome , frail and scatterbrained creeturs . Instead we tykes a bloodbrother , or matelot . " Now , Phalle ' ere is me myte , and Pedro is Klaas ' . A matelot , ' e fights alongside o ' yer , nusses yer if yer falls sick . Wot 's ' is is yours , and wot 's yours is ' is . " The tangled yellow beard swayed to the speaker 's nod . " ' T is a rare fine way o ' life . We shares and shares alike in all things . " He winked . " ' T is very like being married , only better , ' cause ye 're spared the chatter and woman ailments of a wife . Tyke Klaas yonder , and Pedro ; they 've shared the same barbacoa six , seven year and ye 'll never come on ' em more than a few yards apart . " To this explanation Morgan listened in growing amazement and began to comprehend why not one of these bestial-appearing boucan makers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan was at pains to ask Phalle why the Spanish so persecutedthe Brethren , who asked only to hunt super-abundant cattle and to live in peace . Certainly , being men who had foresworn nationality , they constituted no menace to Spanish rule ? " Ze Spaniards ' ave been ver ' fooleesh , " Phalle stated as , in a straggling little column , the combined parties set off along the shore . It had been decided by Phalle and Morgan that it would be wise to leave the gig in the lagoon , the fishing there being excellent . " Zey try to drive us away by slaying on ze uninhabeeted islands all wild cattle upon wheech we depend for our lives . So now sometimes we take Spaneesh cattles eenstead of wild ones . Zey get enraged , sometime zey keel us , but more often we keel zem  --  sans pitie . Ma foi , seence t'reefouryears , eet ees one mos ' uncertaine life . " Dunbar 's balding , gray-reddish head inclined gravely as he steadied the claymore and listened , his kilt swinging lopsided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the more one learned of a strange land , its peoples and its customs , the more successfully might a soldier wage war there . To everyone 's surprise he addressed Phalle in fluent , if incorrect , French . " And what , Monsieur , brings your company to Hispaniola ? " The buccaneer leader waved expressive hands and poured out a torrent of Basque-accented French . " We hunt wild cattle . For this terrain Doubloonand I were not enough , so we ask Pedro and Klaas to join us . " He66 Cutlass Empire Wyvern Segreant 67laughed happily . " It is good that you come just now . Only yesterday we have commenced to slay les vaches . We shall hunt together , hein ? Then when our barca and your little vessel are full of boucan we all sail for Tortuga . Unless , of course , first we see a vaisseau make signal for trade . " The Frenchman frowned , reached down to pat the head of the great dog striding powerfully alongside him . " You believe me , Monsieur le Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmed no one , indeed not . We of the Brethren asked only to live out our days far from the wicked violence , religious wars and the plagues in Europe . Ours was a life of the most admirable , mon ami ; crude , certainly , but peaceful . " That evening the combined parties lounged about Phalle 's camp , feastingon delicious marrow extracted from a bull 's well-roasted and heatcrackedshinbones . For Kate was reserved a huge tongue and some choice bits of the filet . None of the boucan-makers even spoke to her , only served her in silence . " Tell me , Phalle  --  you had a second name ? " The Frenchman 's wide mouth tightened and for a little he merely watched the upward flight of sparks . " One supposes so but , some'ow , one ' as forgotten eet . " " You  --  er  --  write ? " The young Welshman tried hard to be tactful , but Phalle uttered a rasping laugh . " My young friend , of a certainty the notaire to a Ministre de Finan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed a handful of sand to trickle through his fingers . To Morgan there remained a matter for puzzled conjecture . What events could have driven such obviously well-educated gentlemen as Phalle and gay , intelligent , always courteous Pedro into the company of such ruffians as Doubloon and Klaas ? How had they accustomed themselves to such a barbaric existence ? Phalle was speaking French to Dunbar . " As I have said , my friend , we Brethren of the Coast have been forced by Spanish and Portuguese cruelties to form ourselves into a species of confederacy . Such small expeditions as ours are becoming things of the past . No longer are the Brethren content to sail in mere canoes , barca longas and piraguas , but are forced to navigate polcacres , goelets and hoys of as much as fifty tons ' burthen , sometimes mounting sakcrs and demi-culverins . " The Basque 's voice deepened and his sad , fine eyes glittered ruby-red in the firelight . " Just last spring we elected a certain number of colonels and captains from amongst us . When we return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " An admiral ? " Morgan sat up , the sand raining from his naked , sunbronzedback . " Odds blood ! An admiral of no country at all ? That is curious . Who is like to be chosen ? " Doubloon cut in : " An old ' 011ander named Mansvelt . When Ed ai n't drunk ' e 's a rare smart planner . ' E 's been fighting and pirating going on fifty year ' . ' E 's ' ad a mort of experience ' gainst the Dons , and now that there 's war again with t ' bloody Spaniards ' gainst the English and French , Ed Mansvelt should set a pretty fine price on the cruisers of the Brethren . Me and Phalle , we aims to sign fer a cruise once we sights Cayona , " he added , spitting angrily . " I ' ates the bloody Papists . " Puzzled , Jackman fingered the short beard he had grown since the loss of the Prosperous . " You mean your feller Mansvelt can sell the services of the Brethren 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English , or the Dutch ; wherever ' e figgers ' twill bring the best plunder and pay . Eh , Klaas ? " " Ja . Dot iss righdt . " Klaas nodded and tossed Hector a gobbet of roasted beef . " Would you hire out to the Spaniards ? " Throston asked . " Morbleau ! No ! " Phalle and the other matelots stared in shocked surprise . For once Pedro scowled , looked menacingly on the startled youth . " Never suggest such a thing . Many enemies we poor hunters have , but ' t is only the Spaniards forever we would slay ! slay ! slay ! Had you found , as we did last year , the two of our people they skinned alive and rubbed with pepper you would understand . " All the party saving only Kate Pyne departed on the wild cow hunt just as vast flocks of green and gray band-tailed pigeons commenced their morning flight back up into the mountains after drinking their fill at a series of small , duck-dotted ponds near the boucan hunters ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that morning , the great , coarse-haired hounds rumbled deep in their throats and lunged at leashes of crude rawhide . It being boucan hunter practice to carry spare firearms on their expeditionsas a reserve against accident  --  the whole party was equipped with firelocks , snaphaunces and arquebuses . Morgan , Dunbar and Jackmanfurther were provided with powder and heavy cowskin pouches full of bullets  --  huge leaden balls running eighteen to the pound . Throston , however , had to make do with a ponderous boarding pistol and a broadbladedspear . By hacking a path before them through an almost solid wall of vegetation , the wild cow hunters eventually gained a row of foothills beyond which were found many lush little savannas on a long plateau stretching along parallel to the shore . It was here , Pedro explained , the small red cattle and swine , planted according to Spanish colonial policy on every68 Cutlass Empireisland under their rule , throve and multiplied incredibly by feasting as they did on a never-ending supply of succulent grasses , caremites , lemons and yams . The savannas favored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the surrounding forests of cedar , oak , mahogany and gri-gri trees . Here also lived myriads of birds , thrushes , warblers , quail and ground doves . Every time a shot was fired , brilliantly green and yellow hordes of parrots screamed and flew about and carpenter birds left off their boring at the trunks of ceiba and ycao trees and fled . On the other hand crows and black-necked buzzards , having long since learned that musketry generally predicted the presence of food of some sort , appeared by tens and hundreds , circling and cawing until the boucan hunters moved on , then gorged themselves on the entrails and other dis- carded parts of the cows . By midday thirty-odd cattle lay dead on the bright green and blood- splashed savannas ; under the intense heat their bellies already were beginning to bloat . All through the afternoon fly-haunted piles of purple- red flesh grew and grew , but not too rapidly because the boucan hunters hacked off only the most select meat ; the rest , and greatest part , they left for the delectation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patience , continued to scale down out of the brazen-blue heavens . Other hundreds of these ungainly and repulsive carrion eaters settled in nearby trees to watch the shaggy hunters , now blood-splashed from head to foot , wield skinning knife and hatchet to dress out the carcasses . At nightfall the hunters , immensely fatigued , but well satisfied , had packed into camp above a ton of meat and covered it with broad banana palm fronds . Jackman and Morgan , alone of the company , made any pretense of cleansing themselves with sand and fresh water . Pedro , Phalle and the rest smacked lips over that generous pile of pink and white shinbones lying ready beside the dully glowing fire stones Kate had heated . From these bones would be prepared that favorite dish of all true boucan hunters  --  roasted marrow . Palm wine , manufactured by Pedro , was drunk in great straining mouthfuls . It proved refreshing but not very strong . Klaas disappeared into the bush but soon came striding back carrying a small keg of Barbadoes rum over a naked , sunburnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " grinned Jackman . " I ai n't tasted a thing but water in nigh a month " Half coconut shells speedily were passed about and even more speed- . ily emptied . Loquacious for the first time since Morgan had noticed him , sullen and fearful , skulking about the Prosperous , Throston smiled and joked , andthen inquired about the art of curing meat . Phalle , with a deal of hand flourishing , described how strips of meat three or four feet long and half an inch thick were laid across strong racks fashioned of thick green branches ; some of these stood already rigged at the far end of camp . The strips , heavily salted and lashed around green-wood rods , were revolved on the rack from time to time , some two feet above a thick bed of hot coals upon which , periodically , the boucan hunters cast bones and offal , thus creating a thick and greasy smoke . If the smoking process was skillfully executed the boucan meat would gradually take on a livid red hue , much the same color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ordinary salted meat found in a vessel 's " harness cask " that ships would cruise far off their courses to lay in a stock . " And to whom do ye sell the sweet-scented hides ? " Dunbar inquired . " Some to passing vessels , but mostly to dealers at Cayona , " Doubloon supplied . " There 's a pretty penny in ' ides  --  for all their charnel ' ouse stink . " After a bit the raw Barbadoes rum really got to work , and soon the hunters commenced to bawl out such wild and obscene songs that Kate Pyne hurriedly retired to the depths of her palm-leaf ajupa and prayed for their salvation . It would appear , thought Morgan , that Phalle and his companions knew what they were about . Beef marrow certainly did fine things to a man 's innards ; his blood leaped , singing a strange wild music in his ears . By the light of the dying fire he waved his half coconut shell . " What say you , lads ? Will ye join me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oliver Cromwell ? " " That I will , " thundered Dunbar . " Amigos . " Pedro 's unusually white and strong teeth  --  he rubbed them each night with a chewed twig dipped in salt  --  flashed in the flame light . " Permit that I offer a toast to which we all can drink ? To the Spaniards an eternal roasting amid the hottest flames of hell ! " Morgan never forgot how hoarse and utterly vindictive was the cry which burst from the four matelots , a cry in which he joined Dunbar , and the rest . Morgan 's prominent dark eyes suddenly narrowed as he called to Doubloon . " You are English  --  or once were . D' you ken the use o ' a quarterstaff ? " " Enough to split yer thick Welsh skull ! " Doubloon leaped up , grabbed one of a pair of boucan spits . " Watch yer ugly black pate ! " Throston , Dunbar and Jackman yelled loud for Harry to stretch out the matelot , but he proved so confounded adept that twice Morgan yelped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mane of yel-70 Cutlass Empirelow hair flying , Doubloon struck hard and recovered as quickly . Only Morgan 's agility and youthful endurance saved him the pain and ignominy of a split scalp . He never touched Doubloon with anything more than a trivial , glancing blow . By tacit consent the contestants presently paused , sweat-bathed and gasping but still intent on hurting each other ; while they rested they planned their next move . Pedro , always the diplomat , came wobbling up , giggling and holding out two shells of rum and water . " Por el amor de Jesus . Do not kill one the other until after tomorrow ; there is much work to be done . " Gaily , he winked . " Let poor Pedro win some bets in Tortuga on you both . Drink , amigo , and you , ' Arry . " " Marie , ma mere ! What lusty children are you English ! " Phalle lay propped on one elbow , his ruined but still sensitive features tender . " One moment you attempt so ferociously to crush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alors , I will sing such children to sleep The Frenchman was very , very drunk , but he sang quite tenderly , nostalgically , about a certain chateau casting its proud shadows over the River Loire . " Bring wood ! Harree . All night let us sing and dance and tell tales . " " Gladly , an you 've the mind to . " Morgan hiccoughed , grinning foolishly . " But what of flames ? So large a fire might be seen . " Ragged yellow beard dripping spilt rum and water , Doubloon waved a careless hand . " A pox on caution , pile on the wood , Harry boy . Christarmighty ! Ai n't none but the Brethren this far east'ards . " None of the revellers knew or cared the hour when , satisfactorily drunk and gorged , one after another they slumped , snoring , onto the dewy sand . Every atom of Harry Morgan 's will-power was required to guide his uncertain bare feet toward a secluded spot , where in compliance with his self-imposed but now inflexible rule , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice Jackman rouse up and watch his companion'ssurreptitious departure . Could this Welshman , so close-mouthed on certain accounts , have found and concealed something of value ? Half suspicious and wholly befuddled , the New Englander caught up a hatchet and , as best he might , followed . He found the going difficult , for now the earth was heaving and plunging beneath his feet like the deck of a fishing shallop caught in a sudden breeze on Massachusetts Bay . " Harry ! Wait . Doan ' go ! " Jackman mumbled but , oddly enough , Harry seemed suddenly , magically to have disappeared from the face of the earth . Cursing softly , Jackman struggled a little distance further into a thicket before the ground swooped up at him and he collapsed into a sodden stupor . Wyvern Segreant 71Chapter 9 . " IN NOMINE DEO  --  " PROBABLY BECAUSE THE HUNTING DOGS , TOO , HAD gorged themselves torpid , neither Hector nor Pluton roused until it was really too late . Their masters had only time to cast one terror-stricken glance at a circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them , and to snatch up whatever weapon came to hand . The dogs raised a terrific clamor and , as if to atone for their negligence , bounded growling , straight at the nearest of the enemy . Their onslaught granted the boucan hunters a few precious seconds in which to draw swords , hangers and daggers . " Back-to-back ! " roared Dunbar , his gray mane tossing in the strong on-shore breeze like a tattered gonfalon . " A Dunbar ! Come on , ye murderin ' dells ! " Morgan , crouched in his private retreat , debated a sudden charge against the enemy 's flank  --  such an unexpected assault might disconcert the attackers enough to turn the tide  --  but a second glance from sleepsoddeneyes warned that such a move would prove futile . The boucaniers and castaways were outnumbered by five or six to one and still more of the enemy were running up from the beach . " Santiago ! Muerto a los piratas ! " screeched the attackers and , after discharging their arquebuses , came charging in . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wheeled , poniard in hand , determined to hack his way into the dubious security of the jungle and was gathering for a spring when , by the half light , he recognized Jackman blundering forward , dewdrenchedand spattered with twigs and wet leaves . The ex-second mate proved to be red-eyed and still far from sober . " Wha 's " he started to pant but an imperative gesture from Morgan silenced him . Together they hesitated , heart-sick and undecided . Of the fight they could now see very little . " Santiago ! Mate ! Mate ! Abajo los hereticos ! " Plovers , curlews and snipe called , circled in high flight away from that murderous clamor in which the shivering clash of steel played a deadly obbligato to the roar of firearms . They heard one of the dogs yelp breathlessly in pain , then Doubloon 's great voice , " Come on ye bloody Papists ! There 's for ye ! " Followed an ear-piercing scream , more oaths . " That 'll be a crossbow , " Morgan breathed when a deep-throated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he sounded likeKlaas  --  yelled briefly before his voice degenerated into a strangled grunt . Among the dew-soaked ferns Jackman was trembling like a frightened72 Cutlass Empiredog . " I allow we 'd best take to our heels . Yon poor devils are done for . " Morgan shook his dark round head . " No use . The Spaniards , too , have dogs , hear ' em ? " " Aye , but " If we move far they 'll pick up our scent , and then we 'll be sped for sure . " Again Harry Morgan was astonished to learn that , under mortal stress , he could in all clarity foresee dangers and arrive at essential decisions . A huge tree spreading its branches immediately above him suggested a slender hope . This tall ycoa had dense foliage especially near its top and , because of numerous heavy low branches and creepers , it should prove easy to climb . Morgan pointed upwards but paused long enough to whisper , " Do n't break bark or scar trunk ! " before hooking his toes over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the piteous , terrified screams of Kate Pyne were hideous to hear , Harry Morgan worked his way high , higher into the ycoa until its topmost branches were in sight . Morgan straddled a strong branch , pressed himself flat as any frightened squirrel and hugged the ycoa 's trunk . From up here the camp itself was invisible and so was the ground immediately below ; consequently he guessed he must be well shielded from casual view . Jackman , well accustomed to the uncertain holds of a ship 's rigging , also had made good speed and now was perched on the next branch below . By cautiously craning their necks the two fugitives found that they could obtain a clear view of the boucan pits with the empty racks there , of the palm-frond ajupas sheltering the cured hides , and also of the beach and the sea beyond it . By now the sounds of conflict had died to a few shouts and the sudden barking of many dogs being led up from the shore . Soon they could distinguish the high-pitched , rapid voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the enemy 's landing craft ; a pair of pirogues or such he judged them to be . Using a bare foot , he pressed Jackman 's shoulder before pointing out the cause of their undoing . Perhaps a third of a mile off shore lay anchored a long , rakish craft of about five tons ' burden , probably a big barca longa . At this moment her crew were furling the vessel 's single yellow-brown sail rigged to an enormously long single yard . Aside from the canoes already pulled up on the shore a third pirogue , looking much like a gigantic brown water beetle , was paddling in from the barca longa . In parties of twos and threes , Spaniards commenced methodically to range in , and around , the camp in all directions ; several were leading great dogs very similar to Hector and Pluton . At the sight of the beasts aWyvern Segreant 73spasm of nauseating anxiety swept over Morgan . Let but one of those brutes sniff at the aloes tangle just below , then all would be over save for a futile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh why , had n't either he or Dunbar insisted on putting out that infernal campfire ? He 'd been inclined to , and probably would have done so , but for the mellowing effect of the Barbadoes rum . Swallowing hard on nothing and still a-tremble from his exertions , Morgan gave over self-reproach in seeking to deduce the fate of their companions . For one thing he could see , towards the water 's edge , a figure lying like a heap of tumbled rags transfixed by a crossbow 's quarrel . Yonder dead man might be either Phalle or Doubloon . The slender-waisted corpse of Pedro he identified sprawled in a widening pool of gore just beyond the blackened area of the boucan pits . A knot of Spaniards  --  there could no longer be any doubt whatever that this was indeed one of their small expeditions dispatched to exterminatethe boucan makers  --  were engaged in stripping Pedro 's corpse of his pitiably few garments . Another boucanier , it looked like Klaas , had been cut down on a path leading over to that lagoon in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade of a huge gri-gri tree . Two soldiers in brimless conical steel caps bent to despoil the dead Hollander . Once the body lay completely nude , Morgan watched a short young fellow who walked with a limp draw a heavy sword and bring it down with such terrific force that no second slash was required to sever Klaas ' head from his blood-smeared torso . His companion , clad in a dirty red and black uniform , first turned the head over on the sand then expertlydrove his pike point hard into the pulp at the end of the severed neck . " Mira ! Mira ! Una bandera nueva  --  a new flag ! " he shouted and brandished the impaled head on high . Morgan , sick with horror and impotent rage , clutched spasmodically at his tree and watched other Spaniards hack the heads from the rest of the fallen . " Ca n't be no devils in hell worse ' n these , " Jackman growled in a low voice . " Wait ' til " Quiet ! They 've dogs  --  they 'll hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propulsion of six or eight twelve-foot sweeps manned by chained slaves , was being edged in towards the trampled , pearl-gray beach . Presently it grounded , lifting and falling gently to the long swells . After a short interval , a Spaniard in a vertically striped blue and white shirt emerged from the invisible camp and kindled a bush fire under the smaller of the two boucan pits . Soon tendrils of gray-blue smoke began74 Cutlass Empirecrawling up through the smoke-blackened grilles to linger , pungent and greasy smelling , among the tree tops . Then commands were shouted down on the beach which ranged perhapstwenty soldiers into a double rank obviously ordered in honor of a tall figure which , wearing a gray monastic habit belted by cords jumped down from the barca longa 's deck . Here , undoubtedly , was one of those friars who , for near two centuries now , had roved the Caribbean , sowing the seeds of Christianity . Slowly , and with stately tread , the friar advanced , followed by an officer wearing a vermilion cloak , embroidered with much silver lace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect the wearer 's thighs . Above the latter 's old-fashioned morion nodded a single brilliantly blue ostrich plume . Sandaled feet digging vigorously at the white sand and escorted by the line of ill-assorted troops , the gray-clad friar tramped on towards the surprised encampment . All at once he halted . " Protect me ! For the love of our dear Lord , save me ! " From the direction of the hidden camp burst the frantic figure of Kate Pyne . Because she wore only a billowing shift , and was barefooted , she ran with the speed of a frightened deer . Tangled brown hair a-flying , she raced up to the friar and fell on her knees before him at the same time raising both arms in supplication . " Praise God , " Morgan muttered , " those hellions chose to wait for their sport ; now poor Kate 'll be safe . " " Watch now " Jackman whispered . " You do n't know thesedevils . " The friar recoiled a step to avoid the writhing fingers with which the distracted Englishwoman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's quavering accents floated up to the men in the giant ycoa . " Praised be the Lord , for having s-sent you , Reverend sir . I  --  I imploreyour pro-protection . As a man of God , make these devils The hooded figure in gray suddenly plucked a rosary from the cords circling his gown , bent low before the kneeling girl . In thick English , he demanded , " You kiss crucifix ? " Both men watched Kate 's white-clad figure hesitate , then recoil . " But , Holy sir , that I must n't . Why , that  --  that 's i-idol worship ! " Impatiently the friar again offered his silver and ebony crucifix . " You kiss ! " But , when Kate only recoiled further onto her pink bare heels , the friar slowly turned and walked away from her . Calling obscene promises , a circle of armed men dashed forward and collected about Kate 's white-clad figure and tumbled brown hair . By the first rays of vivid yellow sunlight , the Spaniards , in their cloaks and scarves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their steel headWyvern Segreant 75pieces and breast plates , suggested nothing so much as a swarm of butterfliesand beetles congregating about some attractive flower . When , presently , a knot of men lifted the semi-conscious English girl and started to carry her out of Morgan 's zone of vision , he could see that Kate had been stripped quite as nude as any of the poor mangled bodies strewing the beach . Unfortunately , just then Kate recovered her wits and realized that these hairy foreigners were dragging her towards the ajupas . To watch her pinkish-white naked figure writhe in pitifully feeble struggles , to overhearher frantic pleas for mercy  --  pleas that would have moved even a Cromwellian judge  --  proved , to the two unseen witnesses , an all-butintolerableordeal . Fearful shrieks rang through the trees and out over the beach , cries so indescribably eloquent of repulsion , of pain and of mortal terror , that the skin on the backs of Morgan 's hands began to tingle and grow cold . To him came also the sound of Jackman , cursing steadily but softly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and futile pleas subsided into a series of heart-rending moans . Then there was only the sound of evil laughter , deep curses and the hurried click of dice . That Doubloon and Phalle had far from embroidered on the truth in their tales about the tender mercies accorded to foreigners by the subjectsof His Most Catholic Majesty , Philip IV , King of Aragon and Castille , became manifest in a yet more horrible fashion . Towards noon , when the fire kindled in the lesser boucan pit had died down to a bed of whitish coals , there appeared a group of half-dressed Spaniards , all giggling and swaying , thanks to long draughts of rum and Pedro 's all-too-plentiful palm wine . In their midst they dragged along the slim and tightly bound figure of young Throston . Strengthened by that desperation lent to creatures sensing mortal peril , the unhappy youth was rearing , twisting and trying to escape from four tall arquebusiers . Jeering , waving coconut drinking cups and pieces of Kate 's clothing , the rest of the victors in a savage saturnalia cavorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boucan pits . In one horrified instant Morgan comprehended what outrageous a thing was about to take place . " Dear Christ , forbid this ! " gasped Harry Morgan as in his heart became kindled the flame of a fierce and unrelentinghatred that never paled until the day of his death . Despite Throston 's babbled , incoherent prayers and screeches so terrifyingthat the very dogs bristled and slunk aside , the arquebusiers first used a billet of wood to half-stun the boy , making it easier to bind him , with strips of green hide , face downwards on the boucan frame . " I beg you , kind sirs , only to cut my throat , " screamed the miserable youth . " For God 's sake strangle me ! I  --  I could n't bear " Then a76 Cutlass Empirewandering puff of smoke arose , set Throsten to coughing so hard he could n't speak . Poising half coconut shells of rum-and-water , soldiers and seamen stood in a loose semi-circle about the boucan pit , offering suggestions to him who began , in no great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From their perch the survivors ' horrified gaze could read every detail of the scene in an awful clarity . Though , time and again , Morgan tried to avert his gaze , he found he could not . No more could Jackman . " ' Fore God , " panted the New Englander , " if ever I show mercy to a Don , may I suffer the same fate ! " The torturers proved inhumanly subtle about their methods  --  first they built up the fire beneath their victim 's feet , then gradually , further for . ward . Lest his naked flesh scorch too quickly , they poured palm oil over Throston 's scarlet , ceaselessly writhing , buckling , bending body until cruel little flames began licking at the middle of the boy 's body . Cold with horror , Morgan could hear Throston coughing , trying to scream amid the half-strangling smoke . Every once in a while the wind would carry away the fumes , reviving the tormented wretch enough to emit wails , screeches and pitiful gurgling prayers for a swifter death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few windtwistedcoconut palms and sat there , drinking and eating their mid-day meal . For two long hours the torture continued . Morgan was suffering , too . In an agony from cramps , he dared not move a muscle because of the dogs roaming below . It seemed that an eternity elapsed before , at long last , the boy 's charred , dark red form lay motionless above the glowing fires in the boucan pit . To the evident disgust of impatient buzzards and carrion crows , the victors indulged in a siesta which continued until the sun was swinging low over the mountains of western Hispaniola and vivid , purple-blue shadows grew bolder and longer in the valleys . But then they roused themselves till , towards sundown , the last bundles of hides and sacks of meat had been lugged past a bevy of hissing , awkwardly hopping buzzards , at work on Klaas ' body , down to the barca longa . Before long the Spaniards ' slave oarsmen poled their prison out into deeper water , then hoisted the triangular yellow-brown sail . Trailing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaped a course to the eastward and , at the end of half an hour , much resembled a sere leaf scudding away into the vastness of the Caribbean . Not until the barca longa was a good league distant , and betrayed no intentions of returning , did Morgan and his companion commence a stiff and painful descent . By tacit consent the first thing they did when , insickened silence they regained the ground , was to assuage their gnawing thirst . " Odds blood ! I 've dreamed of this since Adam was a boy ! " While wiping his mouth on the back of his hand Jackman growled , " How can ye jest ? I 'll never forget this day and I mean to make it cost the Spaniards dear . Did you hear , or see , aught of Old Tug-Mutton ? " Momentarily , Morgan glowered . " There 's no call to sour your stomach in dramatics . Harken , ye glum-faced Yankee dolt . Just because I do n't bite my lips bloody , like you , do n't mean "  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't intend to kill three Spaniards to your one ! " Jackman , his flush subsiding , shook a dishevelled yellow head . " What I ponder is the final fate of our poor Kate . " They soon deduced that Doubloon , Phalle and Dunbar had perished during the first onset but must have put up a notable defense since four Spanish graves , the sand yet dark , damp and smooth on the mounds , lay marked by crude wooden crosses a few yards beyond the ruined camp . Cursing whole-heartedly , Morgan tore down the markers . " Christ above ! " Jackman yelled from beside the stream . " Look Harry ! Ah-h ! Lucifer let me lay hands on some of those Papist dogs ! " Hanging by their hair from the limb of a tree , gently bobbed the still recognizable heads of Doubloon , Phalle , Pedro , Klaas , Throston and Dunbar . Beneath the branch the sand was lumpy with thick red-brown clots and , under an evening breeze , the row of heads swayed , as if staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners had been sped . A paper nailed to the tree trunk below had writing on it ending in the signature , " A lonso de Campo Basso , Coronel de la Presidencia de Santo Domingo . " The only other word Morgan could recognize was " Luteranos . " Hopeful some day of deciphering the rest of the inscription , he ripped down the notice and thrust it inside his shirt . " Luterano " also had been carved in the skin covering the backs of Pedro and Phalle . The grisly word remained readable only because the dead men had been rolled on their backs and the buzzards had not yet had opportunity to tear their way through the corpses . Wave after wave of insensate fury shook Morgan ; Jackman watched the young Welshman 's thick neck redden and swell like that of an angry bull , saw his heavy jaw go out until its lower lip protruded a good half inch . His eyes grew more prominent than ever and shone , brilliant black , like those of a night-hunting cat . That Jackman might behold Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . Only after a prolonged search did they find Kate Pyne , or rather her body floating about a little clear green pool in which her dark brown hair floated free , simulating unusually delicate seaweed . Carrion crows78 Cutlass Empirewere attempting to get at the corpse , but so far had failed because only the murdered girl 's shoulder-blades and the points of her buttocksemerged above the surface . " My God ! " Jackman gasped , falling back a pace . " She 's yet living . " Morgan started running but halted and emitted a curious , groaning cry when he understood the reason for Kate 's apparent animation . A school of lively little blue and yellow fishes were tugging at whitish-pink viscera escaping through the dead girl 's cruelly slashed abdomen . The two survivors wasted neither time nor strength in an attempt to bury the fallen  --  teeming scavenger birds soon would dispose of them , thoroughly and permanently . Their thought being to depart as quickly while they might , Morgan and Jackman exchanged hardly a word , only ranged the stricken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their defenses , on this dangerous and unfamiliar coast , consisted of a short spear and a hatchet . Had not the Prosperous ' gig been so skillfully concealed among the mangroves fringing that same lagoon into which Jackman had navigated it , the survivors would indeed have felthopeless . As it was , they set about collecting such fruits and such bits of boucan as the Spaniards had overlooked , then through gathering darkness set off for the lagoon . Moved by that innate optimism which is one of mankind'sfew redeeming virtues , they assured one another that , whatever ill-chance lay in store for them , it could scarcely surpass that which already had happened . Chapter 1 . SALUTE THE PORTN A TORRID AFTERNOON OF LATE APRIL , 1659 , Q the little land-locked harbor of Cayona was sheltering but a handful of  --  hips , swinging , straining peaceably at their moorings . Only a few uncommonly energetic persons had remained sufficiently awake to observe the appearance of a small , sturdy vessel standing straight in towards that narrow channel affording access to Cayona harbor . Presently the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow and green flag as , from her starboard beam sprouted a soft blossom of grayish smoke . A second gun , it sounded like a heavy culverin , then sent its report reverberating across Cayona 's wide yellow beach , beyond a triple row of palm thatch huts , and on among the vivid green hills beyond . These salutes caused intense annoyance to a flotilla of gray-brown pelicans drowsing on the harbor 's clear green water . Upon a crag dominating Cayona  --  town and harbor alike  --  stood a fort built by the Englishman Elias Watts , and his one hundred and fifty hard-bitten followers , upon the ruins of an old Spanish castillo , abandonedand blown up , some four years earlier , during General Venables ' attack on Jamaica . Within its battlements an unhurried activity manifesteditself . One by one , four ill-savoured fellows emerged from that black rectangleformed by the guard room 's door and shuffled over to man a demisaker , the least of the castle 's ordnance . They were in no vast hurry in acknowledging the Free Guift 's salute ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tortuga in general . " Well , bugger me gently , " grunted the gun captain , " if this ai n't a surprise . ' T is the first time in near two years Harry Morgan 's returned in the same vessel . Me , I was a-figgerin ' this cruise ' e 'd capture hisself a real ship His companion , naked save for a pair of ragged petticoat breeches , shook a sun-scorched head . " Now did yer , really ? I did n't . Why ? ' Cause ' Arry Morgan ai n't ready to . Yer do n't find ' im tyking just any gallows bait into ' is crew . ' E 's the careful one , is ' Arry . Remember , Roddy , when first ' e made the beach here ? " The master gunner swung over to replenisha charcoal fire kept continually alight for the benefit of those slow matches with which the cannon were touched off. 82 Cutlass Empire " Aye , that I do . I was there and seen ' im , that fellow Jackman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and damned nigh to starvation they were . " " Where 'd Morgan prize that catch ? " inquired another gunner . " Hanged if I know more than she 's a Spanish coaster he boarded off St. Lucia , near two hundred miles to the east'ards o ' here . " During a long minute the master gunner watched the trim , yellowpaintedcatch begin to negotiate the narrowest part of that dark blue streak marking the only practicable channel into the inner harbor . " Well , so the first o ' the Brethren 's fleet is ' ome . Wot news d' you fancy ' e 's got for old Elias ? Me , I expect ' t was a lucky expedition ' gainst the Dons , " he drawled over his shoulder , then demanded , " Got yer breechin ' tight ? " " Aye , Sam'l , shall I touch her off ? " A bleached blue bandana protecting Sam 's naked scalp fell forward when , after blowing hard on his match , he pressed it lightly against a pinch of priming powder graying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spurted vertically , then the demi-saker boomed and gave birth to a small ring of powder smoke which clung lazily about the little cannon 's embrasure . Out from the disorderly dwellings lining Cayona 's crescent-shaped beach was spewed an unsavory mass of humanity . " Free Guift 's back ! " " What 's the news ? " " Avons-nous gagne ? " Hairy , unkempt men wearing loin cloths or nothing at all ; leather faced females making little pretense of concealing their grimy bodies pattered out into the pitiless sunshine and , blinking , slunk towards the water 's edge past broken cases and wrecked small boats . Roused from a month long somnolence , the little settlement shook itselfawake . For over a week now all Tortuga had been anticipating a returnof that little armada of retaliation launched by the Brethren of the Coast against the Spaniards in Hispaniola . Watts , who claimed authority under Lieutenant-Governor Brayne of Jamaica  --  although he had never been seen to produce any documents in support of such claim  --  had granted British colonial commissions to sundry French , Dutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtle for even a Spanish official  --  that had set eighty-odd buccaneers to kicking their lives out at the end of a hangman 's rope . Had the expedition been a success ? Everyone  --  tavernkeepers , merchants , moneylenders , pimps , whores and cutthroats  --  wereanxious to know , and so make ready a suitable welcome . To the chagrin of Cayona 's motley population the Free Guilt 's master proved to be in no great hurry to get ashore . Did this mean that disaster had befallen the raiders ? Probably . Most of the buccaneers and pirates frequenting Tortuga would , when successful , have come tearing ashore bellowing and bragging on their conquests . A stillness fell over the exAnAdmiral of the Coast 83pectant crowd . Surely it must be ill news they had aboard yonder vessel whose big green and yellow flag snapped briskly in the breeze commencing to blow over some mile and a half of sea separating Tortuga from Hispaniola . A growl of excitement rippled along the beach when into the Free Guift 's longboat tumbled a company of about fifteen men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Otherwise why should yonder seamen be wearing new silk shirts , mantles and doublets ? Ecstatic shrieks arose from the frowsy denizens of Cayona 's many brothels when vice-seared wenches espied sundry heavy cases , barrels and canvas backs being handed over the Free Guift 's rail . In the humid gloom of the guard room before the Governor 's residence Colonel Chamlett Arundel , late of the Royalist Cavalry , fingered drooping , carefully curled mustaches . His mood was sulphurous , of a piece with the near to suffocating heat . Curse old Watts and his notions of formality . Here , in this fetid stink hole of a port , he was required as Deputy-Governorto wear that same threadbare scarlet and gold coat that had graced the forecourt of Whitehall Palace . " Robert ! " the Deputy-Governor bawled over his shoulder . " You black scrapings of hell , go below and fetch me two milk punches ! " " Yassuh , Misto Cunnel , Yo ' Excellency , suh ! " " Jenkins ! " An iron-bound and nail-studded door creaked open . " Yessir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I 'll not have him boasting and spreading lies about the town until he 's presented me his report Curse your stupidity ; leave that blasted door open ! ' T is already hotter in here than the hinges of hell itself . " A sense of pleasurable anticipation , not unmixed with anxiety , seized the Deputy-Governor . Praise God , old Watts was suffering so much from the remittent fever today that his teeth chattered faster than the castanets of any Spanish harlot along the waterfront . Captain Henry Morgan , he openly liked and understood , for , despite the young Welshman 's savage truculence and fabulous excesses , the evidencesof his gentle birth remained indelible ; secretly he envied Morgan 's inflexible will-power . Of all the buccaneer captains , old or young , frequenting Tortuga , only Morgan might rightly be mentioned in the same breath as Edward Mansvelt , that wily and sagacious veteran freebooter , privateer and occasional pirate . To Arundel 's surprise he found himself getting to his feet to stand waiting behind a handsome satin wood desk Captain Bartholomew84 Cutlass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coast of Yucatan . " Odds blood , Governor ! " Morgan paused a moment , his chunky frame quite filling the low stone doorway . " I am curs 'd glad and honored to greet you . A week ago I 'd have deemed such a privilege most unlikely . " Arundel extended a liberally beringed hand . The Deputy-Governor 's pale green eyes flickered over this sturdy , bandy-legged young fellow who must be nearing the twenty-fifth year of his life . For this occasion the Free Guilt 's captain had affected a flat-topped and soft-brimmed Spanish hat which rested upon a red and yellow striped headkerchief . Morgan 's light brown , almost yellowish mustache , Arundel noticed , had grown longer and the blazing Caribbean sun had stained his neck and broad features a deep walnut brown . Dangling from the buccaneer officer 's ears glittered a pair of plain gold earrings , each set with three small rough-cut emeralds . All he wore beneath a red velvet bandolier supporting a very serviceable cutlass was a sweat-stained linen shirt . A broad and elaborately carved leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also a brace of wickedly slim boarding pistols . The two men clasped hands then , at Arundel 's waved invitation , Morgan flung himself into an armchair and thrust yellow-stockinged legs well out before him . A trifle stiffly Arundel reseated himself , then leaned forward , unable to conceal his eagerness . " Well , Harry , well ? Speak up , man ! It has n't been easy for us here in Cayona gnawing our nails and wondering how you made out . I esteem you gave the Dons a trouncing ? " Morgan 's prominent black eyes hardened and his jaw went out . " Aye , we won a victory of a sort , I suppose . " "  --  Of a sort ? You failed of taking Santiago ? " The Deputy-Governor 's voice quivered . " No . We carried out our purpose after a fashion , but God roast my butt ! ' t was the most slovenly conceived affair . " " You won some treasure ? Some slaves ? " " Aye , but less than the half of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan , he 'd learned , was ever careful of his words . Robert , the big negro , pattered in on splay , pink-soled feet to offermilk punches in goblets of massive gold . " Blood in your eye ! " Arundel grunted . " Aye , and here 's a swift return to His Royal Majesty King Charles . " Arundel smiled a wry smile . " Stab me , Harry , will you never give over that foolish dream ? " " Have you ? " the younger man challenged . " After all it 's cost you ? " A bitter laugh escaped the Deputy-Governor . " Everything but myAn Admiral of the Coast 85life went to support the Stuart cause , so for one , I have had my fill of king-making . Now , that I have my sweet Henrietta , all I crave is a fortunewon from the Dons . " Almost angrily Arundel settled back in his chair and blew from his upper lip a heavy beading of perspiration . " Besides , " he continued , " Old Man Watts and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-rooted now down yonder in Jamaica . They 're Commonwealth men through and through . " Morgan shifted his weight . " Did ye hear the good news ? " " No , we 've had no foreign intelligence in weeks . " " Last week I spoke with a Liverpool brig . Her master swore Bloody Oliver is dead at last . Seems the Roundheads are trying to hoist his son Richard up to the Lord Protector 's throne . All over Britain there are Royalist stirrings . D' you credit that ? " Wearily , Arundel shook his head . " No . I 've heard such talk the past fifteen years , but always the accursed Roundheads prevail . " Morgan gulped the last of his milk punch , crooked a forefinger at the slave and ordered a second round . Using a lace handkerchief , Arundel mopped his streaming features . " Now concerning your attack on Santiago ? We 'll consider this your official report , an you please . " He selected a sheet of foolscap and a pen from a shot glass bristling with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his belt , placed the silver-mounted pistols on the table beside him then , settling back in the chair , laid the cutlass across his lap . His eyes strayed past the gaudy figure of the Deputy-Governor to a door leading into the residence . Vainly he tried to catch the sound of Susan 's voice . Arundel said sharply , " Well , sir , what happened ? Give me a strict account , understand ? " Morgan first grinned impudently to assert his independence , then in measured but brisk tones described the buccaneer  --  for so the English termed the boucaniers  --  expedition against Santiago de Hispaniola . By a show of hands the four hundred men composing the punitive force had elected to divide themselves into four troops , each under a tried and capable captain . Besides Morgan the officers thus honored had been Captain Coon Darbraunce , Captain Humphrey Dobson and Captain Jonas Reekes . " Damme ! I know all about the start of your cruise , " Arundel broke in impatiently . " Get to the main point . How far from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or forty-five miles if you prefer it that way . " " Well ? " Imperturbably the young captain continued : " We arrived off Port o ' Plate on Palm Sunday last , and got ashore well enough , but odds blood ! 86 Cutlass Empire the other captains either would not , or could not , restrain their rogues from falling out and scurrying off to ransack every miserable hamlet we encountered on our way inland . " Thus we became delayed in re-collecting the men , and ' t was only be- cause the Governor of Santiago was fatuous enough to believe that no raiders would dare penetrate so far inland that , despite everything , our troops were able to surprise the capital city through the dawn of Holy Wednesday . " Morgan sat straighter now and began to talk faster . " We poured through the streets , shooting at anyone who durst show his nose and even surprised that pot-bellied whiskerado of a governor in his bed . Jo Reekes and Hump Dobson were all for whacking off his head on the spot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old villain to ransom . He agreed to the sum of sixty thousand pieces-of-eight as ransom for himself and all the men of Santiago . " Morgan bit his rather full nether lip . " ' T was more than we had hoped for  --  and more than we got . " While mopping the patine of sweat from his features Arundel nodded approval . " That 's good , and then what ? " " After I succeeded in persuading my co-captains that a single live prisoner was worth more than two or three dead ones  --  which to me seems obvious enough  --  the massacre was halted and we let the women and children run off into the hills . " Arundel frowned , jabbed his pen into a squat pewter inkwell shaped like a boar 's head . " Why 'd you allow ' em to escape ? " " Why , it was entirely my idea , " Morgan returned calmly . He winked at his inquisitor while a sardonic smile appeared beneath the short sun- bleached mustache . " To what lengths would a devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from I expect you know what is of custom done to unransomed male prisoners ? " " Aye , " Arundel returned . " I presume you stripped the town ? " " To the very bone , your Excellency , and especially those accursed Papist churches . " He chuckled deep in his throat . " D' you know , Arundel , ' t is a fine thing that their mode of worship calls for so many gold items in its service ? " Despite my every effort , " resumed the buccaneer , " the other captains would not keep their men in hand ; by consequence they caroused like utter fools . " Morgan 's evident disgust sent one of Arundel 's brows to lifting . What sort of buccaneer was this who spoke with contempt of hard-earned revels ? He surveyed the dark-browed figure seated with sturdy legs thrust out far before him and gripping his silver punch goblet as if he meant to crush it . " The stupid dogs would not credit that an alarm had been spread all the length of Santiago Savanna , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able-bodied Spanish had collected themselves to fall upon our plunder-laden four hundred . " " Dear God ! " Arundel burst out and his grimy jewelled fingers tightened . So this was why Morgan had come home alone ? " Had I not kept my handful of men in order , most assuredly we would have been surprised and slain . As it was , the Dons attempted to cut off our retreat . " Morgan 's voice swelled in volume and he sat forward , pounding one hand into the palm of the other . " When they burst from their ambush they outnumbered my company by three to one and had we not had so much the better of them in the nature of our weapons , we most certainly would have perished to the last man ! " Even while speaking Morgan reviewed and reaffirmed certain entries he had written into what he termed privately his " Book of Experience . " To the fact that a live prisoner was much more useful and profitable than a dead one , he had another two dicta : first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postponed until all possibilities of attackhad been removed ; second , modern and superior firearms in the hands of a few disciplined men were vastly more effective than any quantityof miscellaneous armament handled by an untrained levee en masse . " As it was , " Morgan told Arundel grimly , " the only way we saved our skins was by threatening to massacre Don Arnulfo , the Governor , and all other prisoners in our hands . " Again Morgan held out his goblet , but this time he drank more slowly . " For some reason the Dons proved fond of their fatuous Governor and certain other prisoners , so they fell back and offered us a small ransom , which in truth was about all that beautiful but poor savanna could produce . " Arundel leaned forward over the desk and drops of perspiration fell from his nose onto his writing . " So the Governor 's people made up the sixty thousand pieces-of-eight ? " A tide of dull color crept out to stain Morgan 's heavily sunburned cheeks . " The curse of Asmodeus , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest mistake of all . Had we but brought the prisoners away , we should have had those sixty thousand pieces in due course . But no , Reekes and the rest clamored for an immediate gain . As it fell out , Reekes , Darbraunceand Dobson voted to accept a beggarly forty thousand pieces of silver and let all the prisoners go , God damn it ! " Morgan jumped up and his voice made the whole stone chamber resound . " Why are they such cursed dolts as not to foresee that other Spaniards will hear of their asinine softness ? At the very least we should have kept Don Arnulfo and , after having paraded a Royal Spanish Governor through the streets of your capital , Colonel Arundel , why then we could have enslaved him till his own ransom was paid . " 88 Cutlass EmpireThe Deputy-Governor summoned a weak smile , admitted the justice of Morgan 's stand . " Sink me ! Had I commanded in full at Santiago I 'd have handled  --  matters differently . We would have taken the town and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor would we have had to count on luck to get us away with a whole hide . " A great sigh of relief burst from the glittering , scarlet clad figure . So the others had got away ! " You were saying ? " " Mark my words , Colonel , I 'll never , come hell or hangman , sail as co-captain with Reekes or Dobson again . " Arundel put his pen back into the shot glass . " Ca n't say as I disagree ; they 're brutal , callous dogs at best , and not over-blessed with wit . All the same , you had best not voice your opinion abroad . Here on Tortuga they have a thousand friends , whilst you are but new arrived among the Brethren . " Arundel smiled a flat smile to disguise the fact that he was thinking , " This fellow Morgan 's shrewd , perhaps too shrewd , and confounded im- patient to boot . ' Less he 's careful , he 's like to wake up before very long to find his gizzard 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring chickens ; besides , they 're just shrewd enough to envy Morgan 's ability whilst recognizing their own limitations . " Aloud he de- manded , " And what will be Governor Watts ' share ? " Morgan laughed harshly . " Exactly five thousand pieces-of-eight , my dear Colonel Arundel , and it might just as well have been thrice that sum . Damme , I 'm thirsty . " His manner changed , and swinging over to the doorway , he bellowed , " You guards down there ! Let my fellow pass . Fernando , come up here . " A mestizo slave , half white and half Indian , appeared , stooped low to pass the guard room door because of the small and carefully corded bale carried on one shoulder . " What 's this ? " Arundel got up , pulled the sweat-soaked fabric of his pantaloon free from his buttocks . " A few trinkets I 've fetched back for Henrietta , your lovely wife  --  and her sisters . " Arundel 's watery eyes glistened . Loot for Henrietta eventually meant loot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world of 1659 , no woman was eligible to hold property in her own right . " Hold hard , you ! " he directed , once the mestizo had commenced to untie the rawhide lashings . " Harry , why not convey gifts to a cooler spot ? Besides , the ladies will enjoy a viewing of their unwrapping . " An Admiral of the Coast 89Chapter 2 . THE DAUGHTERS OF ELIAS WATTSREGRETFULLY , SUSAN WATTS PUT ASIDE A GOWN OF TURquoise-bluesilk presented to her by Guy de Talmont , a ruffling buccaneerfrom the Vendee County of France . For all that this garment was really lovely , she did n't intend her acceptance of it to advance the cause of that boisterous and touchy young gallant one whit . In no great hurry Susan moved over to the bed , mechanically inspected the garments laid out upon its light green counterpane . Presently she picked up a pair of red silk stockings and , still walking in abstracted thoughtfulness , seated herself on the small bench before her dresser . After pulling on one stocking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under-belt through a series of eyelets sewn into the stocking top and knotted them into tidy small bows . Then holding the other stocking limp in her hand , stared unseeingly at a gilt wood sconce affixed to the far wall . So it was Harry Morgan 's vessel that had cast its anchor in the harbor this afternoon ? La ! And her brother-in-law , Chamlett Arundel , said Harry had been elected a captain  --  quite an honor for so young a man ; especially so , since his catch was near the smallest in the ever-increasing buccaneer fleet . In abrupt efficiency she smoothed her brunette hair , then stooping , tucked her feet into black satin slippers , very modish because of red , high , spool-shaped heels . She was surprised to find herself still thinking of that fiery Welshman who undoubtedly was forging to a prominent place among the captains of the Brethren . If only he were n't so handy with cutlass and pistol . Of course it had to be admitted that on both occasions when Morgan had killed he 'd been acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dumbly devoted gallant , Enoch Jackman , had got himself near to strangled at the Argus Tavern was a case in point . Susan returned to the bedside , selected a white lawn chemise and , in a supremely graceful movement , slipped it over her head . If only Dick Hurlburt were possessed of more ambition . But he was n't . Dick was just a lovable , lusty , well-built soldier fit only to breed more soldiers before getting himself killed in battle . Briefly , she considered calling Lucy to help her into her stays , but decided against it . Her waist being naturally small , she could manage alone to tighten the laces enough for so infernally hot and humid an evening . Still lost in thought , Elias Watts ' tall second daughter stepped first into a bottom petticoat of very fine white lawn , then tied on a pale pink satin90 Cutlass Empire An Admiral of the Coast 91one decorated by two deep flounces . Finally about her middle she secured a very full top petticoat of blue and gold taffety . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her thoughts raced on . Could a girl wheedle and persuade a man like Morgan to a course against his whim ? Or would she perpetually have to give in  --  as Mamma had had to Pa ? Mamma 's losing struggle against Papa 's will must have been long and bitter , for Ellen Watts had been no part of a weakling . Finally , Susan slipped on over chemise and petticoats a short-sleeved gown of green and gold brocade , then stood inspecting the completed toilet as best she might in a small , walnut-framed mirror propped upon her dressing table . It occurred to her that a man like Papa always had his own way . He had reached Barbadoes as a bound servant and had worked out his seven years ' servitude as an overseer of condemned criminals farmed out to various planters . Although only self-appointed Governor and supported only by the most tenuous of official ties with England , he was ruling Tortuga and its wicked little capital with an unflinchingand sometimes savage will . It must have been a real triumph , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a position that he could marry Ellen Potter , who hailed from Providence in the Rhode Island Plantations , amid that wilderness known as North America . To be sure , Mamma had been only a poor relationand dependent on the bounty of a wealthy aunt , yet there was no room for doubt but that Mamma 's folks had been well , if not gently , bred . Poor Mamma ! How that gaunt and determined creature had yearned just once more to see snow sifting earthwards , to hear again the northwindmoan about the caves of a log cabin . Time and again , on such a scorching day as this , Mamma had painted verbal pictures of Rhode Island for Henrietta , Lucy and herself . Susan seated herself before the little mirror and , after briskly combing her shining dark brown hair , twisted it into a little bun which , by means of a turquoise and silver bodkin , she secured at the precise center back of her head . So Harry Morgan was to call this evening ? Um . Why had he returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face she saw between two pert yellow bows set to either side of her head was that of a girl just past twenty , possessed of such strong features that most men deemed them handsome rather than pretty . The mirror also reproduced the image of a young female who knew what she intended  --  and who was determined to achieve just that . From a majolica patch box she selected , after momentary debate , a tiny black paper rose , which she wetted and stuck low on her cheek ; then , to complete her toilet , Susan groped for a small ceruss secreted behind the mirror lest Lucy help herself too liberally to the rouge itcontained . Employing the tip of a little finger , Susan tinted lips and cheeks as bright as she dared without incurring Papa 's wrath . A quick rap at the door preceded Lucy 's appearance as a smaller and blonde replica of herself . Both girls had inherited Elias Watts ' wide mouth , firm chin and long straight nose . " Get a hurry on , you vain baggage , " Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Jackman had fetched back from his last cruise . There was no doubt , Susan was deciding , that the lanky New Englanderhad fallen desperately in love with little Lucy just about as quickly as he had clapped eyes on her , and Lucy no less was taken with this soft-spoken , almost grave young man who , nonetheless , was reputed to fight against the Spaniards like a paladin in the olden legends . By the time the young ladies descended to a minute courtyard enclosed by the Governor 's residence dusk was falling and , among those few flowers growing there in a half-hearted fashion , some luciernagas were beginning to flash their tiny but surprisingly brilliant lights . Susan smiled on recognizing the seated figure of her father ; his attackof intermittent fever must have relented for he wore only a light shawl draped over his shoulders . Already enjoying the cool of the eveningbreeze were Colonel Arundel , Captain Morgan and Jackman ; all three seated in chairs of woven cane . On his knees Jackman was supporting a small wooden coffer while a bolt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . When he saw Lucy the New Englander jumped up and turned as red as any of the roses that had blossomed so well in Barbadoes . Morgan , when he saw Susan , was slower in arising , but a smile spread gradually over his face like ripples caused by a stone tossed into a mill pond and his bow was deep and not ungraceful . " At your service , Mistress Susan , and yours Mistress Lucy . " Elias Watts waved a bony and vein-corded hand towards the pair . " Ye deserve to find them gone , ye vain and lazy baggages . We 've been waitingoverlong for you lassies to primp and perfume yerselves . Henrietta should have been here long since , but since she ai n't , plagued if we will wait any longer . Come along , lads , let 's spy yer plunder . " Despite a demurely downcast gaze , Susan sensed Morgan 's eyes upon her and flushed at the strong , almost impertinent intensity of his regard . " ' T is not much , " Morgan belittled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cords and wrappings . " I fear our attack on Santiago was none-too-well executed . " A smothered gasp escaped Susan and her sister when the fading light revealed half a dozen shawls and mantillas , delicate as spider webs but bright as those humming birds which at dawn and dusk came to explore92 Cutlass Empirethe garden . The little hoard included also several small chains of silver and one of deep red gold , lying amid an assortment of bracelets , pins , and combs that proved wholly enchanting to feminine eyes . Morgan reseated himself and perhaps a trifle too casually invited , " Pray make a selection , ladies . I trust you will find something to meet your tastes . " Susan almost ran to bend over the small mound of booty , then , dark eyes dancing , she tried one after another of the gold mounted tortoiseshellcombs in her hair until she found one that suited her . To Morgan it proved significant that Elias Watts ' second daughter selected neither the largest nor the most valuable of the items of jewelry , but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty and but one article from each category . Immensely pleased , Morgan said , " And now , Mistress Lucy , it 's your turn . " Lucy shook her head and dimpled at the same time . " My thanks , CaptainMorgan . What with Henrietta 's presents and Susan 's you have alreadyproved over-generous to our family . Besides Jackman simply beamed as he opened his little coffer . While his offeringswere by no means on a par with Morgan 's yet a fine necklace of seed pearls seemed designed by nature to adorn Lucy 's small straight neck . Morgan fingered a faintly bluish chin , shot his lieutenant a quizzical look . " Odds blood ! I do n't seem to recall that necklace at the division ? " Jackman looked him straight in the eye and returned in perfect calm : " Mebbe . But no more do I recollect spyin ' yon gold and emerald bracelet . " Arundel and Watts chuckled . The light by now was poor , but Lucy could not resist draping Jackman'sbolt of red and yellow striped satin about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it . A loud knocking began at the courtyard gate . " Your Excellency ? " " That will be du Rausset , " Watts grunted . " He 's early , but you may show him in . He 's a man you should know better , Captain Morgan . Look sharp while he 's here . I 'll talk to you on this subject , later . " Presently a lieutenant of the Governor 's guard ushered in a short , powerfully built Frenchman known as Bernard Deschamps , the Sieur du Rausset . Bowing first to the Governor , he then made a most elegant leg to the two young women . " Evening , Mounseer , and what good news d'ye bring ? " The Frenchman 's teeth flashed . " None , save that two more sails have been raised . Ah , there is Monsieur le Capitaine Morgan . How fared the expedition ? " An Admiral of the Coast 93 " Fair enough , thank you . " The Welshman grinned , then added quickly , " You 've some rare fine fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tact was in order , Morgan felt , besides , he had always rather liked this energetic and very practical little man . Du Rausset looked pleased . " You are most generous to say so . I doubt not that their success was due to your excellent leadership ? " " Oh no , " said Morgan carelessly . " Your people served mostly under Darbraunce  --  did well just the same . " Arundel smiled his crooked smile at the subtle compliment and equally subtle gibe . Harry Morgan preferred to recruit his men from among the English or Dutch , yet always he took care to sign on a few carefully selected French hands . Morgan , turning aside , conducted Susan to the far end of the court . She smiled up through the gathering darkness . " How sweetly generous you have been , Harry . I wonder why ? " " You were ever in my thoughts , " he declared earnestly . " I tried tocr  --  comeacross that which might please you . " "  --  And my sisters ? La ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must n't tease for your having been very kind . My best wishes on your election to captain . Are you fated always to succeed in your ambitions ? These , " she touched the bracelet and comb , " are truly lovely . Always I 'll treasure them and your thought of me . What do you intend doing with the rest of your winnings ? " The question was so adroitly put that Morgan actually stammered . " Why , I  --  I mean to c-convert them to gold and so improve the armament of my vessel . " " You 'll not indulge in even one small carouse ? " she teased , wishing that Dick Hurlburt would get back to his guardroom instead of gloweringhere like some jealous schoolboy . " Not if you 'll grant me the favor of your charming attention . " Elias Watts ' tall , slim daughter really was handsome , resembling not a bit dear , little Anne Pruett . As he walked with Susan , Harry wondered if Anne was still wearing his wyvern ring back there in Bristol . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' grip on Tortuga ? Now , more than ever before , Morgan craved a deeper , clearer insight into the complex and ceaselessly changing undercurrents of local politics . One thing was certain ; every so often Susan 's father privately receivedintelligence brought from somewhere in fast little barca longas . On the other hand , it was whispered in Cayona that Bernard du Rausset was interviewing quite as many surreptitious couriers as Elias Watts . His informants , however , arrived largely from St. Christopher 's Island , the one , really strong outpost of French power in the Caribbean. 94 Cutlass Empire Following a slight supper of stewed kid and roast beef , the Governor invited Morgan into his cabinet . They seated themselves before a window which afforded a fine view , not only of the lights winking along the semi- circular beach of Cayona , but also of the harbor and the star-lit sea beyond . Morgan tossed down his fourth straight brandy and , perspiring heavily , opened his shirt to expose a brown hirsute chest to the faint draft . Despite a pleasurable glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of Susan 's proximity , the buccaneers ' newest captain prepared either to talk or to listen . " Yes , Harry , ' t is main good to see you back , " old Watts was drawling , his long sallow features fallen into preoccupied lines . " I 'm always relieved when an English ship returns whole . " " Here on Tortuga how greatly do the French outnumber us ? " " By between three and five to one , " the Governor returned slowly . "  --  And there 's the rub . If you add the Hollanders to the French , we are outnumbered at least seven to one , and God knows the Dutch have small cause to love us English these days . " " Why ? " " Some of the Brethren have been near as hard on the Hollanders ' ship- ping as on the Dons ' . You see , " the old man hunched forward , and his profile , picked out by the golden rays of an oil lamp , shone yellow as any doubloon , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crook , to win back Tortuga so this fellow , du Rausset , for all his guile , to me is as transparent as yonder wine goblet . " Morgan set down his brandy glass and devoted to Watts his whole at- tention . " You 're correct in that . What 's the key to the problem ? " " If only I can circumvent the Court of France , and du Rausset , ' til our power in Jamaica is more firmly established , then there 's a chance we English can cling to Tortuga  --  which is well worth hanging onto . Know why ? " " Why , for one thing , " he returned , his large dark eyes intent , " ' t is a rich , well-protected rendezvous for the Brethren ; for another , Spanish power is weakest over yonder at the western end of Hispaniola . Still more important " He broke off . " And what is more important ? " Morgan sighed , slapped away a halo of mosquitoes . " I do n't pretend to be a great seaman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tortuga and the Ile des Vaches  --  which our lads call Cow Island  --  are of such importance . " Morgan was referring , Watts knew , to an island which occupied an almost identical position as Tortuga , off the southern coast of Hispaniola . Leaning forward , elbows on knees , the buccaneer continued , slowly and thoughtfully , " Now these two islands , being so situated , dominate the Windward Channel , that principal sea passage between Hispaniola and Cuba . Being up-wind , we have the weather gauge of any ships or fleets the Dons may send direct to or from Mexico , Yucatan or Maracaibo . Our prey , in beating to windward , must await chancey and undependable breezes , whereas we stand to enjoy the almost certain propulsion of the Trade Winds . " Elias Watts ' completely hairless head inclined several times . " You 've put yer finger to it , Captain ; nothing less than a powerful fleet coming from Europe would dare attempt these straits . " " In effect , " Morgan amplified and jerked his head to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , " if England can hold the Bahamas , I3arbadoes and Jamaica in force , and retain Tortuga , we will have thrust a barrier between Spain and her colonial empire which the Dons can penetrate but rarely , and then only in great force . Am I correct ? " " Aye . " Elias Watts turned , deliberately surveyed his companion . " Damn my eyes , Harry , but ye'r fashioned of somewhat better stuff than the rest of these ruffians I rule over . Aye , you have vision of a sort . " A shrilling of crickets and the chirping of great bats feasting on insects attracted by the light were filling the night when a great outcry , quickly followed by the shrill , hysterical screaming of a woman , floated up to the battlements from the beach . There followed the crashing report of a pistol shot , another , and yet another . Morgan paid the racket not the least attention . " In other words , Your Excellency , what you would convey is you must reinforce the English element here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly , " Watts qualified . " Despite everything , the French Brethrenremain well disposed towards us . They hate and fear the Spaniards even more greatly than we . No , Harry , England 's too weak and France is too unconcerned , so , if the Spanish power is to be defied , ' t is the Brethrenmust do it ! " " You 're in error there ! " Morgan shook his head . " All they 've a mind for is revenge , plunder and carousal . " Elias Watts ' haggard countenance formed a weary smile . " I fear you are but too right . I thank you for your report . Arundel says ' t was most lucid and pertinent . And now where are you off to ? " " The beach , " Morgan returned carelessly . " I would learn more of Mounseer du Rausset ; the fellow intrigues me . " The Governor , however , held up a restraining hand and cleared his throat . " Do you perchance recall the purchase of a certain commission against the Spaniards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ten per cent of your winnings . After all , I do not write letters-of-marque for the practice of penmanship . " Morgan grinned . " Why , sir , your share sails aboard that French frigate we  --  er  --  borrowed ere we sailed . You might remember this , too , and think on it . Had I been in full command against Santiago your share would have been thrice of what you 'll receive . " In sudden rage Watts jumped up , towered a full head above the stocky young Welshman . " Take care , Harry Morgan , you over-reach yourself ! God rot your arrogant guts ! You plume yourself on greater ability than you possess . You make great promises " Give me command and you 'll see ' em fulfilled to the letter , " the young Welshman snapped . " You know damned well I ca n't appoint you to command " True , but you can throw your weight in my favor at an election . " " Damned if I will , " snarled Watts . " You brag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially among the French . " " So you 'll not support me as commander on an expedition ? I 'd have thought better of your wit . " He was wrong to have spoken , that Morgan realized as quickly as the words had escaped his lips . Watts emitted a sardonic laugh . " Indeed ? Then I 'm overwhelmed with chagrin . I 'll have you know , sir , that as captains go , you are as green as grass ' round a dung heap . I 'll support you when you fetch into Cayona some ships of real size and worth . And now , get out of here ! " Enoch Jackman long since had reeled in to sprawl , snoring like a dozen fog horns , across the untidy , earthen-floored bedroom , but Captain Achille Tribitor , master of a brigantine just returned from a moderately fortunate cruise off the coast of Cuba , continued singing louder than ever . More than half drunk , he plucked at a Portuguese guitar and happily serenaded various gecko lizards reposing themselves against the palmthatchroof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he sat glowering at an earthenware jar of fiery rum which had cost him the exorbitant sum of two pistoles ; the stuff was n't worth even a tenth of that sum but , in Cayona , one had to expect such brigandage . The more he considered old Watts ' contemptuous dismissal of his plea for even a small independent command , the more resentful he grew . Not one of the other captains had led his men so successfully that his command had not been reduced by a single casualty . " The Devil fly off with that old wrinkle-belly , " he gloomed . " If only he was n't Susan 's father Having reached a final decision , Morgan refused to stew longer in the bitter juice of disappointment , so gave attention to Tribitor for the Frenchman 's voice held a soothing quality . " ' T is an elegant tenor you sing , " he smiled . " Can you follow this ? " A Rosetree I did plant Beneath the garden mould And in the early morningA blossom there , dera dera la @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . " And in the early morningA blossom there beholdI said , Oh Rosetree mineToo soon dost thou dera dera la la Too soon dost thou unfold . ' " " Magnifique ! We are as tuneful as a pair of linnets . No ? " Ma foi , Harry , " said he in all but unaccented English , " many a lusty drinker I have met , yet by your stature they were as mere children . Surely old Bacchus himself once perched in your family tree ? " Ready good nature mercurially restored , Morgan bellowed with laughter at the vision of a pagan god perched among the elms shading the old walled farm in Llanrhymny . He remembered now of whom the " Red Rose against the Gray Wall " reminded him . Susan ! By God  --  was it not utterly amazing that so charming and delicate a maid could thrive on the roistering coast of this barbaric island  --  like a beautiful flower on a dung heap ? Rose ! That 's what Susan was  --  a rose . Morgan smiled to himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After the soul-dulling brutalities , the crass savagery , the unbelievable obscenities he had experienced the past three years , her presence was like a long cool draught to a sailor perishing of thirst . Tribitor struck a loud chord on his guitar . " One observes , " he remarked , " that you , mon ami , are at heart a poet and a great trouveur . Surely the angels in le bon Dieu 's heaven must be envious . " " Aye , I 'm a poet , " Morgan admitted . A rare , a supremely wonderful , inspiration was kindling his imagination . What of that golden rose from the bishop 's palace ? True , he had been saving that superb example of the goldsmith 's art for an especially auspicious occasion , but by God he was n't going to wait ! Tonight , yes , this very night , gallantly , humbly and devotedly , he would toss his golden rose through Susan 's window . Rising a trifle unsteadily , he bade Jackman a cheerful goodnight , then rowed himself out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch lay at anchor barely fifty yards offshore with every sable outline of her hull , spars and rigging faithfully mirrored by the polished jet surface of Cayona harbor. 98 Cutlass Empire Chapter 3 . THE GOLDEN ROSE IT WAS NEARING ONE OF THE MORNING WHEN , ONCE more , coral sand yielded under Harry Morgan 's bare feet ; purposely he had left his shoes aboard the Free Guilt . The stars faintly outlined , one hundred and fifty feet above the beach , that modest four-gun fort Elias Watts and his followers had constructed . Long since , Morgan 's trained eye had surveyed , and found very difficult , the approaches to Governor Watts ' diminutive but effective stronghold . With phosphorous gleaming yellow-green about his ankles , Morgan waded along the shore until he found himself below the westward face of the crag upon which Susan slept . Panting , he craned his neck upwards grateful that the effects of the rum he 'd had were beginning to wear off . Aye . ' T would be a rarely romantic gesture  --  that of tossing this little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed to be unapproachable by any save the single route  --  which required the lower- ing of an iron stair at one stage , imagine her bewilderment , her curiosity , and her delight when , with tomorrow 's light , she would behold this deli- cate golden flower glowing on her bedroom floor . " To thee I come , Susan , " he muttered , then thrust the rose between his teeth that he might better tighten that broad leather belt which sup- ported a short-bladed dagger above the curve of his buttocks . The rocks , at first slippery from sea growth , presently gave way to others gritty with dried sea salt . They proved still so hot that , almost im- mediately , perspiration commenced to run in rivulets over his forehead and down his back . Soon he espied the head and shoulders of a sentinel silhouetted against the purple-black heavens . By God ! Were he in command of the castle 's guard he 'd surely see that sleepy rascal well flogged . He was actually dozing up there in his corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown shirt and gray breeches hacked off at knee length , Morgan knew he was n't easy to see . Panting , hooking fingers and toes into a series of minute fissures and ledges , he worked his way up , up , until the dim froth of the sea below appeared immeasurably distant . By the time he slid a cautious but violently quivering hand over the parapet his head had quite cleared and he was fighting to draw his breath around the cool stem of the golden rose without making panting noises . Ha ! He rolled over the parapet and dropped into a nest of shadows as silently as a prowling cat over a back yard fence . Trembling gently from his exertions he lay still , not twenty feet above the dim gleam wrought by the stars on that sentinel 's musketoon . Long since he had ascertained that Susan 's window lay the last in a row of three identical openings let into the seaward face of Elias Watts ' sturdy stone stronghold . It proved no trick at all to dodge , with ferret-like speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused , with lifting heart , beneath Susan 's heavily barred window . Praise God that it was not the custom in these parts to employ glass  --  only jalousies and iron barsandtonight Susan , sweet , adorable Susan , had left her lattice raised . Taking a firm grip on the window bars , Morgan set his shoulders and , very slowly and cautiously , hoisted his body upward until he could see into the little chamber and smell a faint but definite suggestion of perfume . To his astonishment the bed , a small , narrow affair , was empty . No matter ; she would find the rose come morning . After pressing the cool metal leaves to his lips Harry Morgan reached through the bars and tossed in his gift . A pang , as sharp as that of an arrow piercing his body , shot through him at the sound of a man 's voice , saying , " God above ! What was that ? " Instantly , came Susan 's velvety soft voice : " Sh-h , darling , someone will hear you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresser . " Then he saw them sitting embraced on a settee  --  a white garment of some description lay on the floor beside them . " But I heard a noise , " he heard the man 's hoarse whisper insist . " Nothingwould blow over  --  there 's no wind . " " In God 's name , be quiet , Dick , and go quickly . " Susan sounded really alarmed . " If Papa should find us Oh , get you gone , my love . " Without any conscious effort on his part , Morgan 's fingers relaxed and he dropped back a short distance onto the dew-drenched flooring of the parapet  --  but his soul was plunging into far greater depths . Chapter 4 . STEEL ON THE BEACHBY NOON OF THE THIRD DAY FOLLOWING HARRY Morgan 's return to Tortuga , Cayona 's small but excellent blue-green harbor teemed with activity . Not only had the four original vessels comprisingthe expedition against Hispaniola made port but , anchored among them , rocked a trio of prizes : a galleass , a buss , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over six tons ' burden , but nonethelessthey constituted evidence of another victory for the Brethren of the Coast . The swaggering victors of Santiago de Hispaniola , cursing loudly , had100 Cutlass Empireto wait their turn in patronizing the village 's few taverns and ordinaries , eager to pay as much as three golden doubloons for a single coconut shell of well-watered rum . While these ragged and shaggy bull seals guzzled and rutted , the captainsof the Brethren , to the number of nearly twenty , at the Governor 's invitation , collected beneath a well-stained crimson awning set up by Elias Watts ' men on a wide white beach below the fort . Certainly they constituted as ferocious , crafty and wholly abandoned a set of seafarers as the World yet had beheld . Their costumes were as varied and garish as the plumage of so many toucans , parrots and peacocks . For the most part their raiment was disgustinglyfilthy , torn , stained and neglected ; the ruins of magnificent Mechlin or Bruges lace hung in grotesque festoons from many a pair of sunburned shoulders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this display of tawdry splendor and affected plain blue , green or white shirts and cool linen pantaloons . Almost without exception these corsairs wore long rat-tailed mustaches , generally supplemented by ragged and uncombed beards . Most , for the sake of coolness , had had their heads shaved and wore scarves to protect their scalps . Among them moved Henry Morgan , his head throbbing like one of those drums which the Carib Indians still sounded on occasion . He glowered upon a wide and elaborately carved table before which was arrangeda row of small , iron-clasped chests , all under the guard of a quartet of buccaneers . The latter stood fingering their pistol butts , when they were n't spitting onto the sand or surveying , in open curiosity , so notable a corsair as swarthy , beetle-browed Pierre LeGrand , the very mention of whose name caused a terror-stricken panic along the entire length of the Mosquito Coast . Even less prepossessing of appearance was Michel le Basque who forcefully suggested an ape because of short , bandy legs and enormously long arms swinging loose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jet eyes glittered with an almost reptilian brilliance . In striking contrast was that towering blond giant of a Dutchman who had selected the cognomen of Roche Braziliano , for all that he was no more Brazilian than Turk . He kept running very small and pale blue eyes over his fellow captains and pulling at a nose , flattened and shapeless , amid the mahogany and scar-seamed expanse of his face . Very different in build and bearing was the mysterious Sieur de Montbarsof Languedoc , here known as " the Exterminator . " He showed his noble origin in the delicate lineament of features originally handsome but grown harsh and marred by vicious lines drawn , no doubt , by that ferocious hatred he entertained for all Spaniards . Alone of the assembled officers he appeared to have taken pains about his appearance for theAn Admiral of the Coast 101ruse-point lace dripping from his cuffs was spotless as was the delicately embroidered lawn collar arranged over a rich , green velvet jacket . Disdainingthe heavy hanger or cutlass favored by a majority of his peers , this renegade nobleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pommel of which a huge ruby glowed bright as a live coal . Morgan addressed Jackman standing in uneasy silence by his side . " Aside from Reekes , Dobson and Jack Morris " Which is he ? " " The red-bearded rogue with the touch of St. Anthony 's fire on his cheek  --  an able leader so they say . Pray God ' t is true  --  so far we 've precious few Englishmen present . " Jackman treated his companion to a covert glance . What had come over him during the past few days ? He could only conjecture since , wisely , he had refrained from making inquiries . Standing there under a scarlet canopy , Morgan gradually came to realize that seldom , if ever , had congregated in one place so many celebrated  --  andinfamous  --  leaders among the Confederated Brethren of the Coast . Yonder , swaggering up from his jolly boat , strode that appalling sadist Jean David Nan , otherwise 1'Olonnais . Yves Thibault  --  he who had murderedLevasseur , Watts ' predecessor as Governor  --  squatted on bare heels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black-nailed forefinger . The only important captains not on hand were John Davis , the Scourge of the Floridas , and that crafty , stout old Dutchman , EdwardMansvelt . As in Bristol at the council before Michell Measey 's treachery , Morgan experienced a sudden humility . Gathered here were near two dozen veteran corsairs , privateers and freebooters ; captains of proven courage , resourcefulness and ability . No wonder Elias Watts had jeered at his requestfor a command . A murmer of curiosity , not unmingled with respect , arose when the governor stalked in , supported by a lieutenant and a squad from the castle guard . Standing behind the table Susan 's father looked weary and withered despite a gorgeous self-designed uniform of orange and blue satin . " Once more I bid you well come to Cayona , my friends and captains of the Confederacy . " A secretary in a grimy white coat pulled out Watts ' chair and as soon as the Governor had seated himself some of the captains plunked themselvesdown on the sand , but the majority remained standing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced , " therefore let us not delay . First , we will hear the report of Captain Reekes concerning the recent descent upon Hispaniola. " 102 Cutlass EmpireReekes slouched forward , a towering , black-haired figure lacking the tops to both ears since years earlier he had been cropped , branded and transported to Barbadoes in expiation of some minor felony . The Englishmanmade a striking figure garbed as he was in a garish yellow satin coat , orange vest , and bright blue hole-filled stockings . His was a curt , essentiallyaccurate account of the intaking of Santiago de Hispaniola . He did not dwell , however , on that indiscipline and indecision which , so Morgan claimed , had halved the loot . " Come out , you gallows-bait , with that tally . " Reekes beckoned forward a gap-toothed fellow clutching a handful of papers in a heavily tattooed hand . " There , Yer Excellency , is yer reckoning , sir , and yonder "  --  Reekes pointed to one of the chests , " is yer tenth share of the total . " Lean , fever-ravaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Before we take count of this revenue , Captain , pray recite us a statement of your losses . " All present eyed Reekes . Loss must always be weighed against profit and the result enhanced a captain 's reputation  --  or ruined his chances of recruiting a first-rate crew for his next venture . The Englishman cleared his throat and his scarred ears went red . " For the First Company , led by myself , nine men slain and half as many injured . " " What about you , Dobson ? " " I had ill luck , " grumbled that captain . " For all that I led my men  --  mostly French  --  with care , but fearing nothing  --  I lost fourteen killed and twenty-three suffered wounds . " "  --  And you , Mounseer Darbraunce ? " Coon Darbraunce , a tall , broad-shouldered Breton , looking more English than any of the Englishmen present , glowered about before makingreply as if to warn that any criticism would be rewarded with violence . " Was it my fault the camp was surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Your loss ? Come , state it . " Arundel was inexorable . " Grace to the inattention of Captain Reekes ' men , my company suffered a loss of thirteen killed and twenty-one wounded . " A deep frown drew four parallel creases across Elias Watts ' forehead , Leadership indeed must have been quite as bad as Morgan had stated , " And you , Captain Morgan , what was your loss ? " " None killed , " the Welshman stated in a clear , loud voice , " and but nine slightly wounded . " Darbraunce squared his massive shoulders , snorted and turned towards the other French buccaneers . " Is it not easy to determine whose company did the real fighting , mes amis ? Figurez-vous , our so-brave British friends , under the heroic Capitaines Morgan and Reekes , suffered the loss of but nine killed and fourteen wounded , whereas we French have lost twentyAnAdmiral of the Coast 103seven dead and forty-four injured . " The huge golden hoops let into his ears flashed to the violence of the gesture with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's table . Reekes wheeled on Darbraunce . " By God , I 'll ram that foul lie back down yer filthy gullet ! " Using the butt of a heavy holster pistol , Watts hammered for order and his guards handled their arquebuses . " Silence ! Silence ! Ye 're remindedthat no quarrelling in Council is the custom of the Coast . " Despite Jackman 's restraining hand , Morgan started forward , fixed on Darbraunce a level stare . " And why did I suffer no men slain ? Because , despite the negligence of Jo Reekes ' company , my men were alert , fairly sober and had kept their powder dry , so , when the Spaniards attacked , we were ready . Since my co-captains seem to have over-looked the fact , " he added grimly , " I 'll inform you all that it was my men who delivered the charge which drove away the enemy . " " Aye , " Reekes rumbled , staring belligerent and red-eyed on Darbraunce , " and that 's no less than the truth . Half o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't able to rise . " Among the French buccaneer captains arose an ominous undertone which was swelled to a roar by the murderer Thibault . Sneered he , " Does the valorous Captain Morgan doubt the valor of the French arms ? " " Damn your ugly eyes , Thibault , I implied nothing of the sort , " Morgan roared above the increasing clamor . " I merely pointed out that my company suffered such small loss simply because I led the men the way they should have been led . I saw to it that my orders were carried out . " Before the Frenchman could reply , Colonel Arundel , standing aloof and a trifle disdainful in his scarlet coat at the Governor 's right , signalled a drummer who immediately beat such a loud , long roll that all voices were drowned out . Watts jumped up . " Next man speaks in a quarrelsome vein I 'll see clapped into my dungeon ! If we aim to accomplish anything for the Confederacy ' gainst the Spanish we must act in harmony . Arundel , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old man 's shrewd , " Morgan noted . " ' T is a most effective maneuver , this beating of the drum , then distracting these stupid butchers with a sight o ' some plunder . " Those corsairs in thick ranks about the Governor 's awning drew closer to watch two of Reekes ' men pick up a casket . A resounding shout arose when one of the bearers threw off the catch and there was spilled onto the carpet a scintillating , gleaming , dancing mound of treasure . Necklaces , brooches , finger rings , jewelled crosses , goblets , plates and altar ornamentsbecame heaped into a small but radiant pile. 104 Cutlass EmpireA sigh of excitement arose when the two buccaneers , their cutlasses sticking up behind them like the tails of contented dogs , bent to open the third and largest of the chests . Out of it tumbled near a dozen plates and as many cruets fashioned of solid gold . Narrowly Morgan watched Watts ' expression , and decided that if theold man was not satisfied at least he was not seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the revenue collected andtransferred to my strong room . " Once the loot had been removed , Arundel motioned forward a pair of clerks and handed the Governor of Tortuga a sheaf of papers darkly inscribed with flowing script . " Captains and Brethren of the Confederacy , through the power vested in me by His Excellency , William Brayne , Lieutenant-General and Governor of Jamaica "  --  here and there a faint snicker at such crass pretentiousnessmade itself heard  --  " I am prepared to receive applications for privateer commissions against  --  ha-hrrumph !  --  the enemies of the Commonwealth of Great Britain in particular , and belligerent nations in general . " At once the more impatient captains hurried towards the Governor 's desk , but Arundel , cursing sulphurously , pushed them into line . The Sieur de Montbars , in a ferocious calm , requested British authority to attack the Captaincy-General of Nicaragua . Braziliano , his English thick and garbled by a fearful Dutch accent , demanded a commission against the Spanish in New Granada . The granting of commissions proved a lengthy business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed upon , as well as the amount of stores , canvas , powder , shot and small arms . Watts and Arundel , his son-in-law , would supply to each vessel . Susan 's father was never ready to accept the short end of a bargain . Consequently the sun was nearing its zenith before Morgan and Jackman , as his lieutenant , at length found themselves standing before the table desk . How much might the old man suspect of his demure-appearing daughter 's peccadilloes ? " How dare you cause dissension in Council ? " rasped the Governor . " Because I dare to tell the truth and I ai n't frightened of the toughest French blackguard you encourage here . " " Let be , " Jackman whispered over Morgan 's shoulder . " Put a check on that damned hot temper of yours . " Arundel intervened , summoning his crooked , meaningless smile . " Now then , Harry , where are you for ? " " The south coast of Cuba , " Morgan returned evenly ; although he had not the least intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his intentions , the better . An Admiral of the Coast 105 " The south coast of Cuba  --  where ? " Watts ' long , yellow teeth glinted . " No particular point . What I intend is a cruise of opportunity , Your Excellency . " Damn the old pinch-penny ! An instant later Morgan perceivedthat he had misjudged Susan 's father , for he turned , whispered something into the ear of the clerk crouched on his right . The secretary scribbled a few lines , then presented the parchment for Watts ' seal and signature . " My thanks . " As Morgan bent forward , Watts tipped him the faintest suggestion of a wink , at the same time muttering , " Good luck , and a rich and speedy return . " " I 'll be back , sir , and deep-laden , too . " In turning away it occurred to Morgan that Elias Watts had reproved him merely as a mode of mollifying the French . By a covert inspection of his commission Morgan was delighted to read that , during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Crown of Spain wherever he listed . " Which may be all very fine , " he reflected , " so long as old Watts retains power , but should the French take over , what then ? " Jackman gripped his elbow . " Let 's stand away from here . Me , I do n't favor the looks of yonder Frenchies . Judas Iscariot ! Ye stung ' em too bloody hard with yer gab . When will ye learn to bridle yer tongue ? " " I 'll speak my mind whenever I 've truth to tell , " Morgan insisted . " But you 're right , Enoch , we 'd best leave while opportunity offers . " Morgan 's head still was splitting from the effects of too much raw rum gulped in an effort to assuage wounded pride  --  also a mordant contempt for his own susceptibility . He and Jackman started down a noisome little alley . But it was already too late . Quite suddenly the passage had becomechoked by a dozen ominous figures in gaudy rags . A few paces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carrying the blood of many another man on his head . The buccaneer 's vicious , disease-splotched features were twisted into a menacing grimace . " Mes congratulations , Monsieur le Capitaine , " he drawled . " One observes that Harree Mor-gan is far braver in lying about his friends than at fighting against our enemies on Hispaniola . " Jackman saw his captain 's shoulder muscles tighten as he called out to Thibault in a low and deadly voice that carried the whole length of the beach , " Of course , stabbing a friend in the kidneys is a nobler sport . " Doors slammed back and half-naked harlots came running out of their dens , while men dropped whatever they were doing and hurried up . Words spoken in such tones usually preluded more or less sanguinary entertainment . " You lie ! " Thibault 's bloated and scabrous features contracted . " A106 Cutlass Empiremaggot , feasting on a festering carcass , is pleasanter to my sight than such as you . " Still making no move toward his cutlass ' grip , Morgan plowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he wanted everyone possible to witness what was about to happen . Whether he killed the Frenchman , or died in the attempt , the population of Cayona must see and remember this moment on the trampled sand separating hovels and beached small craft . He narrowed his eyes to accustom them to the blinding glare . A good thing Thibault was wearing so vivid a scarlet shirt . " Now that you 've done yapping fit to please the bitch that bore you , " Morgan kicked off his shoes  --  no use granting Thibault the advantage of bare feet  --  " suppose you try to bite as well as bark ? " A few paces back , Jackman bit his lip . Of course Harry must know that Thibault was no empty braggart but a tricky fighter , master of a dozen ruses which had preserved his life to the regret of all too many of Cayona 's inhabitants . Thibault was a big man , by half a head taller than Morgan and dangerous because of his wiry build and long reach and quick , tawny eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast , for his arms were blued with tattooing typical of that coast . Jauntily , the Frenchman shook greasy black locks over hairy shoulders and advanced towards a circle formed by an ever-increasing throng of buccaneers . Also moving forward , Morgan snapped , " Jackman , have my gig manned . Curse you ! Do as I direct ! " A wild clamor arose ; by now nearly a hundred spectators of both sexes and many nationalities had collected . " Hold ! " Bartolomeo Portugucs , the Dutchman , his scar-seamed featuresalight , burst a path through the crowd croaking , " Stand aside . Ho ! So it 's you , Morgan ? In trouble again ? Corbleu ! You deserve it , but blast my halo , I 'll serve ye interest . Stand back , you descendants of unclean creatures ! No interference of the antagonists , " he demanded . " Ready ? " Yves Thibault made a spectacular business of flexing the blade of a heavy Spanish sword , Toledo forged and , near its tip , razor sharp on both sides . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of topazes set at either end of the weapon 's cross guard . Through the heavy cotton thread of his stockings , Morgan worked his toes , tried to get the feel of this treacherously infirm sand . Across shimmeringheat currents he saw Portugucs bring his plumed hat swinging downwards at the same time shouting , " Allez ! " For only a second did Thibault and the Welshman circle , their weapons extended to half-arm 's length , then Morgan leaped in , the shorter , heavier blade of his cutlass licking out towards that glowing red shirt with the speed of a serpent 's tongue . An Admiral of the Coast 107Derisive laughter escaped Thibault , as in his turn he delivered a ferociouslunge in tierce , then aimed a whistling cut at Morgan 's head that missed the Welshman 's nose by the thickness of a moth 's wing . In that instant Morgan perceived that if this battle were to be resolved on the basis of swordsmanship , pure and simple , he stood no chance whatsoever . Therefore , he wasted no breath in outcry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amazing series of blows so powerfulthat Thibault 's steel was offered no opportunity to do more than avert sudden death . The onlookers , crouching , kneeling or standing in the pitiless sunlight , watched the Welshman advance by sheer weight of blows , and bellowed their excitement . Again and again Morgan felt his wrist jar as his cutlass ' blade impacted against the bravo 's sword . " Drive in ! " he heard a desperate inner chorus warn . " Ease up and you 're done for . " Now Morgan began to breathe in sobbing gasps , but all the same he allowed Thibault , that excellent swordsman , no opportunity to regain balance and so launch an attack of his own . That these tactics could not be pursued much longer , Morgan needed no warning . Frothy spittle was spraying from his lips and the muscles of his sword arm hurt like so many red-hot wires . Shoulders bunched , he swung , willing his steel to drive past that baffling , shimmering barrier presented by Thibault 's blade . Sheer power beat aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus allowing the Welshman 's cutlass opportunity to bite deep into the base of Thibault 's grimy neck and so release a spray of bright arterial blood . Seemingly smitten with paralysis , Thibault swayed an instant , then , amid the excited screams from the onlookers , tottered a step backward his tawny eyes grown perfectly round . " Here 's for ye ! " Morgan guessed that his enemy must already be dying , but drove his cutlass point deep , deep into the center of that glaring red silk shirt . Making strange gabbling noises , Levasseur 's murderer slumped onto the blood-spattered sand with the limpness of a marionette whose supportingstrings have been snipped through . Looking simply gigantic , the Frenchman lay on his back , quivering and digging futile fingers into the sand . Panting heavily , Morgan glared about ; in Cayona one never knew what next to expect during such an affair  --  then he planted a foot on his enemy 's chest and , with back muscles bunching , jerked free his weapon . Once , twice , he swung the cutlass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimming its blue-white surface and to disconcert possible enemies . " A-anyone else , ready t-to debate English c-courage ? " Nobody present ever forgot that look of indescribable menace. 108 Cutlass EmpireNo one spoke but Bartolomeo Portugues , more simian of appearance than ever , as he came over to shake the victor 's hand . " Corbleu , friend ' Arry ! You ' ave the strength of a bull and the courage of a tiger . But , " he lowered his voice , " you ' ad better leave for your sheep before one of Darbraunce 's cutthroats winds up ' is crossbow and lets you ' ave a painfulleetle steel quar-rel t'rough the gots ! " Chapter S. CARIBBEAN SEAAS SAILING MASTER OF THE FREE GUIFT  --  A PRETENTIOUS title , indeed , for the navigator of a seven-ton catch  --  Jackman usually lingered beside the helmsman , a huge blue-black negro possessed of the fine knack for keeping the sails filled and the catch steady upon her course . Odd , even after all this time , Henry Morgan seemed yet unable fully to comprehend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which composed the Caribbean . Why , a vessel could cruise for a week on end and never raise another sail , let alone sight an island . The land , too , was very empty  --  they found so very many silent and quite uninhabited islands , cays and islets . Perhaps that was what was depressing Harry ? Leaning on the Free Guilt 's scarred and ill-painted rail , Jackman spat resoundingly at a school of porpoises frolicking along off the catch 's beam . No more could he guess what had chanced the night after their return to Cayona . Since then , there had appeared in Morgan 's manner a certain cynicism and bitterness which , heretofore , had been lacking . He 'd be bound if Susan Watts had n't had something to do with it . Harry , of course , had acted uncommon sweet on old Elias Watts ' second daughter , just as he , himself , had grown almighty fond and tender over pretty , kitten-like Lucy . The mate stared at the bright blue horizon and a great wall of woolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yellow and gray . Would he ever hold Lucy in hiarms again ? He vowed that he would , even if it meant splitting up with Harry . He turned to let the morning sun warm the small of his back , thinking that his shares from just a few fat prizes taken on this cruise should set him up well enough to warrant his making a bid for Lucy 's small soft hand . By God , they 'd certainly beat out of Cayona harbor just in time since 1'Olonnois , that half-insane monster , in addition to a majority of the French captains , had elected to interpret Thibault 's death an affront toAn Admiral of the Coast 109their origins  --  for all that they had foresworn nationality on " passing the tropic . " The catch 's present course , he could tell , would fetch her deep into the lovely , but very dangerous , Gulf of Campeche , that favorite cruising ground for freebooters of all origins . Just what did Harry contemplate ? A lively uneasiness entered Jackman 's mind ; there was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accomplish with her pitiful battery of four demi-culverins and her complement of twenty-eight officers , boys and men . The catch was sailing so easily nothing served to interrupt Jackman 's reverie so he found himself wondering why , although the captain had begged , stolen or bought up every chart and logbook he could find , his mind continually ran on land , rather than sea , tactics ? Let any sea-rover mention having visited the Tierra Firma  --  as the Spaniards termed the American Continent proper  --  then Morgan would hearken as eagerly as any youth to his sweetheart 's praise . Then what a volley of questions would follow  --  the answers to which Morgan either wrote down in his crabbed , laboring script or committed to memory . Lips pursed in unhappy speculation , Jackman 's eyes absently followed the flight of some lovely blue and silver flying fishes ; how gracefullythey skittered out of the crest of a blue-backed roller , fluttered on gauze-like wings perhaps fifty or a hundred yards then plunged back into the sea . Lucifer 's bones ! Twenty-eight men formed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were either decrepit or not yet possessed of full growth . For over a fortnight the Free Guift plowed on and on . Sailing steadily to the north-northwest , she rode down great patches of Sargasso weed , bright yellow against that glowing deep blue peculiar to the Gulf of Campeche . Always two look-outs straddled the catch 's miniature cross-'trees , eager to win that extra share promised to him who should first sight a prize . For the men crowded into the little vessel it was more than lucky that the weather continued fair . Barely fifty feet in length at her waterline , the Free Guift had been decked over for only the after third of her hull . By consequence the buccaneers slept and performed natural functions whenever and wherever they could . Food was cooked wheneversome matelots felt hungry enough to kindle a little fire in the depths of a cast-iron cauldron floored with sand . On this spring day of 1659 , Henry Morgan was beginning to worry over his vessel 's water supply ; a calm of three days ' duration had used up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stripped to a pair of thin blue and white striped cotton pantaloons , pistol belt , and wearing his110 Cutlass Empireinevitable yellow and green headkerchief , Henry Morgan climbed into the main shrouds and lingered there , broad bare toes hooked securely over the ratlines . During the past two weeks not a few doubts had resolved themselves and even more resolutions were adopted in his mind . Although it would be uphill work for so poor a student as himself , he intended to master both the French and Spanish languages . Such an advantage he must have if ever he were to obtain an ascendancy over the Confederacy of the Brethren ; it was essential , too , that he be on good terms with the most numerousnationality among them . Yes , he must learn to understand French nature , to appreciate their strengths and to allow for their weaknesses . The telling use of French ships and man-power would go a long way toward realizing certain majestic plans he was formulating . So long as Jamaica remained in the grip of Parliament , that island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of munitions , would remain forbidden to him quite as firmly as Barbadoes , the only British possession of any strength in the Western Ocean . Firmly , Morgan wrestled with , and conquered , a sudden desire to down a coconut shell of rum and water . He would have to watch himself in that direction ; rum was mainly responsible for most of that mighty injudicious talk of which he h , ad divested himself on Tortuga . It was a comfort , though , to have made up his mind about females and their importance in his life . Out upon the lot of ' em ! With the exception of dear little Anne back there in Bristol , not one of that winsome sex was seriously to be reckoned on . Clinging there in the rigging with the morning wind beating about his muscular chest , he rehearsed once more tenets fast becoming engrained into his nature : Completely trust no one , keep a shut mouth concerning plans of campaign ; maintain essential discipline . That which he most sorely required in order to advance those grandiose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship and more followers , many more . His crew must he collated in the hundreds rather than by tens . Perspective lent by this generous distance from Tortuga disclosed to his fascinated gaze a potential power inherent in the Confederacy . Even a fool could see that the concerted might of the Brethren thus far had been ill-applied , squandered in small-scale , badly-planned raids . But suppose the buccaneers served under one commander ? Seven thousand of them ! His heart leapt . Such a force , disciplined by fear and spurred on by the promise of undreamed-of riches , should be able to accomplish almost any ambition . Morgan , by now , had learned that the Spanish King 's forces garrisoningthe Americas were somewhat over-extended , but still dangerous asAn Admiral of the Coast 111torpid adders . Why would it not be possible to amputate , one by one , the sprawling limbs of this Iberian colossus ? More earnestly than ever Morgan found himself curious to learn about the enemy 's way of living . What a priceless advantage to know their customs , just when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how these were armed and what tactics they were likely to employ . Even to its least detail , he must learn the workings of the Spanish Colonial governments . For instance , to what degree were Presidents , Captains-General and Royal Governors bound by orders issued through the Holy Office of the Inquisition ? Wise enough to smile upon his soaring imagination , Morgan stared down upon the cramped and oddly-contorted figures of his crew , for the most part still dozing upon the catch 's ballast . How desperately few they numbered . Trouble arose when , in the early afternoon , the catch raised the dull brown sails of a galliot , undoubtedly Spanish and a fair-sized vessel . Even Jackman wanted to take her . " God 's blood , Harry ! " he raged at Morgan standing stolid and powerfulat the break of the quarter deck . " We can outsail and have her within the hour . " " Aye , we can take her beyond any doubt , " Morgan replied for the benefit of the ragged and deeply sunburned buccaneers crowding about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her decks swarm. " "  --  And what o ' that ? " roared Judson . " Ai n't we took bigger craft nor her and with fewer hands ? " Quite deliberately Morgan 's prominent dark eyes sought the speaker . " True enough . But I intend to carry a much bigger and richer vessel . I 'll not allow any of you to get killed or wounded in the boarding of anything less . Silence , you lousy dogs ! You 'll find me anxious enough to call away boarders when we sight the ship I want ! " " But , Cap'n , " a middle-aged seaman wearing a wide , half-healed scar to remind him of Santiago objected , " we 're short o ' water . " " There 's enough for three more days , " Morgan snapped . " We sail nearer to the coast every hour . Enough of this ! " Though the hands , bored by long inaction , grumbled , muttered and scowled , they subsided and were glad of it when , at ten of the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ho ! " Moving in cat-like agility , Morgan swarmed up to the main crosstree , carrying a brass-bound spyglass tucked into his belt beside the never absent pair of French pistols . From below the crew watched Morgan , black hair flying free , arms and112 Cutlass Empire An Admiral of the Coast 113legs braced against the motion of the mast , swing slowly back and forth , back and forth , against the blinding blue-white glare of the sky . When he presently came sliding down a backstay he characteristically made no comment except , " Enoch , take over the ship 's management . " A cheer arose from the waist of the little catch ; whenever the captain turned over helm and sail like this , action was bound to follow in short order . Considerably less than the usual confusion prevailed than aboard most buccaneer vessels about to close for action . The half-naked , bearded men and skinny youths sought those posts in which Morgan had found them most useful . Demi-culverin shot , no larger than a man 's hand , was heaved up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch 's four unimpressive cannon ; a mere gesture , since an exchange of broadsides with the type of vessel he intended to attack played no part in Captain Morgan 's tactics . He placed far more reliance in the discharge of those six brass murdering pieces , or big blunderbusses , mounted on swivels let into his rail . Each of these engines was charged with a hatful of musket balls , odd bits of metal , pebbles , and even glass when it could be found ; the effect of even a single well-aimed murdering piece across an enemy 's deck was fearfully effective . Characteristic of the young Welshman 's ingenuity was the fact that he had caused such a weapon to be mounted in his main crosstrees , and so eliminated any protection an enemy might gain from tall bulwarks and superior size . Bragging , cursing or merely staring in anxious anticipation , the Free Guift 's crew made individual preparations for action . Unalarmed , quite confident in the advantages afforded by superior weight of metal and a numerous crew , the tall stranger altered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yellow banner of Castile and came steering steadily down on this wretched catch riding so low andhumble in the water ; beyond a doubt she was a native coaster working her way up the coast of Yucatan from Cartagena , Porto Bello , or Gracias a Dios . Aboard the catch her crew fingered their weapons and anxiously studied the stranger . After all these days of cruising about a great and empty ocean , it proved vastly exciting to behold another vessel . " Enoch , " Morgan inquired softly , " what do you make of her ? " " The other craft , " he informed , throwing his weight against the tiller , " is an azogue , square-rigged and , worse luck , uncommon high-sided . I figure , an we trim our sails well , we 'll have the foot of her by near two knots . " " Judson ! Break out and hoist Spanish colors , " Morgan directed . When the boatswain crossed to a flag locker and pulled out a crudely stitched red and yellow affair , Jackman spat resoundingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , poor Kate Pyne 's heart-rending screams and young Throston 's wails were still sounding terribly loud in his ears . At the end of half an hour , the two vessels , mere specks on a vast and bright blue sea , were standing along courses which must cause them to pass each other , as Morgan was planning , out of effective cannon range . Less big talk now was heard aboard the catch ; the older men were looking to the priming of their weapons and the younger staring in frightened amazement at the gilt work gleaming on the stranger 's handsomelycarved forecastle and poop . " She 's new , Harry . See ? Her ends ai n't near so high as most yell see hereabouts . " " All the same , " Judson remarked , " the Dons is still building them tall wooden castles fore and aft , which ai n't a mite of help in heavy weather . " When a trumpet blared aboard the stranger and its notes came winging arrogantly over the placid sea , Morgan ordered his colors dipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " The stranger altered course as if to hail , so Morgan ordered Jackman to put over his helm enough to veer away sufficiently to cause the azogue  --  if he wished to speak  --  to stand in open pursuit . Every veteran aboard the Free Guift already had guessed the maneuver contemplated by their captain and licked their chops in anticipation ; they could attest the success of such tactics . As quickly as the tall dispatch ship had cruised grandly by , near two hundred yards a-beam and steering broad before the wind , Morgan turned to Jackman . " Now ! " At the same moment as the catch jibed and darted off in the azogue 's wake , Judson jerked down the Spanish flag and , yelling excited oaths , hoisted the Free Guift 's private banner , a huge green flag bearing a golden wyvern for its device . An amazed outcry resounded aboard the dispatch ship , for now , not a quarter of a mile in her wake , this innocent-appearing little catch was fairly flying along , her sails drawing so hard that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pursuer almost at once could make out San Geronimode Huelva painted on a scarlet panel set amid the blaze of gilded scrollwork decorating the azogue 's stern . The Free Guift 's company could hear a volley of hurried commands being shouted aboard the San Geronimo but , because the two vessels were sailing nearly in line ahead , the buccaneers could discern nothing of such activities as were taking place aboard the azogue . Long before the enemy was able to wear , let alone bring her port batteryinto action , the handy and well-sailed buccaneer catch came closing in under her stern castle . There , the muzzles of two stern chasers came114 Cutlass Empirenosing out of their ports only to meet a deadly blast fired by Morgan 's two forward murdering pieces . At the resultant groans and screams of pain the buccaneers set up a strident howl of excitement . " Be still , you mis-begotten bastards , " Morgan bellowed through a leather speaking trumpet . " Quiet ! Get ready to board ! Steady , damn you ! Do n't crowd the bows or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sprit was rising and falling a rod short of the Spaniard 's rudder post . Almost directly overhead dark and bearded faces could be seen lining the poop . At the very last minute the Spaniard attempted to jibe , but the maneuverwas clumsily executed and served only to fetch the catch right under the azogue 's counter in such a position that none of the San Geronimo 's hastily-manned guns could be depressed enough to bear ; nor had the Spanish captain , thanks to the swiftness of Morgan 's maneuvers , been granted opportunity to rig such nettings as now were becoming popular in corsair afflicted seas . Reeling and rocking , the catch came grinding alongside just under the azogue 's main chains and secured herself to the San Geronimo by means of two grappling irons rigged to bow and stern . Already two , three , six of the more agile members of Morgan 's crew were following their captain in a mad scramble up the enemy 's high side . Cutlasses gripped between teeth , more and more buccaneers swarmed up towards those heavily gilded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch , Jackman fired both his pistols at Spaniardstrying furiously to beat back Morgan and his companions , then shouting , " Death to all Papists ! " grabbed up a half pike and headed a second handful of attackers up the lurching , swaying side . Although not a few Catholics were among the buccaneers , these yelled just as loud , since the Church of Spain frequently failed to recognize certain  --  notably French  --  Catholics as true communicants of the Churcli of Rome . Like so many apes off on a saturnalia of destruction , the buccaneers followed Morgan 's half-naked figure over the azogue 's rail and dropped with steel swinging among the wildly yelling gun crews . Jackman 's men steadied themselves against the San Geronimo 's shrouds long enough to blaze away with their pistols whenever the Spaniards attempted to rally . Screeching like fiends dipped in Holy Water , the corsairs then dropped to trade pike thrusts and cutlass slashes along the broad and sunlit deck . The fight did not last long . Amid a flurry of glittering blades , Morgan , Jackman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck , littering it with limp or writhing figures whose blood , under the rolling of the ship , soon commenced to trace bright scarlet patterns across the deck . An Admiral of the Coast 115The buccaneers , maddened by so unexpected a success , would have murdered the azogue 's crew to a man had not Morgan 's great voice begun roaring , " Grant them quarter , you bloody hyenas , else I 'll cut ye down ! Damn it ! I want prisoners ! " Valueless prisoners could always be disposed of later and nowadays Harry Morgan craved intelligence as intensely as a miser his gold . A hurried count revealed that but a single buccaneer was dead , of a bullet wound in the throat , and another lightly wounded in the leg . Singly and by twos , threes and fours the buccaneers routed out from various hiding places near twenty of the San Geronimo 's complement and drove them sobbing , praying and pleading across some fifteen bodies sprawled in the sunshine and up to Morgan , standing blood-streaked , sweat-soaked , but grinning broadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners was a middle-aged redhairedofficer looking more than ridiculous for being found half-buckled into a very handsome gold-mounted cuirass . " Piedad ! No nos matan . Soy capitano . " Rolling despairing eyes at Morgan , the Don dropped on his knees and held out empty hands . " You may be a captain , but you 're a damn poor apology for a fighting man . " He turned to Jackman . " I 'll tend to him later . Now Enoch , bring this ship into the wind . Call down to Judson to do the same . " Presently the tall vessel and her little consort commenced to wallow and pitch side by side on the bright blue and otherwise untenanted sea . " Wot about them wounded ? " grunted a greasy-faced ruffian whose empty right eye socket shone red . " Make shark bait of ' em , " Morgan directed . " They 'll die anyway , so ' t is kinder thus , eh , boys ? " Terrifying screams arose  --  and ended very quickly and completely . The surviving members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trio of prisoners been discovered below . Two Frenchmen and a giant Englishman were led dazed and blinking up the companionway and into the sunlight . " Belial smite me ! " Jackman burst out . " Can these be men ? " The liberated captives indeed seemed scarcely human so fouled were they by their own feces , so indescribably dirty , unkempt , their sunken , lack-luster eyes peering out from behind matted masses of greasy hair . Naked or wearing the last noisome tatters of breeches they stood blinking and still half stunned by the suddenness of their release from ponderous gyves and handcuffs . At the sight of great sores marking the smaller Frenchman 's whip scarred body , Morgan 's men commenced to snarl oaths which grew even more sulphurous on learning that the second Frenchman 's tongue had been split , when he attempted to speak he could produce only unintel-116 Cutlass Empireligible gobbling noises . The rage of the buccaneers , however , failed to achieve its peak until the Englishman , one Jeremy Dent , held up a grotesquely swollen left hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulp . " That 's what they did , " Dent mumbled , " but I still ai n't turned Papist . " Before Morgan had descended to the more than comfortably appointed cabin of Don Pablo de Salizar y Moreno , certain of Dent 's tormentors were pointed out by him and flung overboard to sink immediately or to swim a little while , hoarsely pleading for rescue . As Morgan had anticipated , little treasure was likely to be discovered aboard a dispatch vessel . Into his hands fell nothing more satisfactory than a large chest of silver coins destined to pay off the Viceregal garrison at Trujillo in the Presidency of Nicaragua . He felt far from aggrieved , however , despite the disappointment of the rank and file of his followers ; not only was this azogue almost brand new , sound in every timber and capable of real speed , but in her holds rode a most useful store of small arms , powder and unmounted sakers and culverins . Supper , served by a wide-eyed and apprehensive prisoner , proved a pleasant affair . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with near a dozen stout fellows who could be sold as slaves , lay chained , hungry and wholly miserable on the slimy stones of the azogue 's ballast . Aye , Morgan felt more than satisfied . First , he 'd employ Jackman 's uncanny skill at matters of seamanship in redesigning this vessel 's canvas and rigging ; then heavier and better guns , though fewer in number , would be mounted on this prize . " Well , seems we 've won us a real ship at last . " Morgan 's broad red face beamed like a setting sun across the table at Jackman . " Now we can go after larger game . " The New Englander removed from his mouth the chicken leg he had been gnawing . " You 're set to singe the Spaniard 's beard , eh ? Well , in such a vessel I can sail you into Havana  --  and , more important , out again ! " " I may call on you to carry out that boast , but first I must recruit . " Grinning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Enoch , stir that lazy butt of yours and send up Jeremy Dent  --  he must know something concerning Spanish dispositions on the Tierra Firma . " Chapter 6 . THE CHEVALIER DU RAUSSETFROM A DISTANCE TORTUGA APPEARED NOT TO HAVE changed much during the past three years , but once the tall azogue whichAn Admiral of the Coast 117had been called San Geronimo de Huelva stood in towards shore , her company could tell that many dozens of houses and more or less **26;4600;TOOLONG huts had been constructed above the busy beach of Cayona harbor . Farther inland , on that rich little river-laced plain lying between coast and foothills , quite a number of really substantial structuresdotted the shore line . It being early morning the Golden Future had for company only a. few small craft coasting out to the fishing grounds . From the lofty quarterdeckof his prize , Captain Harry Morgan was quick to note that that fort built by Elias Watts had more than trebled in size since that day the little Free Guift had fled before the murderous intention of 1'Olonnais , Darbraunceand others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How many of those captains I met that day under the Governor 's awning will be in port  --  or still alive , for that matter ? Wonder , too , if they 've heard yet of my taking the azogue and my successful descents on Gunduacan and Porto Lagartos , and finally my capture of the Viceroy of New Granada 's own trading galleon ? Surely news of my doings must have penetrated across the Gulf of Campeche ? " The azogue 's captain turned his head and considered the other componentsof his microscopic fleet . Nearest to the flagship sailed the Free Guilt , a mere cockleshell by comparison followed by the White Hart , a trig red-painted brig of near ten tons ' burthen . Three years and about seven months had elapsed since Morgan , as a brash young fire-eater , had departed to better his fortunes along the wild coast of Mexico . Somehow , it had not troubled his conscience in the least that the words " four months " in his commission miraculously  --  or thanks to the skill of a certain forger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . " So pleased with the world was Henry Morgan that , as he cocked a dark eye at the banner floating from his azogue 's signal yard , he broke into a broad grin . Heigho ! How sad it had been to part from lovely and loving Dona Serafina Maria , she whose needle had embroidered that lively golden wyvern on his great personal signal . Only sorrowfully had he sailed away leaving Serafina Maria distracted and threatening to slay herself amid the blackened ruins of Porto Lagartos . Serafina Maria had at least one consolation , however ; she would produceno reminder with which to bless or curse his memory . Lately , a disturbing fact had commenced to prey on his mind ; not one of the several females who had shared his bed ever had declared herself pregnantby him  --  with the one exception of a Creole baggage who , on Santa Lucia Island , he 'd won at draughts from Jeremy Dent . Weeping , the pretty little brown thing had claimed him as progenitor of a baby which might , or might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 118 Cutlass Empire he had not lingered to make certain on the point , but had made the Creole 's future reasonably secure . For the twentieth time , Morgan weighed the odds of receiving a hot reception for , since 1660 , the white and golden lily-dotted banner of Louis XIV , King of France , had been flying not only over Tortuga but above Ports Margot and de Paix on Hispaniola . That energetic casuist , Bernard Deschamps , Chevalier du Rausset , now ruled in old Watts ' place . Turning to his quartermaster , Morgan ordered his other two vessels signalled to close in . Why not make his return to Cayona as impressive as possible ? A brief exaltation thrilled him when all three of his vessels fired salutes , then dipped gold and green ensigns to Cayona Castle . A hard and reminiscent smile momentarily curved Morgan 's full lips when his vessel went sailing by those identical battlements he had scaled one moonless night . To the Welshman 's unspoken relief , the Bourbon dynasty 's white and gold banner dipped acknowledgment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white smoke burst from the castle 's saluting battery . Once the Golden Future had negotiated a line of reefs protecting the harbor proper , Morgan stared . Where was the pitiable raucous village he had known ? In its stead now existed a thriving , prosperous appearing little town . He found reassurance in observing that only two vessels of any conse- quence were in port . One was a frigate of about the Golden Future 's own tonnage , the other a large , but typical buccaneer barcvnjonga . Long , lateen-rigged and lying very low in the water , she was admirably suited to sudden sallies out of hidden river mouths , for , propelled by either sweeps or sails , she could in short order overhaul and pounce upon an unwary vessel . No sooner had the azogue 's anchor plunged bubbling and seething c down into the harbor 's translucent green depths than her crew corn- menced eagerly to swing out the small boats and into them dropped sacks , bales and various bundles of hard-won booty . Ashore , merchants hurried to mark up their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broached fresh kegs of that rich and fiery rum which in ever increasing quantities was beginning to come over from Jamaica . " Send me Henri Cot and I 'll try to determine what 's what ashore . " For all that Cot , an absconding banker from Lyons , had managed to drum a fair knowledge of French into Morgan 's bullet head , the latter was n't yet sure concerning certain idioms and nuances . Presently the interpreter appeared , a most noticeable apparition in saffron satin pantaloons , sash of salmon-pink silk and a claret-red jacket . Amid raucous and cheerful obscenities shouted by the crews of his miniature squadron , Morgan was preparing to slide down a rope into his gig when Judson , the azogue 's deck officer , yelled , " ' Old ' ard , ' Arry . A barge 's puttin ' out from the Castle 's water battery and ' pears like it 's showin " e bloody Governor 's flag . " Dark features contracting in anxiety , Morgan swung back onto the deck , ordered his men to stations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a gaudily decorated blue , white and silver barge . She surely made a pretty sight with her shiny black oarsmen swinging in perfect unison and the blue-painted blades of her oars swiftly propelling her towards the Golden Future . The table in the dining salon of the Governor 's very comfortable mansion , built above and beyond that modest little edifice which had housed Elias Watts and his family , was set for six . A truly impressive array of silver and gold eating utensils marched at right angles to a rank of variously-shaped , wineglasses . Walls of dark yellow plaster had been draped and enlivened by a number of garishly colored Spanish shawls . The dining chamber much more suggested the dining salon of some rural French aristocrat than that of a governor set over one of the most lawlessand licentious ports the world had yet beheld . " My apologies , mon ami , " the Chevalier du Rausset was commenting to Morgan .
