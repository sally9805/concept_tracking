A tall , dark 30-year-old Southern girl , Nancy Sasser has in short order won a success that many a professional might not attain in a lifetime . Out of her amateur spirit something new under the sun has been born . <P> Year ago she was writing a bright little shopping column for the Raleigh ( N.C. ) Times and Norfolk ( Va . ) Ledger-Dispatch . Not knowing in her ignorance that such columns usually make their modest living by contracting to advertise the wares of local manufacturers and local shops , she tried plugging nationally advertised products . Retailers loved it , paid her well . <P> Last February , still amateurishly hopeful , she set out for bigger game , headed for the biggest newspaper she could think of , the column-leary New York Times . To launch her expansive venture she mortgaged a piece of inherited real estate . This week her syndicated shopping column , Buy-Lines , appears in 32 top U.S. newspapers with total circulation of 9,000,000 . Among her clients : the New York Times , Detroit Free Press , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Orleans Times-Picayune , Memphis Commercial Appeal , Seattle Times . <P> Sponsored like radio programs , Nancy Sasser 's Buy-Lines is sold to individual newspapers on a 13-week contract , does not plug rival products in the same column , or accept omnibus advertisements for a company manufacturing several articles . <P> Sample ad : <P> " Here 's your chance to pack a little of the romantic wallop from ' Down Argentine Way ' into your own personality ! Remember those dashing Gauchos free-riding o'er the Argentine pampas ? DOBBS has copied their broad-brimmed hats . . . . "
