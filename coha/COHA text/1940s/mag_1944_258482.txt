Independence day dawned cool and cloudy in Atlanta . Soon after the polls were open for Georgia 's Democratic primary , two well-dressed Negroes drove up to a small drug store on the south side . The Negroes went in , politely asked the white woman in charge of registration lists for their ballots . When the registrar was unable to find their names on any list , the Negroes left as quietly as they had come . <P> <P> An Atlanta cop , placidly picking his teeth in front of the drug store , remarked : " We do n't have no trouble with niggers out here . " <P> A. T. Walden , Negro Atlanta attorney and State head of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , appeared at Precinct B. His own precinct , where he votes regularly in general elections , was in a Negro neighborhood . It was closed for the Democratic primaries . When Lawyer Walden gave his name and address , he was told , " That 's in Precinct 3-B . I 'm sorry , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He argued . O. L. Walker , election official , said firmly : " This primary is for white voters only . " Both sides were careful , softspoken , scrupulously polite . <P> In spite of the U.S. Supreme Court 's ruling in the Texas case that Negroes must be allowed to vote in Southern primaries ( TIME , April 17 ) , Negroes did not vote last week in Georgia . In spite of the fact that some 5,000 Negroes had registered and paid poll taxes in Fulton County ( Atlanta ) . Negro leaders saw to it that only enough Negroes should appear ( and be turned down ) at the polls to make a test case in the courts . <P> The U.S. press , applauding the lack of violence , tentatively hoped that the South might be growing more tolerant . " White supremacy " was still a burning issue , but there were some indications that the South may be slowly reconciling itself to the idea of ballots for Negroes-provided they do not clutter up white voting places . <P> A Sunday columnist for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which may have made many a white Southerner uncomfortable : " We can not much longer continue to subject Negroes to ' taxation without representation ' or draft them to jeopardize their lives in defense of a democracy which denies them the right of franchise .
