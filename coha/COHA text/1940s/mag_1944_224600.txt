The B-24 Liberator , Sweating it Out , was doing just that . Over the European target it had taken such a beating from flak that its bombs jammed and would not drop . Now it was limping home , crossing the Channel , with all four engines damaged and the hydraulic system shot to bits . <P> With the landing crack-up almost certain , Bombardier Lieut . Edward M. Gibbens , of Mountain Home , Idaho , took a crash ax , doffed his parachute , perched on the narrow catwalk of the bomb bay and started knocking the bombs loose . As the last one dropped away , Gibbens skidded on the leaking hydraulic fluid and fell . With a frantic , one-handed clutch he caught hold of a bomb rack , slowly and painfully pulled himself back to safety as other crewmen came up to help him . <P> Then Gibbens stared at his other hand . It was still holding the ax .
