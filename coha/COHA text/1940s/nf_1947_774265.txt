txt  | migrant Negroes was far more resented by the old Negro population than by any element in the white population , which rarely came into very close contact with it . Nearly three generations of adjustment , which in those old abolitionist towns had very nearly solved the " Negro problem , " were upset and to a large degree nullified . The old Negro population in my own town at first made some sincere efforts toward providing recreation and education for the newcomers but grew discouraged and fell back into an attitude of apathy and resentment , and my town , like many another similar community suddenly found on its hands a " Negro problem " which had until the migration been nonexistent . The fault was not fundamentally that of the Negro imported from the Deep South . It was the fault of the elements in our society which brought him suddenly out of one environment into another without the slightest degree of preparation . Many of the overnight Southern Negro migrants were scarcely above the level of an African savage , some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a background of native tradition and primitive civilization . Overnight they were plunged into the midst of what to the average Deep South Negro must have seemed another world . At least it was another civilization ? for such a gap separates the social and economic background of the average prosperous Ohio town from the backwoods communities of Louisiana , Mississippi and parts of other deep Southern States so that there seems to be little connection between the two . The cure for all of these racial differences and ills is at base equal economic opportunity , education ( in the case of the Southern Negro , and for the " poor white , " better diet and better soil upon which that diet is grown ) , better ethics and finally the annihilation of ideas about the superiority of one race over another . Some day all races will commonly intermarry and when that day comes many of the problems plaguing us today will have disappeared . As a rule , the lower the economic and social status , the more intense the prejudice . You can not cure Bilbo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ignorance and prejudices of the constituencies which they represent all too well . All this is a long way from the problem of the wild dogs left behind by the constantly moving " poor whites " in our Ohio county yet it is all a part of the same thing . The wretched , abandoned dogs take to the wooded hills and ravines and band together in packs to live off the poultry and ducks and sheep  | of the countryside , eventually to be shot by the dog warden or some irate farmer . The Boxers look on the farm as their property and God help any dog that comes on their land . They have killed two of the wild dogs , and a week ago Harry saw the comic spectacle of two foxhounds in headlong pursuit of a fox across the valley fields with the six Boxers hot on the trail of the foxhounds . Ruefully Harry told me two days later that he had seen in the county paper a reward of $25.00 apiece for the two foxhounds which had run away from their owner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reward . When last seen they were going over the crest of the Bailey hill . The fox had long since escaped and the hounds were running hell-bent to escape the Boxers . DECEMBER 31 : The last day of a year which can go without regrets so far as the world is concerned . I have had much to be thankful for in my personal life and the life of Malabar , most of all the great progress that has been made during the last year toward the goals which were set up in the beginning and I have been very lucky indeed in friendships far and wide . There are times when I am very grateful for having spent so many years outside America , in Europe and the East , not only because it helped me to understand the stupendous things going on in the world but because it has made America a new country to me , which I will never again take for granted as so many Americans do . Out of the countless letters I get from overseas , I gather that the experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and appreciate this country as they could not have done without having seen something of the rest of the world . It seems to me that this country is inexhaustible in its variety and beauty and in the variety of its people . The Sinclair Lewis philosophy , like most of the thinking of the twenties , was superficial , especially in its assumption that Americans are standardized . A Texan and a Bostonian could scarcely be further apart and still belong to the same race and nationality . Perhaps , most of all I am thankful for having been born in a country which , after an absence of twenty-five years spent all around the world , I found I would have chosen to be born in , if I had had the choice . Its woods , hills , streams , fields , and springs suit me . They have the fertile , half-wild , well-watered beauty which seems to me to include almost . everything . I suppose everyone in the world feels that way about the ! country in which he was born , but the feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it to the test against other countries and landscapes over most of the world . Today it is raining instead of snowing , but the snow is so deep that the thawing rain has made little impression upon it . Very little rain is running off . It is being soaked up by the snow and carried on down into the earth . Sometimes the snow goes quickly and the streams turn to torrents , the water rushing off the land to create floods downstream . This time all the deep snow and the rainfall is being soaked up by the soil beneath , a good thing after the long , hot dry summer . The underground reservoir will need filling up after two dry years . Thus far the weather has been wonderful for the wheat and the meadow seedings . The ground beneath its deep cover of snow is scarcely frozen at all and is protected from the devastating heaving process caused by alternate freezing and thawing . The deep snow has brought numbers of birds close in around the house and the suet and grain box outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of them . I am very ignorant about wild birds , but in the next year or two I must repair the deficiency . It would add greatly to the pleasure of watching birds and understanding their actions . Heavy snows like this one often drive in rare birds , which in my ignorance , I do not recognize . I do know the mourning doves which strangely do not migrate but stay with us all winter , and the jays and a variety of flickers and woodpeckers , and of course many of the migrating beauties like the Indigo bunting , the Baltimore oriole , the kingfishers , the goldfinch , and the shy and dazzling scarlet tanager which one sees only in the deepest part of the woods and the Jungle . And in winter the cardinal is very common when he comes in close to the house to feed . Our native Ohio birds can be surpassed in color and beauty only by the birds of India . One of the sights of the world is the assortment of brilliant-plumaged birds to be seen in Crawford Market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , very close in about the house , for they seem to prefer people and bustle and sociability to solitude . They are noisy and thieving and at times when they build their big , shaggy , disreputable nests among the grapevines or in a roof gutter or behind the statue of Ganesh over the front door , I would like to be rid of them . Jane Francke , who is a great bird expert , says they drive away other more rare and timid birds but I do not find this so . She advocated shooting or poisoning them but that I can not bring myself to do . It is true they drive shyer birds away from the feeding table but once they have had their fill they go away and the other birds take their turn .  | They never want for food because they are brassy and fearless and feed out of the corn cribs or on the barn floor and even inside the cattlefeeding sheds .

One little hen sparrow slept every night for three winters on a ledge inside the portico covering the front door .

I am only afraid that Pete or one of the other big barn cats got her . NEW YEAR 'S DAY ? January 1 : The rain of yesterday has turned to thick snow which fell softly without wind and all the trees are white this morning . The roads are bad for when the temperature dropped below freezing , ice covered them . Now there is about four inches of fresh snow on top of the ice . Charley went off this morning to fetch Jennie Oaks to make the butter and has not come back . If he does n't show up soon we shall have to send the tractor for him and his car . Last night in bed I read Gertrude Stein 's article about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful piece of vivid writing , as American as corn-meal mush . ' When Gertrude writes " straight " no one writing today is so able to transfer to a reader emotions and sensations of sound , smell , and touch . We knew Bilignin , the little town in the Ain where she and Alice B. Toklas spent the whole of the war , and have stayed in the house she writes about . All this gave the story a peculiar vividness . You could see the beautiful countryside and the towns all the way up to Chambery.l Gertrude 's greatest quality as a writer and as a companion is her immense capacity for enjoyment of the moment . Each small experience is always new and exciting and filled with inner meaning . I do not know how old she is but she has been on this earth for a considerable time , yet there is no one I know who is younger . I have never met anyone whose mind is so stimulating . I think this is so because it is not really a cultivated mind but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds of most of us , a derivative mind , formed by tradition , by culture , by the reading of books and daily papers and magazines . The thoughts which come from it are purely original , like the thoughts of a brilliant child . That is what makes her such stimulating company . footnote 1 Gertrude Stein died in 1947 at the American hospital in Neuilly . She and her friend Alice B. Toklas were among the closest friends of the Bromfield family ,  | At the time of Munich , I remember Gertrude and Alice B. Toklas both said , " We worked very hard in the last war , bought an ambulance and hauled things and soldiers about . There is no excuse for this war which is coming . It was made by the stupidity and fear of men and we intend to take no notice of it . " That may be what Gertrude and Alice intended to do , by going off to their house in a remote part of France and staying there throughout the war , but they did not do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in the midst of everything , making daily visits to neighboring towns , joining in the intense feeling of contempt for the Germans . And Gertrude had luck too for Bilignin is in the very area where the Maquis movement developed . She loves young men and the Maquis caught her imagination and affection . The radio broadcast and the articles were the first direct news we had had of Gertrude and Alice since March 1942 . Then in a letter written just before Thanksgiving in 1941 she said , " Alice has finished putting up preserves . We have a turkey for Thanksgiving . The food situation is not too bad here . " Evidently they were still trying to take no notice of the war . From the articles , it is clear they did not succeed . I have not heard what became of their wonderful collection of plctures ? Picassos , Braques , Picabias , etc. , mostly given to Gertrude in the early days when she and her Brother Leo fought the battle for modern painting . All the pictures were in their flat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but beautiful house built in the seventeenth century by Queen Christina of Sweden . The Germans took a great many private collections , like that of the Robert de Rothschilds , but all the painters represented in Gertrude 's collection belonged to the school which Schicklgruber designated as " degenerate art , " so they may have been left intact , unless some shrewd and cynical German fell upon them and recognized their value .2 Alain and Elie de Rothschild are still prisoners in Germany . God help them ! Elie was married by proxy to a girl in Provence . Yesterday I had the first news from the Herberts since I had a wild letter from Denise in Bordeaux at the time of the collapse of France , asking for help in getting a visa to America for herself and her mother . I did all I could but heard no more from them until yesterday . Monsieur Herbert died just on the eve of the war .

She wrote that Mademoiselle Julie Mancheron , the last of the three old-maid sisters who were our proprietaires , was dead . She must have been at least 95 years old . She remembered well the Franco-Prussian war and lived in a great , beautiful house in the Rue des Cordeliers , known as the Hotel Flamande , built in the sixteenth century by a rich Flemish cloth merchant who had come to Senlis to learn the linen industry . She was the one who said , when I offered to pay the three old-maids three times what the place in Senlis was worth , " Monsieur , we could take your money but what would we do with it ? " She had the wisdom that came of wars , of invasion , of a dozen inflations and deflations .

All this news together with the letter from the Archbishop of Senlis and the little pamphlet telling day by day the progress of the liberation has brought back floods of memories of that beautiful and happy life in the Oise and of all the French people we love so much . We shall go back one day and see them all . It will be like opening a book which we have loved very much to reveal a chapter that pleased us . But the book itself is closed , like so much in Europe that was good and beautiful . France will be the least changed of all European countries for the quality of Frenchmen rises above occupation , destruction , politics , everything . It is , in all European culture , eternal .

My grandchildren and great-grandchildren will go to France and find there the same essence of France which I knew and which my great-grandfather found there . JANUARY 20 : Back again from California . It is extraordinary how bad weather can disrupt completely all our proud modern means of transportation ? blocking cars , throwing trains off schedule , grounding planes , causing wrecks . On the day George and I left for California we spent two hours driving twelve miles from the farm to Mansfield . We tried road after road to find each one blocked either by snow or by other cars stuck and half-buried in the snow . On the high plain overlooking Mansfield ,  | the wind and blowing snow were ferocious . I came to understand how people can be frozen to death and die quickly , scarcely knowing what happens to them . We took turns ? Tom , George , Lieutenant-Commander Heathcote and myself ? in digging snow from under the wheels of the big Buick with a borrowed shovel . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch ; you could feel ears and face freezing . When the spinning wheels cut through the snow , they came down to ice and then it was necessary to put boards and branches under the wheels . At last we turned back and found an open road which led us all the way back to Lucas where we got onto Route 39 and managed to make the town . About seven years ago a kind of Thomas Hardy tragedy took place on the high plain where we were blocked . A married woman and her lover started across it in an automobile in the midst of a similar blizzard on their way to a rendezvous in the lover 's cabin . The whole story of what happened was never known , but it appeared that the car broke down and the lover , going off for aid , became lost in the blizzard . In any case his body was found days later beneath high drifts of snow in a ditch by the roadside . The following morning , farmers noticing the car half-drifted over , went to it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . The tragedy was the first and only warning her husband had that his wife had been unfaithful to him . Even after reaching Mansfield the fight with the blizzard was not over . A freight wreck at Massillon on the main line of the Pennsylvania had diverted all trains and the Heathcotes had to go to Crestline in a school bus hired by the railroad to take care of its passengers . The bus fought its way through ice and blizzard to arrive only just in time at Crestline . In the morning the Heathcotes wakened at the hour they should have been in the Pennsylvania Station in New York to find the train had gone no farther than Cleveland . They eventually arrived in New York twelve hours late . George , Mary , and I went to the Prestons ' for dinner to wait for the midnight train to Chicago and again , in the suburbs , were snowed in . Only the aid of Mayor Locke and the city snow plow rescued us and made it possible to reach the station . There we found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ice , and wrecks . Needless to say , it was odd to waken two days later among orange groves and green grass in bright sunlight in the San Bernardino Valley . I still like Ohio and even the wild Ohio climate better than California and for my money it is much healthier .  | V : GRASS , THE GREAT HEALER ( A somewhat technical chapter for farmers principally although some others may be interested ) Still , by rotation of crops you lighten your labor , only Scruple not to enrich the dried up soil with dung And scatter filthy ashes on fields that are exhausted So too are the fields rested by a rotation of crops And unploughed land in the meanwhile promises to repay you . - The Georgics of Virgil IF WE had never heard of grass farming we should have become grass farmers simply through the evidence of our own senses ? our eyes , our taste , even our sense of touch . The advantages showed up in the deepening color of the soil , in the miraculously increasing yields , in the evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tenderness of the meat , in the sleekiness and shininess of the coats on our cattle , and the brightness of their eyes , even in the changing , ever-augmenting beauty of the landscape as grass and legumes healed over the old gullies , the poor spots in already poor fields , cleared the once muddy streams , brought life to dead or dying springs , and saved the rainfall which made the very , trees more green and luxuriant in appearance . We were always aware of the virtues of grass and of legumes and , generally speaking , our own experience paralleled that of other grass farmers and of the government and agricultural college and extension service experts . This single chapter reveals nothing that is not already known ? that grass is a great healer and that an acre of good grass can  | be as profitable as the best acre of corn and far more profitable than three quarters of the acres given over to corn in the United States . This chapter is merely the record in concrete terms of what grass has done and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , all of it at a low level of production only seven years ago and much of it abandoned farm land , of a level of production so low that it could not find a tenant or even bring a couple of dollars a year rent from neighbors . In a sense , the full realization of the virtues of grass stole upon us . In the original plan we had set ourselves up on the pattern of the oldfashioned , general farm , raising something of everything , with a high degree of self-sufficiency . It included as many head of registered Guernseys , beef cattle , hogs and sheep as the place would carry without buying feed . The number was not many . It has been doubled five times in seven years and could be doubled again if it were possible at the moment to provide within economic reason more buildings to house the animals . To this steadily increasing production and carrying capacity grass has been the principal contributor . As in the story of Kemper 's Run our valley , once the virgin forest was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glaciated hills and even the remnants of the old pre-glacial plain raise , if handled properly , the finest hay and pasture forage in the world . In the old days of horse and buggy and of great beer-truck draft horses , timothy was the great crop . Once introduced in a natural grass country , it became virtually a weed and in some of our present-day operations , still is . For a long time , no fertilizer was necessary to raise bumper crops of timothy and unfortunately many a farm went on raising fields of it and exporting from the valley thousands of tons each year to the stables of the cities without ever returning anything to the land . The yields on some farms grew poorer and poorer until the fields produced more weeds than timothy and some of the farmers gave up altogether , lost their farms or became year by year tenants or fled to a miserable hand-tomouth existence in the cities . Then , with the automobile , the horse and buggy era died and with it the market for timothy hay , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should never have been introduced . The old hillsides , once covered with grass or with grass and weeds , were plowed up and put to corn and the destruction went on at even a more rapid pace than before , for erosion was added to soil depletion and very rapidly the whole character of the valley changed for the worse until at last farm after farm became abandoned .  | That is where we came in . We did not make the mistake of many a farmer taking over poor , worn-out land ? that of overstocking and having to buy feed . We bought about the number of livestock the wornout farms could carry and went to work on the base ? the only real base of all successful farm operations ? the soil . We knew what it needed . The first job was to stop the erosion . Then we added lime , which would bring us legumes and help to release the deep fertility of the rich subsoil and make available to a high degree the commercial fertilizers which we purchased to replenish the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the barnyard manure produced in too small quantity . Naturally , green stuff meant first of all legumes , then grasses and other plants of all sorts ? indeed almost anything that would bring bulk , decaying organic material , bacteria , fungi and moulds which retain moisture and aerate the soil . As the yields increased we would be able to carry more livestock and so produce more barnyard manure which , applied to the fields would bring still richer production which would in turn permit us to carry more livestock and soon , in brief , our job was to turn the economic wheel which had been running downhill on that particular land to rolling uphill . The fact , simply put , was that we had taken over several hundred acres of potentially rich land on which the soil was , after years of poor farming , literally " dead . " Our job was to make that soil a " living " soil in which the potential fertility would once more become available . During the first two or three years , the going was hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small in quantity and poor in quality . As a makeshift in order to get enough forage , we grew soybean hay . Grass silage was out of the question and so for three or four years we grew corn for silage , mixed with soybeans to get a higher protein content and a better feed for the cattle . We went to work at once on the permanent bluegrass pastures ? those parts of the farm which were too steep or too wet for steady cultivation by heavy machinery . These pastures got two tons apiece of limestone meal and 250 pounds of superphosphate , later replaced by the same amount of whole fertilizer 3-12-12 if put on in the spring ; o-12-12 when available if put on later in the year or in the autumn . These last are formulas known to any farmer . For the sake of the uninitiated they designate the parts respectively of nitrogen , phosphorus and potassium , contained in the fertilizer . Nitrogen was omitted in late season applications as much of it would be lost during winter rains and snows . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | clover ( introduced by us ) or the native white clover ( which seeds itself and grows spontaneously where lime exists in sufficient quantity ) supplied all the nitrogen necessary to stimulate a good growth of bluegrass . In the secondary fields ? that is , fields of considerable slope on which we could work heavy machinery , but which were still too steep to risk open cultivated crops like corn ? we set up a program of small grains ( wheat or oats ) followed by hay and forage-grass mixtures kept in the field for at least three years before plowing and seeding again to wheat or oats . Our flattish land ( we have no really flat land ) and the strips on the moderate slopes were put to hard work , producing corn , without the conventional short rotations , for feeding and for silage . The conventional short rotation is one year each of wheat or oats , corn and hay . Sometimes the hay period is extended to two years . It was introduced more than a generation ago by good agricultural experts who saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single-crop system of corn , corn , corn . In this plan of hard-working the soil we were aware that recompense had to be made on a considerable scale if we were not to encounter the disaster of so many farmers who " corned " their land into decay and death and if we were to maintain even the miserable production which we inherited , let alone increase the fertility of the flattish fields . In this program too , grass played a large part , grass in the form of rye , seeded immediately after the corn , stover and all , had been removed for silage . The rye served two purposes ? to cover the field during the winter months of freezing and thawing so as to prevent water run-off and erosion , and to contribute a heavy residue of green stuff and roots to replenish and increase the originally lacking organic material , and the organic material burned up and destroyed by the open cultivation of corn and similar crops . But we knew that even a heavy crop of rye plowed in was not enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn which was carried off the fields , stalk , grain and all , to the silos . So each year on this hard-worked flattish land , we spread a heavy coat of barnyard manure on top of the green rye to be plowed in . In addition to all this two tons of lime was spread in the beginning and 250 pounds of 5-12-12 fertilizer was added to the field each year . In other words , we constantly put back not only as much as we took off in the form of fibre and grain , but more . In addition to the organic material contributed by the plowed-in rye , the green growth turned in at the height of about eighteen inches ( the maximum balance of organic mate-  | rial with maximum nitrogen content ) contributed considerable quantities of nitrogen to the fields . The formula proved itself and paid off . An accurate record of one field treated thus , with a crop record of four years in corn , one in soybeans ( pastured off ) and one in oats , showed an increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a period of four years . Oats on the same field , after five years without rotation produced 75 bushels to the acre although our soils are too light to grow good oats . ? On another farm which we rent from the Muskingum Conservancy similar gains have been recorded under a similarly unconventional treatment . This farm , with outbuildings , lies too far from the barns to permit us to haul barnyard manure to it often upon any reasonable basis of cost in time and labor . It has been kept in a two-year rotation of oats and corn , but only the grain is removed . All corn stover and oats straw is plowed back together with the annual fertilizer applications . The strongest factor in the fertility and productive gains on this farm is probably the plowing in every other year of a rank growth of sweet and mammoth clover . It is seeded every other year in oats and is plowed in the following spring , just before corn planting time , at the height of eighteen inches to two feet . The clovers contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lush green growth but boundless nitrogen as well . Together with the rising production of this farm , the whole color and texture of the soil has changed . It has grown steadily darker and the texture is so loose and friable that in some years plowing and one passage over with the cultimulcher constitute the only fitting necessary to seed corn or oats . The yields of corn under this treatment rose from about 30 to a maximum of 90 baskets in five years . Of course in the case of both the flattish fields and the Conservancy farm , grass or legumes ( sweet and mammoth clover ) played the great and perhaps the determining role in the record of increasing production . Without them , commercial fertilizer even in great quantities , would have achieved little . That is a fact we have proved over and over . To put it roughly and to say what will be said again and again in this book , we have found that commercial fertilizer is valuable to us and available to our crops in direct ratio to the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the soil . Most of the land we took over was devoid of organic material and more like cement than soil . As the grass and green manure program progressed , the immense value of grass and legumes asserted itself in no uncertain terms over the whole of the 900 acres . After the first hard three years , fields which had  | been sickly began to burgeon into new life as lime and fertilizer brought rich legumes and a heavy growth of grass roots and tops . On those fields covered by grass , no rainfall and no topsoil was lost , nor was the organic material being burned out by open cultivated crops like corn . In three or four fields , where original seedings of wheat or oats failed to produce yields that were worth harvesting , when plowed again after three years of rest and relaxation in grass and legumes , production jumped , to as high as 35 bushels of wheat and 50 bushels of oats . In one field on the Bailey Place which we have operated for only four years , lime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from under five bushels per acre when we took it over to 33 bushels after two years and to over 50 after four years of grass ? wheat rotation . The record of the field kept for a period of four years ending July , 1947 , may be of interest to readers . It is this In the first year when we inherited the field already sowed to wheat , we did not even harvest the crop since it would not have been worth the time and labor expended . The field was limed in March of the first year and in the miserable wheat stand was seeded a rough mixture of legumes ? sweet and mammoth , red , alsike and ladino clovers and alfalfa . The wheat itself was mowed down and left in the field , to reseed itself . The legume seeding came out in a spotty fashion , but with more legumes than we had hoped . There was a considerable growth of weeds . During the first summer , following the March seeding we made no attempt to harvest anything and the only operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine " of manure we found in the old barns and to clip the field three times , leaving the residue of weeds , legumes , and grass where it fell . Thus we got three growths instead of merely one to turn into the soil along with the barnyard manure when we plowed for wheat in the fall . By this process we took no minerals from the field and got three growths of weeds , legumes and grass instead of one to turn back into the organically starved soil . Of this growth at least 95 per cent came out of sunlight , air , and water , and cost us nothing but the seed . In the autumn of the second year we planted the field to wheat and the following July we harvested 33 bushels per acre . Into this plantation of wheat we put a seeding in March of the same year of alfalfa , brome grass , and ladino clover . The limestone we applied at the beginning , having broken down in two years , now made its effect evident and the legume seeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | fully . In the following year we cut two crops of good alfalfa ladino hay but the seeding was not good enough to suit us and that autumn we again plowed in the residue of legume growth and put the field to wheat . The same field which in 1943 had produced less than five bushels to the acre produced 53 bushels in 1947 . These gains appeared to us miraculous , considerably better than we had obtained in fields similarly treated on the other farms . After examination and investigation we came to the conclusion that the great quantities of organic material ? weeds , grass , legumes , and barnyard manure ? which we turned back into the soil had , together with the lime , simply released a great quantity of commercial fertilizer applied by the farmer ahead of us which was not available to his crops because the soil had been what could best be described as a mixture of cement and gravel with traces of acid . This was one of the few fields which was ever taken out of circulation during the soil improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have raised a crop every year in order to pay taxes and interest while improving the soil , as indeed every farm should and sometimes must do . In the cases where we took a field out of production for a year and turned back into the soil whatever was raised upon it , the soil was in such poor condition that the harvest would scarcely have returned the cost of seed and fertilizer . Later on we discovered the great virtues of trash mulch seeding of alfalfa and ladino clover which gave us a good crop return without taking the field out of circulation even for a year . We knew from earlier experience , that lime , legumes and abundant organic material did much to make the natural residual fertility as well as the purchased chemical fertilizer available to the plants , but in this case the gains in production were so great that the only reasonable explanation seemed to be that we had released the fertilizer purchased and put on the fields by our predecessor which had lain there unutilized because the acid soil was devoid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from June onward . Our experience with the Bailey Place was indeed almost fabulous . For at least two generations it had been known as " the thinnest farm between Newville and Little Washington , " which meant virtually the poorest farm in Pleasant Valley . It was a farm of great natural beauty consisting partly of great hills and partly of rolling bottom land made up largely of glacial , gravel loam churned into great mounds by the waters of the melting second glacier . Here and there in the lower pastures there were smooth level terraces along the creek created by the  | same water action . At the big old brick house there was a magnificent spring with an ancient stone spring house containing great troughs chiseled out of solid blocks of sandstone eight feet long and two feet thick . where butter , milk and vegetables were kept cold and fresh in the icy spring water . The farm had had a tragic history , so common in all parts of the nation , of absentee landlordism and yearly fly-by-night tenancy with both landlord and tenant squeezing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our immediate predecessor had bought it in hopes of doing something with it and had at last given up hope and sold it to us at a loss . We bought the Bailey Place with misgivings . We bought it because , despite apparently poor soil and weeds and sumach , it was a beautiful farm with a view from one hill , higher even than the Ferguson Place , which on a clear day looked into four counties ? Ashland , Richland , Knox and Morrow . In Pleasant Valley I told many of the circumstances and related some of the surprising progress that we made in a brief period of ownership . Four years have passed since then and " the thinnest farm between Newville and Little Washington " produced in 1947 an average wheat production of 35 bushels to the acre despite the losses brought about by countless cloudbursts and windstorms . This production ranks high as against the state and national average production of less than zo bushels to the acre . Some fields produced as high as 52 bushels to the acre . The Bailey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finest alfalfa , brome grass , and ladino mixtures to be found anywhere in the United States , not only in quantity of yield but in high protein and mineral content . A pound of the alfalfa grown on the Bailey Place in 1946 and analyzed at the Battelle Institute , ' was found to contain 6.5 per cent mineral content , two per cent and more higher than that contained in most alfalfa . And this from " the thinnest farm between Newville and Little Washington ! " Lloyd Andrews , a good neighbor , who knew the Bailey Place all his life , found himself while searching for strayed heifers during the summer of 1946 , in corn eight to ten feet high on the same fields which footnote ' Battelle Institute is a heavily endowed and ably staffed institution devoted to all fields of metallurgical research . More and more , it has extended its activities into the field of soils and agriculture . This experiment and research is producing many scientific facts of great interest in the relationship between minerals and trace elements and their relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | four years earlier had produced less than ten bushels per acre of nubbins with half the stalks bearing no ears at all . In all the astonishing record of the Bailey Place no part was more astonishing than what happened on the Bailey hills on the north side of the highway . These were two great piles of glacial drift which for years had spoiled the view from the Big ) - louse by their barrenness . They had been " corned " out , pastured out and " sheeped " out over a period of three or four generations until they had become sterile eyesores in the green beauty of the valley . In spring and early summer , they raised a sickly yellow-green mass against the blue skies and by July they had turned red and brown from the masses of sorrel . By August they were an ugly faded brown with the burnt-out foliage of wire grass , poverty grass , and broom sedge . During the spring they provided a little sickly pasture for a few head of livestock but after June 15 any cattle pastured there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little or no foliage to be found but the existing acid soil plants provided little or no nutrition . Only on the peak of the highest hill , known as Mount Jeez , was there any green . There , against the skies was a patch of deep green bluegrass . It marked the spot where in hot weather the sheep , last product of run-down land , had gathered to profit by any breeze that stirred : During the years they pastured there , before the hills were abandoned altogether , they had gleaned what little fertility remained and carried it to the hilltop where they deposited it as manure minus the minerals they took off in the form of meat and wool . In midsummer the hill resembled a brown , sterile mountain capped by emerald-green snow . Today in the fifth year of possession , the Bailey hills loom against the sky a deep emerald-green color from top to bottom . The green is the deep healthy green of alfalfa , brome grass , and ladino clover which yields three valuable cuttings a year of the finest quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality hay , and one for some of the most nutritious pasture to be found on the surface of the earth , a forage on which cattle grow fat as if fed upon grain and from which cows come in smooth , sleek , and bright-eyed , dripping milk from their udders . The miraculous transformation cost us about $2o per acre plus labor . In the first year of transformation we took off the once barren hills a value of at least $75 per acre in silage , hay , and pasture . In the second year , as the alfalfa , brome grass , and ladino thickened up , the value rose to well over $10o an acre . In other words , the procedure paid for itself more than three times over in one year , raising production from  | a level of about 25 cents to over $75 per acre . I know of no example so startling of the value of the New Agriculture which operates upon the principle of successful industry and business ? that you invest a dollar plus knowledge and intelligence in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The process of restoration , which in essence was no more than unlocking the hidden natural fertility of these glacial hills , was simple enough . It was this Over the whole surface of the hills we spread two tons of lime per acre at a cost of $4.00 a ton . Once this was spread we began the process of killing the miserable , acid-soil vegetation ? sorrel , poverty grass , broom sedge , sumach , and blackberry bushes which covered the hills . This we did by ripping up the vegetation with a Ferguson tractor and tiller , or field cultivator , going over the whole surface twice , the second time at right angles and at a depth of four to five inches . Once the hills were ripped up , the surface was disked twice and in the roughest spots , three times . This virtually killed the old vegetation and created an even  | surface for seeding with all the old trash left on the surface . We then drilled in 300 pounds of fertilizer , three parts nitrogen , 12 parts phosphorus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds alfalfa , 5 pounds brome grass and one pound ladino clover . All of this was done in the dry weather of early spring ? the windy season of March when the hills were exposed to the sweep of winds coming down the whole of Pleasant Valley . When the heavy rains of April and May came along , the trash of dead roots , grass , and weeds left on the surface trapped every bit of rainfall . Because of the trash there was no erosion and no run-off water even on the steepest parts of the hill . To have clean-plowed the hill in the spring season would have invited and achieved a whole new crop of gullies and the loss of much valuable seed and fertilizer . The trash surface retained all moisture and the consequent germination was at the highest rate we had ever achieved . By late May , almost over night , the once sickly yellow hills had turned to a rich green color . With the germination of the seeding came also a thick germination of the weed seeds that remained on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrot and other poor-land pests . This crop of seedlings we actually turned to advantage by clipping the hills twice during the summer months . By this process we achieved not only two crops of badly needed surface organic material but laid down a fairly thick mulch over the whole surface of the hills which kept the soil moist and cool during the drought which came later the same year for six weeks during the months of August and September . By October the seeding lay thick and vigorous across the surface of the hills . Against the blue October skies , the hills which once had been the worst eyesores of the valley were blanketed with what from the Big House appeared to be a mantle of deep green velvet . They also provided a heavy crop of October pasture . In June of the next year , the miracle proved itself . Over the hills lay a crop of mixed legumes and grass hay so thick that at times it clogged the cutter bar of the power mower . The alfalfa and the ladino had made prodigious growth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the production it would provide in three or four years . Perhaps the most startling of all was the appearance , especially in the wet , seepage spots , of quantities of red-top , a fine nutritious grass , and alsike clover which we had not seeded at all . Clearly the seed had been there all the time , distributed year after year by wind or birds , but until the lime and some fertilizer had been applied , the seedlings had  | never grown to maturity or even made enough growth to make their presence noticeable . There also appeared where it could gain a foothold thick , tight , creeping growths of native small white clover which had been there all the time but was never able to get a start until it had been given some help . The same was true of considerable amounts of red and mammoth clover which we did not include in the seeding . One thing which startled us was that the field of rich grass and legumes was completely weedless , stretching rich and green as far as one could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clipping of the year before and from the fact that the ladino clover comes on so early and grows so rapidly that it chokes out all but the coarser weeds . All this was achieved easily and at comparatively low expense on the " thinnest farm between Newville and Little Washington " on the barrenest , most sterile hills of that farm or indeed in the entire valley . I can think of no investment in these times which could show such vast returns . Yet at the very time we were cutting green forage of highly nutritious content off the Bailey hills at the rate of three tons per acre , the tenant a half mile down the road on fairly level , low-lying land was cutting half a ton or less per acre of weedy timothy hay that had little nutritive value , from fields which within three or four years more will not pay taxes and interest . In fact they do not pay taxes and interest now and no really serious tenant would touch the place . That field and the farm of which it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yearly-tenant system from which the Bailey Place had suffered for so long . I know of no sharper contrast between the old agriculture and the new ? no contrast between an agriculture which wasted along in a worn-out pattern producing less each year at a constantly growing cost of production and an agriculture based upon maintenance of fertility , the realization that land is " capital , " the most stable of all capital , and that farming is a business in which the farmer invests a dollar to make five dollars . The deep green of the grass and legumes on the Bailey Place hills had other implications besides those of soil restoration and of increased income and production . The deep green against the horizon was plain for all to see but its importance ran through the whole economic structure of Malabar Farm and touched the lives of all the men , women , and children living there . These hills were a part of the grass farming program , which meant not only a healed and restored earth but dollars and cents . They meant .  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meat , milk , butter , and cheese . On Malabar there are four big silos to fill each year and at the beginning of the adventure it was necessary to grow corn and soybean hay to fill them . With poor yields per acre this was expensive feed in terms of labor , taxes , and interest , and the corn was each year contributing to erosion and the breaking down of the soil . Slowly as the rich grass and legumes came to flourish on our hills and slopes , we began to fill the silos with grass and legumes , and as we did so we discovered many things of great economic importance to us . Briefly they were : ( i ) That our costs on grass silage were approximately one-eighth the costs of corn silage in terms of seed and fertilizer and one-fifth in terms of labor . This was so because a field well-seeded to a mixture of alfalfa , brome grass , and ladino could be left for a period of many years without all the labor and seed and fertilizer costs involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the first lush June cutting into silage year after year . The immediate labor involved was slight . By July i , all the silos were filled and sealed . There was no plowing , fitting , cultivating , and harvesting of corn with the burden of making silage in the early autumn when there was so much other work to be done . Year after year the only labor involved in the grass program was simply the harvesting of one cutting as silage and one as hay with the third rich cutting left to be pastured off . Rapidly the need disappeared for any supplementary summer pasture such as Sudan grass or the mixture of drilled corn and soybeans which we had once used and which in turn involved plowing , fitting , seeding , etc . Whenever in August or September , as in the case of drought , our regular pastures showed signs of running short we have only to open a gate and turn the herd into a new lush field of alfalfa , brome grass , and ladino . The job of making grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no drudgery . The chopper mows the grass , drops it into a wagon whence it is blown into the silo . As we own no silage cutter Bob evolved an ingenious scheme for using the pick-up baler and the whole operation became simplicity itself . The process began with mowing the green hay and windrowing it in the same operation . In some cases the mixed hay was so heavy that the windrower attached to the mower would not handle it properly and a side-delivery rake , attached to the power mower , did the windrowing . From half an hour to an hour later , when the lush grass was wilted sufficiently , the pick-up bailer passed along the windrow , picked it up , chopped it into neat bundles and pushed it across  | the platform onto the wagon attached . Of course , no bales were tied and any ten-year-old boy could build the load . At the silo the grass mass was simply pushed off into the silage cutter , no wrestling with twisted ropes of green hay . The operation as a rule keeps three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silo . As to fertilizer , the expense of the grass fields amounted to four tons of lime per acre every twelve years and three hundred pounds of fertilizer broadcast by a home-built " spinner " every three or four years ? an operation requiring only an hour or less for a ten-acre field . ( We calculated that this amount represented about the quantity of minerals carried off the field and the farm in the form of meat , milk , cheese etc . ) Poor or thin spots in any field or occasionally whole fields were treated with barnyard manure which returned both organic material and minerals to the soil . We have one field of alfalfa and brome grass which is still producing excellent yields of hay , silage , and pasture after eight years without plowing , fitting , or seeding . It is probable that with good treatment it will continue to yield good crops for at least another two to four years . ( 2 ) Two of the most expensive items of the livestock farmer 's budget were eliminated : ( a ) Protein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b ) Nitrogen fertilizer . Nitrogen and protein are essentially the same thing and where legume and high-protein grasses are used as forage both exist in abundance , the protein in the forage and the nitrogen in the fields where it is fixed by the legumes out of the air and pumped into the soil in great quantities at no cost to us beyond the lime which makes it possible to grow the legumes . In the grass program we raise less and less corn each year , and it is possible that within another year or two we shall grow none at all and buy what corn we need . This is so because acre for acre , deducting costs of labor and fertilizer and the savings in feed supplements and nitrogen fertilizer , we can make more profit on an acre of good grass and legumes than 90 per cent of the corn and hog farmers make on corn . And with a reasonable use of lime and fertilizer we are constantly building our soils instead of tearing them down by row-crop cultivation and constant plowing . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in oats and wheat both of which serve as cover crops and protect the soil . The fine elaborate root system of these grain grasses also contributes great quantities of organic material to the soil and the straw used as bedding is worked through the cattle barns , enriched by animal manure  | and urine and returned to the fields . A good many farmers and some agronomists overlook the great contribution of organic material made to the soil by the root systems of most grasses and legumes , perhaps because they are invisible . In some cases green crops plowed in as green manure contribute more organic material from the roots than from the green growth which is visible . Certainly this is true in the case of rye grass . In Manitoba , fairly dry country , agronomists have traced out the fine root system of a single wheat plant and found that it virtually filled with its hair-like roots a cubic yard of earth . One plant of tufted mountain grass in Colorado was found to have 350 miles of fine hair-like roots . This is not true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have comparatively coarse and limited root systems although corn , properly speaking , is a grass . Thc wheat and oats , grown for various purposes and for the past five years at high prices , have been extremely valuable cash crops raised while seeding new meadows . Seedings of alfalfa , brome grass , ladino mixture are made in the grain plantations which themselves serve as cover crops . The oats is used as feed for young stock and milkers and the wheat is sold as a valuable cash crop directly out of the fields to the grain elevator . Neither crop is so depleting as corn and neither crop leaves the soil bare to the drying erosive effect of wind , sun , and rain except for the very short period from seeding to germination . Both through their elaborate root systems contribute great quantities of organic material . The grass silage produces a high-protein feed ; when well made it has a protein content as high as 19 to 20 per cent . Sun-dried hay , well made of the same grass legume mixture , also contains a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding is not one of more expensive oil meal and concentrate supplements but rather that of increasing the carbohydrate content of the diet to secure a better , more productive feed balance . Largely speaking , animals utilize both proteins and carbohydrates to the highest degree of benefit , if the two are in proper balance , provided the necessary minerals are present in the forage . On a high protein grass and legume program , our problem at Malabar has become one of carbohydrate rather than protein supplement . Since the grass silage is made in June during uncertain weather there is no loss of nutrients through bad weather , for rain does not spoil silage as it may spoil hay . Most of our hay is made in the open field , sun-dried , during the more dependable weather of late July and in an ordinary year we have very little damage from weather .  | Moreover , the combination provides a rich nutritional balance , the silage providing carotene and protein in quantity and the hay picking up certain vitamins of great importance through the sun-drying process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods used in the dairy barn . No feeding hours are maintained but the hay-racks and silage bins are kept filled around the clock . Since the cows are run loose in loafing pens and are not kept in stanchions , they are able to eat whenever they are hungry , and abundant green grass silage is maintained , a situation which is as near as possible to that of open , abundant pasture . Under this system when the dairy cows are brought in during the late autumn off green pasture there is no perceptible drop in production . The loafing-shed system has in my opinion many advantages over the stanchion system . The risk of mastitis , udder , bone and joint injuries is greatly reduced . The cows , physically speaking , are certainly happier . The system also permits each cow to balance her own diet with regard to roughage , i.e. , the amounts she consumes of both hay and silage . Two cows may each be giving 5o pounds of milk . One may consume twice as much dry hay as silage and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into stanchions and " told what to eat " by being given equal amounts of hay and silage both will fall off in production . The milking cows are of course fed a mixture of ground oats and corn and obtain some carbohydrates from the ground corncob meal put in the silo at the rate of ioo pounds per ton of green silage . The corn meal also helps to keep the silage green and sweet although it is not absolutely necessary to make high quality silage . Minerals including some twenty trace elements are fed at the cow 's choice from boxes placed beside the usual salt box . One of the chief reasons for my liking the loafing-shed method of dairying is the quality of the manure produced in the loafing sheds . Being primarily the soil man on Malabar , I am especially interested in this aspect of dairying . In the loafing shed the manure is removed every six weeks or two months . Meanwhile two to three feet of fresh straw is spread in the loafing sheds once a day with a layer of sawdust put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day by day the manure is trampled . No rain reaches it and all the liquids are preserved . During this process the count of benevolent bacteria in the manure increases by trillions and the straw and sawdust , by the time they are removed , are two-thirds of the way to becoming the finest of all fertilizers , both ininerally and organically , plus the content of glandular animal secretions , hormones , and enzymes , which have undeniably an effect upon  | soil fertility and seed germination and exert a catalyzing effect in releasing and making available indigenous fertility . Under the stanchion system little of such action takes place . Too often virtually all urine is wasted and the manure pile , even when covered , consists of a heap of dry raw straw interspersed with animal droppings . If the stanchion manure is removed to a covered shed with little or no moisture in it , the curing process ( actually a kind of intensive composting involving the breaking down of carbon , cellulose , etc. ) takes place slowly or does not take place at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open the manure will lose valuable soil nutrients in great quantity through leaching . Most stanchion barn manure goes into the fields as a mixture of raw straw and droppings with most of the valuable liquids and the invaluable bacteria , fungi , and moulds , either missing or existing in small quantities . Raw straw , until it is broken down , is of very little value to the soil . For a certain period it may even be damaging in that through the operations of the nitrogen-carbon ratio , it actually robs the soil of nitrogen in the process of breaking down carbon and cellulose into decaying organic material . This breaking-down process is virtually accomplished in the loafing-shed type of operation before the manure goes to the field , and the manure feeds the soil rich supplies of nitrogen rather than robbing it of the same element . I have seen many stanchion barns operated by city farmers or as show places with elaborate constructions to accomplish what is achieved easily and naturally in a loafing shed . These include tanks for catching urine and elaborate composting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt produce a quality of manure somewhat approaching that of the loafing shed but the capital investment and operational costs are beyond the sound economic operations of the practical dairy farmer . Either he can not afford them or the price of milk to the consumer must be raised enormously to cover these considerable items of expense . Some states have laws forcing milk producers , on the dubious ground of sanitation , to keep cows in stanchions . In our own experience the cows in a well-managed loafing shed are not only healthier and more productive , but also cleaner . They are never milked in the stable itself but taken to a milking parlor at some distance which is always kept in excellent sanitary condition . The chances of dirt and infection are much less . The whole population of Malabar drinks the whole milk without pasteurization , straight from the milking parlor , thus losing none of the vitamins which can be destroyed by pasteurizing processes . Save in the  | case of careless or inefficient employees , the milk from a well-managed loafing shed ? milking parlor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that demanded by the law , and in most cases probably lower than that of most stanchion barns . In a well-managed loafing shed the cows will have a record of cleanliness as high as or higher than that of cows in open pastures . At the time of writing we have just come through a period of six months without a trace of mastitis in a milking herd of thirty-five cows . Even in the case of a heifer which injured her udder jumping over a watering trough infection failed to develop . The laws demanding stanchion dairies smell of lobbies and private influence in legislation . There is also the question of a cow 's comfort , always of importance to any livestock man who likes his animals , as well as production . I have seen some expensive , plushed-up stanchion barns which might well invite investigation by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals . I have often heard misgivings from corn-silage farmers regarding the difficulties of making good grass silage and of the possibilities of wholesale spoilage , but in our long , varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have had with corn silage ( at the top and sometimes near the doors ) . We have put up from time to time some odd mixtures such as vetch and rye ( cut when the rye was in bloom ) , wheat and sweet clover ( cut when the wheat was in the milk ) , and even sunflowers put in with corn , but none of these have proved difficult . We have made grass silage under all kinds of conditions , determined largely by weather , and always achieved good results . We have made it both with and without molasses or corncob meal , without or with water added and never suffered disastrous spoilage . To be sure , the greener it is when it comes out of the silo , the better the silage . Molasses will help greenness and so will the corncob meal for both act as preservatives , but the chief element is moisture content . If the grass going into the silo is too dry , the silage will heat and turn brown . It is still good feed but will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it has too high a moisture content the effect will be more disastrous for an anaerobic action will take place which produces the kind of rotten silage found at the bottom of the silo at the end of the season . Our own test for moisture content is a simple and effective one . The grass and legumes are taken out of the windrow and put into the silo when they are at that point when a handful crushed together in the fist will remain a limp and wilted ball .  | VI : GRASS , THE GREAT HEALER ( CONTINUED ) The general custom has been , first to raise a crop of Indian corn ... which , according to the mode of cultivation , is a good preparation for wheat ; then a crop of wheat ; after which the ground is respited . . . and so on , alternately , without any dressing , till the land is exhausted ; when it is turned out , without being sown with grass seeds , or any other method taken to restore it ; and another piece is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised than can be supported by lowland meadows , swamps etc . . . . Our lands were originally very good ; but use , and abuse , have made them quite otherwise . ? George Washington in 1768 MUCH of the foregoing may seem a digression from the subject I ' of the healing , restorative , and maintenance properties of grass farming . Actually even to the notes on the conversion of the straw of wheat and oats ( both grasses ) into high quality barnyard manure fertilizer are a part of the whole grass picture . Fundamentally of course , while the grass program costs us one-fifth to one-eighth in labor and fertilizer as against corn , we are not only preserving the organic content of our soil and checking all erosion by grass farming , but are actually building up the fertility of the soil . Of course open cultivated crops like corn and cotton are constantly achieving the opposite results ? those of creating erosion and of tearing down and burning up the organic content without which even commercial fertilizer at length becomes virtually unavailable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic material in soil  | is the fundamental means of erosion check . It keeps the soil open and loose and as absorbent as blotting paper to rainfall , drinking up the water instead of turning it off a cement-like surface . In flat , drained land the depletion of organic material through persistent and unrelieved production of open-row crops , notably corn , arrives at what might be called the exactly opposite result . With the steady depletion of organic material in flat , drained land , the soil becomes more and more like cement and instead of turning off the water as in the case of erodible hill lands it refuses to give up the water and serves actually to cement the surface above the tiling that has been put in to drain it off . In my own state , the drainage problem has become acute in the western and northwestern parts , as the native organic material has become depleted and no measures have been taken to replenish it . On some farms tiling which a generation or two ago functioned well in lines laid down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil and today increased tiling , newly placed in lines only a rod ( 16/ feet ) apart , will no longer drain off adequately the surface water after a rainfall . During the heavy rains that afflicted Ohio throughout the spring and early summer of 1947 some whole farms in the western part of the state appeared for weeks more like lakes than fertile , productive fields . More than a million acres of what once was the richest flat land in Ohio were never plowed at all during the 1947 season owing to the failure of drainage , and an acreage of almost equal size was drowned out after planting . Certainly 40 per cent of the corn planted in the same area did not ripen because of planting delayed by faulty drainage resulting from the depletion of organic material through persistent and unrelieved corn farming . Indeed over great areas of the United States , proper soil drainage has become as acute a problem as soil erosion and the Soil Conservation Service has recognized this fact by giving the problem increasing attention . In every case the waning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depletion of organic material , and to the formation of invisible hardpan conditions caused largely by the same depletion . In the flat lands with drainage problems , the grass farming program offers as great advantages and profits as in the hill country at Malabar , for grass and legumes instead of depleting organic material , maintain it and each time they are plowed in , serve to increase the organic content . The soil is kept open to air , to sunlight and to water which contribute 95 per cent and more of the growth of any plant , and the excess water is permitted to drain off to lower levels .  | Recently we have had many visitors from the flat areas of western Ohio and Indiana . They have come primarily to learn what they can of profit from our grass farming program . All of them have come to understand , most of them by harsh experience , that year after year of corn , or even years of corn in conventional four-year rotation can be disastrous if more organic material than that provided by a four-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , not only dairy farmers but beef feeders , has dawned the suspicion that they would make more money from an acre of grass than from an acre of corn while at the same time maintaining and increasing organic content of their land and preserving and increasing the efficiency of their soil drainage . Their interest has given rise to a suspicion that grass farming is highly profitable not only to dairy farmers but to beef feeders as well . For my own taste , the best beef in the world comes from the lush pastures of Normandy and England where little or no grain feeding is practiced . The same is true of much of the beef coming from the Argentine , fattened wholly or almost wholly upon lush and minerally nutritious pasture . The minerally rich semi-arid ranges of the best and Southwest will produce frame and size and vigor in beef cattle but save for a few limited areas of rich , high mountain pasture , will riot produce fat and finished beef . Nor will the average miserable , depleted weedy bluegrass pastures of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have every evidence that livestock , from steers to lambs , will grow fat upon rich pasture properly cared for and treated as a crop and a valuable one . We and one of our neighbors working on the same lush grass program have sent lambs fed only on grass , without grain , to the Cleveland market and have had them bring top choice price , with the fact announced over the radio . There are very few such pastures in existence today in the Middle West which is the great corn finishing cattle area . Beef feeding and to a great extent the feeding of hogs and other livestock is largely a process of stuffing corn , with or without sufficient protein supplements , into the animals . It is an expensive process , not only in its immediate effect of using costly feed and involving much labor but because corn , when not managed with great skill , is an exceedingly expensive crop in that rich area in terms of erosion , depletion , drainage and the general destruction of soil structure . Indeed , King Corn has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as King Cotton has been the curse of the Deep South .  | For many reasons it is impossible to overestimate the value of the legumes and most grasses as maintainers or restorers of worn out soils and as builders of poor virgin soils . Very largely they are crops which need little or no organic material in order to flourish . A gravel bank or a soil like cement , with lime and a moderate amount of fertilizer applied , providing the subsoil is reasonably good , will produce good and increasingly productive crops of legumes and grasses and in the process , provide vast quantities of nitrogen , green manure and roots to build up the organic material without which no productive agriculture can long survive . As topsoil builders their value is immense , since the building of topsoil is no more than the incorporation of masses of organic material into the raw subsoil . That is why the restoration of a deep topsoil upon any reasonably good subsoil is a much more rapid process than we have been taught in the past . Many neighbors and countless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years . The record of rapid rebuilding of topsoil from a base of good subsoil is there for all to see .  | I know of no more striking example than the Long Field on the Anson Place . It is a field in which the subsoil is largely gravel loam with some outcrops of reddish clay heavily impregnated with iron . During the first year at Malabar , I plowed this field and found that the old topsoil had a maximum depth of three inches . Large areas of the field , perhaps as much as 6o per cent , had no topsoil whatever . The condition had come about through two causes : ( 1 ) erosion , ( 2 ) the old-fashioned farmer 's fetish against plowing deeply and bringing up the subsoil to convert into topsoil by the incorporation of organic material . The field had been limed , so the former owner told us , but it was clear almost at once that there was something wrong somewhere . Closer investigation revealed the fact that the field had , indeed , been limed but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acre , an amount so ludicrously small and so quickly used up by calcium-hungry plants and animals that it had little or no effect whatever . Some years later in the autumn of 1946 , I plowed up the same field for wheat , going slowly and forcing the plow as deeply as possible in order to turn up the minerally rich gravel loam subsoil , and although the plow reached an average depth of nine inches and sometimes as much as ten , it was very nearly impossible to find any traces of the subsoil . In other words a depth of at least 9 inches of topsoil had been restored in the short period of six and one-half years . Grass , legumes and barnyard manure had turned a trick for which nature , working slowly and unaided , would have needed thousands of years . The history of the field is largely that of the topsoil building methods practiced on the whole acreage of Malabar ? simply that of incorporating as much organic material as possible , as rapidly as possible , into the existing subsoil or completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensified . The record for the first four years was one of corn silage but each year when the corn was removed , the fields were seeded to rye as a cover crop and for late fall and early spring pasture . Each year during the winter months it was given a good coat of barnyard manure . It should be pointed out that , ravaged as we originally found the field , it was in far better condition than most of the land we took over . During these four years the cattle , pasturing on the rye , spring and fall , contributed large amounts of liquid and solid manure . In the fifth year , when our grass silage program first began to operate in a small way and the same quantities of silage corn were no longer necessary , the  | field was sown to oats and produced a good yield . In the oats we sowed mixture of rye grass and Korean lespedeza which came along well d provided a great amount of good late summer pasture . By Novemr the lespedeza was gone but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick as the heaviest bluegrass but infinitely more valuable ? to the point of view of organic material because the rye grass puts t a prodigious system of fine roots in loose soils , especially during hot weather . During the winter the field was again given a coat of rnyard manure and in the following spring it was sowed to a summer shire mixture of Sudan grass , millet , buckwheat , drilled corn , and y soybeans . Nearly all of these , being legumes or grasses , made siderable contributions both of nitrogen and of organic material the form of roots and the residue of plants and weeds left after e cattle were turned off , which was plowed in . Added to all of this , of ? use , were the droppings of the cattle during the period of pasturing ? ether with the hormones , enzymes , bacteria , etc. , about which we ow so little but which have much to do with the creation of good 1 and possibly of topsoil . Earthworms , whose population increased pidly in ratio to the rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made their contribution by the processes long , described by Darwin . It was during the plowing up of the field - wheat that I made the discovery of the remarkably deepened topsoil . This was our last planting of emergency summer pasture , for by the cnth year our grass program of alfalfa , brome grass , and ladino , was ublished so widely over the farm that there was always rich , abundant hire available during the late summer and autumn months . ' I lic history of that field was largely the history in varying degrees of rest of the farm save that in the case of the Long Field repeated and trnsive applications of barnyard manure had made weighty contribu ? ns . Basically , however , grass and legumes had done the job . The Id gave about 50 bushels of wheat per acre and is now seeded to ulla , brome grass , and ladino and will remain in hay-silage-meadowhire production for at least four to five years with another two tons limestone and 300 pounds per acre of 0-20-20 plus the droppings of animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , of course , that all soils will not respond so quickly and orably as our own to the topsoil creating process . Our soils are gnlarly well adapted to the process of restoration for two reasons : ( I ) ostly they are gravelly , glacial-drift soils , very loose and workable an &; tly susceptible to the incorporation and mixing of green and barn-  | yard manure . ( 2 ) The native mineral content of the subsoil is both high and well-balanced even to trace elements . About io to 15 per cent of our land is a rich but heavy clay and with it the process of building topsoil is more difficult because the clay , more compact and gluey , is more difficult to mix with raw organic material and is likely to form lumps and pockets . Two tricks we have found effective in hastening the process of topsoil building in such clay land are : ( 1 ) Rough plowing in of organic material in the late autumn on fields where winter is not a serious erosion menace . During the winter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gluey clay is broken down into fine particles which , like the loose gravel , loam soils , mixes easily with the organic material ? roots , plants , manure , straw and trash ? which is undergoing , through freezing and thawing , the same breaking-down process . ( z ) The process of literally stuffing the stubborn soil with organic material . On some fields of clay structure in poor condition and almost wholly devoid of organic material , we have planted wheat two and even three years in succession . On these fields we have made spring seedings of hubam , a sweet clover which makes a prodigious growth in one season , flowers and dies . At harvest time the combine merely clipped the heads of the wheat leaving the straw standing , and as the summer progressed the fields produced heavy crops of sweet clover which , growing up in the straw , provided a really immense mass of material to be plowed into the clay soil in September for reseeding to wheat and the following year to hubam , again producing the huge bulk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clay within a short period . The process , together with lime and chemical fertilizer , produces rapidly increasing yields of wheat to pay taxes and interest and show a profit while the soil is being brought back to life and fertility . The wheat roots contribute much organic material and the rapidly growing deep roots of the hubam serve to break up the tough soil , and later to admit air and water while disintegrating at the same time into the soil structure itself . There is also a great contribution of nitrogen made by the leguminous hubam which is so great after the second year that nitrogen can not be used as a fertilizer and actually must be omitted . The cost of the hubam seed runs about two dollars per acre ? the best fertilizer , soil-restoring buy it is possible to make . Within the last year we have put into use disk plows which do an even better job of mixing earth and organic material than that accomplished by moldboard plows adjusted to doing a rough job followed  | by disking . This is especially true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor land is made in preparation for fitting and seeding in the spring . Owing to the rough fashion in which the disk plow turns over the soil there is no danger of erosion during the winter months . Snow , rainfall , freezing and thawing contribute enormously during the winter months to breaking down organic material involved , whether green or barnyard manures , and permits virtually the maximum degree of tilth and moisture for oats or grass-legume seedings in the spring . Curiously , the process appears to create better drainage in poorly drained spots on our clay gravel , perhaps because the loose rough soil permits the frost to penetrate more deeply into the subsoil and act in breaking up any hardpan which may have existed . Beyond the winter plowing treatment for our small percentage of heavy clay land , we found very definitely that at least two other practices contributed toward restoration of this land and rapid increases in production . These were : ( 1 ) the use of a subsoiler , ( 2 ) the substitution of disk plow for moldboard plow on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our clay land was clearly that of drainage . In fields which contained both clay and gravel loam soils , clay portions were frequently unworkable and unproductive because of wetness until days and sometimes weeks later than the surrounding gravel loam . In some cases the clay strip or patches never really drained and produced nothing but weeds and coarse wet-land grasses . This occurred even in fields on the tops and slopes of hills . The incorporation of heavy amounts of organic material helped superficially to make these clay areas tillable and productive but in the long run or in very heavy rainfall even this produced very little effect . Close observation gave us the final clue to the trouble . On such strips and patches during a heavy rain the top nine or ten inches of soil into which we had pumped much organic material , drank up eagerly enough the first two or three hours of rain and then became completely saturated . After that , the water simply stood there , if the land was flat , or ran off , if it sloped . This clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer of earth , like a layer of asphalt , which blocked any drainage downward into the subsoil . Investigation proved that this was true . A hundred years or more of plowing these clay areas had gradually produced a hardpan just below the plowing level which prevented all drainage or absorption of rainfall . Undoubtedly this land had been plowed and fitted again and again  | by our predecessors at Malabar when the well-drained gravel loam portions of the field were in prime condition but the clay portions were still much too wet . This fact , coupled with the vicious pressing down action of the moldboard plow which stays in the ground only through the violent pressure of the plow point on the earth beneath , had created over the years the brick-like , impenetrable hardpan which turned the clay areas into undrained and undrainable bogs and cut off all production of valuable crops . The use of the subsoiler ? a big , curved steel hook or chisel , pulled by the tractor through these areas at a depth of from two to three feet ? very nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on parallel lines from five to six feet apart the subsoiler broke up this hardpan and permitted the water to penetrate into the lower and more porous clay below and permitted the heavy rainfall to escape in a natural fashion . It also permitted plant roots to penetrate freely to deeper levels in search both of moisture and of nutrients . It was , of course , impossible to grow alfalfa or sweet clover on any of these areas until after the invisible hardpan was broken up . Once these vigorous deep-root legumes , which demand well-drained soil , were established , they in turn helped to maintain good drainage conditions by thrusting their deep vigorous roots down to a depth of five to six feet . The ripping up process followed by the deep-root growth of heavy legumes will undoubtedly keep this clay area open , friable and highly productive for many years to come , provided we do not put the moldboard plow back into these fields which are all on partly heavy - clay soils . In such fields we will from now on use only disk plows which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heaviest clay soils . The moldboard plow , plus the steady decline in organic material in the soils of all our flat land and heavy soil areas , has undoubtedly created the serious drainage problems which have increased steadily in many areas of heavy clay or gumbo soils to the point where even the most elaborate tileage systems have become futile and many thousands of acres of once rich , productive land have fallen out of production into the status of desert land . Each year thousands of acres in the rich flat lands of our own western and northwestern Ohio fall out of production because they can no longer be drained . I have seen , in southern Illinois and in Missouri whole fields which after a heavy rain resembled shallow lakes more than good agricultural land . The water simply remained there , held by the hidden , impenetrable hardpan until it was evaporated  | by wind and sun . One need not describe the effect upon the crops in such a field or the long range effect upon the prosperity of the individual farmer and the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless fields . In most cases the use of a subsoiler , an increase of organic material and the use of a disk plow rather than the moldboard plow would restore the land to high production within a period of two to three years . Our experience with heavy clay soils and gravel loam soils existing side by side in the same fields has demonstrated once again that in a nation as vast as this one , with so many soils and climates , there is no general rule or any set of methods in agriculture which suits all soils and all conditions . Even on so small an area as Malabar we have found from hard experience , reinforced by a little-intelligence , that there is no rule or set of rules which is efficient or effective under all conditions ; and that applies to the use of moldboard plows , disk plows , disk and field cultivators or any other farm machinery . It applies likewise to rotations of which with us there is no fixed one ; each field and area has its own rotation according to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to dairy and feeding barns and even the way it lies toward the sun . We have found conclusively that there are no over-all infallible  | rules governing agricultural practices . We use every method from trash mulching to the deepest kind of moldboard plowing according to conditions , purpose , and need . We even adjust the plows themselves to different sorts of plowing under different conditions and different topography . All this is a part of proper land use and fits into our own philosophy that the good farmer is a man who knows as much as possible , never stops ' learning , and has the intelligence to apply his knowledge and information to the conditions and the program of his own piece of land . It is the kind of farmer we must have in the nation and in this world ; it is the kind of farmer we will have inevitably because the other kind is certain to be liquidated economically , despite bribes , subsidies and price floors and their land will be taken over eventually by those who cherish it and can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even in this country , where there was once so much good land that we believed it inexhaustible both in fertility and in area , mankind , if he is to survive , can not permit agricultural land to be owned and managed by the lazy , the indifferent and the ignorant . As Dr. Hugh Bennett suggested recently in a memorable address at Princeton University , the time may not be so far away when in order to practice agriculture , a farmer will be required to have a certificate exactly as a lawyer or a doctor or an engineer must have today , in order to own or to cultivate the earth . Such a condition has already virtually arrived in England where food is so scarce that the poor and unproductive farmer can not be tolerated if the people of the nation are to eat and survive . Such a measure will not be the result of any political ideology but of grim necessity . In all but the trash mulch seedings made on the barren hills of the Bailey and Ferguson Places , where the sowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have yielded back the original seed , the process at Malabar is to plow as deep and as roughly as possible . While this may appear to be a denial of the virtues of trash mulch farming and of Mr. Faulkner 's ideas in Plowman 's Folly , it is actually an extension of the whole theory since the process of deep and rough plowing merely carries the trash farming idea to a depth of nine to ten inches instead of merely scratching up the surface and leaving the trash on top . Actually the deep , rough plowing creates a kind of sheet composting since the plowing is usually followed , particularly in the case of corn ground , by  | heavy disking which incorporates all roots , tops , manures and trash into the soil instead of turning it over and burying it to be compressed by the weight of fitting implements into a thin layer of tightly compacted organic material , of little or no use and even perhaps a disadvantage to the immediately succeeding crop . The process leaves soil and trash well mixed together to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moisture and in the process of disintegration produces stimulation to the bacteria , moulds , fungi , and worms which are so vital a part of any living , productive soil in which the mineral fertility is available to the plants . Actually the process converts and maintains our topsoil as a kind of perpetual compost heap in which we grow our crops . During the disastrous flood rains of 1947 when cloudburst succeeded cloudburst for weeks , this sheet composting system demonstrated its great efficiency as a check upon erosion . On contoured slopes where there are sometimes on our land sudden dips and slopes , the soil , mixed together with great quantities of decaying organic material , kept the earth loose , open and absorbent of most of the water and run-off . Even in violent rains erosion was virtually checked . A handful of such soil appeared to be nearly 50 per cent in bulk of composition made up of rough , decaying organic material . We plow as deeply as possible when plowing because of the high mineral content and the loose quality of all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malabar before we discovered that perhaps our worst problem was the restoration of the mineral and organic content of the flattish areas where a so-called " topsoil " had escaped erosion . So badly had the existing topsoil been depleted by greedy farming that where a woodchuck dug a hole , the minerally rich subsoil which he brought up from ten to twelve feet below the surface actually acted as fertilizer on the depleted topsoil and actually grew better more vigorous crops than the surrounding topsail . The sight of a clump of extremely vigorous , deep green oats , corn , soybeans , or wheat in the midst of an otherwise mediocre or even sickly field invariably indicated a spot where the woodchucks had been at work . With this tip-off given us by the fat little burrowers , we set the plows as deeply as possible to bring up the subsoil and incorporate with it as rapidly as possible all the organic material possible . Later on , continued experience led us to the heretical belief that we should have made more rapid progress in restoration if we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm the miserably depleted topsoil  | that remained and had gone directly to work on building new topsoil out of our minerally rich and well-balanced subsoil . It is largely a fact that in a period of eight years we have produced good productive soil directly from bare subsoil more rapidly than from the pitifully worn-out topsoil which we inherited . Since the many amounts of organic material introduced into both soils were approximately the same , the experience is a striking example of the mineral depletion and deficiencies of many of our old , still existing topsoils . The experience would certainly not be true in the case of all subsoils . At Malabar , we happened to be singularly fortunate in our subsoils as are all farmers in glacial moraine areas . Some subsoils are structurally and minerally so poor that once the topsoil is gone it is impossible to restore fertility by any method which is economically practical . Such land is fit only to be given back to pine forests or at best to be used as thin grazing land . All this is another evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country with such an overwhelming range in types of soil , climate and rainfall as the United States . Under the grass farming program now well-established at Malabar , it must be evident that most soils plowed for crops are heavy sods compounded of alfalfa , brome grass , and ladino clover . These when plowed up after several years produce prodigious amounts of organic material as well as a seed bed fairly well impregnated with nitrogen to a depth of six to seven inches by the shallow-rooted ladino and to a depth of many feet by the alfalfa . In cases where the plowed sod-soil is to be seeded for wheat , it is necessary to kill the alfalfa plants to prevent their rank growth the following year and consequent difficulties for the combine . In order to bury thoroughly and kill alfalfa without turning it over and burying it to the destruction of our sheet composting operations it was necessary to develop a special plowing technique which would leave the fresh plowed strips of sod in a rough vertical position and still cover the alfalfa . This was accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jointers . This was found to be possible and effective , so that our rough-plowing sheetcompost methods could be retained while the alfalfa was buried and the whole field covered by two or three inches of clean earth as a seed bed for wheat . As a result many of our fields going from alfalfa sod into wheat have the appearance of an old-fashioned , clean-plowed field when actually beneath the surface they are as rough plowed as possible . The disk ploughs which cut the alfalfa roots have proved more  | effective than the moldboards in killing unwanted alfalfa . In the cases of two strips of wheat side by side on the same soil with the same seed and the same amounts of fertilizer , one strip rough-plowed and disked , produced as much as ten to twelve more bushels of wheat per acre than the strip which was " clean plowed " and fitted in the oldfashioned way . Needless to say , the rough-plowed strip had a much higher moisture content and was virtually immune to erosion either by wind or by water . The absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corn ground since the corn is not combined and alfalfa plants surviving here and there are no great disadvantage and possibly through nitrogen production , of some benefit . Experiments have been made at the University of Illinois of growing corn with a rapidly growing grass and legume clover as a substitute for cultivation . While the experiments are not final , yields of 115 and 12o bushels have been obtained in successive years recently . This is , of course , far above the average yields in Illinois of below 45 bushels per acre for several years past . Such a method of growing corn would of course greatly reduce the damage caused by erosion and destruction of organic material arising from the existing methods of open cultivation . We have long cherished the idea of experimenting with corn in a sod of alfalfa and ladino clover . The plan is to cut strips through a heavy alfalfa , ladino sod with some implement like a rototiller which would " chew up " the strips of sod to a width of about six inches and then seed the corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced by a mower which twice or three times during the growth of the corn would clip the alfalfa and ladino between the rows and leave it there for mulch . Such a process is an extremely reasonable one since it would eliminate all erosion and virtually all destruction of organic material . Also it would virtually eliminate weeds since the ladino grows so rapidly and persistently that it would choke out all annual weeds before they got a start . The process would also feed nitrogen heavily to the corn on the upper levels from the ladino and on the deeper levels from the alfalfa roots . The mulch of clippings would also conserve great quantities of moisture , together with ample nitrogen , so important to corn . We have not made the experiment because no suitable machinery exists and because we have not had time until recently from other arduous duties of soil restoration . While it is scarcely possible to overestimate the soil restoring properties of the real grasses , the legumes remain the backbone of  | the process or of any grass farming program based upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so because the legumes can grow , unlike many of the grasses , on land which is wholly devoid of the organic material that is vital to the growth of almost all other kinds of vegetation save the trees and the most worthless of weeds . Legumes will grow abundantly in bare subsoils of good or average quality and with good drainage where lime is present in sufficient quantities . At Malabar our best alfalfa and sweet clover grows upon bare gravel banks or in heavy clays , both minerally rich , but devoid of all topsoil or organic material . Once the deep-rooted legumes start growing , the incorporation of organic material and much nitrogen in the form of green manure becomes an easy matter and the creation of excellent topsoil is inevitable . This is a direct contradiction to what farmers have generally been taught for a generation or more ? that alfalfa is a plant which must be pampered , sown on carefully prepared ground , limed well in advance . We have found beyond dispute that alfalfa is not an aristocrat but a pioneer . So long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxuriant crops of alfalfa , sweet clover , and ladino and alsike clover on the poorest land covered thinly only one year earlier with poverty grass , wire grass , goldenrod and broom sedge , and as I have pointed out earlier , the growth was stronger and healthier than that of alfalfa sown upon our little remaining worn-out topsoil . The experiments of Dr. A. L. Borst of the Soil Conservation Service at Zanesville , Ohio , with alfalfa as a poor-land crop also proved this point beyond argument . Out of aoo seedings made at the Zanesville station and on neighboring farms on subsoil of shale quality much poorer than our Malabar glacial subsoil only two failures were encountered . Dr. Borst has ' published the result of the experiment in a pamphlet issued by the Department of Agriculture . Our own experiments in the same field took place over virtually the same period as those of Dr. Borst and have been described at considerable length in Pleasant VaIIey . Both alfalfa and ladino have proved invaluable at Malabar not only as soil restorers but also as producers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process . In our experience the only places where alfalfa , accompanied by lime , will not flourish is in poorly drained areas . While alfalfa roots will penetrate to prodigious depths in search of moisture it can not survive " wet feet . " In our experience even poor hill land is better for the production of long-standing , long-maintained alfalfa meadows than our lower , richer , moister land . Darwin in The Voyage of the Beagle describes his aston-  | ishment at finding in Chile on desert land great patches of succulent , deep green forage . He was told that it was a plant called alfalifa . The deep-rooted legumes like sweet clover and alfalfa thrust sturdy roots to great depths , as great as the measured depth of 46 feet in Colorado . Fourteen- and fifteen-foot roots of alfalfa are commonplace at Malabar where the rainfall is much more abundant . At the Zanesville station Dr. Borst dug pits exposing nine- and ten-foot root systems penetrating even into the stiff gray shale underlying gravel loam deposits . These root systems tend to break up stiff soils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant is plowed under or killed , the sturdy roots , decaying , leave in the soil not only great quantities of nitrogen and highly available fertilizer in the form of phosphorous , potash , calcium and many of the trace elements , but leave small tunnels which admit both air and water deep into the soil . Moreover , legumes , both deep- and shallow-rooted , when sown in mixture with grasses , perpetually feed those grasses with a nitrogen supply drawn from the air at no cost to the farmer and serve to stimulate a rank growth of grass tops and roots so valuable both for forage and for building organic material and topsoil . The healing properties of grass and legumes on poor or abused earth are like those of the white corpuscles of the blood in healing over wounds and burns on the human body . The value of grasses and legumes to the well-being and prosperity of the farmer and consequently to the nation as a whole in restoring the vast acreages of worn-out or poorly drained or eroded soils in all parts of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor and fertilizer costs , increased purchasing power for the products of industry , lowered taxes and better food and diet for every citizen , whether the farmer or the city dweller who eats what the farmer grows . On the day of writing this chapter I made a trip with three neighbors through three of our northeastern Ohio counties all based upon the Wooster silt loam which is minerally one of the finest soils in the world . We saw not one farm in ten producing a half of what it was capable . One in ten was falling into decay as the fields slipped nearer and nearer to the deadly line where they could no longer pay taxes and interest and became abandoned , a waste and a drain upon our economy . One out of ten had already fallen into this category . Any or all of them could be brought back to a state of high fertility at a comparatively low investment of capital and a considerable investment of knowledge , experience , and brains . If I were a rich man , I could think  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rehabilitation of these run-down or abandoned farms . Within a period of ten years , I would be certain of a 300 per cent gross increase of capital investment , a gain not based upon inflated prices but on the solid basis of Federal Land Bank appraisals ? that of production per acre . It seems to me that too few people with reserves of capital and savings have seen the possibility of investment in basically sound but wornout land in a world which is starving and in which there will never be in our time even a fourth of the food needed to feed it even on a modest diet . The population of the world is steadily increasing and the area of productive agricultural land and of production per acre has been constantly shrinking . The prices of food with increased efficiency of distribution are not likely to decline , short of a universal economic disaster and even then it should be remembered that people must eat even before they can satisfy the devastating urge to propagate new members of the human race which in turn must eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or vicious inflation good agricultural land always remains the soundest of all investment . But beyond all that is the immense and fundamental creative joy and satisfaction which comes of making two grains grow where one has grown before , of seeing a whole landscape change from drabness and desert sterility to green and wonderful abundance . It is a joy which many a Jew , returning to his homeland in ravaged Palestine , has experienced in our time . There is perhaps no human satisfaction so profound . And there is the great contribution which the investor in such a project can make to the welfare and sound economy of the nation . In most of our country grass , the great healer , and the legumes which flourish side by side with it , can turn the ebb tide of sterility into a rising surge of abundance and wealth and vigor . No sight is more tragic than a worn-out abandoned farm and none more beautiful than the prosperous home and barn surrounded by rich fields . And no sights present so vivid a symbolism in relation to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malabar have led all of us toward some new and , to many soil authorities , possibly some startling and revolutionary conclusions regarding the fertility of soils . Two noticeable conclusions have been forced upon our attention ; even though we might have been ten times less observant and interested than we are , we could not have  | avoided them for the evidence has been thrust upon us again and again . ( I ) That mineral balance plus nitrogen and indeed all the laws of balance in soil , which may be very nearly as absolute as those governing astronomy or physics or mathematics , have great bearing upon the health of plants , animals , and people and that in the case of plants a great bearing upon their resistance not only to disease but to the attacks of insects as well . ( 2 ) That any good subsoil and notably our own good well-balanced minerally rich silt loam , possesses a fertility which , if managed properly , may be eternally available and very possibly inexhaustible . The problem is to make that hidden , locked-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantities . The case of balance in soils and the great and largely unexplored values of trace elements to plants , animals , and people has been explored with considerable thoroughness in the chapters " Gardening without Tears " and " of the Earth We Are Born and to the Earth We Return , " so there is little need to go into it here any further than to observe that the subsoil at Malabar is not especially gratifying material to work with experimentally since it already possesses in its well-balanced glacial subsoil , from the evidence of the vegetation itself , a good supply of trace elements with the qualified exception of iodine . Our experiments have been most rewarding on the depleted topsoil which remained here and there on the farms at Malabar . The problem was actually to raise the mineral level and balance of the depleted topsoil to that of the virgin silt loam gravel-filled subsoil . In the vegetable and flower gardens we have been notably successful in raising the resistance of plants both to insects and disease and the campaign is being carried out elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results . The second conclusion regarding the inexhaustiblity of fertility in reasonably good subsoils can be explored a little further . In this book the reader will come across many times the phrase " universal law of fertility ? the cycle of birth , growth , death , decay , and rebirth . " It has been used again and again because it has played so large a part in the rehabilitation of the non-productive land at Malabar and because slowly , but again and again , the cycle has asserted its vital and unmistakable importance . In combination with the theory of balance of dements , that cycle has done the job of turning wholly unproductive , eroded fields into fields which produced more yields per acre than 90 per cent of the agricultural land in the United States . It was not for the purpose of this book alone , that I have asserted  | again and again the mere fact of barrenness . Every neighbor knows the fields and every neighbor has watched the process across the fences that border the county and township roads . For two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " thinnest farm between Newville and Little Washington . " Four years of work upon it proved that its sorry reputation lacked truth and that fundamentally the whole of the Bailey Place was actually rich land , richer by far than most of the agricultural land in the United States . On it occurred a number of experiences which at first we could only regard in the light of miracles . The wiping out of gullies and of the loss of water and topsoil was quickly accomplished simply by engineering but the tremendous and rapid gains in fertility and yields seemed nothing short of miraculous . There was the miracle of the Bailey hills , brown and red with sorrel and broom sedge and poverty grass , transformed within a year into thick , succulent emerald-green alfalfa , brome grass and ladino . There was the corn which changed in four years from sickly three-foot stalks bearing nubbins or nothing at all to a high level of production , and the miracle of the field that jumped in wheat production from 5 to 33 to 52 bushels yield per acre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which jumped from less than a ton per acre of weedy , wooden timothy to four and four and a half tons per acre of succulent legumes and brome grass . And on the Fleming Place , fields which once would not yield 15 bushels of oats per ace produced in the summer of 1947 over 8o bushels , although the soil is too light to be good oats ground . And the high field on the Ferguson Place ; once a barren eroded field which in 1947 produced 6o bushels and better wheat per acre on that part of the field where the subsoil was gravel loam . And the bluegrass pastures on the Ferguson , Fleming and Bailey Places , not so long ago thin , burnedout , half starved , weedy pastures filled with iron weed and wild carrot which today are carrying on lush bluegrass and white clover twenty times and more the number of cattle they carried only five or six years ago . When we began searching for the reasons for all of these things , often with the aid of scientists far more informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , even in that of the pastures , back to the same and simple conclusion ? that these gains had been made by restoring to the eroded , worn-out fields devoid of organic material and of mineral balance , that eternally fundamental cycle of birth , growth , death , decay and rebirth . By doing so we had made highly  | available the chemical fertilizer we put on the soil , unlocked the thin residue of fertilizer left by our predecessor which until then had been largely unavailable and in the case of the Bailey hills and the high Ferguson Place we had undoubtedly unlocked great stores of native fertility which until the cycle was re-established had long remained wholly locked and unavailable to all plant life . In other words , those farms were not really poor and worn-out farms at all . Except for the Anson Place , they had merely been farmed badly so that their native fertility , for various reasons , was no longer available to the crops . There is nothing mysterious or magical about the process . It is available even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possession of the Department of Agriculture and of the state colleges . The only mystery concerning it is why it has not been more widely used to restore millions and millions of acres of potentially good land which through ignorance and abuse has been going down hill since the first furrow was turned on virgin soil . The theory of the inexhaustible fertility of basically good , sound , well-balanced subsoils may seem new , although Faulkner in his latest book A Second Look has dealt with it in some comments which are immensely stimulating . Sir Albert Howard , greatest of British soil men , with a knowledge of soils from the broad English counties to Indore and Ceylon , has moved steadily toward the conclusion which led him to believe that good soils should , to a large degree , take care of themselves and remain eternally fertile if properly handled . Dr. Bray of University of Illinois , certainly one of the finest living agronomists , has had intimations of the truth of the theory growing out of his experience . Certainly he believes strongly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be supported or explored by the overspecialized or by those academic minds which believe that all that can possibly be discovered about agriculture has already been discovered , for it is a theory which in a sense , involves knowledge and curiosity in too many fields ? biochemistry and bacteriology , chemistry , botany , biology , plant pathology and the scarcely touched mysteries of the place which moulds and fungi , animal hormones and secretions and many other things play in the universal cycle of health , fertility and production , not only in soils and plants but in animals and humans as well . It involves the pattern of the whole universe including the health and vigor and resistance of plants , animals and people and of the vigor and intelligence of people . Needless to say , that is a vast and largely unexplored field and perhaps  | the truly intelligent and reasonably informed dirt farmer can make the greatest contribution of all as he has done so often in the past in the solution of agricultural problems . For he lives nearer to all these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intricate interplay of all the elements involved . Therein lies the profound truth uttered by Confucius centuries ago and quoted in Pleasant Valley that " the best fertilizer on any farm is the footsteps of the farmer . " Observation and intelligence in a farmer can sometimes outweigh in value countless tons of chemical fertilizer . At Malabar it seems to us that the operation of these theories is a fairly simple one . The belief has come partly from observation , partly from experiment , partly by pragmatic methods . Like all farmers , we believe , above all else , what works . It is for the research people equipped with time and education and laboratories to find out why it works . But we have our own ideas , simple perhaps but deeply logical . As has been stated before , we have at Malabar two broad categories of soil ? about 85 per cent glacial drift gravel loam either in static deposits or that which has been worked about by the action of water , and about 15 per cent pre-glacial , heavy , but potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of tons of stones ranging from minute fragments to glacial boulders weighing many tons . In the clay there is little gravel . These facts are important since the capacity of the gravel loam soil for feeding minerals to plant life and eventually to animals and people is probably much greater than the similar capacity of the clay . Also , as has been stated earlier in this chapter , it is much more difficult to incorporate organic material into the clay than into the loam gravel soil . These points have considerable value in the record of the two soils . While the same gains in fertility are achieved eventually in both types of soil , the results are achieved much more quickly on the loose , minerally rich gravel loam ? indeed at least three times as quickly . It is evident even to the most superficial observer that the accumulation of stones and rock fragments existing both in the gravel loam and the clay soils are constantly breaking down by the action of wind , heat , frost and water . Rocks and stones are the source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are simply broken down stone and rock plus the organic material provided by the death and decay of vegetation and the mineral content of stems , leaves and tree trunks drawn from the disintegrating rocks and in the process converted into highly available organic form . In the broader sense , the rock and stone content of soil from the largest mountains to the finest pebble , are constantly feeding  | minerals to the soil both in the process of direct disintegration and by transmutation through various forms of vegetation . The important point in so far as fertility is concerned is whether these disintegrated or transmuted minerals are available to the plant life growing upon the soil . Concerning this aspect certain things are well known and long established ? that many minerals which could make a great contribution to fertility and production are simply not available to plants where there is an absence of calcium and that none at all are available in the total absence of moisture . It is also well known that organic material is a great absorber and conserver of moisture and is therefore vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Organic material is also vital to the fertility even of land which must be drained to be rid of too much water and land where unlimited supplies of water are available for irrigation . Plants vary greatly in their need and liking for moisture but none can wholly thrive , even to the lichen growing tightly against a granite boulder , unless some minute quantity of moisture and organic material is present . The lichen , once established on a rock , proceeds rapidly to provide its own organic material by the death and decay of its own leaves through which it has translated inorganic minerals into highly available organic forms . Since calcium is a vital part of soil balance and of great importance save to a very narrow range of acid-liking or tolerating plants and trees , its place becomes of great importance in the process of unlocking fertility , partly because chemically it has a greater affinity for most minerals and trace elements than have iron and aluminum and snatches away the minerals and elements vital to health and growth of plants , animals and people from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked up and unavailable . In combination with calcium all these minerals and elements exist in a form highly available to plant life and consequently to animals and to the people who feed upon the plants and upon the milk , eggs , and meat produced from it . ( Most people and animals and plants living upon a sour land devoid of calcium have definite characteristics and display the symptoms of many mineral deficiencies , most of all , deficiency of the calcium essential to good bone structure , health and vigor . ) On all definitely sour lands largely devoid of calcium the human stock shows inevitably a gradual deterioration in which in the course of time , individuals achieve definite general characteristics that set them apart from the peoples of more favored areas . The same is true of areas in which calcium and other minerals have become depleted . These facts are definitely responsible  | for the physique , characteristics and even in some degree the cultures of the so-called " poor whites , " " hill-billies " and " okies " ( all originating on poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the keys to unlocking hidden and unavailable fertility . It is also the key to producing the high-protein nitrogen-producing legumes which also bring the organic material which plays so large a role in the whole cycle of birth , growth , death , decay and rebirth out of which all fertility and life are evolved and maintained . Beyond these facts , which are established and well known , one enters a still mysterious and largely unexplored field having to do with the trace elements and their effect upon enzymes , hormones and the functioning of glands in animals and people , and the realm of bacteria and their actions and that of the fungi and the moulds from which those miraculous new anti-bodies , penicillin and streptomycin and others , have been or are being developed . That these moulds and fungi contribute to the breaking down of minerals and their transmutation into availability to plants , animals and finally people is a fact that , in our experience at Malabar , can not be overlooked since each day brings new evidence which we could not ignore if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Health has contributed perhaps more than any other authority to the establishment of the important place which moulds and fungi play in the foundation , restoration and maintenance of soil fertility . He makes the assertion that , together with the bacteria , they play an important role in the unlocking of inexhaustible fertility . Ed Faulkner with his enthusiastic , searching , speculating mind , has touched upon the power of bacteria , moulds and fungi to hasten the breaking down of all mineral material from boulders to tiny pebbles and their power to make the disintegrated minerals available to plants , animals and people . None of these ? bacteria , moulds and fungi ? can exist without considerable degrees of moisture nor can they exist or multiply save by the presence in the soil of organic material in the process of death , decay and rebirth . Therefore organic material , in whatever form , becomes of vital importance to the productivity of any soil and particularly to the availability of the native minerals and elements in that soil and to the availability of chemical fertilizer applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic material acts as host and food supply for bacteria , moulds , fungus , earthworms and other organisms which are intrinsic elements of all living and fertile soils , the organic material serves as well to check erosion and improve drainage and aeration . With calcium ,  | organic material provides the key to that cycle of birth , growth , death , decay and rebirth which makes the mineral content of the soil , whatever it may be , available to the plants and consequently to animals and to people . When any segment of the cycle ? moisture , bacteria , moulds , fungi , mineral balance , organic material or the calcium content , ( which is perhaps the most valuable element in mineral balance ) ? breaks down , the whole chain is broken and one by one the various links collapse , bringing about the rapidly declining production and eventual sterility which is characteristic of so much once good and still potentially good agricultural land in the United States and in the entire world . Of course outside the circle lie other elements which contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ availability or fertility , notably the residue of trace elements and the effect of the glandular secretions and bacteria from animals which contribute greatly to the cycle on soil where barnyard manure is used . As was pointed out in Pleasant Valley it would be possible to recreate synthetically and chemically the mineral content of a given amount of barnyard manure but the resulting mineral content would fall far short of achieving the same degree of fertility as the manure itself on a given plot of land , even if credit was allowed for the organic material contained in the manure . Somewhere there are mysterious elements which have not been sufficiently studied or understood . Nevertheless , while the content of barnyard manure is from all points of view , the best long-range fertilizer man can use , relatively excellent results in establishing the cycle of fertility and restoring or maintaining fertility can be obtained , as we know well at Malabar , by the use of green manures in which the animal clement with its glandular contributions and its trillions of living bacteria are missing . And , repeating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manures are not of the same content or value particularly on the mineral side . Poor land , deficient or depleted , or land where the mineral fertility is locked up in chemical combinations with other elements will produce poor manure , infinitely less rich in mineral content than the manure resulting from grain and forage off soil where there is an excess residue of minerals which the animals do not need or can not utilize and which consequently is returned to the soil . Since the publication of Darwin 's book on the earthworm , few intelligent people have doubted the great contributions made by this lowly organism toward converting crude subsoil into rich and fertile topsoil of highly available mineral content . But the earthworm can exist and function only if the other links called " moisture " and " organic ma-  | -1 0 terial " are present . Withdraw these and the earthworm together with bacteria , moulds and fungus all perish leaving the soil to become poor and unproductive , not because there is a shortage of mineral fertility but because this mineral fertility becomes unavailable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States a bad name ? of being " worn-out , " poor or unproductive ? when a proper system of agriculture , based upon the eternal cycle , would prove it within a short time to be prodigiously fertile . It is one of the errors of the earthworm fanatics that the planting of a few hundred earthworms in a sterile field devoid of organic material will restore the field to a high degree of fertility . Under such circumstances the planted earthworms will merely suffer from lack of moisture and eventually die from lack of organic material on which to feed . The presence of earthworms in a field where there is moisture and organic material in the process of death and decay will hasten greatly the process of unlocking and making available the natural richness of the soil but without moisture and organic material they merely die out . Again the whole cycle fails because one or two links of the chain are missing . We have found at Malabar that the mere increase of organic material and consequently of moisture has brought in armies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cycle restored to operation . We have had bare dry banks converted into dark soil to a depth of five to eight inches in a few years merely by top dressing them with barnyard , and in particular with chicken , manure . Not only does the mulch of manure encourage and promote vegetative growth but it conserves the moisture vital to existence of the earthworm and provides decaying organic material to sustain it and give it the force to multiply rapidly . The spilled grain and mash present in chicken manure provides the earthworm with a particularly rich diet as the grain ferments and turns to sugar . Any fisherman knows that the best place to find earthworms in abundance is in or near an old manure pile . Only one serious doubt remains with us regarding complete efficacy  | of the cycle of fertility and its ability to release from our own minerally rich soils a fertility available in sufficient quantities for the crops grown . We do not know whether , in the case of heavy yielding crops , the process of breaking down of minerals into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants growing in profusion . If on a given square mile all wastes , even to human bodies after death , were returned directly to the soil , it is clear that that area would lose none of its mineral and comparatively little of its organic fertility , but on any farm these conditions do not hold . There is always the mineral drain represented by the eggs , milk , meat and bone , fruit , . vegetables , etc. , sold off a farm which to great extent is carried off eventually and in turn from cities in the form of sewage into the all consuming sea or buried in a lead coffin in a graveyard . If the soil , through the cycle of birth , growth , death and decay and rebirth can break down its content rapidly enough to replenish this drain , then commercial fertilizers on land possessing good , balanced subsoils would be unnecessary and the natural mineral fertility alone would suffice : but it is possible and probable that heavy yields drain off minerals more rapidly than the cycle breaks them down into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm becomes a necessity in order to maintain fertility and yields . The opening of a gravel pit in the cemetery field revealed a whole new segment of information concerning what has been going on deep down in the " worn-out " soil of the lower fields on the Fleming and Bailey Places . We needed gravel for the upkeep of the miles of lanes and barnyards ; paying eight dollars a load to have it trucked in might have been a negligible item on some farms but it suited neither our budget nor our plan . Such precious gravel was clearly beyond the means of any but a millionaire farmer and we knew that somewhere beneath the surface of our own lower fields there must be deposits of gravel , clean enough for road building . It was Bob who did the prospecting . In his spare time , he began making borings with the posthole digger and wisely he turned to the cemetery field where , save in the lower end , there had been in the beginning no topsoil whatever . The field contained one edge of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bottom fields of the Bailey Place and Fleming farm where the revival of productivity in response to lime , legume and organic material had been sensational . He chose the cemetery field for three reasons : ( 1 ) It lay hidden away  | where the possible unsightliness of a gravel pit would be least noticed in the general landscape . ( 2 ) It lay close to one of the principal lanes where gravel would be easily available for hauling .. ( 3 ) There was every indication that the long , semicircular ridge had been produced thousands of years earlier by the action of waters rushing out from under the Second Glacier and that therefore the waters had probably done all the " washing " for us and we would be able to haul the clean gravel directly from the field to the lanes . The prospecting was a brief affair . At about the fourth or fifth boring , he hit a beautiful mixture of clean sand and gravel and the Ford-Ferguson loader went to work . It is necessary here , I think , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular ridge in which Bob made the boring . It had been originally a field from which all topsoil was eroded . By the use of lime and legumes plus a three-year period of " restoring " under pasture management it had , when seeded to wheat , produced thirty-seven bushels of wheat per acre . The seeding of alfalfa , brome grass and ladino ( made in the wheat ) immediately produced a great deal of grass silage , hay and pasture . The production along the ridge already described had been nothing short of prodigious and on the spot where Bob prospected , alfalfa left standing as a test was over three feet high . Moreover it consistently produced on that particular spot virtually the maximum quality of matured seed . These facts naturally aroused a passionate interest in discovering what miraculous process was taking place out of sight deep down in this subsoil . The excavation was begun far down the edge of the slope that marked the ridge and the work of a day or two of digging produced a cross section of the subsoil to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large part of the story was revealed . First of all , we discovered a great depth of stratified gravel and of sand so fine that it could serve as moulding sand . The layer of sand , although the season was dry , was saturated with water . The gravel was of all sizes from that of a pea to small boulders the size of a man 's head and all of it smooth and rounded by the action of water which had been taking place for thousands of years . The gravel contained stones of a hundred different compositions , nearly all of them foreign to our country in preglacial times which indicated that they had been transported to our valley from regions perhaps as far north as the Hudson Bay country by the scraping action of the glacier , on the surface of the glacier or embedded in it . The stones ranged from iron through gran-  | ite and flinty conglomerates to pieces of limestone so soft that it was possible to etch them with the fingernail . The gravel pit was indeed an amateur geologist 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trace elements , was represented . Most of all , these stones were all in various stages of disintegration , according to their composition and hardness . The conglomerates , the limestone and even the granite , were rotting away slowly . The fact was that the gravel pit represented a depository of concentrated and diversified mineral fertilizer high in availability and virtually inexhaustible as a source of plant , animal and human food . It was all there waiting to be utilized . Under the agricultural methods employed by our predecessors this mine of mineral wealth had simply become unavailable . Originally the earth above had been covered by a thick hardwood forest with deep roots which fed upon the mine of minerals , carried them upward toward the sunlight and the air to translate them into organic form as wood fiber , leaves and blossoms ; these ? as they grew , withered and died ? fell to the surface of the earth and over a period of millions of years formed a deep rich layer of mould and topsoil . Then came the first pioneer who cut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this rich layer of soil . The seed germinated and in the richness upon which it fed produced huge growths of crops other than trees ? crops which fed the animals and people . The old , slow forest system of pumping up the mineral richness of the gravel pit and depositing it upon the surface of the earth was broken . The new crops were shallow-rooted and fed scarcely to the depth of the layer of rich topsoil . From the deep level there was no more replenishment and the farmer , blessed by the great natural richness , put nothing back either of minerals or of organic material into that comparatively thin , dark-colored top layer . And presently , after a couple of generations , the yield of crops and the mineral and vitamin content of them began to decline . But another process , even more destructive , was occurring at the same time . As the organic material of the ancient leafmould soil became oxidized and depleted under constant cultivation , the rain ceased to penetrate the earth and began to run off it , carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the Mississippi and Gulf of Mexico . A little was deposited on the more or less flat ground of that particular cemetery field below the gravel-impregnated ridge , but most of it was carried away altogether and lost , probably forever . At least two disasters had occurred . The topsoil , formed by nature so  | slowly over millions of years , was carried away altogether down to the level of the raw soil and gravel . Or when the topsoil remained it was virtually depleted of all available minerals , especially of the calcium that nature had provided as the great catalyzer to make the other minerals available . Above the surface of that rich mine of mineral fertility the owner and then the tenant produced less and less until at last the fields became unwanted and deserted and the cemetery field became part of what was called a ruined and worn-out farm . And all the time deep down or even exposed at the surface of the eroded fields where it could be seen and touched lay thousands of dollars of virtually inexhaustible mineral fertilizer . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us not only the great reserve which lay there beneath our feet but it showed us many things which had been taking place since we had gone to work on the cemetery field and which in turn had brought about the return of richness and fertility to a " worn-out " field . To begin with , on the very surface of the soil which only eight years earlier had been bare gravel sparsely covered with poverty grass and sorrel , there appeared a comparatively thin layer three to four inches in depth of dark , rich , friable soil . It was made up of many things ? of the roots and leaves which had been clipped and left there by mowing or had died in the course of the season 's change to fall there and disintegrate ; it represented the roots , stems and leaves which had been turned into the soil by the plow ; it represented the droppings and the effect of the urine , hormones , and glandular secretions of the animals which had pastured over it for a period of three to four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other factors , many of them still unknown , produced by the various varieties of legumes , red and white clover , alsike , ladino and sweet clover which had been seeded there , and the action of the finely ground limestone which had been spread there to make the existence of the legumes possible ; and it represented , perhaps in minute quantities , soil blown from devastated prairies and grazing land , blown from hundreds of miles to the west by the prevailing winds . All this thin layer represented new topsoil created not by millions of years of action but by eight years of concentrated attention to natural methods . Just beneath this thin layer could be seen the building process actually at work . Below the dark layer which extended downward in a fringed fashion , there lay a whole world of rootlets ? the fine roots of  | the ladino , penetrating to a depth of seven or eight inches each covered with the tiny nodules of the nitrogen creating bacteria . Then below this the deeper mass of hairlike roots extending downward to a depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the brome grass . These tiny rootlets , being fed with nitrogen by both ladino and alfalfa , penetrated deep into the richness of the disintegrating glacial gravel . In this area the formation of deep topsoil was in what might be termed the secondary stage . The individual stones of all sizes were crumbling rapidly and had begun to take on the appearance of topsoil in its earliest stages of development . Here as in the top shallow layer lay revealed the intricate tunneling of the earthworms which in the process of passing the plant materials and tiny fragments of stone through their bodies were darkening the mineral mass as they turned it into available plant food . But most spectacular of all was the story told by the roots of the alfalfa . These extended downward to a depth of from twelve to fourteen feet into the slowly crumbling mass of sand and gravel . At the top , near the thin layer of topsoil they were coarse and thick as a thumb , spreading out at the surface in a crown of rankly growing stems and leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slender , sending out all along the way small lateral roots covered with nitrogen producing nodules which extended horizontally on each side of the stem into the mineral riches of the gravel . Finally at a depth of twelve to fourteen feet the rootlets fanned out again in a network of hairlike rootlets penetrating in all directions . What we saw exposed was the whole system by which the alfalfa was tapping the deep mineral richness ( as the roots of the primeval forest had once done ) and bringing that richness upward to the sunlight and the air on the surface of the ground where it was deposited in highly available organic form . In other words the deeprooted alfalfa and the deep-rooted sweet clover which preceded it had restored the ancient process by which these reserves of mineral fertility were tapped . But there were other evidences as well of the remarkable capacity of the alfalfa to convert the slowly disintegrating gravel into available fertility . In a kind of column surrounding each of the heavy alfalfa roots to a depth of two feet into the gravel and sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surrounding gravel or descended from above along the course taken downward by the root . How this came about or what the process was by which this topsoil was forming about each root , I do not pretend to know . I only know that the result was  | there for all to see and that it explained a little the remarkable ability of deep-rooted legumes to create soil and make mineral fertility available . One other happening had a special interest and in it a herd of yearling Guernsey heifers played a part . They were pasturing in the field when we opened the gravel pit and with the frisky , wide-eyed curiosity of young heifers they joined us to watch and would not go away . Presently one of them discovered the alfalfa roots that became dislodged and spread about as we worked . She picked up a root and began chewing on the coarse upper end near the crown . Then another and another followed her example until all of them were chewing on the alfalfa roots like children on lollipops . The roots were tough and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to tuck away for further use . They persisted and kept on getting in the way of the loader and truck in their eagerness to pick up the dislodged roots . This despite the fact that they were knee deep in rich alfalfa ? brome grass ? ladino pasture and had access to rich bluegrass and white clover as well as certain wild grasses and weeds in an adjoining bottom pasture . From then on whenever we worked the gravel pit the heifers were on hand to pick up the dislodged roots as if they were special delicacies . I think the answer was that they found in the coarse tough roots a rich supply of minerals including a good many trace elements existing in a particularly concentrated form . These roots and crowns were of course exactly the part of the alfalfa which was turned into the soil to decay whenever we plowed down a sod ; and of course in their great numbers actually provided not only quantities of mineral fertilizer brought up from deep down but also provided fertilizer almost immediately available in ideal form to succeeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties of both alfalfa and the sweet clovers on so-called " worn-out " land or even upon rich land . While the gravel bed which we opened was clean washed and virtually devoid of clay or loam , the same remarkable mixture of small stones and boulders exists together with clay loam throughout all of our glacial drift soils at Malabar . Elsewhere in areas where the actions of water has not washed the gravel and sand quite clean the proportion of clay loam to gravel is , of course , much higher . Nevertheless , the same process was clearly taking place over the whole of the farm , even in the comparatively small area of pure yellow clay . I know of no more vivid example , plainly evident to the eye , of the remarkable efficiency of lime , grass and legumes in rebuilding soils than was revealed to us from the moment we first opened the gravel pit . It  | illustrated as well the fact that once the cycle of birth , growth , death decay and rebirth is established , fertility of all kinds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of commercial fertilizer or leached down to lower levels , becomes available once more and with it healthy and abundant crops become possible again . At the moment we are endeavoring to discover the proper ratio between the amount of mineral fertility exported from the farm in the form of food to the amount of mineral fertility released each year through the cycle mentioned so many times . This is a ratio difficult to establish because of the intricacy in the operations of nature . When it is taken into account that a steer weighing eight hundred to a thousand pounds will remove approximately roo pounds of calcium from the soil on which he is grown and that there are countless dairy cows which turn out fifty pounds upward of milk per day containing a high calcium content , it becomes evident that the drain on all minerals and on calcium in particular is considerable and may easily be out of ratio with the released , available , natural fertility of the land upon which the forage the animal consumes winter and summer is grown . At Malabar we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only know what has happened and what we have seen and have made deductions accordingly . These observations have been included in this chapter , " Grass , the Great Healer , " because grass and legumes and the lime which makes possible their growth and their abundance are perhaps the most important links in the whole of the cycle . Without the limestone and without the moisture , the soil maintenance , the great quantities of nitrogen and of organic material contributed by the grass and legumes , any soil will decline quickly to a condition in which erosion and either aridity or saturation , according to the topography and type of soil , become problems and the natural fertility becomes locked and unavailable to plants , animals and people . Conversely they are the means by which the whole cycle of fertility and its perpetuity may start again . There are dead soils and living soils . The dead soils are those in which some link of the cycle has been broken and the whole process ceases to operate . They are the soils which produce poor plants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cycle operates freely , produce plants , animals and people which are vigorous , fast growing and resistant , and people with physiques , intelligence , energy and initiative . As Dr. Jonathan Forman has pointed out ? " We are very largely what we eat . " If we do not succeed in providing artificially or releasing by natural  | processes the varied minerals and elements vital to the existence of healthy , vigorous and intelligent people , we in this country shall become merely a people like the great bulk of Asiatic peoples who continue to exist and survive merely through the most brutal and ruthless biological operations of Darwinian law of survival of the fittest . In all of this , the question of diet , so emphasized during the past two or three generations , becomes of secondary importance to the mineral and vitamin content of foods included in a given diet . In other words , the most carefully balanced diets in the world become ineffective if the materials included in those diets are deficient in minerals and vitamins . This mineral and vitamin content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the materials of the diet are grown . In other words , the finest , best balanced diet in the world , grown on some of the viciously depleted soils of the Deep South or even in some parts of the once fabulously rich Corn Belt , would have very little effect in raising the health , energy and intelligence of the people living on those soils . Even the field of nutrition , appearing to the superficial observer to be far removed from grass and legumes , has in reality , a very close relation to grass and legumes , for grass and legumes play the key role in making available the mineral richness of the earth . The richest soils on the earth ? the prairie corn belt and the vast midwestern plains , the black soil belts of Texas , the Ukraine , Mississippi and Alabama ? are essentially grass and legume-made soils , existing primarily owing to the reserve of calcium in the form of disintegrated limestone or in a form transmuted through the cycle birth , growth , death and decay into a high degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to grass and legumes for our health , our vigor , our intelligence and indeed for our very existence . One has only to live in close contact and observation of their miraculous healing properties on worn-out and organically depleted soils to understand the part they have played in fertility and in man 's growth and development since the beginning of time .  | VII : SOME MORE ANIMALS Brought four puppys , that is three dogs and a bitch distinguished by the following names viz. that with the most black spots Vulcan , the other black-spotted dog Searcher , the red-spotted dog Rover , and the red-spotted bitch Sweetlips . ? George Washington 's Farm Journal SYLVESTER is a Guernsey bull . He is the biggest Guernsey bull I have ever known and one of the handsomest . He is also the biggest baby I have ever known . He came to us from George von Penen who has a farm near Kalamazoo , accompanied by a harem of thirty-four lady friends , of all ages from six months to an old girl of thirteen . At Malabar he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he occupied , as Lord and Master , the big stall and bull pen in the dairy barn at the Big House save for occasional periods when he was allowed a holiday in lush pasture with the dairy cows and young heifers . On his arrival he was a young fellow , not quite two years old and he continued to grow and put on weight and muscle for almost another year , but from the first he revealed the fact that there was a broad streak of ham actor in him . He was always a poseur and as if aware of his own good looks , he spent a great deal of time in the bull pen , striking attitudes and showing his profile to anyone who would care to stop and look at him . Occasionally , the plastic pose would be interrupted by pawing and snorting and playing with the big iron oil drum which was given him as a plaything . I think he made up stories about the oil drum , converting it most  | often into a rival when he would give it an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the slope of the bull pen . When it struck the wall of the barn it would rebound and start rolling downward back toward him . At just the right point he would give it another almighty butt so that it repeated the action . This game would go on for sometimes as long as an hour . It began , I think , as his own idea of fun and exercise but gradually like all his other actions it took a showoff form . The spectacle was exactly like that of a middle-aged businessman playing handball and showing anyone concerned or interested that he was just as young as he ever was . The larger the audience the more enjoyment Sylvester appeared to gain from his performance . In the meanwhile he developed as well some of the characteristics of a spoiled Persian cat . Unlike most bulls he appeared to enjoy petting . Inside his stall , he would come and thrust his head over the edge of the barrier to be petted and talked to . I think it was the sound of my voice or Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'd say to him , " Well , how 's the old stinker today ? " and there would be a kind of answering deep rumble from his throat . And then " Want some attention , do you ? " and again a rumble . The eyes which a moment before had been showing the whites in his performance in the role of the big , bad bull , would half-close with pleasure . Usually the petting and conversation was accompanied by a treat of some kind ? a handful of grain or a fresh ear of sweetcorn or an apple . He knew perfectly well what " Do you want an apple ? " meant . Also he clearly knew what we meant when we asked , " Want some attention , do you ? " Only one thing tempted him away from the pleasure of being petted and talked to and that was the presence of ladies who frequently took a timorous attitude toward him . The moment they would start back and , in a feminine way , cry out , " But are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ham in him would come to the surface and he would begin at once to arch his neck , to snort , show the whites of his eyes and to flex all the great muscles of his handsome neck . No ham actor , strutting through the lobby of the Hotel Astor , ever did such a job . Indeed , the performance was so impressive that I once had a letter from a lady visitor on her return home begging me " not to trust that ferocious ' bull " for a moment . Of course I did n't trust him , nor did Al or Jim , because no sensible farmer ever trusts a bull . Many a farmer has been killed by a playful and friendly bull who was n't ferocious at all but " simply did n't know his strength . " Any farmer knows the playfulness of a bull calf and how  | he will put his head against you and push . A lot of calf remains in a lot of bulls after they are grown , only by that time the pushing is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sylvester has a lot of play in him but I would n't want to play with him if I were sandwiched between the wall of his stall and his big head . He carries his clowning , his hamming and his posing with him into the lush green ladino and bluegrass pasture . I think he realizes that here , in grass up to his knees the blue sky and the woods for a background , he is at his best , and certainly he is a handsome beast . As if he knew it , he plays the Lord to all the cows and heifers . When you first turn him out he does not , like many an eager , unwise male , run wildly to join the cows and heifers . Instead , he steps inside the gate and , striking a pose like the Bull Durham advertisement , lets out two or three ungodly bellows and waits . There is both lordliness and assurance in his manner and he has never had reason to change his tactics for within two or three minutes the silly cows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a hill , high-tailing it toward him . Then for a while he paws and bellows and poses , permitting them to admire him . He has an infallible instinct for those who are afraid of him and bullies them unmercifully . Only this autumn he discovered he could bully Jesse . Now Jesse , who is himself a character , is sixty-five and a man of all jobs with all the raciness and profanity of the Tennessee hills , and a word-by-mouth account of his encounter and feud with Sylvester can not be set down here with any degree of literalness . Jesse and Sylvester occupied the same pasture while Jesse was engaged with the Ford tractor in ripping it up for reseeding and Sylvester took to leaving his harem and following Jesse about . So long as the tractor was moving it was all right but once it stopped , Sylvester closed in on him . I doubt that he meant any real harm but he knew he could rouse from Jesse a fine stream of Tennessee four letter words and he also knew that he could keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no peace . He had to keep on the move from the time he entered the field until he left . Two or three times , standing on the top of the hill , I have watched the comedy . But worst of all , Sylvester would n't let Jesse get a drink at the spring . It was unseasonably hot October weather and Jesse got thirsty , but during the week he worked in the field he never once had a drink from the spring . Each time that Jesse turned the tractor in that direction Sylvester , as if divining his purpose , got there first . He even went further than that ; when he tired of following Jesse about , he  | simply went back to the spring and lay down beside it . He knew perfectly well all the time that Jesse was scared of him . But his behavior with Al and Jim and myself was quite different . If we encountered him in the field from the safety of the jeep or on the opposite side of the fence , he would begin his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusement for a time , all you needed to say was " Aw , Nutz ! Come over here and get your head scratched ! " And at once the snorting , the pawing and the eye-rolling stopped and he would walk over to the fence or the jeep and have his head rubbed like a pet calf . Sylvester has never quite understood the jeep . He dislikes all machinery and puts on a terrific show whenever a truck or a tractor comes into the barnyard . I think trucks and tractors and jeeps puzzle him because he can not figure out why Al and Jim and I can be his good friends on foot and then suddenly become part of a noisy chugging , Behemoth . In the pasture he will come up to the jeep and after his usual show-off performance , smell it , regard it from all sides , clearly and profoundly puzzled . He could of course demolish it if he chose and once or twice he has put his big head against the radiator with every intention of doing so , but a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and back again into his chronic state of bewilderment . His pasture behavior eventually resulted in a climax , however , when he went berserk and apparently decided that the only sublimation of his dislike for machinery was to break it up . There came the day when Sylvester actually attacked two tractors and chased Jesse and Kenneth from the field . Both were small-sized Ford tractors and Sylvester , instead of merely following them about bellowing and pawing , actually went for them . With his tail high in the air , the whites of his eyes showing and with tremulous bellows he put his head under the back end of the field cultivator and lifted it off the ground . Jesse , seeing himself and the tractor rolling down the hill , jumped free and took to the woods . Flushed with his victory , Sylvester set out after Kenneth and repeated the performance with the same results . Then while Jesse and Kenneth watched from the safety of the woods on the opposite side of the fence , he put on a show of regal triumph , posing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at last when he felt he had shown off sufficiently , he turned and rushed up the hill and out of sight to rejoin his harem leaving Kenneth and Jesse to return sheepishly and rescue their tractors . It is a pity that Sylvester could not hear Jesse 's subsequent account  | of " The Battle of the Tractors . " With each retelling it grew in detail and horror until Sylvester had attained the size of an African elephant and the ferocity of a sabre-toothed tiger . Fire came from his nostrils and sparks from his eyes . The tractor , in Jesse 's later versions , was lifted in the air so high that he had to jump several feet to the ground , just in time to save himself . Indeed , Jesse 's account of the Battle has reached such proportions that beside Sylvester , Paul Bunyan 's Blue Ox was no more than a sucking calf . Sylvester developed a lot of idiosyncrasies in his stall and bull pen . The one thing he can not bear is lack of attention or being ignored . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least speaking to him , he will put down his head and pout and grumble like a small child . And at some period and for some reason no one has been able to divine , he took a dislike to the top bar of the gate to his bull pen . At first this was a plank which he proceeded to break in two . When it was replaced he broke the second one and when a steel pipe was substituted he proceeded to bend it and force it out of position . Finally Al left the top bar off altogether and there remained only the lower bar less than three feet from the ground . Despite the fact that he could step over the remaining bar he has never attempted to do so nor made any effort to leave the pen , even though the cows pass him on their way from the milk parlor . It is useless to replace the top bar for he proceeds at once to smash or bend it . Apparently the top bar seems to present what psychiatrists refer to as " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is necessary . Visitors , seeing him with nothing between him and the outside world , take alarm and say , " Are n't you afraid he 'll get out ? " Ile never does . Perhaps some day he will and we shall have to take other measures . The day finally came however when Sylvester got his come-uppance and made a complete fool of himself . It was all his own doing and he was , I think , properly humiliated . For days afterward he became selfconscious and ashamed . My first knowledge of his predicament came when I began to hear the most prodigious bellows coming from the dairy barn as I was working in my office . He has a good voice , Sylvester , and is never hesitant about using it , but on this occasion the bellows were more like those of a bull elephant ringing from hill to hill in the jungle . Realizing something terrific must be happening , I went toward the barn and as I reached the corner in sight of the bull pen , I discovered a spectacle which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | The head of the oil drum which Sylvester used in his version of handball had apparently rusted out and in some way he had got his head inside the drum where it became firmly stuck . Blind and helpless , he grew madder and madder , and the madder he got , the more he bawled , with variations basso profundo , tenor and even coloratura . No bull-not even the Bull of Bashan ? ever bellowed louder . It was no use trying to get the oil drum off without aid . It was really stuck over his horns . It finally took two of us half an hour to free Sylvester . Once freed , he appeared momentarily dazed . Then he gave us both one of the most baleful looks I have ever received from an animal , grumbled once or twice , turned his back and went into his stall where he sulked the remainder of the day . Since then , although I have not relaxed my caution , I feel that I have Sylvester under control . I need only say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion . One of the most remarkable things about animals is the variety of their personalities and the fantastic tricks which , untaught , they will develop . To the average town dweller and even to some farmers all cows or hogs or horses appear to be alike and indistinguishable in characteristics and behavior , but nothing could be less true . A good stockman must have , it seems to me , three characteristics : ( 1 ) He must know and love his animals and divine the fact that they are sick or off their feed and what is the matter with them . ( 2 ) He must have a " feeling " for them so strong that he can virtually divine what they are thinking and what they are up to . ( 3 ) And in a broad sense he must treat them as companions . The 4-H Club boy , showing his prize steer or lamb or hog in Kansas City or Chicago or Omaha or Cleveland , will know what I mean . Many a time I have seen a boy sound asleep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steer which he will not leave , and twice at least I have seen tears in the eyes of a farm boy when the moment came to put the steer up for auction . Any good dairyman knows every cow in his herd and knows that each one of them is different in personality from all the others and that the understanding of this fact and treatment based upon it means money in the milk pail . The forty-cow dairy at Malabar is located only a hundred feet from the Big House and I spend a good deal of time there so that I have come to know all the cows pretty well , although nowhere nearly so well  | as Al and Jim who milk and care for them . In some remarkable way , beyond my own powers , Al and Jim know by sight all the forty milking cows and the twenty odd which in rotation are dry and awaiting calves . They know them by name and personality and when the boys open the door of the loafing shed many of the cows will come forward at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many cows in the dairy as well as sixty or seventyfive new heifers each year which eventually pass through the milking parlor for a season before being shipped to the eastern milk sheds , the naming of them long ago became a problem which we solved by naming them for the women and children on the farm and for visiting friends . There are Mary and Dessi and Virginia and Martha and Gwenn , Hope and Allen and Anne and Fanny and so on . At times the custom leads to mirth and broad jokes : Al or Jim announces " Jenny freshened last night ! " or " Wow ! Did Fanny kick me in the behind tonight ! " or " Myrtle has come in with six teats ! " There is Irene who will take on the milking machine peacefully until she is three-quarters milked and then begin to let fly with rabbit punches which could break your leg . And Essie , a big Holstein , who outdoes even the other Holsteins in her greed and will rattle her stanchion violently until she gets an extra handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will follow you about to be petted . Each one is capable of her own set of tricks . Some will not have their heads touched and others will rumble and purr like cats when you scratch their ears . Jean , who clearly has a sense of rhythm , will chew her cud in time to the music from the milk parlor radio , alternating waltz time with rhumbas and fox trots . I think she takes pride in entertaining visitors with her performance , for she gives occasional backward glances ( without losing a beat ) at a sudden outburst of mirth at her performance . But oddest of all performances was the feud which developed between Eileen and Mummy , the big female tiger cat who has staked out the feed room as her territory and does a first-rate job on the mice and rats who come to the milk parlor to feed off the spilled grain . Mummy was so named because of her extraordinary fecundity . In astrological realm she is probably what is known as the Universal Mother . Naturally she lives in close companionship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows them apart . Long ago she learned that by walking along the concrete ledge beyond the feed trough she would get some extra petting when the cows occasionally reached out and licked her coat as she passed . When this happens , she will stand quite still , arching her  | back and purring . It is a performance she carries out regularly at milking time , as much a rite as the milk which she receives twice a day . All went well with the system until Eileen , a very big and greedy Holstein , took an unaccountable dislike to Mummy . I suspect Eileen felt that Mummy had designs on her allotment of grain but I do not know . In any case there came an evening when Mummy , walking along the ledge receiving the usual attentions from the cows , was seized by Eileen and given a good shaking . Al heard the catlike yowls of distress and discovered the astonishing sight of Mummy being shaken by Eileen . With her tail spread to balloonlike proportions and all four feet dangling in the air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment Al was so paralyzed by laughter he could not rescue the indignant cat . A cat is the most dignified of all animals and no animal so resents a violation of its dignity . It was this violation , I think , which outraged Mummy far more than any harm she received by Eileen 's astonishing un-cowlike behavior . Twice more the incident was repeated , once in my sight , and by that time Mummy had had enough . She did not abandon her habit of parading the ledge behind the feed troughs . She simply gave it up while Eileen was in her stanchion being milked . As soon as Eileen was unlocked and released from her stanchion , Mummy resumed her promenade receiving with purring satisfaction the attentions of her bovine friends . The life of cats about a farm is in itself worthy of a whole study . They come and go from one set of farm buildings to another , according , so far as I am able to make out , to the rise and fall of food supplies . No animal but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have a score of farm cats , fat and sleek and well fed on mice , rats and unwary sparrows , as well as on the milk from the dairy barn and the table scraps from the houses . In summer some of the big toms will take to the fields and thickets leading a sporting life and living off the countryside . More than once when mowing , I have started up out of the thick hay a big torn engaged in stalking field mice . I do n't like it when they take young birds and chipmunks but there does n't seem to be any way of controlling them and in the barns they are not only valuable but indispensable , prowling the rooms , the feed mows and the cattle stalls to keep down vermin . The number which " goes wild " in summer is small for they are well fed in the barns and find an easy living there and at the kitchen doors of the various houses .  | Gilbert , the Tom turkey , is dead and Haile Selassie , the Karakul ram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the minor heroes of Pleasant Valley was part of an experiment . He was a wild turkey brought in to cross with bronze turkey hens in the hope that we might produce crossbred hens that would display some sense in taking care of their poults . Our valley is natural wild turkey country and the early settlers of Ohio depended on wild turkey for a substantial part of their game diet , and it occurred to us that turkeys , like the guinea fowl and the fighting chickens , might well breed and reproduce on their own , living off the land in summer and on spilled grain and a little handstrewn grain in winter . I had memories of my grandmother 's turkey hens who would hatch out a dozen poults , take them on the countryside for the summer and return with them nearly grown by the first heavy frosts . But no such thing happened . Man , by breeding turkeys to produce all breast or for quick fattening , seems to have bred out of the turkey hen the little sense she once had . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of her young , she can not even take care of herself . She is just a plain damned fool . And even the crossbred offspring of Gilbert showed little more sense than their overbred mothers . The original flock of six went on living about the house as privileged guests until they died off one by one of old age . Gilbert got to be a nuisance for he liked people better than he liked his hens , and spent all his time strutting among them . At times his gobbling made conversation by daytime impossible just as at times the raucous squawking of the guinea fowl in the catalpa tree by the door of the Big House made life intolerable in the evening . The situation was not helped in any way when the parrot abovestairs in the children 's rooms took to giving imitations of both Gilbert and the guinea fowl which were even noisier than the originals . The parrot was in himself a remarkable bird . Although he was with us until the children went off to school for good and his tyranny became unbearable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an egg but he was a confirmed man-hater and showed a great preference for the ladies . During all the years he was with us he never was locked in his cage but late at night he would enter it at what he thought was the proper time , go to bed , take his place on his perch and close his eyes . Occasionally he would make excursions from one of the children 's rooms to another but he never made any attempt to escape . There were  | moments when all of us wished he would take it into his head to fly for the Jungle . All the children are girls and Nanny shares their part of the house so that there were no men to speak of who could bother him until the girls began to grow up and have boy friends . Then , to put it in an unrefined way , all hell broke loose , and his persecutions could only be controlled by putting him inside the cage and throwing a cover over it . This failed to put him to sleep before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to swear , mutter , and grumble until he fell asleep at last . He was an exceedingly clever bird . No one ever attempted to teach him anything but he picked up plenty . Besides learning to imitate Gilbert , the gobbler , and the guinea fowl , he learned to whistle for the dogs and would spend hours at the window alternating shrill whistles , remarkable for their human quality , with sardonic and mocking chuckles . For three or four days after he began practicing the trick lie had the dogs crazy but with their sharp hearing they soon learned  | that Thomas was a fraud and ignored him , I almost suspect , to his fury . Then one day he began practicing on a new noise and for some time we were all baffled in our attempts to discover what the strange sounds he made were intended to imitate . There was no doubt that he was attempting something complex and difficult , as if a violin player were suddenly attempting to be a whole quartet , or a quartet a whole symphony . There would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gabble-gabble-gabble " with occasional shrill stretches which appeared to be music , interspersed without rhyme or reason by almost maniacal screeches . He would spend whole mornings practicing in his window directly over the main summer porch . Later , if not too hoarse , he would continue into the evening while we sat below . For a time , we thought that the noise was possibly a manifestation of parrot schizophrenia . And then one night , after weeks of practice , the imitation took enough form to be recognizable . I might not have understood what it was meant to be save for the fact that , returning from the barn one night in the darkness , I found myself at a spot on the lawn at equal distance from the group of family and friends on the porch and from Thomas at his post in the window overhead . The people below were talking and laughing to the accompaniment of music from the radio inside the house , and upstairs in his window Thomas was practicing . From where I stood , the sounds came to me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been practicing for weeks to imitate the sounds of human conversation , laughter and radio music which rose night after night during the summer to his window . When I reached the porch I said , " Would you all like to know what you sound like ? " There was a silence and from abovestairs Thomas ' imitation came out " gabble-gabble-gabble " with interludes of shrill music interspersed with insane giggles and maniacal chuckles . He had very nearly perfected it and it was good . What would have happened to him if he had been exposed to an average cocktail party I do not know . Very likely he would have burst apart in an explosion of flesh , bone , and feathers . Where he came from I do not know . We bought him from one bird dealer who had bought him from another and his origins were lost in antiquity . We had only three clues to his past life ? his hatred of men , his passion for toast soaked in coffee , and his habit of shrieking on occasion in an unmistakably feminine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ! "  | There came a time when Thomas ' disagreeable and cantankerous personality became a strain , perhaps because he developed a habit of deliberately scattering the hulls of his sunflower seeds as far as he could over the whole of the room . I suspect that he enjoyed watching someone clean them up so that he could scatter a fresh lot . In any case Thomas finally went too far when he began actually attacking any man who entered the room where he was . My novelist friend David deJong , on a visit at Malabar , told us that he had a way with parrots and he was sure that he would get on with Thomas . Despite protests and warnings he went upstairs to court the wicked bird . We had not long to wait for within three minutes David came down the stairs at full speed with Thomas clinging to his shoulders beating him frantically with his wings . Shaken off , the evil bird remained strutting and chortling about the front hall until Nanny , clad only in her nightgown , appeared from abovestairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cage on the floor and he immediately hopped on it and was carried back upstairs , chortling and leering back at us over his shoulder . At times he was amusing but he was always a malicious bird without warmth or any humor save the most savage and bitter derision , and as he grew older and dirtier he became an untidy and shrewish burden like some malicious old man . We returned him to the bird store and the proprietor sold him to an elderly and very plain widow living alone . I think it unlikely that his antipathy to men is aroused very frequently and I am sure the widow has plenty of time to clean up after him . I suspect that both are now happier if indeed happiness or unhappiness ever played any part in Thomas ' life . The Karakul ram was named Haile Selassie because he bore , with his dark face , hooked-nose and drooping ears so striking a resemblance to the King of Kings , the Lion of Judah and the Emperor of Abyssinia . Given to the children by Mrs. Grove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shiny black wool , he grew into an enormous ram with horns which curved twice round his drooping ears . Always he considered himself a member of the family and until he took to butting and hooking with his horns the guests and strangers ( in the playful way he had ) he ran free about the garden and the barnyard . In Pleasant Valley I wrote of Haile Selassie and of his reception of the Commissar of Animal Husbandry from Moscow whom he butted  | through the front door of the Big I-Iouse . The Commissar took it very well and in a mixture of French , German , and Russian , remarked , holding his posterior , " It made me feel that I was back again in Russia . " There was perhaps something cryptic in the remark which we have never fully understood . After that incident Haile was shut up in the paddock across the road where , with a Karakul and a Shropshire ewe , he led a fairly contented existence , like a Pasha with one Nubian and one Circassian bride . During this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarettes and would come running from any distance for one or the other . As I have never learned to chew tobacco without getting sick and Haile developed his tastes during the cigarette shortage occasioned by the war , his appetites for tobacco became somewhat of a problem . This was especially true since the temptation to feed him tobacco was irresistible , as he stood with his forefeet on the bottom rail of the fence , his head peering over the top while he bleated for his tobacco . The problem was solved by saving all the cigarette ends and feeding them to Haile . Despite the warnings of the anti-cigarette league , he thrived on them . The end came , as I have recounted elsewhere in the Journal , when he knocked down Nanny while she was innocently engaged in picking blackberries within his territory . As there were many children on the farm and many visiting children , we could n't take the risk and so Haile and his harem went off to live with a neighbor who was embarking upon a joint poultry and Karakul lamb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be enjoying himself . Gilbert , the Tom turkey , who started all of this , died finally of old age . We found him dead one winter morning beside the pond . He was a venerable bird , who must have been ten or eleven years old at the time of his death . Although he was a nuisance at times with his gobbling , strutting and preening which kept interrupting conversations , we miss him . He was a bird of passionate likes and dislikes . If anyone teased him , the offense was never forgotten and Gilbert would attack his annoyer with claws and wings on sight and even pursue him down the drive . He had a special distaste for the driver of the bakery truck and used to follow the bakery truck all the way down the lane to the main road uttering a queer combination of angry and complaining cries . His bronze wives all preceded him in death from one reason or another but he left behind a relic in the form of a white Holland turkey hen who was spontaneously known by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her liking for Metropolitan Opera openings , her jewels , and for her wattled throat . She still lives about the house and has taken on " a companion " much younger than herself from whom she is inseparable . He arrived on the scene as a three-day-old chick , dyed a brilliant green , as an Easter gift . He quickly shed his dyed fluff and emerged as a handsome Leghorn rooster who got somehow the name of Tony . The fighting chickens would have no part of him and he attached himself to Gilbert 's white Holland widow . They make a devoted but somehow ridiculous couple and Tony has defied all the rules of poultry husbandry by leading a natural out-of-door life and becoming the handsomest show rooster I have ever seen in or outside a poultry show . There are plenty of other animals at Malabar like Jo , the Border Collie , who is scared to death of cows and Folly and Susie who are Boxers and so come of a race of watchdogs and fighters but who are excellent stock dogs and Tex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show-ring but has a passion and an unswerving instinct for rounding up cattle . And there are two Angus bulls called Junior and Pee-Wee . As Ellen , the youngest daughter once put it , " The trouble with the animals on this farm is that they all think they 're people . " GOOD-BY TO A FRIEND I had been fishing for three days among the islands of Lake Erie , escaping just ahead of a great equinoxial storm which shut the islands off from the mainland for three days . Friends drove me from Catawba clown to the farm with the rising wind and the towering black clouds just behind us all the way . We won the race , driving up the long lane , between trees whipped by the wind , scattering showers of early falling leaves across the road . The Big House had never looked pleasanter nor the farm more green than in the sulphur-yellow light from the approaching storm . But in my heart there was always that uneasy misgiving which always troubles me when I return after an absence . At Malabar t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizes and kinds which have a deep hold on my affections . And always there is a fear in my heart that , while I am away , something bad might have happened to one of them . It is the penalty , I suppose , for having affections and attachments . Life would be much simpler , I suppose , and the emotions less distressed if a man lived alone in a cave without either affections  | or attachments of any kind ; but life would also be less warm and less rich and infinitely and painfully sterile . Like all else , about which Emerson was so right in his clean , transcendental thinking , these things are a matter of compensation . Always when I have been away I am almost sure to be greeted , as the car comes up the lane , by my wife and a troop of dogs . There were always Prince and Baby , Gina and Folly , the four Boxers , Dusky , the Cocker and Jo , the Border Collie . Once there had been the great and venerable Rex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the black and livercolored Cocker , and Midge the Boxer pup , but they have been gone now for a long time , although the family talks of them as if they were still alive . It is always the dogs who give the signal of my approach and my wife , recognizing it , comes down the path from the house . On that wild September evening , the arrival of the car was heralded by the rush of dogs , but almost at once I saw that two things were wrong . Prince was not with the dogs , leading them as he always did , and the door did not open and my wife did not appear . Instead it was Tom who came out of the kitchen across the lawn . The old uneasiness rose again and then , as he unloaded the bags and fish , Tom was suddenly beside me and without even greeting me , he said , " Mr. B. , Prince is dead ! " " Dead ! " I asked , " What happened ? " " He was coughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He died during the night . " I knew now why my wife had n't appeared . She could n't face telling me because she knew about Prince and me . So Tom had been delegated and it was hard for him , so hard he did n't even accompany the news with the prelude of a greeting . I knew it was hard on him too because when my wife and I were away , Prince attached himself to Tom , following him everywhere all day long . Each morning when I wakened , Prince would get down from my bed , have his part of my breakfast and then go off to Tom in the kitchen to have his back brushed . Tom always used a whiskbroom . Animals and especially dogs are very conventional . The backbrushing was a regular ritual . My friends expressed sorrow at the news and I was grateful but they could n't know how I felt . I asked them in for a drink before they drove off to Columbus . My wife joined us and acted as if nothing at all had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue their race against the oncoming storm . When they had gone , my wife looked at me without speaking and  | I said , " I think I 'll go and have a look at the farm before dark . " She said , " I think that would be a good idea . " It was always Prince who went everywhere with me in the jeep . He loved it , partly I think , because it was open and he could catch every scent on the breeze as we drove and partly because in the jeep we went to the wildest parts of the farm where there were always squirrels and rabbits and woodchucks to chase . Now as I climbed in , Prince 's brother Baby , jumped quickly into the seat beside me . I was n't going to look over the farm. - I was going to one place where all of us on the farm go instinctively when we are worried or depressed or something unhappy occurs to us . I was going to the pastures of the Ferguson Place which lie high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lonely place which has no buildings , a farm which is all forest and bluegrass , but it is not lonely . My wife knew where I was going . Prince had slept on the foot of my bed since he was a fat puppy . Never once in the eight years of his life was he absent from his accustomed place . He spent twenty-four hours a day with me . If I moved across a room to another chair , he moved with me and lay down at my feet . People came to say that I did not own Prince : he owned me . And now as I drove up the long , wild lane through the woods , his brother Baby was beside me and something curious happened . Halfway up the Iane he leaped into my lap and began to lick my ear , exactly as Prince had done so many times when we set off alone together in the jeep ? as if the pleasure was always too great to be borne . It was exactly as if Baby knew . Baby had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to demonstrations of affection of any kind . The sudden outburst was so violent that I laughed and said , " That 's enough , Baby ! Let me alone ! I have to drive ! " And he quieted down for a moment only to break out a little later with another wild and affectionate assault . Boxers are big dogs and when they demonstrate their hearty affections the demonstrations can only be described as an assault . We reached the high farm just as the clouds of a storm were blackening out the last rays of the setting sun . There on the green pasture the Holstein heifers and Pee-Wee , the bull , were grazing quietly , scarcely looking up as the jeep drove among them , and then , when I had turned off the motor and climbed out , followed by Baby , to lie on the grass , the cattle came up one or two at a time to stand there , very close , watching the two of us . Baby did what Prince had  | always done . He sat close to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the peril of the docile heifers . I do n't know how long I lay there but the smell of the bluegrass and the friendliness of the heifers made the hurt seem a little less . This was a place where Prince had come with me countless times to sit in the evening looking down over the valley . It was all just the same . Despite the oncoming storm , the evening seemed quiet but for the wild beauty of the great black clouds touched at moments by the crimson and gold light of the setting sun . The thick woods shut out the rising wind and the only sound was the soft swishing , crunching sound made by the heifers and the bull as they ate their way along the bluegrass and white clover . Then there was a wild clap of thunder and another and another . I heard myself half-thinking , half-saying , " It 's all right , kid ! I 'm coming back ! Do n't worry ! " And I thought , " That 's silly ! " But somehow it made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I went away on a trip . He always knew all the signs . He knew what a suitcase meant . He grew worried and miserable even if I put on store clothes to go into town for a few hours . So I 'd always say , " It 's all right , kid ! I 'm coming back ! Do n't worry ! " And always when I came back I 'd say after I 'd recovered from the first affectionate assault of welcome , " You see , kid ! It 's all right ! I told you I 'd come back and I did . " He came to understand it all and although the sight of store clothes or a suitcase never failed to depress him , understanding the situation and knowing I was not leaving forever made it all easier for him . On the occasions when I went away he never rushed to the door with me but stayed behind in my room till the car drove off . Then as I lay there on the grass , Baby turned suddenly and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the threatening sky , the wild storm of the equinox broke . The heifers and Pee-Wee took to a sheltering thicket and Baby and I climbed back into the jeep to drive home down the wild , rough lane through a wild wind and a driving rain with flashes of lightning which illumined the very depths of the thick wood . I know that much of what I am writing sounds sentimental and much of it is . And so I am a sentimentalist and so what ? It is inevitable that anyone who likes and understands animals should be a sentimentalist . I think too that such people sometimes find in animals and especially dogs consolations and sympathy in time of hurt which no  | human , however close , can ever bring them . And there is much truth in the sentimentality about animals , much which brings a special warmth and satisfaction in living and a clue to much that is a part of understanding and of God . Some people will perhaps not understand at all what I am writing about and others will know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward Prince was always with me in a way for , as when great friends die , one thinks of them almost constantly ? they are indeed ever present in one 's dreams . And so I thought a great . deal about Prince , remembering all the small things about him and a hundred small incidents , good and bad . For he was a very human dog , neither wholly good or bad . He was willful and demanding in his love for me and very jealous . He fought with Baby and was even known to snip at Gina and Folly when they became too affectionate and intimate . Always in his mind , I was his special property . He was a big and handsome dog , the child of Rex , a noble father , and Regina , a mother with an immense store of feminine wisdom , calm , and poise . Rex died four years ago and Regina is still alive going her calm way , wise and affectionate and pleasant as a good wife and mother should be . She brooks no nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although she is quite an old lady she can quiet them all simply by making faces at them and she can make really ferocious and terrifying faces . Baby too is their child from a different litter from Prince . He was a year younger than Prince and no two dogs could be less alike , for Baby was always a clown and a ham actor . He holds long conversations in a variety of barks , whines , and growls . He taught himself to dive off the high platform at the pond and he can not resist climbing into an empty wheelbarrow for a ride . He drinks Coca-Cola from a bottle and water straight from the faucet . He developed all these tricks and many more without ever being taught . Ile was always vain and comical but detached . But Prince was different . Indeed he was different from any of the fifty or more dogs I have had in a lifetime . He was different because he was a Boxer and Boxers ' owners will know what I mean by that ? but lie was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good companion . To drive with him over the farm or to take him with me across the fields and woods was like having the company of a great friend who was intelligent and amusing . When I walked three or four miles , he would joyously run ten or fifteen , but in all his excursions he kept returning to me again and again to tell me what a beautiful morning it was or how  | he had treed a squirrel . And sometimes he would return with a woodchuck , proudly , to show me , and would insist on carrying it all the way home . He was obedient too for when he uncovered a nest of young rabbits or , as happened once or twice , came on a baby raccoon offside in the daylight , I needed only to say , " No , Prince ! " and he would stand quite still , quivering with excitement , without touching the young animals . And like all Boxers he was clever with his paws , using them with dexterity , almost like hands . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handles and these he turned easily , but he was very clever with round door knobs , using both paws to turn them . He went from room to room in the house and at the front door he would open the screen door and hold it open while he turned the knob of the inner door . Once his cleverness nearly caused disaster which might have ended in the death of himself and his wise old mother . I had left them inside the car on a slope above the deep pond below the Big House , planning to return quickly , but once inside the house a long-distance telephone call distracted me , and temporarily I forgot Prince and Gina , still waiting in the car . When at last I was free to return , I stepped out of the house just in time to see the big car with the two dogs inside slipping down the steep slope toward the deep waters of the pond . It was the dogs I thought of and not the car . Running down the slope I arrived at the pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface . Fully dressed , I went into the water , dived , opened the car door and dragged them both out under water . They swam ashore , shook themselves and seemed unconcerned over what had happened . Indeed , I think Prince took it as a lark . It did not take me long to divine what had happened . The car was heavy and the emergency brake never held it properly , so , on leaving them , I had put the car in second gear and turned the wheels against a nearby bank . Prince , left alone for so long , had grown impatient and tried to open the door to get out and find me . In doing so he had put one paw on the gearshift , pulling it out of second gear and turning the wheels at the same time away from the bank . The rest was easy ? the car simply rolled into the pond . It was Prance too who , on cold days , opened the doors of cars belonging to visitors and led the other dogs inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep out draughts . Many a time , a visitor has left my office to discover that the car he had left empty and closed was now filled by four Boxers and a Cocker Spaniel .  | He had the dignity and the nobility of his father , Rex , but with more sensitivity and intelligence , and this difference made him a sufferer , for he worried as I have never known any dog to worry . He worried about my going away and as soon as I returned , he would begin worrying lest I leave again . After the first roughhouse welcome on my return , he would be overcome again and again during the day by the realization that I had really come back after all , and at such moments he would leap from the floor into my lap and place both paws on my shoulders and lick my ear . Sometimes he would jump from the floor onto my big desk scattering ink and papers in his excitement . I could n't punish him . How could you punish such a whole-hearted demonstration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will talk and talk , very audibly to any circle of friends , but Prince rarely raised his voice . He would open his mouth and his lips would quiver but no sound would come forth , and then he would sigh as if he knew that no matter how hard he tried , he could never make with his dog 's mouth the articulate sounds of speech that I was able to do , that he could never really talk to me , no matter how much we understood each other . At such times I would say , " It 's all right , kid . I understand everything you say . " And immediately he would be happy again . It was a saying ' in the family that you could n't talk confidentially in front of Prince because he understood everything you said , and indeed lie appeared to understand perfectly all conversations or the plans made in his presence . Ile knew perfectly well how to wangle his way onto a sofa despite all rules to the contrary . He did it by degrees and insinuations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fresh chintz as if that was where he belonged . Like all Boxers he hated draughts or cold floors . Five or six dogs sleep in my bedroom . It is on the level of the garden with two doors which Prince opened easily , sometimes for himself and sometimes for the others . When the " coon huntin " season opened , life at night in my bedroom was not placid and sleep was interrupted , for after midnight when the neighboring boys started running their hounds , the sound of baying drifted down from the ridge across the ravine and the dogs in my bedroom knew there were strangers on what they considered their territory . With a whoop and a halloo they were off , led by Prince who opened the door . Then for an hour or two , all hell broke loose as the Boxers , with Dusky , the Cocker Spaniel trailing them , set out after the coon hounds , driving them out of the valley . Once the  | hounds were clear of the Boxers ' land , the Boxers all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter , to go back to their beds on chairs and sofas . Gina and Folly and Baby each had developed their own special ways of opening doors . Old Rex used to employ both teeth and paws . But none of them ever developed the proficiency of Prince . No door could withstand him and when he was with the others they always stood aside in deference to his particular skill . If any other dog even approached the bed at night , he was in trouble at once . But for the period of my after lunch nap , he had made some sort of an arrangement with Folly . I do not know when or how it was made but it was one of perfect understanding . He never prevented her from joining me at nap time and never made any attempt to push her aside or to take his accustomed place . But at night it was different , the rug at the foot of my bed belonged to him . That animals communicate and come to understandings , I have no doubt , for I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recall an afternoon when a group of visitors stopped at the lower garden with a strange Boxer in their car . It is always a risky thing to bring a strange dog in a car to Malabar for it is difficult to prevent the Boxers from removing half the paint from the car ; so on this occasion I held Prince by the collar and told my friends to leave the car down on the road where it would be concealed , with the strange dog inside . Together we walked up the long hill and when we arrived at the house , where three or four empty cars were parked , the other Boxers rushed out to greet us . Then after a moment 's exchange of communication they all began leaping at the windows of the empty parked cars , one after another , to discover which one contained a dog . Clearly and unmistakably Prince had spread the word . When they found all the cars empty , they returned with disappointment to sit by us on the lawn , still convinced that there was a strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to rise slowly on old Gina 's back . She sniffed the wind and suddenly , followed by the others , all save Prince , she set off at top speed down the hill toward the hidden parked car . The odd thing was that Prince did not follow . I think it was because I had warned him to leave the strange dog in peace . He had told them there was a strange dog in a car on the farm but he did not tell them where . In the mornings when I have breakfast in my office , each of the Boxers is given milk from a saucer . They have their own order of being served , apparently by arrangement among themselves . First Prince , as if this was  | his divine right as the leader and best friend of the boss , then old Gina , perhaps out of respect for her age , then Folly , the pretty , frivolous one and finally Baby , if he had not already gone out on the farm . The order never varied , nor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second helping . Prince was a sociable dog and a great welcomer . Like all the Boxers , he loved picnics and parties and after the first uproar of barking had died away , he would welcome and say a few words to every member of the arriving party . Boxers are ferocious in appearance but they have the hearts of big babies . Sometimes the welcome to a small child would create more consternation than pleasure . Like all Boxers he was wonderful with children , and on the farm and among the visitors , there are many children of all sizes . Instinctively a Boxer will take care of children . I have seen little fellows on the farm pinch and ride and bedevil the Boxers and even take bones from them without coming to any harm . When the assaults become unendurable the Boxers will simply walk away out of reach without any loss of dignity . On one occasion a small nephew of two years came to stay on the farm . He was one of those happy children with no fear of dogs and he moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but he adopted Prince and Prince adopted him . The bond became so great that he even insisted upon having his afternoon nap with Prince . He would play with Prince for long periods of time , climbing on him and rolling over him . The friendship reached a climax and a test one summer afternoon while he was rolling on the lawn with the big dog . To the surprise of his mother and the rest of us , the boy was observed biting Prince 's lip while the dog lay perfectly quietly with an expression not only of patience but of satisfaction . He had many friends from all over the world and whenever or whereever I met them , they always asked , " How is Prince ? " It was as if we belonged to each other and I know that when I was at home no one ever saw us separated , day or night . They asked about him as if he were one of the family . He liked people and remembered them when they returned , giving them a hospitable and friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands of the lake I should have enjoyed myself . I was among a dozen of my very best friends . We drank some and fished and played poker . We had an attractive and comfortable cottage and wonderful food . Yet , all the time I spent there I suffered from an unaccountable sense of depression and slept badly ,  | an exceptional thing in my experience . I tried to believe that it was the weather with the approaching equinoctial storms , but never quite persuaded myself . By the third day the depression had taken the form of foreboding , of what I did not know . Like Dr. Carrell who was certainly no sentimentalist but a great and pure scientist , I believe that there are in the realms of intuition , of telepathy , of psychic communication things as remote from our understanding or knowledge as the knowledge of the physiology of man is remote from the most primitive savage . I know that in those three days , when for every reason I should have experienced a happy , carefree enjoyment in the open air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimmed the whole of the holiday and gradually assumed the proportions of menace and foreboding . After returning with Baby through the storm from the high farm , I went to bed early and took a sleeping pill so that I would n't wake up and lie awake thinking about Prince . The place on the foot of the bed where he had always slept on an old green rug was empty for the first time since he had come there as a puppy . Presently I fell asleep but twice during the night I was wakened despite the sleeping pill , once by the feeling of something stirring and pressing against my leg . The feeling was so real and so intense that I thought one of the other dogs had taken Prince 's place . But when I sat up and reached down , there was nothing there . After a long time I fell asleep again only to be wakened this time by the sound of scratching on the screen door . It was exactly the sound made by Prince when , in wet weather , the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grille covering the lower part of the door and give it an extra tug . I listened for a moment and then concluded one of the other dogs had gone out and , without Prince to open the door for him , could not return . I put on the light and went to the door . The storm was over and the moon was shining high over the ravine . Outside the door there was nothing . The two experiences were not imagined nor were they the result of drowsiness for each time I lay awake for a long time afterward . I do not know the explanation ? save perhaps that no creature , in some ways even a human one , had ever been so close to me as Prince . For weeks before he died he had seemed melancholy and looked a little thin but I thought only that it was the hot weather . Then two days before he died he began to cough violently and my wife sent him up to Doc Wadsworth 's and thirty-six hours later he was dead of a  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer of the lung and could only have lived a few weeks longer , perhaps in pain . If I could not have been with him myself I was glad that he was with Doc Wadsworth and his wife and sister-in-law for they feel as I do about animals and particularly about Boxers . When Doc comes to the farm , they all rush out and leap all over him . On two occasions they have knocked him flat with their joyous and affectionate welcome . I 'm glad Doc was with him and gave him something to quiet the coughing and keep him asleep . But I wish I had been there to hold his head on my knee and say , " You see , kid ! It 's all right ! I told you I 'd come back ! " He 's gone to join old Rex and the charming , frivolous little Boxer , Midge , who was like a ballet dancer , and little Patsy , the cocker who used to act as " sitter " for Old Gina whenever she had puppies , and Dash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feeling that I 'll see them all some day and that as they rush down the path to welcome me with Prince in the lead , I 'll be able to say to him , " You see , kid . I told you I 'd come back and I did ! " The story perhaps would not be complete without relating the change in Baby in the days after Prince 's death . Baby was , in one sense , an orphan . He was the one pup who survived in a litter of Gina 's which she lost prematurely after she threw herself into the midst of a dog fight in a condition in which no lady can safely indulge in brawls . When her milk failed , Baby was put on a bottle and brought up by Venetia ' Wills , from England , who was staying out the war with us . Despite the unfortunate circumstances of Baby 's birth and upbringing he was : always a stout and hearty dog and early took to farm life . Of all the dogs , he has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fields riding on the machinery or following the plow . He is perfectly happy to follow the plow or mower round and round the field for hours , unlike his brother Prince who hated tractors and would leave me when I gave myself over to plowing . Unlike most Boxers , who dislike bad weather and hate rain , he has never minded either and in winter will sit in the snow looking down the road while the other dogs scratched at the door to be let in . I have recounted earlier Baby 's talents as a clown and a ham actor . His love for showing off frequently brought him into trouble with the other dogs , male and female , who detested the showing-off and when he began high diving would pounce on him to beat him up . He  | would certainly have been a great dog performer in vaudeville or a circus if he had ever had the opportunity . During the whole lifetime of Prince , I had thought of Baby as a peculiarly impersonal dog , egotistical and less affectionate than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered how badly I had misjudged him . I discovered that he only appeared indifferent and egotistical because Prince , in his devotion to me and his jealousy , would not permit him to be otherwise . It was the ancient , classic case of the domination of the older brother . I know that whenever Baby tried to be friendly with me , a light of fury would come into Prince 's eyes and a ferocious fight , sometimes damaging to tables , glassware and lamps would ensue . I did not , however , realize that Baby was really a frustrated dog and that all his tricks and showing-off were in a way merely a device to get attention and praise . He behaved exactly as a child behaves under the same circumstances , especially a child who seeks to attract notice away from a more favored brother or sister . I do not know how much he understood immediately concerning the death of Prince , but he came presently to realize that Prince was no longer there to attack him when he entered the room where I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jeep . For weeks after the death of Prince he never entered the house or my room save walking on tip-toe , his back arched and bristling , as if expecting attack . Gradually the old apprehension and complex began to disappear and his behavior became more normal . Then it was that I came to understand his troubles . I discovered that the big dog was perhaps the most affectionate of all the Boxers . He really did n't want to be a show-off . Ile only wanted attention and all the privileges Prince had had . He developed Prince 's trick of jumping eagerly into my lap or on my desk . His whole character seemed to change . Instead of seeming to alternate between moodiness and showing-off , his temperament became even and happy . He still carries on his long conversations , conducted with a remarkable variety of rumbles , growls , barks , and whines ; they are no longer complaints but outbursts of happiness . And gradually he became as inseparable from me as Prince had been . One thing , however , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of command or blandishment to take Prince 's place on the rug at the foot of my bed . He would hold long conversations obviously iii an effort to explain the situation to me but nothing would induce him to take the place of his brother . He clung always to the smallest chair which as a puppy he had chosen as his bed although he had long  | grown into a severity pound dog whose head and stub-tail overhung both arms of the chair . But he has become a happy dog with less and less inclination to do his tricks . He has moved into the place left by Prince which long ago had been occupied by their father , old Rex . He is Boss ! There is a new puppy , out of Folly 's latest litter , who is growing up ? this time Baby 's son . I hope to do better by both of them and prevent the frustrations that turned Baby into an unhappy show-off . The thing that is most endearing about dogs , and especially about Boxers , is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so profoundly like children .  | Spring 1945 Have you become a farmer ?

Thomas Jefferson in a letter to Henry Knox , Boston Bookseller MARCH A long gap , but there seems no end to demands on time . The deep snow has gone and the spring came suddenly in two or three days with brilliant sun and a few showers . I hope it is here to stay . The suddenness put a quick end to sugar-making . Good maple syrup weather means cold freezing nights alternating with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost hot and all the sap has rushed up out of the ground into the high branches and twigs , swelling the buds and casting a faint cloud of pinkish green over the whole of the woods . While the sugar run lasted , the camp became as always the center of farm life . Even Ma had to clump through the mud with her cane . It brought back very old memories of her father 's day . On Sundays neighbors and people from town kept coming and going all day . It was like a festival marking the wakening of the New Year . Certainly it is one of the most pleasurable ceremonies and in these times of sugar shortage it is good to have the storeroom full of maple syrup and honey .  | Chris Hugert who has taken care of the bees for years gave it up this year to go permanently to live in New Mexico because of his health , and Sunday his cousins came to take over the job ? a pair of big , hearty countrymen , very different from poor asthmatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bees in four of them were dead . It has been a hard winter for bees with the snow drifted high up around the hives and the temperature always close to zero with many blizzards . There seemed to be plenty of honey for them still to feed on . The shortage was in pollen but the quick turn to spring has brought out all the catkins and crocuses and all around them the air buzzes with the sound of wings . I would like to care for the bees but it is one of the most complicated professions in the world . The person who thinks that all one has to do to have honey is to put up a couple of hives has much to learn . There is a book ? a very thick one ? called The A.B.C . of Bees , but to me it is more confusing than a book on advanced mathematics . Today Kenneth , Bob , and I built fences between the lower bluegrass pasture and the cemetery field . It was a brilliant day and that corner of the farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowl with the big trees of the virgin forest on one side raising their top branches a hundred feet and more above the sugar camp . A spring stream wanders through the pasture with ox-bow ponds filled with young fish and bordered by water cress , marsh marigold , and skunk cabbage . The steep cemetery field is planted to wheat which has grown prodigiously in a few warm days and looks like a carpet of emerald green velvet . All the dogs ? Prince , Baby , Gina , Susie , Folly , Kitchee and Smokey ? played in the fields and chased squirrels and lay flat in the shallow water when they grew hot and tired . George Cook came down when the school bus dropped him off , his pockets filled with marbles , another sign of spring . Jim hauled manure out of the Fleming barn on to the small garden to make it ready for plowing . Charlie already has onions , lettuce , radishes and beets planted . Yesterday he was in a rage because Charlie Schrack 's big red sows broke out , traveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done . I do n't blame him . The lower fish pond came to life today with a vengeance . It was filled with fingerling bass and the mud-turtles were scuttering about . I saw forty or fifty bass a foot to fifteen inches long . They are out scouting for nests in the shallow water covering the sand and gravel . The bluegills have not yet made their appearance . Taking the giant bass out of the pond last year was a good idea . They are cannibals and were eating up  | all the young . The increase in the number of fish is very apparent this year . There are still some big ones to be cleaned out . The dime-store goldfish the children dumped into the pond five years ago have grown monstrous in size and vivid in color . I saw several females today , enormous with roe . The goldfish never increase in number ? still the huge , venerable brilliant-colored originals . On the edge of the pond the first red-winged blackbirds have appeared in numbers , looking for nesting sites on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray Toulouse geese are fussing about on the islands making nests .

The geese can drive off the foxes but the snapping turtles get the goslings . Nor dc ' the guinea fowl ever lose a single chick from the foxes . I think they put up such an ungodly racket they drive them off . The upper pond at the Big House stayed frozen over all the winter and many of the fish died , from lack of oxygen and sunlight I suppose . When the ice melted there were several big dead bass , about four or five pounds each , a dozen bluegills and a huge carp , about fifteen to sixteen pounds , the only one in the pond . The children caught him in the Clear Fork as a young fellow and dumped him in . I thought carp could survive almost anything , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch today before leaving for Florida .

MAY 14 : Another long gap with abominable weather . Never can I remember a worse spring . The fantastically warm weather of March brought out everything ? alfalfa , bluegrass , ladino , fruit blossoms , garden flowers . The alfalfa and ladino were frozen back . All the new growth on the grapes froze as if it had been scalded . What magnolias the rabbits did not girdle and kill , froze in full flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild crab blossoms singed  | and without the wonderful perfume they usually have . The bluegrass and the wheat have turned yellowish . Added to all this were cold and torrential rains . By industry and luck we managed to plant 6o acres of oats which are flourishing although there has been too much rain and cold even for the oats which usually like that kind of weather . But we are much more fortunate than most for our well-drained glacial hill land permits us to plow in almost any kind of weather . Despite the awful season we are almost ready to plant sudan grass and soybeans when the frost is past . Even in this County only 25 per cent of the oats has been planted . In the flat country none is in the ground , and by the time the soil is dried enough to plow , it will be too late to put it in . This will have a serious effect on feed supplies for the condition is not confined to Ohio but in general all through the richest part of the country . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been fearing . We have had enormous luck with weather during the war . A " bad year " would be disastrous and affect the history of the world for generations to come . We have never been so short of food and the needs for ourselves and all the rest of the world have never been so great . Margaret Reed , who is always cheerful , pointed out that the late and violent freezes may do good by killing millions of insect pests which otherwise would have survived the mild snowy winter . Deep snow lay on the ground from December to March with the ground scarcely frozen ? a condition which is usually followed by hordes of corn borers , chinch bugs , grasshoppers , aphids and other pests . The spittle bug has already been working on the alfalfa . VE day has come and gone with few but the fools using the occasion as one of celebration . There is indeed very little to celebrate . Here we celebrated it by plowing all day ? as good a way as I can think of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our bottom land in the Muskingum Conservancy . It is our only really flat land ? two great fields , one of 90 acres and one of 70 . Most of it is fine gravel loam that turns beautifully under the plow , but it was worn out by generations of hog-greedy farmers and very nearly abandoned until we rented it . To bring it back we have been practicing a rotation of corn , oats , and sweet clover . It was Bob 's idea and a sound one for the land is too far from the barns to haul manure to it . This year the " catch " of sweet and mammoth clover which followed liming is thick and lush and green ? so beautiful that farmers came from all around to look at it . When you pull up a plant the roots are  | thick with nodules taking nitrogen from the air and fixing it in the worn-out soil . It is worth countless dollars per acre in expensive nitrogen fertilizer which we can not buy today even if we could afford it . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nitrogen and tons of the humus that the starved land needs so badly . No wonder that all of us look backward over the plow to watch the crumbling soil swallowing up all that richness . We came home at night with stiff necks and crooked backs from leaning over to watch . We have been trying a lot of experiments with the big field ? shallow plowing , deep plowing , burying all the green stuff and also setting the plows so that they do not completely bury it but set it on end mixing it into the earth . One strip we are Faulknerizing ? chopping it all into the earth with " bush-and-bog " harrows which are really heavy , superdisks . It will be interesting to see what the results will be after the corn is planted . It is the sort of thing which makes farming a fascinating occupation and a " live " one . Gradually we are becoming able to grow more and better corn on half the land . Perhaps presently we shall grow as much on a third of the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall be approaching the goal of making every acre produce ioo per cent of potentiality without loss of fertility , perhaps even , as in parts of Europe , with a gradual increase . The sweet clover is doing it with its wonderful capacity for lianslating sun and air and water into nitrogen and organic material . One thing I noticed this year while looking backward over the plow was the great increase in the population of earthworms . That is a good sign . The crows followed us as we plowed , unfortunately gobbling up some of the earthworm population . They are birds with scarcely a  | redeeming feature and in the Conservancy land they are a pest for it is surrounded by wild country and forest which gives them cover , where they gather in great colonies . Once the corn has begun to sprout they descend on the fields and tear it up grain by grain . We finally put an end to that by using something called Crow-tox applied to the corn before planting . It does not kill them but produces a burning sensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they soon connect the cause and effect and leave our fields alone . Clem Herring told me that he used to rid himself of them by using hen 's eggs into which he had injected strychnine through a small hole at one end sealing the hole afterward with paraffin . These he scattered about the fields . On several occasions he killed foxes instead of crows . Both are pests in our country and both are crafty and maddening . If you have a shotgun , they will come nowhere near you , but if you are unarmed , they become as bold as Moses . While we were plowing the Conservancy land all seven dogs were with me and the crows tormented them all afternoon , descending quite near to them in a tantalizing way , only to leave the ground just as the maddened dogs came within a foot or two of them . They would chase the crows for an hour and then go down to the Clear Fork and throw themselves into the water , swimming about and lapping the clear , cold water greedily , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy it although they got not so much as a crow feather as a reward . The Clear Fork Valley is unbelievably beautiful with the steep wooded hills all about it , the lake mirroring the blue sky and the trees ranging in shade all the way from the black-green of the hemlock against the red sandstone cliffs through all the soft pastel shades of green , some of it pink and yellow and pale red . The young foliage of the red oaks is 4 a deep pink so that it makes the tree appear as if it were covered with deep pink blossoms . The white dogwood and the pink wild crab grow all along the edge of the forest above the water , and through it all runs the wide thick carpet of pale emerald-green sweet clover , slowly turning to brown as the earth swallows it up behind the tractors that move across the field like shuttles on a gigantic loom . There is no smell quite so good as fresh-turned sweet earth , and all afternoon it was tinged with the vanilla-like smell of sweet clover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ma came with me and the dogs in the old Ford station wagon and sat there with her sewing all afternoon watching the plowing . She  | brought a gallon jug of fresh buttermilk which we kept cool in the running spring water and drank when we grew thirsty . It was buttermilk made of sweet cream with little flecks of golden bluegrass butter floating in it . Once during the afternoon , I thought , " Paradise must be like this . " After supper we returned to the plowing and Harry and Naomi joined us with their three small children . Harry entertained them by carrying them in turn on his lap as he drove the tractor . In the old days they would have ridden on the fat back of a Percheron . It is remarkable how much children like machinery on a farm . One of our worst problems is to keep them off it . Even " Butch , " George 's nephew , and George Cook who are only seven have figured out how to drive a tractor and get aboard the moment you turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they sometimes are of horses . We stayed out until nearly dark ? Jim , Kenneth , Harry and I ? plowing , until a wild thunderstorm came up . We tried to beat it in a race back to the house but lost the race and came in drenched . JUNE 6 : May has whizzed by with some of the worst weather we have had in the history of Ohio . The freakish spring has been disastrous . The hot weather in March ruined the sugar run and brought out all the fruit trees into blossom , only to be slaughtered by the hard freeze of May and the frosts of early June . Added to the cold it has rained incessantly so that in the flat country ? much of it the most fertile part of the Middle West ? it has been impossible to plow . Thousands of acres of oats have never been planted and the land will probably be put into soybeans to add to the glut . Some corn land is still too wet to plow . In such seasons I am thankful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost and , time . Owing to these advantages and Bob 's good planning and organization we put in 90 acres of oats in March and have about 16o acres of corn planted and above ground . The wheat looks wonderful ? almost like the fields in the Oise where the wheat , on land that has been farmed for a thousand years , lies even and level with scarcely room for another head . The wheat we pastured last autumn is better than the unpastured wheat . In our experience pasturing wheat does it no harm and in a cold , late spring such as this , pasturing does good by holding back the heading-out . In the unpastured fields some of the heads are not quite filled out at the bottom , owing  | to the cold . One year we even turned sheep on to the wheat without harming it . There has been a long stream of visitors of all kinds ? farmers , industrialists , government officials , foreigners , and friends . None of the bedrooms has been empty since March . Yesterday Lotsie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who becomes a destructive monster through her addiction to spiritualistic seances . Ince who wants to produce the play with Arthur Hopkins arrived yesterday . Both Lotsie and Ince are Hungarians and last night after dark we played with them what can only be described as Transylvanian bridge ? very gay but erratic to put it mildly . Charlie and I worked till dark putting in canteloupe and watermelon . It has been too wet and cold up to now . It is lucky that we did , for today it is raining again the kind of rain we should have had in May ? warm , heavy showers . P. T. Raman and Himat Sinhji , two Indian friends , spent a week end with us . Raman is perhaps India 's most distinguished journalist and Himat Sinhji is a colonel in the Indian Army . He is the brother of the Maharajah of Jamnagar and in peacetime is largely responsible for the good administration of the state . Two more delightful and entertaining companions it would be hard to find . Roger and Helen Kyes and the Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of them to take a plow and tractor round one of the fields . Raman is no mechanic and Himat has never even driven a car , although he did not tell us until afterward . The tractor took them in hand and presently returned with each one , white-faced and terrified but safe . We devised a plan for Himat 's return home to his state . Instead of riding triumphantly on an elephant he would enter raised high in the air on the platform of the Ferguson apple picker . Both Raman and Himat were impressed by the immense usefulness of the Ferguson tractor in India . A Ferguson tractor and implements in any Indian village could change the whole life of India , socially , economically , and even politically . The visit gave birth to a plan which Ilimat is taking to General Auchinleck , Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army , in London next week . The Indian soldier ? so Himat says ? is one of the best elements for promoting advances in India . He has traveled and learned to read and write and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the universal language in India . ( The language problem with some  | twenty-seven languages , not dialects , is one of the countless complexities of India . ) They have learned about machinery and most of them make excellent mechanics . Nearly all of them are ryots , coming from farms and villages . Himat 's plan is to set up a number of farms scattered over India based upon the plan set up at Malabar ? cooperatives , financed by private capital as an investment . There is , as Himat says , almost unlimited capital available in India for such a purpose . The farms would be staffed by demobilized soldiers and their families and equipped with modern ' agricultural machinery . They would also have an- educational function as " pilot " farms like those of the T.V.A. which could be visited by other farmers . It is a good idea which could have a great effect upon a huge agricultural country like India . Most people do n't understand that 8o per cent and more of India 's population lives on farms and in villages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India without at the same time developing an agricultural program which will provide more food and better living standards and create purchasing power for the products of industry . Export markets for manufactured goods , especially those of heavy industry are certain to go on shrinking as such countries as Russia , India , and China grow more self-sufficient . That is one of the facts that stands very much in the way of the reestablishment of the United Kingdom as a great and rich " processing " nation . In New York , Colonel Robert Henriques and I talked at great length on this British question . He , like all Britishers , is alarmed about the future of the British Isles and like most Britishers he is not optimistic . Ile suggested a decentralization of the Empire and the Commonwealth of Nations in which there was a closer federalized relationship between the Dominions , Commonwealth and Colonies , and the mother country , with the Crown moving from one to another at periods of the year . I t is the best solution I have yet heard suggested for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good solution for trade reciprocation ? that Britishers acquire a taste for Rye and Bourbon whiskies and send Scotch in return for the many Americans who prefer it . He has learned to prefer American whiskies . I , myself , still prefer Scotch , so we should 1 ) c doing all right . UNTn 17 : Back again from selling War Bonds in Indiana and New England . I know of no tougher work ? beginning every morning at nine o'clock with a municipal breakfast , then schools and colleges till noon
