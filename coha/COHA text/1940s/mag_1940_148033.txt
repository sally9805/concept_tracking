To Henry Latham Doherty , off to a business career at twelve as an office boy for the Columbus ( Ohio ) Gas Co. , the world of the eighties was an oyster and he held the shucking knife . By the turn of the century he was a crack western public utility man , and by the time he moved into Manhattan at 35 to set up Henry L. Doherty &; Co. ( utilities investments ) he was a millionaire and had feathered his chin with a goatish beard to impress Wall Streeters . The beard failed to work , and Mr. Doherty had to borrow money in Europe until Wall Street got to know him better . <P> In the next 30-odd years Henry Doherty 's Cities Service Co. spread from public utilities into the oil business , became as variegated a holding company as the country had ever seen , with assets reckoned ( 1938 ) at $1,080,068,703 . Meanwhile Mr. Doherty was all over the place . He was director in 123 corporations , owned hotels in Florida ( Miami Beach 's Roney Plaza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , operated country clubs , staged golf tournaments to publicize his real estate , organized cooking schools to cash in on his slogan " Cook with Gas , " sponsored birth day balls for the President and poliomyelitis . <P> In his skyscraper apartment in New York City 's financial district , he slept in a bed powered with a motor to trundle him to the open air , organized a campaign to put down mosquitoes in Manhattan , pushed the fund-raising campaign that got floodlighting for the Statue of Liberty . At 58 he found time to marry 40-year-old Mrs. Percy Frank Eames , relict of an International Harvester official . He reputedly spent $250,000 on the Washington debut of his stepdaughter in the depth of Depression I. Sickly , he twice explained profitable sales of his Cities Service stock , once during a bear raid , and again to his employes , by intimating in Government investigations and in court that he was in fear of death , wanted his affairs in order . <P> For the past three years , as " Edward H. Eggleston " he lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under treatment by famed Dr. Chevalier Jackson for a throat obstruction . Cities Service 's affairs more &; more fell into the capable hands of its husky First Vice President William Alton Jones . Last week to canny , mercurial Henry Doherty , reputedly worth $200,000,000 in 1929 , still a multimillionaire , death came at 69 . Faithful W. A. Jones , at his bedside when the end came , was regarded as the one &; only choice for Henry Doherty 's job .
