Like a woman wistfully leafing through Harper 's Bazaar , American Airlines , Inc. leafed through planemakers ' blueprints . It saw more shiny new planes than it could afford . But it ordered them anyway-$96,000,000 worth , to be delivered before the end of 1948 . American 's total assets were then $46,000,000 . <P> The bill went to the investing public fortnight ago in the form of American 's new issues of $80,000,000 in 3% preferred stock ( at $102 a share ) and 3% bonds . All airlines anxiously watched the issue . They too need money to pay for planes they have ordered ( some $700,000,000 worth ) . Would the investing public pick up all the bills ? <P> By last week , the airlines had part of their answer : investors who had recently snapped up many a new issue took two weeks to buy American 's stock , and at week 's end , underwriters still held half the bond issue , were arranging to cut the price . One trouble was that ' the stock market last week had its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board Chairman C. R. Smith put most of the blame fdr the slow selling issue on the public 's lack of faith in the future of aviation . He angrily blamed that on pessimists in the aviation industry . Said he : " This whole job of raising capital has been made more difficult by some people in our business . . . . Airplane manufacturers , including companies from whom we are buying airplanes , have expressed the opinion that the airline industry . . . has ' overbought ' . ... It is unfortunate that some people in this business ... do not really believe in it . "
