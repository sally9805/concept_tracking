Election day was warm and sunny . Near polling booths in bars and cafes beer flowed as on a special holiday . High on the Zugspitze vacationers took time to vote , and from Baltic beaches bathers ambled inland to cast their ballots . " It does not really make much difference who wins , " said a German in Marburg , " as long as there is a big turnout . " <P> The turnout was hearteningly big . Nearly 80% of West Germany 's voters went to the polls . When all the ballots were counted , Konrad Adenauer 's Christian Democrats were ahead with 7,357,579 votes and 139 out of 402 seats in the Bundestag . Kurt Schumacher 's Socialists got 6,932,272 votes , 131 seats . The vote meant strong support for the Christian Democrats ' free-enterprising ideas , a sharp swing to the right . <P> A Kind Gentleman . In the homestretch , the campaign had been spotted with Zwischenflle ( incidents ) . A tear-gas bomb drove Communist Max Reimann from his rostrum ; bullets breezed past Socialists in the Ruhr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> But the major party leaders tempered their tone . Socialist Kurt Schumacher expressed " appreciation that the Allies , especially the Anglo-Saxons , have made serious efforts to help Germany . " Socialists , Christian Democrats and Free Democrats agreed that Allied troops and security agencies should stay to prevent Russian aggression , but asked that Allied controls over German affairs be abandoned . <P> Germans took their first major free election since 1933 with a mixed sense of duty and fatalism . In Fechenheim , near Frankfurt , a worn-looking war widow puzzled over her ballot . An election official told an American bystander : " Under Hitler , the choice was simpler-each ballot had a big Ja and small Nein . " A young man said : " The trouble is we do not really know what we are voting for . All the politicians talk about is what is wrong with the other parties and with the Allies . No one tells us how his party can end unemployment , how he can get us houses . " The Germans were quick to pick up electioneering tricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored balloons proclaiming , " Vote for the Socialist Party . " Explained one little girl : " Some kind gentleman came up and gave them to us . " <P> A Need for Luck . The group that gained most was the Free Democratic Party , economically to the right of the Christian Democrats and called the " Bankers ' Party " by the Socialists ; the Free Democrats got 52 seats , trebling their best showing in earlier local contests . The extreme right-wing Deutsche Partei and the hotheaded Bavarian separatist Bayernpartei polled 17 seats each ; local and splinter groups , mostly right-wing , gained 32 seats between them . The Communists were soundly beaten ( 6% of the total vote , 15 seats ) . <P> Konrad Adenauer would be the new German Republic 's first Chancellor . He will probably form a government next month in coalition with the Free Democrats ; whether the Socialists would enter the coalition remained doubtful . As he viewed his victory Adenauer might feel some discomfort in the fact that just 30 years ago Germany launched another hopeful democratic experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased by the election 's outcome , wished Adenauer luck ; he would need it .
