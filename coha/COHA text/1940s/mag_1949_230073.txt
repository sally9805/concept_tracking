<P> On Okinawa , where more than four years ago U.S. arms won a famous and a costly victory ( 80,000 dead &; wounded ) , General Douglas MacArthur 's Pacific command has carried on a postwar occupation without much notice from the outside world . TIME Correspondent Frank Gibney toured the all-but-forgotten island , cabled : <P> <P> The rice and sweet potato fields of Okinawa creep over the slate volcanic soil , covering the shell holes and the bloodstained caves where two great armies fought for eleven weeks . Weeds cover the charred foundations of what once were neat stone houses . Near by rise clusters of lean-tos made of cloth , battered boards and castoff American corrugated iron . <P> For the past four years , poor , typhoon-swept Okinawa has dangled at what bitter Army men call " the logistical end of the line , " and some of its commanders have been lax and inefficient . More than 15,000 U.S. troops , whose morale and discipline have probably been worse than that of any U.S. force in the world , have policed 600,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( dubbed " Gloria " by meteorologists ) swept the island last summer and caused widespread damage , the Army finally investigated the situation . The island 's command was shaken up . Major General William W. Eagles , commander of ground forces , was replaced by breezy Major General Josef R. Sheetz , a convivial hustler who had done an able military government job in Korea . Air Force troops on Okinawa are commanded by grey , quiet-spoken Major General Alvin C. ( " Ack-Ack " ) Kincaid , whose slightly absent-minded philosopher 's air belies his hardheaded attention to discipline and morale . Since the change of command , Okinawa 's scandalous decline has been arrested . But Sheetz and Kincaid still have a tough situation on their hands . <P> Plight of the Occupation . Most American occupation families live in run-down Quonset communities that look like hobo camps . A few officers are quartered in small concrete houses ( built with materials brought in from the U.S. , at a cost of $40,000 apiece ) . The rest of Okinawa 's garrison live in hovels . Complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while of nailing the same piece of tin onto your house , watching it blow off in the typhoon , and then nailing it back . " It will take an estimated three years of building , and at least $75 million , before the Okinawa garrison will have adequate housing . ( Congress has so far appropriated $58 million . ) <P> Sheetz and Kincaid are faced with other morale hazards . Recreational facilities consisted of a few broken-down movie shacks and football fields . Okinawa had become a dumping ground for Army misfits and rejects from more comfortable posts . In the six months ending last September , U.S. soldiers committed an appalling number of crimes-29 murders , 18 rape cases , 16 robberies , 33 assaults . <P> Sheetz promptly set up classes to improve conduct . " You are ambassadors without portfolio of the U.S. Government , " he sternly told officers &men.;
