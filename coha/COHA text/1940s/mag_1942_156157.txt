Even the Secretary of Agriculture was last week ready to cry " enough " on wheat . <P> Plain and simple fact is that the whole 1942 wheat crop is as useless as any boondoggle . It is already costing the U.S. Government some $80,000,000 in benefit payments , may soon take $800,000,000 more for price-propping crop loans . But the country could have gotten along all right if not one bushel had been raised . <P> Last year 's whopping 945,000,000-bu. crop came atop a 385,000,000-bu. surplus . Half of this titanic 1,330,000,000-bu. total is still in storage even as this year 's wheat hits the market . Besides this , Canada has a 400,000,000-bu. surplus , Argentina has half as much again waiting hopelessly for ships . To top everything , U.S. farmers this year will raise a bumper 868,000,000 bu. ( weather permitting ) . Result : Western Hemisphere wheat supplies , already huge , will be utterly fantastic . <P> Months ago the Agriculture Department warned wheat farmers to build storage facilities if they did not want some 400,000,000 bu. of this year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some wheat farmers are already shifting family furniture and livestock , are stuffing wheat into spare rooms , pigsties and woodsheds . More prosperous growers rented empty stores . Meanwhile overworked Western railroads are planning a complete embargo on wheat shipments unless a farmer can prove he has arranged for storage space at the terminal . Harvesting this year 's wheat will take thousands of workers whose labor is needed in other fields . Besides , much of the wheat acreage would have been far better used for crops like soybeans , flaxseed , alfalfa . <P> The U.S. knew all this would happen , did practically nothing about it . Reason : the farm bloc . No matter how nonsensical the bloc 's demands , few Congressmen have the courage to vote it down-even in wartime . <P> But last week Secretary Wickard showed his courage , said he wished wheat acreage for next year could be slashed to 21,000,000 acres v. the present 55,000,000-acre legal minimum . Such a cut would require a Congressional O.K. , something most Washington dopesters class with a trip to the moon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay for another bumper wheat crop it does not need and can not store . Meanwhile , Leon Henderson 's assurance that wheat rationing is not immediately likely remains the year 's greatest understatement . <P> Only possible out : after the war , Europe may be close to starvation and the U.S. may be able to give its wheat surplus away . Then it can start piling up a subsidized surplus all over again .
