FISHING Plumber 's Helper <P> For over 300 years , Maine 's professional clammers have assumed that the only way to dig for clams was with a short rake and a strong back . Last week , they heard differently . <P> Stephen L. Higgins &; wife of Sanford plopped calmly out on a Maine tidal flat , began blitzing the bivalves with a common rubber suction plunger ( the kind used on a stuffed-up toilet ) . cIn the time it takes an uninitiated digger to gather several dozen clams , the Higgins had two bushels of them ( current price : $4 a bushel ) . <P> Said Digger Higgins : " It 's very simple , really . You just push down on this plumber 's helper , and up come the clams , all clean . " <P> Said a veteran , $12-a-day clammer : ' Well , I 'll be damned ! "
