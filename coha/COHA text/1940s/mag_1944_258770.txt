With the occupation of Morotai and the strategic end of the New Guinea campaign , the U.S. presumably has two more major jungle campaigns before Japan is beaten : the Philippines and the cleanup in Burma . But after two and a half years of jungle fighting , U.S. jungle equipment is still far from perfect . <P> Clothing . " Zoot " suits - the green-and-brown camouflaged apparitions worn early in the war - have been discarded by the Army ( marines still wear them ) . Nowadays soldiers wear a two-piece jungle uniform made of green herringbone twill . Because medics insist , it is thick enough to keep out mosquitoes and leeches ; because chemical-warfare officers insist , it is gasproofed . Result : a hot , heavy uniform which makes men sweat like stokers , fails to dry out overnight , often fails to give its alleged protection because men simply can not abide being smothered while fighting for their lives . <P> Quartermasters are now testing 1,000 new lighter-weight poplin uniforms in Burma . <P> Shoes . Green canvas leggings , usually prescribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the march throw them away , tuck their pants legs into their socks . The canvas jungle boot , which may also be worn , does not chafe but its rubber sole provides no arch support on long marches . The eventual solution may be a boot-shoe with nylon uppers and cleated rubber sole-if a way can be found to make the cleats stay on . <P> Rations . Jungle-fighting Japs can carry a 15-day supply of rice , which they mix with fish , bamboo shoots , water ferns , etc. , but U.S. soldiers must tote monotonous K rations-and a 15-day supply would weigh 38 pounds . Hence rations often have to be dropped in the jungle from planes , with the consequent danger that the enemy may spot the locations and gauge the strength of U.S. columns . <P> The Quartermaster Department is planning improved packaged rations . Maybe rice will also be provided , now that rice has been weevilproofed ( TIME , Aug. 28 ) . <P> That the problem of jungle equipment is still far from solved is nobody 's fault in particular . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best clothing was no clothing ; the best shoes , no shoes ; the best rations , whatever grows in the jungles . But the white man , with his civilized stomach , his vulnerability to ringworm , malaria and leeches , is far from being acclimated.
