The Solons of the National Amateur Athletic Union solemnly decided last week that Claude ( " Buddy " ) Young , famed University of llinois sprinter , could not call himself the 1944 A.A.U. 100-meter champion-even though he had won the race in a handy 10.5 seconds . Reason : Young and the five other Negroes in the 100-meter final were all disqualified for jumping the gun twice in the course of five false starts . The race was finally run as an exhibition just to please the crowd . <P> University of Pennsylvania 's Track Coach Lawson Robertson took swift advantage of this news . Summoning reporters and photographers , he demonstrated a Danish gadget guaranteed to be proof against both nervous sprinters and unskillful starting officials . In front of each runner 's marks lie two metal plates connected by wire to the starting gun . Unless every runner has his fingers on his plates the gun can not be fired .
