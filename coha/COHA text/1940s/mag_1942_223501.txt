Two of the most important Men Around the President are Harold Smith and Wayne Coy . The two men , little known to the U.S. because newsmen respect their " passion for anonymity , " serve the President directly as general managers . <P> They came into the news last week only indirectly , when , joined in the Bureau of the Budget , they began working as a team . The new team of trouble shooters already had the feel of working in harness . They were not high-strung race horses , as many another brain-truster has been . But in wartime Washington , with tough stumps to be yanked up and hard rows of work to be done , they were doing heavy duty . <P> Harold Smith , the Budget Director , conferring oftener with President Roosevelt than any other man save Harry Hopkins , had turned into a kind of left-hand man to complement Hopkins on the right . Long before the Army shake-ups in March , Smith 's able , quiet staff workers had run fish-cold eyes over the War Department , seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockefeller 's Inter-American Committee feuded , Harold Smith wooed them back to harmony . Before Presidential Adviser Samuel Rosenman reorganized war production , and cleaned up the defense-housing mess , he conferred chiefly with Smith . The executive orders with which President Roosevelt made and unmade war agencies , delegated power and took it away , were drawn up in Smith 's office . And Harold Smith has the final say on Government bureau requests for funds . <P> Wayne Coy , now Smith 's assistant , had served for a year as liaison man for the mysterious , jack-of-all-trades Office of Emergency Management . He was the man who untangled Lend-Lease to Russia when the knots were tight , who helped steer the property-requisitioning bill through Congress , helped bring C.I.O. and A.F. of L. together when John L. Lewis ' " peace offer " threatened civil war in labor . <P> Coy had also been-on his own hook and at risk of his job-the No. 1 drumbeater for the all-out war expansionists in their fight with OPM slowpokes . In the days when OPM 's Bill Knudsen assured President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tart Senator Harry F. Byrd shouted that it was 100% bad , Coy knew that Byrd was closer to the truth-and said so all the way to the top . For this he went deep into the doghouse for a while , but he finally won . OPM gave way to WPB ; the expansionists took over . <P> The Team . Working together now , Smith &; Coy have enough odd jobs to keep them busy from 9 a.m. to midnight , six or seven days a week . Their offices are prissy chambers on the second floor of the old State Department rookery ; each has high ceilings , gold-velvet draperies withering around the windows , a fireplace of sickly chocolate marble , festoons of exposed pipe and wiring . Among this lavender &; old lace sit the two streamlined gogetters . <P> Into the basket on Smith 's desk , on a typical day , may pop any number of neat typewritten notes signed F. D. R.-each meaning a new chore . For in wartime Washington , with its myriads of new officials , its changing pattern of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coy are the doers on whom the President relies .
