LATIN AMERICA <P> THE HEMISPHERE <P> As a part of its make-friends-with-Peron policy , the U.S. Army rolled out the red carpet last week for Argentina 's No. i military man , War Minister Jose Humberto Sosa Molina . Bulky ( 225 Ibs. ) , beribboned Sosa Molina loved it . In four days of Washington wining and dining he got on the outside of everything from filet mignon ( at a dinner given by Army Secretary Kenneth Royall ) to Army 5-in-1 rations ( at the Quartermaster General 's experimental kitchen ) . Brisk , soldierly and correct , he went out of his way to make friends , one day waddled into the White House to present President Truman with a gift from boss Peron-a small equestrian statue of Liberator Jose de San Martin . Along with the present went a little sales talk-a copy of Social Doctrine of President Peron inscribed by Juan Domingo to Harry Truman " with great affection . " <P> Between protocol and gastronomy , Sosa Molina got down to the business which brought him to the U.S. : military materiel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons catalogue , with a total value of about half a billion dollars . Army officials explained to him that U.S. munitions factories , unlike those in Argentina , are free to make private contracts with foreign customers ( although the U.S. Government has to grant export licenses ) , that if Argentina had the money , it could buy arms wherever it could find them . The Army itself could do nothing for him until Congress passes the long pigeonholed Inter-American Military Cooperation bill to authorize the U.S. to sell weapons to Latin America at bargain prices . <P> With his country eyeing the bare bottom of its dollar barrel , Sosa Molina was in no position to order U.S.-made arms . But he would not go home emptyhanded . With the Army Department 's O.K. , he would probably get permission to manufacture U.S.-model weapons in Argentina . <P> This prospect brought no joy to Brazilian diplomats , whose nation has long been the fair-haired hemispheric boy of U.S. military planning . The U.S. had no intention of abandoning so old and strategically located a friend as Brazil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securing the U.S. 's southern flank , figured that Argentina is the most powerful nation in Latin America , and that Washington would do well to be on the good side of its army leaders .
