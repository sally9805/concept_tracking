With ever-increasing aplomb , Tibby took her hurdles one by one , and they came to the mathematics , and played the number game out of Wingate , which they could all do on their heads and which never failed to amuse them anyway ; and they listened soberly to her conscientious explanation of the phenomenon  --  " If to the double of any number , a second number be added , the half of the sum must necessarily consist of the said first number and half the second , and therefore , if from the said half sum the first number be subtracted  --  " and so forth . By now the whole table was agrin , and Julian saw that he had won . Or rather , Tibby had won . Each and every one of them would have taken her into the bosom of his family and held her there with the most lavish affection , if such a thing had been possible . It was only for their own delectation that they pursued his examination paper to its end , watching with covert glances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereon reduced seven shillings sixpence to the decimal of a pound sterling , and divided a hundred and ninety-seven by five and a half , explainingthat to do so you must double both your dividend and your divisor . They did n't want to miss anything now . But they came at last , with regret , to the bottom of the page , and Julian said " Well , gentleman , that concludes the test I had prepared . There remainsthe matter of religious instruction , in which I have had no hand . But if you , sir  --  " He bowed to the divinity professor , a silent , pleasantfacedman with humorous gray eyes . "  --  if you care to put your own questions  --  ? " " Thank you , " said the Church , and smiled benignly on Tibby , who returned the smile with something almost like confidence . " I have been thinking that at this point I should like to hear certain verses of the Fifty-seventh Psalm . Do you happen to know that one , my child ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ? " " Be merciful unto me , 0 God , be merciful unto me  --  ' " " Quite . I see that you do know it . The fourth verse , if you please . " " My soul  --  ' " Tibby began , and hesitated , and her eyes grew round . " That 's right , " he smiled . " Go on . " " My soul is among lions , ' " Tibby went on , and sent an uneasy glance at Julian , and thereafter kept her eyes fixed on the clergyman 's face . PIOI " And I lie even among them that are set on fire , even the sons of men , whose teeth are spears and arrows , and their tongue a sharp sword . ' " George Mason was heard to chuckle . The lid of Mr. Wythe 's snuffboxclicked . " And the sixth ? " prompted the divine , and by his very gravity beneathtwinkling eyes struck an answering spark in the wide green-gray gaze which met his . " They have prepared a net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My soul is bowed down ; they have digged a pit before me , into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves : " " Thank you , " said the clergyman , and glanced in gentle triumph round the shouting table . " Gentlemen , I am satisfied . " Governor Dunmore had sent his family home to England at the end of June , and when autumn came he was established at a naval base at Portsmouth in Virginia , pillaging and burning and harrying along the coast with a flotilla of small boats . His force of marines and sailors was augmented by a rabble of renegade slaves and servants and a few fanatical Tories . The King could hardly have found a man better fitted to ruin his cause in the colonies . Therefore when business took St. John to Charleston again , Aunt Anabel insisted that she was nervous without a man in the house , and that Julian must stay in Francis Street to protect them , with Dunmore behaving the way he was . St. John laughed at her sympathetically , but made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night . Many families were moving out of the coastal towns of Norfolk and Hampton and even Williamsburg , for what they considered greater safety in their up-river houses . But Mr. Greensleeves declared he was tired of false alarms and brought his family back to the capital for the winter , alleging that he would not allow his children to grow up uneducatedheathens just because Dunmore was playing the fool . He had been unable to find a satisfactory tutor for the younger ones , and offeredpIO2 Julian the post at Farthingale . Julian had declined as tactfully as possible , urging the prior claims of his other work . The life of a resident tutor in the river mansions was likely to be an easy one , but he had no wish to meet Regina daily as a hireling in her father 's household , howevermuch pleasure the sight of her gave him . Her outspoken Loyalist tendencies , fostered by that year in London , would have made anyone but a woman , and a beautiful one , very unpopular , and they caused her father some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her all her wilful life , smiled at them as part of her English affectations which she would grow out of in time , along with riding side-saddle in a tailored mannish gown , and saying eyether in the German fashion . They formed an intimate bond between herself and Julian , which he found perilous and sometimes a little uncomfortable , for she rather threw it in St. John 's face that she and Julian thought alike , whereas he , as a Patriot , was quite beyond the pale . As the autumn went on , the constant mustering and drilling of colonial troops on the parade ground behind the College filled Williamsburg 's wide streets with rough characters , and the noise of their practice firing at a target became a trial to the once quiet town . Julian began to take his guardianship of St. John 's womenfolk more seriously , at least during St. John 's absences . They had given him the small family parlor at the back of the house down stairs for his own study , and shifted Aunt Anabel 's favorite armchairand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided was an improvement anyway , as the harpsichord was alreadythere . Aunt Anabel maintained that without a man in the house one would never know what to have for meals , and Dorothea remarked that without a man in the house there was no point in having meals . Julian said it was all very flattering to him , and did n't they know it was wicked to tell lies , and everyone was more than pleased with the arrangement . St. John on his return endeavored once more to make it permanent . " Mr. Wythe is all taken up with the Congress now and I 'm likely to be in and out of town all the time , " he said . " They need some one to fuss over , women get bored shut up together . What is your objection , man , to calling this house your home from now on ? " Julian hesitated. pI03 " How will your friends feel about it , " he inquired , " if you take a Tory to live under your very roof ? " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends are n't as rabid as all that . Besides , it is none of their business . " " I 'm not sure , " said Julian . " Feeling is rising everywhere . You might come to find me  --  embarrassing . " " You have a right to your own opinion ! I 'll wager half my friends do n't know how you feel anyway , so far as that goes . And while you are under my roof it 's not their place to ask . " Julian gave him a straight look . " You are doing it for my own protection , then , " he said quietly . " Nothing of the kind ! " St. John denied it with heat . " Damn it , man , I happen to like you , no matter what your politics are ! Aunt Anabel likes you , Dorothea likes you . You are one of us . If you leave now it will feel like a funeral in the house ! Besides , that room over the school is n't fit for a dog to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and too cold in the winter ! " " Your aunt went to a lot of trouble with it . " " Yes , and you almost died in it ! Place gives me the shudders . Do n't be a pigheaded ass , Julian ! " That seemed to settle it . Julian paid Tibby 's fee at the beginning of the autumn term with sensations which he supposed approached the paternal , and laid out more money on a new dress and hat and shoes . Her utter lack of a sense of inferiority or self-consciousness , all buried under her eagerness to learn , at once endeared her to Mrs. Hallam , and when Regina 's little sister Lucinda , obeying orders from Regina , took Tibby under her wing , the other girls accepted her without snobbery . She was far ahead of them in French , far behind in music , dancing , and the other stylish femalearts . But she was quick and observant and good-tempered , and it was soon the fashion to encourage Tibby rather than discountenance her . So for an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school to Mr. Day after all , in Mrs. Hallam 's French class , and felt just the least bit superior when some of the girls sighed romantically after the tall young schoolmaster , for Tibby knew him better than any of them.  | On an evening in December Aunt Anabel 's Jerusha tapped on the door of the back parlor and put her head in . " Mr. Day , suh ? That Tibby child is here , says can she see you about somethin ' important ? " " Certainly , let her come in . " Julian laid down his pen without reluctance . Tibby 's eyes were enormous and shining above her curtsy , and she obviously held to her courage with both hands . She had come , she explained , to ask him to do her a favor , please , if he was n't too busy . Julian leaned back in his chair and drew her to him with an arm around her waist and suggested that she tell him all about it . At Christmas time , said Tibby , at Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents came and there was a collation after the program . This year the dancing-master had arranged to bring his pupils from a boy 's school in Yorktown and they would all do a minuet with an orchestra to play for them . Lucinda Greensleeves was going to play a solo on the harpsichord , and another girl was going to sing , and some of the little ones were going to recite . Julian at once inquired what she herself was going to do , and Tibby wilted within the circle of his arm . They had asked her to be in the minuet , she confessed , but it meant a fancy dress which she had n't got , and so " And so we must buy a new dress , is that it ? " " N-no , sir . I told them I could n't do it . " " Oh , nonsense , Tibby , we can run to another dress for Christmas , I think . Maybe a silk one , though it is n't supposed to be patriotic to wear silk nowadays . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I came about . There is something I would rather have than the dress , if it is n't too much trouble .. " " Well , say what it is , monkey , or have I got to guess ? " " Please , sir  --  the other girls have all got families to sit in the gold chairs and look on . Would you come  --  just for a little while  --  as though you were my family ? " Julian was touched . " Well , but Tibby , surely your mother  --  " " No , mother ca n't come there . She is right not to come , do n't you see , Mrs. Greensleeves will be there , and Mrs. Randolph , and people like that.  |p105You  see , they might not understand . But you , sir  --  everyone would be pleased if you came , being a man , and all . And anyway , without you I would n't be there , and so  --  " " Well , if you think I wo n't be cast out for not being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said at once , and Tibby gazed at him in delight . It was as easy as that , and she had nearly died of fright to ask him . " Is n't it lucky I have ordered a new suit of clothes , " he was saying . " Otherwise I might disgrace you . " " Oh , sir  --  Oh , Mr. Day  --  I never thought you would really come  --  ! " " Well , why not ? " he demanded . " All I need is to be told about these things , I ca n't see through a board . Look here , how would you like to invite the rest of them ? Mr. Sprague 's Aunt Anabel does n't like Mrs. Greensleeves to get ahead of her , you know . Then you would have a real family , and we might all go down in the coach in style . Would you like that ? " Tibby was speechless . He rose . " Let 's go and ask them now , " he said , and led the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire . St. John sat near her , in a fragrant cloud of tobacco smoke , with his feet on the fender and read a book . Dorothea was at the harpsichord , playing softly to herself . " May we come in ? " Julian asked from the doorway , and St. John rose at once with his friendly grace and greeted Tibby as though she was a lady grown , to her boundless pleasure . Julian explained about the exercises , and how they were all invited as Tibby 's guests for the evening , and they all accepted enthusiastically  --  St. John inquired gravely if she would like him to wear powder , and she replied as gravely that she did n't think it was as formal as that but she would ask Mrs. Hallam if he liked . " Behave yourself , Sinjie . What about her clothes ? " said Aunt Anabel , who always thought of everything . " She will want a new dress for the night , Julian . " " Yes , I was coming to that , " he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was her gift , her Christmas gift to Tibby , and it would be made by her own dressmaker , and she would go in and see about it in the morning . " Then  --  perhaps I could be in the minuet after all ! " cried Tibby , and Aunt Anabel said Bless the child , of course she could , and listened to details with remarkable insight and sympathy , and then inquired minutely as to Tibby 's preferences in color and material , while Dorothea played Boccherini softly at the harpsichord . " That is the one they are going to dance to ! " cried Tibby , drawn to the music as if by a magnet . She stood at the end of the keyboard , watching Dorothea 's slim fingers . " You play it beautifully . I can only do scales so far ! " she sighed , and Dorothea laughed and ran scales lightly , comprehendingly , and slipped again into the minuet . " I know ! " she nodded . " I 've been through all that ! And then oneday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can play ! Like this . " " Sing something , Dolly , " commanded Aunt Anabel from the fire . " There is no danger tonight of disturbing Julian . " " But there never is ! " he said in surprise . " She never will sing when you are working in your room , " Aunt Anabel explained . " But I should work all the better ! " he assured them earnestly . So Dorothea played Low Down i ' the Broom , which was one of Miss Linley 's songs , and sang it almost as well as the divine Elizabeth herself . Julian , who thirsted for music always , came and leaned his elbows on the harpsichord , watching Tibby 's enchanted face . Dorothea played without notes , because her lovely nearsighted eyes could not read them as far away as the music rack , which was what gave her that trick of lifting her face like a flower in order to see better . She did it now , looking up at Julian , so that Aunt Anabel put out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nodded towards the group at the harpsichord , illumined by the candles in brackets at either end of the empty music rack . St. John screwed round in his chair and saw them from a slightly different angle . St. John saw his sister 's soft look fixed on Julian while she sang , saw that Julian watched Tibby , saw Tibby 's eyes go from rapt contemplation of Dorothea to meet Julian 's waiting gaze , saw the intimatesmile they exchanged . And a chill doubt ran down St. John 's spine . Dorothea and Julian , yes , he would never object to that , you could n't but love the man . She would be safe with Julian , safe and cherished and protected . And yet  --  how old was Tibby ? A child , of course . And yet  --  and yet . . . . " Play Drink to Me Only  --  , " St. John demanded when the musicpI07paused , and he took up the air in his own clear tenor . " Come on , Julian  --  Or leave a kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartily to the end , even Aunt Anabel , and then applaudedthemselves heartily too , and sang Blacked-eyed Susan , and Tibby had never had such a good time in her life . When at last she must tear herself away from the firelight and the music and the loving laughter that made a home like this one , Julian said it was very dark and he would walk along with her . They set off together towards the cabin by the Landing , their footsteps crisp in the frosty air , and Julian found her rather silent and inquired why . " I was thinking how lovely she is , " Tibby confessed with a sigh . " And how she sang . It must be wonderful to be like that . Do n't you think she is beautiful ? " " Yes , I suppose she is , " he said matter-of-factly , as though he had never given it much thought . " How old is she ? " " Well , let 's see , she must be all of eighteen by now . " Tibby trudged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the matter with you ? " he prodded at last . " Are you by any chance breaking the tenth commandment ? " " Yes , I am . I covet her family . " Julian forebore the perversity of pointing out that Tibby had a family of her own . He knew only too well what she meant , judging by what the household in Francis Street had come to stand for in his own lonely life . " And I covet her beauty , " Tibby went on fiercely beside him in the dark . " And the way she can play and sing , and the lovely clothes she wears , and  --  and the way she looks at you ! " " Now , whoa ! " said Julian firmly . " That will do . I ca n't have anything like that , do you hear ? " " Yes , sir . " " If you said that to anybody but me , it might be misunderstood , you can see that . " " Yes , sir . " " That is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagining something as harmless as that , and mentioning it to the wrong person . Besides , she is very nearsighted and ca n't see beyond the end of her poor little nose , so you ca n't really tell how she is looking at anything . About the last thing I expected from you is thoughtless envy of Miss Dorothea . " " I do n't envy her now . I feel sorry for her . " " Well , I do n't see that either , " he objected severely as they reached the sagging wooden gate and the path edged with oyster shells which ran down to the cabin . " How can you be sorry for her ? " " Because you are not in love with her , " said Tibby . " Good night , sir . Thank you for seeing me home . " She made him a curtsy and left him , surefooted in the darkness down the path . Mr. Greensleeves was away in Philadelphia and Mrs. Greensleeves fell ill of a pleurisy two days before the Christmas exercises . Lucinda wept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solo on the harpsichord , to say nothing of missing the collation  --  so Aunt Anabel offered to chaperone both Lucinda and Regina that night . " It will be a bit of a squash with all our dresses in the coach , " she remarked cheerfully . " The men will have to ride . " But St. John was detained in Richmond when the night came , and Julian was their sole escort . The coach was sent round early for Tibby , and she arrived in Francis Street to find her adopted family awaiting her in the drawing-room . The new dress was a success . Aunt Anabel 's dressmaker had fashioned it of pale green damask over a buff quilt , with short panniers looped high towards the back . The neck had a white lace fichu and there was deep lace at the elbows . Green damask shoes went with it , and little green bows for Tibby 's hair . She made them a curtsy on the threshold , and Aunt Anabel rustled forward to kiss her on both cheeks , and Dorothea made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there , and an affectionate spank behind . And then Julian advanced  --  looking very splendid in his new wine/colored broadcloth , with a formal black solitaire cravat above a froth of Mechlin , and a swinging triple-caped riding-cloak that nearly touched the floor and was lined with white silk  --  advanced to present her with a small painted fan which had carved ivory sticks and a tassel . Outside , he handed her into the coach with as much ceremony and care as he lavished on Aunt Anabel . All the way to the Greensleeves house , sitting with her back to the horses , she could watch him through the window where he rode beside the coach . He owned his own horse now  --  a dainty bay mare who lived in St. John 's stables and had cost more than a schoolmaster could afford . When they came to the Greensleeves house in England Street , Julian dismounted and went inside to fetch the two girls . Regina was coming down the broad staircase as he entered the hall , which was bright with candlelight . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was dressed high with a smooth curl on her neck . Her intricate gown was of creamy brocade draped over a high hoop . The bodice was cut square to front , with a ruching and a jewelled breast-knot . Filmy lace fell free from her elbows to the diamonds on her wrists , and diamonds lay around her white throat . He stood waiting at the bottom of the steps , his hat in his hand , the lining of the cloak framing his slim height to his heels , and it crossed Regina 's mind not for the first time that he was the most striking young man in Williamsburg , and that they went rather well together . Her blue eyes approved and encouraged him as she gave him her hand to kiss . " You look very solemn this evening , " she remarked when he raised his head from her fingers . " Shall we be everlastingly bored , do you think ? Lucinda is quite beside herself with excitement , and I sent her on ahead ten minutes ago with one of the maids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it was a great occasion for everybody concerned , and inquiredpolitely after her mother . Regina paused to look up at him in the hall , while the Negro butler laid a white velvet capuchin around her shoulders and opened the door . " Some time , " she said , " you will fail to say exactly the right thing to me , and then I shall know that you are human , after all . Provided , of course , that you are ! " Julian winced visibly. pII0 " I do n't see what I have done to deserve that , " he objected , but she picked up her hoop and swept past him through the door without replying . He wondered as he followed her to the coach if he should have stammeredout something banal about her beauty as she descended the stairs . He wondered if she guessed the rapturous agony the sight of her always produced in him and had perhaps determined that he should so far forget himself as to show it  --  or if she thought him the dull , inarticulateclod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them if ever just once he said the things he was not entitled to say and set his lips to hers as he had done in his dreams . The question then would be , how human was Regina ? They settled themselves on the frail gilt chairs in Mrs. Hallam 's drawing-room and the program began . Some of it was pretty embarrassing , and some of it , like the minuet , was delightful . Regina , on his left hand , smiled up at him ruefully as the children circled and dipped and pointed their toes with exquisite gravity . " It all makes me feel very matronly , " she complained . " How many little darlings have you ? " " I am just the bachelor uncle , " he smiled back , and caught himself thinking that Regina 's child might look very like Lucinda , even if its father 's hair was dark ... . On his right hand , Dorothea tilted her flower face towards his profilebecause she could not see as far as the dance floor , and allowed her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his and hers , this is what it would be like ... . Beyond Dorothea Aunt Anabel sat wishing that St. John could have been there  --  first because he would have enjoyed the children , and mostly because Regina was flirting outrageously with Julian and only St. John could put a stop to that . Everyone knew that Regina would marry St. John some day when she had had her fling . Everyone except perhaps Julian . . . . Later , when the company stood about in talkative groups with plates of scalloped oysters and cups of chocolate and punch , and Aunt Anabel had explained over and over again where St. John was , she found Tibby at her side and asked her with a smothered yawn if she was n't ready to go home now . Tibby said she was , and Aunt Anabel glanced at herp111sharply , for all the sparkle had left the child , and she stood quietly among her elders with an air of patient waiting . " Now , you have n't gone and eaten something that disagreed with you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ma'am . " " Have you got a headache , then ? " " No , ma'am . " " Well , what is it , child , have n't you had a good time ? " " Yes , thank you , " said Tibby politely . " It is getting late . We must go now , before you fall asleep on your feet . " Aunt Anabel looked about efficiently for her family . " There is Dorothea , with the Randolphs . Where are the others ? " Tibby was silent in an unhappy sort of way , and Aunt Anabel gave her another searching glance . " Tibby , do you know where the others are ? " " Miss Regina wanted to see where Mr. Day taught us French . So he is showing her the schoolroom . " " But good gracious me , there is no one in the schoolroom at this time of night ! " Aunt Anabel rustled towards the hall , across which lay the closed , deserted room where lessons were said each day . Tibby followed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulse to get Julian to herself for a few minutes . His impervious good manners , belying with every breath he drew the ardor of his honest eyes , challenged and exasperated her . He had never learned the London fashion of easy flirtation , the lingering kiss which fell not on the fingers but in the palm , the lightly uttered impudent word which brought hot blood to a woman 's cheeks , the ruthless pursuit of a chosen quarry which lent zest and sometimes a thrill of actual fear to the life of a reigning belle . He was altogether too respectful to suit Regina , now that she had been to Bath and Ranelagh , and had had a duel fought over her good name , which of course was thereby handsomely vindicated when the right man walked off the field unscathed . Nor had he St. John 's headlong masterful ways which made of her sudden assumed submission after a wordy quarrel an amusing game . Regina was spoilt , there was no denying . She meant to marry St. John when she got round to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow his conquest to look too easy . Meanwhile the world was full of charm- ing men , none of whom had the level , worshiping gaze and selfcontainedhumility of Julian Day . She had , in fact , never known anyone else quite like Julian Day , which in itself was dangerous . She had set herself wilfully to shake his composure or perish in the attempt . They found the schoolroom dark and empty , stripped of its chairs and musical instruments for the program in the drawing-room , its books and work-baskets in temporary disarray . It was chilly too , for the fire had been allowed to go out . The candelabra in Julian 's hand made a patch of light which wavered in the draught from the hall , and the door swung shut behind him with a click , under Regina 's hand . " What a dismal place ! " she said , and shivered . " It 's not quite itself tonight , as I warned you . " He stood holding the candles until it should be her pleasure to return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you come some time when we are in session and hear us recite ? Tibby 's French is really remarkable . " " You know , I think I am a little envious of Tibby . " " Of Tibby ? " He was lost . " She has found the way to your heart . " " Well , that 's  --  not difficult to do , is it ? " " Is n't it ? " She came to stand before him , looking up , all cream and crystal in the light from the candles he held . The brass candelabra was heavy , and he moved to set it on the desk , and she moved with him so that when his hands were free she still stood within his reach . The light shone upwardon her now , into her eyes , catching her round chin and the delicate lines of her parted lips . " You have very little mercy , Regina , " he said gravely . " When I have counted ten , we had better go back . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . His hands closed hard on her shoulders , but his height still kept his mouth from hers . " Are you going to marry St. John ? " he asked , very low . " Well , Julian , really  --  ! " " Because if you are , what do you want with me ? And if you are n't  --  " The words caught in his throat . " If I am not  --  ? " " I think it is time you told him so , " he said.  | " But I have never told him that I would , " she whispered , and just then the knob turned under Aunt Anabel 's hand . Julian stepped back quickly , picking up the candelabra as the door opened . They were not directly in front of it . It was possible to hope that he had moved in time . " Regina ? Come , my dear , it is time to go home , " said Aunt Anabel crisply , and stood on the threshold waiting until Regina had passed her through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned her back on Julian and shooed her charges towards the cloakroom . Of course , if he had been holding a five-branched candelabra the whole time ... . When the coach stopped again in England Street and Julian escorted Regina to her door and they waited for it to be opened to them " I 'm afraid we are in disgrace , " she said confidentially , raising her face to his . The cold moon rode high , and the shadows of the portico were black around them . She stood so near he could see her breathe , and he felt her hoop against his side . Her eyes were shining , her teeth showed white between her smiling lips . " I should not have asked to see the schoolroom , " she confessed . " It seemed a harmless enough request at the time , " he said briefly . " To anyone who knows you as well as I do ! " she laughed , her face upturned to his . The hoop pressed his side . " Some day , " he whispered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " By then I shall be too old to care , no doubt ! " The rattle of the chain inside the door startled them both , and they drew apart as the widening shaft of light from within fell between them . He bent formally over her hand . The door closed behind her . He was in the saddle again , an angry singing in his ears . She had no right to laugh at him because he had tried to remember St. John , among other things . Then it was Tibby 's turn to be escorted to her door , down the narrow path which led to the cabin . " Well , Tibby , we were all proud of you . I hope that next time you need an extra family you will let me know , " he said affectionately . " Thank you , sir . It was very kind of you all to come . " She sounded tired and deflated . He looked down at the straight little figure beside him , and with a rush of tenderness remembered Cinderella and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , you know , " he said gently . " For you it is just beginning . I shall see to that . " His cloak swept the path as he bent and kissed her cheek . " Good night , sweetheart . " He was gone , tall in the moonlight , his step so light it died away at once . Dorothea , who could not see beyond the end of her nose and was spared a great deal as a consequence , had enjoyed herself at the party and was still all achatter when they entered the hall in Francis Street . " Sinjie would have loved the tot who tried to say the Seven Ages of Man , " she chuckled . " She could n't have been more than four , could she , and she said snatchel , ' did you hear ? It was a silly thing to set a child to learn , anyway . Our Tibby is amazing , she carried the whole thing off to the manner born , while we 're quoting Shakespeare ! Julian , you are proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am , very . " " It must be such a satisfaction to you , after all you have done for her , to see her learn so fast . And I 'm proud of you , too , for being so kind . " " Well , thank you , but I only  --  " " You only took trouble with her , " she said warmly , and laid her hand on his sleeve as she passed him towards the stairs . " And I do think it is good of you , Julian , that 's all . Good night . " " Good night , Julian , " said Aunt Anabel , following her niece , and the look she gave him over her shoulder was not quite as fond as usual . " I 'm sure Tibby was a credit to us all . Will you see to the drawing-room fire , please , before you come up ? " The drawing-room was cold , but Julian stood quite a while with his elbows on the mantel-piece staring down into the embers . She had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep his head . Or was it possible , by some miracle , that she did n't intend to marry St. John anyway ? Even if she did n't , there was no miracle to change his own meager prospects into a suitable future for them both . He felt again the pressure of her hoop against his side . . . . But it was Tibby , sliding into innocent sleep under the eaves of the cabin by the Landing , who had his kiss.  |p115St  . John was still in Richmond when the news arrived there of the fight at Great Bridge near Norfolk , which drove Dunmore off to a British warship in the harbor and restored Virginia 's largest commercial center to the possession of the militia . The first Virginia blood was spilt at Great Bridge , but the British losses were said to be much heavier , and their commander was killed . Once again as at Lexington the colonists had won a small victory . And in view of passing events the grandiose colonial proclamations referring to the need of an army " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhuman soldiery " seemed to Julian just slightly ridiculous . The soldiery , after all , consisted of very manifest Englishmen , not sanguinary naked savages . St. John 's Richmond client had possessions in Norfolk on which he desired a reliable report , and so with a sigh St. John set off on a ride southward which would keep him from home over Christmas . It also brought him to Norfolk in time for the New Year 's Day bombardment , when Dunmore 's ships set fire to the town by shells from the harbor  --  a three days ' conflagration which left four-fifths of the city in ashes , and many of its wealthiest inhabitants without shelter in midwinter . Some people said it was a blessing in disguise , having at the same time smoked out a nest of Tories . There was even a report that the inhabitants had let it burn , to destroy a possible headquarters for future operations by Dunmore . But in any case , the talk of Independence increased materially thereafter in Virginia . St. John saved his horse but nothing else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be wept over by Aunt Anabel and Dorothea because he was safe after all , when they had somehow convinced themselvesthat he had been instantly killed by the first shot . St. John had now seen war at first hand , and it seemed to him both hideous and infuriating . He began to talk darkly of offering himself as a gentleman volunteer or a cadet , serving without pay on the chance of a commission  --  a prospect which left Dorothea white-faced and silent , and reduced Aunt Anabel again to tears.  | Tragic John Randolph had slipped away to England with his wife and daughters , as Mr. Wythe had prophesied , while his son Edmund remained behind to join Washington 's military family at Cambridge . From there he wrote St. John what Aunt Anabel called unsettling letters , since they encouraged St. John in his belief that he too had a call to enter the army . Washington was established in a convenient house near Harvard , Edmund wrote , and the militia ( now known as the troops of the United Provinces of North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College buildings and a la belle etoile , so that Cambridge had rather the look of a county fair . Washington was wearing an official blue and buff uniform now , with rich epaulets and sword-knot , a light blue ribbon , and a black cockade . Owing to a general lack of regulation clothing , his officers had all resorted to colored ribbons worn slantwise across the breast between the coat and waistcoat  --  pink for major- and brigadiergenerals , green for the aides , pink cockades for the field officers , yellow for captains , and so forth . Some of the men in the ranks , sick of shabbinessamounting to near nakedness , deserted to the British , were outfittedwith pretty red coats and white breeches , and deserted back again , which then caused some confusion more or less amiably borne . Washingtonwas known to favor the hunting-shirt costume he had worn in his youth in the Indian wars , as being both durable and inconspicuous , for the rank and file . A new flag had been raised at headquarters  --  a rattlesnake with thirteen rattles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding thirteen arrows . The hardest task of all before the American Commander-in-Chief , according to Edmund , seemed to be to collect sufficient powder and ball for his army . Most of the men possessed about nine cartridges apiece , whereas the British regulars carried sixty rounds each . An appeal was sent out to Patriots to donate every ounce of pewter and lead  --  even clock-weights and those from window-sashes were gratefully received , along with eavespouts and tableware . There was talk of issuing pikes in a desperate effort to cope with the deadly British bayonet . The British in Boston cannonaded the Cambridge camp almost every day , with trifling result . The balls sometimes passed clean through a house , filling it with plaster dust which choked its cursing occupants , and the grenades rolled harmlessly along the grass while the colonistsp117chased them and pulled out the fuses with derisive laughter . Riflemen and gentlemen volunteers were coming in from Virginia and Pennsylvaniavia Reading , where they were issued knapsacks , blankets , and ammunition . A man who brought along his own horse or gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churchbell rang and the Raleigh buzzed with excitement and everybody stood everybody else drinks , because Washington had taken Boston away from Howe . It sounded better that way than to say that Howe had evacuated Boston for Halifax by sea , taking his army with him and all the Loyalist population which could find water transport to accompany him . Washington had n't exactly won a battle , maybe , but it came to the same thing , did n't it ?  --  he had occupied Dorchester Heights and fired shells into Boston till it got too hot for Howe , had n't he ?  --  and of course while he had n't marched in until after Howe 's ships were slipping down the Bay , still he was in Boston , was n't he , and what more did you want , after all ? Then Edmund wrote of a rumor that the King was negotiating among the German princelings for mercenaries in an effort to eke out his overseasforces , and St. John said that if the King were sufficiently crazy to send a pack of paid Hanoverian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would personally go and shoot a few of them just for luck  --  at which Aunt Anabel cried out in despair that she wished Edmund Randolph would keep his stupid firebrand letters to himself . But Julian , sitting silent and unhappy in the family circle , had to acknowledge in his own troubled mind that the German troops were after all much more the King 's own people than the rebellious colonists , and that in the King 's possibly unbalanced point of view it was an entirely logical move ; which did not , of course , cancel out the logical reaction in America . He felt that if St. John went away to the army , his own position in the community deteriorated , no matter what Aunt Anabel or Regina Greensleeves might say , and in spite of the schoolmaster 's traditional exemption from politics . The Virginia Convention met at Williamsburg in May , led by George Mason and Patrick Henry  --  Jefferson was at the Congress in Philadelphia  --  andpassed a unanimous vote : " Resolved : that the delegates appointed to represent this colony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body to declare the United Colonies free andp118Independent states , absolved from all allegiance to , or dependence upon , the Crown or Parliament of Great Britain .... " That evening Williamsburg made carnival , all the bells were rung , guns were fired , and the British flag was hauled down from the cupola of the Capitol and the new rattlesnake flag of the United Provinces was run up in its place , to the acclaim of a delirious citizenry . Independence . Revolution . For Julian Day , the end of a world . He stood alone in the swirling crowd before the Capitol , with the bells loud in his ears , feeling sick . Dies irae  --  blow the trumpet in Zion  --  and the sun and the moon shall be darkened , and the stars withdraw their shining  --  this day 's work would bring war indeed  --  civil war , which is always more terrible than when whole nations go out to fight each other ... . A hand was laid on his shoulder and he turned blindly to find St. John at his side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " St. John cried , almost inaudible in the din , and his eyes were clear and fierce like an angry child 's . " By God , we ca n't look back now ! The other colonies are bound to fall into line ! It 's Independence , man ! We have damn ' well got to win now ! " Independence . Just two years ago at the Raleigh , the night he arrived in America , Julian had first heard that word , on Patrick Henry 's tongue . Two years . He had thought then of getting away before it happened . He had never wanted to stay and see it happen , any more than he would have wanted to witness a hanging . Then he was a stranger without ties and sympathies . Still less now , did he wish to be present at Virginia 's doom . But things were different now . Now he could not turn his back on the holocaust to come . He had made his decision last summer on the riverbank at Jamestown . These people , reckless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was here , his work was here  --  for presumablyeducation must be kept alive even during a war . " Does this mean you will join the army ? " he heard himself asking , and saw St. John 's face cloud over . " You know how women are , " he said . " Aunt Anabel has n't been well . I have said very little so far , but  --  I must talk them round , perhaps now they will be able to see  --  " There was a scuffle in the crowd and the twins appeared , dusty and panting , from among people 's legs.  | " Here he is ! " cried Kit , and they fell upon Julian and clung to his hands , looking up at him with eyes full of faith and confidence . " Oh , Mr. Day , is n't it exciting ! Does this mean we are a country like France or Spain ? Who will be King of America , sir ? " Their voices overlapped so that it was impossible to tell which was speaking . St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king in America , that is the whole idea ! " he said . " No king ? " They stared at him . " But then who will rule ? " " Ah , " said Julian , and caught St. John 's eyes . " That is the questionone of them ! " " Why , Congress , of course , " said St. John promptly . " Mr. Jefferson ? " Tibby 's eyes grew round , for Mr. Jefferson was just like anybody . One could almost say she knew Mr. Jefferson . " And Mr. Randolph , " said St. John hastily . " And Mr. Wythe . All the delegates from all the colonies together . " " But there can only be one king at a time ! " insisted Kit . " There is n't going to be any king ! " St. John reminded him with impatience . " For the Lord 's sake , Julian , have you never implanted in their infant minds any conception of constitutional government ? " " I am not allowed to teach modern history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern languages . You might take it up with the board ! " In June Virginia elected Patrick Henry as its first governor under the new regime , and he was at once invited to give up his military command and establish his residence in the Palace  --  which seemed to some a slight incongruity . At about the same time that the Declaration of Independence was passed by the Third Continental Congress at Philadelphia in July , the British generals Cornwallis and Clinton joined forces off the coast of Carolina and bore down by sea on Charleston , where Colonel Moultrie had thrown up a palmetto fort on Sullivan 's Island . Most incredibly , the British were driven off at Charleston with heavy losses , and were last seen headed northward  --  presumably for the comforting vicinity of Howe , who had left Halifax during the summer and established himself on Staten Island off New York harbor . It was a brilliant and decisive victory for the colonial forces at Charleston . The south had been preserved from the invader , and everyone 's spirits soared , and Williamsburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to have any more good news from the field for a long time . It was not pleasant hearing in August that Hessian troops had been landed on Staten Island and presumably would soon be used against Washington 's fortified positions at Brooklyn Heights and New York . St. John and his womenfolk had gone for their usual summer visit to Farthingale , which had been the major part of his Virginia inheritance . In settlement of his uncle 's debts he had sold it to the Greensleeves family , old friends of Aunt Anabel 's , who urged her to regard the place still as her home , and received her young nephew from England on the same terms . Julian sat down with a heavy heart to report to St. John by letter . This Hessian intrusion would be the last straw ; it seemed to Julian that now , unless a miracle happened , the colonists were done . With German man-power to draw on , the King was going to win his war . And that meant ruin for America , and disaster for the brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born with the right to mismanage his own affairs as he saw fit , and  --  quaint , endearing phrase  --  to pursue happiness . Only a people piteously young and strong under God could incorporate in the solemn declaration of its wrongs , its principles , and its intentions , its determination to be happy too . If the colonists were beaten now there would be anything but happiness for Jefferson , who had written out that amazing document which Wythe and the Lees and Nelson , the Adamses and Franklin and the rest , had all signed at Philadelphia ; that cool indictment of the sovereignwhich had shaken Julian more than anything which had occurred so far . If the King won , and it seemed as though he was bound to , the signers of the Declaration would all be sent to England for trial , and it was doubtful if any of them would ever see his native shore again . George III with his narrow , belligerent , pompous personal conceit would exact a heavy toll for what could only seem to him unsurpassed impudence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prerogative to hangpI2IWashington , and Greene , and Putnam  --  officers who had organized and drilled and led into battle a ragged , unseasoned army of Patriots who could only face the British regulars from behind trees and walls and inadequate earthworks . As for St. John  --  if he became one of those officers in the American army now , and it lost the war , the least that could happen to him was confiscation of his property , if he escaped capture and a brutal imprisonment . Julian sat a long time over a half-filled page . At last he folded and sealed it with a sigh , and took it down to the Gazette printing-office to find the post-rider for Richmond , along whose route Farthingale lay . Aunt Anabel , all smiles , brought the letter to St. John in the airy drawing-room which overlooked a lawn shaded by tulip trees and fragrantwith summer blossom above the river 's broad bosom . Regina sat by an open window with the breeze stirring the lace at her neck and elbows , a piece of embroidery in her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chin resting on his clasped hands on the back of it while he teased her for being too bone-lazy to set foot in the garden with him , and David Allen , the Loyalist Marylander who found such favor in Regina 's eyes , watched them moodily from the window-seat . At the other end of the long room , Dorothea 's fingers whispered on the harpsichordkeys . " Guess what I have brought you ! " cried Aunt Anabel , waving it at them , and they guessed instantly that it was a letter from Julian , for she loved the bits of gossip he always inserted for her special benefit . " It seems a very short one , " she remarked wistfully as she surrendered it to St. John 's outstretched hand . " You need n't all pretend to look the other way , " he said as he broke the seal . " I know I 'll have to read it to you ! " But he did n't read it to them . He read it swiftly to himself , while they watched him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and rose from his chair without looking at them , and turned away , down the room . " Sinjie , is it bad news ? " gasped Aunt Anabel , thinking of fire and fever and sudden death . He told them what it was , briefly , looking rather green around the mouth . " And that settles it , " he added , through his teeth . " From now on , this is my war ! "  | Regina , whose obstinate Tory bias might have been considerably lessened by this introduction of foreign mercenaries into what was after all a purely family quarrel , took fright at the disproportionate fury in his face and spoke sharply herself . " What do you mean , St. John ? What are you going to do ? " The harpsichord was silent now , for Dorothea knew only too well what he would do . Aunt Anabel gripped a chair-back and prayed one of her private , hysterical prayers to a benevolent personal God  --  Do n't let him  --  oh , dear God , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " I am going back to Williamsburg at once to find out how I can be of most use , " said St. John more calmly . Too calmly . " If Virginia has enough officers , or if there is going to be a delay about commissions , I shall go straight to Washington at New York and offer to ride express  --  copy dispatches  --  carry a musket  --  dig earthworks like a nigger  --  empty slops  --  what in hell does it matter what I do , so long as I am in it , and not sitting round on my backside talking about it ! " " There is no need to be vulgar , St. John , " said Regina coldly , for there was terror in her heart now lest he be killed , as well as anger at his lust for this unseemly war . " I feel vulgar ! " he snapped . " I have left it too long as it is . Too many other people are going to get a shot at those meddlesome German bastards before I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a glance at Dorothea . " I 'm sorry . I apologize for my language , " he said briefly , and David Allen rose with lazy grace from the window-seat , feeling that at last the Lord had delivered St. John Sprague into his hand . " I quite agree that we have left it too long , " he said in his insolent drawl . " Personally , I sha n't waste time waiting for the King 's commissionnow , I shall just get into one of the Loyalist regiments as soon as possible . " " Why , you damned , impertinent , interfering young blackguard , " said St. John softly , and they stood very still , looking into each other 's eyes across the room . " I consider that provocation , sir , " said David through quivering lips . " My friends will call upon you tomorrow to arrange a meeting . " " Boys , boys , that is quite enough of that ! " said Aunt Anabel with unexpected authority . " There is bloodshed enough in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight him , Sinjie , do you hear ? " " It will have to be now or not at all , " said St. John to David , as though she had not spoken , " because after today I sha n't have time for sport . " Neither man was armed . David made a formal bow . He was younger than St. John , with a longer reach , and he had been schooled in France , whereas St. John 's solid London training was enlivened by a personal flair for sword fighting which had given Julian plenty to think about in their friendly practice bouts in the garden in Francis Street . " My sword is in my room , " said David . " I will meet you on the lawn by the river in five minutes ' time . " " If you do , " said Regina calmly above her embroidery , " you need never come here again  --  either of you . " David paused on one foot on his way to the door , his fine manly impetus all gone awry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an insult ! " he pleaded . " But surely , " said St. John softly to Regina , and his smile showed his teeth but did not reach his strange , brilliant eyes , " you will allow your guests to amuse themselves in their own quiet way ? " " I would have you both behave like sensible people , " she told them , and threaded her needle with a steady hand . " And I really must refuse , St. John , to have my lawn turned into another battlefield . You will doubtless have ample opportunity to settle it elsewhere before the war is over . " David glanced uncertainly at St. John , who still wore that chilly smile . " If you are prepared to waive the privilege of this house for the privilege of being run through on the lawn , I am prepared to accommodate you within the next five minutes , " St. John told him . " Though I confess that the pleasure would be for me inadequate compensation . " " Perhaps as Regina says we shall find a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added picturesquely , " We shall meet again at Philippi ! " " Very well , then  --  until Philippi , " St. John agreed with a perfunctory bow , and turned to his hostess . " Regina , will you do me the favor to ask them to bring my horse around at once , I am leaving for Williams-burg. "  | " Do n't trouble to ring , dear , I 'll  --  tell them myself , and see to the saddle-bags . Come , David , " said Aunt Anabel firmly , and though she failed to catch Dorothea 's eyes she left the room with her hand hooked through David 's unresisting elbow . Dorothea still sat limply at the harpsichord , her fingers resting on the keys . The silence of the room drew taut around her , and neither of the other two would be the first to break it . " Are n't we to go home with you ? " she asked quietly . " No . It would be too much of a scramble . I will send back word as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Joshua . " " That might be too late , " she said , not looking at him , her voice under careful control . " Too late , I mean , for us to see you again before you start north . " He went to her with compassion , lifted her passive hands from the keyboard , and found them cold in his . " Child , I 'm sorry it had to come upon you like this . But you knew very well it was bound to come , did n't you . " She nodded speechlessly , unable to raise her brimming eyes above their clasped hands . " I shall be perfectly safe , you are not to think about that part of it at all , " he told her . " If I see a cannon ball coming I shall get behind Washington , nothing ever hits him , you know ! " With a sob she threw herself into his arms and clung convulsively round his neck . He held her tenderly , his cheek against her wet one . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know it makes wrinkles ! " he soothed her . " I have been on bad terms with myself for some time , you could see that . I would like to think better of myself , if possible , and that is why I 'm going north at last . " " You can doubtless think very highly of yourself , " said Regina , pullingviciously at a knot in her embroidery silk , " when you are at the end of a hangman 's rope ! " And she went on , while Dorothea stared at her in horror from St. John 's embrace  --  " That is what it will come to , you know . Because it is treason , as Washington himself may yet find out ! " " Regina , I have had about enough of your damned Tory nonsense ! " St. John left his sister and descended on the woman he loved , terrible in his righteous wrath . " If it were n't for your petticoats you would havep125been gaoled long ago . It 's not fair to your father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters to you at all ! " " Strange to relate , it does n't matter to me in the least , " she said , and her voice and her fingers shook above the embroidery . He mastered a flaming retort with a visible effort . " I shall be leaving in a few minutes , for I do n't know how long , " he said instead . " Let 's try , before I go , to look at this thing calmly . " " I prefer not to look at it at all . I prefer to dismiss it . " " Then by God you must dismiss me with it , once and for all ! " he cried , and cast an unhappy glance at Dorothea where she stood paralyzed in the middle of the floor . " I  --  I 'll go , " she whispered , and fled from the room . St. John resumed where he had left off , but with a change of tone . " You must make up your mind , my dear , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair and leaned above her from behind , till his cheek was near her hair , and his voice dropped low and fierce into her ear . " You must choose now , between me and the King , because you ca n't have us both any longer . " " Then I choose the King ! " she announced quickly , and her stitches were crooked and crazy in the pattern she could no longer see . His hands came down over her shoulders and captured her hands and his lips were against her neck where the smooth curl lay . " The King is a long way off , " he reminded her softly . " The King does n't hold you fast in his heart , as I do . You would n't care for the King , my girl , not when you want a lover . He has got a bit paunchy , for one thing , and he is much too heavy-handed , for another , and not , I should think , very imaginative when there is a chair in the way  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cheek , and she slipped into delicious laughter in his hold . " Oh , St. John , you are a fool  --  why must I love you so  --  ! " He caught the words on a kiss . Then , while he knelt beside her chair with his arms around her waist and hers across his shoulders " Let them fight their war , " she whispered . " It 's nothing to us  --  is it ! " " I 'm afraid it is , " he sighed , and turned his face gratefully into her bosom . She held him there.  | " St. John , " she whispered . " Do n't go . " He made a little sound of amusement and regret , without moving . " Do n't go , " she whispered . " Choose between me and Washington . " Again the same sound came from him , almost drowsily , against herneck . " I 'll give up the King , " she whispered , and kissed his ear . " I should damn ' well think you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his eyes with their candid curving lashes were very bright . " Has anyone ever even tried to tell you how beautiful you are ? " " And so you must give up Washington , " she persisted , and took his face between her white hands . " That 's only fair . " " Kiss me , " he commanded , and she obeyed him sweetly like a woman wed . " Never waste that on a king , " he murmured , and hid his face in her palms . " Say you will give up Washington , " she whispered , bending over him . " But I wo n't , " he said , into her hands , and felt her stiffen in the chair , and looked her in the face with a rueful smile . For a long moment their eyes held , and she could not but recognize the unswerving purpose in his . " You beast ! " she cried , but it was the protest of a child who has been duped with a sugar plum . " Because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still kneeling beside her chair , and every word as he spoke it was an impudent caress . " Oh , Delilah ! " he said . " You with the seven green withes that never were dried , afflict me some more ! " " I hate you ! " she cried , and believed it . " You love me , thank God . And when I come back , I shall prove it to you , all the rest of our lives . " " If you go today , " she said passionately , " I hope you never come back ! " His face whitened , and he rose abruptly from his knee and turned away from her . " I wish you had n't said that , " he said , and she rose too , to her full height only a couple of inches less than his . " Understand me , St. John , I will never marry a man who has borne arms against the King ! " " I thought we had finished with the King , " he remarked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so freely given , she flushed underp127his possessive gaze . " Besides , the Prince of Hesse-Cassell is not my king , and the scum and scrapings of his gutters and pigstyes are not my countrymen . Do n't you see , my dear , the quarrel is no longer between the colonies and the mother country ! It has become a contest between Magna Carta and a gang of unenlightened ruffians from the middle of Europe who never have known the meaning of liberty or acknowledged the rights of free men ! " " You sound exactly like Patrick Henry ! " she gibed . " You will meet British soldiers on any battlefield you come to , and you know it ! " " Yes , and with their hearts not in it , you may be sure ! " " And so you would shoot them down , because they are brave men doing their duty ! " He looked at her with affectionate despair . " They will have an equal chance of shooting me first , " he reminded her , and saw her lips tighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my dear . You are used to having your own way about everything . And if you ca n't catch your flies with honey you must lay about you till they are all dead on the floor . But that 's no good either this time , Regina . You ca n't come between a man and his conscience . " " If you leave this house today , " she said deliberately , " I never want to see you again as long as I live ! " He made a small , polite , ironical gesture of acceptance . " But mark my words , you were not designed for spinsterhood , my girl , " he said , and she gave an angry little laugh . " Well , really , St. John , one would think you were the only man in the world ! " " I am the only man for you , " he told her very quietly . " I am the only man who can bend that damned domineering spirit of yours and make you like it , Regina , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , may God have mercy on him because you never will ! " He walked away ' from her towards the door , moving with his splendid carriage by which she could always recognize him down the length of the Duke of Gloucester Street , long before she could see his face . He turned in the doorway , with the room between them , and his look was all tenderness again , as though he held her in his arms . " You will forgive me , " he said . " Some day . " Smiling , he kissed his fingertips to her , and was gone.  | When she heard his horse 's feet in the drive she ran to the library window to watch him ride away , and knew that her heart hung at his saddle-bow . I shall marry whomever I please , she told herself , dry-eyed , and began to cull over , in cold blood , the available Tories she knew . There was David Allen , handsome , sulky , and beside St. John very immature , who was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Julian Day ... . Because Mr. Wythe had been away in Philadelphia signing the Declaration , St. John found a great deal of unfinished business awaiting him when he returned to Williamsburg . Before he could get clear of what even in his desperation he recognized as inescapable responsibilities , Washington had retreated from Brooklyn Heights and was preparing to abandon New York , which could not be held without command of the sea . The Patriots ' cause looked hopeless . After the arrival at Staten Island of Clinton and Cornwallis from their Charleston failure , Howe had something like twenty-five thousand men , equipped and disciplined . Washington 's tattered army was a scant eighteen thousand , and a large part of it was next to useless under fire . It seemed a form of suicide to pin one 's fortunes now to what might prove to be the Commander-in-Chief 's last stand , at the Harlem River , but in mid-September St. John was off to the north  --  grim and quiet in his new blue uniform with Virginia 's scarlet facings , a handsome sword at his side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black hands . Dorothea said he looked beautiful , which made him laugh , and Aunt Anabel tried to say that he made her feel very proud , and puckered into helpless tears against his buff waistcoat . Julian had moved back into the room above the school and would not be dislodged from it . Dreading the interview , but determined to behave as though there was no shadow across their friendship , St. John stopped at the schoolhouse on his way out of town . It was a Sundayp129morning , and Julian was at his desk writing up his journal . He beheld St. John 's uniform without a change of expression , and offered him a chair rather formally . St. John stood still in the doorway with a quizzicalsmile . Then he held out his right hand and said simply " I have come to say good-bye . Let 's get it over . " Julian 's clasp was quick and hard . For a moment they stood there without words , and Julian was the first to turn away . " I suppose you will never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " I do n't need to understand . You are right not to go if you have no wish to . And you are wanted here , you know . " " Am I ? " The question came listlessly , over his shoulder .

" " St. John , in heaven 's name , what becomes of them if you  --  if Washingtonloses this war ? " " He is n't going to lose it . " " I wish I could believe that . " " I wish you could . And you will  --  later on . " " It is n't just because I ca n't believe it that I  --  that I am not coming with you . I know it must look that way  --  as though I held back from a forlorn hope .

" I just know I 've got to do it  --  like giving your own brother a bloody nose for the good of his soul . This **31;8543;TOOLONG on the throne needs a kick in the seat of his breeches . The British army ca n't do it , that would be mutiny . So the American army will do it in spite of ' em . Somebody is going to get hurt , that is inevitable .

" " I 'll do the best I can for them , " Julian promised solemnly . " Thank you . And there is one thing more , " said St. John , and paused a moment . " Regina will make your life a hell on earth if you let her . I can master her . You ca n't . Never say I did n't warn you . Good-bye , Julian . " He sketched a salute lightly . His scabbard struck the door as he turned , his spurs clanked on the staircase , the street door banged . His horse went at once to the gallop . Julian waited till the hoof-beats died away and then sat down with his head in his hands . It was an altogether dismal autumn everywhere , and things looked more and more as though St. John had wilfully run his neck into the noose . All through October and November the post-riders who swung stiffly out of their saddles in front of the Raleigh or the Gazette office brought news which got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then lost Fort Washington and evacuated Fort Lee , and began to fall back across New Jersey  --  Newark , New Brunswick , Princeton , Trenton , all were abandoned one by one , until at last the dwindling army had scrambled across the Delaware into Pennsylvania , and people at Philadelphia began to hide their valuables and send their wives and children into the country . The saddle-galled express who said that Congress had fled to Baltimorewas nearly mobbed by men who swore he was a liar , men who knew in their sinking hearts that they might have done the same , as the shadow of the halter crept towards Carpenters ' Hall . Williamsburg Tories walked and talked less guardedly now . When Howe issued a proclamation offering protection to all citizens who took oath of allegiance to the Crown within sixty days , and the jersey population fell over itself to comply , the Patriots of Williamsburg cursed them roundly and then took sidelong glances at each other , wondering who among their number would have had the conviction to hold out in similar circumstances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with appropriate festivities at Christmas time in New York , as a reward for his triumphant campaign , the taprooms jeered and swore and jeeredp131again , and speculated coarsely as to what title that would confer on the obliging American woman now known among his officers as the Sultana . At last a letter came from St. John  --  written to Dorothea , with a requestthat she share its contents with Aunt Anabel and Julian . She read it aloud to them after supper in the candlelit drawing-room in Francis Street , hei gentle voice making fantasy of the disasters he had set down so matter-of-factly ... . " ... There is no denying we have been weeks on the run and our reputation is no longer all that it might be , " he wrote . " The army is melting away , companies at a time , partly because terms of service are up for the militia , partly by out-and-out desertion . We lack tents and blankets and even shoes for the ranks , and the men are sickeningfast and becoming contentious . You can not blame them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their predicament , and he preserves a sort of leonine calm , to say nothing of a titanic resolve  --  but I suspect that he feels as strongly as the rest of us that the game may be pretty nearly up . Nevertheless he goes on hoping , appealing , and I think praying for reinforcements . If only we can get recruits to fill the ranks and help us to last the winter out " Howe has garrisoned Trenton with his Hessian bastards  --  forgive me  --  under Generals Donop and Rahl , together with a handful of Scots under a so-and-so named Grant , who I hear has boasted that he can hold all Jersey against us with a corporal 's guard  --  and Howe has gone off to New York to get his damned knighthood . The German troops are pillaging in the customary European manner , taking whatever they see that they fancy , and most of them have n't got a word of English to argue in . If only  --  our conversationhere is conducted almost entirely in the subjunctive  --  if only we could scrape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ammunition each , and if only the enemy could be taken by surprise , and if they all fell over their own feet and lost all their bayonets in the snow , we might just possibly contrive to dislodge them from one or two Jersey towns and capture some of their stores for our own use . I suppose there must have been a time when my thoughts were not occupied almost exclusively with food , and when I would not have been willing to part with my hope of heaven in exchange for one of Jerusha 's chicken pies .... " Dorothea raised stricken eyes from the page at this point . " You do n't suppose he is really hungry ? " she entreated . " Of course he is hungry ! " cried Aunt Anabel impatiently . " He is starving , and cold , and discouraged , and beaten , and we sit here helpless , stuffed with food , and for the first time in my life I am glad my poor Colin is safe in his grave ! " " Oh , Auntie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt for her handkerchief . " It is three weeks since he wrote this letter . Julian , you do n't  --  do n't th-think anything will happen to him up there ? " Julian came out of a reverie to search hastily for any form of comfort to offer . " The fighting is over for this year , " he said . " We can be reasonably sure that he wo n't be under fire again before spring . Washington should be able to sit the winter out where he is  --  " " Sinjie does n't say a word about coming home for Christmas , " she lamented . " He could have had all he wanted to eat , and taken back some things , like hams , to the rest of them . " Christmas was to find St. John otherwise occupied . On a frosty day early in January of 1777 all the bells in Williamsburg began to ring , and the streets and taprooms were soon full of hysterical citizens who pounded each other between the shoulders and bought each other an endless succession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice-choked Delaware and attacked Trentonin a snowstorm , thus ruining the Hessians ' Christmas carouse . Rahl was killed in the street fighting , the British line was cut at Princeton , and the redcoats were indeed dislodged from all but a precarious foot . hold at New Brunswick and Amboy . The tables had been entirely turned , in an audacious postscript to a campaign which had already been written off , and Washington was a hero again . Julian drank the Commander-in-Chief 's health willingly enough more than once , deeply moved by the childish soaring of Patriot spirits at what he could only feel was a fleeting triumph . He was able to share their fierce local pride of a neighbor 's courage and daring , butp133he could not muster any sort of conviction that there was any permanent improvement in their prospects . It was March before anxiety for St. John was relieved by a letter from him to Julian , delayed in transit , full of an unselfconscious satisfaction that he had been in the thick of the action at Trenton and had come off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides the human specimens and the guns and drums and colors we took as trophies in the action , " he wrote , " we brought back blankets , ammunition , and other supplies less decorative but decidedly more valuable . If we had only had a few fresh troops we could have captured all their stores at Brunswick as well , and indulgedin square meals for days on end ! " Congress has returned somewhat sheepishly to Philadelphia , and Howe has withdrawn himself again to the fleshpots of New York  --  no doubt digesting with difficulty the fact that he has lost most of Jersey to a general he thought he had beaten . We are now ensconcedat Morristown to sit the winter out more comfortably than we ever hoped , and recruiting is brisking up . If the British did not lack horses for their artillery they would certainly have come down on us again before now . " Fortunately it is a mild winter so far , but there is smallpox in the ranks and we are inoculating the recruits as they come in . The medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as scarce as ever . One thing we realize here on the jersey mud rounds  --  the army which could achieve an adequate hospital corps adequately supplied with drugs and lint and attendants for the wounded and sick would have a most incalculable advantage in this war . In any war . But herbs and simples are not all we lack ! There is hardly a sound pair of breeches among us , and even the mighty , like General Wayne , go shabby and threadbare . . . . " Dorothea was proud that St. John had gone north when things looked blackest . Anyone could join the army since Trenton . But St. John had taken the long view , and Washington had justified it handsomely . After that letter from Morristown they were a long time without one , and what news arrived from other sources was disquieting . Howe left New York again in the early summer by sea , presumably to attack Philadelphia , but Washington wrote to Governor Henry to put the Virginia militia on the alert in case the British should swing southwards towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they believed was the Charleston style and swore they were ready for anything . June was an anxious month . British troops were being shifted from Jersey posts and there was marching and counter-marching , but nobody could find out what Howe was up to . Burgoyne was coming down with an army from Canada . The Continental troops evacuated Ticonderoga as they could not hope to stand against him . July was full of suspense . No one , not even Washington , seemed to know what was going to happen , or where . August came , and still Howe 's intentions were obscure . On a sultry afternoon in September , Dorothea appeared suddenly at the door of the empty schoolhouse . Julian was in his room upstairs , working on a pile of copybooks , when he heard her call to him , and went down . She was looking very lovely in sprigged muslin over a hoop , and a wide chip hat tied under her chin with blue ribbons , and she stood peeringuncertainly towards the stairs when she heard his footsteps there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ought to come , but we have had news  --  I could n't wait to tell you  --  Oh , Julian , Sinjie is coming home ! " She laughed , and her breath caught , and she reached for his hand , and he saw that she still held St. John 's folded letter against her heart . " There has been a battle somewhere called Brandywine , and he got a ball in his foot  --  he says it is nothing , really , but he ca n't ride or even walk for some time to come , and  --  Oh , Julian , he is coming home ! " Her soft brown eyes were shining with happy tears . " Of course it is dreadful that he has been wounded , but he says it will heal , and meanwhile we shall have him here to nurse --  I know I ought n't to be glad , but when I think of seeing him again , alive  --  ! " The tears spilled over . Smiling at her , saying small , futile , comforting things , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her down , and pulled up a chair to face her . " It is very foolish of me to cry ! " she struggled on , mopping at herself with a damp bit of cambric . " But I am so happy  --  I hope he is n't in pain , but at least he will have a good rest here and proper food again , andp135Dr . Graves can see to the wound  --  Oh , Julian , you will be glad to see him , just like old times ? " " Yes , my dear . I shall be very glad to see him . Who won the battle ? " " The battle ? " Joy died in her . " Washington is retreating towards Philadelphia . " " Again ? " he sighed . " That sounds bad , does n't it . " " There is a new broadside tacked up at the Gazette office , but I did n't stop . Sinjie says Philadelphia would be no good to the British if they got it  --  but it 's the capital so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes  --  they will try to take it ! " " Julian  --  " She laid her hand on his sleeve . " Julian , what about Regina ? " " I have n't seen her for days . Why ? " " Well , I thought  --  I thought she ought to know about Sinjie being wounded . " " Yes , I think she ought . " " It might make a difference in the way she feels . " " Very likely it will . " " Julian  --  will you be the one to tell her  --  please ? " " But , my dear girl , surely it would be better if you  --  " " No , no , do n't you see , you are his friend  --  and I am only his sister . Whatever I try to say , Regina brushes it aside because she says I do n't understand . But perhaps she would listen to you . " " What do you want me to say ? " " Just that he is coming home , wounded  --  and  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be kind again  --  she must ! And ask her not to tease him about David Allen  --  that Maryland boy  --  he is an ensign now , in a new Loyalist regiment under Simcoe  --  she will throw it in Sinjie 's face if you let her ! " " My dear , I ca n't rule Regina . Nobody can . " " Sinjie can . But you must make her see him . Then everything would come right again . Oh , Julian , please try  --  " " It is a little difficult for me too , " he said slowly , and she leaned forward to see his face , and then drew back at what she found there . " Julian , you are n't  --  you have n't  --  you would n't come between them ! " " God forbid , " he said devoutly , and added  --  " There is not muchchance of that , I assure you . "  | But Dorothea was on her feet , looking a little blinder than usual . " I must go , " she gasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry , Julian , I  --  did n't realize  --  " " There is nothing to realize , " he assured her patiently , following her towards the door . " My dear , you must believe that . It would be very embarrassing if you misunderstood . It 's only  --  " " I think I understand -- quite well , " she said breathlessly , and he caught her at the door . " I will talk to her if you wish , " he promised . " Dorothea , I will do my best to bring them together again . " " They belong together , " she whispered . " Oh , believe me , Julian , they do ! " And she was gone . Julian got his hat and set out very thoughtfully for England Street , wondering how he was to go about his mission . As he passed the apothecary'sshop , running feet overtook him and the twins flung themselves at him , one on either side . " Oh , Mr. Day , have you heard ? Congress has fled Philadelphia again ! They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march into Philadelphia this week ! Does that mean we have lost the war ? " He paused in the broad shady street , Kit holding his left arm , Tibby panting on his right , her hat hanging down her back by its ribbons . In the waiting eyes of both was the same shining confidence in his wisdom  --  whatever he said , would be . " We have n't lost the war until Washington surrenders , " he said . " But he 'll never do that ! " cried Kit . " There , Kit , I told you ! Washington will go on fighting ! Philadelphia is only a town ! " cried Tibby . " We 've still got Norfolk and Charleston and Yorktown ! " " There is an express just in from the north , sir , and everyone is down at the Raleigh . " Kit tugged at him . " Come and hear what they are saying ! " " I ca n't now , " he said , wishing he could use Kit 's invitation to postponewhat was ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street . Mr. Sprague has been wounded and is coming home to recover . " Kit and Tibby exchanged a knowing look . " Brandywine , " said Tibby . " Kit , you go back to the Raleigh and see what you can hear . I 'm going to walk a ways with Mr. Day . "  |p137Julian  shortened his step to hers . Tibby was n't growing much , but she had a new dignity since her modest success at Mrs. Hallam 's , and soon she would be allowed to earn a few shillings by helping with the younger children . He was very well pleased with what he had been able to do for Tibby , but he had not seen much of her lately . Her mother , always frail , had had a bout of fever , which made extra responsibility for the twins . " Will they be married now , do you think ? " Tibby inquired with her customary directness on the way to England Street . " I do n't know . It is possible . " " If I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went , " said Tibby , and Julian smiled at her slantwise and said " Would you ? " with some doubt . She nodded , and pulled up her hat to shade her face . " If the man I loved was going to war , " said Tibby , secretly thanking God that he was n't , " I would n't want him to go without  --  that is , I would want him to have  --  anything he wanted of me  --  while there was time . Suppose Mr. Sprague had got killed at Brandywine  --  then how would she feel ? " " Suppose he had lost his leg , " said Julian . " Then how would he feel ? " " It ought n't to matter to her  --  so long as she got him back . " " You are very wise today , Tibby . How would you like to come alongin and give Miss Regina some advice ? " Tibby glanced up in surprise , for the ironical tone was not one she was accustomed to from him . " Reckon I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was thinking if it was you . I mean , " she floundered , getting pink under the hatbrim , " I did n't mean to criticize Miss Regina  --  I only meant that if you love a man enough , you ca n't bear to have him be without anything you can give him  --  I should n't think . " There was a pause , punctuated by their measured footfalls . At last  --  " I 'm sorry , sir , " said Tibby humbly . " I 'll go back now . " Julian , who had scarcely heard her , came to himself with a start . " Tibby , I apologize . I 'm afraid I was n't listening . I was trying to think how to break it to her  --  wondering how she will take it . " " If she loves him she will be very ashamed of herself ! " cried Tibby. " 1 should go down on my knees to him , if I were in her place , and promise to do everything he wished from now on ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised the flushed and angry little face to his sympathetic gaze . " Why , Tibby , " he said , " are you jealous of Miss Regina ? " " Sometimes I hate her ! " she cried , and jerked her chin free and made him her curtsy and marched away from him , back along the way they had come . He stood staring after her , his hat still in his hand . Poor Tibby , he thought  --  she was only a child , of course , and it was perhaps inevitable that she should apparently have come to idolize St. John , who was always so charming to her . But St. John belonged to Regina , and it would never do to have Tibby breaking her heart for him as she grew older  --  Julian could never remember the twins ' exact age without countingit up ; they had never reached an awkward stage and were smallbonedand childish still . But Tibby falling in love  --  hopelessly  --  with St. John ! He wondered if he ought to mention this curious prospect to Aunt Anabel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her teens now .... He entered Regina 's drawing-room still bemused , and blurted out his news about Brandywine with less finesse even than he might have done . Regina was startled and unhappy , he could see that , but anything beyond the concern due to an old friend was quickly masked . Bunglingly he proceeded . " Dorothea thought perhaps in the circumstances  --  you would see him again , " he suggested . " Dorothea is a darling  --  but just a little dense , is n't she , to send you on this errand ? " " She is only thinking of St. John , " he said uncomprehendingly . " It might be better for Dorothea if she thought of herself once in a while ! Still , I should be grateful to her , I suppose , for this unexpected pleasure . " The words , plus the smile which went with them , had a double meaning , and he stiffened defensively . " Must you avoid me so ? " she asked , and made a small imperious gesture towards the sofa beside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , " he said , and sat down at the far end , warily , and inquired in his punctilious fashion after the health of her parents , while their glances sparred and their smiles grewp139a little fixed , and the devil who lived in Regina 's proud , undisciplined spirit possessed her again . If St. John had written to tell her of his wound , and made a suitable plea for a sight of her to restore him to health , Regina would have condescended . But that would not have been St. John . He wrote to Dorothea , with probably never a word of her , Regina , in the letter , not even to send his love , and Dorothea sent Julian to plead for her brother , which was tactless , and just the stupid sort of thing a schoolgirl like Dorothea would do , and if she could not learn better she deserved to lose him . Not that he was hers to lose , so far , but it was plain enough she wanted him , thought Regina cruelly , her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with thin boyish wrists  --  hands very different from St. John 's sinewy brown ringers , but nothing womanish about them , nothing soft . He would be very gentle always , very kind , very easily hurt . He would never hit back with a laugh , like St. John , who seemed actually to enjoy being trodden on , and always gave as good as he got . There would be some satisfaction , when . St. John came home a hero , in telling him that one was going to marry somebody else ... . She had not noticed how long the silence was stretching , until at last Julian rose rather abruptly , towering over her , and said that he must go . " But I never see you any more , " she complained , and held out both her hands to him , rising as she yielded them to his clasp . " Presumably that makes my life a little easier , " he smiled , holding her hands . " I think you are very unkind ! " she cried , laughing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though  --  denying myself even the sight of you , while days I can never live again slip away empty . " Her fingers curled warm and close in his , for this was more the way she wanted him to talk . Backward lover though he might be , she knew by the quickening of her own heartbeat that these still waters ran deep . St. John 's wound was not so serious but that she could bear to have her triumph anyhow , and Julian with his reticent but always tacit worship of herself was mysterious and enthralling and unlike any man who had ever desired her before . One could make him happy without ever being bored oneself , she was thinking , and at the same time teach St. John that he was not the only man in the world . And the time was now , when Julian had for once made something more than a pretty speech . " Then why do you deny us both our simple pleasures ? " she murmured . " I have missed you , Julian . One has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss them . We are friends , are n't we ? " " Not exactly . " " You say very strange things today . What am Ito think ? " " You know quite well what to think . We ca n't be friends because you go to my head like wine . And the only thing for a man who can not carry his liquor to do is to shun the bowl . " " You are always full of moralities , are n't you , Julian ! " " Perhaps because I am a schoolmaster . " " Do you feel like a schoolmaster  --  always ? " Her hands laid his behind her waist , he felt the yield of her hoop against him , her face was upturned to his . For a moment , with a roar of blood in his ears , he hesitated , and then said quietly " You quarrelled with St. John , did n't you ? Are you using me as a stick to beat him with ? " It was so exactly the truth that she could not deny it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought she had won through his defensesat last . " St. John made his free choice between me and Washington , " she said , for it still rankled in her . " Let him abide by it . I warned him how it would be . " " You want me to help you teach him a lesson , is that it ? " " Oh , Julian  --  why do you make it sound so cold-blooded ? " " Because that is the way it seems to me . Because I think you still love him , in spite of yourself . " " But I do n't . That is finished . " " Just to make sure , " he said , " wo n't you see him ? " " No . Not even to please you . And I would like very much to please you , Julian . " A moment more he stood with his hands clasping her waist , while his gaze caressed her face and hair and throat . " Then  --  let me go , " he said with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which clung to his , and walked out of the room without a backward look . So she had nothing to tell St. John after all . St. John arrived home in a ramshackle dog-cart drawn by an emaciated horse which he drove himself  --  transportation was scarce in the north . His uniform was shabby and battle-stained , his wound was painful from lack of care , and the British were in Philadelphia  --  but St. John 's spirits were high , he was full of hilarious stories , and referred to his bulbously bandaged foot as the gout . He refused to stay in bed , and got about the house rather precariously on an improvised crutch he had brought with him , thwarting whenever possible the ambition of Joshua to carry him and the pleas of his womenfolk to lean on them . Dr. Graves called every day and managed before long to reduce the pain and the size of the bandage . All Williamsburg flocked to Francis Street to hear St. John 's stories , and he was the first to admit that some of them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over again , about the British sentry who caught an American militiaman near an outpost one night and called back to his captain : " I have taken a prisoner ! " The captain replied , " Well , bring him in ! " " But he will not come ! " bawled the sentry . " Then leave him and come back yourself ! " commanded the captain . And the sentry , plaintively : " But he will not let me go ! " St. John told it well , and it always produced a crow of laughter from Aunt Anabel , who never tired of it . Aunt Anabel even permitted him to sing , more than once , certain verses of a very rude song about General Howe , including the one which ran as follows : " Sir William , he , snug as a flea , Lay all this time a-snoring , Nor dreamt of harm as he lay warm In bed with Mrs. Loring. "  | St. John said little about how he had got his wound , beyond remarkingthat the first he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inclinedinstead to dwell on the coincidence that Lafayette had had a similar experience and had been carted off somewhere beyond Philadelphiato recuperate  --  which he , St. John , would not have cared for at all . According to St. John , the army surgeons were all too prone to amputate what could not be dealt with easily by the limited skill and resources at their disposal , and the best thing to do if you got hit in the arm or the leg was to keep out of hospital . Lafayette ? He loved to tell about the young French marquis recently added to Washington 's official family  --  and a very different proposition from most of his countrymen now swarming to America in search of military fame and easy pickings . Lafayette 's belief in the cause of freedomburned like Washington 's own , and he was already regarded almost as a son by the Commander-in-Chief . He was as tall as Washington  --  barely twenty years old , and very unassuming . When the French Governmenthad refused to permit the departure from France of so wealthy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole ship and worn a disguise to escape in , and he left a young wife and family behind , asking only to serve as a volunteer without pay in the American army . St. John , who had been present at the Marquis ' first meeting with Washington , said it was rather like that of Jeanne d'Arc and the Dauphin  --  in that Lafayette had selected and approached the Commander-in-Chief unerringly from amongst a group of officers surroundinghim at a banquet in Philadelphia . The drawing-room in Francis Street liked to hear about de Kalb too  --  the gigantic gallant German who had accompanied Lafayette from France and during the endless stormy voyage had labored patiently to teach him English . De Kalb had served so long with the French army he ranked as one of its officers , and he had been in America in 1768 as an agent of de Choiseul . St. John said the people who laughed at de Kalb were all wrong . True , he wore an odd Swiss hat , and his hair was caked with powder and had a ludicrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no less , had praised his generalship , and his experience in the field with de Broglie during the Seven Years ' War must tell . Besides , said St. John , he was the soul of kindness , and sensi/tive to the snubs and ridicule his appearance sometimes brought upon him . St. John had seen the new flag , recently authorized by Congress and first under battle fire at Brandywine  --  thirteen stripes alternately white and red , with thirteen white stars on a blue ground  --  and he pronounced it very handsome and distinctive . There was nothing like it in the world , and its beauty was a great improvement over what he called the snakeand-muscleemblem . The stars and stripes made a flag as charming as a woman 's gown , with which to clothe the new nation in its care . It was a feminine-looking flag , said St. John sentimentally , and the rough , homesick men who fought under it liked that . The color sergeants at once called it " she . " " Ai n't she the purtiest thing ever waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circle of upturned faces viewing it for the first time . " Ai n't she dainty and sweet ? No snakes on you , is there , my girl ! " And he patted the staff with a horny , affectionate hand . Howe , St. John reported , was such an infernal gentleman about it all , he even returned unopened one of Washington 's letters to Mrs. Washington , when a post-bag was captured . You could n't , St. John pointed out , work up a murderous rage against that sort of fellow  --  not even , it would seem from the man Loring 's behavior , when he appropriated your wife under your very nose ! Speaking of letters  --  and then would come the tale of the other Howe , the Admiral , who addressed an official communication to " George Washington , Esq . " only to have his messengerpolitely informed that there was no person in the American army with that address . A few days later the British adjutant-general himself arrived with another letter from the Admiral addressed to " George Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain to the Commander-in-Chiefin a personal interview that the etceteras meant everything required . Washington agreed with a pleasant smile that they might indeedmean almost anything , and added that as the letter appeared to be addressed to a planter in the state of Virginia , it would be forwarded to him at the close of the war , and until then would not be opened . The requisite " Excellency " and " General " were never wrung from Admiral Howe , but his brother had finally resigned himself to the formality , to facilitate the necessary correspondence regarding the exchange of pris  --  oners and so on.  |p144Meanwhile  , St. John 's new uniforms with a captain 's epaulet on the right shoulder arrived from the tailor and became him mightily . He never mentioned Regina and for days her name went unspoken . He asked after Tibby , though , and when she came to see him he devoted himself to her for an hour and was much impressed with the change in her . Tibby was turning thirteen , and bore herself accordingly . After nearly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His precious Dorothea was quieter than he liked , and seemed inclined to leave him alone with Julian , and avoided the subject they had always spoken of freely  --  Regina 's place in their future . Julian was quite himself , perhaps a little remote still , but with the exercise of tact they slipped again into the old easy ways . And Tibby ? St. John pondered Tibby , staring into the fire with his foot on a hassock and a pipe between his lips  --  her direct greenish gaze and straight small shoulders , her gentle speech and obstinate chin  --  she could not be discounted as a child much longer . Dorothea came in and laid a caressing hand on his shoulder and his went up to cover it . " Oh , Sinjie , darling , I tried to make her change her mind ! " she cried impulsively , for she supposed that he brooded over his wayward love . " I thought surely when she heard you had been wounded it would bring her to her senses ! " He smiled , and laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broad arm of the chair . " That was subtle of you ! " he said affectionately . " What did she say when you told her ? " " Well , I  --  I did n't tell her myself , I asked Julian to . You see  --  " She flushed before the amused quirk of his brows as he looked up at her . " I hope you do n't think it was interfering of me , " she apologized . " But you see , it had got so that she would n't pay any attention to me  --  because of my being your sister and naturally prejudiced  --  " " Poor Julian , " murmured St. John . " He could n't have enjoyed it much himself . " " Well , you see , I was stupid , I did n't realize till after I had asked him that he was in love with her . " The strong brown fingers that caressed hers were suddenly still  --  and something in their stillness turned Dorothea quite cold , and thenp145hot , and then cold again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taken by surprise  --  that she must have given something away . She sat paralyzed with her hand in his , waiting for the sky to fall on her . And St. John said nothing at all . It seemed to her that he had stopped breathing , under her hand , until at last she could bear it no longer , and slipped to her knees beside the chair , with her face hidden in her arms flung across his lap . " Oh , Sinjie , forgive me , I should n't have mentioned it , I did n't think what I said , I thought you knew , I  --  Sinjie , it 's just as bad for me as it is for you ! " she sobbed , all her defenses gone . She felt his hand on her hair  --  it slid down , warm and comforting , to close on the nape of her neck in a way he had to ease a headache . But still he did not speak , and she raised her face , wet with tears , to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she begged him . " Yes , child  --  what do you want me to say ? " His eyes were fixed away from her , on the fire . " Sinjie , do n't look like that ! I do n't think it has come to anything  --  yet . " " No . It wo n't come to anything , " he said quietly , his eyes on the fire . " You mean you can put a stop to it ? " she asked , hopeful in spite of herself , for St. John always made things come right somehow . He turned his head then , and smiled at her , looking deep into her t rustful eyes . Put a stop to Regina 's wilful whims , perhaps , he had done that before . But how to put a stop to his surging anger at her savage selfishness , her wicked , witless pride , which took no heed of anything but her necessity to make him sorry he had crossed her ? And how to master that other anger , quick and hot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have been too sensible to play moth to her flame ? True , he had warned Julian before he went north , but only as a precaution , a crossing of fingers against the highly improbable thing which seemed to have happened after all while his back was turned . As for this soft , beloved creature in his arms , he would have given a year of his life for the answer . But you can not challenge your best friend because he will not see your sister . " You  --  wo n't ever let him know ? " she pleaded . " It is a thing a man likes to find out for himself , " he told her . " He has to look , first ! Oh , if only this war would end , because with you here at home again she would never dare to lead him on ! " " Does she lead him on ? " His smile was a little rigid . " I do n't know . I do n't know what passes between them , or how often he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sinjie , it would be the wrong thing for him  --  even if I did n't love him so much myself , I should hate to see him marry Regina . She would only make him miserable , he does n't know how to take her , she would trample on him , and he would n't know what to do  --  " " I know , " he nodded , still with that odd smile . " Regina wants beating every now and then , and I am the man for that ! " " Oh , Sinjie , you c-could n't  --  ! " She paused , round-eyed , for a short , hard laugh escaped him . " She knows I could , " he said . " She knows I would . It 's the same thing ! " He reached for his pipe , and she opened the tobacco jar and held it for him , and then lighted a spill at the fire . " I will go so far as to wager with you , " he said between fragrant puffs as she held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not marry Julian . She would like to , just to spite me now . But it is very unlikely all the same , if I survive the war . " " If you  --  ! " She threw the spent spill into the grate and knelt beside him again , holding him with jealous , loving hands . " Must you go back , Sinjie ? " " Very soon . " " Have n't you done enough ? " " No one has done enough . And there is another thing , my dear  --  if it goes on , and it will , you will see Julian in a uniform like this one yet . " She looked up at him from the floor , between hope that he was right and fear that he was  --  right . " In which case , " St. John continued , voicing her half-formed conclusion , " he too will be cast into outer darkness while the war lasts ! " " I suppose he will take that very hard , " she reflected . " He always takes things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She does want beating , " he repeated , lingering wistfully on the idea . Dorothea showed a fleeting dimple . " I dare you , " she said . " I would have to break down the door to get at her , " he objected gravely . " It would make an awful mess , and a crowd would gather . Youp147know how crowds are . Besides  --  I 'm not sure it would help Julian . " " Sinjie  --  is n't there anything I can do to help Julian ? " " Not yet , " he sighed , and laid his hand on her hair . " Not yet , sweetheart . He is going to take this war very hard . We must be patient . " " I never meant you to know , " she whispered , leaning against him , obscurely comforted , and his arm tightened round her . " I knew , " he said . " But it is getting complicated . " Very complicated , he was thinking  --  with single-hearted Tibby growingup before their eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand in hand in closest understanding , when Julian was announced and stood looking at them gauntly from the doorway . " Burgoyne has surrendered at Saratoga , " he said in a dazed sort of way . " His whole army . They are saying at the Raleigh that now France will come in on our side . That is good news too . But merciful God , St. John , will there never be an end to this thing ? " St. John was leaning forward in his chair , his eyes ablaze on Julian 's white face . Burgoyne  --  yes , great news  --  and France  --  wonderful news , about France ! But " On whose side ? " he demanded unbelievingly . " On whose side did you say ? " " On ours , of course , " said Julian . " America 's . " When Dorothea had gone off to bed , they sat a long time with a bottle of wine between them , and their talk was desultory and intimate as of old . Something of recent constraint and caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not just because Burgoyne had surrendered , not because the French might come in , not because the tide might be turning  --  but because they both understood at last that they were after all on the same side . It was no volte face on Julian 's part  --  rather it was a slow , inevitable growth , a gradual accretion of perspective . He was not yet ready to go out and shoot redcoats . But he knew now where his troubled heart lay . He had ceased to be a Tory.  | St. John could talk to him tonight to ease his own laden soul , of things he had thought to keep locked within himself : of the privations and humiliations endured by his men in the ill-provisioned ranks beforePhiladelphia , dependent on the bungling , bewildered , incompetent Congress from which most of the stronger spirits had now departed to serve in their own State legislatures . Congress was full of bogies  --  it dreaded a powerful army , a powerful commander-in-chief , even a powerfulorganization of itself  --  so that for fear of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall apart of its own weight . Looking worn and lean as a rake in the firelight , St. John told how one 's senses were shocked with the sights and sounds and smells of fellowcreatures perishing for lack of care and the bare essentials in what passed for hospitals and rest camps . The regimental surgeons were swamped , and useless wounded who could get about by themselves had to be literally turned out on the charity of the countryside , where people barred their doors against them , or feigned absence , in the effort to preservetheir scanty comforts for the use of their own families . It was little wonder that enlistment lagged when broken stragglers returned home to tell of their own bitter experience in the army . Soap and vinegar and shoes were almost entirely lacking in the ranks . At Morristown men had sat up all night by the fires because there were not enough blankets to go round . He told of the pathetic march of the Continental troops through Philadelphia on their way to what ended at Brandywine  --  at least a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and many had pieced out inadequate costumes with bits of blanket and flour bags and even British scarlet . Some were near to reeling with weakness , all were scraggy from an irregular diet  --  but every mother 's son of them was as clean as he could make himself , and some with flour in their hair for powder , and for martial plumes each one had stuck a fresh green sprig into his hat , and they stepped out smartly to live up to Washington ridingat their head on a sleek Virginia horse in his miraculously preserved fine raiment , and Lafayette , resplendent in the best Continental uniform money could buy , who rode at his side . It was enough to break your heart , cried St. John , to see the men that day and the brave show they made  --  only to lose the battle because of a muddle about fords and backpI49roads , and General Sullivan in trouble again as usual ! Washington was superhuman , exposing himself recklessly to rally the men , seeming to be everywhere at once . And Lafayette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his troops  --  his aide , Gimat , threw him on a horse just in time . The men adored the Marquis . It was Greene , though , who saved them from an utter rout -- a great lumbering lovable man who had been horn a Rhode Island Quaker , and who showed now a steadfast genius for command . If anything should happen to Washington , which God forbid , Greene would be the next best general ... . And then , out of one of their companionable silences , filled with the ringing of bells in the town for the victory at Saratoga " It will be a long war , Julian  --  even with France 's help  --  a desperate , bloody business , still  --  " " Something must have gone very wrong with Burgoyne , " Julian suggested . " Our man was Gates . Do you happen to know anything about him ? " " Lord God above ! " said St. John blankly . " Are they saying Gates took Burgoyne ? " He gave a loud , rude shout of laughter . " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Gates , my eye ! " roared St. John , while Julian stared . " Gates is a summer soldier , hanging round Congress , trying to undermine Washington ! I 'll take my oath he had nothing to do with winning the battle ! Schuyler was doing all the work up there the last I heard . How did Gates get in ? I must get back to headquarters , things are really going to pieces ! Well , anyway  --  " He raised his glass . " God give us France , and quickly ! " " I do n't quite understand it , " Julian ruminated . " Kings usually hang together , and Louis would hardly like to see a brother monarch defeated by his subjects . " " Revenge , " said St. John . " Louis has no love for America , nor for free men . But he loves the English still less . Do n't forget , we were so tactless as to win our last war with France ! They have been waiting for this , hoping for it , ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I do n't say Louis ' motives are lofty , but if he will send us a fleet , I wo n't ask why ! " He filled Julian 's glass and his own , and reached for the poker to push a charred log further into the flame . It was Julian who broke the pause this time.  | " I have been a little worried about Tibby , " he began , and St. John glanced at him humorously . " I should n't wonder , " he murmured . " You have noticed the same thing , then , " said Julian , assuming with some relief that St. John shared his own wrongheaded conclusion that Tibby 's heart was set on the one man who was certain to marry Regina . " For some time , " St. John nodded , believing that Julian was aware at last that Tibby would never be even remotely concerned with any other man in the world save the schoolmaster . " Did she  --  have you ever spoken of it with her ? " " Good grief , man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am ? " demanded St. John . " I could n't speak of it , any more than I could strip her naked ! Besides , it 's all still in the bud . She hardly knows herself how it is with her . " " She knows enough to be jealous of Regina , " Julian informed him ruefully . " I shall take a cane to Regina one of these days , " St. John promised darkly . " And when I do , do n't you come trying to stay my hand , Julian ! I have warned you before . Not just because I mean to marry her myself  --  not so much that as because I am devilish fond of you , old sobersides , and I do n't want to see you driven right out of your mind , understand ? " His eyes rested with their clear , childlike frankness on Julian 's averted face . " She has no use for the likes of us nowadays , " said Julian . " David Allen is in New York with a King 's commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaping in his chair . " What regiment ? " " Simcoe 's Rangers . " " Simcoe , eh ! Well , it 's a real fighting corps he has got himself into , even if they do wear pretty green hussar coats and tight breeches ! So that 's the kind of blankety-blank sons-of-so-and-so 's she calls her friends now , is it ! " And in the flow of language which followed and the wrathful emptyingof the bottle , Tibby was forgotten and neither one of them knew that they had been talking about her entirely at cross purposes . Soon after Christmas St. John was off , still hobbling with a cane , to rejoin his regiment in winter quarters at a place in Pennsylvania calledp151Valley Forge , and the Francis Street household was empty and aimless again . His letters were far between , and some of them got lost on the road , but there was a long one during May which described the celebration at Valley Forge of the French treaty of alliance  --  a full parade of the starving , ragged troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war began  --  and the feu de joie of musketry running along the lines , and the hoarse , glad shout : " The American States ! "  --  and the officers ' so-called banquet , and the toasts , and the new lift to Washington 's chin . He wrote that Clinton had succeeded the easygoing Howe in cornmandof the British forces in America , and that no British general with a grain of sense would now attempt to hold Philadelphia , what with a French fleet due over the horizon any minute . And sure enough , in June Clinton began an elaborate evacuation of the city , with Washington'sdogged , indomitable army at his heels . Francis Street had to wait nearly a month for St. John 's version of the battle of Monmouth , which had been fought to a draw in swelteringJune heat . " You will have heard that Clinton got away to New York , " he wrote . " He had to leave his dead unburied to do it , and abandon most of his wounded . Admiral D'Estaing arrived with the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The day of the battle was hotter than the hinges , and darkness fell too soon . Everything went wrong on our side , and Washington swore like an angel from heaven , until it was a privilege to hear him . " I am whole and hearty and full of chagrin . It was our chance to trounce them , and we missed it . The British are now pretty well back where they started from , and there is still no end in sight . " No end in sight . And there the dreary prospect lay throughout the autumn of 1778 and until December , when bad news began to arrive from the opposite direction . Having failed to smash Washington or to lead him into a trap and capture him , Clinton sent Colonel Campbell south by sea at the end of the year , and Williamsburg learned with a sinking sensation that the British had actually taken Savannah . By spring the invading army wasp152spreading northward , gathering Loyalist forces as it went , and General Lincoln hurried down from the north , overland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing in on Virginia now . Portsmouth was defenseless . Norfolk was still in ruins . Yorktown lay open on the sea way to Williamsburg  --  wherewould the British be brought to a stand ? Thomas Jefferson succeeded Patrick Henry as Governor of Virginia that summer , and on his urgent recommendation the capital and legislature were moved up the James to Richmond , where records , stores , and the governingbody were less liable to capture by a sea borne army . With Palace and Capitol deserted , and people like Mr. Randolph and Mr. Mason absent most of the time , Williamsburg felt oddly naked and empty . Dorothea received a proposal of marriage in June , from a dashing youngster who was off to join Lincoln in Carolina . She refused him with such kindness and confusion that he departed still hoping , and Aunt Anabel sighed and dratted the war , which was robbing her lovely niece of the swarm of suitors which was her due . Georgia , disorganized and overrun , offered little resistance as 1779 rolled on , and a slave population less loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible advantage . In the Carolina back country bitter feeling arose between Loyalist and Patriot neighbors , who shamelessly betrayed each other in the interest of the cause . The British were quick to profit by the internal strife in the South , and cruel reprisals began on both sides amongst the colonists . " They say that Clinton himself has sailed from New York with nearly ten thousand men to take Charleston , " Julian wrote in his journal , now in its third volume , early in 1780 . " We have not heard from St. John since Christmas , when he wrote to say that this winter in the old camp at Morristown was worse , if possible , than last year at Valley Forge . " There is a rumor that Washington is sending all his southern troops , including the Virginia regiments , down to reinforce Lincoln . They are determined to hold Charleston at all costs , and Clinton has failed there once before . This time , however , he has an active and organized land force already in the field . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington has proved too much for the English generals . Everyone hopes that ifp153things get really bad  --  if , for instance , the British should take Charleston  --  Washington will come down himself to direct our campaign . " At this point his pen had come to a stop while he contemplated the echo in his written words of that first day in the coach , when St. John had said , We can be pushed just so far . We . He and the colonists . And Julian had learned with surprise that St. John was English-born like himself . Now , on the freshly written page of his own journal , our campaign . He realized that like St. John he had come to identify himselfcompletely with the colonists . He too had taken root here , meant to live and die here , like George Wythe and the rest who only a few years ago had still called England home . How had it come about , he wondered , while odd flashes of memory supplied odd , fragmentary answers : the dignity and magnetism of George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an injured child ; thy people shall be my people  --  out of the twilighton Mrs. Hartley 's front steps as Tibby stood before him with her arm in a sling ; the peal of a churchbell penetrating oblivion in the room above the school , and the worn , sweet face of Sarah Mawes as she sat beside his bed ; the dominie 's little hoard , bequeathed without question to the Winchester scholar who had come to take his place  --  hand knowledgeon ; the strength and fire and lilt of St. John 's nature , which had flung him headlong into this cause they both believed to be right ; Aunt Anabel 's gay , loving ways , and Dorothea 's damask beauty ; all the rest of them , from Mr. Wythe to the Spragues ' black Joshua , friendly , openhanded , confiding , ready and willing that he should be one of them , withholding nothing from him just because he had come to them a penniless stranger , anxious only that he should at once feel at home among them and should lack for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His people now , holding his daily life in their warm , gentle hands , possessing all his heart . . . . Well , not quite all . There was Regina Greensleeves , who preferred a man who joined Simcoe 's Rangers . . . . His pen was moving again , down the page . " As soon as we can learn where St. John is , I will go to him , and leave it to his good sense to determine how I can be most useful henceforth.  | I have never fired a musket in my life , and am not at all sure of my ability to lead men into and out of danger , though I presume I can stand fire myself . I can ride , and use a sword , and possibly if there is a cavalry regiment forming I could find a place in that . " It is when I think of Tibby and Aunt Anabel and  --  the others , in the possible line of fire , that I feel I must somehow place myself between them and harm . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty well eliminated my bone-deep prejudice against going to war against my countrymen . Henceforth I am truly a Virginian . " If the British take Charleston they will take Norfolk , and soon after that they will be in the streets of Williamsburg . They must be stopped before then , somehow . This endless , indecent war between Englishmen must be stopped . It need never have begun but for one man , an outsider , and I think now more than a little mad , with the obstinate Guelph itch to dominate , and too much power . But it is a strange feeling , all the same , to have no king . Who takes his place ? I suppose the answer is Washington . He has dignity and compassion , without which no man has the right to command loyalty from his fellow human beings . " Julian was dining in Francis Street that day early in June of 178o when Williamsburg learned that Charleston was lost . There was a brooding sense of unreality over the meal , though everythingseemed exactly as usual  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service , the solicitous bend of Joshua 's broad back above the proffered dishes . Julian sat between the two women , and they tried not to talk on and on about the war , which until then had been remote and a little hard to keep track of . Even with St. John away fighting , they did not quite realize the war  --  for he had been away before , on peaceful errands . One could forget , even with shirtmen drilling on the Palace Green , that America was at death grips , if one lived in Williamsburg and it was summer time , and the roses were in bloom . But the British in Charleston  --  a whole American army taken prisoners  --  at Charleston  --  surely one would wake up soon and know it all for nightmare ! The dreadful story of Charleston 's surrender had come up slowly , overland . They pieced it together in low voices while they ate , pooling rumor and hearsay  --  what Julian had heard at the College and the Raleigh  --  what Mr. Greensleeves had written his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coachman . General Lincoln was a prisoner of war , as everybody knew ; Lord Rawdon , with British and Hessian troops , Tarleton 's famous cavalry , and Cornwallis had all arrived at Charleston from New York with reinforcements for Clinton ; there were hangings and confiscation and terror in Charleston among people alleged by the British to have broken their paroles , unwillinglygiven , not to take up arms in the Patriot cause , and inhabitants roundabout the city were flocking to take the oath of allegiance to save their skins and their property ; Clinton was garrisoning Camden , Augusta , Ninety-Six , and other points in the Carolina interior ; armed bands , both Loyalist and Whig , were plundering and intimidating the countryside ; the British had turned brutal on this southern campaign , and were carrying off at will everything from silver to slaves , while Tarleton 's green-clad dragoons became a byword for ruthless raiding .... Jefferson as Governor at Richmond had admitted freely in a letter to Mr. Wythe that there was very little to oppose the British advance on Virginia except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under General de Kalb who had been rushed south in an attempt to rescue Lincoln , and who were now at Richmond trying to accumulatesupplies of food , wagons , and horses . And over the Francis Street dinner table , between alternate hope and despair , they speculated about what Washington would do to save his own beloved Virginia from Carolina 's fate . They wanted Washington there with his army , and they wanted St. John . Then , they felt , they could face things . Hating to rob them of the illogical comfort they drew from his own presence , in the way of women who see an able-bodied man within reach , Julian said at the end of the meal " I am going to Richmond tomorrow . " They stared at him , stricken . " F-for long ? " quavered Aunt Anabel , guessing the answer.  | " Yes . I sha n't come back till the war is won . " " Oh , Julian , I 'm glad you said won , " said Dorothea softly . " You used not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of a fool than I am now , " he confessed brusquely . " I do n't know how or when  --  but it has got to be won . Else this country wo n't be fit for people like you to live in , " he finished , and laid his hand over Aunt Anabel 's with impulsive tenderness . " But I thought at least you would wait till we heard from Sinjie , " she objected . " I ca n't wait any longer . " " Julian  --  " Dorothea leaned to look into his face . "  --  that does n't mean you think we wo n't hear  --  ? " He gave her his other hand , and sat linked to them both , his heart wrung by their helplessness and their faith in his omniscience . " No , it does n't mean that at all , " he assured them hastily . " If St. John 's regiment is on the move he may not be allowed to send word of his whereabouts . Or if he did write , the post-bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons why we do n't hear from him , but you will get a letter soon , you 're bound to . " " You could ask them at Richmond . " Aunt Anabel discovered some consolation in the idea . " You could ask de Kalb , since he has just come down from Morristown . " " Yes , my dear , I could ask de Kalb , " he agreed . " And while I am away , will you please keep an eye on the twins for me ? See that they have whatever they need  --  I will leave some money with you to cover it . " " You will take your money with you , " said Aunt Anabel firmly . " And be sure I will do everything I can for them , but Sarah is so stiffneckedand proud she smells charity in the very rain from heaven . " As they rose from the table , Aunt Anabel laid trembling lips against his cheek , murmured something about a parcel for his journey , and went away , blowing her nose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harpsichord , idly fingering the keys with one hand , fighting for composure . He came and stood near her , and took the slim , faltering fingers in his . " You must n't be unhappy about this , " he said gently . " I have n't felt right about things since St. John put on a uniform , you know ! " " You are n't like Sinjie . He loves a fight  --  always has . "  | " I wish I were more like him , " he admitted simply . " He is the kind they need to win the war . I shall just have to do the best I can . " There was a silence between them , her hand lying warm in his . She seemed to be waiting for something . Slowly she turned to him , lifting her face to see him better , and laid her other hand on his shoulder . " Good luck , Julian . I  --  we will be thinking of you  --  praying for you  --  every day . Promise to come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he repeated gravely , and looked away from her round the gracious room , the only home he had ever known . " And I shall always remember this house , no matter where I am . You have been very good to me , you and Aunt Anabel . You know , " he smiled , " even before you came , they promised me a sister . " Dorothea snatched her hand away and stepped back , her chin well up . He had never seen her angry before . " I am not your sister ! " she cried , and stamped her foot at him . " I 'm not even kissing kin to you , and I 'll thank you to remember it ! " And she was gone , with a rustle of silk , into the hall and up the stairs , on flying feet . A door slammed . Julian looked after her , astonished and rather hurt . He had had no idea of presuming to kiss her . He found his hat on the table in the hall and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was going to Richmond she assumed that he would ask for a commission , and when he doubted his fitness as an officer , she opened her eyes and inquired if he had lost his mind entirely , and just what did he intend to do . " What they seem to need now is a lot of men to carry muskets and shoot them off at people in red coats , " he told her patiently . " I thought perhaps I could learn to do that . " " In the ranks ? " cried Regina . " But that is even worse than St. John ! " " I am afraid it will be some time before I am as good as St. John . " " But , Julian , you ca n't serve as a common soldier ! You would die of it in a week ! " Somehow her sureness of that caught him on the raw , and he answered with a spirit he seldom showed to her . " I am getting into this war now , the quickest way I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biting cartridges under fire , that is the way it will be ! "  | " St. John will be pleased ! " was all she could find to say to that . " Why do n't you go and take orders from him ? " " I should like to . But we do n't know where he is . " " Have n't you heard from him ? " she asked quickly , for as the war dragged on she was haunted more and more by a memory of her own voice crying , I hope you never come back ! and a memory still more relentlessof St. John 's white face  --  and she too wished now that she had n't said it , would have given the tongue out of her head to have the thoughtless , cruel words unsaid  --  and sometimes in the night another voice which came from her heart reiterated that it would serve her right if he never came back . . . . " Have n't you heard from him ? " she implored quickly . " Not for some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for the summer campaign . Washington will be on the move from there . " " He ca n't move far from New York ! He dare n't turn his back on the British there ! " " Regina , do n't let 's quarrel over Washington now , " he pleaded . " I 'm not quarrelling over anybody ! " she denied indignantly . " I hate to see my friends make fools of themselves , that 's all ! Even St. John has a commission ! " " Even David Allen has one , " he reminded her . " A better one than St. John 's ! " she laughed . " You might at least join the right army , Julian ! " " I am joining the right army  --  the one that is fighting for a man 's right to his own opinions and the life he wants to live and a hand in his own government . It is n't England that sends a gang of bullies in red coats to dispute that right with us . It is a King and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a German accent  --  " " Oh , Julian , you sound like a Continental Congress ! I wo n't listen ! " " You do n't have to listen . I did n't come here today to argue the Patriots ' cause with you . " He stood watching her sadly from across the room . " I only came to look at you once more  --  to hear your voice . I know I have no right , as St. John 's friend , to say these things to you , but I know too that they wo n't matter very much , one way or the other , in the end . It is St. John you love , and that is as it should be . " She started to interrupt him then , but he overruled her without raising his voice and went on . " Before I go I only want to say  --  I love you , Regina . Ever sincep159that first day at Yorktown . You do n't have to answer , or pretend to be surprised or say you 're sorry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say . And then , good-bye . " He went towards her slowly and she rose to meet him . Her breath came between parted lips , her blue eyes were wide and waiting . His simple sincerity moved her deeply as it always did , and there was more than her wilful coquetry in the warm surrender of her hands to his . He stood looking down at her for a long moment before he could speak . " If things were a little different , " he said , " I might be asking you to marry me . " " If things were only a little different , " she whispered in all honesty , " I might be saying Yes . " He kissed her , his hands holding hers  --  a boy 's kiss , gentle and undemanding . " Thank you , " he said , and went . The sun was low behind the trees and the quick southern dusk was near when he came to himself , he had no idea how much later , in the lane beyond the Capitol . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading down to Tibby 's home were pale in the shadows . He paused a moment and stood staring towards the cabin in a daze . Yes , of course  --  he could not go away without seeing Tibby . He crossed the lane . Kit was hoeing in the garden patch beside the gate . " Is Tibby there ? " Julian called to him . " Yes , sir . Shall I fetch her out ? " " Please . " He leaned against the gate-post and it swayed drunkenly under his elbow . He waited for Tibby , his eyes on the last bright streaks of sunlightwhich caught the treetops along the Creek . He must talk to her alone . No more fuss . Tibby would n't make a fuss ... . She came to him swiftly down the path , with her greenish eyes shining . She wore her pigtails pinned in a tight knot on the nape of her neck now , and carried her head high on its slender stem . Her still childishbody was clothed tonight in a faded cotton print gown with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw him from the window as he crossed the lane . Mrs. Hallam had closed the school for lack of pupils , and now Tibby did the fine laundry and household jobs her mother was becoming too frail to accomplish alone . Julian was so accustomed to her scrupulous tidiness that it never occurred to him to wonder that she could spend a sultry day ironing gauze caps and fichus and then present herself to him looking as crisp and sweet as morning . She made him her curtsy just inside the gate . " Good evening , sir . " He glanced behind him , where the lane ran on towards the Landing and the new stone bridge with a wooden railing above the sluggish water . It was not much used these days . " Will you come with me ? " he asked , and unquestioningly she opened the gate and came through it to walk at his side . By the time they reached the sandy planks of the bridge the first fireflieswere gleaming in the bushes , and the twilight chorus of tree-peepers had begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro dozing in a rowboat which waited with its nose against the muddy bank and its painter knotted to a post at the bottom of the steps . Julian took off his hat and leaned his elbows on the railing above the water , and stood looking down . Tibby hooked her heels over the bottom rail and hoisted herself up with the ease of habit , to sit facing him beside where his elbows rested . This brought their heads almost on a level , and whereas he stood gazing into the slack water below them , she saw nothing but Julian Day almost under her hand  --  preoccupied as he often was in her presence ; in trouble , apparently , but seeking her company . " You are going to the war , " she said at last , and he smiled without meeting her eyes . " How did you know that ? " " I knew you would go , sooner or later . " " You wanted me to go , then . " " No , I wanted you to stay here . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You might have said something about it a little sooner . " " It 's soon enough , " she sighed . " I have been dreading it . What will become of the school ? " " Closed , till the war is won . All the older boys have gone , anyway . And you will think better of me , all the same , when I am in the army . " " I could n't think better of you than I always have . " " Were n't you ever ashamed of me , Tibby  --  for not taking sides ? " Hep161raised his eyes from the water to her face , and they seemed to her to he pleading for something she did not know how to give . " I wonder you did n't disown me , when Mr. Sprague went north . " Tibby looked back at him mutely , while her heart pounded somewhereat the top of her throat , and the piercing music of the peepers was drowned in the song of her own young blood in her veins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time  --  years , maybe . Never before had she seen him levelly like this , eyes to eyes  --  the shadow his dark lashes cast , the way his hair grew reddish round his ears , the strong , generous curve of his mouth  --  Tibby gripped the railing on either side of her and struggled against giddiness . It crossed her mind to tell him that you ca n't disown God , but that would sound profane , so she said nothing and prayed instead that she would not topple backwards into the water . " Poor Tibby , " he was saying . " Why do you put up with me ? No one else can . " " Was Miss Regina very angry , " she asked astutely , " because you are going to the war ? " " According to Miss Regina , I am joining the wrong army , " he confessedwith a wry smile . " Her and that David Allen ! " Tibby lifted her nose . " Now , how on earth did you ever hear of him ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about David Allen , but it hurts him just the same . Is it true that she never saw him all that time he was here wounded ? " " Yes . It is true . " " She does n't deserve him . " " She loves him , though , Tibby . We might as well make up our minds to that , you and I. " He laid his arm across her lap to the rail on the other side of her . It was a gesture to comfort a child , and to steady her on her perch . It brought their left shoulders near together as he leaned a little towards her , holding the rail beyond . She wondered if he would notice her heart pounding a few inches away from his sleeve . She wondered what he would think if she bent forward and laid her cheek just once against his and begged him not to mind so much about Miss Regina , who deserved nothing better than David Allen anyway . You and I. What did he mean by that ? It sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstinate conviction that it was St. John she had set her heart on . " All this about David Allen , " he was saying , " that is just to save her pride . But if she married him  --  or anyone else  --  it would he only to spite Mr. Sprague , you know that , do n't you ? And you want him to have a chance to be happy with her when he comes back from the war  --  do n't you , child ? " " Why , yes , of course , " agreed Tibby , who would never have questionedSt . John 's right to happiness with whatever woman he chose . But anyone could see what the trouble was , just as she had long suspected . " Oh , Mr. Day , " she cried , and laid her arms around him , " I 'm so sorry you want her too ! " " We must try not to  --  not to grudge it them , must n't we . " And with an odd breathless sound he hid his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with awe and amazement . He was breaking his heart over Regina Greensleeves , but he was here in the mothering arms of Tibby Mawes , where he had come of his own accord , seeking comfort . It was quite dark now , with the moon still below the trees . The ancientNegro apparently slept in the bottom of the boat , the peeper chorus grew in volume , the fireflies were myriad . Intoxicated with her own daringin the fragrant , pulsing night , she laid her face against Julian 's hair . He seemed not to notice . She racked her brains for anything to offer him in his need , for philosophy or consolation for his trouble . " Would you like me to say you a piece ? " she whispered dubiously , and he nodded against her shoulder while his arm tightened to draw her closer . " Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night , ' " said Tibby with her cheek against his hair . " Nor for the arrow that flieth by day ; nor for the pestilence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at noonday . A thousand shall fall at thy side , and ten thousand at thy right hand ; but it shall not come nigh thee . There shall no evil befall thee , neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling . For He shall give His angels charge over thee , to keep thee in all thy ways . They shall bear thee up in their hands , lest thou dash thy foot against a stone : " After a long moment he stirred , and lifted his head slowly , and leaned again on the railing , his arm still lying across her lap . She let his weightp163go from her reluctantly , her fingers lingering on his coat . It was too dark now to see his face . " You 're sweet , Tibby , " he said . " You 're sweet and strong and very wise . How are you so wise at your age ? " It crossed her mind to tell him that she was old enough now , surely , to work things out for herself and be of some use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance  --  if only people would stop thinking of her as a child , just because she stayed so small . It was no child 's love she felt for him any more , she knew , still tingling as she was with the warmth and size of him in her arms , still dizzy with the pomaded scent of his hair against her face . This was the lord of her world , she knew , and there would never be any other . But how could one presume to point it out to him , and he the schoolmaster  --  how could one say to him , even in the shielding dark , that there was nothing he could ask of her that was not already his ? Take me instead , she might have said  --  I 'm not beautiful , I 'm not a lady born , I 'm not very old , but I 'm yours , and maybe I 'll grow  --  take me , for your comforting , I 'll never ask for more . But he had left his heart with Regina Greensleeves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment passed . " You are a silent creature too , " he murmured in the dark , and now there was a smile in his low voice . " Be not silent to me , Tibby , lest I become like them that go down into the pit . " " Oh , Mr. Day ! " she gasped . " That 's sacrilege ! " " Is it , my dear ? To implore you , as I have done , to find me a ransom , and bring back my soul from the pit where it seems to dwell along with Job 's ? " " I would do anything I could for you , " she said , too simply for diffidence . " I would be the ransom , if you  --  if you  --  " " You are braver than I am , Tibby , " he said ruefully . " To hear you , one would think you had nothing to bear yourself . " " I do n't know what you mean , " she said helplessly . " If only I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war with you . If only I were Kit , you would not have to go alone ! " " If only you were a boy we might go and drown our sorrows in persimmonbeer tonight ! " he said with an effort at cheerfulness , and straightened from the railing . In the dark his hands found her shoul- ders and he lifted her down . Someone was coming along the lane with a lantern , a man 's voice shouted for Bide , and the old Negro answered from the rowboat against the bank . " As it is , I shall now see you safely home . You had better take my hand , or we may both end in the ditch after all ! " " The moon will be up soon . " Her small fingers slid gratefully into his clasp . " We could see our way home better then . " " We can see it now , between us . " He moved towards the oncoming lantern . " They will think we are a courting couple , " he remarked , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but could not , because of Regina Greensleeves . " When do you go ? " she asked instead , as they picked their way along the dusty lane . " Tomorrow morning . " " So soon ? " she said faintly . " The sooner the better now . " " And what will you do ? " " Whatever they tell me to , at Richmond . " " They need horses . " " Yes , I shall trade mine in for a musket . " " And will you wear a uniform like Mr. Sprague ? " " Mr. Sprague is an officer . I shall have to wear a hunting shirt , no doubt . " They walked in silence for a while , her hand in his , and the lighted windows of her home lay just ahead as the moon broke out , strong and golden , above the treetops . Just three minutes more , she was thinking  --  two minutes  --  one minute more , and he will be gone , and there will be nothing left but waiting and emptiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for years been without the hope of a sight of him each day . They paused at her gate , and he stood looking down at her , bareheadedin the moonlight , her hand in his . " Well , Tibby  --  this is good-bye . " " You will send me word sometimes ? " " I 'll try to . But it wo n't be easy , you know . " " I  --  I 'm not so very brave after all , " she discovered , and suddenly leaned against him , a hand at her throat . " Why , Tibby  --  " He was infinitely touched . " Tibby , you are n't goingp165to cry  --  I have n't seen you cry since that day at Jamestown  --  child , will you miss me so much ? " She wanted to sob at him that you must miss the air you breathe and the light of the sun in the heavens , but if he could not see for himself that without him you were beggared and useless and maimed , what was the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stood away from him , breathing through her nose . " I 'm sorry , sir  --  I was acting like a cry-baby . Good-bye , sir . " " Good-bye . " She looked so small under the moon , so straight , so alone and defenseless . He bent swiftly and kissed her cheek . " Good-bye , sweetheart . And God keep you . " " Thank you , sir , " said Tibby unsteadily  --  and then because it was bad luck to watch a person out of sight , she hid her face in her arms on top of the gate while his footsteps receded into the dark.  |p167The  hot sun was coming up behind him as Julian rode out of Williamsburg that morning in early June of 1780 . In his saddlebags 1 carried two changes of linen , a warm extra waistcoat , spare stockin and queue ribbons , a bachelor 's sewing kit without a thimble , toil articles including a razor and a cake of soap , a brandy flask , a packet food , and two small volumes  --  Dryden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as yet unexplored purchase . He took the river road which ran left of the College  --  the road alor which he had set out on another June morning with the twins for picnic on the bank at Jamestown  --  that day when they had heard abo Bunker Hill . Five years ago  --  and it seemed a lifetime . This was h seventh Virginia June ; the long hot days and sweet sudden nightfal filled with Negro melody ; the mingled scent of dusty pink roses ar box hedges and herb gardens in the midday sun ; the silent miracle fireflies before the round yellow moon came up , and the tiny frog chc down by the Creek . Virginia  --  soft as a woman , stanch as a friend , ar always good to look at  --  he belonged to it now . It was home . Before long , as he rode beneath the tall cool pines , the turning while led down to Jamestown Island curved away on his left . He passed with a backward look and kept on his way up the river towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rank smoke of the steaming marsh as they crossed it that other morning when tl war had not yet really begun , for Virginia  --  the deep shade of the syc mores around the broken church and Tibby 's voice saying , " Tell abo the bride-ship "  --  Tibby laying out the picnic meal on a clean napkin spread on the grass and propping up the doll Julia to look on  --  Tibby 's grief , silent and quivering in his arms , so that he promised to stay in Virginia till he grew a long white beard . . . . And now here he was , riding out to war , with the long white beard becoming somewhat problematical . Tibby 's small brown hands had caught and held his life in a world , no longer new to him , where men did not hesitate to stand on their rights and did not flinch from shedding blood to maintain them  --  a violent , sore-beset world now , grim and groggy and battered , but still on its legs and fighting mad . Not children playing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebels who liked the sound of their own stirring phrases . Not two or three sullen cities defying from a safe distance a just and well-intentioned king . This was a new nation , a virile , lion-hearted chip of the old block , determined , as Englishmen always are , not to be browbeaten  --  much less browbeaten by a rank outsider of limited intelligence and mid-European ideas of government . This was the spirit of Runnymede abroad in a new land . This was a fight Englishmen had fought before and would doubtless have to fight again  --  a fight to preserve personal liberty and constitutional governmentfrom the encroachment of tyranny . As an Englishman , he belongedin this fight himself , on the side of the men who demanded the things England itself stood for , no matter who sat on the throne . It was not a state of mind he had easily recognized in himself  --  this strong necessity to go out and hit back at something . But gradually it grew on him . St. John always loved a fight , whether it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a healthy muck sweat , or a thunder of cannon and rattle of cavalry which was war  --  St. John took fire , he laughed aloud , his quick , hard body braced itself competentlyto shock and effort , he got something out of it , something which to him was joy . The Days were bookish men , uncombative , slow to anger , patient in adversity  --  but the iron strain was there , and a dogged sort of courage which never failed them . The fall of Charleston had reached that deep vein in Julian , as the war came home to him . Deliberately , as he did everything , he had made up his mind . Clinton must be stopped . And he personally must go and see that Clinton was stopped , else his life would not be worth the living any more , for he would havep169no right to things he was accustomed to think of as his , nor to the friendship of people he had come to love . I was a stranger . . . . But not any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His horse 's feet were clumping daintily over a stretch of corduroy road and he roused to glimpse the mansion called Green Spring through the pines . When Jamestown was the capital , Green Spring was the Governor 's country home , and old Lord Berkeley , the Cavalier Governor , had held his court there a hundred years ago . It belonged now to the Ludwells , who were abroad , and like their house in the Duke of Gloucester Street it was closed , but Julian had been granted permissionby the agent to see it in connection with the chapter on the Bacon Rebellion i his history . That too seemed a long time ago now . The history , painstakingly documented , lovingly penned , and copied fair and after anxious excisions and additions and more deletions copied again , had been bogged down for quite some time , at the chapter on the Stamp Act . He had stuck there , conscious of a growing difference between his own opinions and those his father had held . Or would not his father have changed too by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had laid the history aside , for it only underlined his difficulties . Now that he was clear in his mind again , now that he saw his way and had set his course , there was no time to finish the manuscript . When the war was won he could write books . But first .. . He left Green Spring behind and came to the slashes  --  a low wet regioncovered with pine , slippery to a horse 's feet , dismal and lonely to a rider . After about five miles of it the road emerged on the high sandy bank of the Chickahominy and there was the cheerful bustle of the ferry and the usual ticklish business of a nervous horse which would not trim the boat . Then he rode on through the slashes , and for the first time in years he was aware of America as a wilderness again  --  for this was the furthest he had ever penetrated into the back country , though he only followed a route often taken by Jefferson to his home near Charlottesville , and by St. John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years before the war took him north to his post at Washington'sside . Williamsburg seemed already very far behind . He came at last to Charles City Courthouse , where a chance conversationat the only inn revealed that de Kalb had moved down to Peters/burg and was there awaiting orders , reinforcements , supplies  --  he had need of them all . With him was an inadequate army of perhaps two thousand Continentals  --  veteran Maryland and Delaware troops . Presumablyhe knew what he was about , but with Charleston fallen his little corps had n't a hope unless reinforcements came in soon . Looking very thoughtful , Julian rode without hesitation to the nearestferry and crossed the James River , bound for Petersburg . It was a small town , easily swamped by even a small army . Julian dismounted in front of Pride 's Tavern , which was swarming with soldiers , and began to tie his reins to the hitching-bar . A rough-looking man in a sort of uniform of faded blue stuff with facings which had once been scarlet eased up beside him and spoke confidentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't leave that horse here alone by itself if I was you . " " Why not ? " asked Julian with a level look . " We need horses . You would n't be aimin ' to sell it ? " " I might . " The man spat lustily , more from swagger than from need . " How if I was to get you a good price for it ? " " Who are you ? " asked Julian , his tone polite , his eyes watchful . " Sergeant Appleby , Sixth Maryland . " " How 's recruiting , Sergeant ? " " Bad . " " You get me into the Sixth Maryland , and we 'll see about the horse , " Julian suggested , and the sergeant blinked . " Mean you figger to enlist ? " " Well , I thought it was about time , yes . Any vacancies ? " " Plenty . Where you from ? " " Williamsburg . " " Ai n't Virginia puttin ' any regiments into the field these days ? " " Militia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the war ? " " Till it 's won , yes . " " Glory be ! " murmured the sergeant mildly , and something like respectdawned in his hard black eyes . " Young feller , you come along with me  --  and bring that horse ! "  |p171Julian  followed him down the middle of the busy street , leading the horse , which drew covetous glances on every side . " You see , I have n't got a musket , " he explained , his long strides easily matching the sergeant 's . " So I thought  --  " " Muskets are plaguey scarce . Cartridge paper is scarcer still and wagons just ai n't . That 's what we 're waitin ' for  --  wagons . And ammunitionstores ai n't no good without cartridge paper . The Governor of this here state of yours  --  Jefferson  --  what 's he doin ' all this time ? " " He is an able man , I believe . " " Then where 's our cartridge paper ? Where 's our wagons ? Heard about Charleston ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Looks like we 'll need some help , eh ! " The sergeant laughed bitterly . " Wisht a few more of ' em felt the same way . Never been in the army ? " " No . I can fence , but that 's about all . " " Fancy swordwork , eh ! Not much good here . We use muskets and bayonets . " " Yes , I know . I have never handled either one . " " God above ! " breathed the sergeant . " Pistols , of course , but  --  " " Ca n't figger you out , quite . What 's your trade ? " " I am a schoolmaster . " " That so ? I mighta known . " The sergeant eyed him with new interest . " Greek and Latin ? " " Oh , yes . And Euclid ! That 's not much good here either , is it ? " " How 's your guts ? " " All right , I hope , " said Julian briefly , and the sergeant nodded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had caught his rugged fancy . " Of course we 're a Maryland regiment , " said the sergeant with significance , and added on a sidelong glance , " You bein ' from Virginia puts you kinda out of step to begin with . Now , Baltimore 's a nice genteelplace  --  " " Very well , " Julian agreed promptly , " I 'm from Baltimore . " " You do n't say ! " exclaimed the sergeant in pleased surprise , and offeredto shake hands . " I 'm from Baltimore myself ! Funny I never run into you there ! But , say , I du n no , if you 've got a family in Williams-burg  --  " " I have n't . " " Rein ' wrote down from Baltimore , y'see , if anything happened , like , you would n't be on the Virginia casualty list , an '  --  but so long as you did n't leave an old mother or a best girl back there in Williamsburg  --  ? " He paused incredulously . " No , " said Julian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grim business of being a soldier . " Well , ye 're lucky , at that . I got two kids in Baltimore  --  kinda like to live to see ' em grow up . " " I hope you will , " said Julian simply . " Now , about that musket  --  " The sergeant laid a hand on his sleeve and pointed . They had come to some tents at the end of a lane leading out of the main street . Ahead of them passed a little procession carrying long bundles , each slung between the shoulders of two men who carried spades and pick-axes also . " Looks like we might have a spare musket or two , " he said , and gave a dry cough . " There goes the buryin ' party . " Thus after a somewhat dim ritual of enrollment rather glossed over in the circumstances , Julian found himself a private in the Sixth Maryland . With a final pang , he watched his pretty mare being led away , and because the sergeant had liked him at sight received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already placed him in the care of a friend in the ranks , Neddy Blake , for instruction in military life and etiquette , the common words of command , the drum-beats , and the inner mysteries of a musket . Neddy had a fine contempt for English shooting  --  the regulars were taught to point their muskets horizontally , brace themselves for the recoil , and pull the trigger , hoping the gun would go off  --  that way it took a man 's weight in lead to kill him , said Neddy , fondling his own gun and explaining further that she had such a tarnationrecoil you had to aim at the knee and let her kick the ball into their stomachs . Julian nodded wisely with his teeth on edge , and fingered his unfamiliarweapon patiently under Neddy 's guidance . It did not occur to him at all that the army might have a better use for a man who spoke three modern languages and wrote them in a fine , fast hand , than top173put him behind a musket he must learn how to fire . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you shot and were shot at . The nuances of staff and headquarters appointments were unknown to him . Neddy was a lean , hard-bitten man with a big nose  --  twice wounded but indestructible , nursing a grim and gnawing desire to see the war out wherever it carried him and however long it took . They sat together in the hot dusk beyond the cook-fires , slapping mosquitoes and downing mugs of soup , and Neddy 's talk rambled on while Julian listened attentively , storing away facts in his trained memory for contemplationat his leisure . The army at Petersburg had heard of Charleston 's fall only the day before , and it had been a bad blow . They were too late now , and too few , but they would keep on southward , hoping for reinforcements , harrying Clinton as much as possible , but of necessity keeping out of his reach . The Baron was no man to give up now , said Neddy with pride , and Julian saw that de Kalb was popular with his men . He had a French aide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Colonel Williams of the Sixth , now acting as adjutant , was a fine soldiering man . And then there was Armand 's Legion , a scant hundred and fifty cavalrymen , mostly Europeans , a tough , murdersome crew , wanting a very firm hand . General Gist was all right , the commander of this Maryland brigade , said Neddy , but General Smallwood , now , who had the First Brigade  --  well , he thought he knew more than the Baron , which did n't on the face of it make sense , the Baron having fought the Seven Years ' War abroad , and all . Some people made fun of the Baron for his frugality , but that was wrong too . The Baron was poor . He had to clothe himself out of his pay and buy his own horses , and he had to pay in Continentalmoney , which was now sixty dollars to one in gold ; he had to feed his orderlies and servants from his own table , he could not even afford the equipage he was entitled to for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean inns and private houses and was pitilessly overcharged . And now he could not even get cartridge paper out of the State of Virginia . He 'd seen better wars than this one , the Baron had . On the following day , what wagons they had were loaded with tents and a meager supply of foodstuffs , and the army began to move south- ward towards Hillsborough in Carolina , carrying its own baggage . The first few days were n't bad , though the relentless drums beat reveille in the gray light before dawn , and the general ( strike tents , pack up , call in the guards , and stand to arms ) came at six o'clock , and the march at seven . Except for shoulders aching from the unaccustomed weight of his musket and pack , and an uncommon amount of thirst , Julian stood it very well . He wore his own boots and tan breeches with a battered blue regimental coat which was a trifle short in the sleeves but otherwise a good fit , inherited like the musket from some Marylanderwho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through sandy , level country , southwest from Petersburg . Then , as they approached the Nottoway , the roads turned to red clay which rain made paste into which a man sank to his ankles and a horse to its knees . Wagons stuck in it up to the hubs , traces broke , wheels came off , axles gave way , increasing to danger point the loads of the wagons remaining in use . Equipment had to be abandoned , food began to run short , thunderstorms of incredible violence alternated with intolerable heat , and the bites of ticks and chiggers and mosquitoes were slow torture . By the time they reached Hillsborough , where they hoped for a junctionwith some militia from Virginia and North Carolina , Julian was walking in a daze of sore fatigue , lightheaded with a permanent hunger , unshaven , caked with the red clay , his sole idea to keep up with Neddy , not to fall out and get left behind , not to think , not to feel , just to keep going somehow . At Hillsborough they rested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Food was scarce in the barren countryside , but foraging parties brought in scraggy fowls and now and then a lean cow or a bag of corn . And food was less important for a while , if only you could stop walking , and tend your feet , and mend your clothes , and find water for a shave , and feel like a man again . The militia , when it came , was scanty and ill-equipped and as hungry as anybody . There seemed to be no orders awaiting de Kalb at Hillsborough , and very little news . Clinton was said to have left Cornwallis to finish the job in the South , and returned to New York for another go at Washington . Nobody knew just where Cornwallis was now , but his next in command , young Lord Rawdon , was at Camden , and ap175makeshift design was evolved to harry his outposts and foraging parties in that vicinity till more ambitious plans could be laid . During the halt at Hillsborough , while Julian was doing a job of sentry-go , he saw an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty of them , of all ages , well mounted and armed , but ragged and variously clad , and among them several big buck Negroes . They all wore black leather caps with a silver badge , and they were led by a thin , dark , frail-looking man with a closed , uncommunicative face . Their appearance was so completely unmilitary and their bearing so diffident that jests and jeers from the almost equally unpresentable Continentals followed them all the way to headquarters , where the thin man dismounted and walked with a noticeable limp into the building . Contrary to general expectations , he remained there with de Kalb a long time . Neddy was not on sentry duty that day , and Neddy always circulated and got the news . Julian at his post saw Neddy in his characteristically casual conversation with one of the stranger 's men while the horses were being watered , and knew a twinge of envy for Neddy 's happy faculty of sliding into friendship with all corners . And as was to be expected , Neddy could hand out the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the evening meal . " Yep , " said Neddy with his mouth full , " that there was Francis Marion , as ever is . " He affected a mild , indulgent surprise at the lack of intelligent comment from his hearers . " Ai n't you heard , " he inquired of them maddeningly , " ai n't none of you dolts ever heard before of this here Francis Marion ? " Nobody had . They admitted it impatiently , awaiting exposition . " Why , he 's an Indian fighter from down Charleston way , he is . He was with Moultrie in ' 76 when they beat off the redcoats there , and he was with Lincoln last spring , too , only guess what happened . " He paused impressively . No one spoke . " Well , I 'll tell you what happened , " he obliged then , pleased to see that his audience was growing . " Seems this feller Marion just naturally do n't approveof cards and drinkin ' . And one night a bunch of his team-mates thought to make him join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , sort of prankin ' round , so 's he could n't leave . He left , though . By the window . But he had to jump for it and in doin ' so he broke his ankle and had to be invalided out for a spell . Yessir , and that busted ankle was all that saved him from bein ' in Charleston with the rest when Lincoln surrendered , and b'God that 's why he was n't captured along with all the other officers ! " " That 's a very moral tale , Neddy , " Julian suggested affectionately . " I hope you will let it be a lesson to you . " " That 's the way they told it to me , " Neddy insisted . " So where did this Marion get his army ? " asked a voice . " They 're all friends of hisn  --  people who could arm themselves and live on next to nothin ' . Yes , and masterless slaves too  --  he do n't keer what color you are so long as you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you ca n't shoot straight , you straightway lose your gun to somebody that can , he do n't waste no time lugging around fellers that ca n't hit ' em right where the belt crosses ! " " And what did he want with the Baron ? " " Did n't want nothing ' , " said Neddy . " Came in to offer his services . " " Rode out agin , did n't he ? " " All but one man , " said Julian unexpectedly . " How 's that agin ? " Their eyes swung round to where he sat . " He left one of his men here  --  name of Horry . Captain Horry . Wo n't let anybody touch his horse , will he , Neddy ? " " No , sir , treats that horse like it was a baby ! I offered to rub it down fer him myself  --  . like to git my hands on a good horse now and again . He done it all himself , though . Kind of lonesome , maybe , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Left him what fer ? " inquired a voice . " He 's to be aide and guide to the Baron on the march . The Baron 's a smart one , and do n't you fergit it . He 'd ruther have Marion 's gang out in the swamps loose on the British than tied up with us . They 're like foxes , those fellers  --  once they go to earth nobody can find ' em till they 're ready to show  --  nobody but another one of the same kind . That 's why we 've got Horry  --  could n't get no word to Marion without him . I got an idea we 're goin ' to need Captain Horry ! " Early in July the exhausted army under de Kalb reached the Deep River and paused again at Buffalo Ford for recuperation and provisions . The State of North Carolina had made no arrangement for the subsistanceof the troops which had been sent to protect it . The new crops had not yet ripened and the population itself was living on the rem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders to commandeer only a reasonable part of each farmer 's supply , leaving him something for himself , but though these orders were as a rule conscientiously carriedout by the officers in charge there was a widening circle of resentmentand hardship round the camp . A strong detachment of Carolina militia under General Caswell had already gleaned from the countrysideand would not come in from its private skirmishes and join forces with de Kalb as it was expected to do . Then in the middle of July news came to the Deep River camp . GeneralGates had been appointed by Congress to lead the Army of the South against Cornwallis , and was now on his way to take command . To de Kalb , who had no petty ambition and felt his responsibilities keenly , it came as something of a relief to know that now he could turn them over to a superior officer . To the men , the appointment of the showy victor of Saratoga held out some promise of better communications , increased supplies , a new lease on life . But to Julian it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered greatly and endured almost unbearableprivations , but always with the knowledge that their commanding officer shared their discomforts and was doing the best any general in his circumstances could do . They had confidence in de Kalb as a soldier , and affection for him as a man . But Julian remembered St. John 's rude laughter at the time of Burgoyne 's surrender  --  Gates was a summer soldier , hanging round Congress  --  Schuyler had done all the work beforeSaratoga  --  and now de Kalb had borne the brunt of the march through Carolina . How had Gates got in again ? Julian noticed that Neddy too sat silent among the hopeful speculationsof the Sixth Maryland that night . Their eyes met , and Neddy shook his head . " Do n't do any harm to perk up their spirits some , " he muttered . " But I 'd sooner keep to the Baron . This ai n't fair on the Baron , he has n't had a dog 's chance so far . Gates will come swelling into camp , maybe with wagons behind him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all let out their belts a notch and licker up and Gates will be a hero . The Baron has brought us this far . Why do n't they send him more men and rationsand wagons , instead of another general ? We do n't need Gates , " Neddy summed it up querulously with a glance over his shoulder at his optimistic comrades . " All we need is what any self-respectin ' army needs  --  something in our stummicks that will stick to our ribs , and something to carry our baggage  --  and maybe some more artillery . And all they send us is Gates ! " There were no wagons behind Gates , and consequently there was no rum . He was full of assurances , however , exuding self-importance and creating enormous bustle . The camp was somewhat hypnotized by this impression of big things just ahead . But their brief enlivenment vanished in blank astonishment when his first orders contained the announcement that they must expect to march direct for Camden at a moment 's notice . March on what ? They had been served with half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet they were to move forward . Julian was less surprised than most of them , but he wondered at the acquiescence of experienced officers like de Kalb and Gist and the adjtant , Williams , in so crack-brained a course . He had no way of knowingabout the paralyzing over-confidence of the new broom , which left Gates ' subordinates speechless and shrugging their shoulders in bewilderedresignation . No man could be so wilfully wrong as Gates seemed to be . There must really be something in his loud reiterated promises of wagons loaded with rum and supplies which were to overtakethem at any minute  --  had he not been , he demanded , in touch with the State legislature ? The noon day halt on the first day 's march consumed the scraps which remained in the soldiers ' knapsacks . For two more days they marched southward past empty houses and deserted fields , through devastating heat and blinding thunderstorms . The terrain got worse as they went , and no supplies arrived from the rear . The men , already weak , were . staggering in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few overloadedwagons which were left . Still deprived of the soldier 's onlyp179luxuries , rum and tobacco , the dark , scowling ranks had finally begun to straggle dangerously , to plunder and to steal . Julian stumbled forward at Neddy 's side in a nagging nightmare of being left behind in the wilderness which had at last engulfed him . By now they had come to the pine barrens , vast tracts of sandy waste alternatingwith swampy areas , where the crowding trees made twilight of high noon and a murmuring wind was never still ; and at night the frogs ' shrill clamor gnawed at nerves already ragged from the unceasingcamp noises of coughing , groaning , belching , cursing men lost to the last decencies in their fatigue and misery . But for Julian there could be no surcease from the disgusting proximity of his wretched comrades , for he knew that in solitude lay oblivion and he was ridden by that dread of being left behind ... . From the Carolina militia , who knew the vicinity , a widening ripple of apprehension and dissatisfaction was spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was Neddy Blake . The Carolinianssaid they were on the wrong road . True , it was the most direct route to Camden , but it led through the endless barrens , already stripped of sustenance by the inhabitants who had starved out and fled , leaving derelict farms and even abandoning livestock . There were wild watercourseshere which a few hours ' rain turned into raging torrents impossible to cross even if there had been ferries , which there were not in most places . Somebody ought to tell Gates , they said , that there was another route to Camden , longer but much preferable , via Salisbury and Charlotte , which lay through a fertile country , where a road to Virginia could be kept open to the rear in a friendly Whig population , and where hospitals and workshops and magazines could be safely established  --  and from which the British outpost at Lynch 's Creek in front of Camdenmight be flanked . Neddy put it in a nutshell . In a countryside like this one , said Neddy , a forlorn hope of caterpillars must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luckily , that somebody had told Gates . Colonel Williams , as an old acquaintance rather than a subordinateofficer , had undertaken to remonstrate . But recommendations carefully drawn up in writing and signed by the chief officers of the General 's command were ignored by Gates , and the marching order stood unchanged for the most direct route which he himself had hit upon after a summary survey of the inadequate maps spread out and spilling untidily over the edges of the camp table in his tent . Gates asked for no advice and he took none . Encouraging word went out through the tottering ranks that the fertile regions of the Peedee banks ahead would provide corn from the new crop . They came to the Peedee and found the corn , far from ripe but sweet and tender . There was no bread . The men boiled the green ears with the lean beef and tough pork they foraged day by day , and ate it without salt . They found green peaches and ate those . The results , of course , were disastrous , for colic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck to a tasteless soup made of the stringy meat and thickened with their hair powder , and remained in somewhat better health . They came one evening to May 's Mill , where they had been promised reinforcements and flour , and they found as usual nothing . When the sunset drums had beat the retreat and the roll had been called , Julian lay where he had dropped , half dead with hunger and sickness , blind and deaf to the feeble attempts to make a camp and build fires , over which there was almost nothing to cook , which went on around him . This was worse than anything they had experienced under de Kalb 's leadership . For this there was no remedy but to lie still and die . His feet were a mass of sore and running blisters gritty with dirt , his beard was days old , his shirt hung in sweat-drenched , ground-stained ribbons , his hands were filthy and torn , with split black nails . There had been no opportunity or strength to wash , much less to shave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a clod among clods , and except for his aching bones and racked insides , dust returning to dust . Neddy knelt down beside him , speaking repellent words of encouragementand false reassurance . Neddy 's hand gripped him , rolled him over on his back . Julian raised a crooked elbow to hide his face from the sky and moaned . " Pst ! " said Neddy in his ear . " Here comes the colonel . Pull up , lad , do n't let him find us like this ! " Colonel Williams , who commanded the Sixth when not acting as adjutant , passed slowly among his men that evening , looking as gaunt and ill as any of them , but trying with a well-placed word here and there to avert a rising mutiny with which he could feel only sympathy . To a group which muttered about food he showed his own empty mess/case and canteen with a smile . When he came to a boy who blubbered from pain and homesickness , he paused to lay a hand on the nearly naked shoulder with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking down at the guardian scarecrow who crouched beside his motionless friend . " Ah , Blake , " he said , for everyone in the Sixth seemed to know Neddy by name . " Glad to see you 're still with us ! Anything I can do here ? " " He ai n't used to it , sir , " Neddy explained apologetically . " His feet has gone bad  --  he 's got guts , all right , but he just ai n't used to it . Eddicatedman , sir , " he added confidentially . Williams bent and laid hold of Julian 's shielding arm , and Julian tried instinctively , without opening his eyes , to turn his face into the ground . " I 've took a sort of fancy to him , sir , " Neddy went on sheepishly . " B'God I had to show him how to fire a musket when he first come in , back at Petersburg ! He ketches on , though . He 's hell-bent to be a soldier ! " " Had anything at all to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . " " Some corn has been brought in to the mill . It 's God 's truth , Blake , they are grinding it now . There will be an issue of bread tonight , and something in the morning as well . See that your friend gets his share , wo n't you  --  he 's not fit to look after himself . " The colonel straightened , and passed on through the groups of sullen , lounging men . May 's Mill thus proved to be heartening , and a night 's sodden slumberwith a comforted stomach which at last had been given something to gnaw on restored Julian a little . There seemed to be no longer any fired design in anyone 's mind as to the objective , or even a hazy notion of what would be the outcome of the fantastic march on Camden  --  just a monotonous slogging forward towards an enemy whose strength was unknown and whose position might be almost anywhere . Caswell did come in at last , scared in by a skirmish with a British outpost ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August fourteenth when Gates was at Clermont within a day 's march of Camden . The army was still living from hand to mouth , and Stevens brought nothing much in the way of supplies except a stock of West Indies molasses . Somebody had a brilliant idea  --  and the molasses was issued to the troops as a treat in place of the rum which had never arrived . It went down on top of the green fruit and scorched bread made from green corn , and most of the army spent most of the night in the bushes . With Stevens was a tired , road-stained courier who had come all the way from Washington 's headquarters in New Jersey , carrying private letters from the Commander-in-Chief for Gates and de Kalb , and commissionedto make a confidential report to His Excellency on the situationas he found it  --  for it was no secret any more that Congress had appointed Gates , its favorite , without even consulting Washington , who had intended Greene for the southern command . So that when Major St. John Sprague rode into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his saddlebags he was not altogether surprised , though none the less horrified , at what he encounteredthere . It was a heartrending hour St. John spent with his friend de Kalb the same evening , bent over a map on the rough camp table in the big German 's tent , tracing by the light of a single candle stuck in the neck of a bottle the route Gates should have taken from Hillsborough , to prevent Rawdon 's comfortable withdrawal of his Lynch 's Creek outpostsand to take his supplies . But it was too late now . Even while they discussed in low tones the highly unsatisfactory prospect before them , the summons came to a council of war . What a granny-looking fellow it is anyway , St. John found himself thinking as the staff grouped themselves rather silently around Gates in the lantern light , and he could not but compare Washington 's austere efficiency with the opaque urbanity of Gates . The plan of advance and battle at Camden was all Gates ' own , and it was laid down now as an established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Kalb had the tenacity to raise his voice in objection . But Gates had no use for objections . So long as his subordinates maintained a silence which could be construed as consent , he did not care what they were thinking . As the meeting adjourned , Colonel Williams remarked that he would give a good deal to know where he would be dining the dayp183after tomorrow . Gates rounded on him , all bluff and confidence . " Dine , sir ? Where but in Camden , with Lord Rawdon as our guest ! " With de Kalb 's heavy hand resting on his arm , and the young French aide du Buysson walking on the Baron 's other side , St. John accompanied the old general back to the tent where the map still waited under the guttering candle , and the three of them looked at each other a long moment , beyond speech . At last de Kalb , seated creakingly on his narrowcamp bed , motioned his juniors to stools beside the table " Even if we live to tell it , " said de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He plans an elaborate night surprise , to be executed by exhausted troops like these , and half of them raw militia ! And then , to take a British stronghold like Camden unawares , he puts at the head of his column a mounted legion under our friend Armand  --  ! " He wagged his great head wearily , he tried to smile . " It is genius , " he admittedgenerously . " He has a genius to do the wrong thing ! " " Thank God I arrived here when I did ! " said St. John . " I 've seen enough to clear you , sir  --  no matter what happens ! I shall go to Congress myself ! I shall ask to make my report in person  --  " " Na , na , " de Kalb interrupted him with a large vague gesture of a large fat hand . " Congress ? Fah ! Who fights this war ? Washington ! I do not like for General Washington to think I am a numskull . That is all that matters . You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was some sort of altercation outside the tent , du Buysson sprang to his feet , and Colonel Armand appeared at the flap , a gaunt , excitable man , white with anger . The sentry 's anxious face showed over his shoulder , and du Buysson waved it away as Armand burst into agitated speech . " Sir  --  mon general  --  I beg your indulgence  --  but I must speak with you ! The order of march  --  my legion to head the column  --  sir , it is not possible ! " De Kalb gave his massive French shrug , his rueful , enchanting smile . " It is in the orders , Colonel Armand . " " But it is all contrary to military tactics  --  a child playing with his wooden soldiers on the nursery floor would not conceive it  --  it is to say imbecile ! " cried Armand , quite beside himself . " Regardez , mon general  --  je ne sais pas ou j'en Buis ! An army , warned to silence on pain of death  --  sous peine de mort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not speak , they must not cough , mordieu , they must not sneeze !  --  but they are to be led on this fantastique venture , through the dark , on an unfamiliar road which runs across a swamp  --  by cavalry ! " " I have just said to du Buysson and the Major here , how no one will ever believe it , " remarked de Kalb , with what seemed like satisfaction that his views were corroborated . " No one will live to tell it ! " shrieked Armand . " My words exactly , " de Kalb nodded , and glanced with twinkling triumph at St. John Sprague . " He has done it on purpose  --  a quoi bon ? " Armand flung out thin , soiled hands which shook in the candlelight . " He has done it to see me wiped out ! He does not believe in cavalry  --  he does not like me , he never did ! Pas vrai ! I know that  --  it is a personal spite , he wants to be rid of me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , na , " said de Kalb soothingly . " It is no time for spite , in the middle of a war . " " I will not do it ! " wailed Armand , and his unsteady hands went to his face . " It is certain death  --  it is to deliver my men to massacre  --  I will not march  --  ! " He rocked in the candlelight . " It is in your orders , " said de Kalb , and his voice hardened . " I am not in command now . It is no good coming to me . " " But if you only would speak to him , mon general  --  " " I spoke . You heard . " " If you only would try again , sir  --  now , before it is too late  --  " " I can do nothing , " said de Kalb , suddenly stony . " That is all , Colonel Armand . Good night . " " But cavalry  --  to lead a surprise attack  --  ! " " Dismissed , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands before his face . There was a silence then , in the flickering light , with the sentry 's tread outside . " En fin , our ! " exploded du Buysson finally . " God knows it is a bad businessall round  --  but Armand has no better discipline of himself than ofhis unfortunate men ! Well , I do not envy him his post , I confess ! " St. John raised his eyes from contemplation of his boots and found , de Kalb 's knowing , almost roguish look fixed on him.  | " Major Sprague , you have arrived in time to act with du Buysson as my aide in this  --  emergency , " said the Baron . " If you think His Excellencywould permit  --  ? " " I should be honored , sir , " St. John replied simply , and they drew together over the map without further waste of time , to discuss alleviatingstrategies . The Sixth Maryland was in the Second Brigade , which was posted to follow the First , which came immediately behind Armand 's Legion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Light Infantry flanking him in Indian file . Behind the Marylands were the Carolina and Virginia militia and the artillery . Neddy said the militia always wavered when their officers were killed , instead of going in to avenge them the way veterans would . And after every skirmish the militia always wanted to go home and kiss their girls and tell the news and chuck their weight about , instead of keeping their noses to the grindstone ... . Julian reeled through darkness as sultry as day , grateful for Neddy 's presence at his side even after the curse of silence was imposed upon them . The deep sand dragged at his feet , and there was a dull , nauseatingpain in his middle . He had tried more than once to picture his first entry into battle , but his most gruesome imaginings had never achieved anything quite like this . And it was altogether uncalled-for that one should be obliged to endure a grisly stomach-ache along with one 's baptism of fire . Every now and then he and Neddy jolted together as one of them stumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's musket had long since worn such a sore place on his shoulder that he had fastened a clumsy moss pad inside his coat . The musket went on boring , till it seemed to chafe the bare bone , and at every step the illhungcartouche-box banged his weary thigh . Sand filled his broken boots , sifted through his mended , worn-out stockings , and made agonizinggrit between his toes . In his nostrils was the now familiar stench of hot , unwashed , sickly men , and the sweating horses of the officers . The sand deadened footfalls as the army moved forward without drum or bugle to cheer their courage . Talk was forbidden , but still there were sounds , under the high bright southern stars  --  the sound of a retching man unable to suppress a groan and a curse ; the soundp186of a man who tripped over a root or stone and fell and could not rise again and did not care ; the clink of bit and spur and sabre as an officer eased his horse along the line with now and then a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across a clearing ; and always the slug , slut , slug of weary marching feet which Julian felt would follow him beyond the grave . The thick southern night made its own sounds too  --  great frogs bellowed from the swamp either side of the road , unseenthings crashed and slithered from under the men 's very feet , insectshummed and blundered in their faces , outraged night birds fled screaming through the trees overhead . After about four hours of this a burst of firing up in front rent the night . " What 's that ? " said Julian , jerked from a walking stupor , and felt his queasy stomach turn within him . " Scouting party , mebbe , " said Neddy , sounding very calm . " Or mebbe mounted pickets . " A sharp order to halt and be silent ran back along the line , but the drums broke fiercely into the long roll , sounding the alarm . They waited , leaning against each other , listening to what seemed to be an impromptu battle raging just ahead . Gun flashes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drums and bugles and shouted commands . " They 've got Armand treed , sure as you 're a foot high , " said Neddy wisely . " Yep  --  I told you  --  here it comes  --  b'God , it sounds as though we 'd flushed the whole damned British army ! " To his increasingly blasphemous astonishment , Neddy proved to have guessed right . By a monumental coincidence , the British army had been set in motion from Camden at the same hour of the same night , with the same objective  --  surprise attack . It met the Continental force head on , about two o'clock in the morning , where the road ran along a narrowrise between two swamps in the pine forest . Some of Armand 's troopers , wounded , or shattered by shock , fled helter skelter to the rear , panicking the First Maryland Brigade and spreading terror as they went . The men on the flanks stood firm , and the British , taken no less unawares , soon fell back . As though by mutual consent the shooting ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From prisoners taken in the skirmish Gates learned to his undisguisedp187amazement that Cornwallis himself had arrived from Charleston only the day before and was leading the British in person , and that Tarleton'sformidable green-clad dragoons had also joined the Camden garrison . Stuttering with self-justification and expletives , Gates called a hasty council . Of the weary , disillusioned men who gathered round him only de Kalb stood out stoutly for retreat under cover of darkness , and Gates ' attitude towards the old warrior carried an open slur on de Kalb 's personal courage . St. John would have flared up at that , but was checked by the weight of de Kalb 's hand on his arm . Stevens of Virginia blurted that it was too late now to do anything but fight , and Gates hastily agreed with him , because , he pointed out , to turn back now would look like flight . So the order to posts was given . The incapacitated , the camp followers , and the heavy baggage were ordered to the rear along the road which ran to Charlotte . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatalistic shrugs , and the battle lines were drawn before dawn . On the brink of his first engagement Julian was fortunate in being among veteran troops , for it was a severe trial on the nerves to find your battle stations in darkness and then wait there in your tracks for daylight , and the militia companies suffered acutely from the shakes . Julian sat on the damp ground beside Neddy , his musket across his drawn-up knees . The frogs were still noisy above the smothered sounds of the fumbling army , and fireflies flitted like lanterns everywhere . Although everyone dripped perspiration in the heavy , stinking air of the swampland , Julian 's hands were cold and unsteady , and his heart hammered in his ears . He tried to tell himself that it was physical weakness from the bad food and the endless dysentery , but he knew it was mostly fear ; fear of the wilderness he had come to on this frightfulmarch , leaving behind him the merest decencies of life , till hunger became a bestial thing and the will to survive was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadfast enemy they had come up with tt last , doubly dreadful in the shrouding dark , making at this moment its own professional disposition of its forces ; fear of the first gray streak of a day which might be his last , or worse , might leave him maimed and better dead ; fear of his own fear , which at some crucial moment nni ; ; ht show in his behavior so that he would disgrace himself under lire . He was starving and sick and less than half himself , and he knew that he was afraid to fight , and he despised himself accordingly , and felt Neddy 's arm laid hard across his shoulders . " Bear up , lad , " said Neddy in his ear . " They make a lot of noise comin ' in , and they look something fierce , but they can bleed under those red coats , same as the rest of us ! " As daylight came , it could be seen that the lines were very close , and that the position would give the advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marshy land . The Sixth Maryland was on the right wing , which Gist and de Kalb commanded . Caswell 's tardy militia had the center , across the road , and Stevens ' Virginia brigade was on the left . Smallwood 's First Brigade of Marylanders , pulling themselves together after Armand 's disaster , were held in reserve , behind the artillery . Long before the sun was visible the British drums were heard beating to arms , and as the American drums hastily replied de Kalb rode down through the purple haze and took up his position , running a raking blue eye along the lines so that each man straightened himself instinctively to meet it . The Sixth Maryland were ready  --  they were veterans of the northern campaign , they knew what was coming and how to meet it . Julian 's smarting , sleepless eyes slid without recognition over the officer who rode beside du Buysson and fastened themselves on the calm , massive figure of the Baron astride the big horse , and he felt his lurching heart steady itself so that the drums no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his sensations of sheer sickness abated somewhat . Gates , he noticed , was nowhere to be seen . An aide from Colonel Williams cantered in to say that the enemy were deploying by the right and that Colonel Williams had advised Stevens to attack them at once in hopes of catching them on one foot . Before he had finished speaking , the first British volley crashed in . Stevens was too late . Smoke drifted low on the hot , still air . The battle had begun . Dry-throated , with the taste of powder already on his tongue , Julian saw to his priming and awaited the order to fire . De Kalb 's voice rang out over his shabby ranks as unhurried as though on the parade-ground , while the whole British line moved in on them , the red coats showing dark through the muffling haze . " Cock firelock ! " The order echoed from officer to officer towards him , and Julian 's fingers as he obeyedp189were clumsy and damp . " Make rrready !  --  Take aim ! " And he mutteredto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " FIRE ! " But the British received the volley and came on , noisily , under the order to charge bayonet , during those naked , frantic moments when even an experienced man must fumble with cartouche-box and ramrod in the effort to re-load in time . " Handle carrrtridge ! " Yes , all right , snatch the cartridge from the pouch  --  bite off the top  --  faugh , you 're bound to get the stuff in your mouth- " PRRRIME ! "  --  give us time , ca n't you , got to shake some powder into the pan now , do n't spill it all , lummox  --  " Shut pan ! "  --  shut it is , too , and no wind to blow the powder into your eyes today , thank God , but do n't let 's drip sweat into it , that would be worse  --  " Charrrge with cartridge ! "  --  hurry up , powder down the barrel , that 's the stuff  --  shaking like a leaf , you are , but hell , so are the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! "  --  oh , Lord , I nearly forgot that , blow my own head off in a minute  --  " Rrreturn rrrammers ! "  --  you 're absolutely right , sir , must n't lose the bloody rammer , leave us in a pretty fix  --  God , why ca n't they make a gun you can fire more than once without going through all these motions  --  " Cock firelock !  --  Make rrready !  --  Take aim ! "  --  all right , here we go again  --  listen to those redcoats yell  --  yes , I 'm all right , Neddy , only it 's so damned slow and so many things to think of  --  has he forgotten the next word ?  --  " FIRE ! " It was a lively corner of hell the Sixth Maryland occupied that day . The smoke would not rise on the dank air , and it was therefore impossible to see the effect of the gunfire on either side , except that it was plain that nothing stopped the British . Now the artillery of both armies was playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the rattle of drums beating the long roll and the sharp sweet notes of the bugles . Du Buysson dashed in on a wounded horse to say that Caswell'smilitia would not stand much longer , and Stevens ' men were crumbling under the first British onslaught , and that Singleton 's artilleryhad had to retire from the road . Then Colonel Williams arrived , his horse white with lather , to tell de Kalb that Gates was behind the reserves giving no orders at all , and the whereabouts of General Smallwood , in command of the reserves , were unknown to his officers , who had not seen him since the battle started and who desired to know the Baron 's wishes.  | With his own brigade firm as a rock at his back , de Kalb ordered Williams to go and bring up Smallwood 's men to hold back the British right . And then he actually began to push forward with his own men , step by step , in lively hand-to-hand fighting , his cheery orders still coming with the rhythmic precision of the parade ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we ai n't doin ' so bad ! " crowed Neddy , the joy of battle on him . " The Carolina militia always runs , but if those bastards from Virginia , beggin ' your pardon , laddie , will only stand up to it a little longer  --  wheee , you would , would you , bloody-back , and be damned to you !  --  come on , lad , the Baron 's down ! Come on , you club-footed , ham-strung sons-o ' - bitches , the Baron 's lost his horse  --  ! " By the time they reached him , the Baron was up on his feet . He had received a sword-cut on the head while he was entangled beneath his horse , and du Buysson was binding his own sash around the wound and imploring him to retire from the field . De Kalb brushed him aside and led a bayonet charge on foot over heaps of slain , and took fifty kilted prisoners from the British Seventy-first , which was a Highlandlight infantry regiment . Julian was among the men in a cordon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bellowing with berserk courage , his hat gone , his silver hair untied and hanging beneath the startling scarlet sashbandagewhich swathed his head like a turban . The excitement of the charge , the savage , grunting , successful use of his bayonet which had saved his own life twice over , and a breathing space in which to realize that he was still alive , had made a soldier out of the schoolmaster . Blood was running down his left arm in a sticky stream , and Neddy made him take off his coat and fashioned a rough bandage from his torn-off shirt sleeve before the fight engulfed them again . Julian felt no pain now , and no more fear . It was necessary only to keep de Kalb in sight , though you could hardly see beyond the length of your own musket in the powder-smoke and haze , with the sweat in your eyes , nor tell friend from foe until it was almost too late . His cartridges were all gone , and through sheer necessity he had mastered the old soldier 's trick of priming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spitting balls down the barrel , from a supply held in his cheek . Even through the smoke and confusion it was plain evenp191to a novice that the Sixth 's casualties were climbing . " B'God , they 're thinning us ! " cried Neddy angrily . " It 's comin ' from the left , those varmints are n't coverin ' us , laddie , what kind of an army is this ! 0-ho , you with the silver buttons , how d' ya like it , eh ? " There was no answer as his bayonet got home . Just as the British might have wavered and the tide of battle hung , another aide on horseback catapulted in among them calling on de Kalb . " Colonel Williams says the First Brigade can not hold much longer , sir  --  Stevens ' men have taken to the swamp , and when the First gives way , Cornwallis will turn your flank  --  for God 's sake fall back , sir , you 'll have the whole British army against your left  --  ! " " Tell Williams he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cornwallis yet ! Push the cannon ahead , I do not hear our artillery , where is Singleton ? Tell Williams it will only be minutes now , till we can begin to throw them back  --  " The aide was staring past de Kalb at a bloodstained , coatless , dishevelledfigure with the infantryman 's black powder smear across its mouth . " Julian ! " cried St. John incredulously . " Julian , for the love of God  --  ! " And Julian after one quick glance upwards swung his musket buttendfirst at the Highlander 's bayonet launched full tilt out of the haze at St. John 's back . It took him off balance and he fell with the red coat on top of him , and they rolled against the feet of St. John 's horse . St. John , unscratched , fired his pistol point-blank and leaped from the saddleto lay hands on the dead weight pinning Julian down , but de Kalb seized and shook him , bellowing above the musket-fire " Get back to Williams , do you hear  --  tell Williams to rally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flung himself at the Baron from behind , his voice barely audible in the noise of furious fighting all around them . " We ca n't do it , sir  --  they 've flanked us and they 're sending the cavalry at us  --  Armand is nowhere  --  we ca n't do it , the Greens are coming in ! " But the mighty de Kalb , streaming with blood , hauled St. John up from his knees and threw him bodily against the saddle . " God damn you , Major , will you ride ? Tell Gist to hold fast and tellp192Williams to close up the left and support me with Gist ! It 's only Tarletonand his cutthroats ! Front rank bayonets , rear rank fire ! You know how cavalry hates bayonets ! RIDE ! " A ball caught him in the lung and he sagged coughing into du Buysson'sarms , while St. John turned his back on Julian where he lay , and galloped away towards Smallwood 's deserted post where Williams was now in command . Behind him he could hear the thunder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuddered away from the things he had seen before now in the wake of a cavalry charge . At the same time exquisite pain lodged in his right knee and his horse stumbled , but kept on going , and the silver music of Tarleton 's bugles pursued him like delirium . Further weakened now by loss of blood , Julian was struggling to free himself from the scarlet-clad body which St. John had not had time to drag away . On all sides of him frantic officers laid the flat of their swords to infantrymen who fled like leaves before the wind , and the ground beneath him shivered long before with a roar the charge burst above him in a clanking maelstrom of iron-shod hooves and flailingsabres and spurs and the blood-chilling British huzzah  --  so that he fell back and lay still where he was , grateful now for the shield of his dead enemy . Even over the rattle and pound and din of the charge he could hear du Buysson 's frenzied cry : " It 's the Baron de Kalb ! In God 's name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicked dirt into Julian 's eyes and struck with a sickeningjar on the body beneath which he lay huddled . Then the death scream of a horse shrilled above the battle sounds , and the animal came down heavily in its tracks , its head and shoulders across the legs of the dead Highlander , its rider thrown on top of the heap . Dazed by the impact and gasping for breath under the inert , smothering weight , Julian lay and felt warm blood soaking his legs and could only guess because he had no new pain that it was not his own . Finally , leaving behind it what seemed an echoing quiet , the charge had passed over him and he was still alive . Giddily he fought his way to a sitting position , elbowing away the two dead men who had shielded him , and wiped the dirt and sweat from his eyes . Near him on the ground lay de Kalb , with du Buysson spreadeagledface down on top of him as he had thrown himself to protectp193his helpless commander . There were sabre cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised himself slowly to his knees and bent above de Kalb , loosening the Baron 's cravat with dexterous , gentle fingers . Julian picked up the canteen which was attached to the dead dragoon 's belt and shook it , and it gave a pleasant gurgle . He detached it , disentangledhis legs from the horse and the Highlander , and found them sore but whole . He crawled painfully on his hands and knees towards du Buysson . " Here 's some water , " he said . " Is he still alive ? " " Yes  --  he is alive . " Du Buysson raised de Kalb 's head in his arms , unmindful of his own wounds . The bulky sash-bandage had been torn off and the Baron 's white hair was stained with his blood . " Can you get a little water between his teeth ? " Together they worked over the prostrate giant , trying to stanch his wounds , using the precious water drop by drop , while the battle raged a few hundred yards beyond them , with spent balls dropping near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the brutal August sun burned away the cloaking mist . The Baron writhed under their hands and muttered something . " It is the name of his wife , " said du Buysson . " Always he thinks of her  --  mon general  --  courage , mon general , c'est du Buysson ici  --  soyez : runquille , c'est du Buysson  --  toujours  --  " Tears were running down his face through the powder stains . Julian looked about for Neddy , suddenly fearful of what he might see . The ground was strewn with the bodies of men of both armies , some of which moved , or tried to , some of which were no longer human forms . Baggage and precious equipment abandoned in flight littered the trampled earth . Horses lay kicking and thrashing in death throes or still cantered aimlessly with empty saddles till they dropped of wounds or exhaustion . And now that the noise of battle was more distant , other sounds were audible  --  hideous sounds of agony and terror , the long , awful wail of the wounded and the shrieks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the brassy sky above , silent , watchful , waiting , hovered the black shapes of the turkey-buzzards . For a few moments Julian sat staring through the receding battle haze , wondering why he did not react emotionally to the horrors all around him ; astonished at his own veteran calm . Well , there it was , he had fought his first battle , and he had n't been afraid , except just at first , and he had n't done so badly , either , and though his wound still bled he was alive , by a miracle , alive  --  Then , without warning a cold wave of nausea rose within him , and the world turned black and blurry and he slewed around just in time and gave up everything but his immortal soul on the ground , retching , blind , and bereft of dignity ; emerging spent and chastened in his hasty pride , and very much aware of the mangled horse near by , from which rose a mighty stench to rival the lesser smells of swamp and gunpowder . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat up slowly , wiping at a cut in his scalp with the tail of his shirt . Julian recognized the inspired flow of language almost before he saw the man . " Neddy ! " he cried in relief . " Neddy , thank God ! " Neddy pivoted on his seat , his vague gaze found and focused on the man he had taken a fancy to , and his wicked , leering smile broke crookedly . " Hullo , laddie ! The lobsters cut me wide open ! Would you give me the loan of your shirt to tie it up with ? Or no  --  b'God , I 'll use this one here ! " He began to rifle the body of the Highlander St. John had shot . " Take it easy , I 'll help you , " said Julian , crawling towards him , and together they tore off the white linen shirt in strips and made Neddy a tidy bandage . Before they had quite finished , Neddy 's gaze sharpened on the middle distance , and his grin widened to a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's come amongst us ! " he marvelled . A group of mounted British officers was bearing down on them briskly across the terrible field , white wigs and scarlet coats and white doeskin breeches all very handsome , the silver half-moons of the polished gorgets above their lace jabots reflecting a blinding glare . " It 's  --  it must be Cornwallis himself , " said Julian stupidly , and saw du Buysson stagger to his feet to face them . " The Baron de Kalb is severely wounded , sir , " said du Buysson , and swayed in his tracks as Cornwallis reined up above him . " I implore you to give him proper care at once by your surgeons . " " Why , yes , it shall be done , " said Cornwallis , taking in the situation with maddening deliberation , and his high conqueror 's glance ran on to include the bloodstained pair on the ground beyond , who gazed up at him rather spellbound . " I am sorry to hear of the Baron 's  --  misfor/tune , " said Cornwallis courteously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are all my prisoners . " Gates was " carried away , " as he afterwards put it , from his strong position in the rear , by the flight of the militia . He was mounted on a fleet Virginia horse which brought him to Charlotte by nightfall , a distance of some sixty miles . Caswell somehow contrived to keep up with him . Armand 's corps disgraced themselves by looting the abandonedbaggage of their own side . Gates had arranged no rendezvous in the event of a retreat , but Gist , Smallwood , Armand , and a few other officers besides the faithful Williams , found their way to the city , only to learn that Gates had already departed on a fresh horse for Hillsborough . What was left of the veteran companies who had escaped death or capture by taking to the swamps straggled to Hillsborough after him . They were ragged and beaten and hungry , but Gates was all the commander they had , so they rallied to him . The militia had broken too soon , and the Continentals had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by capture at Charleston , and another by annihilation at Camden . It looked now very much as though they had finally lost the war , and there was dismay and despair in the Carolinas . Cornwallis removed his wounded and prisoners into Camden , where de Kalb died of eleven wounds . Du Buysson 's were not fatal . Julian and Neddy Blake received a surgeon 's care , and were pronounced fit to set off with a hundred and forty-eight others under a strong guard along the hot swampy road for Charleston and the wretched prospect of a British prison ship . The road they travelled was often only a narrow log causeway runningthrough vine-laced undergrowth at the edge of stagnant brown water . Towering cypress and gum trees bearded with gray moss made what would have been welcome shade if they had not also cut off every breath of air . Mosquitoes swarmed , and slimy furtive things slipped into the water with little whispering sounds on every side , and a man from Delaware died hideously of snakebite . As a walking wounded case , Julian plodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fresh dressings , and hour by hour he felt the threatening fever rising in his blood . They were better fed by the British than they had been for days , but weakness gained upon him , and he lost track of time in the moss-hung twilight of the swamps . The Wateree became the Santee , which must be crossed to come to Charleston , and the hurry-up order was passed along the line so as to make use of the ferry before nightfall . But they were too late after all , and rather than divide his party the British officer in charge decided to bivouac for the night on the near bank . At the halt , Julian dropped in his tracks on the muddy ground , past caring to secure one of the evil-smelling blankets which were issued at nightfall , and slid into a kind of coma mixed with delirium , in which his old dread of the wilderness returned and magnified and became a fever-nightmare of trees a mile high , snakes the size of a man 's arm , and mammoth disembodied pink-lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , the crowning horror , he heard the long shrill yell of unseen Indians ... . Neddy was shaking him awake to pandemonium in the dawn . The yelling he had heard was Francis Marion 's famous war-whoop as he charged with a flailing sword on sleepy British sentries , followed by his crew of lethal warriors . Horry had brought the news of Gates ' defeat and Marion moved promptly to intercept the British guard with its contingent of prisoners bound for Charleston . Taken entirely by surprise , the guard defended itself fiercely in hand-to-hand fighting , in which the prisoners soon joined with whateverweapons they could lay hold of . Neddy sailed as usual into the thick of it and seized the flying halter of a loose horse which a British sergeant carrying a bayoneted musket was trying to catch and use himself . " Here you are , laddie ! " Neddy called to Julian . " Up on his back , now , and ride like the devil out of here ! I 'll catch me another and be with you in no time  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hung on it , and when it was withdrawn he fell without a sound beneath the horse 's feet , and the sergeant mounted . Still groggy with sleep and fever , Julian hurled himself bodily at the man on the horse , who had no stirrups , and dragged him down and they rolled together on the ground . The musket caught by its sling on a stump and was jerked out of the sergeant 's hand . Julian recovered it by a lucky twist of his body which put him on top of it , fought for it savagely , edged it slowly out from under him , and struggled to his knees still gripping it . The sergeant , exuding a steady stream of army words which wasted his breath , grabbed out his pistol too late . Julian lunged at short range , his body behind it , for his arms had no strength left . The sergeant yelled once and lay still . Julian left the bayonet where it was and crawled to Neddy , and there was nothing that could be done for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobbing for breath in his weakness . Neddy 's eyes came open , and knew him . " Did ya get him ? " he asked faintly . " I got him , " Julian nodded , and Neddy grinned his crooked , canine grin , and died . " You there , on the ground ! Catch hold of this brute if you want him ! " cried a voice from above , and as Julian turned the halter of the sergeant 's horse was flung at him by a man who wheeled his own horse and rode into the fight around the wagons . Julian thought he recognized Harry , whom Marion had left behind as a link between himself and de Kalb . Automatically he mastered the dancing animal , retaining it for his own . The fight was nearly over and the British were in flight , leaving their dead behind them . Some one came and carried Neddy away . Julian started to follow , leading the horse , but a wave of faintness overcamehim and when he rallied again the business of sorting out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the Continentals elected to join Marion 's corps and were given British horses and equipment . Others preferred an escort to the North Carolina border with the chance of getting home or rejoining their old regiments . " And you , my lad  --  what 's your choice ? " It was Horry again , swing ..  | ing his horse up beside where Julian sat holding to his own mount 's mane and fighting dizziness and nausea . " Well , I 'm not much good like this  --  " he got out . " But I 'd like to come with you . " " Glad to have you ! " said Horry kindly . " You 'll be in for some riding yet . But I reckon we can find you a saddle hereabouts . " Some one led the horse finally , while Julian clung to the pommel with both hands , not knowing or caring that he was being carried deeper into the swamp along a track which only Marion 's men could find . Clammy water splashed him to the waist  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmolested ; some one held water to his swollen lips , some one laved his temples and wrists , voices spoke encouragement . At last they laid him in the bottom of a boat , and the smooth motion was heaven after the horse , and the air grew cooler . There was a rustling silence ashore , broken by the grinding of the boat pole against the cypress trunks , and the scrape of the flat bottom along submerged logs . Julian opened . his eyes and lay looking up into the tall trees , which were so dense and so festooned with the gray streamersthat the color of the sky hardly showed through . A wind moved up there which never reached the water level . Over the edge of the low gunwale he could see dark water , reddish in the flecks of sunlight , dimpled by the zigzag patterns of the waterskaters , cut by the sharp triangular wake of swimming snakes . Narrow streams led off , lost and winding , between clay banks . In some places the moss hung so low that it touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible , to wet his undefended face . Over all was the rancid swamp stink . At last the boat 's nose bumped and grounded , and some one jerked it higher . He smelled the smudge-pots of a camp , and some one was urging him to move again . He strove to obey and found his feet under him  --  stepped out into water ankle deep , slipped on the yellow clay of the sloping bank , felt himself falling , felt himself caught and saved by strong , kind hands , and all was darkness and a beautiful oblivion . They had brought him to Snow 's Island in the midst of the Peedee swamp  --  dry , high land , covered with magnificent moss-draped trees ,  |p199a  natural sanctuary for the hunted . There were deep cane-brakes and swamp at the edges of the Island , and patches of Indian corn which were tended by the convalescents . Here Marion had established his secret headquarters , arms depot , and hospital , always strongly garrisoned ; but almost impossible for an outsider to find . Prisoners or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cypress aisles were not confusing enough . He never encumbered himself long with prisoners , they were either paroled or exchanged or  --  the British rumor ran  --  hanged . In securing this fortress Marion had commandeered all the boats in the neighborhood and destroyed all those he did not need . His men had cut away the bridges , preferring unmarked fords , and felled timber across pathways which ran too near . It was a moated keep , with lookoutposts in the tree-towers manned by sleepless riflemen . Invalids , lyingup between forays with sword-cuts or bullet-wounds , policed the place and kept it tidy . The smudge-pots against the mosquitoes were never allowed to go out . There were few tents , but sail-cloth stretched between the trees gave some shelter from the sun and rain . Laurel and jessamine , palmettos and white cup lilies decorated the primitive dooryards . Tall men must dodge at every turn the same hanging moss which cleared Marion 's head . The horses grazed with their saddles on and the bits hung round their necks , their owners ' swords and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay for days , alternating between delirium and stupor . There was no surgeon , and medical care , while painstaking and gentle , was inexpert . Horry insisted that it was a good man and could be pulled through  --  " Dead on his feet , he was , there at the Ferry , " he was fond of saying . " But grabbed himself a redcoat and finished him off as pretty as ever I saw . I 'm bettin ' on that feller , mind you do n't go and lose him now ! " It fascinated these simple woodsmen that in delirium Julian could speak a language other than English  --  with , as it were , his eyes shut . When they discovered that he actually spoke more than one , he became a local curiosity . They would gather in respectful twos and threes under his sail-cloth canopy and try to guess which one it was  --  " That 's French , that is ! "  --  " Was that Greek , or what ? "  --  while the one of their number who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sick man 's face and took a possessive part in the argument . Marion would come and look down at him and shake his head in his non-committal way . " An educated man , " he said to Horry one day , with a sort of awe . " I have sent to Hillsborough for the loan of a surgeon . I wish we knew who he is . " " One of the aides , must be , " said Horry . " He had lost his coat or we might have his rank to go by . I never saw him , though , all the time I was with that outfit . Could have come in at Clermont , maybe  --  " " He is not a foreigner . " " Bless you , no ! But he has sure got the gift of tongues . Listen to that , now , would you ! What do you suppose it means ? " " Omnem crede diem  --  tibi diluxisse supremum  --  " Julian was mutteringnow . " Each day that dawns  --  the last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberis  --  that 's too easy  --  pro aris atque foci 's suis  --  construe , Kit , construe  --  Fallentis semita vitae  --  untrodden paths  --  of life  --  Tibby , forgive me , I am deserting you  --  On n'est jamais si heureux ni si malheureuxqu'on s'imagine , Tibby  --  that 's La Rochfoucauld  --  there on the top shelf  --  third from the left  --  damn , I 've lost Chesterfield and never read it !  --  no time now  --  too late  --  must win the war  --  oh , damn the war  --  on n'est jamais  --  si malheureux  --  " " Who is Tibby , I wonder , " murmured Horry . " Maybe we ought n't to listen any more  --  " Marion turned away silently and they departed from Julian 's side . " If he lives , " said Marion , " we 'll have to send him back up north . " " To Gates ? " Marion snorted . But " He do n't belong here , " he said . " But that feller can fight , " Horry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't lettin ' his friend go to glory without company . That is guts . We can use him . " " He do n't belong here , " said Marion , closing it . A few days after this an excited orderly with a bandage round his head appeared at the flap of Marion 's tent . " Say , General , you 'd better come quick ! He 's makin ' sense ! The fellerp201that talks Greek and all . He 's woke up all there ! They said to fetch you on the run ! " It was a strange , illogical friendship which grew up between himself and Marion during Julian 's long convalescence . Each embodied something for which the other entertained respect amounting to envy . Marion'sadmiration for scholarship and long , straight limbs matched Julian 's schoolboy worship of a born fighting man . They discoursed for hours together , the small , limping , taciturn partisan general and the shy , deep-thinking schoolmaster , and each found in the other 's society an abiding satisfaction . Marion wanted to hear about Europe no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as remote . He spoke with a certain pride of his own Huguenot forebears , and of his one ill-fated West Indian voyage and shipwreck as a boy . Julian could see that here was a man as great in his way as the towering Washington , and strove patiently to get him to reveal himself to a sympathetic listener . He sensed Marion 's immense loneliness in the task he had set himslf , and wondered at the terrific latent power in the solitary little man 's lean frame . Marion on his side was puzzled that so fine a lad , possessing all the conceivable attractions for women , should be so alone in the world , with apparently no one to care what became of him . Each felt the same vague , compassionateimpulse to alleviate the rigors of the other 's existence with the warmth of his own friendship . And in a measure each succeeded . Julian was weeks on the mend , more from the fever than the wound . It was some time before he had the strength even to crawl from his cot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and back again . Meanwhile , the life of the camp went on around him . From here at Snow 's Island , Marion 's men went out in small mobile parties to break up enemy supply trains and prisoner convoys , to ter . rorize the undisciplined Tories and prevent them from organizing . Hisp202scouts were both patrols and spies , picking up prisoners , information , and booty . They hid in treetops above the enemy encampments and carried off tethered horses and drowsy sentries to exhibit as trophies . They had to be superb horsemen , dead shots with a rifle or a fowling piece , firing from the saddle as effectively as from the ground . And they had to have the Indian way of taking their direction from the stars , the sun , the bark of trees , and such natural woodsmen 's guides . There was never any waiting for boats or pontoons , the horses were forced to swim like dogs . Marion left no track behind him , if he could avoid it , and was often vainly hunted for hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more often than they found him . All recruits were taught a strange shrill whistle which could be heard at great distances . His troops consisted of his neighbors and friends and some stray slaves . During the informal councils at which every man squatted on the ground holding his horse 's bridle , Marion consulted his officers frequently , listened politely , and silently reached his own conclusions , which were communicated to them only by his future actions . They watched his cook , and by the food prepared for him each day they forecasthis intentions . His preference was to move at sunset , riding all night , as much as sixty miles , until the enemy 's watch-fires and grass-guards were in sight . He would strike at dawn , on a sudden bugle blast , yelling like an Indian . During these forays he lived on cold roast sweet potatoes and drank cold water , and expected his men to subsist on the same . In camp they had the roast sweet potatoes hot , and hominy , sometimes a dry hoe-cake , rarely some lean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captured it from the British commissariat . If necessary they starved themselves in order to feed their horses . The men were badly clothed in homespun , which gave little warmth in the damp swamp nights unless eked out with captured British uniforms . They often slept on the ground without blankets , and there was a long time that Marion himself did not own a blanket , having lost the only one he had in a fire . Their equipment was so scanty in the beginning that they had raided sawmills for saws for their forest blacksmiths to convert into swords and bayonets . A new recruit still often had to accompany a foray unarmed and provide himself with the weapon belonging to the first victim of his comrades ' fire . They rarely numbered more than sixty at a time , andp203they often attacked with only three rounds of ammunition apiece , expectingby the time it was gone to have searched the cartouche-boxes of the dead and wounded for more . Sometimes even buck shot was scarce and they used swan shot , which would not kill . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swamp-fox would not come out and fight like a Christian . His steadfast rule was always to know his enemy 's strength and positionsahead of his attack , which was often ambush and always surprise . Once the noise made by his horses crossing a wooden bridge had given the alarm , and thereafter the men were required to dismount and spread their blankets on the boards before taking their horses over a bridge . He taught them to make themselves invisible , like Indians . " Take trees ! " was a routine order . And " No quarter for Tories ! " and " Mark the epaulet men ! "  --  meaning Get the officers  --  were often heard , as battle cries . Also he taught them to retire slowly when pressed , re-load under cover , and try a second fire . He was not humiliated or angry when his meagre forces retreated discreetly before the British bayonets . He expectedthem to retreat in a pinch . But not too far . He would disappear from camp for days at a time , with a few followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three men . He would be greeted with satisfaction by those who had remained on the Island , and when he had retired to his tent the rest would gather round for stories of the raid  --  stories to which Julian listened enthralled . It got to be a recognized part of the business of each raid , to bring back a story for Mr. Day , which would be duly recounted at his bedside with colorful embroideries and interruptions and slapping of thighs and raucous laughter  --  how one of the five James brothers had scattered a Tory troop singlehanded by shouting over his shoulder as he charged them alone , " Come on , boys , here they are ! " ; how in a Georgetown night raid they had carried off a British general without his breeches and considerately returned him on parole ; how MacDonald had thrust his bayonet into a British back so that it stayed there , and the redcoat had galloped off at full speed , and now  --  heh , heh , heh !  --  MacDonald was without a tarnation good bayonet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was subject to a stammer at moments of great excitement , could not get out the order to Fire and in desperation yelled , " Shoot , damn you , shoot ! "   Sometimes pathetic refugees from a plundered countryside , their homes burned over their heads by marauding Tory bands , were picked up half starving by a scout and brought in to the sanctuary at Snow 's Island which they were trying to find and could not . Marion would give them a meal of roast sweet potatoes and an escort to some more permanent haven . Once a British officer from Charleston , under a white flag , was guided in blindfolded to negotiate an exchange of prisoners . His escort contrived to let him step into swamp water above his shiny black spatterdashesas they helped him out of the boat , and led him with loud expressions of regret under the moss festoons into Marion 's presence before they removed the blindfold . All the British officers seemed to be big men , and Captain Verney loomed enormous above the slight , limpingfigure which advanced to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their business was concluded . Julian answeredthe mess call along with Horry and three or four others who dined in Marion 's company , in time to hear Captain Verney from Charleston accept an invitation to the meal . There was no dining table . They sat about informally on log seats under a stretched sail-cloth in a ring of smudge-pots . Marion was a brigadier-general now , but he dressed no differently and required no more punctilio of his men than before . The young British captain looked around him in some wonderment at the lean , rough-clad men , slouching at ease under the moss-beards , their rifles and sabres standing carelessly to hand against tree trunks or dangling overhead , their grazing horses ready for immediate action  --  while among them passed a half-naked black servant handing out roast sweet potatoes still smoking from the ashes and served on a piece of bark without a sign of cutlery or even salt . To drink , there was a gourdfuleach of the " water weakened with vinegar " which was Marion 's customary beverage . " This is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquired with interest , puzzled as to why this should be so at a permanent headquarters . " Oh , no , " drawled Horry , breaking the potato in two in the middle and biting into it . " We often fare worse than this in  --  emergen-cies. "  | " In fact , " Marion added gently , " this is a special occasion because to-. day there is a second helping  --  of the same . " Captain Verney tried to imitate Harry 's methods and burnt his fingers and his tongue . " What pay do you get here ? " he inquired when he could speak . " Not a cent , " said Horry flatly , and Captain Verney began to suspect that he was being got at . " Are you fellows joking ? " he demanded . " No , " said Horry sadly . " It ai n't funny  --  sometimes . " " You mean you actually live like this , without pay or rations  --  ? But why do you stand for it ? Surely you deserve better than this ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Julian began slowly , for Marion seemed embarrassed by what appeared to be almost pity in the visitor 's face and made no reply , " there is some idea of achieving liberty  --  even without pay . " Verney looked at him sharply , for it was the first time he had spoken . " You sound like a Londoner . " " I was . " " Are you a prisoner here , then ? " " Not here , no . " " Your fellows took him at Camden , " Horry explained with some satisfaction , " and we got him back again at Nelson 's F-Ferry . When he 's delirious he talks G-Greek . " " You have joined the rebels  --  of your own free will ? " gaped the captain . " My dear sir , " said Julian pleasantly , " I have the honor to be a rebel . " " But you  --  if I may say so , this is no life for a man like yourself ! " " Well , that is your opinion , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care much for Charleston society just now . " " But I do n't understand ! " insisted Captain Verney . " You are one of Us . " " No , there you really are mistaken , " said Julian firmly , and turned with affectionate deference to the enchanted Marion , who could not have been so blissfully rude to a guest if his life had depended on it . " Did you mean what you said , sir , about that second helping today ? " The captain stared about him again at the hard , unsmiling faces wiped so clean of all expression save a studious courtesy.  | " It is epic , " he stated simply . " They will not believe it , at home . I do not quite believe it myself . " He accepted a second potato with alacrity . " These are roots , are they not ? And you live on them , without  --  without even rum , I take it . All for liberty . England will lose this war , " said the captain simply , and burnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belated reply to his request for a surgeon from Hillsborough , in the form of a letter delivered by his Captain Melton who returned full of news . Marion sent for Julian to hear it , and Horry and some others gathered round . The letter was from General Greene , who had arrived at Charlotte to replace Gates in command of the southern army . " Good ! " said Julian in relief . " Now you will see a change  --  if it 's not too late . " Marion 's dark , secretive face brooded above the letter . " He sounds like a good man . Do you know him ? " " I had a friend at Brandywine . He says Greene is the next best man to Washington . " " I would have said so myself , " said Melton , and a wary sort of hope showed in the gaunt faces which turned towards him as he spoke . " Best man I 've seen , bar one . " And his eyes went doglike to his leader . " My friend at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He says we are to go on here as we are until further notice , " said Marion , his eyes on the letter . " He says  --  ' Until a more permanent army can be collected than is in the field at present , we must endeavor to keep up a partisan war , and preserve the tide of sentiment among the people as much as possible in our favor . Spies are the eyes of an army , ' " Marion read out slowly from the letter , " and without them a general is always crossing in the dark , and can neither secure himself nor annoy his enemy . It is of the highest importance that I get the earliest informationof any reinforcements which may arrive at Charleston , or leave the town to join Lord Cornwallis . I wish you , therefore , to fix some plan for procuring such information , and for conveying it to me with all possibledispatch. . . . ' judging by the signature , it looks as though the whole thing is written in his own hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers . " Think likely , since he 's got no secretary to write it for him , " said Melton . " They are mighty understaffed up there , and all the officersp207work twenty-four hours a day , almost . Colonel Williams is there  --  he is a good man to have in the field , and what he does n't know about Camdenyou could put in your eye . Guess by now Greene has got the rights of that , if there was any doubt in his mind to start with ! And Harry Lee has come in with a troop of light horse . They will be a help . ' Pears Gates did n't believe in cavalry  --  leastways not before Tarleton charged him at Camden . But Greene ca n't even spare officers for a court martial , that 's why Gates is gettin ' off so easy . " " You say General Greene wants a secretary , " said Marion , without lifting his eyes from the letter . " I should say he wants two . But he wo n't get ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lint and bandages , he says , let alone a spare surgeon , and an action now would mean a terrible loss in wounded , for lack of care . He is moving down to Cheraw soon , for winter quarters . " " So I am to become a not very glorified spy , " Marion mused above the letter . " Well , so be it . That is all , gentlemen . Captain Melton , you will be prepared to start back with my reply to General Greene in the morning . " " Any time you say , General . " They rose informally , made for the tent door in a bunch , and jostled through it . As they went " Mr. Day , " said Marion , and Julian turned back to where Marion sat quietly , holding the letter , looking tired and small and very much alone . " Is there something I can do , sir ? " " You heard what he said about General Greene needing a secretary . " " Yes , sir . " . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greene for duty . " " But  --  I 'd rather stay here , sir . I 'll be fit for active service soon  --  in fact , I am now if you would only  --  " " In an army that is properly run , " Marion interrupted thoughtfully , " a good soldier does not express preferences to his commanding officer . " " I 'm sorry , sir , but  --  " " Nor does he say But to an order . " Julian was silent , wearing a dogged look . " You are not fit for active service as we perform it here  --  and you never will be , though your shooting has certainly improved since you began target practice with Horry . " There was a silence , and Marion sighed and raised his head . His piercing eyes ran over Julian 's splendid height , clothed now in rough homespun and broken boots , but carried with that indefinable air that made him " one of Us " to the son of a British earl . Marion 's rare smile broke slowly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is run the way it should be  --  a good general does n't indulge himself in friendships in the middle of a campaign either . I shall miss  --  our talks , Mr. Day . But you start north with Melton in the morning . " " Very good , sir , " said Julian stiffly . " That is all , Mr. Day . Good night . " " Good night , sir . " But in the early morning , with Melton saddling up and a few silent men waiting round for awkward farewells to the stranger who had become one of them , Julian sought Marion 's tent again and met the little general coming out . " Good morning , sir . I  --  wanted to say good-bye . " " I had something the same idea , " said Marion drily . " You see . Mr. Day  --  " He hesitated and seemed to find it difficult . " You see , I do not need a secretary . " " I know , " said Julian , smiling . " And I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no good to you , I can see that . I only hope General Greene can find a use for me . I 've  --  enjoyed myself here , sir . In that army you spoke about , is a rather second-rate infantryman permitted to wish his commanding officer luck ? " Marion made a vague gesture of cleansing his right hand on the seat of his breeches before he held it out . " I 'm not one for speeches , " he said , with an effort . " But God bless you , boy . " They were not to meet again . For his journey Julian had been outfitted with fine whole British doeskinbreeches in which it was necessary to lay a pleat at the belt , and a less imposing coat of scarlet regimentals which had been turned a sort of brownish-purple with a streaky vegetable stain . Still , as Horry remarked , it was better than wearing it inside out to avoid accidents , like some . He wore a British tricorne too , from which the cockade had been removed , and a scarlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a size too large . They gave him the same horse  --  Neddy 's horse  --  which he had ridden away from Nelson 's Ferry . Following the swampy course of the Peedee northward with Melton , he came early in January to Cheraw and what was fondly called by General Greene a camp of repose . It was anything but that , for Greene had come to Carolina not so much to command an army as to create one . Julian presented his credentials at headquarters and was put to work copying despatches . He had had no idea of the secretarial work involved in fighting a war . Several copies of each letter had to be made , sometimes in order that it might have the benefit of two separate post-bags in the hope of getting one of them through to its destination , sometimes in order that more than one superior or subordinate might know exactly what had been said to the others , sometimes to report progress or relay information in an endless chain . He wrote for hours at a stretch , thankfulthat his wound had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gripped his hand and the cords at the back of his neck rebelled against holding up his head at that angle any longer ; wrote until the words danced and blurred on the page in the yellow candlelight . But he was getting a new insight into the war now . He was seeing dimly what lay behind the lack of supplies and the seemingly hopeless muddle which caused the often needless hardships of the common soldiers , as he copied out Greene 's persistent itemized appeals for bare necessities  --  everything was lacking at Cheraw from breeches to cartouche-boxes , and there was no transport at all  --  and then wrote tactful replies to the disheartening letters from Richmond o , r Philadelphia on what was being done , and why more had not been done , etc. , etc . Greene himself had an enormous , sleepless capacity for work , and was greatly beloved by his jaded associates . Julian liked everything he heard about his new commander  --  how he had been read out of meeting in his Rhode Island Quaker community after joining the local militia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joke , and had married a gay , pretty wife with whom he was openly in love  --  how he had missed Bunker Hill by a day and had hardly been out of the sound of cannon fire since then  --  how at Harlem he had seized the drag-ropes of the artillery himself when his men wavered , and how his impersonation of Dr. Slop in Tristram Shandy was as good as a play  --  each anecdote re- lated to the newcomer by an admiring staff added to the general 's stature . He called no councils of war , and confided in no one , and nothing was too trivial for his attention . He was hampered at every turn by the lack of hard money , and few of the local merchants would sell to him for paper money . He paid the country women roundabout in salt for some shirtmaking . It was difficult even to find enough paper money for the express riders ' needs . But while Cheraw was no Egypt , as Greene himself was the first to admit , food and forage were more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cornwallis was wintering at Winnsborough west of the Wateree , with strong posts at Camden , Ninety-six , and Fort Granby . In order to worry him , Greene detached General Morgan with nine hundred men including Colonel William Washington 's cavalry to work the country beyond the Catawba in Cornwallis ' rear . Before January was out , Morgan sent back word that he had defeated Tarleton at the Cowpens , and the details made cheerful hearing at Greene 's headquarters . William Washington , cousin of the Commanderin-Chief , was the hero of that glorious day  --  for when the British seemed to have carried all before them and were huzzahing their triumph Washingtonordered his bugle-boy to sound the charge and his troop of highly irregular horse galloped headlong into the enemy with sabres swinging . In the melee which followed Washington and Tarleton met face to face , and although Tarleton 's men were already giving ground he turned , with an aide either side of him , for a personal encounter with his enemy . Washington was accompanied only by a sergeant and the bugler  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sword . The sergeant disabled the sabre arm of one of the aides who was trying to cut Washington down from behind while Tarleton engaged him in the center , and the little bugler pistoled the aide who was coming in on the other side . Washington parried Tarleton 's thrust and wounded him in the right hand . Tarleton wheeled to discharge his pistol , catching Washingtonin the knee , and retired in some haste . It was truly a rout for the British , who had lost over two hundred casualties and six hundred prisoners  --  Colonel Howard was said to have had the surrendered swords of five British officers in his hand at one time . But  --  there was always a But to good news  --  Tarleton had gotp211away and Cornwallis himself was now within thirty miles of Morgan with reinforcements , and the Americans were therefore retreating at top speed eastwards towards the upper Catawba fords with their spoils . Roads were bad and rivers were swollen with winter rains . The camp at Cheraw drank William Washington 's health in cherry bounce , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feu de joie , and found itself under marching orders for Salisbury to the north , with all detachments called in and all stores to be collected and loaded . GeneralHuger and Colonel Williams were to command the main army on this march , while Greene set out across country , with only one aide and a sergeant 's guard of dragoons , to meet Morgan in front of Cornwallis . Julian had come up in the world now , and rode his own horse among the other members of General Huger 's official family , on the winter march northwards along the Peedee . But his knowledge of what the men in the ranks were enduring was acute . Many of them had only blankets around their waists like Indians , and their unshod feet left bloody tracks in the rutted red clay roads . Rain was almost incessant . Before they reached Salisbury , Greene had joined Morgan and sent back an express with orders changing the rendezvous from Salisbury to Guilford Courthouse , as the retreat forced him ever eastward . On February eighth the two armies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheraw , were united near Guilford Courthouse . But there was no time to rest , though Morgan 's men had already travelled a hundred and fifty miles almost on the run from the other side of the Catawba , and Huger 's had hurried a hundred miles from Cheraw over hideous terrain , with horses so played out they could hardly move the wagons . Greene could muster now about two thousand men , including five hundred militia whose time of service was nearly up , and two hundred cavalry . Cornwallis had something under three thousand , with three hundred cavalry , including the punished remainder of Tarleton 's fa/I2 mous dragoons from the Cowpens . Both armies were in bad condition from sickness , lack of wagon transport and insufficient food , and both suffered from the weather . The British were better shod and better clothed and on the whole better provisioned , but at the same time it was not at all the kind of war they were accustomed to . Cornwallis had failed to prevent a junction between the two American forces , and the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia and compel him to fight at a disadvantage or surrender . The armies were only twenty-five miles apart . Greene was determined to avoid an engagement at present , and on the tenth he gave orders to press on northward  --  drawing Cornwallis always farther from his bases , cripplinghis communications , wearing out his drenched and bewildered regulars . Lincoln and Gates in turn had failed . On the bedraggled survivorsof those failures and on a leader tireless as fate rested the outcome of the southern campaign , perhaps of the whole war . Virginia was Greene 's source of supply , and was stanchly Whig in sentiment . He had left General Steuben in Richmond as he came south last December  --  Steuben the Prussian drillmaster , who in 1778 by a potentmixture of patience and profanity had made a disciplined army out of the frostbitten rabble which wintered at Valley Forge . Steuben had not had a word of English then , but he kept an American aide beside him when he exercised the companies , to swear at the troops in words they could take to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of German and bad French ; and he was not too great , either , to take the musket himself and march and wheel the awkward squad off its feet . It was said that when Lafayette once expressed surprise at the orderliness which finally reigned in camp , and the absence of noise in which the troops conducted their daily affairs , Steuben had replied in even greater surprise , " Noise , my lord Marquis ? I do not know where noise should come from , when even my brigadiers dare not open their mouths but to repeat my orders ! " Nevertheless Steuben 's men all adored him , partly because he took an active and open-handed interest in their private lives  --  he never had any money because he gave it all away . Greene was happy to know that he had Steuben at his back , and Jefferson got along with him well enough , despite the wear and tear of their respective positions at Richmond . Muhlenberg and Nelson , who commanded the militia in Virginia , hadp213accepted him gratefully as their superior . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who had tried to conceal from him their ability to supply the equipment he needed for the destitute army . Once across the Dan and in closer contact with Richmond , Greene hoped to be replenished from a friendly population hitherto free of British depredations . Marion , Pickens , and Sumter must do what they could with partisan warfare in Carolina until he could return to its defense . Food was already better , discipline was better , spirits were higher among the Americans under Greene 's leadership , in spite of the gruelling marches over the red clay roads which hardened at night , went into slime during the day , and were deeply cut with horse and wagon tracks . Greene had never had his clothes off since he joined Morgan on the Catawba , and he slept in the saddle . At night while the army rested on the frosty ground with one blanket to three men , he wrote and dictated letters by the light of a sputtering lantern . The two armies were so close together that Cornwallis ' advance guard under O'Hara and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant skirmishes and the greatest vigilance was necessary on the American side to preventa night surprise . Patrols had to be so numerous that each man got only six hours ' sleep out of each forty-eight . Neither dared to halt long , and so killing was the pace that an early breakfast was the only real meal served during the day . This way the armies covered an exhausting average of thirty miles a day . By the middle of February Greene 's men had won the race and were bivouacked on the far side of the Dan , from where they saw Cornwallis turn back thwarted towards Hillsborough , where he raised the royal standard . He had not captured the American army , but he had at least chased it out of the Carolinas and he now anticipated a general Tory uprising in his favor . In the camp beyond the Dan on Virginian soil , Julian was sorting out the contents of a newly arrived post-bag when Greene erupted into the tent and fell upon his letters . " What in the name of the Almighty is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seals . " Arnold , sir ? I understood he had got away to the British at West Point . "  |p2I4  " That is not news , Mr. Day ! But Williams says he has just heat ( I Arnold is in Virginia  --  and that wants looking into ! Ah , here we are  --  a letter from Steuben ! " Julian waited with only a pretense of occupying himself while the general read with deliberation and sounds of annoyance the letter from Steuben . Then he waited while Greene expressed himself at some length on the black treasonous soul of Benedict Arnold . When he could bear it no longer " Did you  --  did I hear you say something about Arnold being actually in the James River , sir ? " " The fellow has had the brass to burn Richmond ! " Greene told him furiously . " Sailed up the James with a flotilla full of Loyalists and regularslike a pirate and burnt the capital because it would n't surrender ! Steuben had nothing much to defend it with on such short notice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered and no one was taken . " " Williamsburg ? " said Julian , and his tongue was dry . " What happened at Williamsburg ? " " Nothing , so far . Nelson is there , with only four hundred men . Arnoldhas gone back down the river and begun to fortify Portsmouth , while he awaits reinforcements from New York . There is a price on his head . And while I do n't want the money  --  as God is my witness , I would n't take the money , but what would n't I give just for the chance to take Arnold 's head ! " " Are we going after it , sir ? " asked Julian hopefully , and the bloodthirstyex-Quaker rose and walked about the narrow tent , round and round the table , in an agony of decision and renunciation . " Lead me not into temptation ! " prayed General Greene . " I can not turn my back on Cornwallis now . Nay , nay , I have set my hand to the plough in Carolina  --  no pleasure trips in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , beyond the Dan  --  " " But with Arnold in our rear  --  " Julian ventured , in a private ordeal of his own . " Steuben will have to account for him , from Richmond  --  while we stray not from the path of duty nor lust for the stolen fruit of vengeance on the traitor . God give me strength , " implored Nathaniel Greene , whose boyhood piety of phrase had not left him just because the Quakers hadp215disowned him , " God give me strength to hew to the line here , where my duty lies ! And at the same time , may God strengthen Steuben 's arm , and bring the sinner Arnold to a meet and terrible end ! " " Yes , sir . But could n't we just go up to Portsmouth and hang him ourselves ? " Greene paused and bent upon Julian a look half angry , half playful . Not many of his military family took the liberties his quiet-voiced secretarywas allowed . Not many of them knew to such a hair 's breadth where the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or how to tickle his somewhat undernourished and sometimes unrefined sense of humor . " Cornwallis would keep , sir . And we are half way to Portsmouth now , " said Julian , returning the look with eyes which were steady and anxious . " Get thee behind me , Satan , " said General Greene . " Half way toPortsmouth from where ? " " From Cornwallis , sir . " " If only my geography was as bad as yours ! " sighed Greene , and his tongue slipped still further into the language of his youth , as it was likely to do at times of stress or moments of genuine affection . " Thee can not hope to turn me from my duty , Mr. Day , by such flagrant appeals to my baser side , I promise thee . And thee knows as well as I do that the traitor Arnold is not the real enemy . He is at Hillsborough still -- -and thither lies our way . Thee will take down a letter , please , to General Steuben . " Julian said no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself here , in an army bivouac with the surging Dan between himself and the British , while behind him the particular spot he had gone out to fight for lay defenseless in the path of destruction . There was the Virginia militia , of course , but the militia had not prevented the burning of Richmond .. . He thought of Aunt Anabel , and her airy conviction that if only she had a couple of good swordsmen in the house she was safe . He thought for the thousandth time of St. John and what could have become of him after that brief glimpse at Camden . All his inquiries among the officers who had gathered at Charlotte and Hillsborough after the battle had failed to yield any word of St. John , beyond the obvious fact that he was not among them . And he thought of Tibby , frightened , robbed , or bullied by the soldiery . When he thought of Regina , he hardened his heart . Regina would welcome the British as friends and deliverers , and nothing unpleasant would happen to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ask how things were with them , for there was no way to send a letter and no address at which he could receive a reply . The army would soon be on the move again , reinforced and refreshed , southward across the Dan . But the Tories did not do much rallying round Cornwallis after all  --  perhaps because Greene lost so little time in taking up the trail again , which was easy enough to follow by the smoking ruins in the wake of Tarleton 's raids . Cornwallis knew too that Greene was receiving reinforcementsas he came  --  Stevens , Lawson , Eaton , Butler , each with their fresh contingents . For Cornwallis there was nothing nearer than Wilmington . Keeping Lee 's alert light cavalry between the main army and Corn wallis , Greene advanced warily , shifting his ground daily , until it seemed to the Tories and Cornwallis that Greene was everywhere . At last he felt strong enough to risk battle on ground of his own choosing , and he chose Guilford Courthouse , which his knowing eye had marked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to make a stand . Cornwallis , on whom the cat-and-mouse game of dodging about the countryside had begun to tell , recognized the necessity for some conclusiveaction . His regulars knew how to behave under fire . But these long , aimless-seeming marches through cold and hunger were demoralizing them to the point of desertion . Also , unless he could show a victory soon , a lasting victory , the Tories would never join him . At the same time , a decisive defeat would be his ruin . Cornwallis was cornered at last . Greene arrived at his battlefield late in the day on March fourteenth , and Julian rode with him and the quartermasters while he surveyedp217again the ground which Cornwallis had not been clever enough to occupybefore him . Julian was wondering what would happen now if Cornwallis would not come out and fight . He was noting too the differencebetween the preparations which went on all around him here and the bungling , extemporaneous doings before Camden . Sitting his horse at the general 's side , he watched the weary , muddy column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their drums and form battalions , dressing right and supporting arms as required by Steuben 's new manual of regulations . Within a remarkably short time the pickets and grass-guards were out , the drums were beating for wood and water detachments , arms were piled , and the tents began to go up ; the sinks were being dug , the wagon-park took form behind the sutler 's tents and cook-fires , and the smell of supper was soon in the air . He had seen it done before under Greene 's business-like command but it never failed to impress him as a sign of the discipline and spirit of men whose every action was likely to attract the all-seeing eye of the general . It was Greene 's habit too sometimes to go the Grand Rounds himself at night , giving the countersign and visiting the sentries like any officer-of-the-day . This made for wakefulness and punctilio among the guards . There was no fumbling about in the dark this time in a blindfold attempt to anticipate the enemy 's intentions and positions . Everybody knew exactly where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt a surge of almost schoolboy excitement and confidence , as he followed the little knot of officers back to the Courthouse building on the brow of the hill , where headquarters were established . This time Cornwallis would catch it . He paused on the steps of the Courthouse and looked back . The field stretched away below him in the late light like a map  --  copse-woods , clearings , and ravines , cut by the road to Salisbury along which the British must approach . The Carolina militia , which would form the front line , had a rail fence to act as breastworks with an open cornfield in front of it . Three hundred yards to their rear in the second growth oak woods lay the Virginia militia . And on the hill 's crest to the right of the Courthouse were Huger 's and Williams ' veterans as a strong reserve . Two of the four precious big guns were being tugged into positionjust in front of him by grunting cannoneers . The other two werep218down the road with the second line . Lee 's light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flanks . While he stood there , the sunset drums began to beat the retreat on the right , and all the other drums woke to instant response . The brisk spring air was sweet with woodsmoke and the fragrance from soup-pots . It was a peaceful and orderly scene , he thought with some astonishment . It was hard to believe that by tomorrow night " Mr. Day ! " " Yes , sir , coming , sir . " There was a frost during the night , and the morning broke cool and clear . Breakfast was savoury and unhurried . The general beat at six o'clock , tents were struck , and the baggage moved to the rear . Lee had gone out with some of his light horse to reconnoitre along the Salisbury road , and soon a courier came back at full gallop to report the British army on the march . Cornwallis had taken up the gage . The faces round the council table in the Courthouse were grave but confident . The gravity was caused by something other than respect for Cornwallis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just before the council dispersed . " If you have no objection , sir , I  --  there is something we wanted to say , " he began , and looked nervous as a girl under Greene 's amused regard . " Could n't you save it till after we get all this out of the way ? " Greene inquired patiently . " No , sir . " " Oh , very well , if you must make a speech  --  ! " " It is only this , sir . We feel  --  we recognize perhaps more clearly than you can do yourself , sir , how much depends on you  --  on your continued presence in the field . Without you , sir , the south is lost . And so  --  I have been asked to say  --  to beg you on behalf of us all not to expose yourself needlessly in this engagement , sir . We are here to run your errands under fire . There is not one of us who can not be replaced . But if we should lose you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He sat down , rather red around the ears . Greene was touched . For a moment there was silence in the bleak room while he sat with his eyes on the covered top of the table beneath his big quiet hands.  | " If you want me to fight the battle from here , " he said then , " you should have hung on to Gates , he is your man for that . " " You are worth ten of Gates to us , sir , " said Stevens brusquely , and Greene looked up at him under his brows . " And for why ? " he demanded . " Because the men know where to find me  --  out there amongst ' em ! If I am indispensable , and no man is that , the hand of the Lord will cover me . To your posts , gentlemen . " The day was turning unseasonably warm , and Greene took off his hat and wiped his shining brow with a big blue and white handkerchief as he rode down to inspect the front lines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breastbone , came behind with Major Burnet , one of the aides , and looked with compassion at the poor devils along the rail fence awaiting their first sight of the enemy . They were all good marksmen , he knew , with two brigades of rifles among them , but they were new troops , dreading the British bayonet . Himself the veteran of many bitter skirmishes since his first battle , Julian had not forgotten his own sensations at Camden , and the comfort of having Neddy Blake beside him . He still missed Neddy in a crisis . Individual faces stood out as he followed his general along the lines  --  a boy 's face , starched with fright , staring enviously at the men on horseback who were not stationed here under the first onslaught ; a hard , unshaven , grim face , empty of all but the determination to kill ; a mocking , grinning face like Neddy 's , at ease and unafraid  --  what was it doing in the militia ? His eyes went back to the terrified boy  --  he wished that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Greene 's voice rang out strongly  --  " Three rounds , my lads  --  three rounds , and then you may fall back ! " he said , and the men grinned and cheered him , and he grinned back and raised his hand in a broad gesture full of fellowship and command , and they all felt better for a sight of him , and hitched up their breeches and spat copiously and demanded in loud , truculent tones if his lordship thought they had all day to wait for him and his red-coated bastards  --  but their laughter was a little too shrill for realism . Greene 's smiling calm was infectious . By noon , when they had made the rounds , Julian had achieved an almost Olympian detachment , so certain was he now that this time the Carolinians would stand , and that with Lee and William Washington instead of Armand to deal with Tarleton even the famous dragoons would meet their match . Greene on his tour of inspection had arrived last of all at Washington 's post on the right behind the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance at the dark-browed ruffian who had contrived personallyto give him that wound in the knee at the Cowpens . William Washington had the same powerful frame and modest ways as his relative , the Commander-in-Chief . His sabre stroke was certain death , and his handwriting was small and lacy like a woman 's . Soon after they left him and rode back slowly towards the observationpost near the Courthouse , vicious firing began in the distance , as Lee made contact and fell back towards the main army . About one o'clock the British fifes and drums were heard , long before the van swung into view down the road , their banners caught by a light breeze . Moving in blocks like toy soldiers , ignoring a sharp cannonade by Singleton 's two pieces in the road ahead of them , they deployed superbly either side of the road and formed their lines , while their artillery came up and began to reply . It was a beautiful - sight and a terrifying one , and Julian 's stomach turned over as he watched . Could anything shake them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage this time , either in position or numbers , but he was forming a line without reserves , except for cavalry , as though he had no doubt that a single onset would sweep the field . The kilted Highlanders of the Seventy-first , the Guards , and the Hessiansformed his right ; the Twenty-third , the Thirty-third , some LoyalistVolunteers , and the Grenadiers were on his left . Tensely the group surrounding General Greene awaited the sound of the Carolinians ' fire from the breastworks which were hidden by the - reel between . It came unevenly , at random . They were too far away it the Courthouse to hear the British commands , but the woods ended abruptly in bare cornfields which the British had to cross without cover of any kind and the downhill slope was just sufficient for the watchers at the Courthouse to catch glimpses through the cannon smoke as the red lines halted , made ready , and fired into the American breastworks . And then , behind the drifting haze of their own volley , the British threw forward their bayonets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p221There  was no reply to the British volley . The Carolinians had panicked , throwing away their muskets , canteens , and knapsacks in a wild stampede to the rear . Butler 's aide came tearing up the road on a bleedinghorse and gasped out to Greene that there was no longer a front line . " It 's an utter rout , sir ! They are running like sheep ! It 's up to the second line now , sir ! " Julian , through his incredulous horror , became aware of a voice . " The God-damned , string-spined , lily-livered sons of sin , not an ounce of guts in a mile of them ! " said General Greene , and drove home his spurs . " No , no  --  let me go , sir  --  General , let me take the order  --  " Burnet shot out after him , and both were swallowed up in the smoke . Julian and the remaining aide , Morris , looked at each other , tightlipped . " Come on , then , " said Morris , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even Greene , was quite abreast of the battle after that . The Virginians in the second line knew that they opened ranks and let the Carolina militia through , taunting them as they fled , and then faced the British advance bravely , cutting great gaps in the red line with a well-delivered volley . For a while , bayonet to bayonet , they bore the weight of the attack . But it was too much for them , and they fell back from the right , uncovering the Continentals to the Grenadiersand the Twenty-third , while the left still held . The Continentals knew that they had a stirring glimpse of General Greene as he rode among them in the gunpowder murk  --  " Stand firm ! " he cried to them . " Steady , now , and you can finish it , our fire is taking effect ! " These were Williams ' men , and Huger 's . Coolly they poured in a volley and then went to the bayonet . The British staggered and gave ground . And then Washington 's bugles sounded and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all dissolved into the shrieking , clanking , iron-shod carnage of the cavalry charge . When he had passed , the whole British left rallied doggedly , but the Continentals met them again and fought like men inspired , discipline for discipline , against the regulars . It was Cornwallis himself who decided the day . Relying on the seasonedmen he commanded , he ordered his artillery to open at close range , firing ruthlessly into the Grenadiers and the Twenty-third , in order to check the stubborn advance of the Marylanders . His officers turned awayp222sick at the sight , but Cornwallis called it stern necessity , and stood by grimly while the British cannon spoke again and again , mowing down red coats and blue impartially . Julian , galloping down to the left on courier duty , arrived just in time to see the Virginians there give way at last , and to learn that Lee , presumably still fighting the Hessians in the woods , had lost touch . He came pelting back along the littered road and overtook Stevens , wounded and being removed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces still to the enemy . Riding wide to clear a hallooing gang of Marylanders who had found some of Hamilton 's Loyalists to deal with , he came to the screaming , smoking , bleeding confusion in front of the British cannon , and almost collided with Greene , who was also riding full tilt into it in an effort to pierce the battle smoke and see for himself where the destructive fire was coming from . " In God 's name , sir  --  ! " gasped Julian , and so far forgot himself as to lay hold of the general 's bridle . " That misbegotten son of Satan is firing into his own men ! " shouted Greene , his face white with his un-Quakerish fury . " Will you please turn back , sir , the cannon are just beyond us  --  ! " " What an army they have got ! " yelled Greene above the din , with a kind of awe . " What infernal discipline ! Could thee believe it if thee did not see ? He is slaughtering his own officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it , boy  --  I have n't got the black-hearted courage to do such a thing ! " " Stevens has a ball in his thigh , sir  --  " " Where is Lee ? " " Out in the woods on the left , sir , engaging the Hessians  --  has n't been heard from for some time . Lawson says it is no good now , sir  --  they have turned our left flank and Tarleton 's dragoons are drawn up in the road awaiting the order to charge ! Lawson is falling back to the Court-house  --  " " It 's these damned raw troops they send me ! One half that first line never fired at all ! It takes veterans to win a battle , and I have n't got enough of them ! If only I had more Marylanders  --  " With a glance over his shoulder towards the steady pound of wellservedcannon and the whine and crash of the shot , Julian wheeled the general 's horse and still holding its bridle started smartly for the highp223ground near the Courthouse . Greene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unexpectedly docile . " Merciful God , he was destroying half the battalion , and they rallied and formed again ! " he marvelled . " We can not win now  --  he has done it again , damn him . Well , it was very near  --  we shall have to retreat again , but his losses must be terrible  --  terrible ! Now that you have rescued me singlehanded , Mr. Day , will you be so good as to find Colonel Williams and tell him to prepare to fall back to the old camp at Troublesome Creek ! We must leave our wounded . " For Julian , the confident excitement of the morning had now to give way to a disappointment so dire as to amount to despair . They had been so near to winning the battle  --  the British were groggy and reeling , one more fresh wave of Marylanders would have done the business , but there were not enough Continentals there at the Courthouse to follow up Williams ' advantage . It was somehow worse than Camden , because it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been present on the equally heartbreakingday at Brandywine , nor seen Lafayette almost weeping with frustrationafter Monmouth . He had acquired no philosophy for defeat when victory had seemed possible . He had seen the panic of the Carolina militia coming back from the front line  --  seen men flee with starting eyes and hoarse sounds of terror while their frantic officers caught at them , actually wrestled with them , cursing , threatening , and pleading . He had seen the gallant stand of the Virginians , who to be sure were well aware that Stevens had posted riflemen behind them to shoot down the first to submit to any unauthorized desire to retreat . He had seen Washington 's cavalry reform after the charge , blown and gashed and fewer in number , but quite ready to go in again . And all for nothing . All just to leave Cornwallis in possession of the field again , counting hideous losses it was true , but still technically the victor . Julian took it very hard . From Troublesome Creek , which they reached after a dreary night march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a white flag to tend the American wounded . And to a return flag from Cornwallispompously demanding surrender , he replied tersely : " I am prepared to sell you another field at the same price . " The battered American army , which had acquitted itself so much better this time than at Camden , was in remarkably high spirits . Their losses were much lighter , they knew , than those of the British , and they had retired in good order from a stoutly contested battleground . Cornwalliswas not beaten , maybe , but he was badly mauled , and they were willing to try again . But the British were retreating towards Wilmington , and once more the short militia term became a factor to an American general . There would be no holding them now once their time was up , with such a story to tell . Regretfully Greene decided to let Cornwallis go , and to turn his attention to Rawdon at Camden , where Marion and Sumter could be of assistance with their partisan troops . Julian sat at the rickety camp table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondence . The general was writing a letter to his wife , his face gentle and unguarded in the lantern-light . Julian 's task was making a copy of a letter to General Steuben which was to be enclosed in the bag which was going to the Commander-in-Chief . " We fight , we get beat , rise , and fight again , " he wrote , transcribing from Greene 's neat , unhurried script . " I am determined to carry the war immediatelyinto South Carolina . The enemy will be obliged to follow us , or give up their posts in that state . If the former takes place . . . " There was a flurry outside , and the sentry 's voice  --  an orderly came in hastily with a post-bag just arrived by express from Richmond . Eager as he was for news from the north , Julian forced himself to go on writingwhile Greene broke the seals , until " God he praised ! " cried Greene , and slapped the table with his hig hand so that the ink-horn and lantern jumped . " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is coming south ! He was at Head of Elk when this was written ! He is coming to Virginia with an army to cook Arnold 's goose ! Bless the boy , what I would n't give to see him here ! Ah , well ! " He dismissed that happy possibility with a sigh . " Still , this puts a very different look on things , I promise thee ! Wherever he is , the Marquis is worth his weight in wildcats ! Mr. Day  --  never mind that , whatever it is  --  take down a letter , please , to General Lafayette . My dear Marquis  --  To say that I am rejoiced to hear of your appointment to the Virginia command is superfluous . I could wish that your marching orders had included  --  No  --  no , perhaps not , I think thee had better take a fresh sheet of paper . My dear Marquis ... "  |p225Williamsburg  had dreamed on through the summer heat , after Julian left it . There was little news from the north until August , when St. John sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Kalb , which said that the arrival of Rochambeau at Newport with the first contingentof French troops sent to aid Washington had been very heartening at headquarters . And then , early in September , the first beaten stragglers from Camden began arriving back in Virginia . No further word came from St. John , and the story of de Kalb 's death was not reassuring . Julian seemed to have vanished on his way to Richmond . Had he too been with de Kalb ? Dorothea and Aunt Anabel waited , looking pinched and sleepless , through the long , baking days and the endless , sweet-scented nights . There was nothing else to do but wait , and try to hope that St. John had survived the battle and that Julian had not been there at all . It was not only in Williamsburg that the summer of 178o took its toll of fortitude and faith . A wave of weariness swept the whole country after Camden , a hopelessness worse than the near panic after the Jersey losses in 1776 . It was now four years since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still had not been driven out . The colonial government , decentralized into thirteen separate units , seemed paralyzed . The army was starving and never paid . Except for Saratoga and the French alliance , little had been gained , and these two happy augurieshad scant fulfillment . On top of everything else , came the scandal of Arnold 's treason at West Point , and the cause itself seemed to be falling apart . Then at the end of December the drums were beating the alarm from Yorktown to Richmond as a fleet of twenty-seven sail entered the Capes , and Nelson called out the militia on the Neck while Jefferson and Steubenprepared to evacuate all possible stores from Richmond . The Britishlanded at Hampton , seized small craft , and began to ascend the James . Word ran ahead of them that they were led by the traitor Arnold , and that there was a regiment of Loyalist cavalry under Simcoe from New York . Every effort was going to be made , people said , to take Arnold alive . Most of the plantation refuges of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plunder by a river-borne army , so that now the town houses seemed the safer place to be , and the women and children were kept there , while the menfolk looked to their weapons and the frightened militia drilled belatedly and took up cautious positions under hastily devised cover to the south and west of the city , as Arnold 's flotilla approached the broken church and tide-lapped ruins of Jamestown . Aunt Anabel said piteously  --  " Julian need n't have gone to the army , he could have defended us better here at home ! " On the third of January a small fishing-boat piloted by a half-grown Negro boy slid into the Landing on Queen 's Creek and made fast . The boy crawled forward and knelt beside a man who lay collapsed against the gunwale quite unaware that he had reached the end of his journey . " We done it , suh , " the boy announced with some pride , and shook the unresponsive shoulder of his passenger . " We slip through pretty as you please . You better be gettin ' home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that uniform . " The man roused himself and sat up dazedly . " What 's this ? " he asked . " Where are we ? " " Capitol Landing , suh  --  just where we was makin ' for . " " Good . That 's good . " But still the man sat confusedly blinking at the steps and the bank beyond as though he had no idea how to reach them . " Lemme help you out , suh . Best git under cover in them clothes I 'd say , suh . Redcoats all round us fust thing we know . "  | " Yes  --  yes , of course  --  must get home  --  will you help me as far as Francis Street ? " The Negro boy rolled apprehensive eyes over his shoulder at the empty landscape . He had collected his fee before starting , and was anxious to be rid of all connection with his dangerous cargo . " Got be gettin ' back tonight , suh  --  stormy weather and all  --  tai n't my boat , I ketch hell if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right  --  give me a hand , will you ? " Hoisted unceremoniously on to the slippery mud which covered the bottom steps at low tide , he grasped the handrail and dragged himself upward , replying with a vague gesture to the boy 's conscience-smitten , " Take keer yourself , suh , " as the boat cast off . His right leg was almost useless and would only bear his weight for a moment at a time . The dark blue coat of his uniform was torn and streaked with blood and dirt , he wore no shirt at all because it had long since gone for bandages , his boots were unspeakable . He had not had a shave for days . He plodded on painfully across the muddy planks of the Landing and into the road which led towards town . Sometimes there were trees or fence-posts to cling to  --  sometimes for as much as a dozen steps he had to limp forward with no aid at all , watching his feet , absorbed in the all but impossible task of putting one in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snatched up a shawl and ran down the path to where he had paused , holding dizzily to the crazy fence which separated the dooryard of the cabin from the coarse grass at the side of the road . " You must n't go into Williamsburg like that , sir ! " she cried . " The British are in the river ! " " Yes , I know they are  --  damn ' near rode straight into them  --  " " Mr. Sprague ! " Tibby came through the gate and laid supporting arms around his sagging body . " Oh , Mr. Sprague , I did n't know it was you ! You 're hurt  --  you must come inside and lie down --  " With an effort , he raised his head and focused on her face . " It 's Tibby , " he discovered with satisfaction . " That 's luck  --  I  --  wanted to see you . Tibby , where is Julian ? " " We do n't know , sir . He left for Richmond to join the army after Charleston fell . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stood holding to the fence and striving for consciousness . " I did n't dream it  --  afterwards . I saw him ! " " You saw him , sir ? " " At Camden . " He caught her arm with a grimy , shaking hand . " BeforeGod , Tibby , I had no choice  --  it was an order -- I had to leave him there  --  " " At Camden ? " There was white , fierce terror in her face . " You 1-left him  --  at Camden  --  ? " " With de Kalb . He was wounded  --  I do n't know how badly  --  " His eyes glazed . " Tibby , I 've got to get home  --  " " Yes , sir  --  you ought to be in bed  --  it 's not far now , I 'll help you walk , just lean on me  --  " " Run on ahead and fetch Joshua , will you ? That 's best  --  you ca n't help me  --  too heavy for you  --  please  --  run  --  " She left him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shawl streaming out behind her . After a moment he straightened again and began his limping progress in her wake , holding to things as he passed , but somehow keeping on his feet towards that blessed moment when Joshua 's powerful black arms would bear him up  --  the Capitol was in sight now at the end of the lane  --  and then he had reached the Duke of Gloucester Street  --  at last  --  everything was deserted there , the men had all gathered on the other side of town for the defense of Jamestownroad  --  two women coming , though  --  and he a sight to scare the birds from the treesRegina , accompanied by Lucinda , was on her way to the apothecary 's shop , for the arrival of the British in the river had brought on one of her mother 's headaches . They hurried through the fading winter afternoon , anxious to be home again before candlelighting , for no one knew what would be happening in the streets of the town tonight ... . " Look , Regina , there is another poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him prisoner if they come ? Ought n't we to  --  " " We must ask the apothecary to look after him . He -- St . John ! Oh , my dear love , I 've been so miserable  --  St. John , why did n't you send us any word , you will forgive me , wo n't you , St. John , you always do forgive me no matter how badly I behave to you , oh , thank God I 've got you back safe at last  --  I " It was Regina 's voice , they were Regina 's hands , Regina 's arms werep229round him  --  smiling , he slid into unconsciousness at her feet . Joshua and Tibby ran up breathless through the dusk and found them there  --  Regina kneeling in the winter mud of the Duke of Gloucester Street , her dress a blue velvet ruin , with St. John 's head cradled in her arms , while Lucinda stood above them crying , and the apothecary held hartshorn to St. John 's nose . Joshua stooped without a sound and took his master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a child 's , and carried him towards Francis Street . At the corner Dorothea met them , a white shawl thrown around her shoulders , and Aunt Anabel awaited them in the doorway . As Joshua passed into the house with his burden , Regina spoke from the gate " Please , Dolly  --  please , may I come in ? " After one look , which saw her for the first time with her muddied skirt and the tears running down her white cheeks , Dorothea held out sisterly arms . Lucinda followed them into the house , but Tibby turned away unnoticedin the dusk , hugging her shawl about her . She had done what was required of her and fetched Joshua , and now she had time to think again  --  now she could contemplate the icy fact that Julian had been at Camden after all , with de Kalb , and wounded . Some of them were taken prisoner , she knew . The Charleston prison ships were said to be floating hells . There would n't be surgeons , there would n't be food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Faintly , through the winter twilight , came the sound of firing , down Jamestown way . The British must have landed ! Tibby began to run towards home , panting , stumbling , blind with tears , seeking the shelter of familiar things in candlelight , and the reassuring presence of her mother , where nothing was ever quite so bad as it might be . Undressed , and patiently scrubbed clean and shaved by Joshua 's carefulhands and tucked into his own snowy bed again , St. John found himself drinking broth from a spoon , and looked up gratefully into Aunt Anabel 's sweet face . " Poor soul , " he murmured . " Did I give you an awful fright ? " " Now , Sinjie , do n't talk . You must drink this , and then go to sleep . "  | " Tell me just one thing , " he pleaded . " I did meet Regina  --  she was there in the street ? " " Yes , indeed she was , and she is still down stairs , with Dorothea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I thought maybe I was out of my head again , " he said , relieved . The spoon was waiting . More broth went down . " Do n't let her walk home alone , " he said . " The British are coming up the river . " " I know , dear . " " If they have any sense they will go straight on to Richmond . There is nothing for them here . " " The militia have gone down to Burwell 's Ferry . " " How many militia ? " " About four hundred , they say . Nelson has them . " " It 's not enough . " St. John drank more broth , and his eyelids were heavy . " Auntie , how am I going to tell Dorothea that I rode away and left Julian wounded at Camden ? " " Oh , Sinjie  --  wounded ? " " I was riding courier for de Kalb . The men on the left wing would n't stand , and de Kalb would n't retreat . Julian was fighting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I must be seeing things  --  but it was Julian , no mistake , he proved that . Then I had to leave him there with de Kalb  --  I do n't think we had better tell Dorothea there was a cavalry charge coming in . " " De Kalb died , " said Aunt Anabel . Her face quivered . " I 'm afraid they both did , " he said , and turned his head away from the spoon . " No more , Auntie . You must tell her  --  I 'm too tired  --  " " Yes , dear , I 'll tell her . Try and get some sleep now . " Before she was out of the room the heavy slumber of exhaustion claimed him . He never knew that they let Regina come and kiss him good-night before Joshua escorted her and Lucinda home through the empty streets , when the firing at Jamestown had stopped . He never knew either that later that night a scared and shaking black butler knocked on the door of Regina 's bedroom and said there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warm robe over her nightdress , tied her hair back with a ribbon , and descended the stairs . The candelabra on the drawing-room table had been lighted for the visitor , and it was David Allen who stood over the dying fire , wearingp231the tight green coat and white breeches of Simcoe 's Loyalist dragoons , and black cavalry boots . Regina 's heart lurched like an alarm bell . Only the day before , still nursing her obstinate quarrel with St. John , she might have been glad to see David , she could at least have acquiesced in his presence at Williamsburgin that uniform . But now her one thought was how to get rid of the man in the green coat before he found out that St. John lay helpless in Francis Street . There was the chance , of course , that David already knew that , perhaps had come because he knew . Simcoe could have received word from informers that an American officer had that day returned to Williamsburg . It would be quite a feather in Simcoe 's cap to capture one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must consider an unsettled score with St. John since that day at Farthingale . Arrest now would mean a British prison for St. John , where he was sure to die from lack of care ... . As Regina paused on the threshold her mind was busy with lies she could tell David , ways she could find to protect St. John  --  desperate , crazy , hopeless things she might do to keep David away from the house in Francis Street . He turned and stared at her unbelievingly as she stood there in the doorway . " Oh , God , I had forgotten how beautiful you are ! " was his only greeting . " David , what are you doing here like this ? Have they taken the town ? " " We could have it if we liked . The militia have scattered , as usual . My troop came ashore just to sweep up , and I  --  I have a few hours ' leave . " He came towards her with outstretched hands , his dark eyes shiningand hungry . " My darling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headed up river for Richmond in the morning . Regina  --  say you are glad to see me , ca n't you ? " " Yes , David , of course I 'm glad , but  --  what will you do at Richmond ? " " Burn it , if it wo n't surrender ! Hang Jefferson , we hope , and make an end to the war in Virginia as soon as possible ! " " Hang  --  Jefferson ! " " Jefferson for Andre ! Why not ? " " Oh , David , that 's murder ! "  | " I forgot he was a friend of yours . But we are at war , you know . Exceptfor tonight , that is . Sweetheart , I have moved heaven and earth to win this glimpse of you ! Come into the light  --  " Reluctantly , for she was seeing a great many things differently now , she let him take her hands and draw her into the room . " You must go , " she said urgently . " You are n't safe here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no militia any more ! And even if there were  --  it 's worth risking my neck to see you like this ! " " Please go , David . " She flushed as his gaze ran over the loose velvet gown and her unbound hair . " Some one might find you here  --  at this hour  --  " " It 's not quite the welcome I expected , " he said , bewildered . " From what you said before I went north I hoped  --  " " I was wrong , David . I have changed my mind . " " Well , upon my word , that 's pretty cool ! I hoped when I got into the Rangers you would be pleased with me ! " " I  --  I never thought you would come to burn Richmond , " she explainedlamely . " How else can we win wars , my dear , than by burning capitals and hanging rebels ? Williamsburg wo n't be touched , I fancy . We will make our headquarters at Portsmouth , and if things go well while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to come here again , do you hear ? Not while you wear that coat ! " " But I am wearing this coat because you always said  --  " " If I had anything to do with your joining Simcoe 's Rangers I 'm sorry . Terribly sorry . " " So you have changed sides since I went north ! " He looked at her narrowly . " You have turned rebel now ! May I ask why ? " She passed him towards the fire , her hands to her face , moving withouther usual proud assurance . Perhaps if he realized at once there was no longer the bond between them of belief in the King 's cause , he would be offended and go . Perhaps in his anger at her for deserting him he would forget about St. John , or leave Williamsburg without ever finding out that St. John had come back . " I do n't know what I am any more , David , I  --  have no right to judge anyone . I am rather ashamed of myself all round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any attention to me . What kind of man are you , anyway , to choose the color of your coat to please a woman , instead of having ideas of your own too strong for her to meddle with ? It does n't matter what I said  --  it is what you yourself believe that counts ! " His handsome , sulky face was bleak . " I suppose I have St. John Sprague to thank for this , " he accused , and her denial came too soon , too anxiously . " No , no , I  --  have n't seen him ! " David came to her on the hearthrug and turned up her face to his with a ruthless hand . The Williamsburg Tory who had informed on St. John Sprague naturally had not reported on Regina and one had had to come and see for oneself . It appeared that the thing he had most dreaded had happened in his absence and Regina had found her heart . Regina was lying to him to protect St. John  --  but would n't she perhaps the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment David must needs go on hoping . " You have seen him , " he said , her chin held fast between his finger and thumb . " Was n't he at Camden ? " " No  --  I do n't know . " " And was n't he sent home wounded ? " " David , you 're very frightening like this , I hardly know you ! " Deliberately , imprisoned in his hold , she drained her body of resistance , made it soft and helpless against his , gave him her blue eyes full of reproachand appeal . Because , whatever he might know , he was at least on the right track . It might rest with her now , what happened to St John . Her mind raced and fumbled among the things she might do  --  keep David here somehow  --  get word to St. John  --  but St. John could n't he moved  --  keep David here , but how  --  throw him off the scent  --  but how  --  persuade him that St. John meant nothing to her any more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You used not to treat me like a court martial , " she murmured and laid warm , coaxing fingers on the hand that held her chin , and saw his eyes take fire while his left arm went round her waist and caught her to him till the butt of the pistol he wore tucked into his sash bruised her ribs . " And do you really love a man for the color of his coat , Regina , or for the heart that beats inside it ? " he murmured , for if her quarrel with St. John was unabated he had nothing to regret in the accomplishment of his errand in Williamsburg , which , once he had taken it on , had weighed a little heavy . " Suppose the green coat I wear says I must arrest St. John Sprague 's blue one and escort it to Jamestown tonight  --  the fortunes of war , Regina ! I assure you he would do the same to me . And so to the victor  --  the spoils ! " She waited , soft and willing in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers stole towards the pistol which pressed her side . They had found and clasped it firmly before he lifted his head , but still she was in his arms , drawing back from him only a little , loosening his hold only by her own smiling confusion and a belated self-recovery . " That was very  --  presumptuous of you , " she whispered , putting him from her with a hand against his chest  --  and then with a sudden jerk she was free of him , the pistol torn from his sash and pointed at him , very level and steady . " You are going back to Jamestown alone , David  --  or not at all , " she said . He stared at her a moment , and then folded his arms with a smile . " You would n't really shoot me with that thing , " he marvelled . " You must give me your word of honor to ride straight back to Jamestownand never say a word to Simcoe about St. John if I let you go . " He gave a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy pose , armsfolded across his chest , did not alter . " My dear girl , Simcoe knows . That is why I am here . " " He sent you ? For St. John ? " " Somebody had to come for him . And I wanted to see you . " " You used St. John 's arrest as an excuse to  --  to  --  " She looked at him with real repugnance . " To see you , yes , " he said quietly . " Otherwise they would have sent a sergeant with a mounted guard and hauled him into a saddle with very little ceremony , I assure you . Would you have preferred it that way ? " " You will have to say you could not find him . " The pistol did not waver . " Say that he was warned and got away . " " Otherwise you will shoot me in my tracks . " His white teeth glez ned . " I  --  I would give the alarm . " " To whom ? I tell you there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save you from committing murder , I must commit a dereliction of duty , is that it ? " He moved towards her lazily and her finger stiffened on theP235trigger , but he reached for the barrel and twisted the pistol easily out of her grasp . " It would never have gone off like that , you know , " he smiled , and showed her how it had not been cocked . " Still , you meant well , did n't you ! It was very pretty , and I shall tell him you did it , I am sure he will be  --  flattered . " He replaced the pistol in his sash and swung round with a jingle of spurs and sword-belt to pick up his high crested cap from the seat of a chair . " David , wait ! " She caught at him with desperate hands . " He is badly wounded  --  he will die if he 's moved now  --  " " I am sorry . I will try to arrange for him to have good care at Ports-mouth . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead body , David . I marriedhim today ! " " You what ? " " He is my husband . " Regina drew a long breath . The wild lie had tumbled out unconsidered , and now she saw its possible advantages . Now perhaps she could keep David out of Francis Street by appealing to his kindness of heart . " He is in bed upstairs  --  very ill . M-mother is sitting with him . Do you want it on your soul that you have made me a widow ? " He stood looking down at her while astonishment gave way to comprehension . Truth seemed in every gracious line of her as she strove for the man she loved , and yet he knew that she lied . She hoped that by claiming St. John as her husband now she could save him from arrest , so long as it hung on the chivalry of a rival . And it made very little difference to David now whether the marriage ceremony had been performedor not , for he saw that she was already lost to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away quickly , back to the war , back to battle and sudden death . " It would certainly weigh heavy on my conscience , " he admitted wryly , " if I made you a widow before you were wife ! Very well , Regina  --  I leave you your bridegroom . Do you want my blessing as well ? " " Oh , David , I am grateful to you ! You wo n't  --  get into trouble ? " " I shall certainly get into very serious trouble , my dear , if anyone bothers to prove that the bird had not flown before I got here . However  --  " He set the Ranger 's leather cap with its glossy bearskin crest on his head and somehow became a foot taller . "  --  we have a few otherP236things on our minds just now ! I began the war in a green coat , " he said , standing stiffly before her , " and I shall see it out in one . Even for you , I do n't fancy myself as a deserter . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well confess that this Arnold affair stinks rather high in my nostrils . " A moment more he stood there , filling his sight with her beauty . " I find I wish you happiness in spite of myself , " he said ruefully . " God bless you , Regina . " And he was gone , with his heartbreak , down the road to Jamestown at a gallop . Bit by bit , when he was not too tired to talk , they pieced together St. John 's story . He had got to Charlotte after Gates departed for Hillsborough , and he collapsed there from loss of blood . But Cornwallis pressed close on the Camden fugitives , and St. John fled just ahead of the British entry and managed to reach Hillsborough , where Gates had set up headquarters . The wound was in the same leg as before , near the knee this time , but fortunately not in the joint . The hospital at Hillsborough hardly deservedthe name , and was cruelly over-crowded . St. John 's horror of amputation made him prefer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he applied for discharge , which Gates granted in his usual vague hurry . St. John set out from Hillsborough with a raging fever , and got nearly as far as the Virginia line and then collapsed again , outside a farmhouse where he had stopped to buy food . They took him in and nursed him with simple country remedies through weeks of fever and dysentery . The wound healed meanwhile in a sort of way , and early in December he was on the road again , riding a much restored horse which had profited by the rest but had to be coddled for lameness . Just as he approached the south bank of the James the British flotilla under Arnold began to move up the river , and he turned downstream , hoping to cross behind them . The horse had gone very lame and he left it , buying passagearound Point Comfort in the fishing-boat with his last piece of hard money.  |p237Regina  came to sit with him a little while each day , and their happinessshone round them like a second sun  --  and no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as he was able to be propped up and hold a pen he got off his report to Washington 's headquarters by a responsible courier . Then he sent for Tibby and told her the story of Camden . She listened silently , without tears . When he had finished " I do n't think he is dead , " said Tibby . " I hope you are right , " he sighed . " But why do n't you ? " Tibby turned her eyes out the window to the winter sunshine . " I just do n't feel as though he is dead , " she said . " The sun goes on shining , child , no matter who dies . " " Not in my heart , " she told him . " If he could n't ever come back  --  things would feel emptier . He is some place  --  he is alive  --  or I would know . " " Sometimes I wish you did n't love him quite so much , " St. John said very gently , so that she hardly realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think perhaps if you love a person enough , it can come between them and harm , " she explained earnestly . " But if you are going to do that , you ca n't save out anything for yourself . It must n't matter what happens to you  --  so long as they are all right . That is what I have tried to do for Mr. Day , " she added simply . " I am his ransom out of the pit . I never ask God 's mercy for myself  --  only for him . " " Tibby , I am fond of him too . But no man deserves all that . " " He wo n't know , " she said , as though that excused it . " Well , he ought to know ! " St. John cried impatiently . " He ought to be able to see  --  ! " And then he remembered Dorothea , and fell silent . " He never sees things like that . He does n't even know about your sister , " said Tibby , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are people made of glass , to you ? I suppose you must know too that he is in love with Regina ! " " Oh , well , " said Tibby apologetically . " She is so beautiful . Miss Dorothea is beautiful too , so it does n't seem fair , but I do n't think he has ever realized how beautiful she is . Perhaps he will when he comes back and finds Miss Regina married to you . " " And are you resigned to that ? " he queried curiously . " Miss Dorothea would n't mind if I see him sometimes . So it wouldn't be very different than it has always been . " But her eyes filled as she said it . " Tibby , come here to me . " St. John leaned towards her impulsively , and held out one hand . " Is n't there something I can do ? " She looked back at him gravely , her hand in his  --  the girl who never asked mercy for herself . " Do n't mind the way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't hold it against him . " " I know what you mean , " he said solemnly . " And I promise not to let it make any difference at all . " When she had gone he sat a long time with his pipe , turning things over in his mind . In spite of himself he was somehow surer than he had been that Julian would come back . And then what ? As spring came on , it was very evident that the British intended to try and finish the war in Virginia as soon as possible , and that Washingtonmeant to eliminate Arnold from his Portsmouth stronghold . In April Lafayette began his southward march , and almost simultaneously Cornwallis left his base at Wilmington with a recuperated force to join Phillips , who had superseded Arnold in the British command in Virginia . Williamsburg was always delectable in May , and Tibby felt a lift to her heart which no amount of alarms and anxiety could quite dispel . Her mother was ailing and frail , and Tibby had taken over most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scented soap which brought in enough money to keep the little householdrunning . Kit took such odd jobs as slave labor left to him , and received in payment bits of food or some garden seed or a nearly worthless piece of paper money , from people who mostly just wanted to be kind . Mawes did a day 's fishing or carpentry now and then , and drank the proceeds . She had not known how to tell St. John the half of her belief in Julian 's safety . What had begun as a pathetic sort of game , played to stave off desolation after his departure , had now become an article of faith . For years she had never walked down the Duke of Gloucester Stiret without the hope of meeting him . And now out of her need she contrived the comforting pretence of living each day as though heP239was just around the corner . Each day she learned from the books he had given her , and set herself new tasks of memory and penmanship and needlework . And not a flower bloomed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it in her secret way , holding him fast at her side in his absence as she had never done in reality . It brought him nearer , it kept him safer , if she never , for a single twenty-four hours , acknowledged to herself that he was not there . If she loved him enough ... . On a warm afternoon in May she went scuffing through the dust of the Duke of Gloucester Street with a basket on her arm  --  she had deliveredthree beautifully laundered fichus and a gauze apron and some caps to Mrs. Greensleeves , whose personal maid was ill , and besides the payment in coin she had received a small sponge cake which was for her mother 's supper . Sarah had felt too faint to finish the ironing and Tibby had done it for her , and put the corn bread in the oven to bake before she left the cabin . As she passed the Raleigh on her way home , Mr. Southall looked round from a conversation with a couple of friends at the hitching-bar and shouted at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basket ! What 's your name ? " She smiled back at him with her usual self-possession , for all three of them were known to her and had teased her ever since she could remember . " I 'm Tibby Mawes , " she answered gaily . " It 's ' bout time you learned that , is n't it ? " " You are , are you ! " said the inn-keeper with affection , and winked at his cronies . " Well , suppose I was to have a letter come addressed to Mistress Tabitha Mawes  --  would you have any idea who it was meant for ? " " A letter ? " she said , rooted . " From Richmond , as ever is . It 's right on that table inside the door , you might look and see if it would be for you . " She hurried into the tavern and found the letter  --  addressed in the fine , ornate hand of the schoolmaster . The world was rocking round her as she carried it out again and blindly passed the grinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she could be alone .   She set the basket on a table-tomb just inside the gate and broke the seal of Julian 's letter with fingers that shook . Mistress Tabitha Mauves on the outside just like a lady . But inside  --  Dear Tibby . She steadied herself against the cold tomb  --  even her knees were shaking now  --  he was alive  --  he was safe  --  and he had written to tell her so . Dear TibbyThis is the first time I have had an opportunity to send of a letter which had any hope of reaching you , and I am not sure about this one , but a post-bag is leaving and I must try to let you know that I am not lost entirely . You were very nearly rid of me forever after Camden , Tibby , but thanks to General Marion I am alive to tell the tale , which I shall do at pitiless length when next I see you . But I was n't much good to him after he had gone to all that trouble , so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I witnessedthe battle of Guilford Courthouse last March . But General Greene did n't have much use for me either , if you can believe such a thing , and he sent me to General Lafayette , who was then coming down towards Richmond . Although the Marquis speaks English till all is blue , General Steuben still has some difficulty , and they allege that an aide who can be as intelligent in either French or German as he ever is in English is not to be sneezed at . The Marquis is short of aides and secretaries in any language , so it looks as though he might be able to bear with me till he can get something better , especially as a great deal of his correspondence is with General Greene and they both believe  --  without much cause  --  that I understand conditions in Carolina , etc . You would be surprised at the amount of letter-writing it takes to fight a war . We have gone into a sort of headquarters at Wilton , which is a plantation a few miles outside of Richmond  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I assure you , and will soon be in our midst , and I trust most cordially received . I saw him once , think of that  --  at Camden it was , when he did me the honor to name me his prisoner , along with General de Kalb and other members of the Quality . He is an impressive man , and was most polite about it too , but he carries a little too much weight for this climate . The idea now is to amuse him and await reinforcements . Wep241have got so we can do that sort of thing in our sleep . I do n't know how you could get a letter back to me , but I would like one very much , my dear , you may be sure of that . It is nearly a year since we said good-bye that evening at the Landing , and I have thought of it many times  --  Thou shalt not be afraid , you said , but I have been , bless you , I have been frightened almost out of my boots more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tibby , I always suspected that and now I know ! Sweetheart , I have saved the worst till the last , but I do n't see how I can dodge telling you that I saw your St. John at Camden , and since then I have not been able to find out what became of him . Perhaps you know by now , and I pray that you do , and that he is safe . I shall send a letter to Francis Street in this same bag , but in case it should never arrive there you had better go round and tell them this much if they have not heard from him . I wish I could add something for your comfort  --  and my own . Try not to hate poor Miss Regina out of love for him . They were made for each other , and in her heart she knows it . Sometimes I think the army has made a philosopher out of me at last . Perhaps it is because we never have quite enough to eat . Please present my affectionate regards to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always your devoted servant , JULIAN DAYWhen she had read it ravenously for the third time , some of its less obvious implications began to penetrate the roseate haze which envelopedthe churchyard . What , in fact , was all this about Mr. Sprague ? She read it again , and it failed again to make any sense whatever . Tibby straightened her hat , picked up her basket , and set out for Francis Street . She found St. John alone in the drawing-room , and saw by his face as soon as she entered that the other letter from Julian had arrived safely . " You have heard from Mr. Day too , " she said , and her eyes were radiant , for his smile confirmed her own boundless relief and joy . " Yes , thank God ! Dorothea and Aunt Anabel are upstairs crying over the letter . " He had risen , still with some effort because of his wound , to greet her  --  there would be a halt in his step all the rest of hisP242life , but he hoped soon to rejoin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chair with his usual exquisite formality . But Tibby stood in front of him , the letter clasped to her childish bosom , looking puzzled and embarrassed . " Mr. Sprague  --  may I speak to you about a very private matter , please ? " " Why , yes , my dear , anything you like , of course . " " One time when I was here you sort of took me by surprise and I  --  told you how I loved him . " " Yes , child . But I had known that for some time . " " You had ? " She was surprised . " Have you ever spoken of it to him ? " " Why , no  --  not really . Why do you ask that ? " " Well , I do n't think he knows . Because you see  --  he seems to think it is you ! " she blurted and grew pink before his astonishment . " But that is ridiculous ! " cried St. John , and then was a little hurt at her prompt agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got this game legBut Tibby unfolded the letter and read aloud to him very fast the paragraph which ended with the injunction not to hate Regina . " There , you see ? " she added . " Now , why should he think I mind what you do ? " " Certainly , why indeed ! " said St. John with just a trace of bitterness . " It is perfectly plain you would boil my head to make soup for his supperany day ! The man is a fool ! Would you mind letting me read that again  --  slowly ? " She let him take the letter , pointing out the place on the page . He read it in silence , and  --  " Fool ! " he said vehemently again as he handed it back to her . " Oh , how like him that is ! Why do we put up with him , Tibby ? Why do you bother with such half-wittedness ? Shall I write down a piece of my mind and send it to him ? " " There is no way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else had occurred to her . " I remember now  --  the night before he went away , down by the Landing even that night he must have thought it was you . Because if he had n't  --  " She stopped , and folded up the letter in fingers that were quite steady now . If he had n't thought she suffered from the same malady as his own he would never have leaned against her there on the bridge for mutual comfort . It was his belief that her need of St. John matched his for Regina in hopelessness that hadP243brought him into her arms . She folded the letter again and again , and gave a little sigh , and then smiled up into St. John 's troubled face . " Oh , well , " she said , " it would n't matter anyhow , if he knew the rights of it . I do n't mind if you do n't . " " I am going to try to get a letter through to him somehow  --  just to say that I am still here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in it ? " " Yes , thank you , I will bring it round this evening . But I would rather you did n't say anything to him about  --  about this . It would n't do for him to know that I told you what was in his letter . " " He would n't have to know . I could say  --  " " I would rather you did n't , " she said again with her quaint dignity , and the door opened before Dorothea , who had obviously been crying and was nevertheless a little more radiant than anybody . Tibby beheld Dorothea 's translucent happiness with an almost maternalsmile , and said yes , it was wonderful news , and she must go now because of the sponge cake and her mother feeling so poorly and the corn bread in the oven  --  and then escaped into the street . But as she walked home , with the folded letter warm in her fingers and the sun hanging low and golden over the treetops , there was no room after all in her heart for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and safe with Lafayette and had taken the trouble to write to her . Before she had got as far as the Capitol she was trying not to run , because she was almost grown up now , but she hurriedso there would be time to read the letter to her mother before Kit got home  --  Mr. Day sent his affectionate regards to her mother  --  that was because of the time she nursed him through the fever , and the time he paid for the doctor when she had it so bad herself , and the time she had n't been too proud to ask him to buy the cough mixture for Kit , and the mending she did for him , going through his things when he was n't there so he would n't have a chance to offer to pay . . . . As Tibby reached the cabin door the smell of burning corn bread met her , and she ran to the oven and jerked out the pan  --  the loaf was a blackened crisp . With a sudden sharp presentiment she called and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she saw the blue dress skirt across the bed .   Sarah Mawes lay flung down on the white cotton counterpane , her full skirt and one work-worn hand trailing to the floor . " Oh , mother , I should n't have gone out , you said you were feeling better  --  ! " She went to the bedside , picked up Sarah 's hand , pressed Julian 's letter into the cold fingers . " Mother , we have heard from Mr. Day at last , he is safe with L  --  Mother ! " The letter slipped to the floor . A chill from the hand she held ran up Tibby 's arm to her heart . She had never seen death before , but the feel of death was unmistakable to her young flesh . She dropped the hand , which no longer had any familiarity to her touch . " Oh , Kit , come quick  --  Kit , get the doctor ! " But at the door she paused , and hung there an instant , undecided  --  for Kit was down the Creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear her call . Besides , it was too late for the doctor . Her mother was dead  --  quietly as she would have wished it , without making anybody any trouble  --  but just too soon to hear the letter , and it would have made such a difference to her to know for sure that Mr. Day was safe .... The room was darkening as the sun went down , shadows were closing in around the lonely figure on the bed . She stood looking down at her mother from the doorway , trying to realize that it was not a stranger who lay there , and therefore not a frightening presence . She must not run for Kit now , she must stay here till he came . Her mother , who had died alone , must not be left again , now that she had no further need of company . The house was very still in the twilight  --  very empty , for Tibby was alone in it as she had never been before . She turned back slowly to the bedside . Slowly her knees bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue skirt beside that cold hanging hand , and slowly the tears came . At last , spent with sobbing that seemed to her to reverberate through the darkening room , she strove again for composure , for Kit 's sake , and to steady herself began to try to think clearly " I should have waited till Kit got back before I went to Mrs. Greensleeves  --  " she whispered , forcing her stiff lips to form words again . " I should never have left her alone like that  --  I thought she felt better  --  she said she did  --  Mrs. Greensleeves gave me a cake for her supper  --  I should have brought it straight home  --  Oh , mother , the letter was atp245the Raleigh , I wanted you to know  --  I was going to read it to you , every word , before Kit came  --  I should never have gone back to Francis Street , or I might have been in time  --  in time to tell you his message  --  listen to the letter , mother , I 'll read it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hear  --  " On her knees beside the bed , her wet cheek resting on the blue skirt , she reached for the letter , where it had fallen and unfolded it tenderly in the dimming light , and began to read it aloud  --  unevenly , with gaps between the words where her breath gave out  --  because wherever her mother was now she might still hear and be comforted that they had been right all along , and nothing had happened to him . . . . Dear Tibby  --  This is the first time I have had an opportunity to send off a letter which had any hope of reaching you , and I am not sure about this one  --  but a post-bag is leaving and I must try to let you know  --  that I am not lost entirely ... . There was a little silence in the drawing-room in Francis Street when Tibby had gone , and then Dorothea said " Sinjie , has it ever occurred to you that Tibby might be in love with Julian when she grows up ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he admitted doubtfully and turned away for his pipe , but Dorothea never needed to see his face clearly to read his mind . " It has happened already , " she said , and caught her breath . " Why , of course  --  I might have known  --  she is in love with him ! " " Well , even if she is , he has n't an idea . " " He thinks of her as a child still . And of course she is  --  but by the time he comes back from the war  --  " " My dear , do n't let 's cross bridges . " But she stood there , staring towards his voice , which was as though he had failed to meet her eyes . " How old is Tibby now ? " she asked quietly , and he sighed .   " Tibby is sixteen . I seem to be the only one who can see it . " " Yes  --  sixteen  --  of course she is , " repeated Dorothea , stricken with revelation at last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she owes everything to him , and he has always been all wrapped up in her . Some day very soon he will realize that . " " Dorothea , you are borrowing trouble , child , we do n't know yet how things will work out . On the last reports it was Regina he was in love with , do n't forget that ! " " Yes , but then , everybody is ! " she smiled bravely . " Sinjie , when are you and Regina going to be married ? " " When the war is over . " " But Regina is ready now . She would go to the church with you tomorrow . Especially if you are going back to the army  --  " " When the war is over , I said , " he reiterated firmly . " When I am sure to keep all my arms and legs . Not before . " She saw that his mind was made up , and not even Regina could change it then . And soon she slipped away to her room upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I must learn to do withoutJulian , she told herself quite steadily , shedding no more tears . I must learn to stop wishing and hoping . The quicker I learn , the easier it will be . And I will learn not to think about him ... . Julian had chosen in his letter to belittle his appointment to Lafayette 's military family , but actually he had been received into it with open arms , after a roundabout journey to avoid Phillips at Petersburg and Arnold at Chesterfield Courthouse , joining Lafayette a day 's march above Richmond . He carried letters from Greene , whom Lafayette loved next to Washington , and one of them spoke highly of the courier who brought it , which naturally predisposed the Marquis in Julian ' ! favor . A few minutes ' conversation in French made them friends . Julian was still wearing the disgraceful remnants of the British coat and breeches in which he had left Snow 's Island , and had to be clothed by donation from Lafayette 's officers . Only the Marquis had legs long enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wais coat , linen , lace jabot and black solitaire , stockings , boots , and even a queue ribbon that was not all frayed , were requisitioned from the family and Julian stood at last in respectable Continental blue and buff , leftP247over from the lavish outfitting which Lafayette had done the year beforeat his own expense for his own corps . They even found him a sword , and when his captain 's commission came through , to match the single epaulet on the right shoulder of the coat , he felt that now he was really a soldier . The aide 's green ribbon slanting across his breast , fastened in place by Lafayette himself , crowned his satisfaction . " And now , " said Lafayette , banging him on the shoulder with affec-. tion , " we shall win the war ! " But for the time their chief concern was to keep out of Cornwallis ' reach till General Wayne could join them with his Pennsylvanians . Lafayette remarked that he was at the moment not even strong enough to get beaten . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Point of Fork camp , with Steuben to guard them , and the Virginia legislature had already removed to Charlottesville . Cornwallis had received further reinforcements from New York , and now commanded about seven thousand men , outnumbering Lafayette more than three to one . In order to prevent himself from being cut off from his rendezvous with Wayne or from the stores , Lafayette kept falling back in a more or less parallel line to the north and west of Cornwallis ' advance , destroyingbridges and felling trees across the roads behind him . Tarleton'sinevitable dragoons were often uncomfortably close on his heels . The old cat-and-mouse game which Cornwallis and Greene had played through the Carolinas had begun again , this time with Lafayette as the American quarry . And while the Marquis maneuvered with great skill from river to river , the British burned warehouses and took civilian prisoners and stores almost at will . Then , as before , there came a point where Cornwallis must abandon the chase and become the pursued , as he in turn retreated towards his coastal communications and supplies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Wayne and Steuben to the total of two thousand Continentals , not including militia and a rather informal cavalry corps of Virginians riding their own blood mounts , Lafayette followed warily across the Chickahominy and down the Neck , never coming near enough for battle , never quite losing touch . Williamsburg sat there in the glory of its June heat and roses , and watched Cornwallis approach . He was at Bird 's Tavern on the twentyfourth , Cooper 's Mill on the twenty-fifth , Spencer 's Ordinary on thep248twenty-sixth  --  there was nothing to stop him , and Lafayette drove him nearer each day . Williamsburg remembered the shelling of Norfolk , and the hangings at Charleston , and the fires at Manchester and Richmond , and its residents looked at each other with tense , blanched faces . Those who could began to send their womenfolk out of the town by water from the College Landing on Archer 's Hope Creek , where fishing-boats could be hired . After some hesitation , Regina 's father decided that his wife and daughters would be safer at Farthingale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British army 's path , especially as , if Lafayette kept on coming , there would have to be a battle on the Neck . St. John had gone north again at the end of May , before Cornwallis turned back towards the coast , and supposedly he was with Washington in Connecticut . Mrs. Greensleeves implored Aunt Anabel to remove Dorothea from the neighborhood of the soldiery by accompanying her own family to Farthingale , and insisted that St. John would never expose his sister to the horrors of a British occupation of Williamsburg . On June twenty-seventh , with the spectacular scarlet column bearing down on the town from the north like conquerors , drums beating and banners flying , while a fishing-boat waited at the College Landing with the Greensleeves ' luggage already on board , Aunt Anabel suddenly gave in . But first she sent Joshua with the coach full tilt to the cabin by the Queen 's Creek Landing to collect the twins , declaring that she could never look Julian in the face again if she left them behind . Tibby came to the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to lose , and she was n't to bring any baggage , they were just to come in whatever they stood up in . " I ca n't go , " she said , when he had finished . " Kit is sick . " " How sick ? I carry him , " said Joshua efficiently . " He has been in bed two days  --  he ca n't eat , and it hurts him to move  --  he could never stand a journey . " " Fever ? Lemme look . " Joshua bent his massive form to pass beneath the cabin lintel and stood above the bed . He laid a gentle black hand on Kit 's head , while Kit looked back at him blankly , without recognition . " It ca n't be the smallpox , because Mr. Day had us inoculated , " said Tibby from the other side of the bed . " We ate some berries yesterday  --  maybe they were n't good for us . I feel kind of queer myself . He ca n't keep anything down . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of folks awful unhealthy right now . " " He had been doing so well , " she sighed . " He had n't been sick since March . And then this had to happen . We ca n't move him . " " Do n't look like it , " Joshua conceded doubtfully . " Coach awful full . He was supposed ride up on the box with me . " " You will have to tell them I ca n't leave him , " said Tibby . " And thank them very much for thinking of us . I was going to ask Dr. Graves to come and see him  --  " " Dr. Graves done gone to the army . Do n't know who you could git now , to doctor him . " " Then I must just pull him through myself , " she said resolutely . " We 'll be all right here , there is nothing the British want of us . " " Mebbe so , " said Joshua unhappily . " Sure is too bad . Here  --  you take this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hoarded piece of hard money and pressed it into her hand . " You take that , case food is hard to git . " " Thank you , Joshua  --  I will pay it back some time . " " Do n't need worry about that . I wo n't have no call for it , do n't suppose . " He stooped again under the low lintel and out into the sunshine , " Boat ca n't wait no longer , I 'm ' fraid . Just you lie low , " he said comfortingly . " Gineral Lafayette chase ' em out again , you wait ! Gineral Lafayette at Tyre 's plantation now  --  less'n twenty mile up the Neck , that is , beyond Spencer 's . You wait ! " Kit was calling for water as she turned back from the doorway . She laid the money on the table and went to the well to draw a fresh bucket . He held to her with hot dry hands and begged her not to leave him again . She was still sitting beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweating with terror . He had , as usual , been drinking . " The British are coming ! " he cried . " They just keep on coming , bloody thousands of ' em ! They 'll be in the town by morning ! Pretty soon we ca n't get past ' em on the road to the other Landing ! " He began fumblingly to gather together a few things into a bundle . " You know what Tarleton does ? He pins you to your own door with a bayonet and burns the house over your head ! Gim me some food , whatever there is  --  I 'm gettin ' out of here ! " " There is corn bread on the dresser , " she said tonelessly . " Kit is sick . " " Sick , eh ! Been stealin ' fruit again , no doubt ! What 's this ? " He snatched up the coin from the table . " Joshua left it for Kit . You ca n't take it , it 's for Kit ! " She flew at him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dumped the half loaf of corn bread into the bundle on top of a spare shirt and some tools . " Now , listen , you  --  I 've hid the horse down by the Creek , where those willows are  --  you know the place . I 'm goin ' by water , three of us got a boat . But I want you to see to the horse , understand ? Go down and let him drink and tie him to a different tree each day , so he can graze . Mind nobody sees you go , leave it till dusk . Then the British wo n't find him and when the bastards are gone we 'll have a horse but nobody else will ! Do n't forget him , now . I 'll be back when those lobstershave left . " He was off at a shambling run , with his bundle . Drearily she got out the bag of corn meal and began to make up another loaf of bread . Kit could n't keep it down . She would try to beg a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make some gruel . All night she sat beside Kit , wringing out cool cloths , patiently answeringhis random talk , while her own sickness held off and finally receded as though by sheer effort of her will . Whatever it was , Kit had got it worse than she had , as usual . Whatever it was , her own hardiness fought for her , while she ministered to him . The British marched in next morning , down the road past the College , not with fire and sword after all , because Cornwallis needed the town , and there was no resistance . But they took possession very thoroughly and made themselves at home without any consideration for the townsfolk . As evening fell there was a tramping of feet down the path outside the cabin door , and a big sweating man in a red coat with blue facings stepped without ceremony into the kitchen . " Hulloa , the house ! " he bellowed . " Look sharp , now ! Who 's at home ? " Receiving no reply , he stamped on into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kit tossed and moaned . She looked back at him , rigid with fear , but silent , her chin out . For a moment he stood staring at her , and then said , " Somebody sick , missy ? " " My brother . " " You all alone ? " " Yes , sir . What do you want ? " " Something wet to drink . Buckets of it . " " There is a well at the back . You can help yourself . " He leaned his bayoneted musket against the doorjamb and came to the bedside . Tibby shrank back protectively , covering Kit as best she could . " Now , now , we do n't make war on children , " the soldier said brusquely . " I wo n't hurt him . Might be I 'd know what to do . " He turned back the sheet and felt Kit 's hot body , forced open his black , swollen mouth to look at his tongue , and shook his head . " It 's bad , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he eat rotten food maybe ? " " I do n't know . He may have got something . He ca n't hold anything on his stomach any more . " " That 's weakening , " said the soldier . " Tell you what , missy , I 'd ask the apothecary for something to stop the vomiting if I was you . " " I have n't any money . And the doctor is gone . And I did n't dare go into town for fear I might not get back . " " Because of us ? " The soldier seemed hurt . " Bless you , we 'd never harm a bit of a thing like you , minding her own business , and that . Tell you what , missy , I just finished me sentry-go at the bridge and I 've got an hour or so . You fetch me a nice drink of cold water and I 'll set here as a kind of hostage , you might say , and cool off , while you run along to the apothecary and tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all I 've got left , but he 'll give you something for that if you tell him how it is . " Tibby accepted the penny with astonishment . " You are very kind , sir . I never knew  --  " " Oh , we ai n't such a bad lot , us Fusiliers . I had a boy of me own , once . Get along , now , but fetch me that water before you go . And if you have any trouble , look for these blue facings , see  --  and tell ' em you 're a friend of Phineas Jones . "  | " Thank you , sir . I 'll come back as fast as I can . " But the apothecary 's shop had been stripped of its remedies by the British quartermaster , and the clerk who sat among the ruins was unable to help her , though he was hysterically full of tales of the disasters wrought by the British on the town . The streets were crowded with red-faced , swaggering soldiers , and hardly an inhabitant was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just at dusk , to find Phineas Jones dozing beside the bed and Kit in a stupor . " Here is the penny back , sir . " She held it out in a damp little palm . " There was nothing left in the shop . " " Tck-tck , " said the Fusilier and rose and stretched himself . " Well , that 's how it is . No , you keep it , missy , I 'll have more coming to me soon . Might come in handy to you . " " That 's very good of you , sir , " she said forlornly , trying not to cry for sheer weariness and despair . " Where 's all your menfolks , missy ? With the army ? " " I have a  --  a friend with General Lafayette , " she told him with a certainpride . " Oh , my , that 's bad , that is , " said the Fusilier sympathetically . " Lafayettedo n't have a hope now . You might as well make up your mind to that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tibby 's chin stuck out . " Well , we ai n't really got round to it yet , that 's all . Remember Cam-den ? " " Gates was n't any much of a general , they say . But Lafayette is dif-ferent . " " Oh , pshaw , missy , I could take the Marquis over my knee any day ! You 'll see ! " " W-will there be a battle here ? " " Think likely , hereabouts . Tell you what , missy , if you want that feller of yours to live to marry you , best you get him away from Lafayetteany way you can , and the sooner the better . Just you take that as a friendly warning , so to speak , because I happen to feel kindly towards you . Once we get squared around and really start in on those dirty , half-starved scarecrows the Frenchman calls an army , we 'll eat ' em alive , and it wo n't be a pretty sight , I 'm tellin ' you straight . And it might come sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missy , andP253good luck to you , I 'm sure ! " he added benevolently , as he collected his musket from the doorway and clumped out . The cabin was very still when he had left it , except for Kit 's breathing , which had become heavy and uneven . She sat beside him steadfastlyin the light of a single candle , bathing his wrists and temples , fanning his flushed , feverish face , fighting panic and a cruel loneliness  --  with the persistent , piercing , sweet song of the tree-frogs in her ears . She never heard them now that she did not remember that evening on the bridge above the Landing , and Julian Day leaning on the rail with his face against her shoulder and her cheek against his hair . It did n't matter any more why he had come to her , or what he believed her to be suffering too  --  it only mattered that once he had been there , in her arms , and nothing could ever take that away from her in a hundred years ... . About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left her faint and shaking as she tried to hold him . When he was gone , she knelt a long time beside the bed , dry-eyed and exhausted , her forehead restingagainst the mattress . She tried to pray and found that she was prayingless to God , who was nebulous and far , than to Julian Day , who was as near as Lafayette . And then the tears came , and she wept hopelessly , not so much for the loss of her brother as from need of the man who might never love her as a woman but whose presence in her sight was all that held the sun in the heavens . At last she was quiet and heard the first sleepy bird-notes before the summer dawn , while the obsession grew and grew that she must see him somehow , that if only she could tell him  --  tell him what ? That with her mother dead , and now Kit , she stood alone and in desperate need of his protection ? He would take care of her , of course  --  he always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her anything . But he was a man , and unmarried , and how would it look , now that she was grown ? If she had been Kit it would be different . A man could adopt a boy without embarrassment . Kit could have lived with him forever , unquestioned , and not made him any trouble . But it was Kit who had to die .... The candle had guttered down into a pool of wax and was sputtering and smoking feebly . She raised her head , trying to see out of eyes which were puffy from weeping and lack of sleep , her head ringing with fatigue , her body racked and gnawing with hunger . Automatically , she wet finger and thumb with her tongue and reached to snuff the candle  --  her hand paused there in mid-air , short of its mission  --  she knelt , giddy and incredulous , staring at the chair beside the bed where Kit 's clothes lay folded in a neat pile , while her numb brain fumbled at a dazzling idea ... . While she contemplated the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not her own , the candle gave a final gasp and went out . The window pane was barely grey , the birds had not really begun , but the British drums were sounding reveille in the town . Tibby rose from her knees . With quick hands , suddenly competent and steady , she lighted another candle and began to do the things she had to do . The sun was not yet over the treetops when a figure which might have been Kit rose from kneeling beside a mound of freshly turned earth at the rear of the cabin , shouldered a small bundle , and turned away towards the bank of the Creek where Crowsmeat was hidden . Behind her , without a backward look , she left Kit 's body in the shallow grave she herself had scratched out with a pick-ax and shovel . It wore a sheet for a shroud , and above it was a makeshift wooden cross into which she had burned her own name with a hot poker : Tabitha Mawes . They were changing the guard at the bridge  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prrresent arms !  --  Rrrecover arm s !  --  Frrront face ! "  --  as she crawled through the bushes on the bank until a bend in the Creek hid her from their sight . She found Crowsmeat among the willows and he whickered with pleasure at her approach . The saddle was still in the woodshed behind the cabin , and it was too heavy for her to handle alone anyway , but an old blanket which sometimes protectedhim from flies and rain was folded on the ground under the trees . She laid it across his bony back as a pad  --  it would be more comfortablethan riding him bareback  --  and climbed on to a fallen log and mounted with difficulty from there.  |p255The  woods on that side of the town were well known to her , for she and Kit had always quartered them several times a year in search of myrtle for candlewax and edible berries and wild fruit and birds ' eggs . The Creek was wide there , and her way was soon blocked by a marshy stream which joined the larger one just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tide to go down before she could ford it , and then bore westward , intending to intersect the road from the east somewhere beyond the last British picket at the College end of the town . Joshua had said that Tyre 's plantation was beyond Spencer'sOrdinary , which everyone knew was on the north road to Richmond . The going was very rough , and sometimes she had to dismount and lead or coax the unwilling Crowsmeat through the tangled undergrowth . When she was on foot branches caught at her bundle and hooked the blanket from Crowsmeat 's back so that she had to go back and search for it . She had no way to carry water , and suffered from thirst as the long hot day passed its meridian . She had brought corn bread in the bundle , and she ate what fruit she could find along the way to make her own provisions last . It was slow work , with many rests for Crowsmeat and a hunt for drinking water , and darkness found her somewhere north of the town and still short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground with the blanket wrapped around her against the damp , and Crowsmeat tied to a nearby tree , and woke in the dawn to the recurrent problem of mounting him on top of the slippery blanket without stirrups . She nearly encountered a picket on the road after all , but his back was turned and leading Crowsmeat a step at a time she retreated breathlesslythrough the undergrowth and escaped his notice . The next time she approached the road it was empty , and she turned into it with relief and pressed on northward up the Neck . Twice during the day she dodged into the bushes and held Crowsmeat 's nose while small parties of British horsemen went by , and once she circled out into the woods to avoid passing through the little settlement around ChickahominyChurch . The detours ate up time , and Crowsmeat 's pace was always stately , co she spent a second night in the woods beyond Spencer 's Ordinary and made a breakfastless start in the dawn . By now she had had leisure to contemplate the various aspects of the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should come back to see how Kit was . If he found the cross behind the cabin he would be confused , but to anyone else the story of Tibby 's death would pass muster . Luckily she had mentioned to Joshua that she felt queer  --  so when Aunt Anabel must be faced again it would only be necessary to say that Kit had got better and Tibby had got worse and died  --  with a little uncertainty as to the exact day when it happened . Of course Kit , if he had lived , would have been a man soon  --  he would have had to shave , that is , and his voice would have got deeper . It was easy enough to counterfeit Kit now , but how about when he should have come of age , what would be expected of him , and how long would it be beforeWell , it was no good worrying about that now . The British army was in Williamsburg in all its might and glory  --  big , swaggering , confident , beery men in red coats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops , taking over people 's houses for officers ' quarters , able in their magnificent stride to toss a penny to a sick boy  --  they did n't make war on children , the Fusilier said  --  no , but they made war on Virginia , and what chance had gentlemen like Julian Day or St. John Sprague , or even General Lafayette himself , against these burly conquerors who laid out their horse lines all through the town and overran even the churchyard and the College ? This was the army which had taken Charleston and hanged people right and left , the army that had burned and pillaged and murdered through Georgia and the Carolinas . And now it came to a stand at Williamsburg , with Lafayette moving towards his fate . Perhaps she would be in time to tell Mr. Day what the Fusilier had said , and he could tell Lafayette  --  but Lafayette must already know . There would be a battle on the Neck , everybody said . Cornwallis expected the British fleet to come into Yorktown at his back , and Lafayette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all died , and then it would be Washington 's turn , up north . The world was on fire , the world might be coming to an end , but in the meantime she would see Julian Day again , and if there was a battle she would be in it too . Because if Julian Day had to die that way , she must die too , beside him , where she belonged.  |p257She  tried to plan what she must say to him , as she rode . Neither she nor Kit had ever lied to him before  --  unless you could count those other three times she had worn Kit 's clothes and nobody had noticed till she broke the ewer . Tibby is dead , she must say as soon as she got to him  --  and she had brought along the doll in her bundle to prove it . Tibby is dead . The words had a queer taste on her tongue . I am dead , and this is my brother , who never felt about Julian Day quite the way I do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kit when I see him . Kit would be fairly off-hand about it , if he had left me under the cross and come to Tyre 's plantation . Kit was so ashamed of his own weakness he always pretended to be much more off-hand than he felt . He wanted so much to be manly and strong  --  but the least little thing always made him cry . I should have been the boy , they said  --  they said I had all the guts . Reckon I 'll need them now ... . Tibby is dead , Mr. Day . How would Kit have said that ? Not too off-hand , he could never have managed it . And mother too  --  he would have to say that mother died in May . Mr. Day had never answered the letter Mr. Sprague sent , and Aunt Anabel said it obviously had never got to him . He will be sorry about mother , he sent her his affectionate regards . Can I tell him about mother without crying ? Well , anyway , I do n't think Kit could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plantation , will they want to look in my bundle ? I can say it is my sister 's doll  --  but a girl has to have things in her bundle that a boy does n't need  --  if they look in the bundle I 'll never get to him  --  if they find out I am a girl before I get to him ... . She avoided Cooper 's Mill and returned to the road beyond it , and with her heart in her mouth rode boldly up to the American picket outsideTyre 's plantation . " Whoa , there , " he said , and eyed the small straight figure atop the decrepit horse with friendly amusement . " Where might you be bound for , sonny ? " " Please , sir , I want to see General Lafayette , " she announced . " Ye do n't say ! Anything special , or just a social call ? " " It is very special , sir . " " Cornwallis send you ? " he grinned . " No , sir . But I come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me ! " marvelled the sentry , only half believing . " Ai n't they got no pickets out ? " " There was one in the road but he did n't see me . You would n't have a bit of breakfast left over , would you ? " He looked at her pale lips and sunken eyes , and the horse which stood splay-legged with fatigue . " Well , no , I would n't , I et it all , such as it was , " he confessed regretfully . " But I tell you what you do , son , you go on into camp and tell ' em you 're hungry and see what happens . Tell the fellow at the gate Jim said you could go in . He 's a friend of mine . " " Thank you , sir . " She rode on , smiling back at him over her shoulder , for the encounter had raised her confidence . He had n't suspected anything . It was going to be all right . Roll call and inspection were over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the cook-fires hung low on the still , hot air , and there was the smell of soup-pots and horse lines , as well as a whiff from the sinks at the rear . Blacksmiths were musically at work , and a drummer-boy was practicing his roll under the colors planted in front of an adjutant 's tent , while a couple of his fellows looked on critically . It was all surprisingly peaceful-looking , for a war . Instead of turning Crowsmeat 's head towards the smoke of the fires on the left , she followed the wide , tree-lined avenue which led from the gate to the brick mansion whose stout pink chimneys were visible through the trees . Half way up the drive she slid to the ground , adjusted the blanket tidily on the horse 's back , and took the halter . No one had yet accosted her bundle . Leading the aged horse , walking close against his nose for the couragehis indifference to his surroundings lent her , she approached headquarters . General Lafayette was somewhere behind that handsome white-painted doorway , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods , she looked mussed and shabby and sparrow-like enough ; ; . to pass for Kit anywhere , though they were his best clothes she wore  --  a brown holland coat and breeches , a tan-colored waistcoat , white cotton stockings , black shoes and a black tricorne . The white linen shirt had been fresh when she put it on but it needed laundering now , and the starched frill and cravat were limp and soiled . She had cutP259her straight dark hair to shoulder length and tied it back with a black ribbon into a queue like Kit 's . A sentry paced up and down in front of the house along the gravelled drive , and a Negro groom sat on the bottom step with the reins of two waiting horses dangling in his hands . On the scarred and trodden lawn at the edge of the drive a group of lounging riflemen wearing buckskin hunting-shirts with fringes , like trappers , watched with idle interest while the forlorn little figure paused in the sentry 's path as he came towards her . " Is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politely . " Run along , bub , " said the sentry , and passed her without breaking his step . " You got an appointment with the general , sonny ? " a rifleman called to her , and raised a laugh among his friends . " Is he inside the house ? " she demanded hopefully . " Sure , so is General Washington ! We 're waitin ' to see the parade go by ! " She knew they were fooling her , because General Washington was in Connecticut , as anybody could tell you . The broad white door of the house stood open to the summer heat . Tibby 's eyes measured the distance between it and herself , between herself and the sentry . Then her with an oath , the Negro groom grabbed at thin air too late . On the threshold she crashed into the waistcoat of an officer who was coming out . He plucked her out of his buff facings and sword-belt and held her , his fingers biting deep . " What 's this ? " he said sharply , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm looking for Mr. Day , sir , he is with General Lafayette , " she got out all in one breath . " How do you know he is ? " The officer 's grip relaxed a little , and he stood looking down at her keenly . " He wrote my sister a letter from Richmond . " " Oh , you have brought him a message  --  from your sister ? " " Yes , sir . I come from Williamsburg. "  | " From  --  ! " The officer eyed her more closely . " How on earth did you get here ? " " I rode . " She gestured towards the ancient horse in the drive . " And what about the British ? Were n't you afraid of them ? " " No , sir . I came through the woods most of the way . " " Well , I 'm damned , " he said , not letting go her arm . " You come inside . " " Is Mr. Day here , sir ? " she persisted as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Do n't move . I 'll see about it . " He left her in the square white hall , its polished floor all scarred with spur-marks , its wide stair soaring upwards  --  and went to open a door on the right . " Captain Day ? " he called into the room , and a voice said , " He is inside , with the general . " The officer looked back over his shoulder at Tibby . " Wait there , " he said . " Do n't move . " The door closed behind him . Tibby waited , her heart pounding . The sentry paced up and down in the drive , where Crowsmeat stood drooping in the hot sun . The riflemen'svoices rose and fell and their laughter was free . There was a tramping on the stairs and three more officers in blue and buff came down with a clank of swords and spurs . They beheld a white-faced lad in their hall with surprise . " Hullo ! " said one of them genially . " Where did we get this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " By George , he has come to enlist ! " cried another , and made as though to clap the new recruit on the back . Tibby 's instinctive dodge seemed to him the wince of a child which anticipated a blow . " Here , here , did you think I was going to clout you , then ? " " Ducks like a nervous maid , " said the first man . " Who beats you at home , boy ? " The three of them stood over her in a grinning semi-circle , friendly but terrifying . Tibby swallowed her heart and took a step backward in spite of herself . " Cat 's got his tongue , " said the third man . " Who let you in here , son ? " " I 'm waiting for Captain Day . "  | " Day ? Good God , he belongs to Day ! " they exclaimed , and glanced at each other , and then looked with increased interest at her worn and dusty shoes and stockings , her skimpy sleeves , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested incredulously . " No , sir . N-no relation , sir . I have a message for him  --  from Williams-burg . " " From Williamsburg ! " Again they glanced at each other . " That is my horse out there , " said Tibby , seeking to distract attention even a little from herself . " He needs a drink pretty bad . " Through the open door they could see Crowsmeat , trailing his halter , the bundle on the ground beside his forefeet . " Where is Day ? " they asked each other , and their faces were grave and curious now . " He 's in there , I think . " Tibby pointed at the door on the right . " 1 am to wait here . " " I should damned well think you are ! " said one of them , and started towards the door just as it opened before Julian , who stood a moment sorting out the several figures in the hall . " Kit ! " he said then in astonishment , and came forward , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slanting green ribbon , and a sword at his side , but kind as ever , and  --  oh , thrice merciful God !  --  safe , with both his hands held out to her . Tibby caught at them blindly , feeling dizzy and near to tears now that she had done the impossibleand found him . " How did you get here ? " he was saying . " Did Tibby send you ? Is Tibby all right ? " It was upon her . She raised her face to him slowly , met his eyes , and told her lie with a steady voice . " Tibby is dead , " she said . His lips parted as if to echo the words , but he stood rigid and silents while the three officers melted tactfully out of the door . Watching him fearfully , she saw that he cared a great deal about Tibby . Exultation strangled her compunction . The news had hurt him  --  because he held Tibby dear . " Come up to my room  --  and tell me about it , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across her shoulders . " Crowsmeat is outside . He ought to be fed and watered . And may I please get my bundle ? "  | " Yes  --  get your bundle . " His arm released her . He followed her to the doorway and told the Negro groom to care for the horse . Tibby rejoined him , carrying her bundle , and preceded him silently up the broad staircase and along the upper passage as he guided her to a room at the back . It was just big enough for a narrow bed and a high chest of drawers , a table full of papers and pens , and couple of chairs . " Have you had anything to eat ? " he asked , and she shook her head . " I 'll send for something . " He went to the top of the back stairs , where she could hear him calling to a servant . She crossed the room and laid her bundle on the bed and took from it the doll Julia . Her palms were damp with nervousness but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which one of them she was . When Julian came in , closing the door behind him , she held out the doll to him , carefully clinching the lie . " Tibby sent you Julia , " she said . " To remember her by . " His face was a little frightening as he took the doll from her . For a moment she knew a wild impulse to tell him that he was not to grieve , that Tibby was not really dead , that Tibby was here , beside him  --  She clenched her teeth against it . If she told him that , he would only send her back to Williamsburg . If she told him that , she might never see him again , especially if there was a battle  --  Looking up at him as he stood silent , the doll in his hands , she knew that the one thing she could never do was to leave him , to be without him , ever again . " What happened ? " he asked at last , with an effort . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your mother too ? Oh , Kit , I 'm sorry , I  --  that must have been dreadfulfor you both . Was it the fever again ? " " We do n't know . Dr. Graves said her heart was tired . Tibby came home one day and  --  found her . It was along about the time your letter came from Richmond . We  --  Tibby wrote to you , and Mr. Sprague sent the letter . " " It never reached me . I did n't know . " Her eyes were brimming . He laid a hand on her shoulder  --  the hard , restrained gesture of man to boy , and she braced to meet it as Kitp263would have done , and wiped away tears with the back of her hand in his unfamiliar gesture . " Poor Tibby , " he said gently , and his eyes were on the doll . " She needed me then . When did she  --  how long after  --  ? " " Only a short time ago , sir . I was sick first and Tibby nursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever it was got worse and she died . " " Alone ? " " I was there . Father had left town on account of the British  --  and the Spragues went up river to Farthingale with the Greensleeves . Even Dr. Graves was gone . We took care of each other . We were used to that . " He turned away from her silently and sank into a chair at the table and put a hand to his head . She watched him a moment , her conscience writhing that she must distress him so , and then laid a hand on his sleeve . " You must n't feel so bad , " she said . " She did n't suffer . She just  --  did n't wake up . " " It seems impossible  --  it seems as though I would have known  --  I ca n't quite believe it yet  --  " His voice died away . Incredulously she recognized the same sort of thing she herself had said to St. John Sprague when Julian 's own death was in question . And now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him that neither of them could die and the other not feel it in the air they breathed . She had never dreamed that he could not be altogether deceivedabout Tibby so long as he felt her still in the same world with him . Self-preservation demanded another turn of the screw . " She said you would let me stay with you , sir  --  if she died . " " She told you to come to me ? " He turned to look at her from behind his shielding hand . " She did n't know how it is here , Kit , or she would n't have done that . You are too small for the army . You will have to go back home , I am afraid . " " I could be very useful to you , sir . She said I could look after your horse  --  and your boots  --  and she said perhaps I could help you with the letters , sir , because you taught us both to write a neat hand , you always say that yourself , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to set the doll Julia on top of the high chiffonier , where he left it with a long look . " St. John Sprague  --  you said he sent me a letter ? " " To tell you he had got back from Camden , sir . " " Thank God for that . I did n't know what had become of him . " " As soon as the wound healed he went to General Washington , up north . His aunt wanted to take us to Farthingale too , but I was sick then and Tibby had to stay with me . " " It 's a relief to know they are not in the town . I have been very worriedabout all of you since Cornwallis went in . " He seemed to pull himself together , to come into sharper focus . " Sit down , and tell me about Williamsburg . What is going on there ? Tell me all you saw  --  all you heard . " " I did n't see much , sir  --  with Tibby sick , and all . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course the town was full of soldiers drinking , and that . It is full of flies too  --  like the plague  --  I suppose because of all the horses that came with the British . They bite like anything , everybody is nearly crazy with them . The British have smallpox too . " " Yes , " said Julian attentively . " Go on . " " Cornwallis has his headquarters at the President 's house at the College , sir . They turned the Madisons right out , and wo n't even let them draw water from their own well . They have taken all the ammunition and stores down to Yorktown , and pretty well stripped the shops . There is a cannon down by our bridge , and a sentry . And outside the Raleigh  --  " " Captain Day ! " It was a bellow from the foot of the stairs , and Julian rose . " I have to go . Stay here . Do n't go out and get yourself lost , I wo n't be long . Here is some food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro boy arrived with a tray and set a plate with a hunk of bread and a chicken leg and a glass of milk on the table before Tibby . She ate hungrily , using her fingers . In a few minutes Julian was back , looking brisk and alert . " Come on , " he said . " You can finish that later . The general wants to see you . " " General Lafayette ? " Tibby stared , one cheek bulging.  | " Hurry up , Kit , do n't keep him waiting ! " Julian pulled her out of the chair , wiped her mouth with his own handkerchief , and then wiped her grimy , greasy paws , one after the other , efficiently . " He wants to hear about Williamsburg , we have had no word out of the city for twenty-four hours , and anything you know may be important . Do n't be nervous , now , just tell him anything you would have told me . " He whisked her down the stairs and through the white door in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to see them pass , and a second door closed behind them . General Lafayette sat at a large desk facing the door . He had brilliant searching eyes , and a captivating smile . His reddish hair , already thinning , was brushed straight back from his high forehead into a black queue ribbon , and there were traces of powder in it . His uniform was the smartest she had ever seen , not excepting St. John Sprague 's new ones after Brandywine . His epaulets were magnificent , his linen foamed with lace , his buttons and gold braid shone like jewels . He would be a difficult man to lie to . Tibby crossed the room with Julian 's reassuring hand on her shoulder . He fronted her up to the desk and then stood back , leaving her to face Lafayette alone . " This is the lad , sir , " he said . Tibby met the brilliant eyes bravely , wondering if she could hear the general speak above her own heart 's thumping . " What do you call yourself ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his long fingers . " Kit , sir . I mean Christopher . " " What is your age ? " " Fourteen , sir . " " You are rather small , are you not , for fourteen ? " " I am a twin , sir . We were both small . My sister died last month . " " Oh  --  you had a sister . " It was as though light broke over him . And the way he said it , with a long e for the short i and the syllables evenly spaced , made the word beautiful and somehow significant . " I see , " said Lafayette , and the words fell small and clear from his lips . His gaze rested thoughtfully on the place where the frantic pulse was beating in her thin throat , dropped with deliberation to where the wilted shirtrufflevibrated visibly to the pounding of her heart.  | Tibby stood helpless before him while the betraying blood flamed upward to her hair , and she thanked God as Lafayette 's eyes again met hers that her back was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than her own . How he had got the first inkling she could not guess . The fact remained that he knew . " I see , " he said again , stroking the quill , his eyes holding hers . " Alors , you joined the army , eh ? And you came through the British lines to do it . That is a thing my spies seem to find rather difficult . Well , now that you are here , what can you do to earn your keep if we let you stay ? " " I  --  write a fair hand , sir . I could help with the letters . " Lafayette dipped the quill in the ink-pot and held it out to her , flicked a sheet of paper towards her across the polished wood of the desk between them . " Write , " he said , with his French r . Tibby bent above the desk . Her fingers were cold and shaking . Sir , I beseech you  --  , she wrote unevenly , and stopped . He glanced at it cornerwise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Julian who stood composed , at ease six feet away . His skeptical French mind wrestled with this backwoods innocence and then accepted that . Captain Day was deceived . But how ? For how long ? On the face of it , the thing could not be done . It was , of course , none of his affair . " Well , Captain Day  --  his writing is at least as legible as my own  --  " The sheet on which Tibby had scratched her plea was crumpled casually in his long fingers and truly aimed at the already littered fireplace on his left . " Give him a pen and set him to work . But first  --  " " M-my lord  --  " Tibby stammered , her green eyes swimming . " Mon general  --  que le bon Dieu vous benisse ! " " French ? " exclaimed Lafayette , with a surprised glance at Julian . " A little , sir . His sister 's was as good as mine . " " Tant mieuxl " cried Lafayette , and his smile flashed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first  --  " He leaned towards her across the desk . " Tell me about Williamsburg . " " Oh , sir , you must please turn back , he said you had n't got a hope , sir ! " " Who said ? "  | " The Fusilier . He came to the cabin for a drink of water . He was very kind , sir , he said they did n't make war on children , and he gave me a penny to buy medicine for  --  for Tibby . " Small grimy fingers went to her mouth in an unconscious gesture . She had nearly let it out that time . She must be careful or this man would surprise the truth from her yet , before she knew it . " What else did he say ? " Lafayette inquired with interest . " He said there would be a battle on the Neck , sir  --  and that once they got started they would eat you alive  --  and they can , too , you never saw such an army , they  --  they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , child , we are a rough enough crew in the ranks , I promise you ! Have you seen my riflemen ? " " Yes , sir . But the British are all dressed alike , and their bayonets  --  there are so many of them , sir , and they are all such big men , and  --  oh , please , sir , it 's a terrible army ! " " J'en suis sar ! " agreed Lafayette cheerfully . " And how was your friend the Fusilier dressed , par exemple ? " " He was a redcoat , sir . " " His facings ? " Lafayette tapped the buff which turned back his own blue coat with silver buttons . " Light blue , sir . " " That would be the Twenty-third , sir , what 's left of ' em after Guilford , " said Julian . " Webster 's , eh ! " " Webster was killed , sir . " " Who was your Fusilier 's commanding officer  --  did he say that ? " Lafayette asked Tibby . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names of any officers ? " " There is a General O'Hara quartered at the Raleigh , sir . " " That means the Guards , sir , " said Julian . For another ten minutes Tibby underwent a stiff cross-examination as to the doings of the British  --  where she had seen big guns , where sentries were posted , what color facings she had seen in the town , and a great deal more to which she did not know the answers . She replied steadily , keeping her head , gaining composure during the ordeal . At last she was dismissed to Julian 's room to write down everything which occurred to her about the occupation , while Julian himself remained behind at a table near the General 's desk to finish a letter to General Greene . That evening Tibby sat eating her supper off the end of the kitchen table , while the maids washed up after the meal which had been served to the officers in the dining-room . The yard door stood open to the sunset . Suddenly a tall officer in the blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . For a second she thought it would be Julian . Then her heart stopped , and black Phoebe dropped the crock she held and curtsied above the pieces . Lafayette stood in the doorway , smiling at their astonishment . " Good evening , " he remarked gently to the buxom cook , who recoveredto place a wooden chair and wipe it off with her apron . " I wish to ask this lad some questions  --  privately . " Tibby had struggled to her feet and stood stricken beside the table . Lafayette waited against the light , while the cook gathered the two maids with a compelling glance and they all three retreated respectfully to the yard . Then he removed his three-cornered hat and approached the table easily , his handsome sword ajingle . " Please do n't have any fear , " he said , " I am no ogre to eat you . " Tibby stood mute , enduring his searching gaze . " It was Christopher who died , " he said . " Yes  --  m-my lord . " " And Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir . I brought him the doll he gave me  --  I said Tibby wanted him to have it as a keepsake . He never doubted . How did you  --  " The words died away before his small French shrug , his broadening smile . He tossed his hat to a chair and sat down on the edge of the table near her , swinging a booted leg . " Americans ! " he marvelled . " I will never learn . Always they amazep269me . You wonder what affair it is of mine , " he added , amused . " Captain Day is a member of my military family . A member in very good standing , I assure you . Therefore I have an interest . Believe me , a friendly interest . " She caught at the word . " You mean you wo n't give me away ? " " Is there no one else to do that ? " " No one in Williamsburg , sir . We were alone when Kit died . I did everything for him , and made the cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , polished boot . " It says Tabitha Mawes . " " Mon Dieu , but why should you do such a thing ? It is to me a horriblething to do ! " he cried with a little shudder , and waited . She was silent . " You have buried yourself alive . Why have you done this thing ? " he persisted . " It was the only way I could come to him . I had to see him . I just had to  --  see him , " she repeated helplessly . " Does he matter so much to you as that ? " " Nothing else matters to me , " said Tibby , unconscious of pathos . " Fourteen , " mused Lafayette , and there was doubt and query and amusement in the word . " I am sixteen , sir . " " Ah ! " " I took something off our age when you asked me , I was pretty sure he would n't remember how old we were , he never could . " " And is he then blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year since he has seen us . I look just the way Kit did then  --  he was always the smaller one  --  and Mr. Day never took much notice of how I looked anyway , you see , on account of Regina Greensleeves . " " Comment ? " queried Lafayette . " Regina Greensleeves . She is the most beautiful woman in Virginia . " It was stated as a fact . " Who says so ? " " You should see her , sir . Like the moon walking . " " The moon is cold , " he reminded her , his French heart enthralled by this tragi-comedy being played under his very nose in the middle of a war.  | " I do n't think  --  " she began , for she was vaguely aware that Regina , for all her lily-aloofness , was anything but cold . " Does she love him , then ? " Tibby frowned , searching for the right answer , unwilling to admit , lest it diminish the stature and prestige of Julian Day , that Regina Greensleeves was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many others in love with her , " she explained slowly . " Especially Mr. Day 's best friend . In the end perhaps she will see that no one else can hold a candle to him , but  --  it looks as though she would marry Mr. Sprague . " " Eh , bien , alors  --  ? " Lafayette spread his hands , but she shook her head . " Then it will be Miss Dorothea , " she said . " She is in love with him , I know , and she is very beautiful , and a lady . Kit and I  --  we just went to school to him . " " But , mon Dieu , this is of the theater ! " Lafayette rose from the tableedgeand strode about the room , his sword and spurs clanking . " This is not the sort of thing one anticipates to encounter in a wilderness ! This is  --  incroyable ! " He stood over her , and she wilted against the table , looking up at him , her small chin set . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face with his bright , knowing eyes . " What has this fellow Day done , to deserve such love ? " he demanded . " You m-must n't call it love , sir  --  " " What must I call it , then ? " Tibby stood with her chin imprisoned in his fingers while her green eyes filled . She tried to blink them clear again , and her tears dripped warm and wet on his hand . Pity and concern caught him up and he laid his other arm across her shoulders , and she wept convulsively against his coat-sleeve , undone by his sympathy . " Little one , " he soothed , patting her . " Little one , this can not go on . You can not stay here . " Instantly her sobbing ceased . " Oh , please do n't send me away , sir ! " " Not I , my dear . He will see for himself how impossible it is . " " Are you going to tell him ? " She jerked away from him , outraged and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he must be told . This is no life for you . "  | " I thought you were kind , " she said dully , without reproach , accepting betrayal , and her knees gave way so that she dropped back into her chair at the table . Lafayette looked heavenwards . " And I with Cornwallis on my hands as well ! " he cried . " I am trying to fight a war  --  and now this , in my own household ! Why do I concern myself ? Child , I am kind . Believe me , I do what is best for you  --  some day you will thank me that I see so clearly for you now , and you will say to me , Ah , yes , it was foolish , to think I could take the field like a soldier ! ' " She seemed not to hear , sitting motionless , her head against the back of the chair , her eyes closed . There were no tears now . Lafayette bent and took the small soiled hands in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence he had put upon her . She merely sat , without dramatics or design , looking helpless and half dead . Lafay  --  ette was wrung . " Petit ange , " he murmured above her . " Poor misfortunate infant , my little lost one  --  do not look like the end of the world ! Surely this life is too hard for you  --  surely you can not be content in these circumstances  --  whatis the good to you here , like this ? " " I can see him every day , " she answered literally , through white lips . " And where , if you will allow me , are you going to sleep ? " he inquiredwith Gallic simplicity . " He has given me a blanket in the store-room . No one goes there but the cook . She says I can eat in the kitchen if I wash up my own things . I think he gave her some money to arrange it . He said himself that the drummer boys would be too rough for me . That is natural , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And when we are on the march again ? We sha n't be here long , you know . How when we have no roof over our heads , and the rain comes down ? What then ? " " I could  --  lie near him , on the ground . " " Parfaitement , " he shrugged , and she would not meet his eyes . " Child , the man is not utterly an imbecile . " " It is different for you , sir , because you are not accustomed to see us together , Kit and me . Captain Day does not question which one of us I am , because dressed like this I look exactly like Kit . "  | " You are defending his stupidity , " he nodded . " But you do not convinceme . " " It does n't show on me ! " she pleaded . " No one else has seen , but you ! " " It shows in the way you lift your chin , " he said . " It shows in your wrists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His eyes rested briefly again on the frill of her shirt . " Most of all , it shows when you look at him . " " He will never see that . He is used to it , " she promised doggedly . " Some one else will see it , soon enough . Some rough soldier or sniggeringdrummer boy will discover it first , maybe , and then the word will run between the camp fires that Captain Day has got his doxy with him at headquarters , and how would you like that ? " To his admiring surprise , she laughed outright at a thing so far from the probabilities . " Do I look like a doxy , sir ? Or does he look like a man who wants one ? The worst they could think is that he is stupid  --  as you do . But they wo n't get the chance , I will keep out of their way . " " I can not allow you to remain , " he said firmly . " We shall get a battle , soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way then . I realize that Williamsburg is not fit for you at present , so I think I shall send you to Charlottesville with the next courier . Mr. Jefferson will have to look after you , he has nothing else to think about ! " He watched her face close in again , pale and set , with tight lips . She would never whimper . He went on one knee beside her chair  --  the French Marquis , Washington 's general , the magnificent Lafayette  --  on one knee , holding her cold paws in his long brown fingers . " Tell me again , what is that strange name of yours  --  the one on the cross above your brother . " " Tabitha . " " Tabitha  --  " ( That difficult short i . That all but impossible th ! ) " Tabitha , some day you will forgive me . " It was a plea . " May I see him once more before I go ? " she asked , motionless between his hands . With one of his broad , impulsive movements he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving in a stirring jingle of metal . " Am I Herod , commanding a slaughter of innocents ? " he queried of the rafters . " Am I a bowelless Hessian , a red-skinned scalper of babes ? " He whirled on her from the end of the table , stood contemplating thep273still triangle of her face with its closed eyes and rigid mouth . " En fin ! " he said quietly . " I know nothing . Are you listening , Tabitha ? I was not here tonight . It is none of my affair , I will henceforth concentrate on Cornwallis . Do as you please , in God 's name ! " " You mean  --  I can stay ? " He gave her his French shrug , his open hands , in a gesture of defeat . " And you wo n't tell him anything ? " she persisted . He came to her , cupped her chin in his big palm . " How can you so love a blockhead who must be told ? " he marvelled . She caught the warm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " And may I be there to see , " he added piously , " when our incredible Captain Day comes to his senses ! " His spurs were loud on the stone floor , his long shadow passed across the threshold , he was gone into the fading sunset light . Tibby rubbed grimy fingers across her eyes as though awakening from a nightmare . And then , because one gets very empty in the army , she returned philosophically to her cold , unappetizing supper . When she had cleaned her plate and cup , she went to report for secretarialduty in Julian 's room . Candles were burning on the table , a pile of newly opened despatches had just arrived from Lafayette 's own desk and awaited copying , sometimes in triplicate , sometimes in translation . Notations in Lafayette 's own hand were pinned to some of them . But Julian sat by the window where twilight still lingered , with the doll Julia in his hands , staring out into the trees  --  idle and sad . Tibby came towards him rather timidly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she suggested . " Miss her ? " His eyes went back to the doll . There was no life in them . His long body sagged , drained of its splendid vitality . " Well , yes , I suppose you could put it that I will  --  miss her . " " D-did you think so much of her , sir ? " " That is a silly question , Kit . You know I loved Tibby very dearly . " " But I thought it was Regina Greensleeves you loved ! " Julian rose with a sigh and set the doll Julia back on the chiffonier and arranged her skirts decorously . " That was a very different thing , " he said . " Tibby was  --  was a child . "  | " Well , but  --  she would have grown up some day . She would have been a woman . " " Will you for God 's sake not chatter about her ? " Julian requested sharply . " It will be bad enough to see your face every day ! " There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knuckles , between hysterical laughter and hysterical tears  --  she had had a long day , and a hard one . Then Julian moved heavily towards the table and sat down . " I 'm sorry , Kit . It is not your fault you look like her . Come and get to work . There is enough here to keep us at it all night . I will do General Greene 's first , and you may make a copy of Lafayette 's letter to General Washington . I ca n't offer you better than that , can I ! " Tibby received the closely written pages reverently , dipped her pen , bent above the blank paper , and ( remembering to imitate Kit 's y 's and capital I 's , almost the only difference between her script and his ) began to write : My dear General : By the utmost care to avoid infected grounds we have hitherto got clear of the smallpox . I wish the harvest time might be as easily got over . But there is no keeping the militia into the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is next to impossible to take them in their flight through the woods . On the other hand , the times of a great number are daily expiring and you might as well stop the flood tide as to stop militia whose times are out . Under these circumstances , it would perhaps be better to go and fight Lord Cornwallis , but exclusive of the diminution of force 1 have already experienced , I confidentially will tell you that I am terrified at the consequences of a general defeat . The ennemy have been " He has put two n 's in enemy , " she remarked into the silence . " Then you will do likewise , " said Julian , without looking up . " Yes , sir . "  --  The ennemy have been so kind as to retire before us . I thought at first Lord Cornwallis wanted to get me as low down as possible on the Neck and use his cavalry to advantage . But it appears he does not yet come out , and our position . . . . They sat together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Sometimes a paper changed hands , sometimes he spoke low-voiced directions , sometimes they paused to stretch cramped fingers . Tattoo was sounded , and gradually the camp sounds died away outside . The white curtains at the window moved in a hot breeze which brought the scentsp275of jessamine and roses . The candles dripped and guttered and were snuffed and finally had to be replaced with new ones . They toiled on , relaxed in the brooding intimacy of mutual fatigue , and complete absorbtionin a task . At last Julian looked up to find her slumped against the back of the chair fast asleep , the quill still drooping from her hand , which was none too clean . " Go to bed , Kit , " he said gently , and laid his hand on her arm to rouse her , and found the bones under his fingers pitifully small  --  as small as Tibby 's . " You must be worn out , with travelling . Go to bed , I 'll finish the job . " She rubbed swollen eyelids with a mumbled protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table to show her the way to the storeroom , where her blanket had been laid on a pile of clean straw in a corner beneath rafters hung with bacon sides and herbs and corn , in an atmosphere redolent of salt meat , spirits , and molasses . She pitched forward into blackness , drugged with exhaustion , and was asleep again before his footsteps had died away . Julian returned to his room and paused before the chiffonier where the doll Julia sat . His impulse was to shove it out of sight into the top drawer so that possibly he could forget its presence and work in peace . Instead , he stood a long time with his arms folded on top of the chiffonier and his face hidden against his sleeve . She saw very little of him , after all , in the middle of a war . But it made the deception easier , and at least she knew where he was , and could feel that she was of some use to him , when she spent long hours alone at his table copying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  pages usually drafted in his own fine hand . On the fourth of July , two days after her arrival in camp , Lafayette gave a dinner to his officers in celebration of Independence Day . She could hear the laughter and the toasts dimly from the kitchen
