Where Would the U.S. Be ? <P> <P> Sirs : <P> The people are awake , you say ? It is our Government which is responsible for our confusion ? Listen , the people are the Government , and if they are awake , then people do the damnedest things awake . They went into hysterics when Congressmen set up a pension plan for themselves . . . . The people started frothing at the mouth when Congressmen applied for X gasoline-ration cards . . . . <P> But when something really important comes up , do the people rise up in their wrath and demand action ? With prices flying higher , do the masses demand that the selfish blocs in Congress cease pressing their inflationary schemes , that Congress give us effective price and wage control ? . . . Are they retiring the Congressmen who were wrong , and putting in men who were right ? Are they doing these things ? Do n't make me laugh ! <P> So the people are awake , eh ? But Dr. Gallup says the people in F.D.R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the House of Representatives . . . . He finds them admitting that Fish was wrong before Pearl Harbor , " but so were a lot of us " ; so that makes it all right . . . . The people 's ad runs like this : " Wanted : as Congressmen , mediocrities . Successful applicants need no extra gasoline , should have no extra brains , will get no social security at all . Superior individuals need not apply . " . . . <P> Are the people awake ? No ! And they will probably get just what they deserve . <P> Sometimes , in a defeatist moment , I say to myself : " I still believe democracy is the highest , most practical political ideal , the only one under which intelligent , well-informed people can be happy . But , by God , I wonder if the U.S. is ready for it ? " <P> That , of course , is the wrong attitude . A better angle . . . is to consider that if the U.S. were not a democracy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fish , Taft , and B. C. Clark might have been able to seize power during the last five years . And if they had , where in hell would the country and the world be now ? <P> <P> A. W. HETHERINGTON Chicago , Ill . <P> <P> Calm , Cold Voice <P> Sirs : <P> When the Day of Judgment in American politics comes , I 'll look back over some of my issues of TIME ( Aug. 3 , in particular ) and then stand up and salute you , if I have legs and arms to do it . <P> In these days of sickening war slogans , catch phrases , gooey optimism , when people slosh about in the lowest ebb of journalism in history-yours is the only voice that has n't become hoarse and raucous , but remains calm and cold-furiously cold . . . . Maybe from this you can gather that paradoxically you 're reflecting the ideals of quite a number of people in this country . . . . <P> <P> LIEUT . Louis K. BASSETT Q.M.C. , U.S. Army Durham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to admit that a general sales tax is inequitable ( TIME , Aug. 3 ) . Yet you continue to report it favorably.
