Just before the British elections 100 American newspapers were offered an article by Clement Attlee outlining his socialist policies . Five papers-the New York Herald Tribune , the Philadelphia Bulletin , the Cleveland Plain Dealer the Toronto Star , and the Chicago Sun-bought and printed it ; the other 95 turned it down . Explanation by some who rejected the article : it was a little outside the main trend of events . <P> That surprised stocky , Hungarian-born Emery Reves , prewar agent for most of Europe 's writer-statesmen ( Churchill , Eden , Reynaud , Sforza , etc . ) . From long experience Agent Reves thought that he knew an important document when he saw one . The Attlee piece was his first postwar offering . Last week , when Labor won and Attlee became Prime Minister , some 35 of the previously disinterested papers changed their minds , sent him rush orders for the article .
