The big colleges , and the little colleges with big names , were getting the trade . <P> Last week , in most U.S. colleges , spring terms had just begun . Pitt was so crowded that classes had to be held on a day &; night shift . At Ohio State , wives of faculty members helped teach . Texas Christian University set up geology labs in a gymnasium . <P> Wisconsin quartered 1,866 veterans in a powder plant 35 miles from the campus , 1,660 more at an Army airfield . Columbia established a " trailer campus , " charging veterans for parking space but not for rent . At Rhode Island State , 28 Quonsets on Vet Row were jammed , eleven students to a hut . The president of Ohio 's Marietta College took in boarders . Some hardy students at U.C.L.A. slept in all-night movies and parked cars . <P> Everywhere student families played house in gyms , attics and cellars ( 40% of the ex-G.I.s were married ) . Princeton broke a 200-year-old tradition , let students ' wives live on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was besieged by 325 veterans a day . Illinois , Ohio State and Purdue turned down out-of-state applicants . Rutgers wrestled with a freshman class larger than the three upper classes combined . Enrollment at Michigan ( 13,714 ) was the biggest in its 109-year history . <P> Why Not Yale ? While the favored colleges grumbled over indigestion , lesser schools complained of malnutrition . The Association of American Colleges estimated that smaller colleges could absorb an extra 250,000 students . So far , 41% of all back-to-school G.I.s had packed into 38 schools , largely ignoring 712 other fully accredited colleges . In some cases the G.I. was only guilty of trying for the best-why go to Podunk College , when the Government will send you to Yale ? But others had a better reason : they wanted training in trades or professions which small liberal arts colleges were not equipped to teach . <P> Viewers-with-alarm talked of the overcrowding as " the veteran problem , " but it was more than that . Besides the normal influx from prep schools there were thousands of young war workers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made , and now wanted to catch up . So far , 300,000 ex-G.I.s were enrolled ; by fall , educators expected at least 750,000 . <P> Mostly they were a serious lot , impatient with spoon-fed schooling and such extracurricular attractions as hazing . Their grades averaged well above their fellow students . ( At the University of Minnesota , only three of 6,000 ex-G.I.s were in scholastic trouble . ) <P> The big problem was whether , with so many , they would get the schooling they were entitled to . Rochester University 's able President Alan Valentine warned that if enrollments continue to shoot up , " the quality of our education will be pulled down . " <P> Last week New York ( which has no state university ) decided to go into the business on a jerry-built , short-term basis . Governor Thomas E. Dewey summoned educators from the 85 New York universities and colleges . Said he : " Let 's get them in this year even though you will have to sacrifice some of your standards . " The educators agreed as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 12,000 ex-G.I.s at Sampson Naval Base near Geneva . Six upstate colleges will help supply about 1,000 faculty members ; the state will put up the cash ( $3-to-$5 million ) . Proposed name : Dewey College .
