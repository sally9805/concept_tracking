Army &; Navy service stores have been a money-saving blessing to righting men during wars . But they have often proved a money-losing headache for private businessmen in peacetime . After World War II ended , the post exchanges and ships ' service stores kept right on selling so many items at less than retail prices that private merchants complained loudly enough for Congress ' to hear them . Military stores , they said , were peddling luxury goods , like fur coats and watches , tax free ; groceries were being sold at wholesale prices in direct competition with local merchants , and large numbers of servicemen were buying goods for civilian friends . <P> Last week a House Armed Services subcommittee found the squawks justified . Though the armed services had shrunk about 85% since war 's end , the stores were still doing a whopping business . During 1948 the Army , Navy , Air Force and Marine Corps operated 589 stores in the continental U.S. , grossing $331 million at wholesale prices ( at the normal retail markup , plus excise taxes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Part of this volume , the committee found , had indeed come from luxury goods . Example : The Marine PX at Quantico , Va . had refrigerators , $250 cameras , television sets and outboard motors in stock . <P> The stores were also operating a big mail-order business in the form of " special orders . " Originally , special orders were designed to help servicemen buy furniture below retail prices , on the theory that they moved their household effects frequently and that " three moves equals one fire " in wear &; tear . Not much furniture was sold , but plenty of orders were filled , many for officers with a taste for diamond rings , fur coats ( tax free ) , sterling silver and automobiles . <P> The subcommittee found no reason why service stores should be exempt from excise taxes , ordered the stores to start collecting the tax . It also ordered the armed services to : 1 ) abolish all commissaries by Jan. 1 , wherever adequate civilian facilities are available ; 2 ) cut out all special orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The three services agreed to do so . Estimated loss to the military stores : 50% of their gross business .
