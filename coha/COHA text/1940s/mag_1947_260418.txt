Labor 's offensive against the Taft-Hartley Act hit Detroit . John L. Lewis had won one battle with a coal contract which had laid a few detours around the new law ( TIME , July 21 ) . Last week the C.I.O. 's lusty , restive United Automobile Workers opened up on the Ford Motor Co . U.A.W. made Ford a test case in a fight to get unions out from under any responsibility for wildcat strikes . U.A.W. wanted a clause in its contract specifically releasing the union from the law 's provisions that unions may be held financially responsible in court actions for failures to control the membership . <P> No Guinea Pig . Henry Ford II called the proposal " a disastrous precedent for scuttling . . . the law . " He would not become " a guinea pig . . . for all industry . " Ford 's negotiators would agree to setting up an impartial umpire who would determine whether the union had made " prompt and honest " efforts to prevent illegal walkouts ; Ford would not sue if the umpire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.A.W. to that . <P> Detroit was already feeling the pinch of another dispute over the issue of a " no penalty " contract . A two-week strike of 7,000 workers at Detroit 's Murray Corp. , which supplies body panels , frames and other parts , had already forced Ford to lay off 26,800 workers . The Murray strike had also forced Studebaker ( at South Bend , Ind. ) to lay off 10,000 ; the stoppage was backing up into other auto plants . <P> " No Penally . " The U.A.W. 's soft-voiced vice president , Richard T. Leonard , tried hard to soft-pedal the " no penalty " issue . The union 's negotiators were making a lot more noise about Ford 's shiny new model for a pension plan . Six weeks ago , when Leonard himself proudly announced the plan , almost everybody cheered . The plan was a first long step toward old-age security for thousands of auto factory workers ( TIME , July 7 ) . <P> Leonard and other U.A.W. leaders now charged that the company had " reneged , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not the same as the one promised ; parts had been added , parts left out . The union accused the company of downgrading its initial participation from an original $200,000,000 to about $180,000,000 ; of cutting an understood $15,000,000 in annual contributions to the fund about in half ; of refusing to give the union a voice in administering the fund . <P> No Matter . Lanky John S. Bugas , Ford 's industrial relations chief , hotly denied that the company was welching on the original " gentlemen 's agreement . " But , since the U.A.W. had brought the plan up as a strike issue , the company would also use it as a club ; it threatened to withdraw the whole scheme . The union set a strike deadline . A long strike would surely cost the workers the shiny pension model which Ford had offered them . This week the strike was postponed pending more negotiation . But the threat of a struggle neither side wanted remained .                  @ @ @
