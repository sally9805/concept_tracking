txt A startled senate today heard Chairman Tydings ( D. , Md. ) of the armed services committee say the United States must either support large European ground armies or raise its own land forces thru the draft . Frankly discussing the possibility of war against Russia , Tydings painted a stark picture of the sweeping obligations the United States assumed when it signed and ratified the North Atlantic treaty . He and Chairman Connally ( D. , Tex. ) of the foreign relations committee fired the opening administration guns in debate on the 1.7 billion dollar global arms bill . Even when available combat divisions in western Europe are properly trained and equipped they would still comprise only about half the forces needed to hold a Russian invasion , according to Tydings ' statements . French Poorly Equipped lie revealed that Gen. ' Omar Bradley , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , believes at least 35 to 50 well trained and well equipped divisions would be necessary to hold.RUSSian troops until additional help could arrive . Tydings said Britain , France , and Belgium could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , French particularly are poorly , equipped . An attack on any Atlantic pact signer would be the same as an attack against Chicago , and the United States would be obligated to step in , Tydings said . Sen .. George ( Ga. ) , ranking Democrat on the foreign relations committee , clashed sharply with Tydings over his interpretation of obligations assumed under the pact , and acceptance of military opinions . " No Reservation " " Is it the senator 's concept that the North Atlantic pact binds us to go to the defense of a country that does not defend itself ? " demanded George . " No reservation , 3f that kind was written into the pact , " retorted Tydings . " We adopted it hook , line , and sinker . If France were attacked tomorrow morning and unab ! . e to defend herself we 'd have to step in . " " Who 's going to attack France tomorrow morning ? " insisted George . " Russia perhaps , " replied Tydings . " You never know when anybody is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pearl Harbor . " George said France had 3 mil ' lion men under arms at the outbreak of World . War II and stood up for only 39 days despite alliances and assistance of the British and Belgians . " I did n't cast my vote for the . North Atlantic pact on the theory that we were obligated to go to the defense of any person who is unwilling to defend himself , " , George said forcefully . 100 Russ Divisions " We are bound to defend the Atlantic pact countries with the lives and resources of the United States , " Tydings in sisted . Tydings said Russia has about 5 million men under arms , or more than 100 divisions " equipped with the finest tacks . " Tydings quoted an anonymous military leader as saying 35 to 50 divisions , well equipped and in ' the right places , could " with- ? stand an attack for months and . , maybe turn the whole tide . " . George snapped that the senate is not to be bound by opinions of the military men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tydings said it was Bradley whose opinion he had sought . " But Gen. Omar Bradley is not a member of this body charged with the responsibility we have , " retorted George . Opposes Arms Cut Opposing George 's demand tor a cut in arms funds , Tydings : said unless funds are voted to train and equip European armies , the United States will have to spend vastly a:11rq and retain the draft to raise its own land forces . Such appropriations , he said , will make this bill " look like peanuts . " Tydings claimed the French ' have only nine divisions using outmoded and worn American equipment , the Belgians might raise four or five good divisions , I and the British have about sit divisions available , besides a good air force arid the remnants of a once powerful navy . " When these available divisions are properly trained and equipped we would still have only ahout 50 per cent of what we need ? " inquired Sen. Cain ( R. , Wash . ) . Tydings agreed . Internationalists such as Senators Connally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( R. , Mass. ) immediately stepped in , claiming there was no current commitment to support a , ny number of divisions such as mentioned by Tydings . Saltonstall sought assurances that the United States was not Preparing for war but merely seeking to prevent war . Tydings said : " Oh , this is to preserve the Peace by being so strong no nation will dare to attack . " However . he added : " We 're no longer responsible for Just our own terrain . Now we 're responsible for the terrain of others by a treaty . " No Limit In Sight Both TYclings and Connally. whose respective committees jointly considered the arms measure , fought against cuts in the program . George proposes to cut from 1 billion to 300 million the funds fur Atlantic pact countries this year . Connally admitted there is no predictable limit on the arms program . Connally said the Russian armies are " not organized to play Pole " but for aggressive and offensive action with full force when the time.is ripe . In addition to Atlantic pact nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek-Turkish aid , $21,19,000 for Iran , Korea , and the PhrIbpines , and $75,000 , - 000 optional assistance for China and the far east . The measure also reauthorizes 50 million previously voted for Greece and Turkey and would allow transfer of 450 million in surplus American arms .
