Eighteen indispensable men got ready last week for another winter 's work . They were the contrabassoonists of the eighteen big U.S. symphony orchestras . Without them , the U.S. symphonic season could not get off to a start . Though a contra-bassoonist without a symphony orchestra may be the lowest down of all musical phenomena , a symphony orchestra with out a contrabassoonist is not low enough . <P> Few concertgoers would know a contrabassoon if they saw one . But they might recognize a bassoon . Known in German as the Fagott , because of its resemblance to a slim bundle of sticks , the bassoon is the standard bass instrument of the " double reed " or oboe family . It has been known , in facetious circles , as an " ill woodwind that nobody blows good . " The contrabassoon is a giant bassoon built to sound an octave lower than the standard bassoon . <P> It is to the bassoon what a double bass ( bass viol ) is to the cello . In its long evolution since Handel wrote for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's coffin to a strong resemblance to an overcomplicated vacuum cleaner . Its 20-odd feet of wooden tubing are capable of emitting the lowest-sounds known to orchestral music-lower than any at the left end of a piano keyboard . To everybody but a contrabassoonist , its Stygian burps sound like abysmal Bronx cheers . <P> But symphonic composers , from Handel to Richard Strauss , have rated the contrabassoon highly , using it to fill in the substructures of massive harmonies . In compositions like Beethoven 's Ninth Symphony and Paul Dukas ' Sorcerer 's Apprentice , it is even given short , snorting solos . These passages are practiced by contrabassoonists with all the loving devotion that violinists give to the most exquisite concertos . <P> 25-Pounder . The outstanding contrabassoonist in the U.S. is a short , dignified Neapolitan named Roberto Sensale , of the New York Philharmonic-Symphony . Sensale first aspired to the cello . But when he applied for a scholarship at the Royal Conservatory of Naples , the only opening was a course in bassoon playing . In 1922 he joined the Philharmonic as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philharmonic 's veteran contrabassoonist , a stately Anglo-German named William Conrad , Sensale moved down an octave to take his place . <P> When Sensale is not playing the contrabassoon he spends much of his time whittling the cigaret-shaped reeds of his 25-lb. instrument . He is interested in few extra-contrabassoon matters . Says he : " I would like better to be a playing contrabassoonist than a retired bassoonist. "
