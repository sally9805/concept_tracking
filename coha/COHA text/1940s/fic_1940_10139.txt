Bloody Headcowboys gazed at her appraisingly , one or two raised their hats , and Odette came right to the point . " Boys , " she said , " I 'm simply perishing from hun- ger , no matter what my mother says . Will one of you gentlemen kindly give me a piece of beef , or will I have to take it ? " She looked very trim and statuesque in her long velvet gown and , five minutes later , she was sitting down beside Gram and eating a piece of meat . All the other girls followed suit , the sullen Ryan was all smiles , and in half an hour 's time the whole Haught family was breaking its long fast , although Elvina would not eat . Gram passed her up a piece , she went off by herself and from a broken-down wall she mounted her thoroughbred mare , sitting up in her saddle like an aristocrat . They saw at a glance then that these were quality- folks and rose in a body to offer help , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Musette followed , the whole Haught family mounted and , hooking up their skirts  --  which hung two feet from the ground  --  they felt that all danger was past . Not a cowboy had got fresh or offered any unwanted attentions in the brief time they had been gnawing at the meat , but Elvina was adamant in her disap- proval and led them off at a lope . Now that Red Ryan had mentioned it , there was no use drowning good cows . The thing to do was to turn them down the river and let them drink at the ford . She even let a couple of the boys cross " Drug ! " 41over and bring in the herd from the west . All was suddenly good will , as if nothing had happened , but the golden-bearded McCutcheon did not mount . There was a hereafter coming for this when the Haught men came riding back and saw who was squiring their dames . He sat down in the shade of the old adobe wall , and took out a little book . Then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mare Ona almost stepped on a rattlesnake . She jumped back and jumped again , tripped and fell and leapt up a second time , and Musette went over backwards . It was all due to the velvet skirt , hanging two feet below her feet , and Musette snatched for the horn , but missed . The mare started running , kicking back at the dragging woman , buckingwildly , then kicked again . Two men shook out their loops , made a throw and missed . It often happened in those days of long skirts and women 's saddles , not built for safety . The cowboys dashed after her , trying to build a new loop , but Musette was down and being " drug . " One chance was left and Beau McCutcheon took it . He shot the beautiful mare  --  twice . The first time he missed her , but the second time she dropped dead , with Musette 's foot still tangled in the stirrup . He rushed in and caught her up again , releasing the little boot , and carried her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms he laid her down and began to manipulate her ankle  --  and then a fury struck him . " Get away from her , " cried Elvina , jerking down42 Bloody Headthe mass of skirts . " What do you mean by such impertinence ? I 'll give you to understand , sir , that my daughter is a lady . You 've killed her horse . That 's enough . " Beau McCutcheon stepped back , dazed , but he waited until he saw Musette stir . Then he mounted and rode away . CHAPTER VTHE HIGHTOWER HORSEHERDONE after the other the cowboys dashed after their leader as he took the trail up the river , but he was riding like the wind . " Damn a woman , " he muttered . " The old heifer struck me when I was trying to help her girl . I would n't hurt Musette for anything in the world . She was such a sweet little thing . " " Never mind , boy , " said Montague Payne , catchingup with him . " The old lady was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mare she would have drug Musette to death . But seems like we get in wrong everywhere . " Payne was a wanderer , another college boy gone wrong , and he spurred close up beside McCutcheon . " The boys looked a little rough , " he commented . " But they did n't mean any harm . She was a beautifullittle girl  --  and they all tried to ketch the mare  --  but if you had n't shot it , she 'd be dead . " " Sure as hell , " nodded Beau . " I tried to crease the mare the first time . But she was crazy  --  I had to kill her . And then Musette 's mother gave me a slap in the face and told me to get away . " 4344 Bloody Head " The whole bunch was kind of nuts , " laughed Red Ryan , riding up . " Do you know what she did when Odette raised her veil ? Reached over and pulled it down ! " " But Musette is just a child , " complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when I tried to help her  --  " " The old lady hit you , " ended Red Ryan . " She was that way from the start . But when I looked up at her and said : Any fool ought to know that , ' she knowed that I meant her . " Why do n't your girls come over and eat ? ' I asked , intending to get acquainted . " Because they 're not hungry , ' she said . And then that Odette girl walked right down past her and asked for something to eat . ' I 'm simply perishingfrom hunger , ' she said . Will one of you gentlemenplease give me a piece of beef , or have I got to steal it ? ' How 's that for nerve ? And I handed over a chunk of meat , stick and all . You ought to see the smile she gave me . " " Well , we 're all dished now , " answered Beau McCutcheonbitterly , " with that old hen running the roost . Right away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help , she decided we were stealing her cattle , and if the Texas Rangers should show up she 'd send them on our trail , damned quick . " " She 'd tell ' em right where to find us , " laughed Red Ryan . " In the first saloon , getting drunk . " " Say , there 's a big bunch of cattle up ahead ofThe Hightower Horseherd 45us , " said McCutcheon . " The tracks were made today , and , following along behind them , are some barefooted pony tracks  --  bunch of Comanches , out to steal their horses , I reckon . Sure as hell , when they pass the point of Guadelupe Mountain , they 'll jump em . " I can see the cattle 's dust , " exclaimed Red Ryan , " and it 's coming on to storm . Maybe this is that Captain Hightower that Odette was telling about ; and sa-ay , boys , was she a pretty girl ! " " Never mind the girl , " interrupted Beau . " What did she say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his outfit , along about eating time . " " You said it , " responded Ryan , jumping his horse into a lope . " I used to know Captain Hightower , when he was a Ranger . He 's bringing two thousand head of cattle across the desert to deliver them at Fort Sumner . If we can get in with him we might begin to eat regular again . That would be a good job for all of us , and he 's got a swell nigger cook . " Right up ahead there , " went on Ryan , " is where New Mexico begins . You might be interested , Mr. McCutcheon , in case the Texas Rangers show up . Because the man that owns that horse you 're riding is going to be coming after him . " " Sure is , " agreed Beau . " But I did n't steal this bay  --  just took the wrong horse by mistake . Feeling around in the nighttime  --  " 46 Bloody Head " Yes , " laughed Bobbie Skeets . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the corral . " " Well , I did , " protested McCutcheon . " Best horse I ever rode , though , and sure as hell somebody will come after him . I 'm going to keep a-going until I get to California , and then I 'll be looking back-wards . " " You 've been looking over your shoulder , " jested Ryan , " ever since we rode out of Fort Davis . But the line is right ahead here , if you can see the monument , and when we get across , we 're safe . I came down through this country two years ago  --  " " It 's raining , " announced Skeets , as a rattle of big drops hit in on them ; and then he began to sing . " Out with the herd and coming on to rainAnd my damned old slicker is back in the wagon . " The black clouds piled up as they had been doing for several days , dragging long trailers across the sky , flooding one place and missing all the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north and they went up the trail at a lope . A big storm swept down upon them , obscuring the view , and they knew that Hightower was not far away . In the distance they could hear the bellowing of cattle , and then suddenly a wild stampede . When Indians were near , although keeping out of sight , the steers would dash away from them , repelledby the rank odor of smoke . Now , from the banks of the Pecos , where they had been hiding inThe Hightower Horseherd 47some wash , a party of Comanches , glamorous in warbonnetsand buffalo heads , rode in recklessly , followingafter the rush . Then , shying away from the cowboys , they turned and swung back on the horseherd . That was what they had come for  --  the horses  --  and while the Texans were riding after the cattle they rushed them past the wagon and headed down the trail . Along the river , every man waving a blanket or brandishing his lance in the air , they bore down like a whirlwind on the astonished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beau McCutcheonand his men had been raised on the Border since they were boys , and they knew it was Hightower'shorseherd . The Comanches were heading for Pope 's Crossing  --  where the banks of the river were low  --  but all eight cowboys drew their pistols and charged . Regardlessof numbers , every man for himself , these sons of old Texas lived up to their traditions and whirled in on them from the rear . The horseherd was crossing the river , and that slowed the Indians down . Then suddenly the Comanches turned back on them . But when the pistols began to pop and naked Indians to go down they halted and put up a fight . There were fifty or sixty Indians , armed with lances and shields and some with old-fashioned pistols , but the Texans rode right into them , shooting their Navy six-shooters with both hands , but keeping48 Bloody Headright on . That was the only way they knew , and on his black-maned bay Beau McCutcheon took the lead . A Comanche warrior rode out at him , horse and man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lances , the Indians closed in on him . A chief seized his war club , swung it by the horse-tail at the end and hurled it into the crowd . Something hit Beau on the head as he was fighting in the melee and he tumbled off under his horse 's feet . The next thing he knew there were Texans all around him and a bearded man was examining his head . " He 'll live , " he said , whipping out a white rag and wrapping it around the cowboy 's bloody locks . " You ca n't hurt a cowboy in the haid . Bring those horses back , men , before someone else jumps us . You did well , boy  --  charged right into them . I saw you from behind . " CHAPTER VIWARRIORS " Is THIS your horse ? " inquired Hightower , coming back with Beau 's bay , " A good animal , boy . Bay , with a black mane and tail . A true mustang , the strongest breed there is . Seems to me I 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , " admitted McCutcheon , sitting up and feeling of his head . " He belongs to a Texas Ranger named Rye Miles . " " From Fort Davis ? He belonged to my com-pany . " " Best horse I ever had , " said Beau . " Well-reined  --  never gets tired  --  with a walking trot that 's hard to beat . But I expect Mr. Miles to be coming after him . Although I left a good roan in his place . " " Oh  --  oh ! " grunted Hightower . " Traded horses , eh  --  by mistake ? " He straightened up and shouted orders to take the horseherd back , but McCutcheon did not let the matter drop . " Yes , " he said . " We left there in the nighttime and took the first animals we could find . It was what you might call a forced play , with the Rangers and deputy sheriffs both after us . But we 're across the495o Bloody Headline in New Mexico now , so I reckon old Hot Foot is Illine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed Hightower . " I happen to know this man Miles and he thinks a lot of his horse . However , Mr.  --  er  --  " " McCutcheon , " put in Beau promptly . " BeauregardMcCutcheon , from Waxahatchie , Texas . " " Well , Mr. McCutcheon , " went on Hightower , " I 'm glad to make your acquaintance . Especially under the circumstances  --  turning my horseherd back for me and all that . Mighty clever of you boys to go to so much trouble to help an absolute stranger , and if I can speak a good word for you do n't hesitate to mention it . About those Rangers , you know . The finest remedy for that head of yours is a poultice of prickly pears , and if you can ride your horse until we get into camp I 'll guarantee to fix it up . None of your friends got hurt , I 'm glad to say , but if you come from Waxahatchie you must be related to an old friend of mine , Joe McCutcheon . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " " He was my uncle , " explained Beau . " My father was killed two years ago . " " Oh ! Too bad . And what was his name ? " " Beauregard Ismay McCutcheon . " " Yes , yes . An honorable name , but I do n't happen to recognize it . Was he in the Rangers , too ? " " Yes , sir . With Captain Jack Cureton . " " Well , well ! " exclaimed Hightower , helping himWarriors 51up on his horse . " I was a scout for old Jack , myself , Ottce . But we 'd better keep up with the horseherd Or the Indians might jump us again . They hang around the point of Guadelupe Mountain and we can always count on their attacking us somewhere. ut since we 've got these Navy pistols they 're get-g kind of shy . I 've fought quite a number ofdians in my day and there 's one thing I 've foundt . There are very few of them that will stand upgunpowder , and your boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comanches always carry offeir wounded , but you winged quite a few of them , 1 reckon . " " I knocked down two , " said Beau , " but something hit me on the back of the head and  --  " " That was a war club , " grinned Captain Jack . " ' l'lic Comanches tie a cow-tail on the end of the handle and throw it like a sling . I happened to shoot that hombre right after he hit you , but you 've certainly got a sore head . You 'll have to be my guest while I poultice you up and give you a few squareGals . I 've got the finest cook in the country  --  his : name is Isham Dart . He 's always got beans and beefnd coffee , and what more does a man want ? I 'm taking two thousand head of steers to Fort Sumner , but we 'll stop at Deep Lake first . And by the way , you tell your friends to stop at my wagon and Isham will feed them good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ; but we killed a beef down at Horsehead Crossing and  --  " 52 Bloody Head " A beef ! " yapped Hightower . " Did you happen to find a stray ? " " No , there 's about ten thousand head more down there and  --  " " Who do they belong to ? " cursed the Captain . " Why , we just left the Crossing yesterday , and all I saw was ten thousand rattlesnakes . " " The cattle had crowded in until they dammed the whole stream . Belonged to a man named Haught . " " Hell 's bells , is he there already ? He 's rushing in to spoil my market ! Excuse me , Mr. McCutcheon , but this is very important . I knew these settlers would follow after me . " He spurred off , grumbling into his beard , and when Beau caught up he was waving his hat and urging the point men on . " Was that Henry Haught ? " he asked , coming back . " Henry or Hank or call him what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were about forty women and not a single man . They were all up at a salt lake , where their cows were dying by the hundred , and when I crossed the ford the women took us for cattle-thieves , and ordered us on our way . So we turned the cows loose and swam across to the other side and Red Ryan killed a yearling withouthardly asking permission and we all began to eat . " The old lady , who was doing most of the talking , herded the other women into the stage-stand , but aWarriors 53fine-looking girl caught her horse and came down and they all began to eat broiled meat . That was the end of it , as far as I was concerned . I lay down in the shade , but while I was reading a book one of their horses stepped on a rattlesnake and pretty near killed a girl , running away . " Well , I shot her horse when it passed , and the next thing I knew a woman slapped me over , giving me hell and telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the trail when we ran into those Comanches , and all the time we never saw a Haught . But that old lady was sure on the warpath  --  " " She sent us away like she owned the country , " complained Red Ryan ; and Jack Hightower grunted scornfully . " How the hell they crossed that desert , " he said , " is more than I can understand . But one thing is certain  --  they 're going to spoil our market unless we push this herd right through . " He held up his sombrero and waved it at those in front , and came back talking to himself . " Mr. McCutcheon , " he began , " and all you gentlemenwho so kindly turned back our horseherd , we thank you from the bottom of our hearts and I want you to eat at the wagon . My pardner , Martin Hockaday , has got a ranch up above here , and I wo n't rest , clay or night , until we make this delivery . You look like good cowmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isham , give these men some grub . " " Yes , suh , and thank you , suh , " answered a voice54 Bloody Headfrom the chuck-wagon . " Jest ride up close , gentlemen , and I 'll pass out the best I 've got . " A small , black colored man , driving a team of four mules , looked up at them with a beaming smile and , while they drank their coffee and ate some corn bread and beans , he kept on along the road . " The Captain , suh , " he explained to Beau , " is mighty proud of this mess-wagon of his , the first of its kind in the world . Done invented it hisself , without any assistance . Now all the other outfits is makingsome . Whenever I stop I build a little fire with some buffalo chips I carry along under the wagon in a big piece of tarp I 've got . I prepare my dinner while the men are eating breakfast , and I always keep my coffee hot . Yes , suh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you welcome . Heah 's some pine pitch that will be good for that wounded head of yours . Yes , suh , if all the boys would fight Injuns the way you do there would n't be a Comanche on the trail . But when they doubled back and stole our horses I shuah expected to be scalped . " Isham laughed as he handed them out some light bread and molasses , but all through the night Hightower'slonghorns went tramping on , for Haught had given him a scare . If a party of women and children , with ten thousand head of mixed cattle , could come across the desert like that , it would not be long before others would follow . Every cowman would hit the trail . They crossed the Pecos at daylight on to a broadWarriors 55and level plain , with here and there a small bunch of cattle , but they were mostly cows with calves , not half of which bore brands . It was a virgin cowcountry , with salt-grass and grama , and a few cottonwoodsalong the stream . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stole the cattle and traded them to the Mexicans . It was horse-meat they were after , preferring it to beef , and Hockaday had let them steal . That was easier than keeping up a constant warfare , and Martin was always shorthanded . He was a tall , lanky man , mounted on an old potbelliedmare , with a rope hackamore and a boy 's kak saddle  --  not the kind of man you would expect to find as king of all that country . But , over all those wide plains , as far as a man could see , he ruled by the force of his powerful personality and the magnetismof his smile . He lived at Deep Lake in the middle of the valley , where the herds all stopped for water , and as Hightower 's men crossed the river he rode down the trail to meet them . " What 's this I hear ? " he asked as he shook hands with Captain Hightower , " about ten thousand head of cattle , coming clear across the desert , with a mixed herd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Haught , from the Brazos , " answered Hightower . " And if I do n't deliver these steers right away I 'll lose a right smart of money . It rained when he was halfway across the desert or he 'd have lost every cow he had . " 56 Bloody ( lead " Sho , sho , Jack , " commented Hockaday . " It just shows the age of miracles ai n't past . My two nephews , John and Lester , are over on the Brazos now , picking up two more herds . " " I tell you , Martin , " yelled Hightower , " people do n't know how bad these Indians are . I happened to get by the first time , because I 'd followed the buffaloes south , but they 're coming north a million strong , with all the Comanches in the country behind them . Are those the cattle you contracted to give me for a dollar a head , over the market ? Then I warn you , right now , send some men out to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got . " " Do n't think so , " laughed Hockaday . " The Comanches are too busy roasting buffalo humps and cutting out the tongues . These cows will be all right to sell to the Government to feed to the ReservationNavajos , but the Mescaleros would n't touch ' em . Too tough . They 'd rather have horse-meat . " " Yes , there you are again , " retorted Captain Jack . " What 's to keep ' em from running off your horseherd ? Only yesterday they jumped ours , right in the middle of a big stampede , and if these boys had n't happened to be following along behind me and put up a hell of a good battle , I believe I 'd be following them yet . You see this man here , with his head wrapped up in a rag ? He got that from a blow with a war club that mighty nigh cracked his skull open . " " Well , well , " commented Hockaday , looking closer . " So he put up quite a battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to guard my lower range . Those twenty-three cowboys that I 've been feeding all winter , doing nothing but running up bar-bills , pulled out on me last week , taking half their horses with them , and went up the trail to Denver . " " Well , in that case , " said Hightower , " I 've got just what you 're looking for , Martin . Eight of the fightingest warriors that ever came up the trail . Shake hands with Mr. McCutcheon , of Waxahatchie , Texas . Just come up from Fort Davis . They might take on with you for a while . " " Well , Jack , " chuckled Hockaday , " this is sure providential , like that rainstorm that saved Henry Haught . I need a few good , nervy men , to cut these herds when they come through . Forty dollars a month , no work to do , and all the whisky you can drink . " " Sure ! " agreed Bobbie Sheets , laughing . " Going to cut Henry Haught 's herd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on your book right now . His wife called us cow-thieves the minute she seen us , and I do n't like the old heifer , nohow . " " Hired ! " nodded Hockaday . " How about you , young man ? " He turned to Beau McCutcheon , who shook his sore head and laughed . " Nope , " he said . " Little out of my line , cutting trail-herds . I 'm just going through on my way to California , but I thank you , just the same . " " Well , stay around a while , " invited Hockaday , 58 Bloody deadhospitably , " and let your head heal up . Jest the sight of that white rag is all you really need , if you got it fighting the Comanches . " " He did that ! " spoke up Hightower . " I was there and saw him do it . He got that head in a battle with the chief ; and , young man , let me tell you something . Next time you go after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear this Leopard Coat . They 'll call you Bloody Head or something like that , and look up to you , like a warrior . " " All right , call me Bloody Head , " answered Beau . " But I 'm on my way to California . These boys can stay if they want to  --  " " Yes , " observed Red Ryan , grinning . " The fact is , Mr. Hockaday , Beau done stole a Ranger 's horse and he wants to get away with it . " " Oh , that 's all right , " laughed Martin . " I do n't care who owns a horse , as long as I get to ride it . And I do n't care who owns a cow as long as I brand the calf . My hands have quit so often that half my cattle are mavericks  --  " " I did n't steal that horse , " denied Beau hotly . " I just traded for him in the dark , leaving a damned good roan in his place . But my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cow and I have n't got over it , yet . " " That 's right , son , " nodded Hightower , approvingly . " I swear half the cows on the Brazos are wearing some other man 's brand . I paid the top price , had ' em give me a bill of sale and even then IWarriors 59nearly had a cut . This same Henry Haught that 's coming over to ruin my market rode out and tried to stop me . But that 's something I 've never submittedto yet ; and I warn you , Martin Hockaday , I want a good bill-of-sale for every cow those nephews of yours bring in . " " Aw , sho , sho , Jack , " laughed Hockaday . " Did I ever sell you a cow that did n't have a straight brand ? But I ca n't hire cowboys to brand up my mavericks , so I wait until I make a sale and slap on the roadbrand , right then ! " " All right , if that 's the way you work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first man that fetched shestuffinto the country and it stands to reason the mavericks are yours . But over on the Brazos there 's men who make a business of branding up orehannos . " " Have n't hardly been worth stealing , " shrugged Hockaday . " And I just cai n't keep these warriors . I hired a bunch of Mexicans to do the work and they would n't get mounted till noon . Horses like I 've got , it takes a man to handle ' em . " " We 'll ride ' em , " promised Red Ryan ; and Hockadayhired them all . Except one . CHAPTER VIISOUND PRINCIPLES " So YOU 'RE going to cut the Haught herd , " observed Ryan with a shrug . " Well , that 's where I shine  --  cutting trail-herds . " " Coming in and going out , at the other edge of my range , " sighed Hockaday . " Got to do it or they 'll run off all my cattle . Cut ' em down to the trailbrand , ' that 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Fair enough , " agreed Red , " and we 'll start in on Henry Haught . His wife as much as told us we were a bunch of common cow-thieves , and I do n't like the old heifer , nohow . But she 's got a daughter I 'd sure like to put my iron on . That girl , Odette . Eh , Jim ? " " Prettiest girl I ever saw , " nodded Harry , as they rode along beside the wagon . " Jest as slim and straight , and with all that blonde hair . But hard to put your hand on , I reckon . " " That 's where I shine , again , " boasted Ryan . " Making up to these pretty girls . But the old lady has got us down in her black books , on account of Beau shooting that mare. " 6oSound Principles 6i " I had to do it , " defended McCutcheon , " or she 'd have been drug to death , right there . And I 'll thankyou boys not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to do  --  let her get killed ? " " No ! " spoke up Jim Brady , " you did just right , Beau . Our reatas were so stiff from getting rained on that we could n't rope a short-horn . But you were out ahead , you saw us both miss and you killed the mare , like that ! " He snapped his fingers , but Beau turned away and for a long time he rode in silence . Then he fetched a book out of his war bag and read it as he passed along . It was a copy of Romeo and Juliet  --  the boys called him Shakespeare George  --  but that was just the name for another man they had known before they were locked up in jail . It had been a forced play , with the Rangers fighting against the sheriff and a big gang of outlaws horning in ; but , with Jeff Davis County bankrupt and the judges afraid to officiate , Beau McCutcheon had broken out of jail . They had all broken out together , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could find ; and , even across the line , Beau McCutcheon still glanced backward and muttered to himself . Where the sheriff had n't been paid and caravan robbers ran the country , six months was long enough for any man to wait trial , in a court that never convened . The Rangers had arrested them , following a fight in a saloon , but there had been no one to turn them62 Bloody Headloose again . All the judges had resigned , being afraid to pronounce judgment against the bandits and , as the summer came on , the snake-hole had begun to get hot . It was a pitch-black hole , blasted out of the solid rock and covered with enormous timbers , but Beau McCutcheon had put his back against one and let every prisoner out . They had recovered their saddles , their guns and their rigging  --  and all that would have been forgiven them  --  but when they rode off on the first horses they could find they had committed the unpardonablesin . For those horses belonged to the Texas Rangers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before them , a circle of blue water on the prairie , where cattle continually came and went , and cottonwoods grew along the ravine . It welled up from the plain , a huge artesian spring , ten acres across , flowing away towards the river in a wooded ravine , from which the water had been diverted to Martin 's ditch . It was the boast of Hockaday that he could sit on his back porch and catch fish from the rushing stream . The old fort was a bunk-house where any man could sleep , and he welcomed them all to his table . " Make yourselves at home , boys , " he said to the grinning cowboys . " The barroom is right over there , and for these men I 've just hired I 've got somethingspecial  --  a brand-new bullpen , just finished and fully furnished . Want to see it ? Well , come on in , then . " Sound Principles 63He led the way to a square adobe structure , and bowed to them as he opened the door . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in each corner there stood a full bottle of whisky , with another one in the middle for luck . This was their introduction to the Long Rail brand , where for several years he had hired all who came , without ever having enough men . His last aggregation , a gang of thirty men , had left him in a body , hiring out for double his wages and leaving their bar-bills unpaid . The new men took a drink all around , to celebrate finding such a kind master ; but Beau McCutcheon camped under a tree , for the wound on his head was bad . There was no prickly-pear cactus on those barren plains from which a poultice could be made , and Isham Dart 's pine pitch did not seem to be very efficacious . So he lay down in the shade and let the world go by , for Hightower had to hurry on . Yet before Hightower left  --  to deliver his longhornedsteers before Colonel Haught rode in on him  --  Captain Jack found time to make him a visit . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't for you I 'd be chasing Comanches , this minute , and maybe losing my horseherd . Now I want you to look my horses over as they pass by and pick out the best animal you can find . " " Many thanks , " answered Beau , rousing up . " And if you 've got another mustang half as good as the horse I stole I 'll try to send old Hot Foot back. 64 Bloody HeadBest horse I ever rode , but he really belongs to Rye Miles . " " Yes , he does , " agreed Hightower , " and I 'll tell you , Mr. McCutcheon , I do n't think you 'll ever regret this . Because Rye Miles is a fighting fool when it comes to losing his mount . So I 'll pick out another bay with a black mane and tail and you 'll never know the difference . And the first man I can trust that is going down that way I 'll send back old Hot Foot , personally . Your father was right when he brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another man 's cattle . I never hire a man like that myself , and Martin Hockaday may live to regret it . " Now I 've got to be pushing on , to deliver these longhorn cattle , but I 'm going to remember you as a man of sound principles . Do n't fail to look me up if you happen to be passing my way . I can use a man like you . " CHAPTER VIIIROMEO AND JULIETIT WAS five days later , Hightower had delivered his long-horned steers and was heading back to Texas for more , when the first herd of Henry Haught 's cattle appeared on the lower range . They traveled as always in straggling bunches , each man with his brand separate from the rest , the covered wagons following behind . They had lost over two thousand head , out on the desert and from drinking poisonous water , but they came on in a body , the steers in the lead , the cows and calves strung out behind . Martin Hockaday loped down to meet them , expecting to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herds had been stampeded he gave way to a fit of cursing . It had been Lester 's fault , for he had let his cows get strung out and the Indians had rushed in upon them . Eleven hundred head of cattle had gone like the wind and then the Comanches had come back for the horses . Not satisfied with the buffaloes which were still moving north , they had charged in and run off the horseherd , and when Hockaday heard the news he wheeled his old mare and galloped bask to Deep Lake. 6566 Bloody Head " Mr. McCutcheon , " he complained , " I 've got two of the orneryist nephews that the good Lord ever let live . They 're my sister 's sons and I try to put up with them , but neither one has got a lick of sense . Here Jack Hightower has crossed that desert twice without ever losing a cow , and these boys have let their whole herd be stampeded ; and lost all their horses , to boot . And here this Haught outfit , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed cattle , come through without losing a cow . That is , until they reached the river and drank that pisen water at the lakes . I hear they lost two thousand head . " He went off talking to himself while the Haught herd moved slowly on , and when Lester and John came in to report he sent them back for more . " Go back and get those cattle , " he stormed . " Grab the first eleven hundred you can ketch and put them on the trail . Your uncle is under contract to deliver them to Jack Hightower and he wo n't take no for an answer . Look at these Haughts , bringing in that many cattle and fixing to bust our market . Herding their cows with women on horseback , riding around with long-tailed skirts . I 'll hold ' em while you gather your cowboys  --  then I want you to go back . Under-stand ? " The first of the Haught herds moved in slowly , spreading out around the lake as they watered , then drifting out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back for their wagons and haulingRomeo and Juliet 67them down to the Pecos ; and in the midst of their watering a caravan of Gospel Healers came toiling in from the north . But Hockaday made them welcome . In all that land , for two hundred miles , his was the only spring of water free from alkali and , while eight thousand head was a pretty large order , he had his reasons for inviting the Haughts to stay . " Why , yes , " he said as he met the Haught womenfolks  --  whohad taken him for the hired man . " There 's plenty of room for all . That 's what I need , is good neighbors . Just turn your cattle loose and it wo n't cost you a cent to gather them . My boys will bring them in on the regular roundup . Glad to do it , to have someone to dance with . " He laughed so wholeheartedly that Mrs. Haught insisted upon making camp ; but Henry Haught had had trouble with his neighbors before this and he ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliffs of the Staked Plains to the high mountainson the west ; and from Fort Sumner , where the I udians were kept , to the Texas line , it was nearly two hundred miles more . But the Haughts were glad to stop where the grass was so rank and high , and the Indians were kept away . " Injuns ? " repeated Martin Hockaday . " With those soldiers right up here , not forty miles away ? I 've had my horses stolen more times than you can c ount , but a few neighbors will fix all that . The Government feeds the rascals and pays us for the beef , so we 're glad to have ' em stay . There 's ten thousand68 Bloody HeadNavvies and fifteen hundred Apaches . The sutler comes down here and buys our cattle for eight cents a pound on the hoof . Have you got a few fat steers you 'd like to sell ? Or some that are not so fat ? You 'll have to look out , though , or the Comanches will steal your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you like . " It seemed to Henry Haught almost too good to be true , after some experiences he had had , and he put double guards over his horseherd . But that very night someone stampeded half his cattle and he drove his horses into the corral . Then , right in the middle of this good fortune , Haught met a man he knew : Captain Jack Hightower , with twentyfivegood men , returning to the Brazos for more beef . " Mr. Hightower , " he said , riding out to meet him . " I understand you 're buying beef . " " I am , " returned Captain Jack , " but only from my friends , and I do n't include you in that class . You tried to cut my herd when I was over on the Brazos , and that 's something I never forget . " He spurred his horse ahead , his cowboys scowling back at the Haughts , and the naught boys knew they were ditched . In fact , they were beginning to have a hunch that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung by the neck with horsehobbles  --  andthe Hightower cowboys looked death . Even the seven men who rode the range for Hockadayhad suddenly changed their ways . Down atRomeo and Juliet 69Horsehead Crossing they had been more than gallant  --  after the ladies had accepted their broiled beef  --  but when Mrs. Haught had ordered them away they had taken great offense . And now , over the line in New Mexico , the jail-breakers from Fort Davis , who had been fleeing from the Texas Rangers , were discovered in a position of authority . They were Martin Hockaday 's " warriors , " hired to fight for his rights , and even the beauteous Odette was disregarded . Instead of getting up a dance , where they could continue their harmless flirtations , the cowboys still referred to Mrs. Haught as an old heifer and kept away from her entirely . Red Ryan had called her a fool to her face and H aught had intended to rebuke him , but Red was so obviously on the prod that he wisely refrained from antagonizing him . Beau McCutcheon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader of their band and in his absence the women could learn nothing , except from the Mexicans who worked about the place . He was ill , they learned that  --  struck down by a war club in the hands of a Comanche warrior , who had been killed the next minute by Hightower . But when Mrs. Haught had ordered Beau away  --  after he had saved her daughter from certain death  --  she had alienated the good will of every warrior on the rancho . Even the Mexican rancheros agreed that Don Beau was muy hombre , one man in a hundred when it came to fighting Indians . But he had been injured  --  they would say no more. 70 Bloody HeadThe Haught clan had camped not far from the ditch which drained off the waters from the lake . A long ditch , full of running water and shaded by rank-growing cottonwoods , under one of which McCutcheonhad taken refuge . While Red Ryan and the rest had moved into the new bullpen and celebratedby a general carouse , Beau had camped outsideunder a brush ramada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haughts up the ditch , or even passing down it , he did not want to see them , but the mystery of his hiding-place was finally solved by old Gram , who gave a Mexican two-bits . Beau was lying face-down on a pile of prairie grass when a skinny hand reached over and touched him , but when he looked up and saw who it was he did not even smile . Gram was all right and the head of the clan but he had formed a low opinion of the Haughts . They were like any other Texas clan , composed of all kinds , good and bad ; and if the men were like the women he did not want to have anything to do with them . But Gram stepped over the plank which had been laid across the ditch and placed a hot cookie in his hand . " That was sent to you , " she said , " by one who wishes you well and would like very much to see you . She herself has been sick , having been drug by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " Oh ! " exclaimed McCutcheon , and smiled . Then he ate the hot cookie which had been baked for him and turned his face away . Romeo and Juliet 71 " And will you come with her ? " he asked . " Just as you please . She is my dearest granddaughterand I would not wish any harm to come to her . At the same time she is so sweet  --  " " Then come with her , " he said , and shut his eyes . At last she had found him , this Musette that he had dreamed about but had never expected to see again . He had watched for her through the stakes that served for a barricade and kept people from looking in as they passed ; but he was glad that at last she had found him , although his head was still bad . It ached and throbbed in a most disconcerting way and the cowboys all suggested new remedies . But here was one who could cure him , merely by her presence . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on a dish-faced little Indian pony and , when she did not get off he knew that she had been hurt . Badly hurt , though she still wore her long velvet riding-habit , hanging two feet from the ground . " Let me lift you off , " he cried , leaping up , and Gram held her horse 's head . Then he reached up reverently and took her from the saddle that had so nearly caused her death . She was lighter than he had thought for , and her face was pale , but when he put her down she lifted up her lips and kissed him . " I had to thank you , " she said , " for all you have done . There is a revivalist in town and Mother does not know . She is down there singing glory hallelujah . " 72 Bloody HeadShe smiled , with a trace of bitterness , and Gram sat down outside , holding their two horses , saying nothing . " I do not agree with her about everything , " Musettewent on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandma has told me it will be all right to see you , as long as she is along . " " Or even if she was n't , " answered Beau , moving over beside her . " I have wanted to see you , to find out how badly you are hurt , and to speak to you about that skirt . It is a very pretty skirt but dangerousfor you to wear . I hated to kill your horse but I had to do it . The Indian women do n't wear long skirts . " " I know it , " she replied , blushing a rosy red and brushing the hair out of her eyes . " But  --  oh , Mr. McCutcheon , if you knew how I hate them ! I want to ride free , like men ! " " Then do it , " he advised . " Get one of these buckskinsuits , such as the Indian women always wear . They come halfway below the knees and  --  " " But Mother will never let me do it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the second time I 've been drug from the saddle and it came near being my last . " " It did that , " he agreed . " I was shooting at two hundred feet and your mare was pitching and running . But of course , if your mother objects  --  " " I do n't ! " spoke up the harsh voice of Gram , " I 've been thrown a hundred times , and every time I beRomeoand Juliet 73lieved it was my last . Why women wear such skirts is more than I can imagine , but some French queen was born deformed and she had to wear one , and all the others had to follow suit . It was anything to be in the style . Are you a book-reader , Mr. McCutcheon ? What is that book you have there ? " " Oh , it 's Romeo and Juliet , by Shakespeare  --  you 've heard of it , I 'm sure . " " Yes , I 've heard of it , " admitted the old lady . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Girls ' Seminary which I attended back in Louisville , it was n't considered very nice . " " Perhaps not , " responded Beau , tucking it under his coat . " But while I 've been lying here with no one to talk to  --  " " Let me read it , " begged Musette , reaching out . " Your mother might think it would ruin your morals , " he said . " They spoke a different language in those days , and called a spade a spade . " " Oh , let me have it , " she exclaimed impatiently . " I Iave I got to live to the end of my days without reading anything , and wearing skirts two feet too long ! I hate them ! " " Yes , and so do I , " agreed Gram . " But , dearest , we must be getting back . All the men-folks have gone up to Fort Sumner to try and sell their cattle , and the women are down in that tent , singing . This opportunity may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. McCutcheon ? " 74 Bloody Ilead " Never mind , " he said . " Away from here  --  I 'll never see you again . But where arc you going ? To California ? " " Nobody knows . It may be to Arizona or we may settle down in this lovely place . But conditions became so desperate back on the Brazos that we just got up and moved . But I want to know you  --  sometime , " quavered Musette . " My father and mother do n't approve of my ways and very soon I shall be a woman . Then they will compel me to marry some man ; but , Beau , I want to know you . I know you broke jail at Fort Davis ; Mother says you consort with bad men . But I know you are good and , when the time comes I 'd rather marry you . That is , if you still want me . " " I do , " he said , glancing across at Gram as he gave her a friendly kiss . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting and I 'm sorry your mother does n't like me  --  " " And all I think of is you , " declared Musette . " I do n't care what she says . But I could n't rest or sleep , for fear you would go away and I 'd never get to say what I think . But ever since you saved me I feel that I belong to you . Only , of course  --  " " We 'll have to wait , " he nodded . " But I had been reading one of the greatest love stories ever written , and Juliet was only fourteen . " " Oh , was she ? " she laughed back triumphantly . " I 'm going on fifteen , myself . But Gram has always been my friend . She told me it would be all rightRomeo and Juliet 75if I came over to see you , although my mother is very strict . And Ash , he always watches me  --  " She fell silent , for the meeting had broken up and Gram had risen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without her ever seeing you , " the old lady explained . " And  --  well , Mr. McCutcheon , good-by . " She climbed nimbly on her horse and Beau saw the reason why . Elvina Haught had looked across and seen them and was coming on the run . But Musette was looking up at him with tears in her eyes , and she did not shrink away . " Are n't you going to help me  --  up on my horse ? " she asked , and McCutcheon leaned down to lift her . " Of course I am , " he said and kissed her again , before he swung her up . " Here ! What are you doing ? " demanded Mrs. Haught , shrilly . " I declare , if it is n't that Beau ! Now you leave that child alone , Mr. McCutcheon , " she stormed , " or I wo n't be accountable for what I do ! " " You never are , " he answered back , defiantly , " and I might as well tell you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've talked it all over and  --  " " Oh , here 's your book , " he ended , passing Musetteher Romeo and Juliet as her mother snatched her away . And Musette held it close . CHAPTER IXPROTRACTED MEETINGSTHAT there was no love lost between McCutcheon and Elvina Haught anyone could see at a glance . He stood right up to her when she started to scold him , and she took it out on the girl . " You Musette , " she began , " what are you doing over here in the camp of this strange man ? You ought to be in the wagon , recovering from your accident , and here you are , with him ! " " She could n't sleep or rest , " answered Gram , " until she thanked him for saving her life . So I took her over , while you were going to the meeting  --  and Mr. McCutcheon is a perfect gentleman . He got his head hurt in a battle with the Indians , and he 's been here ever since . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and  --  " " Did n't he break out of jail ? Did n't he steal that Ranger 's horse ? Well , Gram , I 'm surprised at you , and I 'm going to forbid you to have anything more to do with my children  --  " " You cai n't forbid me , " came back Gram . " Henry Haught is my son  --  as good a man as ever lived  --  and if he saw how you are running around with that preacher  --  " ' 76Protracted Meetings 77 " Now you shut up ! " challenged Elvina , and Gram winked at Beau as she laughed . " You take care of your morals and I 'll take care of mine , " she advised . " There 's very few , if any , of us that have n't made a few mistakes , but Musette is my favorite grandchild and I wo n't stand to see her abused . " She put her arm around Musette , rode back to the wagons and Beau turned back and lay down . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and equally disgusted with the evangelist . Just that afternoon he had driven in down the north trail , which was taking so many people to California , and hardly had his strikers put up the wellworntent when the whole Haught family swarmed into it . The preacher was a man of experience , having seen women like her before , and after telling five stories about hunting coons in Arkansaw he knelt down and began to pray . Then he sang  --  good old songs about love and salvation  --  and when he got around to his exhortation , half the crowd was at the mourners ' bench . It might be religion , but Beau did not like it , and they were going to continue that night . For three days and nights the band of Haught women had been suffering for some emotional outlet , and this old preacher with his broad shoulders and bearded jowls offered just the relief they wanted . Nor were the women the only ones to get his message . Martin Hockaday had gone down before the first tent was78 Bloody Headup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haught outfit returned from Fort Sumner they found Hockaday and half his cowboys singing and patting their hands . Red Ryan sat beside the fair Odette , who was inquiringabout his soul 's salvation , and Red had a series of confessions to recite that drove Gram out of the tent . She had a hunch that Ryan was possessed of some ulterior motive not associated with religion and the Haught men were very glum . After a long ride to the Fort they had found the contracts all let and it would be necessary to go clear to Santa Fe to make a bid on the next one . Moreover , a man named Adams had so underbid the rest as to give credence to the report that he was venal  --  that he had no intention of meeting his contracts , but was merely trying to break the market . And the rumor was afloat that all Texans would be barred for allegeddisloyalty to the Government . This was a last blow to their hopes for a ready sale and they were talking about going on ; but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and brought them into the tent . It was a general rule of this Cattle King , who ruled the Pecos for two hundred miles , that no trail herd could enter or leave his domain without being cut  --  twice . Once when they entered Deep Lake , after picking up the mavericks on his range ; and once more when they left his range , with more or less strays in their possession . And yet , when Hockaday 's warriors cutProtracted Meetings 79them down to their trail brand , almost all the Texans objected . Some objected violently , and that was what the warriors were for . Martin Hockaday had a hundred and fifty powers of attorney , authorizing him to seize Texas cattle found in New Mexico but not in the present owner 's brands , and sell them for one half the profits . Most of these cattle had been stolen by the Comanches and sold to the Mexican ranchers . Others had been picked up from the open range in Western Texas when the trail-masters were going through . It was the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stray cattle into the main herd , and no questions were asked . But Martin Hockaday , though he made everybodywelcome and had never charged for a meal in his life , had to strip the passing herds clean or he would n't have a beef steer left . The Texans had been very careless  --  they admitted it themselves  --  but at the same time they objected to the cut . And , until his two nephews got in with their herd , Hockadaywas sitting tight . So , if he could keep the I ! aught family contented , with good water , free grass and free meals , it would be better , all around . After ( ; aptain Jack had accepted the herd which John and I , ester had gone to get  --  the market would probably case off a little , although other herds were moving north . In an era of big movements , of trouble and of strife , Martin was always for peace . He never car-8o Bloody Headried a pistol  --  except on the few occasions when it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he stole he lost ten to the rustlers who had gathered on the edge of his range . He was honest , as cowmen go , but at times he had to be firm . And Hightower would soon be back . His was the one herd that was never questioned or cut . He bought nothing but longhorn steers , from the bottomlands of the Brazos . He branded every one of them in the chutes before he started out and , out of courtesy , he cut his whole herd again before he left Deep Lake . That was why he never forgave Henry Haught for daring to question his count . And when he heard about the eighteen neighbors found hung by the neck with horse-hobbles , he and his men were ready to fight . But Captain Jack had something to do besides mix in on a family feud , and he had always found Hockaday honest . They had ridden the trail together until Martin had settled down , brought in she-stuff and begun to build up a herd . Now Hightowerwas paying him a dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up as he passed . There was a tremendous rush of cattle into Colorado , where the mines were opening up ; and with a quiet bunch of men , well-versed in the trailing business , he was making money hand over fist . When the other drovers from Texas underbid him on his Indian contracts he pushed right on into Denver , making a new trail as he went . Some called him The Trail-maker ; but he was a law-maker , too . AndProtracted Meetings 81the stealing was getting very bad . There were men on the Brazos who made a business of branding mavericks , but they never sold to him . The last time he passed Deep Lake he had not even stopped to eat . Henry Haught , who had insultedhim , had dared to offer to sell him more cattle  --  after demanding a cut on his herd . But with the casygoing Hockaday it was different  --  and Martin was strong for religion . He loved to sing and pray , at his hands and confess his sins ; and with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go by . Ile loved the sound of women 's voices , the deep emotion of their appeals , the sight of their fair faces , covered with tears ; and if his warriors quit work to join in on the protracted meeting , it was all the same to him . Only  --  when the Haughts left  --  it was their duty to cut the herds , now reduced to eight thousandhead . I le put off the evil day when he had to inform t hem that a quarter of their cows must be left . The l.iw applied equally to Mexicans and Texans , to men under arms and Indians with war-bonnets . He Ih.uI , wrapped up in a section of zinc pipe , powers of attorney to claim half the brands in western Texas , tltctttgh he never felt it necessary to show them . And i f , after cutting out the strays , he never felt called upon to sell them and give the distant owners half the profits , the rustlers in the mountains to the west were doing the same with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream , full82 Bloody Headof hope and the sweet expectation of winning salvationand love ; and then , when his nephews brought in their second herd , he realized that something was wrong . The brands were not right and , although they had whipped off the bloodthirsty Comanches , he knew that Jack Hightower would never accept these steers . The boys had stolen the first cattle they had come upon , just as their uncle had ordered them , and now it was too late to change . But one thing he could do  --  he could cut every maverick out of Henry Haught 's herd and give them all a hair brand . It was quick , it was sure , and he had time to do it ; but the Haught women would never smile on him again . CHAPTER X THE LAST NIGHTTHE Haught men-folks had been clamoring for days to hit the trail and go , but Elvina had been fascinated by the songs and sermons of the preacher , his stories about hunting coons in the swamps while he was " water-bound in Arkansaw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next morning they decided to start . After all , it was Henry Haught that did their thinking for them ; and , right or wrong , they did what he said . Their cattle had been held , loose-herded , ever since they had stopped at Deep Lake , but when they drove them down for a last drink of sweet water , Martin Hockaday and his warriors rode out . Everybodyknew that he always cut the cattle , and yet they could hardly believe it . He had always been so friendly , so hospitable and kind , and he had only seven warriors . " Going out ? " he inquired ; and when Haught nodded , Martin turned and spoke to his men . " Cut ' em down to their trail-brand , " he directed ; and that meant a thousand head. 8384 Bloody Head " By what authority ? " demanded Henry Haught ; and Hockaday opened up his powers of attorney , the first time he had ever shown them . He had collectedthem in western Texas when the cows had no value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State of Texas , " he answered . " These owners have authorized me to seize every cow-brute that I find in New Mexico and sell it for half the profits . Sorry to see you go , but that 's my ironclad contract . " " It may be all that , " retorted Haught , " and yet not work in this case . I have kept my cattle looseherdedevery minute , there is n't a maverick in the bunch ; and I 'm here to inform you , Mr. Hockaday , that you ca n't cut a single cow . " " These are my warriors , " said Hockaday , waving his hand towards Red Ryan and his men , " and their orders are to cut your herd . Are you going to do it , boys ? Eh , Red ? " " Sure as hell , " returned Ryan . " You do n't look bad to me , Mr. Haught . Never did and never will . Any time you 're ready you can just start shooting , and I 'll bet I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little nearer to the front and Henry Haught beckoned up his men . " Well , boys , " he said . " What are you going to do about it ? Look those papers over first , " he suggested to his brother Si . " And one thing I 'll say right now . If we ca n't go north we can keep on going west until we end up in Arizona . " The Last Night 85 " The papers are all right , " reported Haught at last . " How about it , Mr. Hockaday ? Suppose we stay right here . What then ? " " Stay as long as you want to , " answered Hockaday politely . " But you do n't go any further north until we cut your herd . " " We 'll stay , then , " decided Henry Haught promptly . " I was looking for something like this , Mr. Hockaday . You 've been too good to be true . But as long as there 's a road to the west we 'll just keep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chorused his cowboys and turned their cattle out on the plain . It extended forty miles east and west , and two hundred miles , north and south , watered all the way by the Pecos River , with grass a foot deep everywhere . Not even in Texas was there a range so magnificent , and yet it was held by one man . A little , insignificant man who hardly ever wore a sixshooter . The Apaches could have killed him long ago , but they decided to let him live , for , with him gone , who else was there to bring in so many horses and cattle ? The Haughts could have killed him , too , if they had had the nerve , but they decided to let him live . It was open range in every direction , he had said that he needed neighbors ; and , with all the women folks to entertain him and listen to his experiences , they were safe for one more night . Their protracted meetings had reached a height of glory where they86 Bloody Headwanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen , Haught posted a double guard . Then , after dark , he called out every man , for they had had two or three stampedes . Let the women get the glory if they wanted to . Henry Haught had been bred on the Texas frontier , where anything was likely to happen . They might have a big stampede , with all their cattle scattered and mixed up with Hockaday 's cows . Then they would have a cut  --  maybe started by the Indians , maybe started by somebody else . It was two days after the full moon , when the Comanches made their raids , and Haught did n't put it past this psalmsingingCattle King to start the stampede himself . Personally , Henry Haught distrusted all preachers , especially since Elvina had got religion at a camp meeting and had been on the edge ever since . He hated evangelists on general principles , but he let her attend the meetings . It would keep Martin Hockaday out of mischief  --  and all seven of his warriorswere there . A little rough , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then , the whole country was rough . These particular warriors had broken jail at Fort Davis and every one of them was on the dodge . Beau McCutcheon , their former leader , was hiding out from the Rangers and keepingcarefully out of sight . Not since little Musette had ridden over with her grandmother and pledged him her heart and hand , had McCutcheon seen his loved one , yet he stillThe Last Night 87watched the wagons where her folks were camped , and still hoped that his dreams were true . He had hoped she still would come  --  before they went away  --  and give him another kiss . Thank him again for saving her life and pledge it all to him . He was young  --  he had nothing and was on the dodge  --  but youth must have its dreams . She came , just after sundown , when the singing began and the kerosene torches flared up in the tent , where all the people had gone in . She was dressed in her best  --  the same velvet riding-habit she had worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked  --  with two feet of trailing skirt  --  she caught it up with a silver chatelaine . Her face was concealed beneath a heavy veil , the russet gown looked black in the dark . She stood up , straight and slender , though a little small . But then , she was only fourteen . With a little girl like her he did not feel bashful ; and when she appeared in the twilight , he hurried out to meet her . " I just came out to see you , " she said . " Even Gram does n't know I 'm gone . But  --  I had to returnyour book . " She thrust it into his hand and started to go , and Beau did not call her back . But the voice of her mother , singing psalms in the tent , encouraged her to stop and hurry back . " You do n't know , " she said , " how many times I 've read it , while I was lying there in the wagon. 88 Bloody IleadDid it really happen ? Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that ? " " I like to think so , " he answered , giving it back to her . " And I want you to keep it  --  always . Yes , there was a Juliet , of the house of Capulet , and she loved Romeo until she died . " " And did men fight like that  --  for nothing , almost ? Why , Beau , it was almost like now ! All the Haughts are like that  --  they 're trying to make me marry and I 'm only fourteen . Like her . And that scene in the garden , when he climbed up to her window and spoke such beautiful words ! Oh , tell me , could that be true ? I wanted to see you and find out about it before we all went away . But Gram would n't let me  --  until tonight . Then she dressed me up in my elegant new riding suit and told me I might go . Are you ever going to see me again , " she said , " or is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sight . " She drew him into the shadow of a cottonwood  --  and as she walked he noticed that she limped  --  but when she sat down on the bank above the ditch , she reached over and touched his head . " Are you getting well ? " she asked . " Does that wound still bother you ? Oh , you seem like a knight , fighting battles , but my mother says you 're an outlaw . She says you 're hiding out for fear the Rangers will catch you . She says you stole a horse . " " Yes , I did , " admitted Beau . " And the horse was a good one , too . But Captain Hightower gave meThe Last Night 89another one , for whipping off these Comanches , and he 's going to give the first one back to the Ranger . It 's a man he knows  --  Rye Miles  --  " " And are n't you hiding out , " she cried , " at all ? Oh , Beau ! " And she kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ca n't we ? " " Well , that 's what I hoped , " he said . " Does your grandmother think I 'm all right ? " " She just loves you ! She thinks you 're wonderful ! But she says we 're both too young . " " We are ! We are ! " he answered . " But do n't let them marry you off . And when you grow up I 'll have a ranch and everything . Captain Hightower is going to give me a job . When he found I would n't work for Hockaday because he wanted me to cut the herds he said I was just the man he was looking for . An honest man , ' he said . An honest man . ' He says he 's got a job that calls for a little nerve , but he saw me when I fought off those Comanches ; and if it had n't been for me and the rest of the boys they 'd have stolen every horse he had . " " But this Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He 's making love to Odette , but Gram says he is crooked . He 's a bad one ! He 's on the dodge ! " " So am I , " he laughed . " But Captain Hightower will square me . He knows this Rye Miles and when he sent the horse back he told him I was a very good man . A man of principle . One he could trust . " " I 'm going right back and tell that to Grandma , " declared Musette , jumping up . But she tripped in90 Bloody Headher long skirt and sat down  --  hard ; and Beau had to pick her up again . " You 're gaining weight , " he said , moving closer beside her . " It wo n't be long until you 're big enough to marry me . But when can I see you again ? " " I do n't know , " she sighed . " My mother does n't like you and  --  Oh , the meeting is breaking up ! Or is it just somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurrying up the path , and gasped as she moved away from Beau . It was Odette , tall and handsome ; and beside her , holding her hand , ran Ryan . They went by without seeing them , but near the house she stopped short . " Where are you taking me to , Red Ryan ? " she asked ; and he tried to steal a kiss . " You know ! " he laughed and she slapped him over backwards . " I hate you , " she cried , running away ; and when she passed them she was sobbing . " I think I 'd better go , " said Musette in a still , small voice ; and McCutcheon let her pass . It was so unusual , so unexpected , Odette slipping off this way with Red ; the quarrel and her coming back . Not the usual lovers ' quarrel . It had a sinisternote . For Ryan came rushing down the pathway , spitting out vulgar oaths as he passed . But Musette returned and stood close to Beau and he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not like that , are you , Beau ? " she asked ; and stood a long time , listening . " As soon as the meeting breaks up , " she began . Then a form in the distance moved towards them . It was Ash , tall and menacing , a pistol on his hip , and without a word he hit Beau on the jaw . " Go on back to your mother , " he commandedMusette , and turned back to strike Beau again . " So this is what you 're up to , " he cursed , " youand that so-arid-so , Red . " " What ? " cried McCutcheon , striking out at him ; and Ash Haught went down like a log . He was a big man and a violent one , taking advantage of his weight ; but when he scrambled up Beau knocked him down again . Then he snatched him up , still raging , and smashed him over the head with his pistol barrel . They were still fighting away , half groggy from their beating but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to tremble beneath their feet . There was a roar like distant thunder , the pounding of thousands of feet , and in an instant the herd was off . " God ! " cried Ash . " A stampede ! " He flung down his opponent and was gone . CHAPTER XI THE STAMPEDENOBODY knew what had started the cattle . One moment they were lying down , close-guarded by armed men ; the next instant they were off with a savage clacking of hoofs , the clashing of thousands of horns . As their heads struck together there was a flash like sheet lightning , the horses ran like the wind and the great stampede was on . Men rode on the left side , turning the herd to the right , trying to mill them and tie them up in a knot ; but something had stampeded every cow in the herd , they sensed some invisible presence and were gone . They outran the fleetest horses across the open plains and at daylight they were miles away . Then , wearily , they turned back , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only now they were mixed in the wildest confusion . And there would have to be a cut . Greater than the terror of a lightning blast , strikingin the middle of the herd , was this panic which nobody could understand but which left every cowbrutewild . They came back in scattered bunches , cows separated from their calves , steers still running as they remembered their fright , and no one could92The Stampede 93accuse the warriors of Martin Hockaday , because every man had been at the meeting . Hockaday had been there , and Ash Haught had been fighting Beau McCutcheon . At the moment they had been locked in a blind , senseless combat , which neither of them tried to explain . At a word , a mere implication , they had closed in sudden battle . Ash 's head was bloody , Beau 's head was bruised and red ; and as long as they lived they would burn with unreasoning hate . And before they could cut every maverick in the herd  --  every Lightning Rod , every Long Rail , every Jinglebob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were mad enough to fight . Red Ryan was up in front with his pistol in his hand , and he trimmed them down to their trail-brand . At a mere word from Ash Haught he had struck him off his horse . His gun was gory with hair and blood , and he invited the whole clan to draw and shoot . Then , at the end , he called Odette a name which no gentleman would use . And yet Ash was afraid to take him up on it , for Ryan was just waiting to shoot . The preacher moved his tent without waiting to pull up the stakes and Hockaday did not ask him to stay . There was blood on the moon when Jack Hightower rode in and asked for his thousand head of cows . He had signed a contractwith the sutler at Fort Sumner to deliver that many cattle . Not that Jack wanted them , or would make any profit  --  for Andy Adams had knocked the94 Bloody ( leadprice to almost nothing  --  but he had given his word to deliver this mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There 's some mistake here , " he said to his oldtimepartner . " Every one of these cows has been hair-branded . Where 's your bills of sale ? " " I have n't got any , " replied Martin humbly . " These boys lost their first herd to the Comanche Indians and I told them to go back and get more . Grab the first thousand cows they could ketch on the open range and get them here on time . So here they are . The Indians wo n't know the difference and  --  " " Do you expect me to accept these cattle ? " demandedHightower , " when you know every cow has been stolen ? Well , things have gone to hell in the Pecos River country when Martin Hockaday turns crook , and I 'll have to put my foot down . I 'll have to take a loss under my contract , but I refuse to accept these cows . " " Then here 's my own herd , " protested Hockaday . " I 'll take the loss myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've just cut from Haught 's herd . You can take your pick from that . " " I 'll never accept a cow that Henry Haught ever owned , " answered Captain Hightower , angrily . " He done doubted my word by demanding that cut and both of you can go to hell . What this country needs is a little plain honesty . And by the way , where 's Beau McCutcheon ? " " He 's around here somewhere , " answered HockaTheStampede 95day sullenly . " And Mr. Haught , you can move your cattle . Move ' em north or move ' em west , it 's no difference to me now ; but git ' em off my range . " " Yes , you old tarrapin , " cursed back Haught . " You 've got your cut , so I can go , eh ? I 'd jest like to know what caused that stompede and mixed our herds all up . I would so . " " Well , so would I , " yelled back Hockaday . " But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my men . Every one of us was here , attending divine service , so take your cattle , and go . " " Turn ' em west , boys , " shouted Haught , waving his hat as a signal . " And , Mr. Hockaday , we 'll meet again . " " Any time , sir . Any time ! " answered Martin , as his enemy rode off ; and Captain Hightower regardedhim reprovingly . " I wish I had ten Texas Rangers here , " he said , " and I 'd make you both hunt your holes . But go your way , Martin Hockaday , and I 'll go mine . I 'll never buy from you again . " He rode off , still rumbling , and when he saw Beau McCutcheon , lying under his tree , he threw up his hands in despair . " Fighting , eh ? " he grunted . " Head all beat up again . Well , I sent that horse back to Rye Miles at Fort Davis and I have n't heard a word out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Beau . " I 'm going west , anyway , and it really does n't make any difference . " 96 Bloody Head " It makes this difference , " came back Hightower . " You 've returned a horse you stole and , as far as I know , your conscience is clear . You can ride the trail now without looking over your shoulder for some Texas Ranger to show up . I was beginning to like you , young man , and I was going to offer you a job . " " Keep it , " returned McCutcheon , without getting up . " I 'm a miserable failure , and no good to you anyhow  --  " " Who hit you over the head ? " inquired Captain Jack . " Ash Haught , " answered Beau . " I hear the Haughts are going west , " suggested Hightower . And McCutcheon sat up with a jerk . Then he sank down wearily and felt his sore head , which was wrapped up in another white rag . " Mr. McCutcheon , " went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give a young man any advice but in this case I 'll make an exception . I can use you , sore head and all , for a hundred dollars a month . For a little detective work . I stand , in a few years , to make hundreds of thousands of dollars in my business as a trail-boss ; but if this fighting keeps on I 'm liable to lose everything , and maybe get killed , to boot . Here my old friend , Martin Hockaday , that I began riding the trail with , has gone back to his old ways of stealing cows . Last year he hired some men , a bunch of buffalo hunters , to cut these herds when they passed ; but they quitThe Stampede 97him to work for another man , stealing cattle at five dollars a head . " Now he 's took on Red Ryan and his friends and they 've just trimmed this Henry Haught . But it wo n't be long till they begin to figure out that working for the boss does n't pay . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around , probably , and steal from him . The next thing you know there 'll be a range war on and a lot of good men will get killed . " " Even so , " said Beau . " Where do I come in ? " " You and your sore head , wrapped up in a white rag , are worth a hundred a month to me . The Indianswill all know you  --  cowboys and Mexicans too  --  and I just want you to ride around . Pick up all the information you can and report to me every month . Your personal affairs are nothing to me , but if you can follow this Haught outfit and find out what they 're up to , it will be satisfactory to me . I heard over on the Brazos that they hung eighteen men when they left ; but every one of those men was a cattle-thief , so that wipes the slate clean , for me . If there 's any man in the world I hate and despise  --  " " I 'll take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California led off to the west , heading for blue mountains , far away  --  the timbered heights of the Sierra Blancas . It passed through the Reservationof the Mescalero Apaches , who had only recentlybeen on the warpath , but the soldiers at Fort Stanton now had them under control , while the Government fed them beef to keep them quiet . There was rich feed from Deep Lake to the wide canyon of the Hondo , where the river disappeared , coming out on the plains below . Or that was what everybody thought . All they knew was that the stream furnished water for man and beast , until it went underground . But the herds of Henry Haught , after the stampedeof the night before , barely moved up the overlandtrail , and Beau McCutcheon went past them without being seen , taking the first road to the right at Hondo . To the left another road turned up the broad valley of the Ruidoso , leading over the mountainsto the west . But Lincoln , up the Bonito , was the town that caught all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , built up by the pres-98Lincoln 99cnce of Fort Stanton , and living chiefly by its stores and saloons . Beau 's mustang , re-named Hot Foot , took the road on a jog trot that landed them in town the same day ; and as he passed up the street every eye was upon him . He felt that he was being watched . Then a tall man with that officer-look about him rose up from his seat on a stone wall and brought him to a halt . " Where did you get that horse , young man ? " he asked and flashed his deputy 's star . " From Captain Jack Hightower , if it 's any of your business , " answered Beau , and the deputy looked him over again . " What 's the matter with your head ? " he inquired suspiciously . " Seems to me I 've seen you before . " " Not here , " returned McCutcheon , and kept on to the big corral . But as he was feeding his horse the deputy followed him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looking for a job ? " he asked , and Beau shook his head . " Just passing through , " he said . " Better stay , " advised the deputy . " It 's a live town , and no mistake . There 's a fellow down below here that 's got a beef contract . Name 's Butch Hardiganand  --  tell him I sent you . But Major O'Grady owns half the town  --  the store , the hotel and everything . Did you come up from Deep Lake today ? " i oo Bloody Head " Yes , " shrugged Beau . " Were you looking for somebody ? Perhaps you were looking for me ? " " Not at all , Mr. McCutcheon , " answered the deputy sheriff , cordially . " How 's the Captain gettingalong ? Hear you had a big stampede over at Deep Lake last night ? Was you in on it , by any chance ? " " No , " answered Beau . " I was not . Now let me ask you one . Have you got any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " replied the deputy , grinning . " Jest saw you were a stranger in town . " " Well , in that case , " said Beau , " you can pull that auger out while I get a little something to eat . " He hurried over to the lunch counter but he had hardly sat down when another officer sat down beside him . A tall man , and his badge said " Sheriff . " " About that horse , " he began . " Are you sure it did n't come from Fort Davis ? We 've had a letter from Rye Miles of the Texas Rangers  --  to look out for a bay horse with a black mane and tail  --  " " This horse is branded HT on the left hip , " broke in McCutcheon . " Are you looking for a horse with that iron ? Well , leave me alone then and let me eat this beefsteak . I came off without my break-fast . " This was no way to talk to a sheriff  --  with his deputyjust outside the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in stony silence and ordered a steak for himself . For a small town , with one store and two saloons and half the population Mexicans , itLincoln 1oiseemed to Beau to be badly overstaffed with officers . But there was something going on for , before he had finished , another important man walked in . He was a gentleman of military appearance , long mustaches and a commanding eye . A man of parts , Beau could see that at a glance , but his approach was different from the rest . " Good evening , sir , " he greeted . " I am Major O'Grady , the proprietor of this hotel . I hope you find the service satisfactory . I wonder if you could tell me about this herd , belonging to Colonel Haught , which is coming up the road ? " He smiled so affably that McCutcheon was won over from the start . " Glad to do so , " he said . " Although I do n't know the gentleman . He had a big stampede last night , lost over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I hear , so I hear , " murmured O'Grady , doubtfully . " You do n't happen to know whether he 's thinking of settling down here ? I am the owner of a large ranch down at Seven Rivers  --  a neighbor , you might say , of Martin Hockaday  --  and , naturally , I take a personal interest . Because if these Texas cowmen ever settle in these parts there 'll be more trouble than would pack hell a mile  --  if you 'll excuse the expression , Mister McCutcheon . I 'd rather have Hockaday as a friend than a neighbor . He cuts every herd that goes through Deep Lake , keeping open house to the cowmen all the time ; and for a dollar's1 o2 Bloody Headworth of beans he 'll take a thousand dollars ' worth of cattle and send you on your way with a smile . I hope old Martin is n't a personal friend of yours , because  --  " " He is , " spoke up Beau . " I 've been camping at Deep Lake for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sent a boy out every morning with a cup of coffee  --  " " That 's it ! " exclaimed O'Grady , bitterly . " But take this Haught outfit , now . He invited them right in , never charged them a cent , went to camp meeting with the women and everything . And the day they start to go he sends out his warriors and steals a thousand head of their cattle . Or fifteen hundred would be more like it , because he started a big stampedein the middle of the night and scattered them for forty miles . There 's five hundred head left on his range that never will be took , except by rustlers ; and what authority did he ever have for trimming their herd in the first place ? " " He showed Henry Haught his powers of attorneyfor a hundred and fifty brands  --  " " Showed ' em to him ! " demanded the Major ; and while they were arguing the matter there was a clatterof hoofs outside . Fifteen or twenty cowboys dropped off their horses and headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " Come over here , Jesse , " he commanded , as their leader ordered the drinks . " You 've worked for MartinHockaday  --  how did he treat you ? " Lincoln 103Jesse Mowbray was attired in the height of cowboyfashion  --  wearing velveteen trousers and two pearl-handled six-shooters . But he waited for his drink before he made reply , glancing curiously at McCutcheon the while . " Oh , fine ! " he responded , looking back at the boys , and they joined in a general laugh . " Fine as silk , " went on Mowbray . " The drinks were always free , the grub was good , bunch of Mexicans to do all the work . Only what was the use of stealing all those cattle for him when we might steal ' em for ourselves ? " " I 'll introduce you , " began the Major sternly , " to Beau McCutcheon , just up from Deep Lake . He says that Martin Hockaday has the powers of attorney for a hundred and fifty Texas brands . Ever hear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " replied Mowbray , while the cowboys gathered around . " But we never seen any ! Eh , boys ? " " Not any , " answered big Bill Nuckels . " All we had to do was cut the strays . But Martin always said he had ' em . " " Well , he 's got ' em ! " stated O'Grady . " He showed ' em to Henry Haught , and Haught let them cut his herd . Now Haught is coming west over the trail , and the question is  --  what are we going to do about it ? " " You tell ' em ! " grinned Mowbray . " What 's the answer ? " 104 Bloody Head " Push our stuff out of the way . Let ' em pass , but do n't encourage ' em to stop . That 's all , boys  --  have a drink on me . " The cowboys trooped back to the bar , Beau returned to his beefsteak and O'Grady sat in gloomy silence . " Are you friends with the Haughts ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . " I do n't want to pry into your personal affairs , " said O'Grady . " But I take it for granted you 're against them . " " It makes no difference , " answered Beau , " I 'm hitting the trail in the morning . Unless , of course , your sheriff and deputy want to ask some more questionsabout that horse . " " Certainly not , " replied O'Grady . " I 'm sorry they troubled you . Only it is rather unusual to have a man coming through that 's rode off on a Ranger 's horse . " " This horse  --  " began McCutcheon ; and then he stopped . He was going to say that Hot Foot did not belong to the Ranger , that he was a present to him from Captain Hightower as a reward for standing off the Comanches ; but if the boss of Lincoln preferred to consider him a thief it was all right with cattle detective McCutcheon . " John , " spoke up O'Grady , jerking his head at the sullen sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not come through here , but we will keep a close lookout for strangers . It is n't the first timeLincoln 105a Texas Ranger has been put afoot . But this ai n't Texas , is it ? " " No , " answered Beau , and laughed . " As a matter of fact , " smiled O'Grady , " some of our best and most useful citizens have stepped across the line ; and as long as you will answer a few questionsit will be all right with me . And , now that I 'm on the subject , I elected Sheriff Haley , personally . It is always convenient for me , however , to have a few friends on the outside , and I am especially interestedat the moment in hearing about Henry Haught . Is it a fact , do you know , that he hung eighteen men with horse-hobbles when they followed him away from the Brazos ? That is a sign of a certain determinationof character . Would you advise me to make friends with this man ? I might as well tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my command . " " You 'd better let Mr. Haught alone , " observed Beau , and O'Grady nodded gravely . " At the same time , " he went on , " there 's no escapingthe fact that he let Red Ryan cut his herd . Now , what do you think of Ryan ? " " He 's dangerous , " shrugged McCutcheon , despondently . " Stood up to Ash Haught and smashed him over the head with his six-shooter ; and if Ash had made a play he 'd have killed him . " " Ah-h ! " nodded O'Grady , " that explains things . Red is the man I 'm looking for . Well , that 's all , Mr. McCutcheon , and I 'm proud to shake hands with aio6 Bloody Headman that had the nerve to rob a Ranger . At the same time I 'd advise you to keep on going , as Rye Miles is on the prod . He has the name of being a vindictive cuss , and I reckon you know about the Rangers . When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keep going , as private citizens . " CHAPTER XIIITHE SHERIFF OF DONA ANATHERE was an element of truth in O'Grady 's remarksabout the Texas Rangers . They never let the Line stand in their way  --  just took off their badge , if they happened to have one , and kept going as privateindividuals . Beau McCutcheon remembered this when he woke up at daylight and , without stoppingfor the ham and eggs , he rode out the main street , west . It disappeared in a clump of maples and oaks and came out above a Mexican ranch . He tied Hot Foot in front of the house and had gone in to have a dish of beans , when a huge shadow fell across the doorway . " Whose harse is that ? " inquired a broad Irish voice , and McCutcheon drew his gun . " Mine ! " he answered , looking around the corner ; and his visitor burst out laughing . " No harm , " he said . " No harm at all . I was jist going by when I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my old friend , Ygenio Salazar , and I says to myself : There 's that bay harse with a black mane and tail that the boys have been looking for everywhere . ' But I was n't expecting to find you here at all , Misther  --  ah  --  Misther  --  " I07io8 Bloody Head " McCutcheon ! " answered Beau . " Ah , how do you do , Misther McCutcheon ! " hailed the stranger . " I 'm Butch Hardigan , the fort butcher at Fort Stanton . " " There 's something queer about this horse , " observedBeau impatiently . " Do you notice that HT on its hip ? I 've got a bill of sale in my pocket  --  " " To be sure . To be sure ! " exclaimed Hardigan , " but who made out this bill of sale ? Not that it matters , of carse , but you 've got your thumb over the signature . " " Yes , and I 'm going to keep it there , " stated McCutcheon , " until you go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this man that 's lost a bay horse , with a black mane and tail ? " " Why , Rye Miles , of carse . He 's searching for it everywhere . " " Anything said about a brand on its left hip , HT ? I 've been told by men who ought to know that that 's the commonest color for old-time mustangs  --  bay , with a black mane and tail . So if Mrs. Salazar will kindly give me some more beans  --  " " Oh , excuse me ! A thousand pardons ! " cried Hardigan . " When I get into Lincoln I 'll be sure to tell the byes it 's another harse , branded HT . " " Please do so , " grumbled Beau , turning back to his breakfast ; and Butch Hardigan began his line of talk . " Are you going right through Lincoln , Misther McCutcheon , " he asked , " without stopping to see The Sheriff of Dona Ana 109the town at all ? I observe by your boots you 're a cowboy , yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the countries I ever stopped in , this has got them all beat for mavericks . Thousands and thousands of them , three and four years old , the property of the first man that brands them . " As butcher for the soldiers at Fort Stanton I pay five dollars a head for steers  --  maverick steers , you understand  --  without a brand or earmark on them . ' T is a perfectly legitimate business , overseen at every point by the Government . All you have to do is bring in a bunch of mavericks  --  or others with a brand that do n't show  --  and I 'll pay you cash on the nail . " " No , I 'm sorry , " said Beau , rising up and laying a quarter on the table , " but I ca n't stop , even for five dollars . Many thanks , Mrs. Salazar , for your frijoles  --  " " What ? Are you going away ? " exclaimed Butch Hardigan ; and , behind his back , Ygenio nodded warningly . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some violent objections . Good-by , Mr. Salazar , and thanks for your kind hospitality . " He had mounted to go , carefully facing Butch ashe did so , when Hardigan made a last try . That heplanned some evil was obvious by his horse-facealone . His bulging black eyes , heavy jaw and hairyhands seemed designed by Nature to warn people . " There 's a short trail over the mountains , " he said , no Bloody Head " that will save you twenty miles at the least , if you 're going to Las Cruces . " And once more , behind his back , the friendly Mexican shook his head . " I 'm not going to Las Cruces , " Beau answered , and rode off up the trail . Mr. Hardigan had a businesslike-looking pistol , hanging low on his hip in a rawhide holster , which he seemed very anxious not to show ; yet , as well as he knew anything , Beau knew it would come out the moment he turned his back . There must be a rewardup for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in flight . The trail led on to the north and the west , in the shadow of mighty Capitan and he kept Hot Foot on the jump until they swung up over the divide . Then he turned off on a dim trail and hid out for the day , descending to the White Sands after dark . It was a valley so wide and dry that hardly a trail led across it ; yet , athwart its middle , lay a gigantic lava bed , half buried in the sands . Beau watered his horse at a well by the wayside , against the slope of the sand hills , and the next morning at dawn he saw , to the east , the dust of Henry Haught 's herd . They were driving them hard , down the winding Ruidoso , where the river led out onto the plain ; and , far away on the desert of white gypsum sand , Beau followed them to the west . In the distance McCutcheoncould see the black-trousered cowboys pushing their scattered cattle out of the way , carryTheSheriff of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear the way for these fighting invaders from Texas . In the northern end of the valley there was water , and feed and shelter , but the road led the other way to Las Cruces on the Rio Grande  --  and thence to Arizona . " Do not encourage them to stop , " had been O'Grady 's last command and the cowboys were keepingthe road open . The fact that the stage had stopped running , that all travel over the Overland Trail had ceased , made no difference to the Haughts , as they passed through the Apache Reservation . The tracks of many cattle led on ahead of them , but Jesse Mowbray and his men avoided them . The seven or eight thousand cattle were like a flight of locusts , mowing down the grass as they passed ; but as long as the Haught herds plodded on , a way was made before them . When the sun was sinking low , Beau shot a rabbit and broiled it on a stick , but while he was eating a horseman appeared and rode slowly towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Las Cruces , riding a black horse , nobly caparisoned ; a tall man with a Mexican outfit , wearing an oldfashionedbuckskin jacket . On his head was a lowcrownedsombrero , he had a rifle under his knee , and when he rode up nearer Beau stood beside his horse , for his experience with Butch Hardigan had made him wary. 112 Bloody Head " Good evening , sir , " greeted the Mexican , removing his hat , " can you tell me whose cattle those are ? I am Manuel Duran de Chaves , of Las Cruces , and my people are becoming alarmed . " " Yes , " responded Beau , " they are the herds of Henry Haught and his family , on their way to Arizona . " " Then they will have to turn back , " sighed Duran . " The stage has not crossed this week . Since the snow began to melt in the high mountains of Coloradothe Rio Grande has been flowing bank high . " " And is there no other way of crossing the river ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " there are only two fords , and the other one is quite impassable . So I fear that your friends  --  if they are your friends  --  will have to stay in this country . With so many good places to go I do not understand why they should come here where , as you see , it is nothing but desert . " " They are not my friends , " replied Beau . " In fact , half the clan are my enemies , as you can see by looking at my head . " He touched the white rag with which his scalp was bound up , and Duran stepped off his horse . " Your name is not unknown , Mr. McCutcheon , " he said . " In fact it is spoken in two languages  --  Cabeza Sangre in Spanish and Bee-tze-diltch , by the Apaches . You are the Texan named Bloody Head , who fought so bravely against the Comanches and received such a blow from a war club . You haveThe Sheriff of Dona Ana 113been waiting at Deep Lake for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to be worse . " " Yes , " admitted Beau , " I hurt it again in a fight that I had with Ash Haught . But how do you know what the Indians call me ? " " That is my business , " replied Duran de Chaves , mysteriously . " I have to know what is going on . The price of cattle has risen to twenty dollars a head ; and the Mexicans , as you know , raise cattle . I myself raise cattle , which is why it is so important to find out the truth in this affair . But the few Americans I met while watching the trail were the cowboys of Michael O'Grady , and they will tell me nothing . Except that Mr. Haught had better keep going if he wants to escape further trouble . " But how can they keep going when , at the Crossingof the Rio Grande , a good horse can hardly swim across ? It is a violent river , Mr. McCutcheon , and these Haughts are traveling with wagons . They can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried away ; so what I expect is that the Haughts will stop over and , perhaps , eat all our grass . " " Very likely , " agreed Beau , " they are no friends of mine . But you are a long way from home , Mr. Duran , and you must be a little hungry . Wo n't you have a piece of my rabbit ? " " With pleasure , my friend , " replied Duran . " Isee that you have been around , and a barnful of cornis nothing  --  at home  --  to half a tortilla , right here . " He accepted a leg of the rabbit ; and then , as an114 Bloody Headafter thought , drew out a pouch of parched corn and shared it with the Texan . " Here is a little pinole , " he said , " some ground corn mixed with panoche sugar . With a bag of this I can travel for days , but I thank you for the meat . If you will ride back with me to Las Cruces , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to water their cattle at the river that flows through Tularosa ; and then , perhaps , they will camp for the night , though I would not advise it , myself . The people at Tularosa are very jealous of their rights , and the cattle will feed off their range . But every day has its end , and you look a little tired and worn . " " My head hurts me , " replied McCutcheon , " and I slept out last night without food . So , with your permission , I will ride on to Las Cruces  --  " " You are very welcome , " answered Duran , who seemed to be built of steel and corded rawhide . " And , since you mention it , I slept out myself , without having the good fortune to kill a rabbit . But tell me about these Haughts , since we are both followingafter them . They came from the Brazos , did they not ? And when their neighbors followed along to steal their cattle they hung sixteen of them by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But Captain Hightowertold me that he thought they were fully justified . Some of these Texans , as you know , will steal anything . But not Jack Hightower . He is honest . " The Sheriff of Dona Ana 115 " Yes , he is honest , " sighed Duran . " But he has brought all these Texans upon us , so I can not say I am glad he has come . Where he goes they will followand steal all our cattle . Yet I see you are riding one of his horses . How do I know ? By this brand  --  HT on the left hip . That shows he is your friend . There is nothing so good as to ride a friend 's horse when going into a strange country . But these ignorantofficers up at Lincoln were ready to arrest you , anyway . " Yes , " agreed McCutcheon . " I do not know why , but I think there is some reward . But this horse I am riding was given to me by Captain Hightower himself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the brand does not show , and these officers are not really cattlemen . They can not read brands , as the Mexicans can , but must burn a Long Rail from ears to tail to keep their cows from being stolen . And they so cut their ears that one half stands up and the other half hangs down , so that in a herd they can always be seen . But does this absurd-looking Jingle-bob save its owner 's cattle ? Does the Long Rail keep the cow from being stolen ? No , and for a very good reason . He can not hire men enough to brand them . " They will drink , they will ride , they will cut every herd that passes ; but Martin Hockaday is always shorthanded , and there is no one to brand his stock . Have you seen Jesse Mowbray and his band of cowboys , every man dressed in black velvet , 1 16 Bloody Headwith pearl-handled pistols on his hips ? Last year they rode for him , trimming every herd of cattle that passed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for O'Grady . They are warriors . All they know is to fight . But your friend Captain Hightower is an honest man and a smart one . He does not need to steal other men 's cows . Only it was a sad day for the Mexicans when he drove that first herd to the Pecos . Because , before they get through , they will have all our range and perhaps steal all our cows . " To me it means little , since I have a store , a hotel , a mill to grind up our corn ; but my people are not rich , they have little to lose and they do not like to be treated like slaves . They settled this country first , they fought off the Indians and brought in other people to do the work . But not the Duran de Chaves . For two hundred years they have led the way in battle . They are brave  --  they will admit no defeat . A hundred to one , they would fight off the Navajos , any time ! Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cebolleta a colony of thirty families fought off five thousand Navajos for years . And when we were not fighting we would trade with them . Then organize a big party and march into their country , kill the warriors and bring home the women and children . " When a young man wished to marry he would give his intended a woman for a slave ; and so kindly did they treat them that the slaves would marry some warrior , who ran away to join them and raiseThe Sheriff of Dona Ana 117a family of his own . But no man could live in Cebolleta who turned his back in battle . No matter what the odds , they must stand up and fight ; and more than once my distinguished uncle , Don Manuel Duran de Chaves , would count out a pouch of bullets , one for every man , and lay them close to his hand . The first man to turn his back knew that Manuel would kill him , for he had a fine rifle and never missed . But perhaps , Mr. McCutcheon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recite the brave deeds of my parientes ? All is peace and quiet now , the Apaches respect me and never come to Las Cruces on their raids . But how to meet these Texans , who are swarming into our country ! But I forget  --  you are a Texan , yourself . " " Only as Captain Hightower is a Texan , " replied Beau . " He came from Virginia and joined the Texas Rangers . But the one man he hates is a cow-thief . " " Then I , too , am like him , " responded Duran . " I do not find it necessary to steal . It is only the pelados , the lower classes among my people who descendto stealing a cow . But come , let us be on our way . That is a very good horse that the Captain gave you . Did he send you into this country ? " " Well  --  maybe , " answered Beau . " If it is any of your business . " " It is , " answered Duran de Chaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County . " CHAPTER XIV , AT THREE RIVERS " IT is a good thing , " observed Duran de Chaves , " that you are seen riding into town with me . I and my brother have been sheriffs in Las Cruces for nearly twenty years . We take turns in holding office , since the New Mexican law will not permit me to serve all the time . So for two years I am sheriff and Pedro attends to our business  --  our store , our cattle and hotel . Then we change places and I run the business while Pedro runs the County . " It is only a small County , since Lincoln has been cut off , and the Apaches make us no trouble . When they fight with the soldiers they do not come down here , to kill our herders and run off our sheep . They call me Don Manuel ' and tell me everything that goes on . That is how I know just exactly what Butch Hardigan pays to hire the cowboys to bring in the steers . Five dollars a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those hides on the fence . " But when the Colonel in command at Fort Stantoncomes to make his official tour of inspection everything is perfectly regular . Major O'Grady wasII8At Three Rivers 119discharged from the service by Colonel Chevalier , who is honest , so he moved down to Lincoln , elected Haley sheriff and took entire charge of the County . Then he hired Hockaday 's cowboys , to run his Seven Rivers ranch for him , and sells his cattle to Butch Hardigan . But last year the circuit judge was murderedwhile on his way to Lincoln and Judge Brintonhas refused to hold court there . " He insists upon having all the trials in English , which the Spanish-speaking people can not understand ; so I have been compelled to summon a full panel of Americans from the cowboys along the river , and if you settle in this County I shall be very glad to summon you for the full fall term of the court . The witness fees are considerable . I receive ten cents a mile for mileage and several of the settlers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will be a good way also for you to gain information regarding the cattle-stealing that is undoubtedly going on . " " I will take it into consideration , " promised Beau , " if I happen to locate in the County . Are the Americanseasy to handle ? " " Almost too easy , " replied Duran . " When their cattle have been shipped and there is nothing else to do they come and live in town . But they make a joke of half the cases in court and have very little respect for the law . Still , the Government insists that every case shall be tried in English , and I have to take whatever Americans I can get . Since the12o Bloody Headdeath of Judge Fountain , who was killed in the White Sand here , Judge Brinton has held court in Las Cruces , and my hotel is crowded with witnesses and officers of the law . It makes a nice vacation for the boys along the river , who otherwise would be short of cash . " " I believe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they rode into Las Cruces after dark ; and from the river below he could hear the water roaring as the sand passed over the bar . There would be no crossing for the Haughts ' herds and wagons , as a rider had learned during the night , and , without attempting to cross , the cattle turned back and made their slow way to the north . Past Alamagordo and Tularosa they went at a swinging walk and at nightfallthey settled down at Three Rivers , where the water came down from the peaks . It was the end at last of their long journey across the desert in search of another range . A barren land , covered with greasewood and mesquite , set off by the black bulk of the lava beds , flanked by toweringhills to the west . Between them and these cliffs there was a waste of level land  --  the White Sands , for which the valley was famous  --  a desert upon which a jack rabbit could hardly live but covered with coarse grass toward the north . The White Sands were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept in , but anchored at the base by tall yuccas and scraggly saltbushesand rank-growing sacaton grass . Not a placeAt Three Rivers 121to build a home but good enough for raising cows , and the Haughts had been driven far enough . From the Brazos to the Pecos they had fought their way , dragging their white covered wagons behind ; but even on this desert there were people before them , who planned to drive them away . Butch Hardigan , the horse-faced Irishman who sold beef to the Government at Fort Stanton , was watching them from the heights , and he claimed this range for his own . Up the canyon there was water , flowing down from the peaks , and , at Carrizozo , Major O'Grady still ran cattle . Not many  --  it was too far from Hockaday 's vast herds and he had moved to Seven Rivers at the south  --  but it still was part of his range . His old range , almost deserted , but he claimed it for his own . When his velvet-clad warriors rode back for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roust them out , " he ordered and the range war was on , even though the Haughts did not know it . Turned back by the river , avoided at the Ruidoso , their herd trimmed by Hockaday 's Long Rail boys , they parked their wagons in a circle on the flat and set a double guard for the night . Out on the white sands they held their herds of cattle and waited for the storm to break . They were not welcome , that they knew , though their road had been cleared of every cow . It was just to get rid of them that the trail had been kept open . The cattle were up in the122 Bloody Headhills . But when they drifted down , mixing in with the trail-herds , the Haughts knew their troubles would begin . " Ride ' way out around ' em , " ordered Colonel Haught ; and the women kept close to the wagons . In a country like that , without a house in twenty miles and without a cowboy in sight , there would seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night the Haughts rode their rounds , swinging far out to turn back their enemies . And , out in the sandhills Beau and Duran slept fitfully , with nothing but pinole for food . But the watch had been too close , not a herd was stampeded , and they started for the mountains at dawn . " Let them fight , " said Manuel . " They are outside my county and Sheriff Haley knows how to handle them . When Texan fights Texan  --  " " Then comes the tug of war , " ended McCutcheon ; but Duran did not understand . " All I know , " he said , " is that the Rio Grande has been my friend . It has turned back these Texans , forty miles from Las Cruces , and they can not ford the river for a month . Now I will take you across the valley to the San Andres Mountains , where I have a place in mind where we can kill a maverick beef . From there you can look down without being observed and see everything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spring , and you can take your horse inside , since the roof of the fort is gone . It was burned , a year ago , by a band of Apache Indians , At Three Rivers 123but for you it will be perfectly safe . Only wear , when you go out , this piece of white cloth and they will know you are Bee-tze-diltch . " He passed Beau a white rag , to wrap around his head , and set out across the White Sands at a lope . The ground , most of the way , was moist and springy ; they rode around the patches of sand ; and when they reached the other side they fell into a narrow canyon that led up to a rocky pass . " This trail , " explained Duran , " is the war-trace of the Mescaleros , when they pass over the San Andresto the north . Or to the west , as far as that goes , and down over the Jornada del Muerto to Las Cruces . It is ninety miles without a drop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for that reason it is called the Journey of the Dead , after a poor fellow who tried to cross it . When he reached the other end his body was so thin that they truly thought him a dead man . Yet to a man on a horse it is no journey at all  --  just a little ride before breakfast . And that reminds me , we will kill a yearling at the pass and you can hang it up in the shade . Only do not go out for a couple of days while I send a runner to the chief . Hosteen Tla is his name  --  Left-handed Man  --  and he would like a little present when he comes . " " I will give him some tobacco , " promised Beau , and they toiled on up the steep heights . The San Andres Mountains are built up layer after layer , like a cake , with a crack down the middle at the pass ; 124 Bloody Headand at the top of the canyon there is a big spring of water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yearling , they hung it up in the shade and broiled it piece by piece on a forked stick . " This house , " said Manuel , " was built by a man named Johnson , who intended to run cattle on the west plains ; but he was afraid of the Indians and drove them away from the water . So they killed him , and burned the house . You must get some little presents and I will send you up some food , for the Indians are always hungry when they go by here . But when they know who you are they will be very glad to greet you , for already they have heard of Bloody Head . The man who struck your head with a war club was a Comanche chief and when Leopard Coat killed him , the Apaches , who were looking on , gave you a name . Always wear a white rag when you go among them and tell them you are Cabeza Sangreta . " I will tell the Comancheros , the Mexicans who trade with the Comanches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hightower and they will not do you any harm . To be killed by such a man is held an honor among the Indians , who rather expect to get killed anyway ; but they can not understand why a man should be afraid , since we all must pass out , sooner or later . But my uncle , Don Manuel Duran de Chaves , was braver than them all , and I have learned to fight like him . I remember one time  --  but I will tell the story later , since you are interestedAt Three Rivers 125in my people . Many of them are of the old sangre azul . The blood of warriors is in their veins . " But the low Texans whom we meet think the Mexicans are all the same  --  only fit for cleaning stablesand chopping wood . And yet they will fight , in their way . They have learned from the Comanches to draw their guns and charge , and the Indians are afraid of the smoke . Had they guns as good as we have  --  but enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man will come with five burros and bring you a load of food . You may pay him two dollars , if you will , for his services , and I will charge the rest to your account . Is there anything else you want ? I have a store full of supplies , as you know , and anything I have is yours . " " Then do me a favor , " smiled McCutcheon , " since I must stay here alone for days . Send me out some books to read . Have you any book written by WilliamShakespeare ? " " Shakespeare ? " repeated Duran . " I have heard the name somewhere , but I can not recall what he wrote . No , we have none , but I can send off and get you some . Just write the names on a paper . There is one book we do have , and I know it is excellent . Don Quijote de la Mancha , by Don Miguel de CervantesSaavedra . It is written in Spanish , of course  --  " " Then send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a chance to brush up on my language . You speak English so well that  --  " " Ah , thank you a thousand times , " answered Du-126 Bloody Headran , riding off . " I am glad to practice with the words . Until tomorrow , then , my friend , and I hope you find the one you seek . The lady , who is with the Haughts . Yes , at your age there is always a lady . " He laughed as McCutcheon began to blush , and galloped away down the trail . CHAPTER XV , SERGEANT MILESWITHOUT waiting for the two days to pass , when he would be safe from Indian attacks , Beau rode around the point and gazed out across the western plains . The trail that led across it had been named the Journeyof the Dead Man . Many men had died there , with water but a few miles away , for it was confined at the bottom of the canyon . Yet the broad mesa was green with grass and flowers , with mesquite trees , greasewood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn deep by wild cattle , who found shelter on the wooded heights . Except for the passing Indians it was an ideal place to live  --  the only sweet water in miles . Before the Apaches killed him , Johnson had built a cedar corral , around the spring , just down the canyon . But he had driven away the Indians , after they had used the water for centuries , and an arrow had ended his life . Now his homestead lay waiting for the next man to take a chance on it , and McCutcheon posted his notices . From the edge of the cliffs that night Beau could see the fires that blazed in the guarded Haught camp ; and there , standing beside one of them , was Musette herself , though she did not know he wasI27128 Bloody Headwatching . Never since that night when he had struck back at Ash and fought him until the stampedeshook the earth ; never since that night had he seen the little girl who had taken him for her knight . Out of the rush of cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mare bucking , dragged by one foot  --  and with the pistol he always wore he had shot the horse down and taken her into his arms . Then a rough hand had slapped him over , Mrs. Haught had struck him aside , and he had ridden off after Hightower 's herd . Then the Comanches rode out on them , there was a swift whirl of racing horses , and Beau had charged into their midst . That was the way his father had taught him  --  never to wait , to fear nothing , and to go for the nearest man . It was the way of the Texas Rangers learned from Sam Houston and Jack Hays and the rest of that impetuousband . It was Hightower 's way , though he was not born in Texas , and in a fight he always noticed those in front . That was why he had seen McCutcheon and charged in to help him . It was why Beau was working for him now . There were other Texans as brave , but not all of them were as honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wanted men he could trust in that tumult of fighting and stealing , in that welter of mavericks , running wild without a brand . That was why McCutcheon was staying at Johnson'scanyon with his head wrapped up in a rag . But below , at last , they had come to rest  --  MuSergeantMiles 129sette and the whole family of Haughts  --  and there was one Haught already who wanted to marry her . Some cousin , for they kept within the clan . A turbulentlot , quick to take up a quarrel ; but Hightower had decided they were honest . Honest among themselves , though they had hung eighteen neighbors . But still , as cowmen went , they were square . Ash was the fighting one , who had learned to shoot lefthanded , so he would not get a bullet through his heart . He had had his head battered twice in one day , and once by Beau McCutcheon . And Beau was still wearing a rag over his wound , for Ash had hit him hard . He had sent word to Beau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he meant it . But with the Lincoln County boys on his trail , Ash would have enough fighting to do . Major O'Grady had fought the Apaches for three years himself , and his warriors had been picked , to a man . They were making big money and they knew their business , which was to move strange outfits off the range . Move them quick , before they got located  --  and the second night they started a stampede . Beau was still out on the cliff , looking down across the wide valley at the twinkling fires of the camp when , without the least warning , every cow at once , the Haught cattle rose up and flew . There was some way of starting them , learned perhaps from the Apaches , that put them all on the jump . They poured out across the valley with a roar like the130 Bloody Headclatter-gates of hell , turning to the right as the naught cowboys took after them and headed them through the white sands . Then , halfway to the Ruidoso , the pistols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the shooting was over the cattle were still running , but at last they came to a stop . At dawn they were toiling back again through that ocean of drifting sand , and an Indian was riding up the trail . His stunted pony was shod with rawhide horseshoes that clung to the rocks as he came on , but when he saw this white man , with a rag around his head , calmly waiting at the head of the trail he halted and held up his hand . " How , " he said , whipping closer . " Bueno ! " That was to say : Good ! ' He came good . " Don Manuel say you good man ! " he continued . " Cabeza Sangre , no ? " " Yes , " answered Beau , holding up his hand for peace . And he beckoned him on to the house . Then he pointed to the beef , where it hung in the corner , and the Indian cut off a strip . He cooked it , saying nothing , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a Mexican came in at noon he looked at the horse-tracks and shrugged . " Apache , " he said , stepping down from his burro ; and glanced up at the peaks as he spoke . " Scare cows ? " asked McCutcheon , pointing down into the valley where the scattered cattle were being driven back , and the Mexican shrugged again . Sergeant Miles 131 " Quien sabe , " he grunted . " Who knows ? " Here was an answer to the mysterious stampede , so similar to the one at Deep Lake . At the smell of an Indian , coming down the wind , every cow-brute had leaped to its feet . It was explanation enough for Beau , who had seen Comanche stampedes before , and he went on unpacking the loads . Then he brewed a pot of coffee , motioned the Mexican to drink , and stacked up his provisions by the fireplace . " Comido , " he said , and watched old Juan eat while he looked through the collections of books . They were all in Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ha ! " he exclaimed . " Don Quijote ! " " Yes , yes , " responded Juan . " A good book . Very old . The story of Don Quijote and his squire , SanchoPanza . The only book Don Manuel will read . He says that reading is bad for the eyes , and it is necessary for him to shoot straight . " " A thousand thanks , " answered McCutcheon . " Here is a letter for your patron . Please ask him to mail it for me and I will wait till I hear from my boss . " " To be sure , " replied Juan and , with a last sip of coffee , he started off down the trail . Beau was still in the stone house  --  where he could look out the broken window and see anyone coming up the trail  --  when he jumped up and reached for his gun . Up the trail  --  and he knew him  --  was his pet horse , Hot Foot , who had borne him so fast132 Bloody Headand far when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his back , was Rye Miles , leaning forward and looking for tracks . But behind him was CaptainHightower . McCutcheon stepped out , smiling , though his heart was in his mouth , and Miles regarded him grimly . " Sergeant Miles , " said Hightower , spurring forward , " shake hands with Beau McCutcheon . " " Glad to meet you , sir , " answered Miles , without shaking hands . " Are you the man that stole my horse ? " " We sent him right back , Rye , " defended Jack , " as soon as we found a man we could trust . With a horse as good as that , and heading towards the Line , it would n't pay to take any chances . " " Well  --  no , " agreed the Ranger . " With those hombres we saw when we went through Lincoln I was lucky to get him back at all . Never mind about petting him , Mr. McCutcheon , if you do n't mind . I 'm mighty particular about that horse . Best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had the nerve to grab him that night . But the Captainexplained that it was all a mistake and  --  well , all right ! " and he shook hands . " Now , boys , " began Hightower , " I 've left a big herd of cattle to get you located and started on this work . The Cattlemen 's Association have decided to spare no expense . There were two men killed last night in the first scrimmage with the Haughts and the Seven Rivers boys were whipped off . ButSergeant Miles 133this is only the beginning . They 've got a big bunch of warriors , the profits are good and Sheriff Haley runs the town . I want you to find out who is starting these stampedes and co-operate with the Haughts all you can . " " That 's easy , " replied Beau . " They 're started by an Indian named Hosteen Tla  --  and the sheriff of Dona Ana , Manuel Duran , will take care of him . But who the hell can co-operate with that Haught outfit  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rye Miles , confidently . " I 'll tame ' em . They made the mistake of stepping across the line from Lincoln County , where the whole damned Government is crooked , but what are the Rangers for ? " " They are to straighten out , " said Hightower , " just such feuds as this before they result in bloodshed , and it 's my opinion there 'll be war in a month , and I 'm going to send for two more men . Get the jump on ' em at the start , before these killings be-gin  --  " " They 've done started already , " objected Miles . " Two men killed last night , and both Seven Rivers warriors . But I 'm going right over there and throw in with these Haughts and  --  " " Anyway you please , Rye , " agreed Hightower pacifically . " But do n't think for a minute it will be easy . These are the same Haughts that hung eighteenneighbors with horse-hobbles  --  " " That 's all right , " came back Miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Haughts are honest it 's O.K. with me , as old Stonewall Jackson used to say . The circuit judge is coming to Lincoln next month and I 'm going to make some arrests . " " There 's a young lawyer in Lincoln that will handle our cases , " remarked Hightower , looking out the window . " But what cattle are these , Beau , that are coming in to water ? And not a single cow branded ! That 's the greatest single cause of all this stealing  --  these mavericks roaming the plains . MartinHockaday is going to find it is absolutely impossible to keep his cattle branded at all . Because , with these Texas trail herds going out and a good market in the north , he ca n't keep his men a month . All they 've got to do is slap their brand on every maverick and sell it for twenty dollars . " Now , Beau , " said the Captain , " the first thing I want you to do is trap these wild cattle and brand them . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to , but we can talk that over later . And if any cows come in that have got a Texas brand on them , seize them and send them out to the first herd going through and we 'll pay half what you get to the owners . That 's what Martin Hockaday is supposed to do , but he never keeps any books . Just grabs them and keeps the money and you ca n't blame him too much , the way these rustlers are trimming him . But , when it 's too late , he 's going to regret this . Raising the damdest bunch of cow-thieves the world has ever seen , and they'reSergeant Miles 135getting worse all the time . Red Ryan will stop a team of oxen , slap the Fence Rail on their ribs and turn them out on the range . And if the Mexicans make any protest he 'll burn a Fence Rail on their rump and jingle-bob their ears . That boy is a bad one  --  a good-hearted kid , but with no more principlesthan a rattlesnake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to be trouble . That 's all , Beau . Be careful , Rye . And never forget you 're a Ranger . " CHAPTER XVIEVERY MAN A GENERAL " You heard him , " said Miles , as Hightower rode away , " but with the Rangers every man is a general . Go ahead and trap your mavericks , if you want to . I 'll ride over and see that Haught outfit . " He poured out some corn to feed Hot Foot , broiled a strip of beef on a stick and rode off without saying good-by . Rye was a man of action , six feet tall and built in proportion , with a shock of bristling red hair that stood out under his hat like a halo . His eyes were steel blue , with that deceptively mild look that so often goes with his kind ; until the time for action came and then his good humor was gone . He had not forgiven Beau McCutcheon , even yet , for riding off on his horse ; and when he came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broiled some beef , saying nothing . " Why the hell did n't you tell me she was there ? " he asked at last ; and Beau laughed and looked away . " I knew you 'd see her , " he said . " Is n't she the prettiest little girl you ever saw in your life ? " 136Every Man a General 137 " Little ! " exclaimed Miles , stopping to stare . " She 's five foot ten if she 's an inch . The finest-looking woman I ever saw , but she could pole-axe a bull with one hand . Say , who is this Barney Hoops who thinks he 's so important ? I damned near had a fight with him at the start . He followed me to my horse and tried to warn me off  --  said Odette was his girl , and all that , but  --  " " Oh , " broke in Beau . " You mean Odette ! " " W'y , sure I mean Odette . Who else could I mean ? So I told Mr. Hoops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Did n't you see Musette ? " clamored Beau . " A little girl with brown eyes and lots and lots of dark hair and  --  " " Oh  --  her ! " grunted Miles . " That little girl ? She was sitting over there with her grandmother and never said a word . But just when I went to go she slipped a note in my pocket and , so help me God , you could 've knocked me down with a feather , she had such a look in her eye . Then this Barney Hoops followed after me and  --  well , here 's your note . I 'm eating . " He reached into his leather vest above the two pistols that swung so handy at his hips and as Beau looked at the note he closed his eyes and sighed . " Well , what does it say ? " demanded Miles and McCutcheon handed it over . " It is the lark and not the nightingale , ' " mut-138 Bloody Headtered Rye , and passed it back impatiently . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's a bird , " explained Beau . " Yes , but what does it mean ? " insisted Miles . " And why did she pass it to me ? I thought for a minute that I 'd made a winning with both of them when I only wanted one , she had such a look in her eyes . And then this Barney Hoops , that had been watching for his chance , had the nerve to warn me away from her . From Odette , I mean , and him a big , fat slob  --  but a fighting man , I reckon  --  and that 's the only reason I did n't hit him . All the other men were out , standing guard over the herd , but he had plenty of time . All the time there was , and I noticed in particular how he never took his eyes off of her . And she sitting there so innocent , as if she never saw him . He 's some relation , I reckon . " " Second cousin on her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " A holy terror . I could see that from the start . They were all sitting around the fire , when I rode in and Barney Hoops jumped up . He was a kind of a guard , I reckon  --  asked me my business and everything  --  butI never got a chance to tell him anything . Because every woman there knew Hot Foot , and they all asked where you were . That 's something I never do is let women pet my horses , but when she came over , just as smiling and confident , and rubbed him on the nose  --  Well , I looked into her eyes , and they 're a violet blue  --  " Every Man a General 139 " Did Musette ask for me ? " demanded Beau . " She might 've , " responded Miles . " There were so many of them talking I never noticed . Those women had n't seen a man for a month  --  except their own kin , of course  --  and I answered them all at once . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't get a word in edgewise . First she told about naming all her children . A fortune-teller had advised her that her lucky names would all end with ette . Odette , Musette , Jeanette and all the rest of them , and her son 's lucky name ended in elles . She called him Ashheels  --  he was a famous Greek fighting man  --  but I never even heard of him . " Then she began to talk about this terrible Red Ryan , and what a bad man he was , and I said Red had come in with my pardner , when he made his escape from Fort Davis . That set ' em all off  --  you must have insulted Musette  --  " " I did not , " denied Beau . " She 's the sweetest little girl in the world and old Gram took her out to see me " Well , anyhow , this Red Ryan got gay with Odette and she slapped him over backwards  --  " " Yes , I know , " broke in McCutcheon , " but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found out , " answered Miles , " that we 're going to have neighbors . The Haughts have had a bunch of Mexicans , mixing mud and molding adobe bricks ; and in another week 's time they 'll have a regular fort , with a big oak gate and everything . Then140 Bloody Headthey 'll all move inside and if I want to see Odette  --  " He wandered on and Beau almost stopped listening to him , he was so interested to hear from Musette . His little girl was there and he was still her brave knight . She was still reading Shakespeare and talking about Romeo and Juliet , though Rye had never heard of them . Miles jumped up on his horse and went racing across the mesa , and when he came back it was in the company of Manuel Duran . " Good morning , " greeted Don Manuel . " I have brought out some books for you , and Mr. Miles has been so kind as to tell me about Henry Haught , who is building a fort down at Three Rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle will range inside of it ; and I was wondering if he would object if we levied a nominal assessment . " " Oh , are you the sheriff ? " inquired Miles , as Beau accepted the books ; and half an hour later , when he looked up from his reading , they were talking about fighting Apaches . " This is Manuel Duran , " said Rye . " Of the most famous fighting Durans of New Mexico . His uncle was a Colonel in the Civil War , after Armijo had quit , and Don Manuel tied into Colonel Price lonehandedwith about a thousand New Mexicans , and ran him out of the state . W'y , hell , he 's got these Apaches so badly licked they 're afraid to come down out of the hills . Unless they get his personal per-mission . " Every Man a General 141 " Yes , I know , " answered Beau . " Their chief was through here yesterday and ate a bellyful of meat , and : I noticed how respectful he was . Tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring his wife along and stay awhile . I want him to ask her to make a buckskin suit for a little lady I know . And tell him I 'll pay for it , handsomely . Would fifty dollars be enough ? " " Oh , plenty  --  if he likes you , " smiled Manuel . " Have you found your girl , at last ? The Indian women , as you know , are afraid of American men ; but if you will allow him to bring two of his wives " Fine , " laughed McCutcheon . " And I will ask him to take them over to Haught 's fort , to fit the little lady , Miss Musette Haught . " " I will do so , " promised Duran . " After a few days have elapsed , of course . I am informed by my mozo , Juan , that he had seen Tla 's tracks by your spring , and that you understood what his errand had been . Jesse Mowbray hired him  --  I am sure you understand  --  but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were killed . So , after a few days , I will send Tla over here and you can give him a little meat . But be sure to give him an unbranded animal or Mr. Hardigan will object . He has the Governmentcontract , you know , to keep these Indians in beef ; but I am afraid that Mr. Hardigan does not feed them very well . For , though he is paid on issue day for feeding fifteen hundred Apaches , there are142 Bloody Headnever more than seven hundred , and even then he never has enough . " Don Manuel smiled easily as he stepped down from his horse but , just before he left , he inquired if Red Ryan was in the employ of Captain Hightower . " I might just as well tell you , " he said , " that we had a visit from Ryan last week , with a company of ten or twelve warriors , as he calls them . A band of Comanches had driven off several hundred steers from the herd of a Texas trail-man , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down below Las Cruces , disposing of their cattle to a band of comancheros , which is the name we have for the Mexican traders who exchange beads and sugar for beef . " These comancheros are known to the Comanches , " he went on , " who for many years have raided into Texas ; and , although it is dangerous , they go out to meet them and trade them blankets and whisky . Or perhaps a few rifles , a little ammunition  --  I do not know for myself . They are a low class of pelados , but brave , or they would not venture out there ; and when Ryan and his men rode up on them they had a little fight . Three Indians were killed  --  one Mexican , also  --  and the Americans took all the cattle . But whether they delivered them to Martin Hockaday is something I do not know . " " They did not , " spoke up Miles . " I was throughEvery Man a General 143Deep Lake only yesterday and Red Ryan had just come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just the scalps of three Comanches  --  " " Ah ! Aha ! " shrugged Don Manuel ; and he gallopedaway down the trail . CHAPTER XVIIA LAWYER " THESE warriors , " observed Miles , " are all the same . They trim every herd for mavericks and strays and then they turn around and steal the strays themselves , though I had n't heard about the comancheros . But Jesse Mowbray and his men operate at Seven Rivers , which is halfway down the Pecos towards El Paso . I wonder if , by any chance , they are buying beef from Red . " " Do n't think so , " replied Beau . " They 're working for Major O'Grady and he 's trying to keep things to himself . But when he tackled the Haught boys they were a little too much for him , although Hosteen Tla is scared out . " " I went over there , " volunteered Miles at last , " with the idea of putting in with them , but the only man I saw was Barney Hoops and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 've got to have some fighting men and the Haught boys are reasonablyhonest . We could use them , Beau , if we ever had a run-in and had to take on Jesse Mowbray . But I want to know what Red Ryan is up to before I make another move . Except to see Odette , of course . I ca n't let this Barney run it over me. " 144A Lawyer 145 " No indeed ! " agreed McCutcheon . " And while you 're about it  --  " " You steal your own girl ! " bantered Miles . " The Captain would give us hell , if he knowed . A Texas Ranger ai n't supposed to have a wife . Or a home or nothing else . He 's supposed to ride around all over the state of Texas , being transferred as soon as he 's known , but when I meet a girl like Odette  --  " " Or Musette , " added Beau ; and they laughed . Rye worked a little while , helping Beau brand up the mavericks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail and did n't come back for four days . " What do you think now ? " he asked . " A band of Comanches raided Deep Lake last night and ran off every horse they 've got . And before Red Ryan had his men remounted they were halfway to the Guadelupes . They were Comanches , I know , because they used a knotted reata to saw their way through that adobe corral . Cut out a big section and passed the horses through , one at a time . The ground was stomped flat with moccasin tracks and there was n't an Apache tewa in the bunch . The moon was just past the full , too , and there was n't a chance to ketch up on them . " But Martin Hockaday was good and mad  --  he lost a hundred and fifty-four horses  --  and he 'd just found out where they take them . Away down on the Rio Grande , below Las Cruces , where those Mexican comancheros hang out . Red had traced the Comanchesright to them ; so , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin enlisted a big bunch of buffalo-hunters that was going through and started down to make a clean-up . Grab every Comanche cow that had a Texas brand on it , and use his powers of attorney . The old zinc pipe is tied on the back of his saddle and Martin has got blood in his eye . He 's even wearing his six-shooters ; and when he does that he means business . " He spilled out a feed of corn for Hot Foot , grabbed a sackful of jerked beef and set off without lookingback and , after thinking it over , McCutcheon went on with his work . There was branding to do , someone had to do it ; and Miles belonged to the Rangers , where every man was a general . He did not feel the need of any company , but headed off alone for Las Cruces . Two days went by , there was a big dust to the south , and then an enormous herd of cattle came in sight , surrounded by American cowboys . This would be a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been buying stolen cattle for years ; but Hockadayhad hung on his pistols and hired every cowboy on the Pecos . The cows came back in a long line , heading for the Ruidoso , and somewhere in the bunch was Rye Miles , who had been trained to be a general . When he returned , without a doubt , he would have a tally of the whole herd , and he would claim them in the name of Texas . Martin Hockaday had been claiming them , but he never sent any back . A Lawyer 147Now the Cattlemen 's Association had brought the law into the country . They were going to sell the steers to the first herd passing through , and send half the profits to the owners . Everybody knew them  --  there were half the brands in Western Texas  --  but Hockaday never kept any books . And the rustlers were all stealing from him . Jesse Mowbray was selling mavericks for five dollars a head to Butch Hardigan , and he was selling them to the Government . But an inspector had just counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quite a difference between that and fifteen hundred ; and the Mescaleros did n't like beef , anyway . They preferred horse-meat , and the Comancheshad shown them how to get it . Sergeant Miles had the feeling that he was making himself very unpopular when , at the end of the long drive , he introduced himself officially . And when he claimed the steers in the name of Texas he nearly started a riot . There were rustlers on the Pecos who had never heard of the law until Captain Hightower came into the country . He had started it all by refusing to accept the mixed herd that Lester and John had picked up on the open plains , and Hockaday was vexed . After taking sixty men to Las Cruces and back ; and nearly having a fight with the Mexicans , to have a man step in and claim the whole herd was something out of the ordinary . Still , Rye Miles had his papers from the Western Cattlemen 's Association148 Bloody Headand he might have made good on his bluff had not another stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , with stooped shoulders and a visionary eye  --  a lawyer , in fact  --  and after a few words with Hockaday he stepped back and smiled . " Your papers are all right , Mr. Miles , " said Martin . " It was only under a great extremity that I undertook to seize these cattle at all . But I have just suffered the loss of every horse in my corral at the hands of these same Comanches , and when we arrived on the scene here were these Mexicans , half of them riding around on our mounts . The other half of the horses had been killed to provide a feast for the Comanches and , under the circumstances , I feel I am fully justified in taking all the stock . " " Sure is , " chipped in Red Ryan . " And where do we come in ? Ai n't we got a legal claim to half these steers , for taking them away from the Injuns ? " " And gentlemen , " suggested the lawyer , whose name was Sweeny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to these powers of attorney . In no place is it specified when the cattle shall be sold and when the money shall be paid to the owners . And since , in this case , time is the essence of the contract  --  " " I wo n't pay it , that 's all , " stated Hockaday . " I 've been robbed once , back in Texas , by a gang of thieving lawyers , who took advantage of my signing a lot of papers to collect every dollar I had . I went bankrupt in Texas and came out to this country toA Lawyer 149get another start in life ; and no lawyer  --  not even this one  --  is going to make me pay . Those notes and bills of sale that they 're holding against me have been outlawed , years ago ; and as long as I stay outside the state of Texas  --  " " Three cheers ! " bellowed Ryan , " for Martin Hockaday ! " And they all went in for a drink . CHAPTER XVIIITHE HAUGHTS GIVE WARNING " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send this country to hell if somebody does n't kill them off . That little shrimp is Bryan Sweeny , the one Hightower spoke of , over in Lincoln , and he 's been tagging along for forty miles , just for the chance to get in a word . I heard him telling Hockaday that what he needed was a good , smart attorney , to look after his legal interests . " " Keeping me out of jail , ' " says Martin , " and he gave me a look when I rode off . They 've got me spotted now for a Texas Ranger , and half of them are on the dodge . When I came by the Haught fort on my way home , this same Barney Hoops was standing at the door ; and he waved me on , like this . They think you 're an outlaw , of course . " " Did you see Musette ? " asked Beau . " No , nor Odette , either , " grumbled Miles . " But I saw old Gram and chief Tla and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gram , she waved her hand to me . " " Oh , I know ! " cried Beau . " They 're down measuringMusette for that buckskin suit I ordered. 150The Haughts Give Warning 151Gram 's going to boss the job , and I gave Tla the fifty dollars . " " Well , where do you come in , buying clothes for Musette ? " demanded Miles . " You must figure on getting married ! " " We do , " nodded Beau . " As soon as she 's sixteen , and she 's going on fifteen now . She gave me a kiss and promised to wait for me , and right here is where we 'll make our home . I 've staked out a homestead already and  --  " " Located the water ? " inquired Miles . " I see you 've branded all these cows . You 're not so crazy as you look , Mr. McCutcheon , with your head all tied up in a rag . This is the only good spring in the country , too  --  the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fifty miles , " boasted Beau . " Did you see those Haught cattle down below ? Just waiting for a chance to get a good drink  --  and all the other cows , too . Once they sneak in and get a good taste they 'll always come back for more , and this mesa up here is covered with grass . " " Yes , " observed Miles , sarcastically . " If the Indiansdo n't kill you  --  " " Old Tla is my friend , " objected Beau . " He came over yesterday , and his old wife is going to make a dress . She says the young girl does n't know how to work in buckskin , but she 's a pretty little thing . Never looked up , the whole time she was here  --  " ' 152 Bloody Head " If you could only earn a living , " went on Rye relentlessly , " you could almost afford to get mar-ried . " " Got that cinched , already , " laughed McCutcheon . " Been summoned for a professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these Mexicansbarred . He 's got some important cases coming up , when we crack down on these cow-thieves , and he wants only men that understand English . Then there 's ten cents a mile mileage , for going to town and back , and expenses while I 'm serving on the jury . With my hundred dollars a month as an undergroundagent , and all the mavericks I 'm going to brand  --  " " Well , you 'll do , " pronounced Miles , " until CaptainHightower gets back to town , and then he 'll be sending you all over seven counties . But what are you going to do with Musette , when you get summonedto Las Cruces , to sit on those juries you spoke of ? " " I 'll take her , too ! " smiled McCutcheon . " That is , when we 're married ; and every time the Indians come through I 'll tell them to help themselves to beef . They ca n't burn the house down , anyway ; because it 's been burned down once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But if you knew what I do , you would n't feel quite so good . When Red Ryan and his warriors left Deep Lake , they took half the stolen cattle with them , and when I went through Lincoln , Haley tried to hire me forThe Haughts Give Warning 153five dollars a day . Professional gunman , and Butch Hardigan is hiring more , but I told them I was on my way . When they hear what I tried to pull on Martin Hockaday they 'll run me out of town . I 'm a marked man already , on account of my horse , but when they hear I 'm working for Hightower  --  I believe I 'll stay home for a while . " " All right , " agreed Beau ; and the next morning at daylight they were building a cattle-trap . It was just a gap in the corral , where the wild cattle could squeeze in between limber cedar poles , set sideways in the breach . They came down at night from the timbered peaks and , once inside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Haught and his son rode up , and they looked at the hot irons disdainfully . " What 's the matter ? " demanded Haught . " Ca n't you boys throw a rope , or are you working Mexican style ? " " We 're working Mexican style , " answered Beau , and kept his eye on Ash . " I notice , " went on Haught , " jest as soon as I get settled , you start in branding cows . Moving in on me , like , but I warn you right now to leave my cattle alone . " " Our orders , " spoke up Miles , " from the President of the Western Texas Cattlemen 's Association , are to brand every calf in the iron of its mother and take all the mavericks for ourselves . Any objections to that ? " 154 Bloody Head " None whatever , " returned Henry Haught grimly , " as long as you do that ; but our cows are coming up here to get a drink of water and be damned careful what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand of mine altered  --  " " Be careful what you say , " warned McCutcheon , " or I 'll bounce a stone off your head . And you Ash , I 've been watching you , so do n't reach for that gun unless you mean to use it . " " Never mind , now , " retorted Haught . " We came up here peaceful , to see what these cattle were waiting for . Why do n't you build a fence , if you want to keep them out , instead of baiting them into a trap . I know your record , young man  --  " " Yes , and you know mine , " replied Rye Miles , drawing his gun . " I 'm a sergeant in the Texas Rangers . And by the way , I know your record . " He waved them away scornfully , but Henry Haught bristled back at him . " My record is well known , " he admitted . " But this is n't Texas , young man . I 'm proud of what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To cow-thieves . And , just to show you I mean it , I 'm offering five hundred dollars reward for the arrest and conviction of any man caught stealing my cows . " " Good enough , " answered the Ranger , " I 'll try to remember that . But do n't you think , Mr. Haught , you 're taking a good deal for granted when  --  " " I 'm warning you ! " shouted Haught , his voiceThe Haughts Give Warning 155trembling with passion . " I 've lost three thousand head of cows since I came into this country and I warn you to stay away . And keep away from my daughters or  --  " " Or what ? " demanded Miles , boldly . " I 'll call on your daughters whenever I damned please , and do n't try to run any ranikaboos over me . " " Come on ! " said Ash to his father , " before you get gun-shot by this tough hombre , here , Mr. McCutcheon . He 's just waiting for the chance to plug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm waiting for you to make a crooked move , if that 's what you mean , " answered Beau . " But if you can ever find a calf that I misbranded  --  " " You do n't need to misbrand calves , " retorted Ash , " as long as you can find full-grown mavericks . You and your Captain Hightower , that 's so honest he leans over backwards  --  " " That 'll do , " warned Miles , " and you 'd better be on your way before something happens to you . You 've got plenty of people to fight , without corningclear up here . Red Ryan and his warriors have quit Martin Hockaday and  --  " " They have ? " yelped Ash Haught . " When ? " " Yesterday morning . Taking half Hockaday 's Texas cattle ! " " We 'll be going , " decided Henry Haught , and started down the trail on the run . " I think I 'll go over and investigate that slaughter-156 Bloody Headhouse , " murmured Miles , " while Butch Hardigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other rat-killing to do that 'll require his immediate at-tention . " CHAPTER XIXA LITTLE HELL OF THEIR OWNA POSSE of twenty men , armed with rifles and pistols and mounted on the best of horses , was gathered beforeSheriff Haley 's office , passing the bottles around . The work they had to do did not call for cold courage but rather the reckless kind , and Mexicans and Americans alike had set out to get one man . He was an innocent-looking fellow , this J. Rogers Ismay , an Englishman , unaccustomed to the ways of the West but carried away by the love of adventure ; and when Red Ryan had dropped in at his ranch on the Rio Feliz with a big herd of Texas cattle it seemed only the usual thing . He had known these doughty warriors who rode for Martin Hockaday , fighting off Indians and Texans alike when the occasion came to do so , and he had never seen one of them weaken . And he had known the little lawyer , Bryan Sweeny , who did not fear even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he and Ismay , drawing the trade from O'Grady 's big store , and neither of them had experienced a tremor . Yet he knew , without thinking about it , that the Major157158 Bloody Headowned the town , and that he was opposed to Sweeny and his policies . For Sweeny had had the effrontery to refuse a certain case on the ground that it was not honest  --  and O'Grady a man who had fought the Apaches , neither expecting nor giving quarter ! It was a hard formation , though Ismay did not know it , and he set off for Lincoln alone . But as he rode down the trail towards Lincoln he met these men who had been his friends and , before he could even ask them for a drink , one of them had shot him off his horse . They were drunk , of course , and they shot the horse too , although all they were instructed to do was to serve a writ of attachment . But twenty men were not called for to do the work of an attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had the nerve to oppose O'Grady in everything , and the time had come for a showdown . There were getting to be too many men foolish enough to lay down their little deuce against the hand of a man who held aces , a man accustomed to rule by any means , fair or foul , and Sweeny had gone too far . He had solicited the legal practice of Martin Hockaday and won him over to the law . When everybody knew that O'Grady ruled the town , and the law had nothing to do with it . Even Hockaday knew that much ; but he had retainedSweeny , all the same , after his last bunch of warriors quit him . And Martin for years had been opposed to all lawyers , with their wise saws andA Little Hell of Their Own 159legal verbiage , putting his trust in an old iron safe , named for some reason the Salamander safe . So far it had served him well  --  no one else knew the combination  --  butthis last raid on his herds by the Western Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he had been ready to weaken and even give back the branded steers , Sweeny had laid his finger on the essential weakness even of his powers of attorney . These papers which he had treasured for years in his section of zinc water pipe  --  even flashing them on Henry Haught and stripping Haught 's herd of every stray ! Sweeny had revealed at a glance that they had no authority before the law , because they had not specified when . It was taken for granted that , after seizing the stolen steers , he would sell them and restore one-half to the distant , half-forgotten owners . But Red Ryan had shown him a higher law when he had driven half the herd away . He could have taken them all , but he rather admired this little lawyer who had the nerve to stand up to the Western Cattlemen 's Association ! So they left him half their herd , to see if he could keep them when Hightower came back with more men . They were all hiring gunmen , and Hightower was hiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlaws and shoot it out , man to man . Rye Miles had played a lone hand in the cause of the Associationand the law , but Bryan Sweeny had raised his limber finger and put it on the spot . He had shown16o Bloody Headthem that these powers of attorney were as nothing . They did not specify when the money was to be paid . That was the same as saying that they would never be paid , and Ryan saw his chance to quit . He was going to quit , anyhow , but he had never for a minute expected that he could get away with it lawfully . A man like this lawyer would come in very handy if they ever had courts again ; but since the death of Judge Fountain , the prosecuting attorney , who had been killed just before the former court , it looked as if they would revert to first principles : " When they shall take who have the power And they shall keep who can . " But when , the next day , they found J. Rogers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they realized that the war was on . Red Ryan and his warriors had been heading for Lincoln when they came upon Sweeny 's partner , dead ; and when they saw five of O'Grady 's men in the distance they charged in like fighting Comanches . Two men split off from the rest and tried , as fellow outlaws , to make peace , but Red Ryan was implacable . " No , " he said , " you killed my pardner and laid him by his horse to make fun of him . Now tell me if you think this is funny . " He killed them both and took an oath to kill the rest of them  --  a large order , there were twenty ofA Little Hell of Their Own 161them  --  but before Red Ryan got through he had killed just twenty men . Not those particular men , but any others he happened to hit ; and , while he was doing it , he made the law a joke in his easy , care- free way . Even the Governor of New Mexico could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once the pot had been opened , and he knew they would kill him anyway ; so he shot these two men , just to show what he could do , and even Captain Hightower was thwarted . For months he had seen this war coming on and had aroused the Association to move against it . They had sent in two men , and one of them a Ranger , hired sixty gunmen , raided the Mexican settlements but Martin Hockaday had spoiled it all . He hadand seized every steer that had a Texas brand ; but the men he had hired had turned against him and started a little hell of their own . CHAPTER XXTHE BATTLEFIRST they had sworn out warrants against each other , still clinging to a pretense of law , but the first two men were killed . They went on hiring gunmen , swearing out more warrants , recruiting ardent friends for the fray . But the last prosecuting attorney had been killed while going to court and nobody would take his place . The word was passed around that a conspiracy had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Bristol would not come to Lincoln to open the circuit court . The courtroom was at the top of a two-story building , the first floor being O'Grady 's store ; there was no jail worthy of the name ; and if court was ever called , people felt morally certain that the meeting of the clans would start a war . At present all was quiet , although Sheriff Haley had offered a reward for Red Ryan , dead or alive , on account of the killing of two men . Whereas Ryan held Haley personallyresponsible for the shooting of his English friend Ismay . Haley it was who had sent twenty men , all depu-162The Battle 163tized , to serve a writ of attachment on Ismay 's prop- erty , over on the Rio Feliz . They had shot him down without even a pretense of demanding that he should surrender , and as a joke they had laid him out beside the body of his horse , with his coat under his horse 's head . This as a taunt for his friends who came after him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But on the first of April , as the law required , they had decided to open , and then adjourn court . Sheriff Haley , with two deputies and the clerk of the court , climbed the narrow stairway , opened court and as promptly adjourned . But as they were walk- ing down the road past Sweeny 's store , six heads bobbed up from behind an adobe wall , six rifles opened fire , and Sheriff Haley dropped dead . One of the deputies ran up the road , but a bullet knocked him down , while the other two jumped for cover . Every one of the first six bullets had passed through Haley 's body , for the warriors were all nursing a grudge ; but when the other deputies took cover , Red Ryan leaped over the wall . About all the pay they got in these ambushes and sudden assassinations were the guns of the men who had been killed , and Red snatched up Haley 's rifle . Another man was in the act of stripping off Haley 's pistols when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back behind the adobe wall and for an hour they shot back and forth at the164 Bloody Headclerk of the court and the deputy . Then they sneaked out the back way and that session of the court was over . At O'Grady 's store the fighting men gathered in bunches , other partisans took refuge in Sweeny 's store . Warriors sought to pay off old grudges by shooting at any enemy they recognized , and most of the shots were answered ; but , as night came on , the different parties congregated at the opposite ends of town . Mounted posses rode everywhere . They discovered each other at close range in the darkness and horses and men went down , but in the morning at daylight Red Ryan was called upon to surrender . His group of ten warriors was opposed by sixty fightingmen , mostly fighting for pay ; but , knowing what had happened to the other prisoners , he told them to turn their wolf loose . The rifles began to pop from the windows of O'Grady 's store , two buffalo-guns roared from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the middle of their shooting , lawyer Sweeny rode in with thirty-five Mexicans behind him . The Mexicanswere three to one to the Americans on both sides , and were descended from Indian-fighting stock . They carried on the battle till dark , but on the morning of the second day the fighting began in earnest . Bullets smashed through Sweeny 's wooden shutters , the sharpshooters killed another man , but with so many expert riflemen opposed to them , shootTheBattle 165ing through loopholes in the walls , lawyer Sweeny was holding them even . He might have won the day , although he was far from being a warrior , when a woman broke through the lines and ran to Fort Stanton , nine miles away . She called on Colonel Dudley to stop this day-long madness , with women and children cooped up all over town and a hand-to-hand struggle imminent . Dudley called out his men , two squadrons of Negro cavalry , and went down the road at a gallop . The bugles were sounding , two gatling guns rumbled to the front , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . It was a great triumph for the women , after the shooting of the last two days , and when the column halted in front of Sweeny 's house even O'Grady 's men came out . They mingled with the other warriors , the battle seemed to be over , but when Dudley ordered Sweeny to cease firing , saying nothing to the other side , two O'Grady men saw their chance . Slipping down into the bed of Bonito Creek with cans of coal oil in their hands , they splashed them against the shattered doors and windows and waited to hear Sweeny 's reply . " This fight was started by O'Grady , " answered the lawyer . " And as long as his men keep on shooting , my men will shoot back . " " You have heard my orders , " responded Dudley ; and marched his soldiers away . But hardly had166 Bloody HeadSweeny 's warriors resumed their places in the house than they heard the crackle of flames .

Colonel Dudley had not ordered the O'Grady men to cease shooting . Since the affair appeared to be purely a civil conflict he could respond only to the request of the authorities . Well , the sheriff was dead and all of his deputies were on O'Grady 's pay roll . So no officer requested that Dudley intervene and the firing raged all day . When the defenders of Sweeny 's house would have put the fire almost out , a savage attack from their enemies would allow it to start all over again . Room after room was abandoned until only the kitchen was left ; and then , as darkness came on , the defendersmade their break . One wall had fallen down , exposing them to the fire of the men who gathered around . Three men were shot down before Sweeny appeared , and with a volley they mowed him down . Then six defenders rushed out together through the storm of bullets , leaped over the back wall and escaped . But Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pistols , waited a moment till the firing ceased , and dashed out , shooting his way . Every warrior was shooting wildly , intent upon getting his man , but Red shot right and left , never slackening his speed , until he leaped over the wall and was gone . The Battle 167They counted their dead , then , and called for music  --  and a drink . Sweeny was dead . He had dared to oppose the Big Boss of Lincoln and the next day they laid him in his grave . CHAPTER XXITHE SHADOW OF THE BIG BOSSTHE sheriff was dead , Sweeny the lawyer was dead , and , for refusing to dance to the tune of their sixshooters , another lawyer passed out . From the expenseof meeting his pay roll Major O'Grady went broke and died bankrupt . But the gay life of the outlaws went on . With the plains covered with mavericks and unbranded calves , and huge herds passing up the trail , it was no use working for wages as long as a man had a running-iron . Martial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln was a wreck . Governor Lew Wallace was sent west by President Hayes to straighten out the tangles of hate and he proclaimed a general amnesty . Then he , the Governor , drove down from Santa Fe and appealed to the outlaw , Red Ryan . Red had lived through it all and prospered . He saw no reason to change his ways . They would kill him , anyway , if they ever took him prisoner , and his enemies were still at large . They were all at large and even the President of the United States could not make them cease fighting . Then Captain Jack Hightower , that maker of long168The Shadow of the Big Boss 169trails , came back from a trip to Wyoming , and rode into Lincoln with one man . It was Pat Garrett , an old-time buffalo hunter , just elected sheriff , and he came to bring peace  --  and a sword . Across the pommel of his saddle he still carried his old buffalo gun . It would shoot two miles , chambereda .45-90 cartridge and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were no more to shoot . The Indians still thought they had gone down a big hole , to emerge on the Judgment Day ; but , having killed his share , Pat was open to any offer , even to taking on Ryan . Red and his warriors had moved over to Three Rivers , where Butch Hardigan had a ranch and , with mavericks selling up to twenty dollars apiece , they never had far to go . When all other sources of incomefailed they could ride down and rob Henry Haught , and more than once Red had gazed upon Odette , and jerked his head and leered . There was no law of God or man that he would not break if he could , and her mother kept Odette inside the fort . It was her instinct to drive all men away if they so much as looked at Odette . With her mass of smoky hair , her trim figure and bold violet eyes , she was the belle of all that country , even as she had charmed them on the Brazos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Red Ryan was positively dangerous and only one man dared stand up to him . Not Barney Hoops , though he bristled like a dog when170 Bloody Headhe sighted his enemy in the distance ; but Ash Haught himself , ever ready for a fight . He drove them all away . Hightower rode across the desert of sand and up the steep trail to where Beau McCutcheon was wait- ing . They had had the Lincoln County war since Captain Jack had ridden away ; but when he came back from Wyoming all was changed . The Haughts had moved inside their adobe-built fort with its oak- hewn door for a gate , but at sight of the Captain the Haughts shut the door , and Hightower and Gar- rett took the hint . When they arrived at Johnson 's spring , and the stone house on the hill , Hightower found the part- ners still there . For lack of more men Rye was ready to quit , but at sight of Pat Garrett he smiled . " Our new sheriff , " announced Hightower , shak- ing hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rye . " Miles looked at Garrett , who stood six feet four in his socks , and decided that he would do . " I 've got a job for you , " he said sarcastically . " Been saving it for a man . Butch Hardigan took a shot at me last week when he found me looking over his hides . On the slaughterhouse fence  --  half of them with Texas brands on them  --  and I decided I needed some help . Because my orders from the Cap- tain were to take Red alive and  --  " " I 'll take him , " promised Garrett . " It can be done , " admitted Miles . " But at theThe Shadow of the Big Boss 171same time it 's no child 's play . Because Red Ryan and his gang make Butch 's ranch their headquarters , and I reckon you 've heard about Red . " " Mr. Garrett , " observed Hightower , " has just been elected sheriff on account of Sheriff Haley 's death , and his platform was ' Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both of you , till we get this mess straightened out . Martin Hockaday is responsible for starting all this trouble and now , when he might be of some help , he 's busy fighting some lawsuit . A lawyer has plastered his whole ranch to satisfy a judgment he 's got against him for fifty thousand dollars , but Martin swears he 'll go to jail first and they 're up in Las Vegas , fighting it out . " We ca n't depend upon Mr. Hockaday for any moral support  --  " went on Hightower , " though he did have the grace to vote for Garrett  --  and the Cattlemen'sAssociation is looking to me to bring these outlaws to book . The first man they want will be Butch Hardigan  --  we 've got the warrant all ready to serve ; and , after him  --  " " Red Ryan , " answered Garrett . " We 'll take ' em before Judge Bristol , over at Las Cruces ; and Beau , I suppose you 'll be on the jury . Be sure you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded McCutcheon , meekly . " Of course , " went on the Captain , " I know you'drather get in on this fighting ; but it is very important to keep that jury lined up . I blame Martin Hocka-172 Bloody Headday more than anyone else for starting this Lincoln County War . He 's made a joke of all this stealing and rustling until a jury would hardly convict . But this recent big killing has rather sobered them down , and perhaps they 'll listen to me , now . This rustling must stop , and the way to stop it is  --  " " Kill every son-of-a-goat that packs an iron , " nodded Garrett . " Well  --  maybe , " assented Hightower . " I 've got to be going now and you can use your own discretion . How 's the cattle business progressing , Mr. McCutcheon ? I 've brought you a pair of glasses that may come in handy in watching that outlaw trail . It leads right down past Haught 's fort , and I can see Haught has been losing cows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up this gang , but he 's bitter against us all . If you want to sell some steers , arrange it with Sheriff Duran . I ca n't afford to appearin this sale at all or some one will claim I 'm a cow-thief . " He broiled a strip of beef , gnashed it savagely in front of the fire and rode off down the trail with a sigh . It was a matter of regret with him that he had refused to buy Haught 's steers , for it turned out he was an honest man ; but twice before he had wanted to cut Hightower 's herd , and that was something he would not stand . Hightower had even refused to buy steers from Hockaday when he found out that the herd was stolen , but he still regarded him asThe Shadow of the Big Boss 173a friend , led astray by the spirit of the times . Everybodywas stealing , it was the custom of the country ; but this rustling would have to stop . Otherwise they would go out of business . CHAPTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , bringing herd after herd from the Brazos , and the cattlemen at home had elected him President , though he was off on the trail half the time . But making money hand over fist , and carrying on the campaign to boot . In a land where an honest cowmanwas the noblest work of God , he had stood out for honesty to the end . It had cost him lots of money , but he did not regret it . And it showed that honesty paid . While the poor white trash and nesters were stealinga few cows he was selling a thousand , every one marked with his road-brand , and coming back for more . But until he came upon Pat Garrett he thought Red Ryan had won . Pat and Red had worked side by side in the old days and regarded each other as friends . Each man was a killer , as cold as a stone , but the cards said Garrett would win . He had the law behind him , had lived a hard life , and in every way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's platform had been he promised to kill him first . " Well , boys , " observed Garrett , as Hightower rode away , " you 've been having it pretty soft , I can see174The Scalp Hunter 175that . Branding up these mavericks , putting in windowsand doors , rocking up your spring and all that . But if you 're going to ride with me  --  " " I 'll ride with you , " answered Miles , defiantly . " We will start an hour before dawn , " said Pat , and curled up before the fireplace like a dog . His legs were so long they almost touched the ground when he stepped up on his black mule , and he had had to make leggings out of buffalo-hide to reach the tops of his boots . There was something wry and cynical about his twisted smile and he went after Red like a wolfer when the cattlemen offered a big reward . He would have to kill Ryan in order to get his scalp , but killing was his business . As if awakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn . There was frost in the air , but he did not wear a coat . Just a fringed buckskin shirt with half the strings gone where he had cut them off for whangs . He set off without looking back or even waiting for breakfast and when he saw Miles behind him he seemed genuinely surprised . But he did not say a word until he came to where the trail split . " Know anything about this country ? " he asked , and Rye Miles grunted assent . " Been all over it , " he said . " What 's the best way to get to that slaughterhouse ? " inquired Pat , and Rye jerked his head to the left . With his saddle-gun under his knee and two pis-176 Bloody Headtols in his belt he watched the ridges like a hawk , but Garrett still clung to his old Sharp 's rifle , balanced across the horn of his saddle . By simply pointing it from where it lay and pulling the trigger he could beat any man shooting at close range ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the buffalos-he figured on a bull for every cartridge . The sun was just up when they reached the post slaughterhouse and hid out to watch for Hardigan . He rode in , just as horse-faced as ever , driving a small band of cattle before him , and Garrett moved the muzzle of his gun . Hardigan saw it and reached for his pistol , but when he saw the twisted smile behind the gun he stopped and held up his hands . " Unbuckle your belt , " said Garrett , " and put your guns on the ground . This is Mr. Hardigan , I be-lieve ? " " Hardigan ! ' " repeated the butcher , unbuckling his gun-belt but neglecting to put it down . " Oh , you mean the butcher ? He 'll be along in a minute  --  with some of the byes , you know . I 'm just the hired man that does the butchering . " " Ye-es ! " mocked Rye Miles , rising up from behind a rock ; and Hardigan hesitated  --  for a second . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him anxiously . " The byes will be along anny minute , " he observed , speaking to Garrett . " You 're familiar with them all , of carse . There 's Red Ryan and Charley Bowdre , Tom O'Phaillard and all the rest of them  --  " The Scalp Hunter 177 " Then I 'll wait , " said Pat Garrett , and laughed . " Are those your steers , Mr. Hardigan ? " " These ? Mine ? " Butch 's red are ! " answered Miles , " and I 'll take my oath I saw Hardigan hang them on the fence . This is the same man that took a shot at me , Mr. Garrett , when he caught me reading the brands . " " Oh , is this Misther Garrett , our new sheriff ? " exclaimed Hardigan with a winning smile ; but Garrettpicked up Hardigan 's pistols without even answering him and beckoned him down the trail . Judge Bristol was waiting in the courtroom at Mesilla for the prisoner to be brought in and , after Miles had identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked up . Then , as the wheels of justice began to turn , he sentenced him to two years . Just to get him out of the way . Beau McCutcheon was on the jury , with eleven other good men and true and while they were going through the routine of sending Butch to prison , Pat Garrett headed back to Butch 's ranch . But Red Ryan was gone , and tall Tom Pickett , Charley Bowdre and all the rest . They had left in a day and there was snow on the ground before they were even heard of . They rode into White Oaks to get a drink and , on the way out , Red shot at a deputy sheriff in what178 Bloody Headhe considered a friendly way . But a posse of officers rode after them , they were surprised at Coyote Springs and Ryan was lucky to escape on foot , after having his horse shot out from under him . White Oaks was an old , deserted mining camp , where the outlaws had spent thousands of dollars for the drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more they dropped from sight . They were doing a big business in stealing Texas cattle and selling them in southern New Mexico , picking up as many more on the way back and driving them to northern Texas . But Texas was the loser at both ends of the line and Garrett spread his nets for Red . The country was large , most of the Mexicans were his friends and they kept him fully informed ; but the news got out that Ryan was coming to Fort Sumner to celebrate Christmas Eve . There was dancing and drinking and Tom and Jerry , but someone had told Garrett the way they would go out and he rode in with fifteen men . Fightingmen , too ; but not outlaws , not cow-thieves . They were gunmen , killers , but they fought within the law , though as yet with very little principle . It was just that the war had roused men at last to the danger of all this stealing . Hundreds of thousands of settlers were moving into the West , but they all went by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The country had got a bad name and half the stores in Lincoln were deserted . But Pat Garrett was still trying to fulfillThe Scalp Hunter 179his election promise and get Red Ryan or bust . He entered Fort Sumner after dark and took refuge in the old military hospital . It was vacant and abandonednow  --  all the better for Pat  --  and while scouts watched the road the posse played poker by the fire . Midnight came , with its yelling and shooting ; and then , out from town , five horsemen came at a gallop . No one knew who they were , but Red Ryan was in town so the posse stepped out into the moonlight , Pat Garrett with his big buffalo-gun . " Throw up your hands , " he said on general principles ; but still the outlaws came on . A man out in front reached down for his six-shooter , the buffalo-gunwent off and shot him above the heart . The rest stopped short , realized that they had run into an ambush , whirled around and clattered away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right-hand man , and watched him die in agony . But Red Ryan was not there . CHAPTER XXIIISTINKING SPRINGSSTILL the wolf pack was getting closer , Garrett had got his first man and driven Ryan pell-mell into the hills . A rancher came in and reported him headingnorth , towards an old , abandoned house called Stinking Springs . There was a blizzard blowing , the ground was covered with snow which had coveredup the tracks , but at midnight Pat Garrett set out again , to kill Red Ryan or die . At daylight , with three picked men , he crept up behind the cutbank of the wash and looked over the top at the door , not thirty feet away . They were there , for two horses were standing outside waiting hopelessly for their riders to awake , and Garrett hid his horses out of range . Then he settled down in the whirling storm and at last a man came out . It was Charlie Bowdre , bringing out a morral of corn for his horse , and the old buffalo-gun came up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Bowdre reached for his gun . Bang ! went the rifle and Bowdre staggered . Bang Bang ! And he almost went down . But he turned and stumbled back through the doorway , and they could hear every word that was said. 18oStinking Springs 181 " They 've got you , Charlie , " said Ryan . " Plumb through the chest  --  you ca n't live . See if you can get one of them before you die ! " He shoved him out into the stillness and Garrett let him come on . It was only thirty feet and Bowdre had nearly got to the ditch before he pitched forward and died . " Come out of that , you fellows ! " ordered Garrett ; but Ryan was not a man to quit . He was safe , behind the stone walls , and he had his horse inside , a racing mare he was fond of . But these were different men from the ones he had encountered when he was shooting up the town at Lincoln . With rifle bullets they cut the ropes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Better come out , " advised Pat ; but he could hear them trying to dig loopholes through the walls . So he let them dig on in the cold . " What 's the use ? " inquired a voice at last . " He 's killed two men and he 'll kill all the rest of us . We might as well give up . " " Not me ! " cursed Ryan and the besiegers lit a fire to boil a pot of coffee . Down out of the wind they had coffee and bacon and eggs , while the outlaws were hungry and cold . It was more than human nature could stand and , as sundown approached they showed a white handkerchief on a stick . " We 'll come out , " said Ryan , " before we freeze to death , if you 'll promise not to shoot . That coffee smell is too much for us. " 182 Bloody Head " Hands up ! " commanded Garrett , and Red Ryan came out first . He crawled out humbly , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last chance to escape ; and the posse put the handcuffs on every one of them before they gave them a drink . Then they mounted them on the slowest horses they had and tied their feet together under the ponies ' bellies . It was a long way to Mesilla , the old courthouse near Las Cruces where Judge Bristol awaited their coming , and there they were put in leg-irons . Garrettwas taking no chances with these men he knew were just waiting to kill him . Bristol had refused , once before , to hold court in Lincoln ; but this was in Dona Ana County , where Manuel Duran de Chaves held forth . The wheels of justice were grinding slowly , but they would grind exceedingly fine . There was something in the look of this grim man on the bench which warned Ryan he could expect no mercy . Duran was still the same old Manuel  --  courteous , kindly , efficient  --  but Beau knew he had not wholly forgotten when Red Ryan had been there before . Then he had jumped the Comanches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they could escape . Then returned to the river , rounded up every steer with a Texas brand on it and driven them all away . It had been a great loss to the Mexicanpopulation , especially to the comancheros , butStinking Springs 183Duran had shaken his head when they begged him to interfere . They had let Hockaday take the steers and , inside of a week , every animal had been stolen again . By this same Ryan who now stood before the judge and answered him with downcast eyes . He had been the spear and front of the Texas invasionwhich , crossing the barren Staked Plains , had brought the first steers to Horsehead Crossing and driven them up the Pecos . They had fought off the Apaches and Comanches , riding roughshod over the Mexicans , even robbing the man for whom they worked ; and at the end of it all Red stood at the bar of justice , charged with murder and with no one to defend him . " Have you a lawyer ? " inquired the judge , and Ryan shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold them to beef buyers and butchers , but no man would defendhim now . " Have you no money to engage an attorney ? " asked the judge , and once more Ryan hung his head . While he had been riding in the lead of his gang , giving mavericks to ranchers , feeding the Mexicans with yearlings , he had been the outlaw king of New Mexico . But , with all the easy money that went through his hands he had never saved a dime . " Then if you wish , " went on the judge , imperturbably , " I will appoint a man to defend you . " It had come to that , then . He had had to take the pauper 's oath and the prosecuting attorney sat184 Bloody Headsmiling . Someone had killed the previous prosecuting attorney when he was going to open court , but here was another one smiling . They had killed all the lawyers in Lincoln  --  and killed the sheriff , too . But after the shooting was all over , Red Ryan stood before the bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood guard to prevent his escape ; and , conveniently near , Pat Garrett , his old friend , with his terrifying buffalo-gun . Pat had been elected with the slogan : " Get Red Ryan . " And , while he was getting Red , he had picked up three other men who had defied the law for years . Yet Garrett had got them all , and in the jury box sat another man Red knew . Beau McCutcheon , who had put his back against the heavy timbers at Fort Davis and let him out of the snakehole ; Bloody Head , who had led the battle against the Comanches , yet refused to cut another man 's herd . He sat impassively when man after man testified that he , Ryan , had murdered Sheriff Haley . Shot him in the back from behind and robbed him of his fine rifle . After that the appeals of the attorney for the defensesounded rather weak and inane . The jury retired and cast but one vote before the bailiff brought them in . The clerk of the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defendant was guilty of murder and they fixed his punishment at death . It was then that , for the first time , Red sensedStinking Springs 185the giant conspiracy to railroad him to certain death ; but he stood up boldly while the judge passed sentence  --  the same judge he had promised to kill . On the thirteenth of May he would be hanged by the neck until he was dead , dead , dead . Well , that was what he had expected ; but when two death guards took him back to his cell it came as an unpleasant surprise . Both were personal enemies of his , and they put the handcuffs on very tight . Then they clamped the shackles on his legs and fitted them  --  a little tight . " Aha ! " said Bob 011inger , the deputy United States Marshal whose partner Ryan had killed . " You 'll get what 's coming to you now . My old friend Bob Beckwith will be waiting to see you when you step off and go to hell . " He was a rough-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a plainsman . Three notches were cut on the handle of his six-shooter and his eyes were of the pale steel-blue that is supposed to be the mark of a killer . It was for just this reason that Garrett had appointed him head of the death watch . 011inger hated Red and was forever seeking to tempt him to escape , so he could shoot him in the back . The other guard was different , though with just as good reason for killing Ryan , if he could . For , not two months before , Red had slain Deputy Sheriff Carlyle , when he was making a dash to escape . With any reason at all , Bell would have put a bullet through him ; but as 011inger rode Ryan day and186 Bloody Headnight , his partner on the death watch soon got tired of it . " Leave the kid alone , " he said to 011inger . " Within a month he 'll be dead , and that 's good enough for me . He murdered Jim Carlyle and I 'd shoot him for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leaves us alone , do n't bother him all the time . " They loaded him into a hack and took him over the mountains to the place where he was sentenced to die , but the jail at Lincoln would hardly hold a drunk and Garrett moved him into the courtroom . It was a large airy place on the second floor of O'Grady 's old store , well away from any chance to rescue him and at the same time absolutely safe . With the handcuffs on his wrists day and night and a heavy pair of leg-irons on his ankles , he was as safe as he could be kept . There was n't a real prison in New Mexico . The arrest of this one man and his sentence to death had broken up his whole gang . There was no one who dared come to his rescue , though Red Ryan might have done it for them . But the fear of Pat Garrett had cast a shadow over the whole community and Pat was determined that Ryan should hang . Every night for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same room and watched him close ; but the time came at last when he had to go to White Oaks to order the timbers for the scaffold . No one had been hanged in Lincoln County inStinking Springs 187the regular , accepted way . They might have been strung up to a tree somewhere or suspended from the end of a wagon-tongue , but Garrett felt the need of a gallows to carry out the order of the court . Three weeks before the fatal Friday , the thirteenth , he rode down to White Oaks to make the final arrangements , and before he went he climbed the crooked stairs to see that his prisoner was safe . Red Ryan was sitting across the table from Bell , who was playing him Mexican monte . " Well , boys , " said Pat , " got to go out of town on a little official business . Good morning , Red  --  is he perfectly safe ? " " If it 's that gallows you 're thinking about , " spoke up 011inger , " you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours until I can see Red Ryan , dancing a jig on thin air . It 's just three weeks until I spring the trap and  --  " " He 's perfectly safe , " stated Bell . " Handcuffs and shackles all right ? " " They 're fitted so tight he 's worked all the skin off and  --  " " Maybe he 's trying to get loose in the night ? " " It ca n't be done , " laughed Red . " Or I 'd 've skipped out , long ago . No . Go ahead and get your scaffold built and let 's have it over with before 011inger talks himself to death . All he thinks about , day and night , is how pretty I 'll look when I 'm dancing a jig in hell . " " Well , I 'm sorry for you , Red , " said Garrett , " but1 88 Bloody Headit 's got to be done . And Bell and Bob , I 'm dependingon you not to go to sleep at the switch . Watch him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and look out he do n't grab your guns . I 'm depending on you , now . So long . " He nodded his head at Red and beckoned 011inger down the hall-way that led to the flight of steps . " Everything all right ? " he asked . " No ! " answered 011inger . " Bell is reading him the paper , and first thing we know Red will grab him . He 's a slick little feller , always up to some trick  --  " " Stick around , then , " advised Garrett . " Red has got to do something , to keep his mind off of being hung . Let Bell read the paper and play monte with him , but keep your eagle eye out till I get back . " " Do n't worry , Pat , " said 011inger , " we 'll watch him like a goat . How 's this for keeping him scared up ? " He stepped to a closet where their guns were kept and came out with a double-barreled shotgun . " See this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen buckshot in each barrel , and I reckon a man who gets them will feel it . " " Yes , " smiled Ryan . " You may get one yourself . " And he went on playing cards . CHAPTER XXIV . THE ESCAPETHAT was the way Red took it , with a joke and a smile , but he was fighting the handcuffs all night . He was starving himself , and they thought he had lost his appetite , with the hanging only a few days off . But , right when Garrett was gone and there was a chance to make a break , Charlie Wall killed four Mexicans at Tularosa and came to Lincoln to escape being mobbed . The scene of the killing was in Dona Ana County , and he was afraid of Manuel Duran ; but Pat Garrett was an old friend of his and Pat let him stay in the courtroom . Stay and wear his pistols and sleep there at night , and he had four Mexicans with him who were around under foot , day and night . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone  --  with Bell . About five o'clock that evening Bob 011inger took Charlie Wall and the four armed prisoners to the hotel across the street for supper , and at last Red Ryan was alone . Bell sat in a chair several paces away , reading the newspaper , as was his custom , although011inger had warned him against it . Because1891 90 Bloody Heada man with his eyes on the paper could not watch as active a prisoner as Ryan . The time had come , but Red did not hurry . He had learned to slip his left hand free , no matter how tightly they clamped it and , timing his leap until Bell raised the paper up , he made a spring , striking him over the head with the steel cuff . Bell threw up both hands to protect his head and Red got what he was after . The Gun . He grabbed it out of its scabbard and shot Bell with his own pistol as he ran . Bell got to the head of the stairway before he tumbled and fell dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting at the foot of the stairs . Of course Geiss stampeded , rushing out the gate towards the hotel and 011inger came on the run . " Bell has killed Red , " Geiss shouted , and 011inger slackened his pace to a walk . This was what he had expected  --  Bell had only beaten him to it  --  and there was no hurry whatever , now . But as he walked across the street Red stuck his head out the window , with Bob 's shotgun in his hand . Feeling the body of Bell fall upon him Geiss had thought it was Red . But , instead of being killed , Red had smashed in the door of the closet where all their arms were kept and snatched out 011inger 's gun . " Hello , Bob ! " he called in honeyed tones ; and put eighteen buckshot through his heart . That was what Bob had promised him . After that Red hobbled back to the armory , The Escape 191buckled two belts of cartridges around his waist , and two Colt 's pistols . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked in his shackles to pick up the shotgun , and stepped out on the front porch . " Take that , " he said , emptying the shotgun into 011inger 's body and all the people in the hotel rushed out . But not to kill Red , not for shooting the deputy United States Marshal . Charlie Wall and his Mexicanswere all armed , but they wanted to see Red get away . He had to procure a file before he could cut himself loose from the leg-irons , but he still had time to dance a jig before he mounted and rode away . The black pony he clambered up on , encumbered with his guns and ammunition , put his head down and bucked him off , but he handed his rifle to the jailer to hold  --  and the jailer gave it back . Then Ryan galloped off to the west , looking back and giving three cheers . When Garrett heard the news on the streets of White Oaks he hired every man in the county who would fight to cut off Red at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's where he 'll go , and the Mexicans will make him their king . I knowed all the time that scaffold would be my Jonah . We ai n't educated up to it yet . " Pat Garrett was chagrined at the way the courts of law had marred his plans to get Red . In a country without a decent jail in it the Judge had set the day for the hanging almost two months ahead and , before the scaffold could be laboriously constructed , Red192 Bloody HeadRyan was far away . On the way out of town he stopped at a Mexican ranch and filled up with coffee and beans . Then he went to another ranch where the man was a blacksmith and got him to strike off his irons . After that he disappeared and , while Garrett raked New Mexico for him , he kept out of sight for months . Captain Hightower had stock detectives all over the country , collecting the cattle stolen from his ranches and driving them back to the home range , but he turned them all loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their orders were different . After this last failure of the law , the formality of a hanging would be dispensed with . If they ever came within range of this prince of outlaws he would be shot on sight , and no questions asked . But now Red Ryan was gone . He was gone , but not forgotten , and soon the Mexicansbegan to sing songs about him and the good deeds he had done . Robbing the rich to feed the pc or . Always the friend of the Mexicans . But while Captain Hightower was searching for Ryan he found Martin Hockaday  --  in jail . He had been there for months , while all the fighting was going on , and his vast empire had fallen in ruins . A lawyer had taken over the old claims against him and , when he resolutely refused to pay them , had thrown him into the Las Vegas jail . But , having been robbed once , Hockaday had lost all faith in lawyers . A good attorney could have had him released in twentyTheEscape 193four hours ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oath that , while they might collect from his heirs , they would never collect from him . It is the law in New Mexico , passed down from old Spanish days , that a man can be imprisoned for debt . Another lawyer raked up other claims , he piled Pelion on Ossa in order to break Hockaday 's proud spirit ; and so , while his cattle were being stolen by the thousand , Martin Hockaday lay in jail . His Salamander safe had been stuffed to the doors with quit-claim deeds for land ; millions of acres on both sides of the Pecos , giving him absolute control of the water . And when the man whom he had trusted to handle his affairs took advantage of his absence to abscond , even then he would not pay . And meanwhile some sixty thousand head of cattle were running wild on the open plains . Captain Hightower came riding in at last from his great ranch in the Panhandle of Texas . He had sent out fifteen of the best stock detectives in the country , but things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had always sworn by , had turned out a dismal failureand Garrett was ready to resign . There was no law to be enforced as long as the jails would not hold ; and , with Red Ryan still loose , even across the Rio Grande in Mexico , that one man could thwart them all . He was a devil in human form  --  a gay , laughing devil  --  and now he could not be found . Some said ' 94 Bloody Headhe was hiding so close that he could hear every word they said . He still drank at the bars in half the saloons in New Mexico , and yet Pat Garrett could not find him . Garrett sent two good men across the border into Old Mexico and they came back without seeing a sign . No , he was not there , this man they had once taken and let slip through their hands . And all on account of the law 's delays when a six-shooter would have done just as well as a scaffold . Captain Hightowersaw them all , even Beau McCutcheon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Red was there . He was there somewhere , and the Mexicans knew it . But they laughed , they shrugged their shoulders , they would not tell . Twenty stock detectives were in hiding , besides the fifteen at work , the cattle were being driven off  --  two ways . And could no man find out what any kid might tell him ; or any sweetheart , if she would ? Well , it was there before their eyes if they would only look around ; and the next time Red Ryan came under their guns  --  or were the Mexicans too smart for them ? He departed , still muttering in his beard , and it was left to Manuel Duran de Chaves to find out what everybody knew . CHAPTER XXVENOUGHDON MANUEL had seen many people come and go since he had settled down on the Rio Grande . Apaches , Navajos , Comanches , Utes ; and Mexicans and Texans , too . They all had their ways and Duran had learned to know them , for on the river his word was law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from Las Cruces and Mesilla ; and in fifteen years he had not killed a man , so well was he respected and feared . Even the Texans feared him , though he was always so polite ; but there was one man among them he could trust . The red-headed little Beau who lived at Johnson 's Canyon and always fed the Indians when they passed . Or anybody else  --  he knew when people were hungry and always had a beef hung up . Duran knew he could trust him not to tell all he heard , and this Ryan was getting rough . The women were afraid of him  --  and the men-folks , too  --  but Bloody Head was alwayspolite . Even with the pelado Mexicans . And he had a girl , himself . Such a pretty little girl  --  he watched her through his glasses and smiled when she went out to ride195196 Bloody Headbut he never went down to call . The Haught men had warned him off  --  the best boy of them all  --  and he did not wish to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle , quick to take offense , treating their Mexican servants like slaves ; but if Seraphin Ortega , the adobe-maker , was sure Beau could be trusted he would tell him something , maybe . The Haughts were still making bricks , still buildingup the walls of their fort , still keeping their women inside ; but there was something Seraphin knew . He had built his own house away from the rest , but his women were afraid of one man . Red rode down at night from Three Rivers Canyon , to see a woman who was there . Not Seraphin 's daughter  --  hekept her too close  --  but there is always such a woman . And such a man . He came at night , when the Haughts had gone to bed , but the women all knew who he was . The same man the Texans were hunting for , though they did not guess he was there . He came and went boldly , and he paid his woman in gold from some cache that he had in the hills , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had tried to steal once before when she had slapped him in the face and run . Her brother , the next day , had tried to whip this man and Colorado had rapped him over the head . Yes , it was the same man  --  Red  --  but how to put the Texans on his trail ! Duran visited them often  --  they were all Las Cruces Mexicans  --  and at last one man told him theEnough ' 197news . It was no secret among the women ; but Seraphin , the adobe-maker , knew . With a reward on his head , with forty men hunting for him , Red had come back to his hiding-place at Three Rivers , just over the hills from Lincoln . Seraphin knew , for he had a dog that growled and a daughter that needed to be watched . Red came by the door one night and Seraphin looked out and saw him try the Haught gate . But it was the women who found out what he sought . It was Odette . The fine , tall woman with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest . The one who rode out boldly , with only her brother , Ash , and he a man easily killed . Red had asked his querida if she could not lure Ash away , and she had guessed the rest . Red was going south , to the land of manana , where a man need not of necessity get married , and he wanted this woman to take with him . She hated him now , and feared him , but he had set his heart on Odette . There were other men , of course , who wanted to marry her and would give a horse for her smile . They were big , they were strong ; but the Ranger Miles had taken her fancy , though Barney Hoops had warned him away . But when she saw him riding by she showed herself in the gateway , and the women could guess the rest . Much more they guessed , while they were washing their clothes and grinding tortillas by the fire ; but they did not think it necessary to tell their husbands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bloody Headone man among them who knew what was going on , since he had a young daughter who needed watching and who had caught Red 's roving eye . Red dropped in in passing , to visit with her father and inquire about the making of the walls ; and once he had asked idly about the Mescalero Apaches and how , by sawing with a rough rawhide reata , they could cut through the adobes like paper . Idle talk , of course , but at the end of the evening , he had asked where Odette lived . Odette and all the others , but Seraphin was not born yesterday . He had served as a soldier with Manuel Duran de Chaves and had the courage to tell all he knew . Not the first time either and , after thanking him for his confidence and finding out just how the ground lay , Duran had given him the rest of the bottle . Here was something which Don Manuel had suspected , for he was the patron of all that country and esteemed it to be his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had got Seraphin Ortega the job to move out with his gente and build this fort for the Haughts ; and , while they were working , they made houses for themselves , down on the edge of the wash . The men made the bricks , mixing the mud day by day and laying the adobes out to dry , and Colonel Haught had been well pleased with the result . His fort had been made quickly , to keep out evil men , and in the end they had built the gateway , exactly like the one at Cebolleta , which their fathers had built before them . Enough 199Those walls had been made of stone , four feet wide and ten feet high , with every room on the inside , where they could stand on the roof and fight over the top . They were built continuously , of plain adobe bricks , and the entrance was closed by a narrow gate , formed of planks two feet thick which were fastened by a heavy iron bar . Five thousand Navajoshad hurled themselves against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built a fort just like it . But when this Red Ryan planned to saw his way through and steal the Senora 's daughter , that was something that called for action . Duran had engaged the men to build the fort and the Colonel had paid him promptly . He was a hard man and a stern one but he did not steal their cattle , like the Texans from over on the Pecos . Nor did his men fight among themselves all the time , like the warriors of Lincoln . They were a clan , like the gentes of the Mexicans , who honored the word of their patron , and if Red had his way their fort would lay in ruins , like the buildings in old Lincoln . And Garrett had married a woman of Las Cruces , so in a way he was a Mexican himself . Not a straight Texan , like Haught , with his overbearing ways , treating his workmen like dogs . But still he was honest . He paid . So with many things to consider for the safety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must find a Texan he could trust  --  and who else but Beau McCutcheon ? He was kind , he was honest , 20o Bloody Headand he fed the Indians beef . That showed his heart was good . Two days later , when his trip to Three Rivers would be forgotten , Duran rode up the old Jornada de Muerto , where a traveler had gone so long withouteating or drinking that he looked like a shrunken dead man . " Good morning , Don Beau , " greeted Buran . " How is your health , my friend ? I was wondering where I could get some more steers , in place of those which were stolen by the Comanches , first , and then sold to the comancheros , and then stolen back by Don Martin Hockaday . Then stolen all over again by your friend Red Ryan  --  " " He is no friend of mine , " broke in Beau . " No ? " said Duran . " Then perhaps we can talk business ; after I have bought , perhaps , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing around the water-hole and feeding out on the plains . I can give you ten dollars a head , or maybe fifteen , or twenty . " " You can have all you want for ten , " smiled Beau , " and I will help you drive them home . Then some more wild cattle will come down from the mountains and I will have as many more . I have not forgotten , Don Manuel , that it was you who guided me to this spot . " " I made a good neighbor , and a good friend , " repliedDuran . " But you are right . Some others will come . So we will round up these mavericks and takeEnough 20 ithem to Las Cruces . And on the way , when no one can overhear us , I will speak of something else . I wonder if you have noticed , my friend , that your camp is being watched  --  from that hill . " " Yes indeed , " laughed McCutcheon . " He is a fugitive from justice who is hiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a little beef and he hides on that hill when he sees the sheriff coming in . " " To be sure , " agreed Duran . " And a man must eat . But this man , as I know , is no friend of yours . He searches your house when you are gone . " " I have seen his tracks , " answered Beau soberly . " But never have I seen his face . He wears moccasins , but he is not an Apache . " " He is a spy , " exclaimed Duran , hotly . " Sent from Haught 's fort to watch your every move . Perhapshe is waiting to kill you . " " No , " replied McCutcheon . " But you know the Haught outfit  --  they think every man is a thief . I reckon he is watching , to catch me killing a calf , and then he will have me arrested . " " If you placed a bullet near him , " suggested Manuel , " he would go away and not come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hills when they see me , and you of course know best . Even the ravens know your camp and fly down to get meat , but ravens can be your friends . When they see a man coming they fly down and croak . That may keep you from being killed . " " It is part of my job , " said Beau , " to stay here202 Bloody Headand see who goes by . I am paid one hundred dollars by my friend , Captain Hightower , to report to him , every month . " " There is a man I did not like at first , " confessed Duran , as they rode along the trail . " But since he has brought in these stock detectives and ordered them to respect every brand , I have had to change my mind . But what of this new sheriff he has got elected ? Do you like Pat Garrett ? Do you trust him ? " " He is working for my patron , " said McCutcheon , " and that is enough for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Mexicans are all laughing at him , because his prisoner escaped , but Red Ryan is a desperate man . Would you , who are so brave , dare to meet him ? But no , I do not say that . Have you one or two friends you can trust , to kill , if necessary , this man ? " " I have , " replied Beau , " if I get what you mean . We Texans stand together . " " Then go to the fort of Colonel Haught , " said Duran . " Go with your gun in your hand , and take your two Texas friends . I do not like these Texans , if the truth must be told , but even they have their use . Now listen to what I say . A man is to be killed , and you Texans can do it , but no one must ever know . I pass the word to you , and you tell your friends ; but me , I know nothing about it . " You know my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet there is one secret  --  the greatest of all  --  which the Texans can never guess , though halfEnough 203the Mexicans know . Red Ryan has come back to Three Rivers Canyon , he is hiding in the mountains , and all the Mexican women know . He comes down at night , when the dogs have ceased barking , and goes to one woman , outside the fort . She lives in the last house , on the edge of the wash . I hope you can get him there . But if all our plans fail go to the first house in the row and inquire for Seraphin . Enough . Have I talked too much ? " " Not with me , " answered Beau . " I am your friend . " " Then do not go near the place for one week . And carry your gun in your hand . " CHAPTER XXVITWO FRIENDSA WEEK was not too much to find Garrett and Miles , and even then Pat would not believe . " Here ? " he scoffed . " Right over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head ? Red Ryan is in Mexico and I know it . But all right , I 'll try anything . The Mexicans all know something , I see that . " " He comes in late , " went on McCutcheon . " When the dogs have settled down for the night . In the last house  --  down the gulch  --  and if I 'd tell you the rest you 'd believe me . He 's got his eye on a woman . " " What woman ? " demanded Miles , standing up . " Never mind , " answered Beau . " Just be there . " " I 've been hearing the same thing for a month , " grumbled Garrett , " but we might meet him in the road . Or going out . " " Or we might meet him coming in , " said Rye . " Come on . What are we waiting for ? Right now ! " " Now it is ! " repeated Garrett , despondently . " If we get him at all it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds and turn back . " They rode in early , tying their horses up the gulch204Two Friends 205and carrying their boots as they walked down to the last house , but the place was silent as the grave . They stood in complete darkness , looking up over the cut bank , listening to the noises of the night . There was a light in the next house , a smell of bacon frying , and then a man came out . " That 's him ! " whispered Garrett . " Look out ! " They stood there waiting ; dark figures came and went , and then all was silent again . " He got away from us , " mumbled Pat . " But I 'd know that stoop anywhere . Come on , let 's go up to the house . " He led the way then up a plank walk , newly mad ; with cottonwood trees set in regular rows , and as the door swung open and Seraphin peeped out Garrett motioned his friends to wait . There was a murmur of Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on the edge . Then the sound of footsteps as some one came running , barefoot , along the planks . Some Mexican kid , they thought . A feeling of apathy had come over them , after their long hours of waiting in the dark , and they did not even get up . Miles had got his spur caught beneath the plank walk and it rattled as he jerked it loose . " Quien es ? " asked a voice . " Who is it ? " " Do n't be scared , " responded Beau , out of the darkness ; and the Mexican started back and drew his pistol . " Who is it ? " he demanded again . " No ley asi  --  it makes no difference , " replied Miles , 206 Bloody Headseeing a butcher knife in his hand . " Go ahead and get your meat . " It hung there against the side of the house , what was left of a shoulder of beef , and the boy reached up to cut a slice . Then he leaped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Who is it ? What do you want ? " Again the old apathy , coming from nerves let down , settled over them and they did no reply . What was it to them if the Mexican got his meat ? Or was scared when he discovered two men ? In the dark Red Ryan looked meager and small and his back had a decided stoop , like a boy who had worked too hard . For a moment he stood with his pistol drawn , pointingstraight at McCutcheon 's breast . Then he backed in the open door , still carrying his butcher knife , and at the sound of his voice Beau jumped up . " Who are they ? " it asked , and in the black darknessGarrett recognized his man . But in sitting down on the edge of the bed he had caught his long holster under him , and he did not dare to move . Red stood so close he could reach out and touch him . He knew his voice when he spoke to Beau . But inside the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the bed . " That 's him , " whispered Ortega . And Pat Garrettgrabbed for his gun . " Who 's that ? " cried Ryan , backing up , and for the first time he stepped into the moonlight . Garrett raised his pistol and shot twice , plungingTwo Friends 207out as he did so and stooping low . Behind him came Seraphin Ortega , scared as if he had seen a ghost . They stood there , guns in hand , not daring to speak , hardly knowing what was going on . Then , from inside , they heard the gurgle of blood and Garrett put up his gun . " I got him , boys , " he said . " That was Red . " CHAPTER XXVIICOLONEL HAUGHT AGAINEVEN in death they were frightened of this man whom they had taken for a Mexican kid . They lit a candle at last and thrust it in through the window and there lay Red Ryan , dead . He had been shot through the heart , and lay sprawling , his gun still grasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they set up a wail and Garrett drew his men outside . " Out of here , " he ordered , as the women began to weep ; and they rode back to camp the same night . Other men galloped by them , they were spreading the news everywhere like the warnings of an Indian uprising . At last it was out . Ryan had come to his death by the hand of Pat Garrett , who had set out to get him from the first . Pat had been the only man to know what was going on when he heard Red 's voice outside . And even in the dark he shot straight . They rode home in silence , looking back across the White Sands to where at dawn they saw people swarming in . From Ruidoso , from Lincoln , from Tularosa , from every place where the word had spread , and at last Pat Garrett spoke up. 208Colonel Haught Again 209 " Well , boys , " he said , " here 's how it happened . We were looking for someone else and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red walked in on us  --  he was hiding all the time  --  and came down to get a chunk of meat . Nobody told us . It was all an accident . Is n't that right , Mr. McCutcheon ? Becauseeverybody will want to know . " " That 's right , " agreed Beau , and Miles grunted assent . That was their story and they stuck to it for three days  --  until Captain Hightower came . He rode in down Three Rivers Canyon with eight stock detectivesbehind him , and they would have gone past without stopping if Colonel Haught had not come out of his fort . Many people had rushed in , asking insistent questions which he was unable to answer ; and when he saw this man , the head and front of the whole movement , riding by without breaking his pace he stepped up on his horse and rode after him . " Captain Hightower , sir ! " he shouted , as his whole clan galloped out after him ; and Hightower reined in his horse . " Yes , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , Colonel H aught . And before you say another word I want to state that in no way do I hold this against you . Red Ryan is dead  --  and he died at Three Rivers  --  but you yourself I hold blameless . " " Blameless of what ? " stormed Haught . " I hope , sir , that never for a moment did you think I was connected with his gang . " 210 Bloody Head " Certainly not ! " returned Hightowner , beginning to blink , " and I am glad at this time to say so . But there have been moments in the past  --  " " When you treated me like a thief  --  and no gen-tleman ! " " Perhaps so , " answered the Captain . " And if so , I apologize . We all make mistakes  --  " " Mistakes ! " yelled Haught . " When you rode by without stopping ! Is that the way of a gentleman ? " " Perhaps not , " admitted the Captain , turning red and beginning to shout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides talking over old mistakes . So if you will not accept my apology  --  which I never intended to make , anyway  --  you can go to hell , Mr. Haught ! " " Humph ! The same to you , sir ! " replied Haught , falling in with all his men behind him . " But now I 've got you here I just want you to explain what you mean by hounding me with your stock detectives . I hardly parked my wagons when I came into this country and saw , in yonder gap of the mountain , the campfire of one of your spies . And ever since that day he has watched me through his glasses as if I were an ordinary thief . " " Well , I gave him those glasses , myself , " said Hightower . " And you may be pleased to know that Mr. McCutcheon reports " To hell with him ! " burst forth Haught . " He broke jail when he came into this country and rode in on another man 's horse . " Colonel Haught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he is one of my men , and I will not hear a word against him . So if that is all you have to say I will bid you farewell , Mr. Haught . " " Farewell to you , then , " scowled Haught . " But before I go I will mention one thing more . McCutcheonhas built a fence at the mouth of his canyon , to keep all of my cows from his spring . He has branded every maverick and calf in his own iron , and only last week he sold forty-two grown steers to the sheriff of Dona Ana County . At ten dollars a head ! " " A very good buy , " nodded Hightower . " Grown steers are selling at twenty . And , just to keep people like you from making their dirty insinuations , I refused to buy McCutcheon 's steers at any price . But he had his orders from the Cattlemen 's Association to brand any maverick he could ketch . " " And you gave that order , sir ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then you are a cattle-thief yourself ! " yelled naught . " The biggest thief of all . And you are teaching these stock detectives , who were hired for that purpose , to run off my cows by the thousand . " " They are engaged , " corrected Hightower , " by the Cattlemen 's Association , to return all stolen cattle in their brands , and I am sure these gentlemen who are riding behind me  --  " " Gentlemen ! " raged Haught . " Yes , gentlemen ! " returned a detective , riding212 Bloody Headout of the line and jumping his horse against the Colonel 's mount . " And if you think for a minute  --  " " Let him go , Lee , " spoke up Hightower bitterly . " By rights I ought to kill him , myself . But I promisedmy wife before I left home  --  " " All right , then , " came back Lee , " if that 's the way you feel about it . But I have n't got any wife . " " These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " are not accustomed to being called thieves , or to hearing me called a thief , so  --  " " You 'd better turn back , Colonel Haught , " suggestedLee , " before we have another funeral in these parts . Red Ryan was a cow-thief and he never deniedit , but  --  " " Let him go , Lee , " said the Captain , wearily . " Let him go . " " I 'd take my oath , " said Captain Hightower , " that Beau McCutcheon would never steal a cow . He 's a man of sound principles , brought up by a good father , who was a sergeant in the Texas Rangers . But just to try him out , boys , I 'm not going to say a word about those forty-two mavericks Haught spoke of . Beau has done good work in lining up that jury , and I spoke to him about the mavericks , myself ; but the principal thing is to get these cows branded , so they wo n't be such a temptation . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mavericks runningeverywhere it 's almost impossible to hire a man and expect him to stay honest . " I sincerely believe that the only way in the worldColonel Haught Again 213to stop this rustling is to get every maverick branded . Any kind of a brand , to have something to work on . Then you boys will all lose your jobs . You 'll all settle down , get a little bunch of cattle of your own , and in no time you 'll be rated rich cattlemen . And now that you 're young and full of blood you might as well work for me . You 're paid by the Association to round up these stolen cattle , but any time you see a place like Beau 's here , with good water , lots of grass and wild cattle , just ask for your time and I 'll get another man . And I hope we 'll always be friends . " But when a man like Colonel Naught  --  no matter how wealthy he is , is always complaining about thieves , there 's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JA cattle from the Panhandle of Texas to as far west as Tombstone , Arizona , and you boys wo n't get the half of them . Losing cows all the time , but at the same time I 'm making money . You 've got to expect a loss  --  and I do  --  but there 's one thing I can not stomach . To have a man call me a thief . Just to call off our feud I begged Colonel Haught 's pardon , and what does the damned fool do ? Begins all over again , complaining about Beau McCutcheon , calling the Cattlemen 's Association thieves . And right there in his own back yard he has Red Ryan hiding out  --  the biggest cow-thief of all . " Well , Pat Garrett killed him and now we 're startingall over again to round up the whole western range , saving thousands of dollars for every honest214 Bloody Headcattleman ; but sure as hell Henry Haught will buck us and do us all the dirt he can . He 's a kicker , a fighter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where one or two would do just as well . I do n't blame him for that , because I hate a thief ; but  --  well , here comes my boy , Beau McCutcheon ! " CHAPTER XXVIII " THIEVES ! " " NICE place , " observed Lee Hall , as he looked over Johnson 's Spring and saw the cattle filing in to drink . " How 'd you come to get it , Beau ? " " Well , " admitted McCutcheon , " the man that was here before me  --  " " Got killed by the Apaches , " grinned Miles . " And now there 's three men , waiting around on the peaks  --  " " Oh , they 're all right , " said Beau sarcastically . " Just hiding out , for fear the Rangers will get them . Or maybe the Sheriff of Lincoln . " " But since Garrett beat Red Ryan to it , " ended Miles , " w'y , all of a sudden , they 're gone . " " Do n't be too sure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Henry Haught . And I 'll tell you right now , Mr. McCutcheon , you want to look out for that man . It 's all right to feed these boys , when they 're on the dodge , but five hundred dollars is a big reward  --  " " And they never come down , " said Miles . " Exceptat night , when a man ca n't see them  --  " " But I know their tracks , " defended Beau. 215216 Bloody Head " Yes , but think of that reward , for the arrest and conviction of any man stealing a Haught cow . I 'll bet , " went on Miles , " I could take my Fugitive List and arrest every one of them , for something they did back in Texas . " " They 're just young , " qualified Hightower . " And I do n't mind a cow or two as long as their heart is good . But , now that Red Ryan is dead we 've got to turn over a new page . Ryan died broke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be broke . It was men like Butch Hardigan that got the money ; and by the way , boys , we 'll have to bear down on him . When he broke out of jail he moved to Arizona and started in , worse than ever . It 's these renegade cattle buyers that are doing all the damage , and I 'm going to stamp them out . But come over here , Mr. McCutcheon , and , while the boys are feeding their horses , I 'll ask for a little report . " I see you 've got your house fixed up , " he went on , kindly , " as if somebody really lived here . You were n't thinking of getting married , were you ? " " Not right away , " blushed Beau . " But Musette is still waiting for me , I hope . " " Musette , ' " repeated the Captain . " Is that the little girl you were sparking , down at Deep Lake ? Well , I 'm sorry to say you 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is against you . But she was a right pretty little girl  --  and a good one , I know . Did she give you the seeds for these hollyhocks you 've got planted ? " " Thieves ! " 217 " Well  --  maybe , " admitted McCutcheon . " A Mexicanbrought them over and of course I planted them . That was early in the spring . " " They look fine , " commented Hightower , " and I hope you can get married ; but I hear Haught has warned you away . " " Yes , " said Beau , " and I have n't been near her for a year . Because Ash has threatened to kill me , and I would n't want to kill him . So all I can do is watch her through these glasses ; and Mr. Hightower she looks fine ! If I can just get that girl  --  " " You 'll have to steal her , then , " advised the Captain , " and maybe skip out of the country . But that 's not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from her people . A miserable lot of clannish Southerners  --  " " Oh , I do n't know , " defended McCutcheon , weakly . " Gram 's all right . She helps me . " " Then you 'll have to steal her , too , " nodded Hightower . " And if you do n't know where to go , I 'm up on the Palo Duro . We 'd be mighty glad to see you and I can guarantee you a very good job . You have done very well in handling that jury and getting them to convict  --  when the man was guilty , of course . But this country is growing up . They do n't think it 's a joke to steal a man 's horse now  --  I beg your pardon , just a slip of the tongue  --  and the sheriff is our friend . I can see that . But what 's this fence that you 've built down below here ? Henry Haught was kicking about that . " 218 Bloody Head " He kicks about everything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his cattle were drinking at my spring he asked why I did n't build a fence . And when I built the fence  --  " " Yes , I know , " replied the Captain . " I 've seen a thousand men just like him . How do you get along with the sheriff ? " " Fine ! " answered Beau , brightening up . " And by the way  --  " He reached into his pocket . " I sold him forty-two mavericks last week at ten dollars a head and  --  " " Is n't that a rather small price ? " barked Hightower . " They 're fifteen or twenty dollars at Deep Lake . " " I know , " acknowledged McCutcheon . " But Don Manuel is my friend . And when Hockaday rode in and drove off every cow he had that had a Texas brand on it  --  well , the Mexicans did n't like it . " " Those cattle were stolen , every one of them ! " scolded the Captain . " Did he complain ? In any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beau . " He took it likea gentleman . But of course the comancheros  --  " " Made a business of stealing our cattle and sellingthem to the Mexicans . " " Yes , I know , " admitted McCutcheon . " But when he rode up here and wanted to buy some more , to take the place of those that were gone  --  " " You sold them for ten dollars ! " accused Hightower . " Thieves ! " 219 " Yes , and here 's the money , " said Beau , handing over a roll of bills . " They were mavericks in the first place  --  " " Mr. McCutcheon , " blazed forth the Captain . " You 're spoiling these Mexicans , I can see that . Now what do you want me to do with this ? " " Whatever you want to , " answered Beau . " I reckon a Mexican has got some rights in this countryas well as a lot of Texans  --  and Red Ryan stole them back the next week . " " Well , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while . But just to show Don Manuel that I know how he feels , I 'm going to give his money right back . On a big job like this there 's bound to be some injustice and  --  " He thrust the money into his pocket . " This is a hard game , McCutcheon , " he said at last . " And next time I see Henry Haught I 'm going to tell him what I think of him . He said you were going to keep this money , and make both of us out cow-thieves. "
