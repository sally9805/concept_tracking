Even simple-minded animals , such as fish , seem to size up situations . Male fish of nest-building species chase other males off their premises . They welcome nubile females . To the human observer it looks as if they judge approaching fish , determine their sex and promise , and act accordingly . But this , explains Professor N. Tinbergen in a recent Bulletin of the Wilson Ornithological Club , is giving them too much credit . Often all they see is a single characteristic of the approaching fish , which " releases " in them a train of automatic responses . <P> Such simplicity allows zoologists to do experiments with animals almost as if they were chemical compounds . Professor Tinbergen tells how he bothered a herring gull horribly by putting a red wooden egg in her nest . The shape and size of the egg were correct ; they tended to release the gull 's incubating reaction . But the red color touched off an attack reaction . The poor confused mother fought an exhausting battle between conflicting drives , until the " sitting drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could feel the egg 's tender shape beneath her , but could not see its color . So she finally settled down , in peace , to incubate it . <P> Bright Red Beacon . Most of Professor Tinbergen 's work has been with sticklebacks , prickly fresh-water fish that make good subjects for " releaser " experiments . The male builds a nest of fine sticks and tries to persuade females to lay their eggs inside it . He wastes no time on nonpregnant females . But when he sees one with a swollen abdomen , her shape acts upon him as a powerful releaser . He rushes into the lists of love , displaying his own releaser : a bright red belly . <P> The female follows him to the nest and swims in . He pokes her with his nose . This is a " tactile releaser , " which persuades her to deposit her eggs . Then a " chemical releaser , " given off by the fresh eggs , goes into action . Attracted by it , the male swims into the nest triumphantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Tinbergen observed this byplay ; then he took it apart . First he proved that the male would attack as a rival a crude dummy fish with a red belly like his own . Professor Tinbergen then made a dummy with a swollen abdomen . This released a chain of mating reactions in the eager male , which tried to entice the dummy into his waiting nest . <P> The females , too , were susceptible . They followed a red dummy as if it were a male . When a female was in the nest , Professor Tinbergen gently poked her abdomen with the tip of a glass rod . She laid her eggs willingly . <P> Professor Tinbergen concludes that breeding sticklebacks do not see their mates as fish of the other sex . The male sees only an egg-distended shape ; later he smells fresh eggs . The female sees a flash of red belly ; later she feels a prodding . They sense little more of each other .                  @ @ @
