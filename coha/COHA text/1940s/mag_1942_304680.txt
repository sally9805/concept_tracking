The first time that Robert C. Enos , president of Mellon-financed Standard Steel Spring Co. , met C.I.O. face to face was in a sheriff 's office . The occasion : a bitter , bloody strike in 1936 in the company 's Pittsburgh fabricating plant . <P> Out of the strike Bob Enos made some new friendships . One was with tall , gaunt Clinton S. Golden , onetime railroad fireman , then regional director for the Steel Workers Organizing Committee , and the labor leader who has worked most faithfully and intelligently to bring U.S. labor and U.S. management into partnership . <P> Between them , Messrs . Enos &; Golden put Standard 's labor relations on a mature basis , upped wages , lowered unit costs , above all worked out the means whereby the company and its men could talk over mutual problems . By 1941 there was only one problem which mattered : how to switch Standard from springs and auto bumpers into some kind of useful and profitable war work ? <P> Steelman Enos and Standard 's chairman , Willard F. Rockwell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ province of Bethlehem , Midvale and U.S. Steel . Laborman Golden , who holds no brief for the way most big-time steel companies handle their labor relations , jumped at the idea , explained it to the men . Against the bets of the whole steel industry , Standard began fabricating plate for tanks . <P> So well did Standard come out that the War Department wanted much more . Promptly Standard , whose capitalization is only around $3,000,000 and whose total gross in 1941 ran to $13,000,000 , led in the formation of a pool of other steel fabricators to do the job . Today the pool comprises 28 companies , 31 plants , and turns put 51% of all tank armor plate made in the U.S. Equally important , the pool makes the plate of special steels which use no precious nickel . <P> Standard 's improvisation of techniques , plus its pooling idea , is acknowledged by the War Department as one of the outstanding production jobs done during the war . Biggest shadow over the operation now is the semicompleted armor-plate mill which lumbering Carnegie-Illinois is putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carnegie is casting envious eyes at machinery now used by the Stand ard pool . Question now before WPB is whether the pool has not made the new Carnegie plant superfluous . <P> Scrupulously silent on that point , Steel man Enos is sure of another . Says he : <P> " One reason we were able to jump the gun is that we have sense enough to see that it 's good business to talk over production problems with our men . It 's good business because , damn it all , it 's their business . "
