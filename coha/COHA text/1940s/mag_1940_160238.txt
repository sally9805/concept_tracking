An ambition which comes upon many a citizen , especially when he is in his cups , is to lead a band . Most professional band leaders do not encourage these amateur impulses . But last week Leader Sammy Kaye , a smart , sandy , jug-eared young man whose slogan is " Swing and Sway with Sammy Kaye , " turned this yen to good account . When he was winding up a recent engagement at Manhattan 's Hotel Commodore , Sammy Kaye had let the enthusiastic drunks go through the motions of leading his orchestra , awarded champagne to the best and funniest . Last week , on a tour of movie houses , Leader Kaye put on stick-waving contests which drew 75,000 people to Detroit 's Fox Theatre . <P> The amateurs who supposed , as many do , that all they had to do was keep time with the orchestra got a quick awakening . If they omitted the conventional opening down beat of the baton , Sammy Kaye 's men kept mum . The orchestra played exactly as fast or slow as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trombone thought he saw a signal to come in , he did so regardless-with the result that periodically everything broke down . <P> In the finals , the audience 's applause gave first prize ( $35 ) to John Richard Pavlock , just out of high school , who conducted Whispering with a dignified beat-result of ten years ' listening to the Detroit Symphony . Charles Hill , a fat little high-school teacher , thrashed through the Darktown Strutters ' Ball , nearly fell down at the end , won $25 . Bill DeHart , gangling 15-year-old , took $15 for his wild , jitterbugging direction of Put On Your Old Gray Bonnet . By week 's end , when he moved on to hold contests in Cincinnati , Sammy Kaye was ordering batons in lots of 1,000 , giving them away to admirers as well as contestants , at the rate of 50 a day .
