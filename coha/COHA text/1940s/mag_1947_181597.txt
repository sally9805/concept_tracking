Budapest sewer-jacks stared in astonishment : the Direktor-the chief of sanitation himself-leading a bomb-hunt through the city sewers ! Up in the daylight , too , ' strange things were going on . Along all the main streets , police searched apartments , checked residents ' identity documents . " On a certain day , " the police explained , an order would be given for " strict security . " All windows must be shut tight and kept that way . " And do n't forget to hang out flags , " the police added . <P> What was up ? Budapest found out . Hungary 's great &; good friend , Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia , arrived to sign a treaty of amity and mutual aid . <P> The Hungarian government of Premier Lajos Dinnyes was taking no chances with the untoward . Neither were Tito 's security boys . Hungary 's friend made a formal entry by private train-but not until another train , crowded with soldiers , had tested the track . Resplendently panoplied , Tito strode into the Parliament building and marched to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and gestured with one hand . Obediently , a functionary rode the elevator to the top , descended again in a trial run . ( The elevator worked for Tito , too , but stalled on the next trip , trapping President of the Republic Zoltan Tildy between floors for 20 minutes . ) <P> The treaty signing did not take long . Tito stepped into his bulletproof limousine and-making a last-minute selection of one of three previously cleared routes - receded from the scene at a discreet 60 m.p.h . As the cavalcade flashed along , little jets of water spurted up through manhole covers ; the sewers had been flooded as an extra precaution . <P> " Why is all this necessary ? " a Budapester asked a policeman . Came the explanation : <P> " You never know what these Americans are up to . "
