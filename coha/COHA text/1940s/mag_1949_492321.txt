THREE years can be long ... or short . For me , the past three years have been short because they were crowded with what is surely the greatest experience life can hold for me . In November of 1945 I wrote an article , THAT WORD " BLIND , " for The Saturday Evening Post , when I could not see . An enemy land mine had taken care of that in the Moselle Valley of France on October 9,1944 . It destroyed one of my eyes completely and damaged the other so that only a tiny bit of light came through . This is the other half of my story  --  it is a brighter story than THAT WORD " BLIND . " It is the story of how I managed to regain almost perfect sight in my damaged eye , and how it feels to see once again . But the story of how this came about is not all bright . During the last three years there were lots of ups and downs . One entry in the medical record reads : " ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without much hope of success . " From the rehabilitation record : " Patient participated in program , but desires more surgery ... a doubtful procedure . " In the summer of 1947 the civilian surgeon in New York was almost ready to close the case . " A little sight in one eye , " he said , thinking out loud , " is a lot more than none . There is no guarantee with an operation . Let 's wait a few months for further surgery . " During that period I could make no decisions on my future . Job selection was out of the question . If I were sure I would regain my sight , I could go in one direction . If I were sure there would be no improvement , it would mean taking another course altogether . The decision would just have to wait . All this time the Army was having its misgivings too . I looked healthy and felt fine . My eye needed time more than anything else . Army authorities were uneasy because mine had now become a long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wanted to transfer to the Veterans Administration by discharging me . But I held my ground and stayed in . I argued that the Army had sent me to the civilian specialist in the first place . He had not rendered his final decision , so there was still a chance that I might see . I might never obtain his services through the Veterans Administration . I asked only that the doctor be granted a little more time for his definite answer before t he Army discharged me . The Army finally agreed . On my leaving Europe in December of 1944 , the doctor there told me that he could see some sign of lifting or clearing in the lower portion of the scarred area covering the cornea of my eye . He made it very plain that the best doctor for my condition then was Nature . " The more time given Nature for healing , the better the possibilities that somewhere , sometime , you may be helped by surgery , " he told me . Beginning in May , 1945 , I had four minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal of each was to put the eye in condition for a corneal transplant . The hope in this surgery was to reduce or eliminate blood vessels that were feeding the scar , which , in turn , was clouding the sight . The reason the doctors almost abandoned these operations was one I had already weighed . There was only one eye , and that was badly damaged . Just how badly , they could not determine because they could n't see behind the scar . So there was always the chance that further surgery might do more harm than good . The fog through which I peered was thickest right after the injury , and then slowly began to thin out a little until I could identify large objects . I had " travel vision . " It can be compared with the experience of standing in a room full of thick steam .. There is no clarity to any object or person . I was able to test the change in the density of the fog . My method was simple  --  a deck of playing cards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell a card 's front from its back . In the spring of 1945 , at an Army hospital in Pennsylvania , it was possible to tell the difference between face cards and numbered cards . Later that year , as the scar lifted a tiny bit more , the face cards became identifiable one from another . I could count the spots by holding the cards close to my face . Some furious games of hearts followed . It did n't take a kibitzer to tell me to " hold them close " ? I had to . Eighteen months more Passed . In February of 1947 , after another operation and upon acquiring a pair of heavy glasses , I could tell one picture from another . The spotted ones were " almost easy now . In the middle of last June , my surgeon felt that the eye was ready for the big test . " I am going to try a corneal transplant , " he said . This type of surgery had been up for discussion before . I knew it to be an operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the blind . I want to emphasize this so no one will raise false hopes  --  it may help one out of twenty-five blind . But if my doctor was ready , so was I. I suppose I should have felt that the approaching operation was the most momentous thing of my life . But to have dwelt on this line of thought would have had me in a mental turmoil ; something not at all help ul to the doctor . Several things contributed to my peace of Mind . First , for a long time many others around me in hospital had what I considered more severe Injuries . Then , too , long ago I found that there was nothing I myself could do to improve my sight . I was leaving it up to God and the doctors . Now that the decision was made , I was put on the list of those waiting for an eye . Waiting for one is not so long now as it was before the organization of the Eye Bank for Sight Restoration , Inc. , New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mlle in the morning until five in the afternoon , every day except Sunday . The doctor said it would be about ten days to two weeks , at the longest . Each time the phone rang thereafter , my wife and I jumped just a little higher . Finally , nine days later , at noon , came the call : " The ' material ' for your operation is coming in today . Report to the hospital within an hour . " I met the deadline , and preparations for an operation began . In most eye surgery , a general anesthetic is not given because the physical co-operation of the patient may he required , and sound sleep may cause the eye to roll up under the lid , making working on it very difficult . Pills are substituted to bring on drowsiness and relaxation , but not sleep . The pill process began as soon as 1 was admitted . Two and a half hours after I had entered the hospital , a nurse came to my room , and we walked to the elevator which took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put some drops in my eye and passed out a couple more pills . I was there about twenty-five minutes when they called my name . I walked into the room where the surgery is done and climbed on the table . The most trying part of the whole operation came when the assistant injected the local anesthetic in three different spots around the outside of the eye . I was conscious and could recognize the hushed voices familiar to me . I knew the work was going on , who was doing it , but could see nothing more than the very bright light overhead . I did n't know the operation had been completed until a dressing was put on the eye . It seemed about ten minutes later when they wheeled me back to the room . I had been gone slightly less than an hour . The actual transplant operation could n't have taken more than from nine to twelve minutes . There are two types of transplant . Mine involved scraping the cornea down , then implanting a clear cornea and suturing it on . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the latter , a circle or square piece of tissue is cut out of the area covering the pupil , and a complete new full-thickness piece of tissue put in its place and stitched . If the scraping method did n't work out in my case , it would , nevertheless , build up the eye for the perforating transplant , with a six months ' wait between them . I hated to contemplate such a prospect . And what would the Army say ? But there was nothing I could do ; the doctors were working for the same thing I was praying for , and just as hard . I settled down for the five days I was to be there . That evening , his operating day finished , the surgeon came to see how I was feeling . " Aside from being a bit sleepy , " I assured him , " I feel fine . " " Well , " he said quietly , " that 's good news . Be quiet and do n't move in that bed . When we started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraping , so we went ahead with the perforating transplant . " This information almost startled me into complete wakefulness . It meant four to six weeks flat on my back , permitted to move only from the waist down . Then suddenly I realized that I no longer faced the six months ' waiting period . The thought was very relaxing . ( Continued on Moi . 98 ) ( Continued front Pnae 2.1 ) As the graft began to heal , it grew very itchy . At times the nurse just about sat on my hands to keep them away from my face while I was sleeping . Poking at the eye to relieve the itch would have undone everything , even though the bandages were heavy . On the eighth day the surgeon 's assistant came in to remove the stitches . When my head cleared , the doctors told me they were pleased with what they had seen . " The graft is catching on nicely and is clear , " they told me . On the tenth day the eye was uncovered for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " the surgeon asked . " Can you count my fingers ? " It was as though I were peering through a piece of small pipe with water flowing past the end of it . The combination of a pressure bandage and complete darkness for ten days made things soupy-looking . I counted " Three , one , two " as the doctor held his fingers over the middle of my bed . It pleased him a lot , though I thought my performance pretty poor . Because of the jarring effect they have on the eye , shaving and brushing teeth had been prohibited before the stitches were out . Each day the discomfort from this grew more rapidly than my beard . I 'd done better in these two departments while fighting in France . Now I was happy to have permission to clean up . The next move was to get on my feet . Oh , the first afternoon I sat erect ! From the edge of the bed , my eye still bandaged , I groped for the floor with one foot . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was several days before I attempted a few steps . Whenever the dressing was changed I did manage to get a peek at the place that had been my home for the past two weeks . Everything seemed to have a light-brown shading , much like the sepia-colored movies of some years ago . However , for all that I dared use it , my eye might as well have been immovable . I felt sure it would fall out if it turned a fraction . It was almost a relief to have the bandage put back . Gradually it dawned on me that the eye was n't going to drop out . When they replaced the pressure bandage with a patch , on the fifteenth day , I fudged a bit by keeping the eye open behind the patch , so that it adjusted to the light more quickly . On the eighteenth day the surgeon came in for a visit . " It is coming along fine , the grafted area is healing well , and your new cornea is very clear , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the patch on and come to my office on Monday . " I had thought leaving the hospital would be a matter of much speculation and debate . But it was as simple as that . When I reported to his office , there were about fifteen other postoperative cases waiting their turn . When the surgeon examined my eye , he said , " Try leaving of the patch and start using the eye . Come back the day after tomorrow . " " No , " I answered unbelievingly , " you must have me mixed up with another patient . I 've only had this twenty days . You do n't want me to walk around with no patch on the eye ? " " Certainly , " he replied ; " you are very fortunate to be healing quickly , without complications . Just do n't abuse the eye . " How very , very lucky I was . It had been made plain to me that I had faced a definite risk . An eye had to be in pretty good condition over-all for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through , they could n't be sure about my eye or what was in back of the opacity of the cornea . In simple terms , the cloudy pane in front of the eye had been replaced with a clear pane . If one were to cover a window with a cleaning powder and then wipe it clean , the effect would be the same as a corneal transplant . But many unexplained difficulties can complicate a surgically successful operation . And infection may set in , causing the loss of the eye . This was the big gamble with me , since I had only one eye to begin with . I knew full well the doctor 's ability was only part of the answer . There had to be Another who was keeping a close watch . As one doctor phrased it , " We can only take the stitches ; the Lord heals them . " For the help we have had from both , my wife and I will be forever grateful . The fog through janilarY 8 which : Ill : been trying to see for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . gone . I soon found I had sort of forgotten how to translate my sight into action . For a few minutes I had no depth Perception and could n't determine how far away people or objects were . I sat down wife , Helen . I turned to have my first look at m ) . us.nTd.hIisemloseadde my eye **28;3459;TOOLONG to check my memory . Then , opening it , My memory had served me well . The strains of the past few years had not taken their toll of her beauty . The sparkling smile and bright , twinkling eyes were unchanged . Her hair style had been altered some . Now it Wee drawn rather tight into a knot at the back of her head . But I liked it . To great pleasure , I saw that she was wearing green , which I have always liked on her . She was all that I wanted  --  I Intended to spend a lot of time just look " 4 ) ing at her . I suppose it must have been embarrassing for her to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I wasp qwq and pencils . At the flip of a lapel I might be into a friend 's pocket to snatch his pen and begin writing . The old urge caught up with me . I spent so much time in one pen shop that the proprietor asked , " Are you thinking of going into the business or do you want a job ? " My new " seeing " eye got me in trouble one day at the Polo Grounds . My wife and I have always been baseball fans , and we took in as many games as possible . On our first day there was a large crowd , and Helen and I were separated . In situations like this , before the operation , she always stayed within earshot or close enough for me to identify the color of her dress . On this day we swept along with the other fans in search of the best Beats , with Helen ten or twelve feet ahead of me . I was watching the pregame activity on the field , but I followed her up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be poor ; a post blocked off part of the field . After checking the line-ups , I turned to comment on our location . I was sitting next to a stranger . Just then Helen appeared directly behind me , out of breath and fuming , " What is the matter with you ? Will you kindly look about and see . where you are ? " I had followed the wrong figure , face and color to the seat behind the post . Helen , seated ten rows away , had climbed over twelve other people to reclaim me . " Honey , " I replied innocently , " do n't be upset . Everyone looks alike to me these days . " That is one of the few times she has been licked on a comeback . Checkups with the doctor slowed down to one a week . The graft had healed very well . Now the great danger lay in the tissue becoming cloudy from an external cause . Any irritation or foreign body could bring this about . My own physical condition could contribute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly common cause of cloudiness in transplant cases several months old . " You may carry that eye around with you , but I have the primary interest in it , " the doctor told me . " After six months , it is all yours . " Then he made the only request in all the times I had been to his office . " Would you mind calling on the folks at the Eye Bank , " he asked , " and thanking them for their share in restoring your sight ? Before they established the bank , I often waited three or four months for ' material . ' , " The Eye Bank for Sight Restoration , Inc. , New York , was established in 1945 , along the lines of conventional banks in the commercial field . It has a board of directors to decide policies , a small paid staff to carry out these policies and perform daily tasks . For transplanting purposes , an eye is usable only up to seventy-two hours after it becomes available . The deposits in the bank are eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs a paper or informal agreement . It states that , upon death , the donor directs that his eyes be removed and sent to the Eye Bank . A stipulation is that death occur in a hospital where removal can be accomplished under uniform antiseptic conditions , by qualified doctors . When death occurs in a hospital before such a statement has been executed , and the next of kin knows the deceased 's wishes , the next of kin can direct that they be carried out . On removal , the eye is packed in a preserving solution ? and made ready for shipment . The Red Cross all over the country has standing arrangements with the Eye Bank to be notified when eyes are ready for transporting . They pick up the prepared package and deliver it  --  around New York , directly to the Eye Bank ; otherwise , to the nearest airport , where it receives top priority for shipment on the first plane . A friend the other day expressed regret that his eyes could never be used . " All my life , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , I have worn glasses . In fact , I 'm not sure I see as well with my two as you with your one . Mine just would n't be good enough . " " Look , " I explained , " it does n't make a bit of difference how good you think they are . You do n't see with the part needed for transplanting . All they want is the outermost part of the eye . If that tissue is clear , your eyes can be used . " Eyes that have never seen at all  --  those of stillborn babies  --  are used for transplanting cornea . Enucleation ? removal ? because of a tumor in the back of the eye is not uncommon , and even these eyes are usable . Only a doctor with a knowledge of eyes can really determine when one is not suitable . When a blind patient receives an eye , the identity of the donor is never disclosed to him . This is Eye Bank policy . The bank has a list of doctors doing this special type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one is ever paid for donating an eye . Nor is a patient ever charged for the eye by the bank . Donations are needed . The day I was in the office there were three calls for material , and only two eyes were available . Well , naturally , it seems to me this is a worthy cause . Before this last operation my eye tested 3/200 ? I could dimly see at three feet the things a normal eye could see at 200 feet . Six weeks after it , my eye tested 20/20 , normal sight . Some time after this I called on a high-ranking officer who had personally taken up my side of the administrative struggle in Washington with those who originally pushed for discharge . When I saw my friend he was really excited about the results . Recalling the work he had done on the case , he said , " You 'll never know how glad I am to share some of your joy in regaining your sight . That does n't happen very often . " Then , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were right too ! " The greatest thrill I got from my new sight waited for me at the end of a train rideto Louisville , Kentucky . There , waiting for me , was my two-and-a-half year-old daughter , Margaret Mary , whom I had never been able to see . I had tried not to draw a sharp mental picture of her . It seemed wiser to listen for the reactions of the family and friends as she grew from an infant . She was waiting at the railroad station . The train fascinated her more than the people leaving it . Given half a chance , she would have jumped into the engineer 's cab . On catching sight of my wife and me , she was stricken with shyness . For the moment , we were strangers to her . She would allow neither Helen nor me to pick her up . Clinging to her grandmother , she peeked at us from behind the safety of her skirts . It took strong pleading to get her into the same cab with us . As we turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observation , " Daddy 's eye is well . No bandage . " That tiny morsel was a reward to me . Once in the house , things picked up rapidly . Margaret brought her old friends Sally , Annabelle , Molly and Tommy  --  all dolls  --  along with their buggy , for my inspection . This act is reserved for those whom she wants to impress . She took us into her confidence and began relating the doings of her make-believe family . The imagination of a child is a wonder that will always entertain grownups , but that was not what fascinated me . It is the way Margaret divulges her feelings  --  as much with facial expression as with words . Seeing the raised eyebrows as she explained an intricate misdeed of Sally 's , and catching sight of the wrinkled brow that forecasts a deep-thinking " why , " are joys that every parent knows . They were doubled for me , now that I could see them . Margaret discovered very quickly that I was a push-over playmate . I ca n't remember even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's have fun . Swing me . " Although Margaret does n't understand exactly what has happened , she knows there has been a change . Prior to the operation , whenever she wanted a picture explained or a book read , she brought it to the others in the room . Several times when we were alone in the room and the picture was especially large , I was ready to do my best for her . But she would stop and say , " I 'll wait for Mummy Helen to come in . " Now , two or three times a day , she thrusts a storybook into my hands and assures me , " Daddy 's eye is well , and he is going to read me a story . " What can I do ?
