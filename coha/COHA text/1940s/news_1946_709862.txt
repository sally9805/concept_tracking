txt After ten weeks of hard and often acrimonious debate , the Paris Peace Conference is now entering upon the homestretch in a race to complete its work by Oct. 15 in order to permit the delegates to attend the United Nations General Assembly opening in New York eight days later . Under the rules drafted by the Big Four Foreign Ministers and unanimously adopted in a plenary session of the Conference yesterday , it will be as grueling a race as has ever been staged by a deliberative body . For in the nine days remaining the Conference must pass upon the final texts of all five peace treaties submitted to it . Though ' only three days have been allotted to the consideration of the Italian treaty and only one day each to the Rumanian , Bulgarian , Hungarian and Finnish treaties , and though each delegation has been limited to one thirty-minute speech on each treaty , it will still take almost continuous day and night sessions to keep to , the schedule , which will tax not only the wisdom but also the physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as bad as it sounds . The main work of the Conference has already been done in the various commissions , where most of the battle was joined on almost every point in the treaties , where the small nations staged their revolt against Big Power domination , and where innumerable amendments were submitted to improve the Big Four drafts . Now the full Conference is called upon to make its final recommendations  --  to vote upon each treaty , paragraph by paragraph , and amendment by amendmInt , in what is the final showdown . Though the Big Four Foreign Ministers will still have the final say , the United States is pledged to fight for every recommendation made to the Conference by a two-thirds majority , and even a majority decision can not remain without some effect on the final settlement . The final results of the Conference , therefore , remain to be seen . The hopes for at least tolerable results have been buoyed up anew by the conciliatory statement of Premier Stalin , by the wish for cooperation in spite of different political conceptions expressed after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all by Mr. Molotov 's new trip to Moscow , presumably for instructions which may help to break the present deadlock over the Trieste Government . But it is already clear that to a large extent the peace settlements have already been decided in the Commissions and that the full Conference will do little more than ratify their work . - These peace settlements are little different from those drafted by the Big Four . There will be some minor improvements , such as the provisions for justice and for human rights for minorities . And some important issues , like the Italian colonies and free navigation on the Danube , have been left for later consideration . But in fundamentals the previous Big Four decisions may be expected to stand . These decisions have been dictated not so much by the principles of their wartime pledges , but by the expediency of power politics , which at best could only produce a compromise between conflicting interests . Since Russia dominates four of the five countries affected , she has also reaped the greatest gains . In that sense , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes that it aroused , despite the best efforts of both the United States and the smaller democracies . But it is 31so far from being a failure . On the iiontrary . It demonstrated , for one thing , that since the peace pacts were largely predetermined by the military strategy of the war and the resulting Dower distribution , the compromise reached by the Big Four is the only ? ossible peace settlement at this time , Arhich should facilitate its general acleptance . But it also brought into the yen for all men to see why the corn  --  romise falls short of the high printiples to which the victors had pledged themselves and where the responsibil- ity for this lies . In so far as it helpe to mobilize world opinion to suppor the fight put up by the United State to put . these principles into effect a much as possible it also helped to say the compromise from being made wors through further one-sided concession to arbitrary power . That is , perhaps its greatest service to the world .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
