In his father 's English parsonage and at strict Westminster School , Christopher Windley Lonsdale " was brought up to respect a hickory stick . He thinks it did him good . When he emigrated to western Canada as a young man , he was appalled at the way sassy schoolboys talked to their elders . Since western Canada had no private schools to turn out little gentlemen , Lonsdale started one . <P> In the wooded wilderness of Vancouver Island , B.C. , Lonsdale began with six boys . Today Shawnigan Lake School has 100 boys and 27 masters . One-third of the pupils come from the western U.S. They are easily distinguishable when they return home by their habit of sirring adults and by their preference for " rugger " and cricket . Shawnigan Lake 's spartan Tudor dormitories , school ties , daily chapel and iron discipline are still modeled after the England Lonsdale knew 35 years ago . <P> When a new boy arrives at Shawnigan Lake , he is known as a " shadow " and is placed in the hands of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do no wrong and his substance is punished in his place . But the shadow soon learns to stand at rigid attention whenever he meets his headmaster , and to make his bed without a wrinkle . <P> To Christopher Lonsdale , now a ruddy , gruff and silver-haired 61 , the theories of most modern pedagogues are so much " poppycock . " " Keep ' em happy . That 's their motto . But dammit , there 's no easy road to learning . " His masters , who sir him as the students do , conduct their classes with Victorian formality , emphasize the Scriptures , Greek and Latin : Boys who break minor rules are punished by extra work . Those who commit more serious offenses get a caning in the headmaster 's office . <P> Last week , with the Michaelmas term at Shawnigan Lake under way , Christopher Lonsdale patted his German Shepherd Judy and pointed a moral : " If I had let Judy run wild and do as she damn wefl pleased as a pup , she 'd be a vicious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting them do as they damn please when they 're boys . If nothing else , we 're training boys to be less obnoxious. "
