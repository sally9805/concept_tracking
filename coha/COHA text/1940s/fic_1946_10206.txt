Let that be the thing to remember ! I do not know , I can not tell . We are the men and the people  --  surely we are that . We know the ends of the earth from the mountains to the sea . And yet , two seasons ago , a craft was wrecked on our shores and a man came ashore wearingdifferent metal from ours and speaking in no known tongue . Then he died , ere more could be known of him , but he was shaped like a man and there was the image of a sea horse tattooed upon his breast . Did he come from the sea itself ?

But , at the moment , I am not thinking of that sort of accident  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road untaken that might have led you to a hangman 's rope . I am thinking of the sort of people who are fate to others  --  and of my friend , John Tenterden . Because what happened to him began to happen at sixteen . And it certainly was n't at his own volition . He did n't even fall in love  --  he was fallen in love with . And yet that was the first of the things that changed his life . A quietish , dark-haired boy with a thin , pleasant face  --  up till then , he had jogged along the normal paths of adolescence in an average American suburb without particularly botheringhimself as to the ' whys and wherefores of existence . His father was one of the suburb 's four doctors , with a good , busy practice ; his mother , the daughter of an economics professor at Cornell . They were vigorous , hard-working people with a great deal of common sense , and the five children  --  John was the third one  --  had an excellent time of it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectable though not very fashionable section of town where they lived . It was the sort of family that believes in fresh air and cold baths and family jests and councils  --  they were all rather good at games and practical jokes , and a stranger in their midst was instantly made at home . That is to say , if he or she were " their sort "  --  if not , the Tenterdens agreed in private that the stranger was a stick or a queer duck , but redoubled their attentions , politely , nevertheless . If you looked at all old or frail , you were practically certain of having a knobby cushion put at your back by a hard-breathing young Tenterden and getting a coddled egg for breakfast whether you liked it or not . The anemic were given iron-tonic , the sturdy exercised , the despairing diverted and heartened by humorous stories in dialect and a common-sense philanthropy . It was a bracing atmosphere , and most people enjoyed it  --  the Tenterden house was popular , especially among the young . You could make as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there  --  there was always a screen door slamming somewhere , and a child or children running in , hot-faced , from a game , for a bath or a meal or a spare tennis-racket or a bandage . Proverbially , in such a house the mistress is pale , overwroughtand given to sick headaches  --  but Mrs. Tenterden was a wiry , brown-faced woman , much in demand for every sort of community activity from mixed doubles to charitydrives . She looked a little like an intelligent horse , just as Dr. Tenterden reminded you somewhat of a trusty , large-pawed dog  --  the kind of dog you forgive for barking because it does so with such a reasonable air . The combination was agreeable in the children  --  they inherited their father 's fresh color and their mother 's deep , equine eyes . The girls , indeed , might have been remarkably handsome , if they had ever taken the trouble  --  but taking that particular trouble is an art like any other . The Tenterdens were not very fond of art  --  they were well-informed and doughty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by teachers and public opinion , they considered , quite sensibly , a little queer . I was a nervous , rather sickly child , given to attacks of asthma , and I stayed for two weeks in their house , once , when 7my parents were away . It was very kind of them to do it  --  Dr. Tenterden was our family doctor , to be sure , but they took me in out of pure generosity . " We 'll soon get the roses in his cheeks ! " said Dr. Tenterden . The first few days of my stay , I enjoyed myself hugely  --  I thought I had never seen people who led so fine and tumultuous a life . After that , the glamor faded , insensibly but definitely . I do not think it was envy on my part for not being able to join in their games except feebly  --  after all , like most active people , they liked an audience and I was a most willing one . I missed something very much and did not know what it was . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . There was no privacy at all in the Tenterden household ; they were never happier than when all collected in one room doing different things at once ; even in the bathroom , with the door locked , you somehow It that the urge and surge of Tenterdenlife was waiting in the corridor and , at any moment , might rap brisk knuckles on the door . As for thought , that is probably a question of definition . The children always got excellent marks at school , and Mrs. Tenterden , as I say , was the daughter of an economics professor . No doubt Dr. Tenterdenthought about his cases  --  I know he worked like a bulldogto keep certain people alive . But thought , genuine thought , demands a certain amount of quiet for its flowering  --  and quiet was the last thing the Tentcrdens , as a family , liked or enjoyed . Perhaps I am exaggerating the effect of a sudden dip into the life of a large family on the temperament of a rather thin-skinned only child . But I know that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , at the end of the visit , I sank into its quiet as one sinks into a bed . Such was the environment in which John Tenterden grew up . As I say , he was quietish , for a Tenterden , but otherwise unremarkable . He had the darkest eyes in the family and the sort of olive skin that must have harked back to some distant 8 Latin ancestor . That made him rather an ugly baby , and once you started as anything in the annals of the Tenterdens , that thing you remained . Gwen was the beauty and Richard the scholar , and so it would always be . They were kindly and seldom twitted John about his looks , even when he became distinctly handsome  --  they simply saw no change . As the third child , younger than Richard and Gwen but quite a bit older than Bob and Sally , he filled an inconspicuousthough definite place in the family system . They would have missed and mourned him if he had been drowned in a pond , but he was neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he disciplined and petted ; he was merely John . It was also agreed in the family that John was rather lazy ; perhaps because be had a naturally good temper and no apparentspecialties , except a butterfly-collection . This showed a scientific interest , and the ' Tenterdens approved of it , though it was bard to keep any collection undamaged in the swoop of Tenterden existence . However , when John 's specimenswere accidentally destroyed , he never seemed to mind particularly . He merely collected others . As for what he was to become , Richard would naturally succeed to the practice , but John might very well be a doctor , too , unless he chose to be an economics professor like his grandfather . There was nothing queer about him , and Richard had hopes of him as a baseball-player , though , being an elder brother , he tried not to puff John up . When I was staying with them , John Tenterden showed me his butterflies , at his mother 's request . People wandered in and out as he did so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few silly questions . They did not seem to bother John . He showed me his butterflies politely but without apparententhusiasm , though his eyes grew darker as he did so . They were arranged with scrupulous neatness ; many were beautiful , especially the moths . I said , " That 's a peachy one ! "  |p119several  times  --  each time he gave me a quick glance . I had already got into trouble with the use of the word " lovely " at the Tenterdens and was trying to avoid it  --  they considered it slightly effeminate , except when applied to a sunset or a dish . Finally he showed me an enormous silvery creature , so beautifully mounted that it still seemed alive , in spite of the pin . The great pale wings were full spread , it seemed as if it had settled on the cardboard for a moment , and in another it would rise and fly 10 the lamp . I was a child but a sensitive one . I said , in a voice of sincere conviction , " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moth  --  neostera pallida , " he said , rather severely . " It 's fairly common . Except for the size , of course  --  it 's a fairly big one . They 're quite easy to find . " But I saw his finger go out to touch the spread wing very gently , and then draw back without touching it . He put it away , with careful carelessness . " Come out , some time , and you can help me catch them , " he said . " It 's quite easy . " " Are they all as lovely as that ? " I said , imprudently , for the second time . He gave me an odd look . " Sure  --  they 're all like that , " he said . " I mean the lunar ones . They must have fun , flying at night , though they 're silly about lamps . I like watching them , but you have to collect , of course . It 's scientific . " His eyes altered , as Gwen and Richard came bounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you old bug-hunter ! " said Richard , heartily . " Well , get it over with  --  the Collison twins just came and we 're going to ' nitiate them into the Ugliwugs . You can come too , if you like , " he said graciously to me . " It 's a terrible ' nitration  --  we did n't give you half of it because Mother said you 'd be scared and yell all night . "  | " All right , " said John obediently . Something had clicked shut in his face , and he was all Tenterden . At the initiation , which I watched with sycophantic dread , it was he who thought of the glue . He did n't repeat the invitation to go moth-hunting , and I was too shy to ask him . Indeed , he rather bullied me after that  --  which I felt , obscurely , was a pity because I wanted to admire him . When my parents asked me , later , which one of the Tenterdens I had liked best , I said Robert , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play with me several times , though it never worked very well . As a matter of fact , I detested Robert  --  he was younger than I but much stronger and liked to hit me in the wind . I used to bone , secretly , that John would come sometime instead of Robert . I could sec him coming up the steps with the , lunar moth in his hand . But it never happened , of course . Then we moved into the city . I began to go to school regularly ; and suburb and Tenterdens passed out of my mind . So I was n't there when the Fates began their game with John Tenterden , six years later . But nothing had changed very much in the Tenterden household . Dr. Tenterden was a trifle grayer and the youngest children made most of the basic noise . But Sunday night supper was even more of a bracing hullabaloo than ever , especially when Richard and Gwen were home from their respective colleges with their friends . They had many friends , all the right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who hit the line hard for their college and strapping girls who were as little afraid of a ten-mile hike as they were of a hard exam in Chemistry . Gwen was tentatively engaged to one of the young men , but on the most aseptic basis ; their caresses seemed to consist in each pushing the other a good deal when they were in the same games . As for Richard , he knew that he could not honorably marry for at least five years ,  | so he was not engaged . He did exercises with Indian clubs instead . Now and then , John made harmless sport for the visitorssixteen fi is always good sport to youth in the twenties . But notoften , for , as they generally agreed , he was a good kid  --  welllikedat school and center-fielder on the baseball team . And yet , oddly enough , he had no intimates , or , if he did , he did not bring them home . Perhaps it was not so odd . If he had brought them home ; he would have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so full . The Tenterdens noticed , vaguely , that when he came in , he did not bring a crowd whooping behind him . But life moved too fast for such details . And then the impossible thing happened  --  the first of the things that changed John Tenterden 's life . There was a girl named Mona Gregg in the class below him at school ; a sallow , straight-haired , narrow-eyed little girl with very red lips and a nervous habit of chewing the ends of her pencils . Her father had been an unsuccessful vaudeville actor before he got a job as night desk-clerk at the Myrick Hotel , and she had many of the faults of the theatre and hotel child , the sharpness , the precocity , the pertness . Her classmates considered her queer and something of a sneak , though they envied her familiarity with elevators , railroad trains and different kinds of ice cream . And she fell in love with John Tenterden as devastatingly as if she were eighteen and he twenty-five . At first , of course , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yawning gulf , in the ' teens . Then he began to notice that he was always meeting her in the corridors of the school . He would say " Hello , Mona " ; she would say " Hello , John , " and stare at him . Ile was popular enough , as I say , to be used to certain occasional looks of admiration . But this was different , from the first . He found himself noticing Mona more than he wanted to , without either in- terest or pleasure . She wore ugly plaid dresses in the winter  --  the collars were not quite clean . She did not try to fall into conversation with him , but somehow , he felt that she wanted to , and it affected him unpleasantly . Pretty soon he found that he breathed easier when he was in a classroom that she could not enter . But sometimes the grades were together in the same room . Then he would look up from his book and feel her eyes upon him  --  if he turned , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nervously looking away . Such things arc ridiculous , of course . I have often consideredhow ridiculous they are . Other times , other manners , and some of the Renaissance great ladies would still be in the schoolroom today . But there is no doubt as to the effect upon John Tenterden . He felt both furious and humiliated , and yet there was nothing lie could do . You can kick an unattractiveclog that fawns upon you  --  it is harder to kick a girl of fifteen , when you have been politely brought up . John Tenterdendiscovered that he was meeting Mona outside the school , in streets where she had no normal orbit . They would pass , he would say " Hello " politely , and she would meekly watch him depart . It got so that he went by the Myrick Hotel on the other side of the street , or kept away from it entirely . The look of the dingy entrance with its faded canopy reminded him inevitably of Mona , with her sallow face and red lips . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a grown man is a figure of ridicule in such circumstances , how much more so a growing boy . Once , she hung about in front of the Tenterden house for an hour and a half  --  fortunately , at a time when everyone else was out of it  --  and John , reverting to barbarism , had serious thoughts of peppering her with an air-gun from a window . But the Tenterden children had been taught how to behave with guns . Finally , when his pa/tience was exhausted , she went away . Oh yes , it was very funny . It was not so funny , too . It was a bad winter for colds and influenza , and Mona Gregg had always been a sniffling little girl . Nowadays , the people who dabble in amateur psychiatry might say that she developed pneumonia as a gesture of unrequited love . We were not so complicated , then . John Tenterden , when he heard that she was ill , had the entirely natural and boyish wish that she would die . But , unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience . As the case went up and down  --  Dr. Tenterden always talked about his cases to his family in his bluff , hearty way  --  the stings of John Tenterden'sconscience became acute . Only once or twice he dared ask a direct question ; that would have shown too much interest . But , by all the circuitous means known to adolescence , he tried to keep up with the progress of Mona 's illness . Sometimes it was very easy  --  his father would say , without provocation , at breakfast , " Well , the little Gregg girl 's comingalong nicely . " Or , " How I hate cases in hotels ! That Gregg child would have a fifty per cent better chance in the hospital if we could only move her . " In either case , John 's heart would give a jump of relief . He made a pact with his conscience  --  if he heard about Mona before he went to school , he would not have to worry again till after dinner . But once , at the height of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , and his agony became intense . I say " agony " with justification . By that time he had come to believe , you sec , that if he could honestly wish for Mona 's recovery , she would get well . And yet , if she did get well , he looked forward , with the bleak and limited gaze of boyhood , to a future perpetually haunted by Mona . Also , though the Tenterdens were hardly a prayerful family , he had heard , in the breezy Sunday school they all attended ( " Does n't do the children any harm to get a bit of religion " ) that God is not - deceived by false prayers . It is the letter that killeth and the spirit that maketh alive . Suppose he prayed , and God knew he did n't mean it , and Mona died instead , just to show him . An abnormal problem ? Look back in your own childhood and see what you see . His life split in two . It says a good deal for his character that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair show of being John Tenterden . But , within him , the struggle increased . School ceased to be a refuge  --  he remembered that when Pudge Perkins died , they had announced it at a special assemblyjust after noon recess . So now , when each period ended , he waited tensely  --  and , when work was resumed , he felt little relief . It had n't happened this time but it might next . One morning , he gathered from his father that the crisis of Mona 's illness was at hand . The knowledge weighed on him , horribly , all day . The Tenterdens were not Catholics but , that evening , after supper , he slipped away to the Catholic church in the poorer part of the town . He felt shy and ill at ease in the district beyond the tracks  --  the small stores , still indecorously open , had a different air to them , and people wheeled perambulators , fought , lounged and gossipedalong the sidewalks . A couple of boys jeered at him and he carefully paid no attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight , but these were not normal conditions . When he finally got to the church , he walked around the block twice before he was able to go in . It was an ugly church with a garish altar and puttyish stationsof the Cross , but to John Tenterden there was somethingforeign , mysterious , and powerful in its dimness and strangeness . He could not approve of it , but it was obviously strong magic . He tried to remember what little Catholic boys had said about their religion . You had masses said and burned candles . He looked around for candles , but , to his horror ,  |p125could  not see any . Then he saw , in front of a plaster statue , . what seemed like a lot of small night lights , each in a red glass . They were not his idea of candles , but they must do . He watched till he saw a woman light one to be quite sure . Then he went over , himself . There was a money-box near the statue  --  yes , you paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about the church , there were grown people , praying  --  thesight made him less shy and deepened his sense of magic . He lit a night light in front of the statue and sank on the prie-dieu before it , repeating , in a whisper , " Oh God , spare the life of Mona Gregg  --  do n't let her die . " After he had said this a sufficient number of times , he looked timidly at the light . It was still burning , and he felt better . He then went to the next statue and repeated the process . Fortunately , he had money enough for all the statues . At first , he did not notice their names , then , as he began to feel more at home , he became more curious . He even thought for a moment of omitting St. Patrick  --  Mona Gregg had once called a classmate a dumb mick  --  then superstitiously decided that that would break the charm . When he had finished his round , he felt intensely relieved for the first time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were still the candles . The thing had been done professionally , and Mona Gregg must live . He even felt a little proud of himself for having thought of the Catholic church  --  neither Richard nor Gwen would have thought of it . As he walked home through the crowded streets , past the flaringly lighted shops , they seemed no longer alien and disreputable but normal and friendly . Mona Gregg had been in a killing-bottle , like a ragged , sickly moth , but now she was going to get out . So certain did he feel of the future that next morning he did not even bother to waylay his father at breakfast . He set out for school feeling oddly light-headed with relief  --  he had slept heavily and hotly . It might be a headache coming on  --  he had them , now and then , though he had never spoken of them to his family . By the middle of the morning , there was a band around his temples and a dryness in his throat , but he hardly noticed them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a murderer , of not having killed Mona Gregg . Everything seemed bright and vivid and in a high key . When recess came , he played basketball fiercely and swiftly , in spite of the headache . After recess , they rang the bells for a special assembly . John had been a monitor for years  --  he found himself marching his file in . After a pause , the Principalrose and the room hushed . The younger children rustled and squeaked  --  special assemblies were always exciting  --  the older ones looked serious . The Principal cleared his throat . He had not called them together just to chat with them . He had an important announcement to make  --  a saddening oneAt this point , there was an unusual noise in the room  --  a sharp , frightening crack that sounded like a pistol-shot in the stillness . It was John Tenterden 's forehead , hitting the wood of the desk in front of him . He had fainted . Dr. Tenterden felt a little irritated and self-conscious that he had not diagnosed the influenza before  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a diagnostician . However , he made his family joke that evening about the shoemaker 's child going barefoot , and the family laughed . He was more worried than his manner showed  --  for a day or two it seemed as though John were going to be seriously ill . Then the fever dropped and the case became normal . Some delirium was normal enough , too , with high fever  --  but it was different , when it was your own son . Dr. Tenterden was not an imaginativeman . Nevertheless , at one point in the delirium , he had leaned forward and said in a steady , convincing voice ,  | " Stop it , John ! Mona Gregg is not dead . She is getting better . Do not worry about Mona Gregg . " It was an incident he tried to forget as soon as possible  --  he did not like to do such things . Nevertheless , he thought he had got through to the boy  --  and next day , the fever had begun to drop . He tried to shut out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mona Gregg 's dead . I killed her , " over and over from the bed . And then there was something about an announcement and the Principal . But John had not even heard the announcement the Principal was going to make  --  he had fainted before it was made , from all accounts  --  and the announcement had concerned a case of cheating in the Eighth Grade , with which John could not have been involved . Dr. Tenterden gave it up . He had heard religious old ladies swear like troopers under anesthesia  --  there was no use in a practical man 's meddling with such things . John 's constitution was good  --  on the whole , he mended quickly . Still , as his father said , it had been a sharp bout  --  hang it all , the boy and his mother might go down to AtlanticCity for a week , to the quiet hotel where Dr. Tenterden had sent a number of patients . John assented to this politely but without enthusiasm  --  he felt weak and depressed , as one usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had talked about Mona Gregg during his illness , and that worried him . But when his father remarked , in an overly casual voice , " Gregg 's taking his family out to Arizona  --  I advised it , if possible . The child 's lung is still spotty and it wo n't do her any harm to be in a dry climate for a year or so , " he knew that he had . John digested the information silently . His illness had set a gap between past and present  --  it now seemed absurd to him that he should ever have suffered so about Mona Gregg . He could not think of lighting the candles in the church without blushing . Everything had turned out for the best , and Mona was not even coming back to school . And yet , he knew that he must see her before she left , though he did not know why . He watched his time carefully and slipped out of the house when he was supposed to be resting . It was a raw Spring day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time he got to the hotel . The woman who opened the door of the small , stuffy suite looked surprised to see him  --  he had said " Mr. Tenterden calling " to the girl at the switchboard , and Mrs. Gregg must have expected his father . He explained , noting the resemblance to Mona as he did so  --  yes , Mona would pluck her eyebrows that way and wear that sort of a negligee with soiled feathers , when she grew up . " Oh yes , " said the woman , staring at him , " Mona 's talked about you . She was always so interested in her little school friends  --  always a popular child  --  George , " she called . A large man with tousled hair and a collarless shirt came out of the bathroom . " George , this is the doctor 's son  --  one of Mona 's little school friends . He came to see how Mona was . " " Oh , " said George , and stared at John Tenterden . " Well , your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll ever pay him , but he 's good . " " Now , George ! " said the woman . George yawned . " Sit down , Bud , " he said . " Her mother 'll see if Mona 's awake . " John sat down on the edge of a couch that had been a bed and would be a bed again . " We 're a little crowded , here . Since Mona was sick , " said George . " Well , I sleep days , of course , so it has n't been so bad . So you 're John Tenterden . Mona 's talked about you quite a lot . " He leaned forward , and his flabby face became suddenly the face of a snarling dog . " If I thought you 'd been up to anything with her , " he saidp129in a flat voice , " I 'd break your damn neck . High school kid or no high school kid . " " Now , George , " said the woman , coming back into the room . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he 's like , George . And you know what Mona 's like . " " Oh , I know what Mona 's like , " said the man . " She 's like you . She 's romantic . " He spoke wearily , but there was a trace of pride in his voice . " She can tell you the whole plot of a picture she 's only seen once , and the way she keeps up with the film stars , sick as she is ! Excuse me , Bud , I did n't mean anything . " " She 's made the most beautiful album since she was sick , " said the woman , proudly . " It 's called My Friends in Movieland . ' She 's had a letter about it already from Mary Pickford . She told Mary how sick she was . Well , she says she 'd be delighted to see you , young man . " John Tenterden got up and followed her into the other room . He had thought about Mona so much that he vaguely expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it was merely Mona Gregg . She was thin , she had on a red Japanese kimono , she was lying in bed , propped up with pillows . The small room smelt of sickness . On the medicinetablebeside her was a sputum-cup . " Hello , Mona , " he said gruffly , extending the package he had carried in his hands till the paper had fingerprints on it . " I 'm glad to hear you 're better . I brought you some candy . " He exhaled heavily , having rid himself of his speech . He had meant to add , " I hope they 're the kind you like , " but he had forgotten at the last moment . " Hello , John , " said Mona , in a mincing voice . " It was nice of you to come . I 'm not allowed to cat much candy , but thank you just the same . How 's school ? " " Oh , school 's all right , I guess , " said John , sitting down . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . "   " Did you have to have oxygen ? " said Mona . " I had to have oxygen and I guess it saved my life . It feels funny . " " No , I did n't have to have oxygen , " said John . He cleared his throat . " You must have been pretty sick , " he said . " I was awfully sick , " said Mona , with obvious pleasure . " I 'm pretty sick still . That 's why we 're going to Arizona . " " Well , Arizona 's a nice place to go , " said John , carefully avoiding her eyes . " Your mother said you 'd been making a  --  a scrapbook , " he said . " An album , " said Mona . " I call it My Friends in Movieland . ' It 's all about the stars . I 've got eleven autographed photographs already . Shall I show it to you ? " " Sure , " said John . She showed it to him . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Now and then , she would look at Mona . When she did so , John averted his eyes , as from something naked . In the look there was fear and a possessivelove , both undisciplined . It took quite a time but at last it was done . John Tenterden got up . " Well , I 've got to go , Mona , " he said . " I probably wo n't see you again before I go away . But I 'm glad you 're better . " He stood looking at her . A curious , wrenching sob rose to his lips and died there . It surprised him very much . He was infinitely glad to be free of Mona Gregg . He was sorry and humiliated that she should love him . And yet , there was something else  --  a queer feeling he could never have explained to Richard or Gwen . It was n't patronage but it was very like gratitude . He looked at Mona 's thin , hungry face . " Everybody at school 's talking about you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could go to Arizona , too . You ought to write some of us and tell us about it . " Mona 's cheeks flushed with satisfaction . " I do n't suppose I 'll have a chance to write ordinary letters much , " she said carelessly . " With my album and everything.  |p131But  I guess I could send postcards , anyway . You could pass them around the class . " " Gee , that 'd be great ! " said John , fervently . " Well , goodbye , Mona . " " Good-bye , John . And I hope , " she said , with hauteur and from the distance of one who gets autographed photographs of stars , " that you have a good time , too . " John Tenterden had been able to slip out of his house withoutdifficulty . Returning , he was not quite so fortunate . His brother , Richard , down for a week end , met him in the hall . " Hello , kid , " he said , " you look pretty well for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day ? Out paying a call on your girl ? " " No , " said John . " I believe he has , " said Richard , with relish . " He 's blushing . " He laid a heavy , fraternal hand on John 's shoulder . " Sometime I want to have a little talk with you , John , my boy , " he said . " You 're growing up , you know . And no kid brother of mine is going to make a fool of  --  oh , well , we wo n't go into that now . But that 's a date . " He waited for some expression of gratitude from John . As none came , he tactfully changed the subject . " By the way , " he said , " I was looking around for my old bamboo rod , thought you might have swiped it . But there is n't any light in your closet and I 'm afraid I smashed some truck of yours . Apologies , old man . " He pointed to the hall table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box a crushed lunar moth . ' I'lic wings were off the body , and one wing had been torn in half . ' Tried to stick it together again but I 'm not much good at that sort of thing , " said Robert briskly . " Suppose we 'd better throw it away  --  after all , a kid your age is n't interested in that sort of thing  --  "  | " You had no business to touch it , " said John , beginning to tremble . " Hey ? " said Richard . " You had no business to touch it . It was mine . You had no business to come in my room , " said John Tenterden . He paused . " You 're a stupid fool , " he said . " Kid , " said Richard , in a heavy voice , " you 've been sick . If you had n't been , you 'd get a licking , here and now . Keep a civil tongue in your head or you 'll get it anyway . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a confused voice , still staring at the moth . ' That 's better , " said Richard . He paused . Something glinted in his eyes . " And now , let 's go back to what we were talking about , " he said . " You were n't supposed to go out . Why did you go out ? " " I wanted some fresh air , " said John sullenly . Richard regardedhim . " You 're a bad liar , Johnno , " said Richard . " A dam bad liar . I 'm going to ask you once more . Why did you go out when you were n't supposed to go out ? " " And suppose I do n't choose to tell you ? " said John desperately , recognizing the gambit , a familiar one since childhood . " Well , then , " said Richard , judicially , " we 'll have to take other measures , sick or not . Come on , Johnno , we have n't done this for a long time . But if you think I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hotel-trashoh , I 've heard things about you , Johnno  --  " He laid a hand on John 's arm again . " Keep off me , you stupid fool , " said John and hit him . It was a beautiful punch , well-timed . Richard went to the floor with a crash and came up raging . It was , perhaps , fortunate for both of them that Mrs. Tenterdenreturned just then.  |p133John  apologized and was a very docile convalescent in AtlanticCity . Nevertheless , John was changed . He had time to think many things over , in the bright sleepy air . He was not sorry for hitting Richard  --  Richard would never bully him again . He was not sorry , now , for having prayed in the church . There was a whole world beyond the Tenterden cosmos  --  a world where people died and fell in love . He had suspected its existence with his mind , before . But now , he knew.  |p134THEY  ' D had better fireworks in the days of his youth , thought Mr. Veery , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You never saw a set-piece nowadays like Custer 's Last Stand . But all the same , the program had said that the Fair would end in a Mammoth Pyrotechnic Display  --  and he was bound he was going to sec it , rules or no rules . Whenever the Board of Directors paid its official visit to the James Bogardus IIomc for Retired Boatmen , Mr. Veery was on show . He sat in his immaculate little room as brisk and chipper as a canary in a clean cage , and whatever complaintswere made , there were never any from Mr. Veery . Old men in Homes are apt to be touchy and querulous ; Mr. Veery was always cheerful . Old men , from the very fact that they are old , are apt to suffer from ailments which remind a Board of Directors all too keenly of the uncertainties of mortal existence ; but Mr. Veery seemed always to be in the pink of condition . More than one female member of the Board discoveringhim in his splint rocker with his silver-mounted spectacleson his nose and his Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her breath with a little sigh and tiptoed away as if from the presence of a saint . " So neat , " they would whisper to each other as they passed on down the hall . " So gentle and appreciative  --  and that sweet little twinkle in his eye ! My dear , if only the rest of them were more like Mr. Veery ! " When Mr. Veery was sure that they were quite gone , hep135would put his Bible away and take off his spectacles . Then the twinkle would become even more perceptible . The Bible was a well-thumbed one , though not by Mr. Veery  --  and it opened automatically now to the third chapter of Kings . Mr. Veery had kept the inscription on the flyleaf , " To clear Andrew from his loving grandmother , June 1st , 1877 , " merely altering the " Andrew " to " Amos " with a few deft strokes of a pen . " Amos " sounded a little better , somehow , for a retired boatman . Sometimes he would wonder just who " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the previous possessor of the silver-mounted spectacles , he had no definite knowledge , beyond the Albany pawnshop where he had picked them up . Mr. Veery had been born with a twinkle , and he had never lacked a keen appreciation of the value of suitable stage properties . He did not need the spectacles , except as a property ; and the manuscript which he kept concealed in a cleverly constructedlittle recess in his floor-boards  --  Mr. Veery was a star pupil of the occupational workshop  --  might have given the Board of Directors some odd sidelights upon his career . It was romantically entitled , Memoirs of a Gentleman of Fortune , anc Mr. Veery wrote upon it every rest period in a copper-plateSpencerian hand . He plumed himself particularly on the Dedication , elaborately enscrolled in purple ink , " To the James Bogardus Home , within whose tranquil precincts this record of a busy life was penned . " But the New York Police Department would have been rather more interested in such chapters as " The Art of the Con "  --  " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Plant Them "  --  " Sidelightson Wiretapping and Other Race-track Cons . " For in these , Mr. Veery had put the results of a lifetime of experience . Like all beginning authors , he often wished for an audience . But being a sensible man , he had resigned himself , a little sadly , to a strictly posthumous fame.  | Not that he had any complaints to make about the James Bogardus Home . Far from it . Ten years before , he had picked out the dozing , upstate town of Winkelstone with its weedy little canal and its air of comfortable , rather stuffy peace as an ideal spot to retire and enjoy the fruits of a well-earned leisure . True , he had intended to retire in a slightly different way . He had planned on one of the big , rambling houses whose iron-ringed horseblocks and chestnut-littered lawns still lent a shabby grandeur to the Hill . But luck had been against him , and the James Bogardus Home was exceedingly snug . Retired boatmen who fulfilled the old-fashioned stipulationsof the Deed of Gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Directors was hard put to it to keep from fairly pampering their pensioners to death and yet carry out the terms of the Decd . Mr. Veery , of course , had had little difficulty with the stipulations . A genuinely retired boatmanmight be entirely authentic  --  but he never could seem as authentic as Mr. Veery . Yes , the Home was a real haven for the storm-tossed , thought Mr. Veery , sentimentally and in character  --  he always did his best to live his parts . Food , quarters , workshop , free library , tobacco-allowance  --  all were of the best . The company , to be sure , was hardly the creme de la creme  --  he had never thought to pass his old age next-door to an ex-captain of a garbage scow ; but Crutch was a decent fellow , except for his besetting sin of gluttony , and Mr. Veery prided himself on his broad-mindedness . The only thing one really missed was contact with the busy outside world . And after all , there were places where one might miss that even more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep up with the latest developments in one 's profession  --  one must not allow oneself to rust . Sometimes the developments rather took one 's breath away ; sometimes , on the other hand , they made one shake one 's head . All this bombing and racketeer/ing  --  crude work , very crude . Very little bore the mark of the artist , from such routine matters as poke-snatching to such higher flights as switching the ice in the old chewing gum stall . Of course , if one believed in mass production and purely mechanical efficiency  --  But Mr. Veery was a born individualist ; and it seemed to him , as it must always seem to the old , that his own tradition  --  the great tradition of the Con  --  had fallen on sorry days . He was content , on the whole , to sit by the fire and let the world spin  --  or had been , till the notice about Fair Week went up on the bulletin board . He had always loved fairs and fireworks  --  indeed , a fair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had started him on his career . But he had not realized until now how much it meant to him in his quietude to steep himself once a year in the noise and heat and dust of a gaping , good-humored crowd  --  to smell the hot dogs and the peanuts , roasting and sizzling  --  to hear the yelp of the barkers as the wheels-of-fortune spun and the brassy tune whanged out by the merry-go-round . " Oh , Lordy , the suckers , the dear , sweet , lovely suckers ! " thought Mr. Veery longingly . They were the world 's chosen  --  you could fool them again and again , and they 'd come back for more . They went to be fooled and dazzled , and tickled with feather ticklers , and spun screaming on human roulette wheels  --  they went to be human and silly  --  you could n't stick up your nose at any of it or you did n't have a good time . Mr. Veery knew all about carnivals , from the inside  --  but he 'd throw his ring at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the rest of them ; he 'd pay his dime to see the giant man-eating rats from South America and find they were ordinary muskrats , and never cheep . The fireworks alone were worth all the fatigue of the day.  | It was all Dan Crutch 's fault  --  overeating himself at the icecreamstand last year till he had had to be treated at the emergencyhospital tent . The paper had run a little squib about it , and the Board of Directors had not been pleased . So this year the Fair was out of bounds . If you broke out of bounds , you lost your special privileges , including tobacco-allowance , for a period of from one to three months . Mr. Veery had practicallyall the special privileges available , and he cherished them . But when he read the notice , rebellion stirred in his heart . Mr. Veery said nothing , but in secret Mr. Veery plotted . The first days of the Fair might be allowed to pass . But when the crowded finale came  --  and the Roman candles began to scatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if he had to do a crusliont in the best traditions of Dannemora . Remained the problem of chastising the errant Mr. Crutch . Dan Crutch , as Mr. Veery knew , was given to the consumptionof illicit midnight lunches , washed down with sarsaparilla , when lights were out . Such practices struck Mr. Veery as both greedy and anti-social . Somehow , it would be but poetic justice , if , on this night of all nights , Dan Crutch should suffer the penalties of his gluttony by falling just a little ill . It might teach him a lesson in manners and point out to the Board of Directors that the ill-effects of Mr. Crutch 's gormandizing could not properly be laid at the door of the Fair . " I wonder , " thought Mr. Veery ,  --  who was a privileged character in the Home dispensary ,  --  " I wonder if I still know how to mix a Mickey Finn ? " It was a long time since he had compounded one . It was a long time since he had picked a lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small side-gate of the Home  --  the one that nobody used  --  swung to behind him , he felt a certainp139pride . Neither hand nor brain had forgotten their cunning , and in spite of rules and Directors , he had made his escape unobserved . He stood in the sunshine a moment , free , breathless , and a little scared . The Mickey Finn powders still reposed in his pocket  --  Mr. Veery had had compunctions at the last moment ; after all , Mickey Finns were potent , and Crutch was old . Now , for a moment of cowardice , he wondered if he had n't better go back . They would n't have missed him yet  --  and it was a queer feeling , breaking even a minor rule after years of living strictly . But just then a car whirled by at the end of the street  --  a car with a streaming pennant , " Harwich County Fair , " and three hobbledehoys in the back seat , blowingsqueakers . Mr. Veery straightened his shoulders and felt like a man again . " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They do n't make ' em like us any more . " Half an hour later , however , he began to wonder . In a burst of energy and economy , he had resolved to walk the three miles to the fair grounds . But the road was not the road of everyday , but a crowded and roaring thoroughfare . The crammed buses howled past in a cloud of dust and gas  --  they could not bother to stop for one tired old man . L.catherlungedlittle boys bawled , " Ride , Mister ? Civc us a ride ? " and now and then some weary philanthropist paused to take one aboard . But no one seemed to see Mr. Veery 's hand , deprecatingly extended . No one , that is , until the green runaboutcame . Mr. Veery had noted it from afar -- it was going slower than the rest of the traffic liked . But the boy and girl seemed obliviousof shouts and angry horns . They were n't holding hands ; they were n't even sitting close ; but now and then she 'd look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirred a far memory . This girl had n't Molly 's hair , but there was ap140little , trusting turn of the head that reminded him . He boldly stepped out into the roadway , picking his moment . The boy with the nervous mouth jerked brakes expertly . " Listen , Grandpa , " he said , " this is no place for picking daisies . What 's the big idea ? " But he grinned as he said it . People generally grinned at Mr. Veery . " I beg your pardon , " said Mr. Veery with dignity . " I was looking for my son-in-law 's car . A green car like yours , and  --  " " Well , this is n't it , " said the boy , his eyes hardening . " Sorry , Cramp . " He started to release the brakes . But the girl touched his arm . " Oh , Bert , " she said in a low voice , " ca n't you see he 's old and tired ? He probably just wants a ride  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment . " Oh , well  --  " " I do so hate to trouble you , " said Mr. Veery mildly . " If only I had n't misunderstood Frank 's instructions . It was green with a Pennsylvania license , and he told me to meet him at the corner of Elm and Pine , but it seemed so crowded there . I 'm sure I had it written down . And then , if we did miss each other , I was to take a bus and find him at the AgriculturalBuilding . But the buses did n't seem to stop and  --  dear , dear , what will Frank think of me ? " He fumbled in his pockets with ineffectual hands . " Oh  --  glory ! " said the boy . " All right . Jump in ; the front seat 's rather a tight fit , but  --  " " I would n't think of inconveniencing you  --  " sighed Mr. Veery , squeezing in beside them . The girl gave him a little smile , and he felt at ease . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traffic-stream moved slower and slower till at last it barely crawled . He talked about Frank , and Frank 's business and the grandchildren . It was art for art 's sake , purely ; but it did good to his soul . And0p141while he talked , his bland eyes probed his companions shrewdly . Nice boy , but something on his mind . Doublebreastedcoat buttoned up , on a warm day , and slight bulge in inside breast pocket . All right as long as you keep the coat buttoned , but bad place for a wallet at a crowded fair . Nice girl and fond of the boy , but vaguely troubled and puzzled . Girl better dressed than boy  --  boy not quite at home with car  --  probably her car . Elopers ? He wondered . He 'd never heard of eloping to a County Fair , but all young people in love were crazy . He expatiated on little Orinda 's tonsillitis , watching the boy touch his breast pocket , as they got out of the car . They started to walk together toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped . " Look here , " he said , addressing Mr. Veery , " I do n't know who you are or whether your story 's straight or not . But I 've got a  --  a business appointment  --  andI do n't want to leave Kitty alone in this crowd . You look respectable , and anyhow you 're old . So if you 'll just take Kitty over to the Agricultural Building , I 'll meet you there in half an hour by the front door . That all right , Kitty ? Or would you rather take care of yourself ? " " My dear sir , " said Mr. Veery statelily , " I should only be too delighted to be of the slightest service to Miss  --  " " L-Lane  --  " said the girl with a little start ; then more firmly : " Katrina Lane . Of course , Bert . Run along . I 'll be perfectly safe . " Mr. Veery blinked . Ile had noticed the monogram on the runabout door and the twitch on the boy 's month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an L , for the letters tallied ; but Mr. Veery was perfectly sure it was not Lane . " A very pleasant man , if somewhat abrupt , " said Mr. Veery , as the boy darted away . He slipped a fatherly hand in the girl 's ann . " May I congratulate you , my dear ? "  | " Bert 's the finest boy in the world , " said the girl defiantly . " It is n't his fault that my father  --  it is n't his fault that he  --  Oh dear ! " she said . Mr. Veery patted her arm . " There , there , my dear , " he said . " Tell me all about it . " It was a very simple story , like that of most star-crossed lovers . Bert had worked his way up from messenger-boy to teller in the Eastmouth bank , twelve miles upriver , but the Longfords had been in Fastmouth since 1812 . " Though what they ever did except sit on their land ! " said Katrina Longfordirascibly . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very young . But it was the real thing . It was love . Mr. Veery clucked and sympathized . But it was going to be all right . Bert had a wonderful scheme . They were going to be rich . In fact , if Bert 's business appointment went well to-day-It was at that moment Mr. Veery 's mild gaze discovered , to his amusement , that Shad Pickrey was still working the fairs . Time might alter many things , but not that bulbous , imposingnose , those bulgy , fish-cold eyes , even glimpsed for a moment , briefly , as their owner dived between the back curtains of a tent . Mr. Veery noted the tent for future reference  --  it was away from the main traffic of the Fair . He felt glad that his own features were entirely normal . It was a great asset to be entirely inconspicuous  --  even negative in appearance . He 'd never really done business with Shad Pickrey , but he 'd known him by sight and reputation . And yet he gravely doubted if Shad Pickrey would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . Then his eyes widened slightly . Making hot-foot for the tent , in the manner of one who seeks to avoid observation , was the nervous Bert . Mr. Veery blocked the girl 's view as her eyes turned to follow his . " Dear , dear , " said Mr. Veery ,  | " we must be getting on to the Agricultural Building . I 'm afraid of missing Frank altogether , as it is . " He led her along , chatting ; but as he chatted , his mind worked furiously . Shad Pickrey and a nervous bank-teller . The coincidence was not encouraging . Shad had been one of the slickest come-on men of his time  --  and rough , thought Mr. Veery , very rough . " You know , " he said tenderly to the girl at his side , " you remind me of someone who was very dear to me . " Dear Molly  --  the sweetest , cleverest partner a gentleman of fortune ever had . He remembered that little , trusting turn of her head  --  it had got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of . He wished Molly were with them now . Suddenly Mr. Veery gave an effective start . " Do n't turn around ! " he whispered to his companion . " There 's somebodylooking this way  --  I do n't think he 's recognized you , but  --  " " Oh , golly ! " said the girl . " A big man ? Panama hat ? Oh , why did n't I change my clothes ! A big man who looks  --  looks as if he rather liked getting angry ? " " Yes ! " said Mr. Veery libelously . " Keep your back to him  --  he 's looking away  --  " " Father , " said the girl . " He 'll scalp me if he knows I 'm here with Bert . Oh , what shall we do ? " " See that fortuneteller 's tent ? " said Mr. Veery , pointing . " Hurry . Go in there . Have your fortune told . Several times , if necessary . He wo n't follow you there . I lc has n't quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man and apprise him of the untoward circumstances , which  --  " She seemed about to argue , for an instant . Then Mr. Veery hissed , " He 's turning ! " and she fled . Mr. Veery saw her disappearwithin the fortuneteller 's tent . " Safe enough there , " thought Mr. Veery . " And now for Bert . " He wormed his way patiently through the crowd to- ward the end of the roaring carnival-street . But it was not long before he saw the boy coming toward him . He looked jaunty , and as if a weight were off his mind ; but when he saw Mr. Veery , his jauntiness disappeared . " Listen , you old dodo , " he said violently , " where 's my girl ? Where 's Kitty ? " " Not so loud , " said Mr. Veery portentously ; " we are observed . " He looked for a nook of refuge and found it in a deserted corner to the rear of the grandstand . And thither he dragged his prey . " Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat-sleeve , " what were you doing with Shad Pickrey ? " Something flickered in the boy 's eyes and was gone . " I do n't know what you 're talking about , " he said . " You said you 'd wait at the  --  " " Imbecile ! " hissed Mr. Veery . " I do n't know what you 've got in that pocket , " and he tapped it ; " but if it 's still there , I 'm a Dutchman . " The boy 's hand flew to it instantly , as his face whitened . Then he gasped with relief . " Of course it 's still  --  What do you mean ? " he said . " Have you never heard of the envelope switch ? " said Mr. Veery patiently . " Or the box you seal with your own signetringso there ca n't be any mistake , and then  --  idiot , look inside ! " He shielded the boy from any observation as the latter drew out a long envelope and tore it open . They both looked inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fair job . The strips of paper had just the right weight and crackle . But Shad had always had his points . " Bank 's , of course , " said Mr. Veery . " What was it ? Cash ? " " No , " said the boy , his hands shaking . " Government bonds . Big ones . "  |p145Mr  . Veery whistled soundlessly . " That 's nice , " he said . " What was the come-on ? Green-goods , borax-mines , or that long-lost Australian cousin ? " " Why , " quavered the boy , " you know , when this revolutionhappened , in Spain ? Well , there was a fellow who  --  " " Great land of Goshen ! " said Mr. Veery reverently . " The old Spanish-prisoner game ! I did n't know it could still be worked . But live and learn ! " " But , " said the boy desperately , " he had all the proofsletters  --  documents . I  --  I bought a Spanish dictionary and translated some of them . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mr. Veery Iaconically . " Shad was doing very well with those letters in ' q7 . Only it was a Cuban prisoner , then . And you had to show them the bonds , just to prove they could trust you ? They were n't crude enough to slug you and grab them . Oh , no . " " Why , yes , " said the boy . " He  --  he said I 'd have to demonstratemy financial responsibility . But he did n't ask for a cent  --  and I did n't have the envelope out of my hands for more than a minute  --  " " Only somebody stepped on your toe and begged your pardon , and when you looked again , it was n't the same envelope , " said Mr. Veery . " Why  --  " said the boy . " As a matter of fact  --  Say , who are you , anyway ? " " Call me Santa Claus , " said Mr. Veery . " How many of them are in it ? " " Three , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Pendletonand two little sort of well-dressed fellows with kind of hard faces . They do n't say much , but he explained they were Spanish . " " They may be , " said Mr. Veery . " Or then again they may just be a couple of nice Italian guns . Did they ask much about the bank ? "  | " Why , Mr. Pendleton  --  he 's quite chatty , you know  --  he seemed pretty interested in banking . " " Oh , Lord ! " said Mr. Veery . " And most of the State cops here and the other cops busy with traffic . And the roads pretty clear north of Eastmouth for a getaway , because everythingwill be jammed around here just about when the fireworksbegin . Why , darling , it 's a set-up ! " " But I 'll stop it  --  " babbled the boy . " I 'll go right to the police  --  I 'll  --  " " You 'll go to the cops , " said Mr. Veery scornfully , " and tell them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbery because you just handed over some of the bank 's bonds to a man who called himself Pendleton , ' and now you 're afraid that 's not his name and lie 's a criminal . Or they blow the crib and you say you can help identify because  --  oh , do n't you see , you nitwit ? The robbery is your only out , and they 're banking on it . " The boy 's jaw tightened . " All right , " he said , " I can take it . They 'll believe me if I go to jail . " " I 'm thinking about your girl , " said Mr. Veery . " Now listen : We 've got to work this out . " As Shad Pickrey opened the little compartment in his traveling icebox  --  the compartment that did n't have pop in it  --  a beatific smile was on his face . Manna was certainly fallingfrom heaven . Not only had that poor sap of a bank-teller suspected nothing , but he was so firmly hooked that he 'd actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a little more ready cash . They 'd have to work fast to collect it , because the big blow-off at Eastmouthwas scheduled for nine P.M.  --  but Shad Pickrey had never yet let a bird in the hand escape him because there might be other birds in the bush . Ricci and the Flea could drive Uncle over to Eastmouth while Uncle collected his rollp147from the hotel safe  --  and he , Shad , would stay here and keep an eye on the kid . It would be a nice little outing for the boys , and they could give the bank the once-over as they went by . Afterward , another little drink , with the addition of some knock-out drops , would settle Uncle and the kid . They could sleep it off , under a tarpaulin  --  and if the cops found them in the morning , that would be just too bad . He had a funny idea he 'd seen Uncle somewhere before  --  but Lord , you met so many suckers you could n't keep track of them ! The old man certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This job would set him solid with the Bacciarotto gang , but the bonds were his private perquisite and he intended to keep them . They were safe inside the kewpie-doll on top of the icebox  --  it was his pet hiding place , and it always worked . He did not perceive Mr. Veery 's glance at the doll . Nor did anyone except the boy for whom it was intended . Mr. Veery was remembering more and more about his old competitor 's habits  --  and remembering that Shad very seldom changed his spots . " Well , " said Shad , lifting the paper cup , " happy days ! " He exchanged a grin with Ricci and the Flea . Uncle had nearly spilled the liquor , trying to help pass it  --  the old fellow certainly had his tongue hanging out . " To our castle in Spain ! " said Mr. Veery politely . They drank , bottoms-up . They shuddered . State Trooper Joseph Conoy , in his private mind , put it down to leprechauns . Else how would the stroke of luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Force ? And was n't the little old man like a leprechaun himself , popping out of a big car , as spry as a rabbit , and calling : " Officer  --  officer ! My friends have been taken seriously ill  --  will you watch them while I get a doctor ? " And then he whisked away in a runaboutas green as a shamrock , with a girl with a face like all the angels driving it ? No , he had n't taken the number of the runabout  --  but one look inside the other car had driven all else out of his head . Sure , he 'd captured two New York gangsters single-handed  --  and they weak as kittens with the desperate sickness that was on them  --  but that need n't go down on the report . And if he ever met the little old man again , he would n't believe it , and he 'd as soon think of meetingone of the cobblers of the hills ... . Mr. Veery , after he had got rid of the young people , dined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bottle of lemon pop , and felt his soul at peace . It had all been very interesting but a trifle exhausting , and he looked forward to his fireworks with childish pleasure . The administration of the Mickey Finn had been elementary , once he got Shad to produce the liquor ; but lie had not enjoyed his ride in Shad 's car . He had been wary enough to feign illness himself from the first  --  but even so , there had been some very bad moments . However , gunmen were proverbially suspicious of their colleagues , and they had just been turning the car around to go back and kill Shad Pickrey for poisoning them , when the Mickey Finn had  --  ahem  --  come to its full powers . It was lucky the State policeman had arrived so promptly ; but there was bound to be someone near that crossroads  --  and he had timed things as well as he knew how . The boy and girl had played their parts very well  --  the girl , particularly , in trailing the big car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shad quiet , with both of them in the throes of the Mickey Finn . He had given the boy as little as he dared  --  but there was no doubt it had a drastic effect . Foolish of Shad to hide the bonds in that same old doll  --  but Shad had always been a person of routine . Well , well , least said soonest mended , and a penny saved was a penny earned , thought Mr. Veery , as he in his turnp149patted his breast pocket . The bonds had gone back to the boy  --  and the boy would do well now , after his scare , but the smaller gunman 's wallet , while thinner than one might have wished for , came in very handy . And the trouble had been worth it , for the look on Shad 's face when he had finally revealedhimself . He 'd hardly seemed able to speak , when Mr. Veery had stuffed bills in his hand and murmured recommendationof the California climate . Well , it was an expense ; but for old time 's sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , having protected lovers , and been an instrument of justice in the courts of the ungodly , Mr. Veery stood and enjoyedhis fireworks . The set-piece  --  " Washington Crossing the Delaware "  --  was , he thought , particularly fine . The last red fire flared out  --  he thought , with a little sigh , of transportationhome . But as he turned to go , he was jostled  --  and he felt a slight , unmistakable tug at his coat . Mr. Veery opened his mouth to cry , " Stop thief ! "  --  and shut it again . He remembered , suddenly , the thin , sharpnosedwoman who had stood beside him  --  the one with the worn clothing and the beaten eyes . She did n't look like a professional ; she looked hungry , and even if she were a professional , it was a hard year . He felt the unskilled , desperate hands fumble and retreat with their booty , and said no word . After all , it was gunman 's money  --  fool 's gold  --  and Mr. Veery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the crowded bus , with sixty-eight cents in his pocket , but he would ride content . But as he made wearily for the exit , it did not even seem as if he would have to do that . For a hand fell upon his shoulder , and a voice rang in his car : " Well , Mr. Veery , really ! We 've been looking all over for you ! Flow could you give us such a scare ! " It was Mrs. Ransom , the matron , come in person to seek him . He sighed gratefully , as he thought of the comfortable back seat of Mrs. Ransom 's car . Then he had an inspiration . " Dear lady , " he said , removing from his lapel the limp but still fragrant little knot of flowers that had once adorned the coat of Katrina Longford , " permit me . A little souvenir . No  --  no thanks , I beg of you . Just a tribute . " " Well , Mr. Veery  --  " said Mrs. Ransom , uncertainly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well  --  " Mr. Veery smiled to himself in the darkness . He might not lose his tobacco-allowance after all . But when he got back to his room , he would take from its hiding-place a certain piece of printed matter and burn it . The circular spoke in no uncertain terms of a person sometimes called " Smiling Jim Atkinson , alias Sir George Rumbold , alias  --  " and a list . It contained the phrases , " Gentlemanly appearance  --  good manners  --  dresseswell but not flashily  --  " and Mr. Veery had always cherished it for that . But now lie would burn it  --  perhaps even burn his memoirs ; for he knew , by the ache in his bones , that that chapter of life was closed . He had joined with the world again today , and the world had been very exhausting . . . . For him , the peace of the Home and the games of checkers  --  the chair in the sunny corner  --  the gossip of little things  --  the life of a duly retired boatman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this last sally . And it was something , to remember fireworks , even when one was old.  |p151IT  IS N'T that we are n't proud of him  --  anybody would be proud of their father 's being Jordan Blake . Why , everybodyat school knows the songs from Random Rose and Hey Diddle Diddle , and the rest of them . And , whenever he has a new show , they talk about Victor Herbert and Gilbert and Sullivan and all the boys . And I 've been offered as much as twenty dollars for the photograph of Carolina Clay with " To Jerry Blake , whose father wrote Random Rose , ' from Carolina . " But , naturally , when you 're famous , it keeps you pretty busy being famous . It is n't like having the ordinary sort of father , if you know what I mean . Not that I 've got any complaints . I liked school and I liked camp . And if I wanted anything , all I had to do was write Miss Hacker and there 'd be a check and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometimes he 'd stick in a couple of the funny little drawings he makes on telephone pads . The fellows thought those were keen And some awfully soupy fathers come up to visit the school . I would like to have had him come up when I graduated . But it would have made an awful mess . Because I 'd written most of the Sixth Form Show  --  words and music  --  and that was one thing Father was serious about . He 'd leave you alone about most things , but he 'd never even let me take piano . He said one song-writer in the family was enough . And he said it with that cold little smile he uses on managers , sometimes . So I had to pick it up by myself  --  and get Nub Parsons to put And all the time I 'd be crazy to talk to him about people like Carolina and Noel Porter and the new show of his and the old ones . But he 'd only talk about those when he forgot . I guess he felt we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It used to get Bibs awfully mad when she was younger and got sent to bed earlier , knowing people like Carolina and Noel were downstairs while she was having milk-toast with the governess . I was luckier that way , because sometimes when he was sketching a song , he 'd forget to send me out of the room . And I picked up quite a lot . But he always remembered , finally  --  and then , generally , I 'd be sent to my cousins the week before camp . But this summer , I was sure things were going to be different . I knew Jakie wanted him to do a Show for that big barn of a 63rd Street theatre in the fall  --  and it would be the top , just to hear about that . I even had some ideas for a theatre as big as that . But when I got off the train , the old spell fell over me , as the books say , and pretty soon I found I was telling Father about Nub Parsons being a good egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the games . And finally , when Father said he 'd taken a house at Blue Point for the summer , it was just like a blow with a dull instrument , it did n't hurt as much as it stunned . " Well ? " said Father , when he 'd finished telling me . " Anythingwrong ? You do n't seem to greet the idea with cheers , Jerry . " " Oh yes , I do , " I said , prevaricating politely . Because Blue Point is all right , in its way , but it 's where Uncle Lambert goes with his family . And not even the presence of the Parsons ' could make up for Uncle Lambert  --  especially as Nub would be away , investigating the proletariat in a coal mine , which is what he was doing.  |p155Then  I thought a minute . " Will Bibs be there ? " I said . " Or is she going to camp again ? " He looked at me a little queerly . " No , Bibs will not be going to camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fourteen . I 'd like to see something of her . " " Well , that 's an idea , " I said . I did n't mean to be fresh or reproachful or anything  --  I thought we were just talking . " As you so aptly remark , " he said , with his cool little smile , " it might be an idea . In fact , we might be a reunited family for the summer . Learn to know each others ' hearts and chat around the fireside . What would you say to that , Jerry ? " Well , I could tell from the way he was trying to laugh it off that the very idea was an awful chore for him . " Okey-doke , " I said , because I was rattled , looking at him , and that 's another expression he hates . " How often have I told you , Jerry ? " he said , and then he stopped . " Sorry , " he said , quite nicely , " I forgot you were grown-up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I was thinking . " Look here , " I said . " How are you going to work at Blue Point ? The sea-damp 's awfully bad for pianos . Or so they tell me . " The little frown came back on his forehead . " I may not be working , " he said . " I may take a vacation . " " But the Times said , " I said , " that you were doing a show for Caro  --  for Miss Clay in the fall , with Jakic  --  and another one for  --  " I 'd forgotten I was n't supposed to know about his , plans . " Do n't believe all you sec in the papers , Jerry , " he said quietly . " If I do do Carolina 's show  --  and , by the way , I would n't call her Carolina , you 're still a little young for that  --  I suppose I could commute from New York . " " Why , yes , you could do that , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It might be better all around , " in that queer way . " Jerry ! " he said . And then he said , " Oh , well , what about those entrance exams , next fall ? Do you need any tutoring ? The system 's changed since my time  --  " So I told him , and it took quite a while and could n't have been very interesting . At least , it was n't for me  --  I wanted to ask him if he 'd seen Jimmy Manistee , the new comedian , and what he thought of him . But it got us along to bedtime . But when Bibs came home the next day and I broke the news to her , she said , " How perfectly foul ! I was going to be a group-leader at camp , this summer . And now I 'll have to tag around Blue Point with that slat-eyed Cousin Lucy of ours for company  --  and she 's a human meat ball if I ever saw one . " " Is that the English they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , do n't talk like Father , " she said . " If we 've got to , we 've got to . But I bet somebody cats snakes before the summer'sover . " And I could not but feel that her prognostications were likely to be justified . It was all right the first week , while we were still getting settled . But after that , the grimness set in . He did n't even bring down our regular servants or Miss Hacker . He got a special bunch straight from Boston that were about as cozy as iced codfish . We joined the Blue Point Club , which is highly select and quite as much fun any day as a first-class mortician 's , and we swam at the right hours and played golf at the right hours and took the sand out of our toes at the right hours , the way you always do in a place like that . I did n't particularly mind  --  I 'd been places like that before  --  and now and then , I 'd sneak some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a devil , spent most of her time trying to break down our Cousin Lucy 's morale , in a quiet way . But the whole thing simply seemed like an awful waste . And when I heard Father talking to Uncle Lambert about the gold standard and agreeing with every word he said , I knewp157something was terribly wrong . Uncle Lambert looks like a walrus and he thinks that civilization fell when women got the vote . I got up nerve enough to ask Father if nothing could be done about him , and he just remarked coldly that Uncle Lambert had put us up for the Club . And yet , I knew that he was n't enjoying it . I was next to him once , when we entered the Blue Point Club at the proper bathing-hour , and I heard him mutter , " Oh God ! Oh Montreal ! " And once , when I was going out fishing with Mr. Parsons , I looked back , and he was standing on the porch with the funniest look on his face . Naturally , Bibs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hard work . There was n't any life in the house , somehow , with Miss Hacker away and long-distance never ringing and Father never coming out of the study in his black-and-silver dressinggown and telling us , quietly but snootily , to go and drown ourselves in bathtubs if we had to but keep out of his way for the next eight hours because he was working on a song . Nowadays , he hardly touched the piano at all . " In fact , if this is life with the famous , " remarked Bibs , one day , when we were on the float alone , " give me old Camp Owatchee any time . At least there , you knew you could live through it because you always had . I 'm writing a novel called Rumble Seat Romance and reading the snappy parts out loud to Cousin Lucy , in deadly secrecy . They make her say , Oh , Bibs ! ' But even that does n't help much . Igo you know that Father told me not to roll my stockings , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " He asked Inc not to smoke in front of Aunt Susan . Said she did n't approve of the deadly weed for the young . " " As a glittering and sophisticated parent , Father is a flop , " said Bibs . " Before , I thought we were going to have a nice time knowing him . Now , every time he looks at me , I wonder if he 's going to send me to a nunnery . I do n't think he approves of his daughter , Barbara . Or maybe it 's both of us . Though Uncle Lambert said you were a fine , clean , manly boy the other day . Jerry  --  ouch , leggo of my arm , you fool !  --  And , if Uncle Lambert thinks that  --  all right , go ahead and drown ! " By that time we were both in the water and after we scrapped , we felt better . Only then we went back to the house and it was grim . Bibs went to bed early , as usual  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be asleep  --  and Father and I sat up . But you could n't have called it conversation  --  we 'd both start to talk at once and then we 'd both say " Sorry " and then we 'd neither of us say anything . Till , finally , I said I was going to the movies . They only change the bill twice a week at Blue Point and I 'd already seen it . But anything was better than just sitting there , making him uncomfortable because I was around . And driving over there , I thought of the times I 'd brought people like Nub Parsons back to the apartment and how , maybe , they 'd hardly see Father most of the time , but when they did see him , they 'd be pretty impressed . Because they knew he was famous and yet he never treated them like kids and sometimes , if he was n't busy , he 'd do songs . And people like Carolina and Bill Fields and George Kaufman would be coming in and out . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father to come up to school . And now , I just did n't get what he was about . Or why we were at Blue Point or anything . I did n't know if we were there because he wanted to build up some social stuff for Bibs  --  or because it was what he really wanted , instead of being friends with us  --  or what . And each time we sat down to talk , we got politer and farther apart . It had me jumping . And I could n't help feeling that , whatever it was , was my fault . Then , across the aisle , in the movie theatre , I heard twop159old rock-ribbed dowagers talking . And one of them was saying , " Well , I did think the Jordan Blakes would bring somethinga little new to Blue Point . And the children are passable enough . But the man seems just as stodgy as his brother . " The second dowager made a reproving noise with her tongue , and the first one went on . " Oh , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've known Lambert Blake since he wore short coats and he 's always been as dull as ditchwater . But I went to Random Rose four times  --  yes , Harriet , I did !  --  and I always wanted to ask the man who wrote it where he got the idea for that screamingly funny scene in the perambulator . But when I did , the other night , at the Hayes ' , he just muttered and looked shy . I hoped at least he 'd have some of his interesting friends down  - -  I 'm dying to see Carolina Clay . But I suppose he thinks they 're too good to waste on Blue Point . " " Oh no , it is n't that , " said her companion , quickly . " Do n't you know why he 's here ? He 's trying to get over the drug habit  --  that 's why he 's so nervous and shy . I got it all from Maisie  --  and that 's why he never touches the piano  --  it brings the craving on . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody says  --  " " Oh , is that it ? " said the other old sea horse . " Tsh , tsh ! Well , that explains the other night . I knew it must be something that  --  " Then their voices dropped and I did n't hear any more . But I knew I had to do something . For it was all too plain . If people like that could notice that the Blake family was n't itself , affairs were serious . And , somehow or other , I must be the false card in the deck . It must be me , for there was n't anything else to explain it  --  Bibs was too young . This was the first summer he had n't clone a lick of work  --  and it was the first summer I 'd been home . So , obviously , I had n't turned out the way he exp160pected or wanted  --  and it was getting him down . I even remembered a line I 'd seen in one of the gossip-columns , " Whispers say the new Jordan Blake show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family trouble or something . " Well , it 's pretty serious when you have to think a thing through like that . But I 'm modern . I know there 's no reason you should like anybody , just because he 's your son . They prove that in books , these days . And if you 're famous , why , naturally , grown-up children tie you down and get in your way . I did n't feel bitter about it  --  I tried not to . It was probably something pretty psychological that Father could n't help . With one of those Greek names , maybe . But it all boiled down to the fact that things had been all right for him when I was at school  --  and now they were n't all right . So what was I going to do ? Of course it would have been pleasant if we 'd gotten along and could talk like Nub and Mr. Parsons . Because Bibs , after all , is a girl and you ca n't talk the same way to a girl . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me pretty darn well for seventeen years . St. Henry 's is n't a cheap school . And all I was doing now was to get on his nerves so he could n't work and make people think he was a dope fiend . I had n't meant to do it , but it made me a good deal of a heel . Well , nobody likes to have a heel for a son . It shook me up pretty badly  --  for you do n't like to think of yourself as a heel , even when you have to . And I do n't remember much of the road , coming back . But , when I drove up to the house , I noticed the piano was going  --  and a nice , tricky melody , too , a Jick Blake melody . But it stopped as soon as my headlights hit the window . And that made me surer than ever . He did n't even want to play when I was around . I did n't sleep so well that night  --  I was too busy thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his coal mine orp161whether it would n't be better , on the whole , if I just made for the South Seas . You get crazy ideas sometimes . But we simply could n't go on the way we were going . And the move was up to me . I had to get out somehow and I did n't quite know how . He 'd be all right , alone with Bibs  --  after all , she looked like Mother . Or maybe I was n't even their son  --  maybe they 'd adopted me and never told me and now he was scared to , because I had n't turned out well . But if they had , I wished that he would tell me . It would be some sort of relief . And then , darn it , when I did get to sleep , I overslept and came down to find that Father had been called to New York . Well , in one way , of course that made things easier , because I could just hike out and leave a note on the telephone desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to . But I did n't like to leave Bibs alone in the house with those frozen-faced servants . And yet I did n't want to hash the whole thing over with her  --  it felt too sore . She did n't think I was a heel , but probably she was wrong . And I was stewing the whole thing over in my mind  --  and jittering  --  when the telephone rang after lunch . And it was Carolina Clay , of all people . " Oh , hello , Carolina  --  Dad 's in New York , " I said . I guess my voice sounded stiff . " Are you telling me ? " she said . " I 've just seen your respectablefather and he 's breaking Jakic Rosebaum 's heart because he has n't got a score in his left-hand pocket . But I 've invited myself down to your house for the weekend  --  so just run up the flag and be ready to pass me through Customs . I understand you need a certified blue-blood test to get into Blue Point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But Dad  --  is he coming down with you ?  --  But  --  " She laughed her wonderful laugh over the phone . " He thinks he 's bringing me down tomorrow , " she said ,  | " but he 's not . I 'm starting now , with Mother . We 're just in from the Coast and we 're covered with dust and yes-men and I 'm aching for fresh air . I 'm bringing the monkey , by the way . Get some anchovies for him , will you , darling ? He loves anchovies  --  the sinister little thing . " " But Caro  --  " I said and she just said , " Kisses , darling , " and rang off . And I went and held my head in my hands . Becauseit would be swell , of course , to see Carolina again , and she was more fun than anybody . But I did n't much want to see anybody . And what she 'd do to Blue Point I could n't think . And Father would hold me responsible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and leaving for the South Seas right away . But that would have been cowardly . She had the monkey on her shoulder when she got out of the car . And about 400-gauge stockings . And nineteen bags . And the kind of dress you do n't see on anybody else . And she 's older than Father and she can be as young as Bibs . And the servants nearly fell dead . And within five minutes we were all of us talking at the tops of our voices  --  Bibs and me and Carolina and her mother  --  and it seemed like old times . Then we went for a swim at the Club and Uncle Lambert was there . And Carolina had her arm in mine when I introducedhim to her and I could see in one brief glance that my reputation was gone , and probably Father 's too . And I did n't care  --  I felt swell . Because it was like old times . I even forgot about Father and what I meant to do . ' When she 's gay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then we were back at the house and her mother was upstairs showing Bibs six new ways to do her hair  --  her mother 's a grand old sport and Bibs always has been crazy about her  --  and Carolina was asking me what I 'd been doing . She knew about my writing songs  --  she always had . And I felt so good that I started playing some of the numbers from Sixth Form Follies and she picked up the hot number andp163started to go to town with it and it really sounded keen  --  as keen as I 'd hoped it would . " Gee , that 's grand , Carolina ! " I said . " I mean the way you sing it . " " I 'd be a fool if I could n't sing it , " she said . " It 's a real blues . Has Jicky heard it ? He ought to . " " Oh , gee , Carolina ! " I said , and before I knew what I was doing , I was crying on her shoulder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt terribly ashamed . She did n't try to be motherly or anything like that . She just said , " That 's okay , sport , " and let me use her handkerchief . And then we talked . We talked a lot . I suppose she meant her mother to keep Bibs upstairs . She may have . But I do n't care . She 's a pretty wise woman . If I 'd talked like that to anybody else , I 'd have felt like crawling into a hole in the ground . About in the middle she said , " I always told Jicky he was a raging idiot , but the man would n't listen to reason . " And then we talked some more . And when we 'd finished , she said , " Blue Point is right . Nobody could have named it more fitly . Now do you know what we 're going to do ? " " No , Carolina , " I said . " I am going to have a highball , " she said . " I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour on that couch . Now do n't argue with Carolina . " Well , I would n't have believed it , but as soon as I lay down , I was off , and I slept for an hour . When I woke , it was time to dress for dinner and I felt a lot better . I suppose it does happen to you , that way , when you 're tired . Then we all went to the Waldens ' party  --  Mrs. Walden was the old sea horse I 'd heard talking in the movies , and her Saturdaynight suppers for young and old are one of the more gruesome features of Blue Point . I wo n't describe what Carolinadid to that . She did n't have to do anything , really  --  she was just Carolina Clay . She was n't a bit vo-do-de-do  --  she can do that too , when she wants , but she did n't want . She was sweet and she wore a little cotton dress , with her hair done straight at the sides . But before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her the story of his life , and male and female alike were fighting to bring her lobster salad . I do n't know how she got the whole party maneuvered over to our house , when they asked her to sing . It was just one of the things she does . She started off with some old things , " Roses of Picardy " and " Poor Butterfly " and even " Swing Low , Sweet Chariot " for the old folks . Then she went into Random Rose  --  I was playing her accompaniments , of course . And just as she was in the middle of " Love 's A Dangerous Thing , " I looked up and saw Father in the doorway . His face was whiter than I 'd ever seen it and his eyes were frowning and he looked like a black-and-silver sword . But I was n't afraid of him a bit  --  I was n't afraid of him . I went on with the accompaniment and even put in a couple of tricks with my left hand . She did n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to do anything . As soon as she 'd finished the song , she said , " And now , nice people , we 're lucky . Because there 's one song in Random Rose that needs a man 's voice  --  ' Silver Stars . ' And we 've got the composer himself to play it for us.  --  All right , Jordan Blake . " Well , nobody could have helped himself when she spoke in that voice . Or almost nobody . But Father was n't looking at her , queerly enough . He was looking at me  --  I 'd swung round on my stool . And there was something funny in his face . It was n't as if he were angry , even . It was almost as if he were frightened . " Come on , Dad  --  please ! " I said , and , for some reason , they all laughed and started to clap . I saw Father stiffen ap165little at the laughter . And then he walked over to the piano , like a man in a dream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chorus . It 's an old song , as songs go , but they still make records of it . And , on the secondverse , I felt Carolina poke me , and I joined in . My voice is n't anything much but I know that song . He looked up at me while they were clapping . " You did n't look at the music , " he said . " I do n't have to , " I said . " Not with your songs . " And then they were clapping and clapping and , all of a sudden , his fingers were easy on the keys . We did " Nice Pair of Eyes " and " Roaming the World " and Carolina did " My House in Yonkers " and all three of us did the trio from Harum-Scarum . Then Carolina made me do " Sixth Form Blues . " I felt scared , doing it , but they seemed to like it all right . I looked at Father , in the middle . He did n't say anything , but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have kept them there all night if we 'd wanted . But Carolina knows how to break up a party , too . They did n't know they were being broken up  --  they thought it was their own idea . And when the last of them were gone , Carolina turned to Father . " You 'll excuse me for borrowing your house , Jick , " she said . " And Jerry and Bibs . But , at any rate , we showed Blue Point a real Bohemian revel . " She glanced around at the room and the empty glasses . " And on nothing stronger than ginger ale and chicken sandwiches . It 's a miracle . " " Blue Point flows with ginger ale , " said Father . " It 's about the only thing it does flow with . But I do n't understand about the sandwiches . I did n't think it could be done . " " Oh , Mother went out and bullied those Mayflower descendantsyou have in the kitchen , " said Carolina . " Mother can be a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've never dared , " said Father . " They know I 'm not a Cabot . It 's something in my left eye . But I 'm glad your Mother did . I hope it means they 're leaving tomorrow , " and he looked relieved . " If they do , " said Carolina , " Mother and I will cook up the famous spaghetti a la Clay , and we 'll take the children on a beach picnic . We might do that anyway . " " We might , " said Father . " Try and keep us from not . " " Shall we ask your brother Lambert ? " said Carolina . " He 's such a dear man . Such a sprite . He told me all about his liver and tried to hold my hand in the pantry . " " I guess there 's no use trying to establish a good social position with you around , " said Father , but he did n't seem to mind . " The best authorities are agreed on that point , " said Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry , " she said . " And thanks to you and Bibs for your charming hospitality . I 've been trying to marry your father for eight or nine years now , but he does n't seem to think I 'd make a good stepmother . Maybe you could convince him . Or maybe I 'll just turn around and marry Lambert . It must be wonderful to have a husband with a liver . So convenient when you run out of cornflakes . " Then she laughed her marvelous laugh and ran upstairs . " Good night , Toots , you maniac ! " Father called after her , and his eyes were crinkly and amused . Then he turned and looked at me , and for a minute we did n't say anything . " Carolina 's kidding , " he said finally . " You know that . " " I would n't mind if she was n't , " I said . " She 's a grand girl . " " She is , " he said . " We both knew your mother . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garden , " he said . " It 's smoky in here . " We went out and walked up and down for a little while . Itp167was n't hard , not saying anything , it was easy . Like not saying anything with any of your friends . I was thinking about the drawings Carolina had shown me  --  the funny little drawings he sends instead of letters . He 'd sent her these and they were funny , and not so funny . They were funny enough . But he thought we wanted another kind of father  --  somebody like Uncle Lambert or Mr. Parsons . And he thought we were right . And it was in the drawings . He 'd wanted to see me graduate , but he 'd thought he 'd better stay away . Of course , that was cuckoo of him . But I could understand it , because I 'd felt the same way about him . And then Carolina told me about the file in his office . That 's a secret between us and I 'll never tell him I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bibs ' first kindergarten work to that darn fool newspaper picture of me when I got the Raeburn Medal . I never thought he saved those things . He gave me a cigarette and we both lit up . " I 've never told you much about your mother , " he said . " You were young  --  and she would n't have wanted me to go in for the sob stuff . She had what she wanted , you see . She said she 'd rather have children than live to be seventy  --  and she thought you and Bibs were swell . You can ask Carolina , if you like . But that was the last thing she said , Well , Jick , I 've had what I wanted . ' It made it hard to talk about . " He stopped a minute . " I wo n't want you to think she was an angel , " he said . " She had a temper like the Irish Free State and she never was on time in her life except in the theatre . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to talk about  --  even to Carolina , for a long time . You see , she would n't have wanted me to do the sob stuff . " " That 's all right , " I said . " I understand . " " Do you think Bibs does ? " he said , and his voice was n't like his ordinary one . " She was fond of Bibs. "  | " If she does n't , I 'll get it across to her , " I said . " I wish you would , " he said . " Bibs is rather a problem to me . " " Oh , she 's got her wheels in line , " I said . " She has , honestly . She 'll go a little haywire when she 's eighteen and probably write a bum child-prodigy novel . And then she 'll marry somebody who 'll chase her around the house with a shotgun if she tries any tricks and have eight children and end up as a darn good Indian . " And , funnily enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be true . " Well , that 's some comfort for a worried parent , " he said . " She used to scare me stiff when she was younger . " I saw the end of his cigarette glow red . " In fact , you both did , " he said . " I depended on your mother so much for all of that . You wo n't understand that till you 're married . Well , I had to go on working , afterwards  --  it was the only thing I knew how to do . " " They were pretty expensive schools , " I said . " Why not ? " he said . " Your mother and I used to say that the best was none too good for the Blakes . When we were heating bouillon cubes over a Sterno on the road , " he made a little noise in his throat , " I got some things wrong , " he said . " I ought to have known . But people keep telling you about the right environment for kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I used to wake myself up at night after you 'd gone out , " I said . " And then there was a fellow at camp  --  you did n't say anything about camp . " I could feel him grin through the darkness though I could n't see it . " I learned from a cross-eyed German who played in a rathskeller , " he said . " And Lambert told on me and I got the licking of my life . Your grandfather always liked Lambert . But his father lost a lot of honest Boston money , tryingp169to manage an opera troupe in the Fifties . So that 's three of us . " He chuckled and pulled on his cigarette again . " Carolina said I was an idiot , " he said . " And she was right . But I did n't want you to get into anything because of me . And when you 're inside the game  --  well , it does n't look the way it does from the outside . It 's a tough game , you know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . Till you try it . And then you know . It works both ways , of course . Do you really want to go to Harvard , by the way ? " " IA-huh , " I said . " I want harmony and counterpoint and all the theory I can get . And work on shows in the summer  --  the practical stuff . Lord , I have n't done anything yet ! " " We 'll get Jakie down for a weekend , " he said . " And you can listen in on the new one  --  you 'll be a help . I want to do a real light opera and he tells me I ca n't , but we 'll show him . I 'm sick of just working for hit numbers and ringing the same old changes . And I want to have him hear your blues . There 's one spot in it that 's a little tricky  --  you 've got to allow for the singer , now and then . But the rest goes right to town . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll go through the whole score . Okey , son ? " " Okey-doke , " I said.  |p170w  0 N I ) E R what sound they listen for now at night , in the small towns sunk in the wheat of the mid-continent  --  the young and ambitious , the ones who mean to get away ? The drone of the mail plane , I suppose ; and that must be different . In our day , it was the long , shaking whistle of the Limited  --  it did n't even stop for water at Sapepas then . Tom Allin taught us to listen for it , I think  --  I do n't know about Edie Foster , for Edic was always independent . But I was content enough with Sapepas till he came . Oh , I meant to be a doctor , like my father , but that was because I liked my father . I daresay I 'd have made a passable one , and not killed more than the average number of patients . But Tom Allin changed all that . We heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with city clothes and a stickpin  --  and we wondered what Butch Malone would do to him . It did n't take long to find out  --  Butch cornered him in the Townsend lot , the first day , after school . We 'd all trailed along to see the licking , and I trailed with the rest . I 'd rather liked the neat , cheerful looks of the stranger , and he 'd caught Bud White on the ear with a perfectlytimed spitball while Old Watson 's back was turned , so he obviously was n't a sissy , in spite of his city clothes . But that did n't make any difference  --  it does n't , in boydom . He was a stranger and Butch would lick him  --  you could tell that from their sizes . And if he ran , we 'd all of us chase him home . I admit that for a single moment , when they facedp171each other , there was something in his face that made me wonder if he might n't lick Butch  --  an odd , interested quality that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things do not happen that way , except in books . Butch knocked him down twice and rubbed his face in the dirt , while the rest of us ( lanced and jeered . It was very easy  --  so easy that when he got up for a third time , Butch stood back and waited , contemptuously , for him to run . But he did n't run . He shook his head for a moment and stopped crying . Then he said to Butch in a perfectly friendly , rather superior voice , " You fight all right , but you do n't put your weight behind it . You ought to get your weight behind it , see  --  like this . " And he turned from Butch and delivered a blow at the air , while the rest of us gaped . He was obviously mad , and we waited for Butch to abolish him . But instead he advanced toward Butch . " Put your right foot back . Now hit me in the stummick , " and he dropped his hands to his sides . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the rest of us waited , astounded . " Hit me in the stummick , " said the stranger , with a pleasantsmile . " Right here "  --  and Butch did . This time there could be no doubt of the weight behind it , for the blow sent the stranger spinning . But , after a moment , he rose again . He was , obviously , in difficulties with his breath , but his voice was quite clear . " That 's better , " he said . " Now try it again . You 're learn-ing . " Butch 's face became very red and again we jeered  --  but not at the stranger now . Butch drew back his fist and let it sink again . He looked around the ring desperately . But our faces gave him no comfort . " Aw , run along home , bub , and tell your mother she wants you . I do n't fight babies , " he said in a weak , unconvincingvoice , and the rest of us knew , from that moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever a new boy came to town , it was still Butch Malone who fought him . But that , as we explained to the new boy , was because Torn Allin knew too much about fighting . We could n't ring Torn Allin in on a new boy  --  it would n't be fair . He was our own man of destiny , and we recognized it from the first . There were questions enough about the futures of many of us , but never about Tom Allin 's . He was never the best or the worst at games , but the games themselves were better because lie was there . There is the strength of earth and the strength of fire . And then there is the strength of water  --  and that was something like Tom 's  --  running water , finding its way with a resistless , laughing motion to the place where it wishes to be . He was n't a particularly good-looking boy , as looks arc measured . But you liked his looks , you liked their quickness and tidiness and the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complete interest . I can never remember seeing Torn Allin bored  --  if he started being bored with a game , he changed it or went away . He would n't suffer boredom . And with the world of grown people , where most of us stumbled and fumbled , he was completely at home . We would have resented that in another  --  we did n't , in Tom . He had none of the " good boy 's " tricks and it was obvious that he did it without effort . Every employer he ever had  --  and he must have had a dozen or so when he was a boy in Sapepas  --  was glad to have him work for him and sorry to see him go . And then there was his background and his family . We like to think of our Lincolns coming up from shiftlessness , our Grants from the tanyard . The only son of a brilliant drunken lawyer , to whom Sapepas was the last step on his long road downhill , and a vague , large , flustered woman with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shone by contrast and character against his mother 's triviality andp173his father 's bitter defeat . It made us all feel better , to think of his coming from that . A little as if we 'd done it ourselves , as if we were responsible for his charm . Of course there were dissenters  --  there are always dissenters . There were those who pointed to his father and mutteredabout what was bred in the bone being sure to come out in the flesh . And there were one or two , like old Mrs. Witchett , who shook their heads and murmured darkly that that Allin boy was too clever by half . But such comments only lent a tang to the way the rest of us felt . There is no fun in believing unless there are unbelievers , too . It puzzled and distressed me not a little to find my father  --  well , not exactly an unbeliever , but unconvinced . There was one time in high school , when Tom got interested in medicine and asked my father questions whenever he had a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he made it seem a glamorous profession , even to me who knew about the long drives in the battered buggy and the pile of unpaid bills . And my father was polite enough , answering , but there was never the rare warmth in his voice which came when he talked to a red-wristed country boy like Ed Freed . I could see Tom , in a spotless robe , performing delicate operations  --  I could n't see Ed Freed doing anything more exciting than delivering a calving cow . I said something of the sort to my father once and he grunted . " Yuh , " he said . " Well , there 's calves I would n't want to deliver  --  they got more legs than babies . But I reckon Freed could do it . He can carry eggs in those hands of his  --  ever notice ? Of course there 's a lot of folks that do n't know how to do anything but operate . Oh , sure , I reckon your friend could make a doctor . " He smoked a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , it was him brought Ed Freed around here . I wo n't forget that . " I did n't quite understand him , but I was glad , on the whole ,  | when Tom stopped collecting medical knowledge and started getting us all interested in amateur theatricals in Edie Fos -- ter 's barn . You know her as Edith Edmands , if you 've ever been to a theater  --  they 've called her " the American Duse " once or twice . But we knew a stringy , freckled little girl with stuck-up manners and very black eyebrows . The Fosters were the richest people in town , but we 'd all rather made fun of Edie till Tom decided she was somebody to be cultivated . And then we flocked after him like sheep . Yes , I 've seen him rehearse Edith Edmands  --  and I 've seen her cry and stamp , at fifteen , when he made her play the villainess instead of the beautiful heroine . But he knew what he was doing , and she played it uncomfortably well . We did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Tom 's plays , not hers . And yet , he was n't an actor . But , with his boundless enthusiasm , he dragooned and drilled the rest of us into an interest , whether we felt it or not . When Edith Edmands made her first success in New York , the critics were surprised at her range , but I was n't surprised , remembering the plays we 'd given . The Fosters were really pathetically grateful to him  --  they 'd worried a good deal about Edie 's not being part of " the crowd . " After that , we all thought of Tom and Edie as " going together , " and the girls thought Edie lucky . " Humph , s'pose Foster 'll take him into the bank now , " said my father . But Mr. Foster did n't . He was known at the State University , however , and Tom applied for the Kennedy Scholarship and won it . I know , because I was second  --  they took appearance and character into consideration as well as marks . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt no jealousy . No jealousy indeed , rather gratitude  --  was n't I his best friend and had n't he called me " Old Persistence " from the first ? It is odd what a nickname may do to you when it 's given by somebody you admire . I ca n't remember being par/ticularly persistent as a boy . But if Tom said I was , I must be so , and I tried to live up to the character . And then , halfwaythrough my junior year , when my father died , I discoveredI really had it  --  the power of hanging on . Torn was gone by that time , and I could n't thank him , but the discovery accounts for any success I have had . I asked Tom why he called me that , once  --  and he looked at me in the puzzled way he sometimes had . " Oh , you just look that way , " he said . An odd interest woke in his eyes . " You look like a beaver , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did n't know whether to be insulted or pleased  --  even my parents did n't know , then , that I 'd given up the idea of doctoring and was hanging around the men who were building the new county bridge . " Sounds interesting , " said Tom , and I took him down there , very pleased at being able to show him something for once . But it was he who introduced me to the engineer in charge of construction  --  the best friend I 'd made myself was only a gang foreman . We spent most of our time there for three weeks , and it was a turning point in my life . After that , Tom went less than I did and finally stopped going , but the engineer was used to me by then . Tom and I talked a good deal after that about all that was going to happen when I was a great engineer and Edic was a great actress and he was great . And yet , lie was curiously uncommunicative about his own ambitions . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at him and know . I remember Mrs. Allin 's saying to me once , in her vague voice , " Tom says you 're going to make a name , Harry . So you must n't disappoint him . " It was probably her idea of humor , but my ears reddened . " Oh , Tom , " I said . " Well , you know Tom . Tom 's about the finest fellow there is . " " Yes , Tommy 's very clever , " said Mrs. Allin placidly.  | 76 " Even Mr. Allin says so  --  and Mr. Allin should know . IIe 's never given me the slightest trouble , either , " she went on , with almost a sigh . " Even when he was a little boy , people took to him . They 'd want to give him candy and things , but after he got sick once , he was very sensible about that . And he always played with the nicest children in the neighborhood  --  heseemed to know just where they 'd be . Mr. Allin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling well , but I 'm sure I do n't know what he means , " and she sighed again . But I thought I knew what Tom 's father meant , and felt proud of my friend . There was , indeed , a changeling quality to Tom  --  he played in the mud of boyhood with the rest of us , but the mud never seemed to stick to him . He shook it off as he shook off anything that had ceased to interest him  --  without rancor and with the most amiable of smiles . I did n't see as much of him at State as I 'd have liked , for I transferred to the engineering side as soon as I got oriented . But I heard about him , as we all did . Freshman year he went out for track and would have been elected freshman captain if he had n't pulled a tendon just before the big meet . As it was , he only missed out for freshman-class presidentby half a dozen votes and was automatically taken into the best fraternity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he was out in a track suit during the season and the coach spoke of him as a fine example of State spirit . We won all our meets that year , and , somehow or other , most of the college felt that a good deal of the credit was due to Tom . And though he was n't given the Ribblesdale Essay prize , we all knew that was more of a victory than a defeat , for the barbarian from the Great Lakes who carried it off went around swearing Tom Allin must have written the better paper . I was delighted to see him on the train going down to Sapepas , and we planned things for the summer that he andp177Edie Foster and I were going to do . And then we got home and discovered that Edie Foster had run away the previous night with the leading juvenile of a cheap stock company that played a week in Sapepas . His name was Edmands and he was forty years old , with a removable bridge . We all thought Tom behaved very well about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself and Edie , but the Fosters had come to treat him more and more like a son . All he said to me was , " I hope he does n't let her play things like Camille too soon . She needs a lot of comedy first . " I thought it a profound and subtle cry from a wounded heart at the time . But he had that queer , interested look on his face , and I think now he meant exactly what he said . He was admirable , however , in arranging a technical reconciliationby letter between Edie and her parents , and in cheering the latter up about the whole matter . George Allin died while Tom was in Europe with them ; they had always meant to take Edie one of these days , but now they took Tom instead . And when they got back , they sent him to Yale for his last two years . It is difficult for an outsider to come into a class as late as junior year , but Tom succeeded in it perfectly . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him as one of the class leaders , though he did not go out for track . In fact , it is a little difficult to find out from them what he did do , except acquiesce in being elected to various committees and a senior society . One man told me he had done a great deal with the dramatic association , but I looked in his class book and the only role listed for Tom is that of Owen Glendower in Henry IV . I 'm sure Tom made an excellent Glendower , but it is a small part . I had spent the four years at State in a daze of work and I was fairly excited about my own future . But when I saw Tom , the last summer I was ever to spend in Sapepas , the old charm returned and my own future seemed small beside his . He had come from visiting friends in the East and brought a classmate with him  --  a terrifyingly well-tailored young man named John Cowenden , with shy , spectacled , amiable eyes . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Fosters . I gathered that he was a young man of great wealth and extremely rigid upbringing who had done very few enjoyable things in his life . There was a sister , too  --  Tom showed me her picture  --  a sweet , unformedface , scared and burdened by family and wealth . I will say for Tom that he treated the whole visit with utter honesty . John Cowenden stayed in the dingy house where Tom 's father had died cursing life and the Republican Party with his bitter tongue ; they saw the feed store and the drugstore where Torn had clerked and the raw frame schoolhousewhere lie had gone to school . And all of it excited and enthralled John Cowenden ; you could see him thinking of Lincoln and Grant and the rest . There was n't a thing Torn did , from his behavior to the Fosters to his behavior to his friend , that was n't right and admirable . And yet , somehow , I knew there was something wrong . I knew there was something wrong , because I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom put his hand on my shoulder and said with his light laugh , " You 've changed a lot , Old Persistence . You used to be quite a responsibility . But you 're going to astonish them now . " The compliment did not please me and I asked him what he was going to do . He frowned a little . " Oh , John , here , wants me to go in with his father , " he said . " The chump thinks I 'm cut out for a captain of in-dustry . " " Well , you know perfectly well what father thinks , " said John , his shy face eager . He turned to me . " I tell you , " he said , " Father is n't impressed by many people . Tom 's the only one of my friends who  --  Oh , shut up , Tom , you knowp179it 's true . Tom 's worried because he thinks he 'll be given specialtreatment , but I tell him  --  " " A nice little sinecure in a good climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what I really want . " They went on talking and I listened . Presently the name of the sister came in . " She 's a nice kid , Lisa , " said John with more affection than the words showed . " But , Lord , Tom , I wish you 'd talk to Father about her . He 's dead set on stickingher in that deadly Swiss school my other sister hated so , and she 's too scared to stand up to him . " " She ought to have a year in Europe sometime , " said Tom judicially . " But not in a school  --  and afterward . " I saw interest in his eyes . " Well , she 's such a nice kid , " said John , helplessly . " And you know Father . " " She 's more than a nice kid , " said Tom slowly . " There 's something about her  --  well , she could be quite a remarkable person if she had the chance . " " Gosh , Tom , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course I 've always thought she was pretty swell , but  --  " Tom was looking at neither of us . He was looking at a distance . He was thinking . " The way she does her hair , " he said . " I mean probably she 's been told to do it that way . Or the maid . But for her kind of face  --  " Then I knew what was going to happen and I felt a little sick So it had all been for that . The charm and the interest in others , the self-deprecating modesty and the candid blue eyes . I could see , in a sudden flash , like a flash of lightning , the whole history of his rise . Now it would reach apotheosis  --  in a little while he would n't even have to pretend to be a great man any more . I muttered something and went away from the porch . Tom waved cheerfully after me , " So long , Old Persistence ; see youp18o tomorrow , " but I knew it was goodbye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the firm I was hoping would take me telegraphed me from Chicago that evening . When I got Tom 's wedding invitation , a year later on the top of a South American mountain , there was a line scrawled at the bottom , " Good luck , O.P. ! I wanted you for best man ! " I stared at the stiff , expensive paper dully and dropped it into the fire . It 's hard to lose an ideal when you 're young . After that , there were many years and a lot of work . I kept track of Edie Foster from the papers and Sapepas through Mother 's letters ; but whenever I came to Tom Allin 's name in her letters , I would skip . But I could n't have skipped as much as I intended , for I gathered that Tom 's mother had not long survived her husband  --  and that was Tom 's luck again , I thought bitterly and unfairly , for it severed his last link with his past . The Fosters moved to California shortly after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And once , in a society column , I saw that Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Allin were opening their house in Paris . But I do not usually read society columns and that item confirmed my distaste . It was n't till just before the First World War that I ran across his trace again  --  in London , oddly enough . It may be immodest to say so , but I had become something of a success by then . At least enough of a one to be given medals and asked about . It is n't always the best engineers who get the medals , as I know well enough . However , that sort of thing can be pleasant , after years in the corners of the world , and I enjoyed it sufficiently . Ronny Frazier-Spykes was more or less my guide and mentor , and a very able one he proved . He told me that one of the people I must meet in London was Mrs. Harley Dunn . " Extr'or'n'ry woman , " he said , in that rather bleating voice that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tightp181place with him . " Beautiful in a way of her own  --  pots of money  --  everybody goes there . Paints dashed well , too , I believe , for an amateur . American , of course  --  most of our best hostesses are . And jolly good for old Harley , too , if not quite what the family ordered . Oh , no stain on her character , but divorced , and the Dunns were always strait-laced . First husbandan extr'or'n'ry chap , for that matter  --  chap named Min . " " Allen ? " I said , with a queer tightness in my throat . " With an i , " said Ronny . " Allin . Unusual name . Most delightful chap from all accounts , but would run off with a snake charmer . Or that 's the story . Anyhow , she had to divorce him ; had n't even met Harley then . " He ran on , but I was thinking . And when I did meet Mrs. Dunn , I thought even more . She was , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture I once saw in Tom 's hand . And when she summoned me to tea with her , to talk about Tom Allin  --  Ronny must have babbled  --  it was the nearest thing to a royal command I have known . I did n't mean to be confidential , but she had the art of the hostess , the art that puts you at your ease . I began to speak of the early days and Sapepas , and every now and then she would say , " Yes , that 's so like Tom . " Then she , too , began to talk , and the story was not what I had expected . She spoke of Tom without rancor , indeed with a good deal of affection , and yet with an odd detachment . A seed might speak that way of the wind that carried it to other soil . " Oh , I 'll always be very grateful , " she said . " And yet , sometimes , I feel as if it never had really happened  --  being married to Tom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if I had n't met him I 'd still be in New York , being Father 's dutiful daughter and scared to death . He made a person out of me  --  I could n't even do my hair properly or say three words to a stranger without looking frozen . And yet  --  well , he was  --  "  | " A changeling ? " I suggested . She stared at me . " How did you know ? But of course you know . He was delightful and fascinating , and I never really felt married to him , even at first . " She laughed a little . " When we got to Paris , " she said , " he made me throw away all the clothes I 'd ever had . That was after our first year  --  his one year with the company . He 'd made a brilliant record , too  --  even Father said so . But he was tired of it  --  he said he wanted to write . So we went to Paris . He bought all my new clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how . " She looked at me very simply and directly . " It was n't the money , you know , " she said . " It never was that . I thought you 'd like to know . " " I 'm very glad to know , " I said . " No , " she said , " it was never the money . Oh , he liked not having to worry about it  --  he 'd worried a good deal as a boy . And buying things , sometimes . But the pictures were Matisses  --  even Father 's beginning to admit they were an . investment . " She laughed a little again . " I do n't love him at all , " she said . " I do n't think I ever loved him . And he hurt my pride when he  --  left . But I 've no complaints . " She smiled deeply . " I 'd never have met Harley , in New York , " she said . " He thinks we would , but we would n't . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brother John . " I went back to something else , wondering . " You said Tom Allin wrote ? " Her eyes were mischievous . " A dozen poems and three stories , in three years , " she said . " And they never were publishedanywhere . But that was how we met Gide and Proust and Shaw . I wrote him one letter , before I married Harley . Oh , just to say I did n't feel hurt any longer  --  and , well , perhaps to tell him how happy I was . After all , I 'm a woman . " She smiled . " And I got a scribble back from him , on cafe paper from some place in Belgium . Just saying , Be sure top183have one white living room . It suits you . ' ' Well , as a matter of fact , when we did over the house  --  " She paused . " And I have n't heard since , " she said . " I do n't know at all . But there 's just one thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassed . " If you should hear  --  and there ever were a question of money  --  well , I feel a very real debt , and Harley would understand . " We left it at that , and a few weeks later , when I was in Paris , I attempted to find some trace of Tom . It was all true , even to the snake charmer , though that lady I was , perhaps fortunately , unable to find . He had kept an extraordinary salon during his last year as Lisa Cowenden 's husband . Then the path became a darker one . The snake charmer , apparently , had not been good for him . He had not stayed with her long and had gone on to worse things . I did not write about them to Mrs. Dunn , but I heard quite enough . I felt sorry and yet relieved  --  sorry for the completeness of the downfall , and yet relieved , in a queer way , to find that it had n't been the money he wanted , after all . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wastrel than a mere adventurer . I tried very hard to trace him , thinking I might do something , but the trail ran into a dead end  --  I could not even find whether he had returned to America or not . And then the war came and blotted many things out , but every now and then I would think of him , even through the war . And when I met Edie Foster again , in New York , in the jumpy ' 30 's , we commiserated together and shook our heads wisely . She , too , had tried to trace him at one point and met with no success . I had to stay in New York that winter and we became excellent friends . And every now and then we would talk of Tom Allin , his charm and his promise and his boyhood and how sad it all was . " If I 'd only been able to marry him , " said Edie rather solemnly one day , " I might have saved him . But  --  well , JoeP184Edmands was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed me , it did n't seem quite real . He was a changeling , Harry . His wife was right about that . " " Oh , I 'm the person that ought to have stuck by him , " I said . " I was his oldest friend . I ought to have taken him by the scruff of his neck and  --  only , how could you , with Tom ? But I hate to think of him going the way his father went . " Then we talked very wisely of heredity and environment and failure and success  --  we were both successes , and I 'm afraid we knew it . And as we buried Tom , we praised him , as old friends will . So it was a very decided shock when my secretary came in the next day with the news that a Mr. Thomas Allin wanted to see me . For one second I felt as if she had announced a ghost . And for a long moment , with the cowardice of middle age , I thought of what I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old , persistent drink and looking at the soiled cuffs on his shirt and giving him ten dollars . I would n't like warning Edie and telling the switchboard girl that I was out if a Mr. Allin called . I could take him out and feed him , but it was after three and the banks were closed . I wondered if there was cash enough in the office safe to buy a man a ticket to Sapepas  --  it was quite a long way . I 'd been going to the third night of Edie 's new play , but I 'd have to put him on the train instead ; if you did n't put them on the train , they turned back their tickets and phoned you later from bars . Still , it had to be got through with . I braced myself and told the secretary to show Mr. Allin in . He was balder than I , but he looked younger  --  that was the first thing that struck me . And the eyes had not aged at all . They were precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested . His clothes were not New York clothes , but he wore them with an air . There was no smell of drink and hisP185hands were tanned , steady , and healthy . Then I found myself shaking hands and clapping him on the back and opening my private box of cigars . He seemed genuinely pleased to see me , but not nearly so stirred as I. " Well , Old Persistence , " he said , with his light smile . Then he walked over and looked at a framed photograph on my wall . " The Nyanza locks , are n't they ? " he said .. . . " From the West Bank ? . . . Thought so . The greatest piece of engineering since the Panama Canal . ' Well , I 'm glad an American could do it . Remember when I told you you looked like a beaver ? " We sat up very late at Edie Foster 's house on the East River that night  --  we sat till the dawn came . I think we were all a little drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Allin . We revived our childhood , we told silly stories , we unpacked the load of the years . And always Tom Allin led us and drew us on . Only then  --  it must have been three o'clock and Edie had just finished the incredible , libelous , and excruciatingly funny story of her South American tour  --  she suddenly said , " Stop ! Yes , I want to hear about the Nyanza locks , Harry  --  you 've always frozen up when I tried to dig it out of you before . And I want to tell  --  oh , there 's everything I want to tell . But there 's something I want to know first , and it 's you , Tom Allin ! How are you , where are you , what are you doing , who are you ? " Her voice rang with its full stage timbre  --  the timbre that sends little waves through her audiences . " Oh , there 's nothing to say , " said Tom Allin . " Except that "  --  and he raised his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden and boyish grin  --  " I was a good picker , was n't I ? Yes , I 've been that . " " There was a proverb my father used to quote , " he said . " Unstable as water , thou shalt not excel . ' He meant it for me . " There were lines in his face for a moment and he looked much older ; then the lines smoothed back . " And he was right , " said Torn Allin . " And I knew it . I knew it from the time I was five . We moved quite a lot , you see , and I always did well at the new thing , for a while . Well , any child likes doing well . But the minute I did anything too long  --  " He shook his head . " And yet , people kept expecting things of me , " he said . " And that fools you sometimes . Especially if you 're a child and they 're older people  --  you feel they should know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out they 're eager to take you at face value if you 'll only let them , and it is n't hard to do . I do n't know just when it was that I first realized the truth . That I was  --  well , a pace-maker , if you want to call it that . That I was n't for the long pull . You thought I was joking , Harry , when we sat on the porch with John Cowenden and I said that what I wanted was a sinecure in a good climate . But I was n't . You see , I love life , " he said . Something burned in his eyes . " I love life , " he repeated in a lower voice . " Most people just love a part of it  --  you have to love a part of it more than anything else if you want to be a great man . But I never could . There was always something around the corner , something I had n't tried . And then , the people  --  good Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here and there ! I do n't think I ever really hurt anybody  --  except Lisa , perhaps . I feel badly about Lisa . " I thought of Mrs. Harley Dunn , her house , her position , her securities . They were secure then . They are still secure , though the house was bombed last fall . " You need n't , " I said . " I told you this afternoon . " " Yes , " he said . " You did n't see the drawing room ? I hope she used a good deal of crystal with the white . Oh , it 's not quite true what I 'm saying . You could n't help wanting to rescue her  --  not after you 'd seen her father and the house . ButP187at the back of my mind , I suppose I did mean to live on the Cowenden money . Only , when it came to the point in the end  --  well , I could n't . If there 'd been anything more to do  --  but there was n't . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His fingers had the unconscious gesture of a sculptorshaping clay . " And then  --  " I prompted . " Oh , then , " he said , and turned his clear eyes on the two of us . " Then I tried the other thing . I thought that might be really what I was meant for . " " Oh , you poor kid , " said Edith Edmands , on a deep note . " Was it very bad ? " " No . That was the bad thing , " said Tom Allin . " It did n't touch me really , even the drugs . They say the drugs will , but they did n't . I did n't like them enough . I was in a Belgian jail for a year  --  oh , quite roughly . Not my own name , no . But it was n't a pleasant jail . And that scared me . " I looked at him  --  it was impossible that he should have been in jail ; he bore no marks of it . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so many feet , according to the old wives ' talc . " No , " he said , " I do n't look like a jailbird . But it scared me . You see , there were other people there . And one clay I realized that I was organizing a prison break . And that scared me . It was n't a bad plan , " be said reflectively . " I'cl have to draw you a map of the prison to show you , but it could have worked . It could have worked , or they could have been shot by the guards . Stupid , pliable , ordinary small thieves and swindlers . And if they 'd been shot , I 'd have shot them . Just as if I 'd taken a machine gun . They thought I 'd sold them out , of course , when I stopped it . I never stopped anything before  --  it was hard to do . And it gave me a bad time afterward . But it taught me something . " He drew a long breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " They wanted me to go to an officers ' camp , in the war . " He laughed , with the only bitterness I 'd ever heard in his voice . " Can you see me leading troops  --  after the first days ? If there did n't happen to be a lucky bullet  --  No , I 've re-signed . " " I was asking you where , what , and why , " said Edith Edmandsstubbornly . " I think you 're ridiculous . How ought Ito take that speech with Gerald at the end of the first act ? " " If you took it about three beats slower , " said Tom Allin automatically , " and turned  --  let 's see  --  well , this is the fireplace  --  no , Ldic , hands like this  --  " " You sec ? " said Edith Edmands , turning to me . " And I pay a director  --  or Wallace pays him . We pay a director large sums . I do n't know what you 're doing , Tom Allin . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I merely said , " Fen dubs . We 're starting the Colorado job next month . I want somebody to handle people , on certain angles . I do n't care if he does n't know an I-beam from a fishplate . I 'll outbid you if I have to , Edie  --  the job 's worth it . " He looked at us both and said , " I ca n't thank you . But , Edie , how long would it be before I spent all my time teachingthe fellow who played the butler to play the perfect butler ? And , Harry , how long would it be before I found a young botanist in one of your work crews and wanted to make another Linnaeus out of him ? Now , there are two things I 've never worked at  --  botany and butling , " he said , and his eyes narrowed . " They must be interesting . Tennis , too  --  I 've never tried tennis . " And then , " he said , " you see , there 's Minna and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a little wrinkle came in his forehead . " Do n't tell me ! " he said . " I thought I had . But I was so glad to see you two again . We were marriedten years ago . We have three children  --  two girls and a boy.  |p189He  drew the picture from his wallet and we looked at it in silence  --  the picture of the plump , square matron in the bungalow apron , in front of the little house , and the three healthy , solid children , looking quite like Torn in a way , and yet not like Tom . The boy 's looks were the closest , and yet different . A sudden and very charming smile broke over Tom Allin 's face . " You see , " he said quite gently , " she does n't think I 'm remarkableor fascinating or born to be great . She thinks I 'm rather incapable , but she 's fond of me  --  Lord knows why . She knows I was married before , but she thinks it was somebody like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide to marry me , after she found I 'd been divorced . She does n't believe in divorce . When I came to New York this time , she warned me against playing cards with strangers on the bus . " " But what do you do ? " said Edie helplessly . " What do you do ? " " We run a gas station and restaurant , " said Tom Allin . " We 're well thought of in the town  --  it 's about as big as Sapepas  --  I wo n't tell you the name . Much the same kind of country , too  --  I like that kind of country , you know . The second year was the bad time  --  I wanted to sell out then , but Minna would n't have it . I 'm glad she would n't  --  they 're the two businesses where you 're always meeting people , but never see them long . Though we have a good , steady , regular trade . And every year Minna makes Inc take two weeks ' vacationby myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both know they are n't . Last year I went to New Orleans  --  there 's a painter down there you may hear of sometime  --  I just happened to run into him and we had some interesting talks . I 'm afraid I told him I was a research chemist  --  I always thought chemists must lead interesting lives . Still , a week is hardly enough to injure anybody . This year I came to New York to look up spiritualists and mediums . You 'd be sur- prised at the number of practicing ones there are . But they 're rather dull as a class  --  duller than I expected . And when I found that you both were here  --  well , I could n't miss seeing you , the last day . " He stopped and looked at us both . " It was my last chance , " he said . " Minna always expects me to bring her a present from my trips , though I 've never quite succeeded yet in getting just the present she wants . So tomorrow , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The childrenwo n't mind what I bring them . Not one of them , even the youngest , shows the slightest trace of precocity , thank God ! " All the same , he stayed with us till dawn . I 'd have seen him to his cheap hotel , but lie asked me not to . And there was nothing I could give him ; least of all , money . When he left me , he was the same , with his candid blue eyes unruffled ; and I noticed again that his face was younger than mine . And then , for a long while , I wondered if any of it was true . But I know now . For I picked up the paper the other day and read a long article on the sports page about the new prodigy in Middle Western tennis . Ned Marlow is only sixteen , but apparently he 'll burn up the tournaments when he comes East . The article mentioned the fact that he had n't started as a prodigy  --  in fact , a garage keeper in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while had taught him his first strokes . It did n't give his name , but it gave the name of the town . So I 'm wondering about something else now  --  about a boy named Allin . He must be pretty well grown , by now , and I wonder what Tom 's taught him . Maybe nothing  --  I would n't know . But he had Tom in his face , and yet there was a difference , a stability . I wonder what sound he listens for at night in the small town sunk in the wheat . P191THEY had been together a great many times , on a great many beaches , in a great many restaurants , looking out over the water . The restaurants had been called by various names in various languages ; they had had orchestras and dance bands and juke boxes and a little man who played a guitar and a girl who played an accordion . They had been full of sailors in berets and Futurist painters , also in berets , and women in evening dress and women with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coats and women also in tail coats , and men with their bare feet stuck in espadrilles . This one was called Mrs. Sims ' Clam House and , except for two tanned children solemnly eating strawberry ice cream at the counter , it was entirely empty when they came in . They moved to the small corner table overlooking the water and sat down . The table was supposed to scat four , but they pulled up the clean hard chairs and made it do for seven . They never minded things like that ; they had clone them many times . They were not particularly demanding ; they merely wanted the best , and the new place was always the best . After a while , it got spoiled and they left and found another place . They left while the crowds were still coming and before the receivers came . But only the local people and a few summer colonists yet came to Mrs. Sims ' Clam House , It was as new a place as that . " It 's frantic , " said Jinny Crick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compartment in the special handbag . " Look at the boats . It 's heavenly . Is n't it frantic ? " " It 's a nice little place , " said Beth Blake , in her rich voice . " We think it 's a nice little place . " She looked at the waitress . " Good evening , Pearl , " she said pleasantly . " Fish chowder , crab buns and the salad for all of us . " She smiled . " I wo n't let them have anything else , " she said , " even if they cry and scream for it . They must n't have another thing . " " Well , that 's all right , I guess , Mrs. Blake , " said the waitressin a small , indomitable voice . " Tea , coffee or milk ? " " Black coffee , very hot , in very thick china cups , " said the small man unexpectedly and deeply . His name was Harry Crandall and , though he had flown from the Coast two days before , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " But they must be thick china  --  dinner china , " he added anxiously , peering at the waitress . " I guess we got them thick enough , if that 's what you want , " said the waitress . " Splendid , " said Harry Crandall . " And that is just what I want . " He looked around the small new place . " Thank God , there are n't any curtains , " he said . " I was afraid of redcheckedones . And matches that look like little sailors . But it is n't . No offense meant to the Navy , " he added to the blond young man in ensign 's uniform on the other side of Jinny Crick , " but I just do n't happen to like matches that look like little sailors . " " You want some matches ? " said the waitress . " No , thank you , " said Harry Crandall abstractedly , " I want no matches . I match no want ads . I just keep rolling along . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Jinny Crick . " Did you see Jimmy and Mike ? " " No , " said Harry Crandall . " Jimmy 's in the Signal Corps . And Mike was out at Palm Springs , rewriting the story line for Little Dorrit . It 's going to be Colossal 's new contributionp193to Anglo-American friendship . They 've changed it a little , of course . Little Dorrit is a waif brought up in the Romney Marsh and she takes a fishing trawler over to Dunkirk . If you can believe Mike over the telephone . As a matter of fact , it will probably turn out to be a good picture . Mike has a knack . " " A knack and a promise , " said Beth Blake . " A knack in his engine . How 's the newest bride ? " " She 's the best society of Cedarhurst , " said Harry Crandall . " But I like Mike . I always did . " " We all love Mike , " said Jinny Crick . " It 's just the brides and the clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him he had on a shirt with pores in it . But I suppose that 's the Coast . " The ensign , who had been trying to follow these remarks , turning his head politely toward each speaker in turn , now addressedHarry Crandall . " Were you out there making a picture yourself , sir ? " he said respectfully . " No , " said Harry Crandall . " This was a radio show . Propaganda . " He bit off the word . " It must have been very good stuff , sir , " said the ensign , again respectfully , and attacked his chowder . The red-haired girl sitting opposite him tried to smile at him , but could not catch his eye . Poor Tom  --  it was all her fault and she had let him in for it . But his train went at q : 38 and there would n't be much longer now . All the same , she was glad that he had seen these people , and seen them as they were . It would make . things so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always hard to explain . She sat in a little pool of silence , quite contented to be op posite Tom , while around her the swift talk flowed  --  the casual conversation , full of names and jokes , jumping gaps to the next new thing  --  the patter and the lingo . She had been brought up on it , she had been brought up on them all . It went back to French sands and the rocking sleep on trains and liners , and all the wonderful people coming in through the garden for cocktails , sitting out on the terrace and talking , coming up the stairs to the studio and making a pleasant noise  --  Aunt Beth and Uncle Charlie and the nice man they all called Monkey and all the others . At one time , many years ago  --  nearly five years ago , when she was only fif teen  --  she had thought them the most wonderful people in the world . Then Mummy and Daddy had finally broken up and , since then , she had been away a great deal at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't really seen very much of them , though she had dutifully read their books and seen their plays and their paintings and their pictures in magazines  --  even boasted of them , now and then , at new schools , when you had to boast of something . And they had remembered birthdays and graduations and vacations  --  remembered them with thoughtful and difficult presents and telegrams from California and offers of trips and week ends that she 'd stopped accepting , once she began to build her life for herself . And all of that had been genuine , and she granted it . But it was n't her kind of life any more at all . She glanced around the table , seeing them with the hard clear eyes of youth . It was hard to grow up and see them as they were , and yet it had to be done . Aunt Beth and Uncle Charlie ; Sid Vining , the stage designer ; Harry Crandall , the writer ; Jinny Crick , who was always there because she was always there . They looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they were the generation that had made the trouble , and you could n't forget about that . They had got the world in a mess , and it was her generation and Tom 's that would have to straighten it out . They had got the world in a mess  --  they and wonderful people like them . They had shouted for peace and disarmament , they had shouted of theP195horrors of war , then they had turned around and shouted for war . They drank too much , they divorced too easily , they lived by a code of their own ; there was no health in them . So they ought to behave as if there were no health in them . And yet , even now , they did n't behave that way  --  and that was the irritating fact . They were eating , instead , with the serious and absorbed attention they always gave to good food . " Do n't tell me that 's saffron , " said Sid Vining , " because I would n't believe you . But it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Weymouth . All the way from Weymouth , " said Beth Blake . " It could be a mint , you know , " said Sid Vining earnestly , " with the food as good as this . Remember the place at St. Tropez ? " " They did n't ration gas at St. Tropez , " said Jinny Crick . . . . " That 's a song title , is n't it , ensign ? " " I guess it really is , " said Torn Finlay , smiling pleasantly . The red-haired girl felt a sudden desire to touch him , to reassure herself of his solid reality . For Sid Vining was talkingnow of the things that could be done with Mrs. Sims ' Clam House and , as the others threw in their quick , light comments , the little place changed and grew . Quietly but inexorably it grew , and the large cars slid up to the dock and the chattering people flooded in  --  the tanned men in white dinner jackets , the pleasantly scented women who threw their little fur wraps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on stools at the bar and thought it was quaint and darling . It grew , as places always grew when the wonderful people came and until they left . She wanted to pound on the table and say , " Stop it ! Stop it ! " But Harry Crandall caught her eye and smiled . " What 's the matter ? " he said . " It is n't going to happen , you know . It could n't any more . "   " You would n't understand , " she said . " The boats out there are real boats and they catch real fish . It is n't just a  --  a stage set for  --  " " For people like us ? " he said . " No , the point is well taken . It is n't a stage set any more . " " I guess I 'm being rude , " said the girl . " I guess maybe I am . But what was the Hotel du Cap like , at Antibes , the last time you saw it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crandall , and shrugged . " Well , they had to  --  I wish they 'd quarteredmore . But it was nice out on the rocks  --  you must remember . " " I remember all right , " said the girl . " I remember those fine old clays and the screaming parties and the Russian woman who jumped out of the window . I was n't particularly old , but I remember . " " You 're lucky , " said Harry Crandall , " even with that . I did n't get over till I was in the Army . " " If you want the child 's point of view  --  well , it was n't much fun , " said the girl . " We all wanted ice-cream sodas and Americanclothes and movies that were n't months late . We wanted the funnies and games like the ones we read about , and not to be foreign . " " That 's interesting , " said Harry Crandall . " Yes , I see how that could be . " The girl stared at him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  they were always so open-minded . They 'd attack you for a taste , demolish you for a judgment , but not for an opinion , particularly when it was critical of them . " I suppose that 's why I used to be an isolationist , " she said . " It hurt Mummy and Daddy . They could n't understand it . " " Perfectly natural reaction , " said Harry Crandall .   " But how can you say that ? " said the girl . " Ever since t he war first broke out , you  --  " He looked at her , and his face was empty and sad . " After the last war , " he said , " the one thing I swore I 'd never write was propaganda . But this one is for our skins , and the chips are down . " He smiled at her . " So no explanations or apologies , " he said . " Have some coffee . It 's good . " She tried to read the pleasant , lined , empty face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew that when she looked at Tom . And yet the eyes were as alive as a prodigal child 's . But the prodigal children were finished . " And speaking of blackouts , Beth , " said Charles Blake , " as we were n't . " " Yes , we should , " said Beth Blake , and again , like migratorybirds , they collected themselves and began to make gesturesof departure . It took a little time , but it was efficient and smooth . They said goodbye , carefully and politely , to Pearl , to Mrs. Sims , to the man at the counter . They looked into the kitchen for a moment , they walked out on the dock and looked at the sunset . It was obvious to the red-haired girl that they should lower their voices on the dock and be less themselves than they were , but they did nothing of the sort . It was obvious that the other people on the dock should hate them , but that did not seem to happen either . When , at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the girl gave a sigh of relief . " Let 's drive back by the Point , Tom , " she said . " It 's only half a mile farther and we need n't be back right away . " " Well , they 're very interesting people , " said Tom a little later . " They certainly give you something to think about . " He laughed a little nervously . " Was I all right , darling ? " he said .   " You were fine , " said the girl . " Just fine . And you do n't have to be polite . " " Well , they were polite to me , " said Tom , and she saw the stubborn line of his jaw . " , They always are while you 're with them , " said the girl . " Oh , do n't let 's quarrel , " she said . " I was n't quarreling , beautiful , " said Tom , and they both stared out over the darkening water . He was there and solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should be talkinga great deal and they were not talking at all . The wonderfulpeople had spoiled it. " 011 , damn them ! " she said with sudden violence . " Damn them from hell to breakfast ! Damn them all ! " " Why , honey , " he said . " Why , honey , what 's the matter ? " Then his arms were around her and she should have felt safe and secure . But there was neither safety nor security anywhere any more . The wonderful people had seen to that long ago , when they first set a match to the world . " Oh , it 's all right , " she said . " It 's all right , Tom . But we 've got to get to your train . " When she returned to the house the blackout shades were already drawn and the highball tray was waiting . Beth Blake was explaining about the blackout shades . " It 's just dim-out , really , " she was saying , " but we thought we 'd do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gestured at the gay , bright flower patterns on the inside of the shades . " Jimmy Bender thought they ought to be much more Dali , " she said . " He said he 'd do them over , but I do n't think Dali 's very cozy for a blackout . I 'd hate to look at eyes and watches while I was being bombed . So we just made them prettypretty , and now Charlie says it 's like living inside a seed catalogue . " Her rich laugh rang . She turned to the red-haired girl . " I hope your young man got a seat on the train , " shep199said . " They 're so tiresomely crowded now , especially on week ends . " " Oh , he got one all right , " said the red-haired girl ... . " No , thanks , Uncle Charlie , not a drink right now ; I just want to powder my nose . " And there goes a very nice youngster who 's just seen a ghost , thought Harry Crandall , watching her stride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach . Were we as hard to reach as that ? Well , yes , I suppose we were . He removed himself unobtrusively from the group and sat quietly in a corner , listening to the phonograph , his highball on one knee . Charlie Blake was playing a new calypso  --  be always found them , somehow . " Telling you about the Battle of Midway when those Japaneseships went down , " went the strange , effective voice . " Telling you about the Battle of Midway when the U. S. Navy fleet went to town  --  " Harry Crandall listened , glad for the fact of noise . He 'd talk , if he had to , in a minute , but right now he did n't want to talk , even to Charlie or Beth . And Charlie and Beth would n't mind ; they had been together long enough . He tried to remember when he had first met the Makes  --  ' 21 ? ' 22 ? But it was hard to remember when you were tired . He 'd met them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Mimi Post , who would n't get out of her sanitariumnow , and a lot of the old crowd . But it had been a new crowd then  --  quite new and shiny . In the clays of the Dome and the Rotonde and Marta 's down in the Village and the start of many things ; the days of the fierce bursts of work and the quick trips on liners ; the days when Paris was Mecca and there would n't be any more wars . Yes , a new crowd  --  quite new and shiny . And everybody had been poor at the start , except the Blakes . But nobody minded the Blakes ' not being poor.  | Well , he thought , we 've had a good run for it , money or no money . We 've had what wo n't be again  --  the food and the talk and the wine . But France fell , dammit  --  France fell . She could n't fall , but she did . And that handsome youngster probablythinks it happened because they liked good food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to preserve . Not all , but part . He looked around the room at the good faces  --  the faces of his friends . They had been together so often and so long and through so many happenings . The work was a different thing , that , in time , could be assessed . Not such bad work either , on the whole , though no doubt it could have been better . But he was thinking of the people , not the work . For nobodywas going to be able to put in a book what Charlie Blake was like twenty years ago or why Jinny Crick , for all her manneredfolly , had both charm and heart . It could n't be put in a book or explained to the young . But these are my friends , my colleagues , my generation  --  the people I have chosen to live and die beside . And we went on a queer adventure  --  very queer when you come to think of it , for it brought us back precisely , and in twenty years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must fight for those , if anything good is to live . And after that , we 'll be old . But we 've seen some things . He noticed that the red-haired girl was back in the room again , on a sofa beside Sid Vining . Well , here goes for a rescue , he thought . She wo n't get on with Sid  --  not in whatevermood she 's in , and Sid 's pretty much on edge himself . He approached them amiably . " Nice drinks ? Nice picture post cards , gentleman and lady ? " he said . " Nice guide for the conducted tour ? " " Do n't give her a drink , " said Sid Vining sourly . " She thinks it 's the Demon Rum . " He rose and bowed . " I have been rebuked by infants , " he said . " I shall go get myself stinking in comparative peace . " He stalked away.  | " Well , " said Harry Crandall , and sat down . The girl said nothing . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In case you wanted information . " " Who cares if he does ? " said the girl in a low fierce voice . Harry Crandall considered this . " Oh , some of us , in a way , " he said . " It is n't particularly good for his work . And he 's about the best scene designer we 've got . But he 's been mostly on the wagon for quite a while now . " " Then why does n't he do something , " said the girl , " instead of talking about putting little bars in restaurants ? Why does n't he do camouflage ? " He stared at her and laughed . " Poor Sid , " he said . " He 's got a trick knee . And bad eyes . The Army 's turned him down twice . Now he thinks they may take him , but he is n't sure . So he 's a little touchy . " " Ch , " said the girl . " Yes , " said Harry Crandall . " And now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had a white face all evening , and I do n't like girls with white faces . Also , I need one myself . You get tired on planes ; it 's the monotony , I guess . " He mixed two drinks expertly , thinking , Harry Crandall , the rescuer , Harry Crandall , the lifeguard . Are n't you proud of yourself , Mr. Harry Fix-it Crandall ? But howdy and Ella Martinson were friends of yours , and swell people , so the least you can do is to get their daughter a drink at a party . That will help so much . When he brought them back , the girl looked at hers doubtfully . " I do n't really like it , " she said . " I am not attempting to inebriate you , " said Harry Crandallpatiently ; " I am recommending for shock . And do n't tell me you have n't had one . " " I have n't , " said the girl , but she sipped at the very light highball.  | " Of course not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You drink milk and cokes and grow to be six-footthree . Which is perfectly fine , and I 'm for it . But nobody 's shock-proof these days . Nobody at all . " " It was n't anything at all , " said the girl , but the color began to come back to her white face . " Of course it was n't anything , " said Harry Crandall . " It was just driving back through the blackout , " said the girl . " I mean , it takes quite a long time . I  --  I did n't realize it would take so long . It was spooky , " she said , with hurt . " That so ? " said Harry Crandall . " Yes , that must make tough driving . " He did not say , In the last war , I remember the first time we moved with lights , after the Armistice . I remember that because it hit you right in the face ; it scared you for a minute . And I remember how London looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those things . " And then I came back , " said the girl , " and I 'd just seen Tom off , and Aunt Beth was talking about blackout shades and being silly , and I went upstairs to powder my nose in her bedroom , and she 's got a very bright tin pail full of very white sand , and I guess it matches the bedroom , and  --  oh ! " " Nobody will notice it if you cry , " said Harry Crandall . " Or we could go out in the kitchen . People often do . " " I 'm not going to cry ! " said the girl . " But it suddenly got rather horrible . And Aunt Jinny  --  Mrs. Crick  --  was in the bedroom . She was sitting there in a chair and she was crying . But she was n't making any sound  --  just the tears coming out of her eyes . And I stood there like a fool and did n't know what to do ! " Her voice rose sharply . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You see , Jinny has a boy in the coastal patrol . You played with him once , but you probably would n't remember him  --  his name 's Sam Langley and he 's even taller than you are.  |p203Red  hair too , " he said reflectively . " Well , you see how that might worry her . And then Toby Crick 's in London for lendlease , and she 's rather fond of Toby . " " If you 're trying to make me feel like even more of a heel , you 're succeeding very nicely , " said the girl . " Oh , no , " said Harry Crandall . " No . I 'm not claiming the higher maternal virtues for Jinny  --  in fact , I 'd hate to be mothered by her myself . But I 'd hate not to have her around , with her silly square make-up box , making up her silly face and worrying about it . You get to be that way about people after a while . And it 's been a long while . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought with your young man , " he said . " I did n't fight with him , " said the girl . " It was just  --  it was going to be wonderful  --  and then , suddenly , it did n't mean anything . " " You ca n't go entirely by one week end , " said Harry Crandall , remarking that the girl 's color had now returned to normal . And , Old Mother Hubbard , how did you pull that wellwornadvice right out of the hat ? he thought . " You do n't understand , " said the girl . " You could n't possibly ! It 's got to be right for me  --  after Mummy and Daddy and the way they broke up ! It 's got to be safe and secure ! Something 's got to be ! And I thought Tom was , and I was counting on that . I thought not even Aunt Beth and the rest of you could spoil him . And then  --  " " And then , " said Harry Crandall , " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't what you did , " said the girl . " You never do . But you made him look dull and ordinary , and he was respectful to you  --  so horribly respectful . " " In other words , " said Harry Crandall , " he was polite . " He cleared his throat . I wish I could remember more about that young man , he thought . He was perfectly all right and I liked him , but I never could pick him out in a parade . " And as for his being dull , " he said guardedly , " I thought he had some pretty solid ideas . " " Yes , that 's Toni , " said the girl eagerly . She pulled her handkerchief from her handbag and firmly blew her nose . " And they 're real ideas too . He thinks there are going to be a lot of changes after the war and we 'll all have to be more responsible . " " That 's an interesting point of view , " said Harry Crandall . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought . This Tom may be all she thinks , but he ought to have more competition . And the first time you fall in love you 're always so sure it 's for keeps . He cocked his ear to what the girl was saying now . " But I ca n't get over being so scared , " she said like a child . " Why was I ? " " There 's a war on , " said Harry Crandall , " and a big one . And you can forget for a while , just the way you can almost go to sleep on a march . But now and then it comes over you , like a wave . It is n't a question of courage and it does n't affect your doing things . You drove the car back all right , did n't you ? You did n't drive it into a ditch ? Well , that 's all you have to know . " " Yes , that 's so , " she said gratefully . " I did n't drive it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Harry Crandall . " Because there was a big car and it got in the ditch . And now we 've got to get it out . Not just your generation or mine , " he said carefully , " but all of us . That 's the difference . Do you hate us all very much ? You might , you know . After all , we did have the parties . " " I do n't know , " said the girl . " I do n't know . " " As for me , I 'm entirely vulnerable , " said Harry Crandall . " This is Charlie 's last leave and Beth 's going to shutp205the house . But I 'm everything you think . I 'm a nasty little civilian propagandist , and will the new crowd make hay of that , in ten years ' time , when it 's all over ! Remember the fearsome tripe the established names  --  or most of them  --  wrote about the last one , and how it retched the bowels of my generation ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But somebody had to do it . " He spoke without heat or pride . " I do n't understand you , " said the girl . " I do n't understandany of you . I do n't know that I want to . " " It does n't matter a bit , " said Harry Crandall . " Only maybe you 'd better . If you 're going to make a new world  --  and I gather you are . " He looked at her , glad to see her so stiff and uncompromising . " Well , we were , too , " he said . " And it was n't a bad one . It had freedom and pleasure and good food and truthful art . But we had to make our own rules and we could n't see around the next curve . So that 's that , and what happened happened . " He stared at his drink . " And you 'll do it very differently , " he said . " I should hope so , " said the girl . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember that freedom means freedom , not bossing other people  --  and your friends , in the end , are your friends . With which profoundremark , " he said , " your cracker-barrel philosopher will now sign off . " He finished his drink and stood up . " Let 's go outside fora minute , " he said . " Charlie 's got a perfectly devilishblackout arrangement on the terrace door , but I think I know my way through it . " When they were outside in the cool darkness , the girl took a deep breath . " It smells nice , " she said . " It smells good . Even in wars . " " Yes , " said Harry Crandall gently . " You 'll sleep , of course ? " he said . " Why , of course I 'll sleep , " said the girl . " Why should n't I ? "  | He chucklod faintly to himself . " No reason , " he said . But you 're over your jitters , he thought , and you wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby and wake , and tomorrowyou 'll write to Tom , or he 'll write to you . And you 'll marry him or somebody , but it wo n't be me , thank goodness , for I 've chosen the friends I must live and die beside . And we 're getting on , every one of us , but we 've got about one more kick in us , and those that are left are tough . No , we wo n't be easy in your Zion . But we 'll try to behave . We 're trying . " Born and bred in the brier patch , Br'er Fox , " he said , half to himself . " Born and bred in the brier patch , and now we 're back there again . But we did take life with both hands ; we were n't cautious about it . And that 's still something to do . " But the girl was still standing there , breathing in the night , a tall , confident figure beneath the calm sky that sometime might hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the house and his friends . P207Now sit down , dear , and take off your hat . I 'm not a bit tired and we 'll have a nice long visit . The doctor said , " Well , Mrs. Blake , I 'm not going to tell you not to give luncheon parties . But just remember there is such a thing as Anno Domini . " And I do , of course . Or , if I do n't , Carrie reminds me . But the queer thing is that I do n't feel old . I know I 'm eighty when I think about it , but sometimes , when I lie in bed in the morning , before Carrie brings me my breakfast , I feel just as young as I ever did and I wonder why I ca n't get up and run out into the garden like a little girl . That 's a foolish way for an old woman to feel  --  now , is n't it ? You need n't raise your voice , dear  --  I 'm not deaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . I ca n't explain to you just how that happens , but it does . It 's like seeing a road you 've climbed from the top of a bill , all the curves and windings  --  and some parts of it arc very plain and sonic parts are blurred . Your Aunt Florence sent me a silly book the other day  --  I should n't say it was silly , because it was kind of her to send it , but it was . ' ' he woman iii it was only sixtyfive , but she cried a great deal and kept seeing her twin sister , though the poor little thing had died of cholera years before . Well , of course , these things sometimes happen , but much more often in books , dear . If I shut my eyes I can see my mother in her lavender dress , and your grandfather coming back from market with a fine fresh shad in brown paper , or a basket of fresh strawberries with big green leaves at the bottom . But that is n't seeing ghosts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd like to . And I 'm sure your grandfather would n't approve of being a ghost  --  he was a very particularman and he loved his own way . But he 'd walk home , just the same , with the market basket over his arm , when he felt like it . There were patients who did n't like it , but he paid no attention . I remember his saying to one of them , who was always complaining , " Madam , you have been granted three great blessings  --  a good husband , an excellent liver , and a republicanform of government . If you can not accommodate yourself to life with these , I have very little hope of you , either here or in the hereafter . " She was very angry and flounced out  --  but of course , when she felt sick , she sent for him again . I wish you could have known him  --  he died before you were born . He wore a top hat till he died  --  a stovepipe , we called it in those days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old ones away . It used to vex him , but she was quite firm about it . " Flora , " he 'd say , " Flora , my dear , what the devil has happened to my hat ? Do n't tell me you 've given it away to one of your infernal beggars . " Then she 'd say , " Well , Henry , he seemed such a deserving man , but I 've gotten you a beautiful new one from Mr. Vincey . " " I do n't want a beautiful new hat , Flora  --  I want my hat ! " Of course he always gave in , in the end  --  she knew that he would . He would carry his stethoscope in them and it made a bulge on one side . It got to be quite a joke eventually  --  I remember Mrs. Thurston 's saying , " Why , of course I had the man cut the grass  --  he had one of the doctor 's hats on , so I knew he must be respectable . " She lived on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though it was such a nice street then . P209I can see the whole Larch Street house , too , just as plain as plain , and the lilac bush in the yard . How sweetly it smelled ! I can see my mother 's work basket , and the carpet with the big , soft flowers . But that does n't mean I 'm seeing ghosts either . The person who wrote that book did n't seem to understand that  --  it must have been a clever young man . I thought I 'd write a letter and give him a piece of my mind , but Carrie dissuaded me and Carrie 's usually right . After all , why would he like to hear from an old woman ? But they make old women such bags of bones , in their books . Oh , I know what I look like now . But they never tell that you might have had pretty hands . I was never really vain of mine , but your father admired them . And I must say , I had a good carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she did n't have shoulders like mine . I remember that silly old general  --  General Cranston . I was singing at the piano and he was turning my music and before I knew , he had leaned over and bitten me on the right shoulder . Not hard , dear , but perceptible and difficult to explain . Then he said : " I apologize , Miss Sophy , but it was just like biting into a peach . " Well , I was only sixteen but I drew myself up and said , " You have taken a very great liberty , General Cranston . I think you had better leave the house , " and he bowed and left without saying another word . Then I ran to my room and cried all afternoon because I was afraid , after that , he might ask to marry me and I 'd have to . You would n't think your mother could be such a jay ! But I must say , he behaved himselfafterward , though I could n't bear your Uncle Robert 's calling him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , years later , he only laughed and teased me . Well , I 'd never have married a man who dyed his whiskers , so I suppose your father was right . There are so many things I want to tell you and the children . I keep thinking about them and then , of course , I forget . It might n't mean much to them now , but sometime it might . They 're just little things  --  they happen in every family . But if nobody cares , they get lost . A family 's like a country  --  it takes so much living and dying to make it . Then the children go off and do new things , and that 's quite right . But something stays . That 's why I sent your Ellen the little scent bottle . It 's very old-fashioned , of course  --  she may not have any use for it . But it was Great-Grandma 's  --  it came from Shamrock Hill . ' 1 here were only twenty houses in Pittsburgh , besides the fort , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . He came over the mountains with his pack horses , and Great-Grandma had to pin up her long skirts with thorns . I was only a little thing when I heard her tell about it . She had a great deal of spirit and she used to brush her hair two hundred strokes every night . It fell below her waist when she took the pins out , even when she was old . It must have been a wild , rough life for her at the beginning . She 'd been brought up like a doll till she married GreatGrandpa  --  became from the County Tyrone  --  and she cried when the little red trunk with her wedding dress in it was lost at the ford . She could always remember it floating away downstream , but there was n't time to stop . The men had heard there was a Wyandot war party , cutting off travelers . But when they found the poor scalped man , still living , beside the trace , she made them put him on her horse and tore up her petticoats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lived to be quite an old man ? They did , sometimes . When he was well enough , she made him a wig out of tow  --  I 've often heard her describe it . It must have looked queer enough ,  |p211but  he said it suited him better than his own hair because , if anyone tried to scalp him again , he said , they 'd find it was all done for them , and what more could be asked for ? He got a real wig , later on , but he always kept the tow one . Charlie O'Grady . His daughter married one of the Northrups  --  thesteel family . I believe they live on Long Island . I wonder if they 've kept the tow wig . It ca n't have been just what Great-Grandma expected when she married  --  to end her wedding journey in a log hut , at the end of nowhere , with a scalped man to care for as well as her own husband . But when people have to do things , they do them . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shamrock Hill on the high ground . He 'd made a great deal of money then , for the time  --  people used to say that he had a lucky hand . But it all went after he died  --  the boys were thoughtless and careless , except for your Great-Uncle Willie , and he died very young , at Natchez , of the fever . Great-Grandma never forgot that  --  he 'd been her favorite child . She carried his hair in her locket  --  a little child 's curl of pale , soft gold . But it was the girls who held the family together and took care of her  --  it happens so often . Well , money is n't everything and I do n't suppose we were meant to keep it . She was n't a businesswoman and the trustee robbed her  --  I believe they 're very wealthy people now . But your father used to say , " Yon can see what the Lord thinks of money by the people Tic gives it to . " And I do n't envy them . I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't the money there . It was all the aunts and cousins and friends and relations and their beaus and suitors and the childrenrunning up and down the wide stairs . They 'd sit down twenty at table , with another table for the children , and 2 Tstrangers were always welcome . They had the rosewood piano brought over the mountains  --  they had barrels of oysters shipped from the Chesapeake ; there was always the fruit and the game and the big loaves of sugar in their blue paper , the cream rising , thick and yellow , on the pans in the dairy , and Dutch Anna baking twenty cinnamon buns at a time . Well , they were open-handed people  --  and , of course , it helped to ruin them  --  but no one ever went away hungry from ShamrockHill . And the visitors  --  the visitors ! There was a cousin and his wife from Virginia  --  they came for a two months ' visit and , my clear , they stayed a year and a half and had a dear little baby too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went ; they moved away ; there was so much life there , so much life going on . Then it was all put up at auction . My mother remembered that and Great-Grandma at the auction , dressed in her black silk dress , receiving the people as if they were still her guests . She did n't cry one tear  --  it was the girls who cried . There 's a look of her in your Ellen  --  a certain look . The girls worked , sewing and dress-making and working for the women 's exchange , and mother taught school . That 's how she met your grandfather  --  he had n't a friend in the world , poor boy , for the uncle who brought him over here had died right after he came . They 'd meant to take up a farm , but there was some swindle about the papers . So he went to work in a livery stable  --  a boy of fifteen  --  and the man let him sleep in an empty feed bin , but he 'd lock him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And once he woke up , in the moonlight , and there was a big rat sleeping on his chest . But he opened his eyes and thought , " Well , brother rat , it 's a cold night for both of us. - But as long as you keep me warm and behave yourself , I do n't mind keeping you warm , in this queer foreign country , " and he went top213sleep again . He always liked to tell that story , though mother did n't like it . They called him Dutchy , at first , and made fun of his clothes and his ways  --  it must have been hard on a boy . Then the livery stable changed hands and he lost his job , and there was a time he did n't like to talk about , before he met Doctor Gray . That was the last house he tried  --  he 'd always been interested in medicine . " I went there with my pockets full of stones , " he said to mother once . " I thought , if this man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the river together . " Then he laughed and said : " But all the time I knew I could swim like a fish , stones or no stones . " But there was something about him that Doctor Gray liked and he let him take care of his horse . " Then , " your grandfather said , " the first time I saw him with a lancet in his hand  --  well , it was a very small affair , but I knew from then what I wanted to do . " Of course , when Mother met him , he was a young doctor in his first top hat . He spoke beautiful English , even then , but he wanted to improve it , and they read the British poets togetherthat winter and were married in the spring . I used to have the little copy of pope lie gave her : " ' 1'o Miss Flora Shand with the respectful good wishes of her friend , I lcndrik Schouten . " But those books were burned in the fire . There are so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish I could tell you . There was the way people lived and the things they said . It would n't mean much to strangers  --  oh , I know that ! But I do n't think it could have happened anywhere else  --  in any other country . I do n't think it could . I 'd like the children to know that . Though just as interesting things happen nowadays . Well , the people who came in the Mayflower were free people too . No matter how some of them turned out . And I 'm sure I do n't grudge them . But it seems to me , it 's al- ways been a Mayflower , for all the people who came . Though naturally , as Ransom would say , the first ones got the publicity . If you just live along , they do n't write books about you . And yet there must be so many of us , all over the nation . Your father used to say , " Well , there 's one thing about the family . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a horse thief  --  at least as far as I know . Well , of course , there was your Cousin Myron . " Not hanged , dear , no . But he always was such a responsibility . We never knew quite how it happened and he 'd been such a dear little boy , though spoiled . He got into bad company , but I 'm afraid it was his own fault too . Your father went to see him , out iu that place , and took up the pardon with the governor . I shall always respect your father for doing that  --  after all , Myron was my relative , not his . Sometimes it 's harder for a man to do those things  --  a woman would n't mind as much . I 've had your father say to me , " Really , Sophy , for someone who 's married to a lawyer , I think you have less respect for the law than anyone I know . " Well , now , that was n't quite just . It was only that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little boy in a white suit . They let him work in the prison library  --  he 'd always been fond of books and your father said he did it very well . Then afterward , I 'm glad to say , he married a nice , plain woman and they went to live in Florida . It was lemons first and then pecans , but his son made a go of it and belongs to the Chamber of Commerce . Your father saw him on one of his trips and said it was perfectly all right . He said the boy looked like Myron , but he 'd left his watch out on the table and nothing had happened to it . I think that was one of the few really unkind things your father ever said . Poor Myron ! He did so want to be popular with the other boys  --  and when he took six of them to the circus , it was your grandmother'sp215purse . I could have told them not to trust him with money ! But it 's all over now and the son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters and I hope I can see them sometime . It works out in a very queer way , often , but it does work out . At least , that 's what I 've come to believe . There 's a sort of rough justice . Now , your Grandmother Blake  --  she was a very fine woman . I always respected her and I think she came to respect me in the end . But your father and I were young when we married  --  and he was her favorite . It 's a difficultrelation , dear  --  you 'll see , when young Henry marries  --  and I hope you 'll be more sensible than I was . Why did I want to hold on to you all so closely ? And yet , I let you go when you wanted to go . We were visiting your Grandmother Blake once , and she said something to me  --  I wo n't tell you what it was , but I went upstairs to pack . I said I would n't stay in the house , and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was devoted to you . It must have been very hard for her to apologize to me , but Grandfather Blake made her do it . I did n't know what that meant to her at the time  --  I was too young and too stubborn  --  butI did later , with Bertha . Bertha used to say things that would cut me to the heart  --  but- Bertha was Ransom 's choice and she 's made him a good wife . I wish she would n't smoke so much  --  just like a chimney  --  but that 's none of my business . When the crash came in 1929 , she stood by him  --  and it worried me so terribly . There was n't a thing I could do but take the children for the summer  --  and I knew that Ransomwas drinking , though I never talked to Bertha about it . My son , my fine son ! Well , thank God , that 's all over and done with and they got back their home . But she came to me once and talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day , how many cigarettesshe smoked . She said , " Mother Blake , I love Ransom , but I guess we 're about washed up . And I 'm so tired , I do n't care  --  I do n't care what happens . " And I said , " Bertha , I know I 've made mistakes . I know you think I wanted him to marry Sally Forbes . But if I did , I was wrong . I 'm not asking you to stay with my son  --  I 'm asking you to do your best for your husband . If you ca n't , you ca n't , and I wo n't blame you , but I hope you can . Now I think we ought to have a cocktail  --  I feel tired . " So I made her mix one for both of us , though I 've never liked them , and she said , " O.K. , Mother Blake , " and I knew things were going to be better . Only then Ransom came in and was very angry with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a job all day and then , when he came home tired , Bertha was over drinking cocktails with me . In fact , he practically accused me of thinking more of Bertha than I did of him , and he talked about the cocktails till you 'd have thought I drank them for breakfast . And then , in the middle of what he was saying , it suddenly struck him as funny and he wiped his face with a handkerchief and said , so seriously , " I apologize , I 'm sure , ladies , " and we all began to laugh . Well , it was all very silly , but things began to go better for them after that . I do n't think Ransom even remembers it now  --  but I do , and I 'm sure that Bertha does . He 's done very well with the company , and they 're both so fond of the little grandchild . I wish Bertha Junior would n't call him " Butch "  --  that does n't seem right for a baby , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to complain about that , though . Bertha . Junior and Frank came over for Sunday-night supper a weekp217ago  --  they were asking me what I remembered and I think Frank was being polite . But they seemed quite interested , though I know that I talked too much . I was telling them about Great-Uncle Jim  --  my young uncle  --  coming back to the Larch Street house in his blue uniform at the end of the Civil ' War . I could n't have been more than five but I remember him , because he tossed me up to the ceiling . He used to sing a song too : " I 'm a snolleygoster and we 'll all jine the Union ! " And I learned the tune and copied him , though I did n't know what a snolleygoster was . And then there was something very sad and , everywhereyou went , the houses were hung with black and bells weretolling and tolling . That was Lincoln 's death . I was n't oldenough to know what it really meant , and yet I did know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if part of the sky I had fallen . And yet we went on . We did n't do as well as we 'd have done if he 'd been alive  --  and yet we went on . My brother John heard him speak  --  he was ten years older than I. He said he was a plain-looking man , but the minute you saw him you knew that he was a good man . We 've had so many good men . We 've had bad ones , too , and cruel ones , but we 've had good men . We 've made so many mistakes , but we 've done some good things too . I think sometimes we forget about the good things  --  the ordinary things we 're so used to. boy again and we met such interesting people . And yet , I was glad to get home . I could have stayed there for years , When your father and I went to Europe , it was such a wonderful trip . I was so glad to sec all the things I 'd read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all . I think about them all sometimes , at night  --  the Tower of London and Gray 's Inn and the Sainte-Chapelle and the nice , hot dinner we had on the boat train to Paris . Your father was just like aI but I was glad to get home . When I saw the Statue of Liberty , I could have cried , like an old fool . Your father said , " Now , Sophy , save your tears for the customs inspectors  --  you 'll probably need them . " But I noticed he was glad to get back and sit in his own chair . There was a very nice man at Mrs. Banks ' , the other day . He 'd traveled a great deal and he was very interesting . But I kept thinking all the time , " Well , I 've traveled too . " And I have , though it would n't have interested him  --  he 'd been to Egypt and Arabia . But when I went West with your father , there were antelope still on the plains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned to ride one  --  I learned there . I learned to shoot , too , though at first I was afraid of the noise . But when your father had to be away , I slept with a loaded Colt .45 where I could reach it . Well , dear , it was only sensible  --  there were some very rough people in the West then . There was one boy who worked for your father  --  a Southern boy with shallow blue eyes . He was very polite and soft-spoken while he was with us , but afterward he killed eight men . Well , I 've told you that story . And yet what I remember about him is how nicely he ate and how pleased and shy he was when I gave him a blue handkerchief for Christmas . It 's such a big country , our country . I was brought up in the East but I 'm glad I know more of it than that . I 'll always remember the clear air and the stars so big and near that you felt you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horse called Billy Baxter  --  a pinto with three white stockings . It seems queer to me now that I 've ridden thirty miles a day on Billy Baxter , and the mountains just as far away when we ended as they had been when we began . The ranch never paid but it saved your father 's health , and I was willing to stay . I 'd gotten to love the country and the quiet-voiced people . We were poor for a while , but we didn'tP219care  --  we were young . The first time I helped a woman have her baby , I was afraid that I 'd faint , in spite of being a doctor'sdaughter . But I could n't faint with Mrs. MacPherson there  --  she was a big , red-haired woman with hands like a man 's , and so kind . She 'd had her first baby all alone in a frontier fort  --  her husband had been a captain in the cavalry . But he 'd never been well since they shot him through the lungs  --  he had to retire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than was good for him , but May MacPherson was very good about that . She 'd say , " Captain , is that your first toddy or your second ? " and he 'd say , " Now , light of my life , can you expect a military man to walk on one leg ? " Then she 'd take the bottle away and lock it in the cupboard and he 'd grin like a naughty boy . Your father was very fond of both of them , and so was I. They were good neighbors  --  good neighbors . I remember how shocked I was when I found he was an infidel  --  I must have been a rigid little thing . But he just smiled at me very kindly and said , " Did you ever hear of a division of labor , Mrs. Blake ? It 's like that in our family  --  I do the swearing and May MacPherson does the praying . And if she ca n't pray me into heaven , I 'll think the worse of the place . " Ile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we left the West , I kissed him  --  it surprised your father . Ile said , " Soppy , I did n't know you approved of kissing infidels . " And I said , " Stop joking  --  you know he 's a good man . " That was after your Grandfather Blake died . Well , there was no one else to take on the business , and your father never ran away from a duty . But his heart was never in it , though he 'd work till eleven at night . I was glad when they made the offer and lie could give it up . He talked it all over with me and he was willing to go on . But he 'd always wanted to study law , and I knew it . So we took the chance . He wasP220eight years older than most of the other students , a married man with children , and they used to call him " Pop " and " The Two-Gun Kid , " because we 'd lived in the West . But we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house on Bradford Avenue . The boys were shy , at first ; but when they found we were just as poor as they were , they came around . It was Sunday-night supper and beans  --  I made a bean hole out in the back yard , and when the landlord complained I asked him to supper and he never complained again . A very nice man named Levy . And if the baby waked up  --  that was Ransom first , and then you  --  the boys would help me . It is n't every baby that 's had its bottle heated by a justice of the Supreme Court . Poor Will Laird  --  he came early one Sunday and your father was out and I was very busy . So I gave you to him to hold while I attendedto the beans and lie handled you as if you were glass . I do n't think he 'd ever been that close to a live baby before . I got a very nice letter from Will Laird the other day  --  remindme to show it to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your father retired as dean . He was very anxious for your father to come to Harvard , years ago . But your father felt his duty lay here . Then you children  --  and life going on . A quiet life  --  yes , I suppose so . And yet it seems so full and crowded , when I look back . All the boys in your father 's classes , and sometimestheir boys after them . It sounds quiet enough . But he loved the teaching  --  he loved to try to make them think . And some of them remembered the things he taught them , like Will Laird . He used to say , " Gentlemen , this country is made out of people . The law that does n't remember that is an ass . And so is the lawyer . " It was considered very radical talk for those days . But your father could be very obstinate when he chose.  |p221It  's hard to put down in words  --  some of the things you know . He used to say , " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done our share of the work . " And he never could stand pretensions . Your Aunt Florence has some sort of diploma showing that she 's a Lineal Descendant of King Arthur  --  I remember how that used to amuse him . He was always polite , but he did say to her once , " Well , Florence , if we 'd had to depend on the Lineal Descendants of King Arthur , this country would have stopped at the Allegheny Mountains . I think I 'll form a society of the Lineal Descendantsof Job 's Turkey , and I bet it beats yours all hollow . " Well , he said it laughingly , but he meant what he said . It 's a long road from Great-Grandpa to the little new great-grandchild . I wish I could make a picture of it  --  I wish a picture could be made . We 've been Democrats and Republicansand Populists and ' Whigs and Federalists . We 've gone in wagons and airplanes , on horseback and afoot . We 've built things and torn them down and built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the war before it , the war that kept the Union . That seems very far away , I know . But when I was a young girl , there were scars on some of the houses still  --  scars where the shells had struck . And Mrs. Jenkins ' rosewood dining table with the brass plate where the solid shot had gone through . Just a house like your house or my house  --  an ordinary house where ordinary people lived . I keep thinking of that  --  and yet we had to keep the Union . And I 've been in the hospitals , too  --  I 've heard them breathing , in the hospitals , in the flu epidemic . I do n't think anyoneforgets . I know that a woman does n't . And yet , there was a long time , when your father and I were married and afterward , when it seemed as if things were getting better , not only here but all over the world . That 's what I ca n't explain to Frank and Bertha Junior  --  that feelingwe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was real ,  | it was true . Oh , we worried about bad times , we worried about all sorts of things . But we felt we could get through them , all together . We felt there was a greatness to come . Oh , I know  --  there was the hate and the meanness too . They called your grandfather " Dutchy " ; they yelled " Shanty Irish ! " at Grandma ; they had signs in the West , " No Irish Need Apply . " But when one of your father 's boys called a classmate of his a sheeny , I gave him a talking to , and he listened to mc , I can tell you . We ca n't have that sort of thing we ca n't let it grow on us . It 's just like those nasty beetles  --  it cats the leaves off the tree . I 'm old but I know what I think . If we are n't going to be proud of sonic things and do our best to keep them , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said to your Uncle George , the other day , " You wo n't talk against the President in my house  --  not that way , not the things you 're saying . I 'm proud of my country , and the President 's part of my country . I do n't care what you think about the man  --  though you 've been a bad judge of men ever since I 've known you  --  but you 'll respect the office when you talk to me . I 've washed out your mouth with soap , George , when you were five years old and , old as I am , I 'm ready to do it again . I think you need it . " Well , perhaps I was a little sharp , but you have to be , with your Uncle George . He puffed and blew at me a good deal  --  he eats too many starches for a man of his age  --  but I gave it to him straight . " I 'm an American , " I said . " I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people  --  the good people I 've known all over . I believe in this country . If that 's being senile , then I 'm senile . " He puffed and blew and said , " I never said you were senile , Sophy . I never said anything of the sort . But that man  --  " " Do n't you talk about that man , ' " I said . " Go home andP223get down on your knees and thank God you 've still got a country , and a President who 's elected by the people , and freedom to talk like a fool if you feel like talking like a fool . You 're not grateful enough for what you 've got , and there are too many people like you . We did n't buy this country readymadein a department store  --  we built it up , all together , and it was a long , hard road . Now go home and take your digitalis  --  youprobably need it . " Well , you know , he was as meek as Moses when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only stood up to him , once in a while ! But I believe it . I believe it . It 's terrible news from over there . Sometimes I just ca n't bear hearing it  --  I turn off the radio . But you ca n't shut your ears and your eyes , not even when you 're old . It 's a new , strange world we live in  --  a bitter world since last year . It may be we 're in for hard and bitterdays  --  the world 's so small now . But we made ourselves a free nation . It was n't handed to us on a platter  --  we made it and suffered for it . And , what we made , we can keep . P227There are quite a few proverbs and such about a young man going out to meet his fate . But the only one I ever heard of who did it was a boy named William Riley . And he did n't really intend to . It just happened to him . He lived in a town called Snapperville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he worked for the SnappervilleGazette . That is , he did so summers and after school  --  next year , when he 'd graduated from high school , Mr. Slater was thinking of hiring him regular . He 'd started out by delivering papers and worked up to local items and odd jobs around the plant . And once or twice a year , because he intended to be a real journalist and a power in the community , he 'd get his nerve up and write a slam-bang editorial about civic corrupt ion or how Wall Street preyed upon the farmer or some new subject like fled , Ile never got them printed , of course , because Mr. Slater wrote the editorials himself , but he had the satisfaction of writing them . Once he did show Mr. Slater the one on civic corruption , and Mr. Slater read it and grunted and said , " Well , William , I 'm getting on in years and I 'm sure I 've seen worse . I must have . But next time you talk about flinging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself in and count ten . Because an abysm with teeth is a pretty unusual object for Snapperville . " This encouraged William and he bought a dictionary next day , to find out more about abysms . He hadp228a great respect for Mr. Slater 's opinion because , as everybodyknew , Mr. Slater had once worked for Dana on the Sun . Of course , if you looked at it one way , William 's job was n't very important . And yet it was to him . To be sure , the Gazette came out only once a week , but it covered the whole county , and they had one subscriber who lived as far east as Chicago . And over Mr. Slater 's desk hung the framed front page of the extra he 'd gotten out for McKinley 's assassination . William used to look at that often and hope something like it would happen in his time . He could see himself dashinginto the office with the news . And sometimes on make-up night , when the cranky old press started wheezing , he 'd shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the New York Times or some big paper like that . Then he 'd usually get yelled at by Mr. Slater . But other times Mr. Slater would grunt and allow that lie might make a newspapermanyet , and William would be pleased . Often and often he wondered about the future . Of course , he felt pretty sure how some of it would be . He liked Mr. Slater a lot , but he did n't intend to be just like Mr. Slater . He intended to go to New York and be a great journalist and make a million dollars and reform society and marry the handsomest girl in the world and vote the straight Republicanticket and have his name printed on the front page of the Snapperville Gazette as " our leading citizen . " At least these were some of his intentions  --  they did n't include the times he was going to be President or the times he was going to be a world-famous ventriloquist , but they covered most of the ground . The only thing that really bothered him was what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollarsand missed the girl  --  or started after the girl and missed the million dollars ? He wished he could get a little guidance on that  --  but he knew if he asked Mr. Slater , Mr. Slater would just grunt and ask him if there 'd been any new arrivals on thep2295:30 train . And yet William wanted to know . You generally do , when you 're young . He was thinking about it one make-up day  --  maybe that 's one reason why things turned out as they did . He 'd about decidedthat , sensible or not , he 'd have to have a straight talk with Mr. Slater about his prospects , if any . But when he got back to the office , after covering the registrations at the Palace Hotel ( there were n't any ) , Mr. Slater was in a stew . Mr. Slater was generally in a stew on make-up day , but this one was something special . He looked up as William came in . " Do you know what a man is , William , when he tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's a fool , that 's what he is  --  a congenital , Billy-be-damned fool ! " " Yes , sir , " said William , respectfully , for he knew that only meant that Mr. Slater was having dyspepsia again . " And to add to that , " said Mr. Slater , " to add to the **25;1110;TOOLONG foolishness of the world , we 're short all the way through the paper . I never knew such a dry week for news in my whole life . Our special correspondent at Goose Creek  --  the dear old she-buzzard  --  writes in that she 's suffering from summer complaint and has n't been able to supply her usual string of fascinating information on Goose Creek society . Our special correspondent at Fernville  --  that 's the new girl  --  sends me in a story I ca n't make head or tail of . She says it was a festive occasion , but I ca n't make out if it was a progressive euchre party or a popular hanging  --  she writes the worst hand in seven counties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . The Spanish War Veterans were going to parade , but they have n't . The mayor 's off fishing . T.R. 's in Africa . Nobody 's died , nobody'sbeen married , nobody 's in jail . Not even a local hen has laid an egg with Bryan ' on it . I do n't know what 's happened to the world . Oh , God , if they 'd only send me a couple of massacres and a tornado ! Then they 'd find out I used to 30 work for Dana 's Sun ! As it is , " and he tossed a scrap of copy paper over to William , " there 's some Billy-be-damned organizationfrom nowhere having a basket picnic at Snapper 's Grove . Ted Jenkins was supposed to cover it , but he 's got a lame back again , and I ca n't spare Hod from the press  --  it 's acting up . So go get the story , William  --  it 'll fill up the paper . " " Yes , sir , " said William , feeling excited and pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something 's going to happen today , " and now , sure enough , it had . " How much space can I have , sir ? " " Space ? " said Mr. Slater and yawned . " You can have the whole paper as far as I 'm concerned  --  there 's no news in the world or the universe . String it out , William  --  string it out  --  it 's good practice for you . " He glanced at the scrap of copy paper again . " Call themselves the United Sons and Daughters of Destiny ! " he said . " Lodge , I guess , and a new one on me  --  but if they 're a lodge they 've got members , and they like to see their names in print . You can step by the window and get your trolley fare and twenty-five  --  no , thirty cents ' lunch money  --  I wo n't have it said the Gazette is n't a generous journal . But come back with something or I 'm liable to skin you alive . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put out from the office as if he had wings on his feet . But , after he 'd drawn his expense money , he decided to jump on his bicycle instead of waiting for the trolley . He 'd never had an expense account before and he did n't mean to waste it . It was a five-mile ride to Snapper 's Grove and a hot August day and William was sweating when he got there . But thep231ride gave him a chance to collect himself and put his ideas in order , which was a good thing . Because , even when he first touched that scrap of copy paper , there 'd been a queer little shiver in his mind . Of course , as Mr. Slater had said , the United Sons and Daughters of Destiny was bound to be just another lodge  --  though it sounded like a queer one . But that did n't prevent his wondering and speculating about it . A little while before he got to Snapper 's Grove , he stopped and put on his nickel-plated badge . It said " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it around the office . But this was an important occasion and he felt he could . It was a big shady grove of trees by the river  --  Snapper 's Grove  --  and the whole town was proud of it . There were picnic tables and rustic benches and a stone fireplace and a bandstand , and picnic parties came there from all over the state . It was well kept up , too  --  the town saw to that  --  and , if parties did n't behave as parties should , those parties never got another permit . There were trees in Snapper 's Grove that had been there before there was a Snapperville , and you could still find Indian arrowheads down by the river . It was a pleasant place and people enjoyed themselves there , but always , to William , there was a great sense of ' rime in it  --  Time flowing by like the river , rustling and flowing by like the wind in the trees . You could look at- some of the trees and see initials cut there by hands that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river and wonder bow things had been when the first settlers came . ' When ' William got to the gate  --  sort of rustic entrance it was , beyond the trolley stop  --  Hi Summers , the caretaker , stopped him . " Sorry , Willie , " he said . " No private picnicking today . Grounds rented to a party . " " Oh , that 's all right , Hi , " said William in an offhand way.  | " I 'm here for the paper , " and he swelled out his chest so Hi could see his badge . " Paper , eh ? " said Hi Summers . " Does Ed Slater know about it ? " But he grinned , just the same , and let William leave his bicycle by the gate . " Say , Hi , " said William , " you might kind of start me off . Want to make a statement or anything ? " Hi thought for a minute . " Well , " he said , " if you put anything about me in the Gazette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a u . And of course you might say something about our popular custodian of the grounds . Not that I 've got much time for reading , myself , " he said , " but Mrs. Summers subscribes . " " I 'll certainly do that , Iii , " said William , for he 'd done enough work by now to know how people were . " But I mean about this particular picnic . " Hi thought some more . " Well , " he said , " they 've got a permit and they 're well enough behaved . They got ten gallonsof cream from Ike Schaefer 's and I 've got nothing against them . But I 'm not mixing in any of it "  --  and his mouth got thin and set . " What do you mean by that , Hi ? " said William , feeling rather excited . " I mean what I say , " said Hi , and his voice was stubborn . " They may be foreigners , and then again they might n't be . They may be just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not mixing in any of it . There 's a little wizened-up fellow who claims he knew my great-grandfather . Well , everybody knows my great-grandfather died before the family moved West . And there 's three ladies in an oxcart who say they came from Wisconsin . Well , maybe they did , and they look to be respectable ladies , but the ox has flowers on his horns . Decoration , probably , but there it is . I 'm not mixingP233in it at all . And if you had the sense of a June bug neither would you , Willie  --  paper or no paper . " That was a pretty long speech for Hi , and William thanked him politely . But , as he tried to explain , the Press was the Press and not to be hindered . So he went in and left Hi scratching his head . But as soon as he entered the Grove he began to get the feeling . It was n't anything he could put his finger on , just at first . He 'd seen the Grove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting , some people would have regalia and badges and such . But there did n't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the regalia these people wore . A good many of them were dressed like anybody else  --  and then there was one old man in a leather suit and moccasins who carried a long , old-fashioned gun in the crook of his arm . William rubbed his eyes at that , for he knew guns were n't permitted in Snapper 's Grove , but nobody else seemed to be paying any attention . The three ladies with the oxcart were there all right  --  very handsome they looked in their bright costumes , with their long yellow braids of hair and their icy gray eyes . They seemed to be knitting all the time , but you could n't tell where the knitting began or finished . Then there were the people who looked like pictures out of old books  --  and the conjurers and the sleight-of-hand men and the pitchmen . William could n't sec how they got in  --  games of chance and such were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were . Only these were different , for as soon as one fellowhad finished some sort of trick somebody else would step up from the audience and do it better . He 'd never seen that done before , and it bothered him to see it now.  | And yet , at the same time , he felt a queer exhilaration . He could n't make head or tail of these Sons and Daughters of Destiny  --  he could n't even find anybody who seemed to be in charge . And yet , in spite of the oddness of the occasion , there was something exciting about it . For some reason the light seemed brighter and the air sweeter and the sky deeper than he 'd ever found them before , even at Snapper 's Grove . There was something in the air that reminded him of spring and fall  --  and yet it was neither fall nor spring , as he knew . " It 's outside of Time , " thought William Riley , though he could n't have said how the words came into his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if these people were outside of Time , then he was outside it , too  --  and lie could n't see a soul around that he 'd ever seen before . For a minute he wanted to run out of the Grove as fast as he could , jump on his bicycle , and pedal back to town . And then he remembered the badge on his coat and that he was there for the paper . " Well , whoeverthey are , they ca n't intimidate the Press , " said William to himself , and he looked around for some reasonable citizen to interview . There were n't many who looked just like that . But he finally picked on a wizened little fellow because he had merry eyes . He had a sort of booth rigged up between two big trees and he was spinning a dingy old wheel-of-fortune . It seemed to be mostly for his own amusement , for nobody stopped by to take a chance . So William stepped up to the counter . " Excuse me , " he said , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortune  --  try out your fortune  --  step up and try it  --  everybodygets a prize , " said the wizened old fellow in a singsong voice . Then he stopped and looked at William . " Great Jumping Jehoshaphat ! " he said . " Where on mortalp235earth did you spring from ? I have n't had a customer like you in a hundred years . " " I told you , " said William , patiently , " I represent the SnapperviIle Gazette , Lincoln County 's Foremost Newspaper . And if you 'll just stop whirling that wheel for a minute  --  itmakes me dizzy  --  and give me some first-hand impressionsof this highly interesting gathering  --  " " I told them ! " said the old man , nodding his head . " I told them it was bound to happen ! But they would n't pay attention . Of course , I 'm only a third-degree man , myself  --  never could pass through to the fourth degree , though I 've studied and studied . But I told them just the same . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , that 's right and fitting . But for goodness ' sake pick a grove that is n't all tied up with human living and dying . Otherwise , ' I said , somebody 's likely to walk in without an invitation and then there 'll be a pretty kettle of fish ! ' But they would n't listen , of course , and so here you are . " " Well , that 's very interesting , " said William Riley , who had n't understood a word of it , " but  --  " " Do n't interrupt Inc ! " said the little man . " The Rilcys always were great interrupters . Why , your **28;1137;TOOLONG , Theophilus  --  fleshy man , he was  --  interrupted a cousin of mine , just because he did n't like the fate that seemed to be laid out for him . And what was the consequences ? Well , he had to emigrate anyway  --  that was laid down for him  --  but he had to do it as a bond-servant instead of a moneyed man and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , " said the little man , thoughtfully , " if he had come with money , which was possible  --  you 'd now be named De Lancey Fayerweather Riley III and look quite a bit like an educated codfish . So that turned out all right , on the whole . But in general I do n't advise interruptions . Our work 's hard enough as it is . "   " It must be pretty interesting work , " said William , " and if you could just give me an idea of  --  " " Oh , you 'll see that , " said the little man , and chuckled . " And you 'll get what you came for  --  yes , you 're bound to get that . You 've come at the one time you could  --  the time between boy and man . So you 'll get more and less than you bargained for  --  and what it will do to you , I do n't know . But we might as well start with the wheel . Pick a number ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like doing it , but he picked a number all the same and the little old man spun the wheel and spun the wheel till William felt dizzier than ever . Sure enough , in the end , William 's number came up . " There , " said the little man , triumphantly , as if he 'd done something extraordinary , though William knew about wheels and how they could be fixed . " You see  --  that 's your number , first crack out of the box ! And now you get a prize  --  a prize "  --  and he scrabbled among a lot of little boxes . " There , " he said , and gave one to William . " Now open it . " So William did , and inside there was a nickel-plated badge , just like the one he had on his coat . " What does it say on it ? " said the old man , eagerly . " It says Poultry Inspector , ' " said William , and he did n't sound pleased . The old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , clicking his tongue against his teeth . " There must be some mistake  --  some mistake  --  I ca n't imagine how that happened . Daughter ! " he called , and a girl came out from the back of the booth . And , after the crowd and the dizziness and the talk of the little old man , William felt very glad top237see her , for she was a nice-looking girl . She had brown hair and brown eyes and she looked like all the girls he 'd known and liked in high school . She even had two little goldenbrownfreckles on her nose . " Daughter , " said the old man , " this is William Riley and there seems to be some little mistake about his future "  --  and then his voice dropped as he mumbled to her and scrabbled among the boxes . But the girl , apparently , was used to her father 's ways . She picked out another box , while he was still scrabbling , and gave it to William Riley . " Do n't mind Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gets a little mixed , sometimes . But this is the right one . " And she pinned the new badge on his coat . This one said " Editor and Publisher " and William felt better pleased . " There , I told you so ! " said the little old man and beamed . But William Riley turned to the girl . " Do you go around like this all the time ? " he said . " Excuse me  --  I did n't mean it to sound that way . " " I do n't mind , " said the girl and smiled . " Why , we travel a good deal  --  yes . But Father 's work is really quite light . " " Oh , " said William , rather disappointedly , and fingered the badge with " Editor and Publisher " on it . The girl smiled again . " He always talks about wishing he 'd passed the fourth degree , " she said . " But , honestly , he likes this better . A new town every week or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or bad luck to pass out along the road , because that 's the way of the road . And sometimes Father cheats just a little  --  he 's so kind-hearted  --  and gives out more good luck than the invoice calls for . That 's really why they 've never let him take the fourth degree . Well , I suppose it does make trouble with the accounts . But there have to be a few of us like that . " " I 'm glad to hear it , " said William , but he fingered his badge uneasily . " You mean , if your father was n't kind-hearted  --  well , maybe I was intended to be a poultry inspector , and of course if that 's really so  --  " The girl looked at him with wide brown eyes . " Good heavens , young man , " she said , and her voice was sober , " do n't you ever think about anybody but yourself ? " " I 'm sorry , " said William humbly , for the more he looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted her good opinion . " I guess I am pretty selfish and pretty heedless . But , well , I always wanted to know how things were going to turn out for me . And now  --  " " Do n't I know ! " said the girl . " Why , that 's just the way I often feel myself ! " And they stared at each other . " But you  --  you ca n't feel that way , " said William Riley . " Because , if you are what you are  --  you 're bound to know ! " The girl shook her head . " Not a bit , " she said . " I 'm new . I 'm young . I 'm beginning . I was born in this country . I 'm not very wise , but I 'm growing . I do n't know all I can do yet , but I want to try . I 'm not like one of the Eastern Seaboard destinies  --  not that they are n't very fine stock  --  but I like all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You see , it 's this way , " she said . " All sorts of different people have been coming to this country for years and years  --  and of course , as they came , they brought their fates and their destinies with them . That 's reasonable , is n't it ? " " As you say it , it sounds reasonable , " said William Riley . " Well , " said the girl , a trifle impatiently , " they could n't very well leave them behind . And some were weak and some were strong and some were wise and some were silly  --  just like the people themselves . But , weak or strong , wise or silly , they had to learn American ways . They could n't sit around in damp caves and wait for people to come to them . They had to take care of their people and grow up with the coun-P239try . But it 's too big a country for any one of us to decide about all by ourselves  --  that was n't the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , new ones are born . And so , every few years , we meet  --  but I 've kept you talking too long . Father 's packing up the booth . " " All packed , daughter , " said the little old man , and , when William looked around , there was n't any booth or any wheelof-fortune  --  justa pair of battered black sample cases stacked under a tree . " You are n't leaving ? " said William Riley , with a pang at his heart . " Oh , no , " said the girl , with a laugh . " But we always like to have things neat and shipshape before the meeting . But there 's time left for you to get your story . Come with me . " And she took his hand . William Riley followed her and her father , half in a dream . As they passed through the crowd he heard queer names and queer words . I lc Beard every language and accent that people use in America  --  the clipped New England speech and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lilt of Spanish . He 'd never realized the country was so big and various before . He heard words that were meaningless to him ; he heard people talked about as important whom he 'd never heard of in his life . He realized , of course , that it was bound to be so . But it dizzied him and confused him , try as hard as he would to keep up with it . Ile tried to make notes on his copy paper , but he knew the notes did n't make sense . Finally he drew the girl aside , while her father stopped to chat with the man in the leather suit . " What 's a preview ? " he said . " And a tabloid ? What 's  --    something called insulin  --  does it insulate things ? What 's spurlos versenkt and strict accountability ? Oh , well , you do n't have to tell me . I would n't remember . " The girl smiled at him but did n't say anything . He tried again . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men over there  --  and they look like sensible men  --  are just as worriedas can be . And what are they worried about ? Well , they just got news that some youngster named Schicklgruber back in the old country is growing up just about the way they expected . Now  --  does that make sense ? " " I wish it did n't , " said the girl . " Oh , come on ! " said William Riley , and his voice was exasperated . " A youngster named Schicklgruber ! It sounds like delicatessen . Suppose he does turn out bad . I can see it might worry his folks , at home . But I 'm here in Snapperville . What on earth has it got to do with me ? " The girl looked at him a little sadly . " Yes , you 'll think that for quite a while , William Riley , " she said . " But you 're not one man alone  --  you 're part of a nation and a time . And that nation and that time are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things and people . You 're going to wake up in the morning and wonder what 's happened in China ; you 're going to lie down at night and wonder what 's happened in Egypt . You 're going to make efforts you never thought were in you , and be helped and hindered by men you 'll never see in the flesh . For Snappervilleis n't just Snapperville , William Riley . It 's part of the world . And now we 'd better be getting our seats for the meeting , " she said . Well , William Riley followed her , still in a dream . He had n't taken in a great deal of what she said , and what he had taken in was a worry to him . But the meeting itself was like most meetings . There were resolutions and reports and coin-P241mittees and appeals to the chair  --  and all that helped to steady him down . He took notes about it and hoped he could read them afterwards , when he was n't thinking about those two little golden freckles on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they began to throw the pictures on the screen . He did n't know how they did it  --  he 'd never heard of movies in the open air before . But he always liked the movies and he settled back to enjoy himself . Only pretty soon he was sitting up straight in his camp chair . For these were n't like any movies he 'd ever seen  --  they were real , somehow , though he knew the things in them had n't happened yet . The years began to flicker by , on the screen  --  the years of the future for America and the world . At first ' William was very excited and his pencil wrote like mad . When the man was shot at Sarajevo , he strained his eyes and his ears to remember the names and the dates . Then the film went on . It went on , year after year , with the tumult and the confusion , the waste and the striving and the hope . And here and there William groaned , and at a couple of places he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ! " lie said passionately . " Human beings ca n't act that way ! " " Some can , " said the girl beside him . " And biding your eyes does n't help it . " " But they shot that little fellow over there ! " said William . " I saw them shoot him ! And he was n't doing them any harm . " " I thought you were only interested in Snapperville , " said the girl , and William Riley groaned again . Of course that was n't all he saw . There were places when his cheek flushed and his eye glowed . He saw men stand up against tyranny , he saw men stretch out their hands to help other men . He saw the discoveries and the inventions  --    he saw things that touched his heart like music . But the future 's a hard load to bear for any son of man . Toward the end , the film got vaguer and more disjointed . There were shouts and cries and confusion , the drone of planes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't know quite where it ended . He just knew he was walking with the girl toward the gate of the Grove  --  and they two were alone . " Well , " she said , " have you seen enough ? " " Too much , " said William Riley . " I do n't see how a man can bear it . I do n't see how men live through times like that and come out on the other side . " " No one ever secs till he himself has to do it , " said the girl . " And then , if lie 's worth his salt , he finds that he can . " William Riley turned and faced her . " But why does it have to be me ? Why does it have to happen in my time ? " he cried out , in a cry as old as the world . The girl looked at him . She was n't smiling now , but her face was grave and sweet . " I ca n't tell you that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I can tell you this . There 's fate and there 's destiny  --  and there 's man as well . And too many people make fate an excuse for failure . They 're bright and they 're tired and they see something bad might come , so they just lie down and let it walk over them . Or else they 're all wrapped up in their little concerns and hates and they wo n't listen to anything till fate grabs them by the scruff of the neck . But you  --  you stand up , William Riley ! Because you were born a free man . " " But what can I do ? " said William Riley . " What can I do ? " The girl smiled a little now . " Why , " she said , " you can print the news as it comes and see people 's names are spelled right  --  that 's part of your job . But you can do more . You 'll hear a lot of talk in the days toP243come . You 'll hear this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right from the first . You 'll hear things will never be the same  --  well , they never have been quite the same , to my knowledge , since John Smith came to Jamestown . You 'll hear people say that they ca n't bear to have children with times so unsettled  --  well , if they feel that way , let them  --  I do n't want their children . I 'm young and I 'm free and I 'm growing , and I want the bold and the merry and the enduring . I want the laughers and the thinkers , the strong-hearted and the daring . I 've a need for them and I 'll use them and their bones will be dust in the graveyards , but their fate and mine will go on . And now , goodbye , William Riley . " " But  --  wo n't I ever see you again ? " said William Riley . " Oh , you 'll see me again , " said the girl . " But not as you think . You 'll see me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , in your dreams at night and in the things you find worth keeping . But those will be what you make them  --  and it 's up to you , William Riley . " Then she left him , and William Riley went out of the Grove and got on his bicycle . He wondered how long he could remember what he 'd seen and heard . Ile knew , some-'how , that it could n't be for long . But the girl had n't said anything about not printing the story . Not , of course , that folks would believe it -- he knew enough to know that . But he wondered just how the Fates would get around it . William Riley woke next morning and knew that somethingimportant had happened . Then he knew what it was  --  he 'd written his first big story for the Gazette and it would be in today 's issue . So he dressed as fast as he could and ran downstairs to get the paper .   He looked at the front page eagerly . Yes , there it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His eyes screwed up as he read it  --  he could n't quite remember some things in it , but he knew he must have written it , because he remembered the assignment . " Destiny Picnic Well Attended , " he read . " Sons and Daughters of National Fraternal Body Enjoy Outing at Snapper 's Grove . " I-iis eyes skimmed down the lines . Our popular picnic ground , Snapper 's Grove , was again the scene of mirth and revelry yesterday . An estimated 150 members of the Sons and Daughters of Destiny , a national fraternal body with chapters all over the Union , enjoyed the social distractions of the Grove and the beautiful weather for which our State is famous . . . . A number of interesting speeches were made , dealing with national and international problems , and an al fresco lunch was greatly enjoyed by all . The long-distance cup for the family traveling farthest to attend the convention was awarded to the Mesdames Nora , of Wisconsin , who also presided over the cake table . .. . Our popular confectioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which added greatly to the festivities , and Hiram Summers , our popular custodian of the grounds , performed his duties with his customary tact and thoughtfulness . William Riley put down the paper and frowned a little . It was a good story , all right , a first-class story , and he felt relieved that he 'd gotten Summers spelt with a u . And yet , there was something else that he ought to remember . " So that 's how they got around it , " he said to himself , and then wondered what he was talking about . But whatever it was that he ought to remember still bothered him , and after he 'd finished breakfast he went down to the Gazette . P245Mr . Slater was there , as usual , but , this not being make-up clay , he had his feet cocked up on his desk . " Well , William , " he said , when William came in , " we ran you on the front page . Nice story , too . We 'll make a newspapermanout of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said William , and hesitated . " Mr. Slater , " he said , " did I turn in any other copy last night ? I was pretty tired when I got back and I ca n't quite remember . " " Oh , " said Mr. Slater . " Why , yes , William , seems to me you did turn in an editorial  --  about future developments in the world and such . That what you 're thinking about ? " " Yes , sir , " said William , and waited . " Did you read it ? " " Oh , sure , " said Mr. Slater . " Read it all the way through . You 're improving , William . Why , some of the things you talked about might actually happen . You 've got quite an imagination , William . " And he chuckled . " Had a European war break out at some place I never heard of  --  Sarawitz , or something . " " It was n't Sarawitz , " said William . " It was Sara  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't remember either . " Have you still got it , Mr. Slater ? " he said . " I 'd kind of like to keep it . It might do for a school composition neat year . " Mr. Slater looked guilty . " 1 'm sorry , William , " he said . " If I 'd known you set any real store by it ! But , as it is  --  well , I 'm kind of afraid it got mislaid . " William stood in front of him silent for a moment , while a chill wind blew against his check . He 'd forget ,  --  he was alreadyforgetting ,  --  but things had been shown him , all the same . And even Snapperville would be changed by those things . For a moment lie hated the thought of it ; then his back straightened . " It 's all right , sir , " he said . " It does n't matter . Fate 's fate , but a country 's what you make it . And we 're going to need the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . " Why , William , you 're growing up , " he said . " Well , I guess it was time , " said William , and went out of the office . He knew he ought to feel terribly disappointed about something , but he did n't . Already the last memory of that other story was fading . He supposed he 'd have twinges about it the rest of his life , but he guessed he could stand the twinges . Then he crossed the street , and down by the market square he passed a girl named Ellen Chesney and stopped to speak to her . She was a nice girl with brown eyes and brown hair , like a lot of girls in high school , and he 'd known her all his life and never paid much attention . But today , as they stood there talking , he saw that she had two little golden freckles on her nose . P247Coming home from the office that evening , Harbison was tired . They were n't using the car this winter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was glad to get out and walk the last few blocks to his home . The first snow of the year had fallen that morning  --  in the heart of the city it was already grimed and slushy , but out toward Pershing Heights it was still innocent , cleanly patterned with black footprints and the tires of a few cars . The indescribable smell of it was still in the air  --  it quickened his pace and the strain of the day began to fade from his mind . It was then that he began to notice his shadow . It jogged along with him , now ahead , now behind , as he passed under a succession of street lamps . Now it was long and starving , now short and opulent  --  and there was an instant when it changed It amused him suddenly to think for how many years , with what absurd patience , it had followed him  --  dragged at his heels , willy-nilly , as long as there was sun or light . He stopped  --  it halted at once and lay there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arm  --  it waved a lengthier one in obsequious mimicry . He stamped his feet  --  it jigged like a dark marionette . Then his cars burned with embarrassment and he looked around shamefacedly , to see if anyone had seen him . But most of Pershing Heights was already home and at supper . He felt relieved . Of course he had a shadow , everybody had . But a grown man , a business man , the father of a family ! He must be coming on for a   nervous breakdown , to play such tricks  --  and that was one of the things they simply could n't afford . He resumed his walk , sedately , and tried to think about the pin business . But his mind had been absorbed in it all day and now refused the task . After all , there could n't be any great harm in , once in a while , thinking thoughts that were out of the beaten track . He had neither a dog nor a hobby  --  he might be allowed a shadow . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with shavings . It was submissive , cleanly and silent  --  and , when you turned the lights out , it tactfully vanished away . Or did it ? Perhaps it merely went somewhere else . If one waited up long enough , would one sec all the shadows of Pershing Heights slip out through back doors and hurry toward some antic meeting place ? He checked himself sternly again . He was walking up his own front steps and yet he had hardly noticed them . He assumed a brisk smile and put his key in the lock . Minna met him in the hall as she always did , put up her cheek to be kissed , and said , " You 're late , dear . " Sometimes she said , " You 're on time , dear , " and sometimes , though rarely these days , " You 're early . " In any case , the tone was precisely the same , the tone of a just and competent wife after fourteen years of marriage . He wondered idly , as he kissed her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what point they stopped pretending to their husbands that their husbandswere remarkable men , except sometimes in front of the children . Then the children stamped downstairs and he was engulfed . He played with them , spoke severely to Warren about his report , but authorized the expenditure of a quarter to get his skates mended , admired Janet 's composition and Wilbur'snew front tooth , ate his pot roast with appetite , and heard and commented upon the deficiencies of Mrs. Bemis the laundress . A short report on the singular slackness ofp249the pin trade , though by no means novel , was received with silent assent . Later on , he took Minna to the movies . It was only six blocks away , and Mrs. Pettigrew promised , by telephone , to keep an eye on the house . Anyhow , Janet was very sensible for her age and would be sure to save Wilbur and Minna 's mother 's silver teapot , in case of fire . In case of burglars , on the other hand , she would probably use the teapot as a decoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he watched the heroine of Flaming Flames being pursued through a penthouse by an evil millionaire . Yes , Janet would some day make an excellent wife . And Warren , of course , was his Grandfather Veech all over again  --  people always agreed on that . It seemed odd , though not distasteful to Harbison , that he himself should apparently have left so little impress on the physical and mental make-up of his own children . There was Wilbur , to be sure , but he had caught a look on Wilbur 's infant countenance only the other day that had reminded him strongly of Minna 's Uncle August . " I guess I 'm what they call a good mixer , in those advertisements , " he thought without rancor . " I 've got to be there , but it tastes of the other things you put in . " He glanced for a moment at Minna sitting beside him . Her lips were a little parted as she observed the perils of Daisy Delight , but her face was perfectly calm . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storms and by Latin bravos through banana forests and she knew it would all come right in the end . Even when Daisy was tried for murder , it all came right in the end . In the last sequence , she and the prosecuting attorney were sailing for Europe and a new life on a giant liner , with a great many bon-voyage baskets , including one from the jury . It was all very satisfactory and the way things ought to be . " It 's a good picture , " said Minna , with a pleased sigh .   50 " She 's always awfully good . I liked the dress she wore at the cocktail party . But I could n't copy it , I guess . I 'm too stout through the hips . " " Yes , it 's a first-class picture , " said I-larbison . " One of her best . I 'd like to take a trip on one of those big liners sometime . They 've got week-end cruises , now , that do n't cost as much as regular ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He settled down to enjoy the travel reel . Bronzed youths and maidens swooped down incredible slopes on skis , their shadows flying behind them . It took Harbison back to his last year at State when he and the gang had talked of bummingaround the world . Well , Red Curtis had got as far as Los Angeles . Ile had a nice little bungalow out there and sonic handsome kids  --  sent a picture of them back for the class book . Red Curtis  --  Jimmy Flagg  --  Tod Weiler  --  the ghosts arose for a moment from the past . Ile did n't know why he thought of them as ghosts  --  they were all alive and he saw them , now and then , at reunions . They thumped each other on the back and agreed about the new football coach ; they told stories and sang the old songs . But , late in the evening it always got lonely , somehow , unless you 'd had a lot to drink . Well , Minna did n't mind a drink or two , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even the next day . Perhaps if he had got to France in the war , like Tod Weiler , he would n't be so crazy about travel pictures . Tod said the coonyac was O.K. , but Europe was just a dump and he would n't go again if you hired him . Well , that was all right for Tod , but then he 'd been there . Harbison had spent eighteen months guarding stores in two different arsenals , and that had been interesting , too , but not quite what he expected . Then after that , there had been Minna , and the pin business . It was all perfectly natural and desirable and he had no kick . And yet , somehow , something had escapedP251him , though he could n't put a name to it . Or , rather , something had n't escaped  --  something that wanted to be free . He could feel it struggling now . It was light and quick as a shadow but it was tied . They walked back from the movies in a comfortable silence , Minna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked their shadows . But he did not allow himself to turn his head around . " Better let them alone , " he thought . " Perhaps mine is telling Minna 's of an island in a warm sea , an island full of green parrots and scarlet-bottomed monkeys . But she would n't enjoy that  --  she is probably an industrious shadow and the screaming of the parrots would get on her nerves . " ITc locked the doors , put coal on the furnace , ate an apple , and put the peelings neatly away . Minna had already gone up , the house was quiet and yet alive , for he knew that sleepers lay in it though he could not hear their breathing . It was all right , it was perfectly all right , the good ship I-Iarbison Family rode on an even keel . No storm or peril would come to it that night , and that was good . IIc always liked this last moment of solitude , it made him feel like somebody on guard . " My duty is to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , out of reminiscence . But his shadow seemed to mock the words . It looked oddly youthful tonight and a little disdainful . " I 've got a house and a job . You do n't realize how long that takes , " muttered ITarbison . But the shadow did not seen ' to hear hint . l le went upstairs feeling a little abashed . That was the beginning of a strange time for Ilarbison . Next day , it was not only his own shadow that he noticed but other people 's as well . At first lie fought against it like a sensible man , but after a while lie gave in . People themselves might not be very interesting , but their shadows always were . Mrs. Popham might pretend she did n't gossip , but her shadow was exactly that of a hen who clucks over every egg in the barnyard , and the shadow of Bunce , the baker , was a round loaf topping a long one with two little French rolls for ears . And who would have suspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but an old and pompous sea lion ? Harbison had always been a little afraid of Mr. Whicker , but now that he had seen his shadow in profile , it was hard to retain that fear . There were horse-shadows and deer-shadows , the shadows of fish and apes and plants , but , curiously enough , not many that were really men . Ile rearranged his desk and the chair for visitors so that he could see them more clearly . It seemed to disturb Miss Pickett , his secretary , but he could not help that . Only for Minna 's shadow could he find no likeness . It was like Minna herself , too near and familiar to describe . For some time , Iarbison reveled in a new-found sense of companionship . Business might be dull and clients tricky , but , at the worst , he and his shadow could always exchange a silent nod . Sometimes they even did so about Minna and the children  --  though , on Harbison 's side at least , with no real sense of disloyalty . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to gnaw at his mind . In spite of his efforts to please it , the shadow was not really contented . The little events of daily life that had seemed to amuse it at first amused it no longer . And then , one evening in January , he caught it in open rebellion . He was even wearier than usual , and it may have been only a flicker in the eyes . But as he turned in at his own front steps , he was sure that he saw the shadow jerk back for an instant . The tug at his heels was almost imperceptible  --  no stronger than a spider 's thread  --  and yet he felt it . It did not want to go in , it wanted to go somewhere else . He reproved his shadow for this , when they were alone together in the furnace room that night . It was always very tall in the furnace room and it liked to crouch and waver inP253a hundred impish postures while he shoveled the coal . Sometimeshe would put on a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so playful . But tonight he did not . " Look here , old man , " he said , in a friendly voice just barely tinged with severity . " It wo n't do , you know . You might as well realize that . " The shadow sprawled across the wall , huge and silent . It looked sulky but absurdly like Warren when he was scolded . Harbison relented . " Oh , come , " he said . " You 've been in this world as long as I have . You know what 's allowed and what is n't . Come , let 's shake and forget about it ! " He offered his hand . The shadow raised its own great paw automatically but there was something both lackluster and defiant in the gesture . Harbison felt annoyed . " Oh , well , if you 'd rather have it that way ! " he said , and shrugged his shoulders . " I 'll have to keep my eye on you  --  that 's all . " He went upstairs and the shadow followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what 's needed , " he mutteredto himself . But as he undressed in the dark , to the sound of Minna 's breathing , he smiled . The poor thing had looked so ridiculously discouraged after its scolding . Well , he had shown it who was master , and tomorrow was another day . But on the morrow , as he started to enter his office , he felt that light , almost imperceptible tug again . ' Phis time it prickledthe hairs at the back of his scalp . Things were bad enough anyway , without having to deal with a discontented shadow . He plunged into his correspondence to forget and did the best day 's work he had in a long time  --  anything to keep the shadow out of mischief . Towards the end of the day an impressive caller came , a stranger in a fur coat . He producedreferences from the Chamber of Commerce and Mr. Whicker ; he spoke in large terms of large orders . Harbison listened and quoted figures , but it was half in a dream , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insistent tugging of his shadow . It was bored with all this  --  it wanted to get away . " And now , Mr. Harbison , " said the stranger , leaning forward  --  Harbisonnoticed , without curiosity , that the shadow of his profile on the wall was exactly that of a fox  --  " I 'm sure we can reach some mutual basis of  --  " " No , " said Harbison , suddenly . " No . " The stranger looked astonished . " I beg your pardon ? " he said . " No , " said Harbison , more loudly  --  his shadow was tugginggently but inexorably and he must get it away  --  " there 's nothing to be done . " " You have a very strange way of doing business ! " said the stranger , rising , obviously aggrieved . " I assure you , my refer-ences  --  " " It does n't matter about references , " said Harbison , wearily . " Oh yes , good night and all that  --  Miss Pickett , will you show this gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obeyed . He slumped in his chair . The shadow was very tiresome . Just because it had been bored by the stranger 's conversationMiss Pickett re-entered , still with the strange look on her face . Harbison straightened up . " Yes , Miss Pickett , " he said . " Take a  --  " Then he passed his hand over his forehead . " Did I ring ? " he said . " No , Mr. Harbison , " said Miss Pickett in a shy voice . " But you told me , some time ago , to remind you about our note at the bank . It falls due the end of this week . " She paused . " Oh yes , " said Harbison . " Of course . " He was looking at her shadow  --  it was a great relief after the stranger 's . " Well , that will be all right , " he said , hardly knowing what he said . P255Miss Pickett looked intensely relieved and rather young . " Oh , I 'm so glad , Mr. Harbison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really is n't my business but you 've been so decent to all of us  --  and I think Mr. Whicker was simply horrid about  --  " " It 'll be all right this time , " said Harbison firmly . He was absorbed by the fact that now Miss Pickett 's shadow was in the room , his own no longer tugged . A horrid suspicion crossed his mind and he stole a hurried glance behind him . Miss Pickett had noticed nothing but his shadow was gazing at hers with obvious approval . He blushed to the tips of his ears and dismissed her hurriedly . Things could not go on like this . So it was that when the shadow tugged again , in a definite direction as he left the office , he let himself be guided where it wished to go . If he humored it in one way , he thought desperately , it might be more docile in others  --  and he simply could not have it upsetting his office force . Nevertheless , as he followed , he felt greatly disturbed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the brightly lighted window of a travel agency . Harbison stared at the gaudy leaflets and the model steamship , the special rates to Calcutta and Genoa . " No , " he said to himself in a violent whisper , " No ! " The shadow did not even bother to answer  --  it had won its point . Ile tried the door of the agency  --  it was locked , but the shadow seemed to understand that . Next day , during the lunch hour , they went back . It was all so much easier , thought Harbison , once you had given in . He was no longer tired and his mind felt clear as a bell . He had an astonishing capacity for work and the figures of the business crept upward , week by week . The shadow only tugged now and then , by way of reminder , for the shadow understood . It was agreed between them that the shadow must escape from this life it hated to that green and tropic island that had always been its desire . But to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that meant money and tickets and other things . And there was only one way that one could get those . Harbison wondered , sometimes , that more people did not plan to loot their own businesses . It could be done so simply , provided you had a shadow to consult on matters of detail . Cf course , the business must be built up first , to be worth the looting . But that was simple , too , as simple as renewing the note at the bank . Mr. Whicker had been difficult at first , and Harbison had grown impatient . He was suddenly tired of being catechized by people like Mr. Whicker  --  what business had a man with , a shadow like a sea lion 's telling him what to do ? " Do n't bark at me like that or I 'll never give you another piece of fish ! " he said , abruptly , to the sea lion shadow on the wall . Mr. Whicker goggled . " What , what ? " said Mr. Whicker . " I said there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got taken in by that fellow in the fur coat . But he was too foxy for me  --  I mean I was too foxy for him , " said Harbison . " I hope he did n't stick you for any of his paper . " " He had the impudence to use me as a reference . Quite unauthorized  --  quite unauthorized , " said Mr. Whicker , but his eyes were uneasy . " Now , as regards this renewal  --  " " I do n't merely want to renew it  --  I want to double it , " said Harbison promptly . " We 're expanding all along the line and the Little Goliath Clip is going like wildfire . As for the safety-pin side of it , we 've got a campaign mapped out on ' Protect-Your-Baby - From - Wounding- Old-  Fashioned-Pinpoints  --  Babykins , the Scientific Modern Fastener , Will Solve Your Diaper Problem ' that 's going to sweep the country . The big fortunes of the next twenty years are going to be made by the people who have courage and vision enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , too . Now , just take a look at  --  " He went on , quoting facts and figures . P257The strange words seemed to pour from his mouth without volition , and yet , as he spoke them , he knew somehow that they were true . They had been at the back of his mind for years , these ideas and plans , but he had never had the courage to put them into action . He had thought of Minna 's disapproval , of Mr. Whicker 's scorn . But these things seemed little , now that he and his shadow were at last on the way to their goal . The telephone was always buzzing these days  --  the office had a different look  --  a look of success . He was asked to speak before the Chamber of Commerce  --  it was a trial , but the shadow carried him through . Of course , it would n't last  --  it was all for a purpose  --  but now and then he almost forgot the purpose in the excitement of the work . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rebellion . Ile spent an evening in the city library , looking up the subject of shadows , but only one book seemed to have any bearing on his case , and that was the story of a man who had lost his shadow and so no help . There were moments when he would have been glad enough to lose his shadow  --  but how ? Perhaps a priest  --  an exorcism  --  but Minna and he had always been Methodists . He could see the note in the paper : " Mr. and Mrs. John Paul Harbison gave a small exorcism at their residence yesterday for a few intimate friends . Father Duffy officiated and , following the ceremony , light refreshments were served . " No , it would n't do at all  --  there was no help anywhere . For an instantHarbison had a timid thought  --  if not God , then perhaps , the Other ? There were historic precedents and a tradition of efficiency , at least . But no . Such visitants , even at their most gentlemanly , would be likely to frighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harbison resigned himself to his fate . After all , it was n't his fault . He would have been glad enough to take Minna and the children , but anyone who knew both Minna and shadows could see the impossibility of that . Afterwards , he supposed , Minna would go to live with Uncle August  --  she had always been his favorite niece . Later on , she would marry again , but Harbison felt no jealousy thinking of that . It was natural that Minna should be married  --  so natural that it did not much matter to whom . The childrenwould miss him for a while , but she would be very sensible about it , and they would soon forget . And , meanwhile , the shadow seemed to whisper to him , meanwhile  --  they would be running races with the wind on the golden sands of that far island , his shadow and he . He could feel the heat already warming his bones . " You arc not looking like yourself these days , John Paul , " said Minna firmly one evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , automatically , " you know what business is . " " But it is doing very well , " said Minna unexpectedly . " You have given me more house-keeping money , and Mr. Whicker stopped me on the street the other day . He said you are one of the coming men . " " That 's interesting , " said Harbison . " But we have heavy commitments . " He liked the sound of the phrase . " Heavy commitments , " he repeated ; then , dismissingly , " Oh , I 'm all right . Do n't worry about it , dear . " But Minna , astonishingly , stood her ground . A faint pink showed in her cheeks . " It is right that I should worry if you are worried , " she said rather didactically . " A wife must take care of her husband and see he does not do foolish things . " Harbison stared at her , with a terrible surmise in his mind . Behind him , his shadow seemed to crouch and shrink up into nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , if she did  --  P259She turned and produced something from a sewing bag . " Here , " she said . " Here is a muffler that I have knitted you . It is cold , these March days , and you have a long walk from the bus . " Harbison took it from her  --  it was gray , warm , and sensible . But at the end was a little scarlet fringe . " It brightens it up , " said Minna , apologetically . He stooped and kissed her , feeling like Judas as he did so  --  but a Judas whose betrayal was not yet discovered . That night in the furnace room the shadow was very threatening . They could not risk delay  --  they must act at once . When Harbison stole into his office at night some days later , he had a sensation of being followed . He put it down to the shadow , but it did not please him . The shadow had seemed to grow more corporeal with each day of the last two weeks . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . He wondered , with a sensation that was beyond fear , if this would continue . If one grew , the other must diminish , that was evident . He could see on the sands of the island a tall , running figure , shaped exactly like his own , but black and comely . The shadow it cast was singularly pale and dim ; it complained at times in a small voice like the piping of a sea bird , for it still had the gift of speech , but the words were barely audible . Yet , even if this were to be so , Harbison felt that he did not care . He desired nothing so much as an end to the struggle , a peace . He took the money front the safe and put it on the desk to count it . It was a great deal of money . You could pay off a note at the bank with it  --  or do outer things . The tickets were in his billfold  --  lie had been clever about those . They would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man whose shadow was stealing him away . And at some port , they would simply be left behind . After that , it would be time for the shadow to plan  --  he had done his best . P26o " Working late again , Mr. Harbison , " said the watchman respectfully , as Harbison passed out of the building . " Yes , " said Harbison , " working late . " He turned the cornertoward the station  --  it was n't far and he might as well walk . His bag was at the station , a new bag , with everything in it new . Behind him , his shadow fairly seemed to skip . It was all right now and everything was attended to . Then a horrible thought struck him . He could not remember whether he had stoked the furnace since morning . If he had not , the fire would die in the night and Minna might wake up with a cold . He was leaving her behind , to be sure , but that was a different matter . For twelve winters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the furnace . He would never have to do it again but he suddenly knew that , this last time , he must . He looked around for a cab . There was plenty of time  --  the train did not leave till one . He had planned to get aboard at eleven and be sure of a good night 's rest . But that did not matter , now . Harbison dismissed the cab at the corner of the street and waited till it had gone away . Then he walked forward , quietly , the brief case crammed with its treasure in his hand . There was the house , still and dark . No stranger could have picked it out , even in daylight , from any other of the houses in the row , but he knew every chip in the paint . And yet , tonight , he looked at it , as if he were seeing it for the first time , and that seemed strange to him . He prowled soundlessly toward the rear of the house  --  best go in by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped up with the baseball and the mended railing where Janet had fallen and cut her lip . He had always meant to do something with the back yard but he never had . Once Minna and he had bought some cheap rosebushes , and he 'd meant to put up a pergola . But he was n't handy with toolsP261and the rosebushes had n't lasted . Next time , he would go to the library and read a book on gardening  --  only there would be no next time . Great , vivid flowers bloomed on the far islands  --  flowers with magic odors and petals smoother than cream . The scent must grow oppressive after a time , thought Harbison suddenly . He stared up at the windows and saw , with a queer shock , that one was lit . Wilbur must have wakened in the night with a bad dream , as he sometimes did , for on the blind was the shadow of a woman bending over a bed . Her hair was down her back in two childish plaits and the dim light made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen Minna 's profile for a long time . The light went off as he watched , and he held his breath . After a moment , the light in the bedroom would go on , and she would go back to bed . But it did not . Instead , the window of their room opened and she looked out . He thought for a moment that she must have seen him , and shrank further back into the shadows . But she had not . She was not looking at him , she was not looking at the yard . She was looking out at the frosty stars . There was weariness on her face , and the starlight could not give it back its youth , but there was a certain content as well . It accepted life , root and branch , without rancor , it would not seek far horizons but it would not run away from shadows . I larbison rememberedtrying to tease her , when they were first married . She had n't quite known how to take it , but she had enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from a pink dress she used to wear to the fact that she had always wanted him to be more like Uncle August but had never complained because he was not . There was a great deal that he remembered , in a very short time . They had come new , to the new house , now both were worn . " Its not such a bad house , either , " murmured Harbison .   Now she shivered , crossing her arms like a girl , and turned away from the window . But as she did so , there was a slight smile on her face . So there were times when she , too , was glad to be alone . He had not suspected that . Harbison found the old key on its place on the nail and crept silently into the house . He left the brief case in the living room  --  he did not wish to be encumbered . The fire in the furnace was low , as he had suspected . If Minna did hear him , she would think nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harbison bent and straightened , shovel in hand , and on the wall his shadow bent and straightened too . Harbison nodded his head . " Enjoy it while you can , " he said softly . " It 's the last time . " His overcoat made him hot and he flung it off . " No , there 's only one way to settle this , " he said . He stood up panting . Then , slowly he took the tickets and the check for the bag at the station from his wallet . IIe weighed them in his hand , for a moment  --  they were parrots and monkeys and an island . Then he flipped them through the furnace door . They did not catch at once , but they caught soon enough . There was only one way in the world to get rid of a shadow . But it must look like an accident or little boys and girls would be hateful to Warren and Janet at school . The second step on the stairs going down to the cellar had always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  nowit would give under weight . They were steep stairs , steep as a ladder  --  he had always been afraid of tripping and crashing headfirst to the concrete floor . Well , that did not matter any more . He must remember not to throw out his arms . His shadow was huge , as he stood at the top of the stairs . But , like the huge bullies in stories , it was a coward . It shivered on the wall because it knew what he was going toP263do . Harbison felt both triumph and sickness . It would never run on golden sands now  --  and that was a pity . But when it came to the pinch , a man must think of his home . The muffler that Minna had knitted was still loosely slung over one shoulder . He thought of taking it off , but he was too tired . He switched off the light , now shivering a little himself , and stepped firmly forward through the darkness . As the stair gave , he plunged . Then he was flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a sudden wrench at his body , and a sparkling crash . Harbison woke , and stared with mild interest at the shadow of a tree on a window blind . He waited for it to change into something evil , but it did not change . He made a sound in his throat . " Drink this , " said a voice . He turned his head with difficultyand saw a woman in a starched cap . " It wo n't put me to sleep again , will it ? " he said , after lie had drunk . " I want to be awake for a while . " " You can be , " said the nurse , with a smile . " It 's all right , Mr. Harbison . You 're out of danger . " " Danger , " said Harbison . " Yes . I was in danger . " " Well , " said the nurse , " those , stairs arc something fierce in those old houses . It 's a wonder people do n't break their necks every day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did it ? " said Harbison . He was observing her shadow with curiosity  --  it was neither the shadow of magpie nor chattering squirrel , but merely the shadow of a girl in a starched cap  --  and he felt an intense relief . " Uh-huh , " said the nurse . " It caught on a nail or somethingand kind of slowed you around . Broke the fall . Things might n't have been so pretty except for that . But you 're dandy now . " She smiled a gleaming , professional smile .   " Now you 'll be wanting to see Mrs. Harbison , " she said . When Minna had told him about the children and the weather and the events of the town , he lay back with his hand in hers and they both were silent . There was one question he wanted to ask her but he did not know quite how to put it . " They got the money all right ? " he said . " I suppose I was silly to bring it home but I got worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Cooper  --  " " Yes , yes , " said Minna soothingly . " It was all in the brief case . I telephoned Miss Pickett and she knew it was to pay the bank . " " She 's a nice girl , " said Harbison . " I Lope she gets marlied . " I lc paused again . " Minna , " he said , in a low voice , " I got tickets for a cruise . " " There was a letter from the steamship company , " said Minna , placidly . " I opened it . I thought it might be important . " She patted his hand for a moment . " It was to be a surprise , was n't it , John Paul ? You were always a man for surprises . " " Yes , " said John Paul . " It was going to be a surprise . " He looked intently at her calm eyes . They were deeper than he remembered  --  deeper and more comprehending . " You did n't think I was running away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a low voice . " Why , no , " said Minna slowly . " You are a good man , " she said . It was something not to be argued or controverted . " Besides , there were two tickets , " she said , with a little smile . " Yes , of course there were two tickets , " said Harbison , shivering a little . He raised his head . Upon the wall lay his shadow . He saw it clearly  --  the shadow of a middle-aged man with the hair already thin . It was neither magic nor dreadful , merely comfortable . The bandages on his head gave it a Turkish appearance . He nodded to it , as to a ridiculous old friend .   " You will be disappointed about the cruise , " said Minna . " I am sorry . " " Oh it does n't matter , " said Harbison . " We can take one some time when the children are older . They ought to see something of the world . " His head had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he left the hospital he would still notice shadows , but they would no longer be the shadows of goat or ape . They would be human and follow their owners obediently , even to the last extremity of the flesh . " We 're all tied by the heels , in a way , but I do n't suppose it matters so much , " thought Harbison . " Not as much as we think , at any rate . " " Well , anyhow , we can go to Big Lake for the summer , " he said . P266RIGHT from the first we had trouble with Louella Weedon . Trouble was , she would n't stay put . What I say is , if you 're going to be a ghost , you ought to act like a ghost . That 's reasonable . If you want to  --  well , haunt a place and feel upset enough about the troubles you 've had to do it  --  that 's to be expected . But Louella Weedon was different . They were always strong-minded , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last of them , was a kind of institution with us . We 'd seen her grow up from a child  --  plain child she was , but stubborn ; we 'd seen her take care of her father and her mother and her Aunt Minnie . As long as they lived , she did her duty by them , as New England women will . And when she was left alone , she kept on doing it . She did only one really peculiar thing that I recollect . Once a year she 'd spend two weeks in New York City , and , though there were plenty of women she could have asked to go with her , she always went alone . We thought that was pretty bold of her at first , but after a while it just got to be a custom , and part of Louella . She never married . I do n't mean that she did n't have offers  --  she did . But while they lived , her family always persuadedher that the suitors were n't good enough . And afterwardsit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who said it drove Sam Owlett to drink  --  her turning him down  --  but you never had to drive Sam in that direction . He went on his own  |p267two  feet . And if the town laughed a little about her and Monroe Taylor , we did n't mean any harm . Monroe was teller in the bank , but he came from Northport , and nobody knew much about his folks . Well , Louella took him up , as you might say , and he called on her every week or so , that last year . It says a good deal for Louclla that even that did n't give rise to any particular gossip . After all , she was a leading citizen , and the boy did n't know many folks in town when he first came . I call him a boy , but of course he was older than that  --  middle twenties and more . But he seemed young to me , and it 's hard to refuse a kindness when you 're young and lonely . He advised Louella about some things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , but that seemed to be all it was . All it could be , too , for it seemed sort of written in the book that Miss Louellawas bound to be the last of the Weedons . I know it surprised me a bit , when I read her death notice . I 'd been thinkingof her as an old maid for as long as I could remember . And yet she was only forty when she died . After that , we got used to the Weedon house being shut up and empty except for the caretaker who came in once a week to dust and wind the clocks . Louclla had directed in her will that things were to be that way till the house was sold or disposed of . So t here it was , and the first time in a hundred years that there had n't been a Weedon in the house . Only , coming back from the funeral , Ellie Rodgers made a curious remark to inc . She 'd lived next door to the Weedonsall her life , and she knew Louella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , with her black eyes snapping , " but I wonder if she 'll stay put . " " Now , Ettie , " I said , kind of soothing . But she looked square at me . " No , I 'm not crazy , Cy Marshall , " she said , and sniffed in her handkerchief . " I 'm just wondering . Louella was stubborn enough , but she never got much of what she wanted . She should have had marriage and a family  --  yes , even if she 'd had to marry that Taylor boy . But she was a Weedon , and nobody ever let her forget it . " I did n't think much of it at the time , because Ettie always had notions . But I thought of it later , when the talk about Monroe Taylor began . He 'd acted very proper at the funeral  --  everybody said that . And everybody felt kind of sorry for him . But when he started taking Jean Moffat home from the library , evenings , people started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself  --  seemed suitable to me . She was n't one of your **31;1167;TOOLONG ; she was pretty as you could ask for , and with lots of gumption , too . But the way people talked , you 'd have thought Louella was the love of his life and he was bound to spend the rest of it mourning over her memory . That 's the way towns are . I stood up for him all I could  --  I do n't hold with gossip . I liked Monroe  --  always had  --  and I liked Jean Moffat . I 'd seen her stand up to her Board of Trustees on one or two things , and I 'd seen how she handled the children and the young folks in the library . And she certainly did wonders for Monroe . He 'd always been the serious kind ; but now he began to smarten up and take an interest in the kind of neckties he bought . And Jean began to look sort of happy and proprietary . I was expecting their engagement to be announcedand was all ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary  --  I 'm a director of the bank  --  when the thing happened . I 'd been down with influenza that April  --  got it one ofthose raw , sunshiny days that fool you . Took me almost amonth to get on my feet again , and when I did manage toget downtown and set eyes on Monroe Taylor , I was shocked . I thought at first he must have had the influenza too . ThenI saw it was n't that . He looked just the way he always had ,  |p269sober  and overworked  --  but there was something more . Now and then he 'd have a look you do n't want to see on anybody 's face  --  the look of someone who 's being pushed to the wall and knows it and ca n't help it . I tried to jolly him along and told him to come around and see us  --  and bring Jean , too , if he felt like it . And he thanked me very politely , but you could see he was n't listening . It was n't till a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd seen Jean Moffat , and there was something wrong there . She looked cool and fresh , as she always did , but the warmth had gone out of her smile . Well , that was n't the way it should be , and I felt sorry . But I put it down to an ordinary kind of lover 's quarrel . I did for a fact . I work nights at the office sometimes ; it 's quieter then . And this was one of the first fine May nights  --  kind of night when you think you can smell lilacs even though you do n't . I had the window open , and it was after nine o'clock . Then I heard the steps coming up the stairs . You can tell when it 's a person in trouble when you 've lived as long as I have . It was Monroe Taylor , and I knew the minute I saw him that the trouble was a deep one . Ile sat clown when I told him to , but he had his hat in his hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said finally , " might I consult you about a personal matter  --  very personal ? " " That 's what I 'm here for , Monroe , " I said . " Though I 'd better say first that if it 's anything about the bank  --  " " It is n't , " he said wearily . Though I do n't blame you for thinking it . Oh , God , if only it were the bank ! " he said . " If I 'd only stolen money and could go to jail for it  --  why , I 'd be as happy as a clam . " Well , I thought that was just one of those high-flown speeches that younger folks make , and I 'd better straighten him out . " Now , Monroe , " I said , " if it 's this town talk that 's worry- ing you  --  well , I was born here , and I 've lived here all my life . And it 's a good town . But there 's a few ladies that would gossip in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It ought n't to worry you , and it ought n't to worry Jean Moffat . If you 've had a quarrel , make it up . And let them go hang . " " Do n't you suppose I want to ? " he said , and his voice was hoarse . " But I ca n't , Judge Marshall . I just ca n't . I do n't dare to  --  not for Jean 's sake . You do n't understand . It 's Louella . " " Louella ? " I said , kind of taken aback . " Yes , " he said . " You see , I 've seen her . Since . I  --  I see her about every week now , just the way I used to . I go up to the house and call , and she 's there . Sometimes she 's sewing . Sometimes . . . . Oh , well , you would n't believe me , and what 's the use ? " lie stood up . " I guess I 'll be going , Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no use telling me to go and see Doc Robinson . I know what he 'd think about it , and I do n't care to do that . If I have to go to State Asylum , I 'll go on my own feet . " " Sit down , Monroe , " I said . " Sit down . " And I got the bottle out from behind the Statutes of the Commonwealth and poured him a hooker . I made it a stiff one , too , for I thought the case justified it . But even so he was jumpy as a scared horse , and it took time to get him settled and the story out of him . Well , of course I did n't believe him , even at that . But there was something about the way he told it , sitting there in my office , with his gray hat twisted in his fingers and the warm May air floating in . You see , he was n't the kind of person a thing like that ought to happen to . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank teller 's clothes , talking about something that could n't possibly have happened , with the sweat pouring down his face . It had started that same day that I got the influenza -- late afternoon of that day , with that queer false spring in the air.  |p271He  was going to have supper with the Moffats and take Jean to the movies . But as he went past the Weedon house he thought of Louella Weedon , which was only natural . She 'd given him his start in the town , in a way , and , now he was in love with Jean , he felt grateful to her . He remembered little things she 'd done and little things she 'd said . Now I 'm not excusing him at all . It would flatter almost any man to have a woman like that take an interest in him . And he 'd say the pleasant little things that a man would be apt to say under such circumstances . Especially a stranger . He would n't even think of Louella as an old maid , necessarily-he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't excusing him . But you see the way it could be . All the same , when he thought of Louella , he thought of her with sadness but with a sort of relief . For he had a suspicion that it might n't have been so easy , bringing Jean around to call on her . And yet he 'd have had to do it . It was just about then that he noticed the Weedon gate was n't shut . Well , he thought the caretaker must have forgotten , so he stopped for a minute to latch it . And as he did so , he saw a curtain move inside the house . He said lie was sure of that . He said it gave him a queer feeling  --  that and the smell of false spring you could feel in the dusk . He said that 's why he went in . But he said the queerest thing was that he knew the door would open t he m i n u t e he put his hand on the knob . He used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever sat in the front one . He said , once he was inside the house , he felt he had to go there . And lie went , and there she was . He said it was n't till he left the house that he began to realize what had happened to him . And then he groaned aloud . He was late at the Moffats ' , and Jean did n't like that very well . Then they went to the pictures together , and it was a good picture  --  but he just could n't keep track of it . He 'd keep seeing Louella , the way she 'd been in the back parlor , and hearing her voice instead of the voices on the screen . She 'd had her sewing basket on the little table in front of her , just as usual , but she 'd been different . And he knew what the difference was . He knew it now that he was in love with Jean . Well , Jean practically had to nudge him when the picture was over and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wondering if he was damned or crazy or both . Oh , he explained to her , of course . About having a headache and working late at the bank . You know how well most men explain when they 're put to it . It left a sort of coolness between them . And when he went back to where he boarded , there was n't a more miserable young man in the state . He did n't go back past the Weedon house  --  he went the long way . But he knew he 'd have to go back there , at his regular time . Louella had let him know that , and she 'd be expecting him . Well , ever since then it had been going on . I tried to get him to explain why , granting it was true , he could n't break loose , and then he got sort of incoherent . He kept saying nobody could understand who had n't been through it ; or know what it was like to be tormented by two women at the same time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess that would be hard to explain  --  but I knew the Weedon stubbornness . When they reached for anything , they closed all five fingers down on it . I 'm not saying whether I believe the boy or not , but when I finally got him quieted , I felt sorry for him . I really did . Next morning I went around to see Ettie Rodgers . I 've known her a long time ; and if she 's got notions , she 's got sharp eyes , too . We talked along for a while , and finally I asked her if she 'd noticed anything queer at the Weedon house . " Nothing except Louella Weedon , " she said , with a snapP273of her handbag . She looked at me straight . " I told you at the cemetery she might n't stay put , " she said . " Well , she hai n't . " I laughed , of course . " Laugh all you like , " she said . " I 'm her next-door neighbor , and I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've seen Louella Wecdon , just as bold as brass , walking up and down in her garden in the cool of the evening . She 's got a new hairdo , too , and a bare-necked dress . Bare-necked and bare-armed , " she said with a sniff . " Heathen , I call it . Well , I believe in keeping yourself to yourself . But if she ever comes over here , I mean to give her a piece of my mind . " She looked at me , sharper than ever . " Monroe Taylor ought to have more sense , " she said . " Or somebody ought to . " Well , I knew by that the fat was in the fire ; for , in spite of what Ettie said , she 'd keep a thing to herself only so long . I did n't want a lot of smart city reporters in town , makingwisecracks about a ghost hunt and telephoning fool stories all over the Union . It is n't fitting or respectable . And from the way Monroe Taylor looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I got the key of the house  --  I 'm executor under the will  --  and I went around . Of course I did n't need the key , for when I turned the knob , the door was unlocked , just as Monroe had said . I held it in my hand for a minute , making a mental note to blow up the caretaker about leaving it that way . Then I opened the door and went in . There 's always something creaky and strange about a house that 's been shut up , no matter How you ( lust it . The light is n't quite the same , and the rooms are dim . Yes , even if it 's your own house , that 's true . I knew the Wecdon house almost as well as my own . And the minute I got inside the door I began wishing I 'd come in the morning instead of late afternoon . I was n't afraid of Louella  --  naturally not . I went straight to the back parlor and looked around . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to anybody . There was n't anything peculiar in the back parlor . The vases that Captain Abijah brought back from China stood on the mantelpiece just where they 'd always stood . And there was the high china cupboard , built in the wall . It all looked the way I remembered it . There was the sewing basket on the table with some half-finished work in it  --  but naturally that would be there . Everything had been left the way it was when Louclla died . I was going to look at the sewing , and then I decided not to . If I had , I 'd have started wondering if any of the stitches were new , and that would have bothered the . There were n't any flowers around , but there was a smell like strawberry shrub . Louclla had always been very fond of that scent . I tried to remember when we first got strawberry shrub  --  I thought it was early for it . But I could n't remember . Then I did a pretty foolish thing ; I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in the tidy back parlor of that empty house , and said , " Louella  --  Louella Weedon . " As if I was callingher . I said it low at first , then I said it quite loud . There was n't any answer right away ; just the scuttlings and creakings of an empty house . But after a while I got an answer . It was n't what I expected ; it was n't words or sorrow , it was just a laugh . I knew Louella 's laugh  --  it was dry and sharp . This one was n't . It was full and rich , the deep laugh of an exultant woman . But it was Louella 's all the same . You ca n't mistake a person 's voice when you 've known it . And this was mocking past description  --  mocking and exultant . But it was Louella 's still . I stood hearing it , while the hairs at the back of my neck prickled . And then I got out . Yes , I even locked the door behind me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there 'd beenP275any sense in staying , I 'd have stayed . But there was n't , and I knew what I 'd better do . You do n't take that kind of thing to a brand-new minister  --  I do n't care how many degrees from Union Theological he 's got . But Minister I Icndcrson was still living up at North Center . He 'd been with us forty years before he retired , and I felt he was the right man . Well , I felt like a fool on my way up there , but when I did explain it to him , he took it very calm . Come to think of it , there ca n't be much you could . surprise a minister with when he 's been forty years in a town . And of course there was plenty of authority for similar cases . He showed me one out of Wonders of the Invisible World . That was in Cotton lather'stime , but New England 's still New England . Then we got on to the more practical side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear and say , according to tradition . But he said this was a neighborhood matter , and lie meant to treat it as such . And if there was a spirit to be dealt with and exorcised , he was still a minister of God , and he 'd do his part . I would n't have felt right if he 'd said anything else . He agreed that Monroe Taylor would have to he there . But it was me that insisted on Ed Parsons , too . I knew he was bound to hear about it . sooner or later , being president of the bank , and I did n't want what he Beard to work against Monroe . Ed 's a hard-headed than , and what- he does n't see himselfhe does n't believe ill . So l wanted him to see . All the same , I felt queer when I let them into the Weedon house that particular night . ' There was Monroe Taylor , white as a candle , and Ed Parsons , grumpy and grumbling , and Minister Henderson , old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back parlor and lit the lamp . The curtains were drawn  --  I 'd attended to that  --  and you could n't see a thing from outside . Everything was just as I 'd seen it , and the smell of the strawberry shrub was very sweet and piercing . I could see Ed Parsons notice that and not admit it . Well , we had a little prayer . And then I felt queerer than ever . For we sat there quite a while , listening to the rustlings and the creakings , and nothing happened at all . Finally Monroe Taylor broke the silence . " It 's no use , " he said in a low , strained voice . " It 's only for me , you know . If you 'll all go away , she 'll come . And I guess that 's right . She 'll come , and we 'll talk the way we used to . I did n't know she counted so much on it . Oh , God , my punishment is more than I can bear ! " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I would n't have given much for Monroe 's chances at the bank . But just then we heard the laugh . It came , low and rich , low and mocking  --  the laugh of an exultant woman . You could n't tell just where it came from  --  that was the queer part . But it pulled Monroe Taylor out of his chair as if he 'd been drawn by cords . " She 's calling , " he said . " I 'd better go to her . " And his eyes were like a sleepwalker 's . But Minister Henderson laid a hand on his arm . " No , my son , " he said . He raised his voice only a little , but it seemed to fill the house . " Louella Weedon , " he said , " I am speaking to you . Why do you torment this young man ? " " Monkeyshines , " grumbled Ed Parsons ; but he grumbled it under his breath , for the minister was going on . " I am speaking to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And if you are evil , I bid you begone to your own place . But if you are otherwise , I bid you manifest yourself and say why you torment us . " " Monkeyshines , " said Ed Parsons again , but louder , as if he wanted to hear the sound of his own voice . And then he jumped and sat still . For there was another laugh , and after it a voice , very clearP277and distinct and recognizable . And the voice said : " Monkeyshines , Ed Parsons ? That 's all you know . " No , I do n't expect you to believe it . Looking back , I hardly believe it myself . I remember staring at the glass lampshade  --  it had a kind of pattern of leaves and flowers on it  --  and wishing that anything would happen to make the voice go away . But it was Ed Parsons who spoke . " That 's Louella Wecdon 's voice , " he said . " And she 's dead , so it ca n't be . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I guess I 'll go home . " He made a motion to move , but he did n't , for the laugh came again , low and vibrant , and we all sat as still as mice . I 'd never thought Ed Parsons was a coward and I do n't think I 'm one . But , when the laugh came the third time , I saw his hand begin to shake , till he stuck it in his pocket . The smell of the strawberry shrub was very strong , now  --  stronger than I 've ever smelt it . " Louella Weedon , " said the minister , patiently , " I charge you by the dreadful day when all secrets shall be unlocked  --  " But , right then , I put my oar in . I did n't want to , but it came over me , all of a sudden , that things were n't to be done that way  --  at least not yet . " Excuse me , Minister Henderson , " I said . " But  --  well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I said a word . " I did n't raise my head any  --  I just kept looking at the lampshade , but all the same , I knew there was something in the room . " You see , it 's this way , Louella , " I said . " We aim to be reasonable and we do n't mean to interfere in what 's not our business . But , all the same  --  well , to put it plainly , ca n't you let the boy go ? " There was n't any answer to that , just the echo of my own voice , so I tried again . " All right , " I said . " I wo n't even mention Monroe here .   But , as I figure it , these things happen when a spirit wants something done that has n't been done on earth . Or so they say . So , if you 'd just tell us , Louella , what you want and how we could fix it  --  well , after all , we 're your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd made my point . Then the laugh began and , with the laugh , the voice . " Want ? " it said . " Why , what more could I want ? I 'm back in my house where I always lived  --  I walk in my garden , evenings  --  Ido n't even have to go to the post office to know the town gossip . And I 've a fine handsome young man to call on me once a week and hand me my sewing basket . What more could I want  --  and me a New England woman ? What more could Louella Wecdon want out of life and death ? " I did n't dare look around but I heard Ed Parsons give a sort of reproving " Tch-tch " between his teeth . And the voice went on , very still and clear . " Do n't cross me , Ed Parsons . " it said . " Do you want me to tell them what you keep in the second drawer of your desk at the bank  --  the one with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Ed Parsons , quite loud , and the red came up to his ears . " Then do n't cross me , " said the voice . " And you , Robert Henderson , minister of God . Shall I go back fifty years in the past and tell these men , who sat under you , what was in that past ? " " My child , " said the minister , tranquilly , " if there was sin in my youth , it is between my God and me , now . You can not make it bitterer in the mouth nor the repentance more anguished . So speak , if you will . " " No , " said the voice . " I 've heard tales enough in this village  --  talesenough . And , as for you , Cy Marshall , well , you always were a meddlesome old busybody and you ai n't changed a mite , " said the voice , with venom . " So you know what I think of you all . " P279I kept on looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's throat . Then the minister spoke . " If you are an unclean spirit , " he said steadily , " I charge you , by the words of the Gospel , to begone to your own place . But , if you are otherwise  --  " He had risen now , and his hand was lifted . They talk about the spirit of God being in a man . I guess it was in him , then . For after a long moment , the voice came again , and it was n't rich or mocking but low and sort of pitiful . " I am not an unclean spirit , " it said . " But I am perplexed and bound . I wanted so much . I wanted so much to be gay  --  and I never could be . I bought the clothes to be gay  --  and I never wore them . I wanted love and warm things . Is it wrong to have wanted them ? " " No , my child , " said the minister , gently . " And you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now you must have rest . " " There were so many tongues , " said the voice . " All gossiping . They made an old maid out of me while I was still young . It happens a lot , I guess . It was my fault , too . I used to cut pictures out of the papers  --  pictures of ladies in fine dresses . I always wanted a gold chess  --  1 always wanted gold slippers . Well , folks would have thought I was crazy . But I got them all the same and hid them in tie closet . Because they meant everything I 'd missed . If I 'd worn thew , once , I 'd feel different . But nobody knows about them . So what 's a woman to do ? " " My child , " said the minister and hesitated , " my child  --  " And then there was another voice iii the room . ' We had n't heard the door open  --  we had n't heard anyone come in . But Jean Moffat was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for longer than we knew . " Oh , you big , stupid lumps of men ! " she said . " Ca n't you see what 's keeping her restless  --  ca n't you see what sheP280wants ? As if any woman would n't mind ! Where 's the key to that closet , Judge Marshall ? " " Jean ! " said Monroe Taylor , hoarsely , but she did n't hear him . She was listening for a moment to a whisper we could n't hear  --  the whisper of a woman , talking to another woman , about things man ca n't understand . I did n't know there was a key in the potpourri bowl , any more than I knew that high china cupboard was just a false front and there was a closet behind it . But Jean Moffat seemed to know . I always said she had gumption . I do n't know what the rest of us expected to see when she opened that closet . Most anything , I guess . But it was just dresses . All kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest style and some went back twenty years . But there was one thing about them all . They came from New York and Paris  --  places like that . And each one would have done for a duchess and not one had ever been worn . Jean Moffat was sort of murmuring over them and talking to them  --  not cool and efficient , now , but a woman , sharing another woman 's trouble . " Oh , so pretty  --  " she said . " So pretty  --  Of course you could n't leave them behind , dear  --  of course you had to come back and wear them . Because you never had , in your lifetime . So that 's all right . But now we know about it and you can rest . " " Rest , " said another voice that was like an echo and , just for a minute , there seemed to be another woman in the room , standing right beside jean Moffat and smiling at her . Of course , it was a trick of the light . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only not the one I knew , not the one that was bound to be an old maid . This one was gay and splendid , black-haired and bare-armed , in a dress that glittered in the lamplight . There were sparkling things on her shoes and a sparkling thing in her hair . P281Then she was n't there any more , and there was just Jean Moffat , crying queer tears as she smoothed the dresses with her hands . Well , that was all there was to it , as far as I know . Though we had a little discussion about the dresses , afterwards . Ed Parsons was all for burning them , but jean Moffat knew better and she got her way . Some of them went to folks that could use them  --  young concert-singers and such that have to make an appearance without much money . And others went to the museum . Jean Moffat figured Louella would be satisfied with that , and she seems to have been . At least the summer people who bought the house have n't complained . They think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not telling . Yes , I guess Louella must be satisfied . That was quite a while ago , of course  --  the Taylor children must be five and three . They 've nice children and their father 's fleshed up a bit  --  lost his looks , some folks think , but jean does n't seem to mind . Just a decent small-town couple  --  you 'd never know what they 'd been through , to look at them . Well , I 'd be liable to doubt it myself . Except for one thing . You see , there was a kind of little notebook in the closet with the dresses . Where Louella put down where she got them and what she paid  --  she would , of course , and , I must say , some of the prices turned nay hair . But there was one dress we could n't find  --  the gold one . Well , I think I know where that is  --  and so does jean Taylor . But I say , let the departed rest . After all , Louella bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants it with her , that 's her business . P282IT w A S not very far from Hilda 's house to John 's house  --  just three and a half streets and a corner  --  and it seemed to the children as if they had always known each other . They were always running back and forth  --  you could hear the light patter of their steps in the street like the patter of rain . Sometimesit was Ililda 's mother who caught them and washed them  --  sometimes it was John 's mother who looked up from her baking to see the door open and the children slip in , quite quietly , plump down on their stools and watch her with eager eyes . John was the elder of the two by about six months  --  he had a merry face , a short nose , and a lively imagination . Hilda had yellow pigtails and round cheeks  --  she looked solemn and healthy but she was a good playmate . They had known each other since they were born and expected to know each other all the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an old town , even for the land , and a pleasant one . It was big enough so that it felt like a town , not just a collection of houses  --  it was small enough so that it was easy to get out beyond it , into the fields . There was the gray old church with its stiff stone angels and the city hall with its carved ceiling , the square with its fountain and its statue to a long-dead hero , the running river and the cemeteryon the hill . Hilda and John knew all of them , as children know , by exploring . They were the provost 's girl and theP283minister 's boy  --  most people knew them and were friendly . It was not hard to be friendly to the children  --  no matter in what part of town you found them , they looked as if they had a good time being alive . Of course , they were not always together . They were part of a whole band of children , running up and down the streets , shouting upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children that streams back and forth to school every schoolday  --  thewreath and garland of children that bring new life to a town . Often Ililda played with other companions , and John too ; neither of them was freakish . Yet there was always something that drew them back towards one another , no matterwhat other friends they had . Even their parents grew used to it  --  and their older brothers and sisters . They did not bother to say " Where 's Hilda ? " or " Where 's John ? " They said " Where 's Hilda and John ? " They were able to console each other , too  --  perhaps that was part of it . Let us take death . That is something which happens and is known . The children knew that it happened and accepted it . Yet when old Ketty died  --  old Kctty who worked at the provost 's house they were puzzled . Old Kctty , with her gouty fingers and her cross kindness , was as much a part of their lives as tic house or the lamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon itt the sky . She was not as important as sonic t kings , she W ; IS more important than others . Now she lay in her coffin , with her hands crossed over her breast and her hair very smooth . She looked more importantthat way , but she was no longer Ketty . The children . went to the funeral together 111 ( 1 saw her buried . Afterwards , Hilda 's mother gave them both a piece of ginger-cake , absentmindedly , and sent them out to play . It was good cake and it had a good taste but it did not quite make up for something  --  for what , the children did not know . They played for a while quite cheerfully at being dead like284 The Last Circle The Land Where There Is No Death 285P284Ketty , first John and then Hilda . But there was not much fun in the game , and inside them there was a queer feeling . After a while , they gave it up and sat down on a stone bench by the fountain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven by now , " said Hilda in a matter-of-fact voice . " I guess she started as soon as they put her in the ground . Is that when they start , John ? " " Oh , yes , " said John , who was the minister 's son . " I guess that 's when they start . They could n't start before , with peoplecoming in to see them . I wish I 'd seen her start , old Ketty ! " and he smiled at the thought of old Ketty somehow hurrying and grumbling her way to the door of heaven as she used to hurry , grumbling , to answer the provost 's door . " She had on her best dress , too , " he said . " That was nice for her . " " Yes , I 'd like to have my best dress , " said Hilda . " It does n't matter so much , with boys . " " No , I suppose it does n't , " said John agreeably . He kicked at the bench . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel dead , Hilda ? " Hilda considered . " No , " she said , " I felt funny but I did n't feel dead . " " Neither did I , " said John . " I wish I 'd asked Ketty how it felt . Now you be Ketty , and I 'll ask you . " So Hilda was Ketty , and when he asked her how it felt to be dead , she said it felt very pleasant . Then she burst into tears . " For goodness ' sake , what are you crying about ? " said John . " I do n't believe it feels very pleasant , " said Hilda , overpoweredwith grief . " I do n't want to be dead myself . I do n't want anybody to be dead . " " That 's silly , " said John . " Everybody 's got to be dead some time . " But he was moved and made uncomfortable by her tears .   " Everybody does n't have to be dead , " said Hilda . " Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all right , " said John , since he was older . " Everybody does n't have to be dead . " She sat bolt upright , her round cheeks blazing . " Do you mean that , John ? " " Oh  --  I thought everybody knew that , " said John uncomfortably . " And you 're not just talking about heaven ? I know about heaven . " " No , I 'm not talking about heaven . I 'm talking about  --  " He paused and thought . " I 'm talking about the land where there is no death , " he said firmly . The tears were not dry on Hilda 's cheeks , but she stopped crying . She fished out a bit of barley sugar from her pocket and sucked on it . " Tell me about it , John , " she said , reassured . So he told her about the land where there is no death . It was far away , of course , over many roads and mountains , but it could be readied and found . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damp like heaven but green and sunny . As he told about it , he began to believe in if himself and to sec it plainly . It was very like the best of all that they knew  --  the friendlinessof the town and the warmth of the fields in summer  --  except that no creature died there , not even a hare . When he had quite finished , final 's tears were dry . " It sounds wonderful , John , " she said . " But we wo n't have to go there right away , will we ? I promised Mother to help her with the ironing tomorrow . " " No , " said John . " We wo n't have to go there right away . But we shall go sonic time , of course . " He felt that he had spoken sensibly , and Hilda was content , for she liked to have things definite and in order . After that , they had a secret  --  and it was another bond between them .   That is how they first heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time it occupied their thoughts . Each day when they met , they would add one detail or another to the picture they had of it until it grew very real to them indeed . There were a town and valley , there were streams and forests . They knew it foot by foot , as they knew the streets of their town-and it was a comfort and a consolation to them . As the children grew older , of course , the land receded farther and farther to the backs of their minds . They would talk of it now and then to one another , half in jest , but it was riot a pressing concern . Nevertheless , what is bred in the bone will come out in the flesh . And though Hilda had been the first to raise the question , it was John whose life was changed by it . It came upon him while he was in the last year of his studies for the ministry  --  for , with all his merry looks , a minister he intended to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes will  --  that is hard to say . But at all events , one summer evening he lifted his eyes from the dry page and there it was before him  --  the land where there is no death , with its wide summer fields and forests and its garland of ageless children who pass continually through the streets of its town . The sound of its streams was in his ears like a calling of voices . He knew that it was but a vision and yet it called to him . Surely , somewhere on earth there must be a land that death did not ravage . He put the text aside and sat by the open window for a long time , with his hand upon his brow . So when he came before his examiners , they cast him out  --  for he could not reconcile the goodness of God with the fact that death was loose in the world . He did not complain of their judgment  --  he had expected no less and no more . For that matter , they treated him kindly enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heretic . But his heart was unsatisfiedP287by the texts , and he knew that he must go forth and seek what he must seek . It was hard to do so indeed for by now he was a young man and Hilda a maiden . They had not spoken of love to each other and yet they had taken for granted in their hearts that some time between them there would be love and marriage and the kindly and mortal things . Yet , when they parted at the crossroads , they were gay enough . " It will not be for long , " said John . " Perhaps I shall find it in a month  --  perhaps in a year . Yet surely I shall find it . We have talked of it so often . And that will be a great thing , Hilda . " " That is true , " said Hilda . " And I will not stop your going . Yet the world is very wide . You will not forget me , John ? Not even in that land ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might . go together ! But that , I know , may not be . But when I have found what I must seek , I shall come back to you . " " I will be waiting for you , John . " Then she gave biro bread for his journey , for he had forgotten that iii the exhilaration of his thoughts , and with kisses and sighs they parted as many have parted iii this world . how many the partings arc ! And John took his staff in his hand and Hilda went hack to the town , for it was baking day and the rest of her loaves should 1 aye Leon in the oven an hour ago . Nor will bread bake itself , though folk go on journeys . So John set forth upon his search and it was not a hard journey , at first . He had lived in one town all his life but , being friendly himself , he ' found t lie wide world friendly and of passionate interest . The look of each new village was enough to divert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleasure . Moreover , where his search was concerned , there he got continual encouragement . For whenever he spoke of what he was seeking , soberly and honestly ,  | with that charm youth does not know it possesses until it has gone , there were those who would listen and reply . Sure enough , they had heard of such a land  --  or their fathers had . It was not where they lived and died , as John must understand , but it might lie just beyond the mountains  --  perhaps a little farther  --  that was hard to tell . But there was a tale and a memory of it in men 's minds  --  let John talk to the schoolmasteror the tavern-keeper or old Agnes , the wise woman , who remembered all the old stories . This excited John and made him wonder why they had not sought for the land themselves . But for that there was always a good answer . This man had his field to plow or the village would get no grain  --  that man had just been wed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gladly , were life better arranged  --  as it was , he must sec that they could not  --  but once he had found the land , he must be sure to send them word . And this John promised gladly , for they were kind people and helpful . Nor could he force them to come with him , though now and then he would have been glad of company on the road . Here and there , of course , there were those who thought him a fool or a madman . But he had an even temper and was able to bear their scorn . If they threw him in jail , there was something to be learned in jail  --  if they drove him out of the village , he went from it uncomplaining . He had no quarrel with them  --  only with death . Soon enough , the money in his purse was gone and he must turn to a trade to keep on with his journey . But he was strong of body and clever of hand  --  he would do a day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . Moreover , he found very early that a story or a song often smooths the road for a stranger . They were not hard for him to furnish  --  be had told so many stories to Hilda when they were children that his tongue was quite in the way of it . When the day 's work wasP289done , the folk would gather about him to listen  --  or , if not the grown folk , the children , and that suited John even better . At first he had but a small enough stock of stories but as time went on and he saw more of the world , it grew larger , and he told them with more art . Some were real and of things that had happened , some were the old tales all men tell , some came into his head as he walked along the roads . He could not tell which sort were the best , though he came to know which pleased one town and which another . Yet , in all this time he did not forget the object of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was continually in his mind , for wherever he went , death ravaged the fields of man . And from death none was exempt , no folk and no nation . It seemed to him once that surely the rich and the proud must have among their treasures some clue to his searchings . So he stayed for nearly a year at a king 's court , telling his stories , and the king was well pleased with him . But when the king 's son died in the bloom of his youth , there was nought to do . He could ease the king 's heart a little by his tales , but that was all . At another time he sought out the scholars  --  and the wisest of them were most wise . But wise as they were , they could tell him little of the land lie sought , though they dragged out many rolls of parchment . For one said that such a land was mentioned iii Aristotle the Greek , but another said than it was not , and then there were fierce and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do to calm their quarrel with a story  --  and he left them in the end , happily picking his story to pieces , as men pick bones from a fish . Now he was no longer young , but a man in his prime ; yet the anguish of his search burned in him more fiercely than ever . It drove him across seas and continents , into strange lands , among strange folk . Yet , when he came to know them , they were no longer strange but all children of men . They might live on a bowl of rice under burning suns  --  they might hunt the elk through the snows  --  yet they lived and loved and suffered as all men do . Often they broke his heart with their slyness and their kindness , their cruelty and their strange courage , their hate and their sudden brotherhood . IIe saw great wars flame and cease and the plow go back to the fields  --  he saw bitter injustice done and yet a few men stand against it , and out of their bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of many he made stories and some were bitter . It is bitter to see man blacken the face of man  --  it is bitter to see him die when he might live . Sometimes it was so bitter to John that it seemed to him that , wherever he went , Death himself followed at his heels , a leering companion , shaking his sides at his endless jest upon man . Then John would brace his heart and put himself in Death 's way  --  but , in plague and famine and conflict , Death passed him by . So he went on . He went on because , even in the far corners of the earth and the huts of the savage , he would find a hint and a clue and a memory to lead him . Yes , they knew the land he spoke of , though it was many suns away . The great ones had gone there in the past ; some time , when the great ones came back , all earth would be like that land . And that night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would see its murmuring river and its fragrant fields and its fine town , and , with the dream , his hope would be renewed . You will ask if he thought nothing of Hilda in all these years . He thought of her always and continually  --  sometimes as the child he had played with , sometimes as the maiden he had left . As the years passed , the memory of her face grew dim , yet he knew he would know her in an instant , once he saw her again , and that was a solace to him . Every child to whom he told a story had something of Hilda in its face and , for that reason , he did his best with the stories . " And , asP291soon as my search is ended , I shall see her again , " he thought . His search did not end in a day or a year , yet it ended suddenly . For some time he had noticed a difference and a change in the lands through which he passed  --  the speech was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for very long . As he struggled one day toward a certain pass in the mountains , the felt burning in his heart the certainty that tomorrow would be the day and with it the long task completed . Had they not said in the valley , " Yes , we have heard of the land , and it is not here . But across the mountains , doubtless  --  " The mountain air was thin in his lungs as he toiled upwards with the evening , but his spirits rose . And sure enough , at the very head of the pass , he caught a glimpse of it , all as he had imagined first  --  a fair land with broad fields and bright streams and a good town where men might dwell , all luminous for a moment in the last , golden haze of the sun . Then the sun dipped and the mists of evening shut over it , but John had seen what he had seen . He did not try to go down through the pass that night , for he knew hc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning he roused with the first light and resumed his journey . As the road led toward the town , his excitement mounted , for each stone by the way seemed familiar to him and that was a sure sign . Yet it was not all as lie had dreamt of it but in some ways changed , and that gave hint assurance , too . Ile noticed that folk looked at hint a little oddly as he strode into the town itself , with his ragged cloak around him and his worn staff in his hand  --  well , that was to be expected when one entered the land where there is no death . He did not stop to converse with them or ask questions  --  that would be for later . First of all , he must go to a certain part of the town and sit upon a bench by a fountain . He did not know why he must do this , but it was strong upon him . They were busy with their own affairs , the good people  --    he passed among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housewife came back from market and , all of a sudden , the bells rang and the children burst out of school . How merry they were and lively ! He would find the ones who liked stories best later on . So , at last , he came to the square and the stone bench and the fountain . There was a young girl by the fountain , and as she heard his footsteps , she turned and his heart gave a leap within him , for it was Hilda . He paused for an instant , leaning upon his staff . " Well , Hilda , " he said . " I have found it , as you see . And yet we are together , after all . " Then he saw her eyes change with surprise and knew that it was not Hilda , though very like her . And , with that , his years came upon him and he sank upon the bench . He could see in the waters of the fountain that his hair was as white as snow and his face the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was and what had happened and that he was mistaken indeed . How long he sat upon the bench he did not know , but after a while he looked up , and Hilda was indeed before him , though not the young Kilda he remembered . Her hair was as white as his own . Yet he knew her at once . " Well , John , " she said . " It is good to see you again . And have you no word for an old playmate ? " " I have many words indeed , Hilda , " said John very bitterly . " But they all come down to the one  --  that I have been a fool . You were right not to wait for me , Hilda  --  my search has lasted all my life and yet it has been but a wild-goose chase and brought me back to my front door . And now , at the end of it , I have not even children to match with yours . " " Why , it is not quite like that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that can be . And yet I have alwayswaited for you , John . " P293She sat down on the bench beside him and took his hand . " You must come home with me and tell me of your travels , " she said . " For even in this quiet place , we know your name , and all children know your stories . " " Some of them arc not badly made , " said John . " And yet I set out to find the land where there is no death and not to tell stories to children . " I le looked at her intently . " have you heard that perhaps one or two of them were not so badly made ? " he said . " I know them all , " said IIilda . " Or as many as my children would tell me  --  no doubt you have more . There was one that you told about old Ketty . You gave her another name but I knew old Ketty at once . " " Yes , that was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a bad story , though I always meant to mend it a little . But the children liked it as it was . " He sighed . " And now I must tell my last story , " he said . " I must tell that there is no land where there is no death and that men 's hopes are in vain . That will be a hard story to toll , but it must be told . Yet first I would like to look around the town . It has been so long . " " The house where your fa t her lived st ill stands , " said I Iilda . " It is town property , but I think the town might grant it to a famous teller of stories . My second daughter 's husband now being provost  --  " slit said . So that was how , after all his journeyings , John came back to his own house again - and matters worked out for him much as Hilda had said . Indeed , at t ivies he was almost happy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had heard from other mouths , there were many they did not know , and that is always pleasant for a storyteller . And even the old tales , he found , gained a certain new life from the faces of the listening children  --  the children not of his loins and yet of his town . They were in and out of his house and Hilda 's house all the time  --  they slipped in quietly when he sat by the fire and had slid upon stools to listen before he knew they were there  --  you could hear their footsteps in the street like the patter of rain . Now and then there would be two with their heads together , and John and Hilda would look upon them and smile . Yet when the dark fit came upon him , John would swear that he must set out upon his travels again and tell his last story  --  the story that no land exists where there is no death and that death , not life , rules all things . Nor did Hilda attempt to dissuade him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , the words would not come . He could tell of his own search and his own folly , but that was not enough . " Indeed , I think I have lost what little wits I had , Hilda , " he said to her one day , in anger with himself , as they walked by the river . " For here is a story worth any man 's telling and yet it will not come to my mouth . " " It is a grim story , " said Hilda . " It is a true story , " he said . " Are you sure it is true ? " she said , and he looked at his old companion with anger and surprise . " Have I traveled the world for nothing ? " he said . " What do you know of all this  --  you who sat at home ? " " It is true that I did not go with you and true that I am neither traveler nor taleteller , " said Hilda . " And yet I have my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found your land , but there are the faces and the bodies of my children . For even though they die before me , I have put life into the world , and though all come to dust in the end , there shall yet be dust of that dust . So I say life rules all , not death . " " You talk like a woman , and they are always bound to have the last word , " said John angrily , and flung away from her , for he was annoyed at her crossing him when she was not a taleteller . Yet her words sank into his mind and remainedP295there as he walked further on down the stream , striking at the reeds with his staff . " Now I wish I could talk to Death himself about this , " said John . " For I have neither chick nor child , but only stories . And there arc many with neither child nor story . " And , even as he argued with himself , his story began to take shape in his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For it showed how vain were the dreams and hopes of men for a land where there is no death  --  and how , from the cradle itself , behind every man and woman , followed death , a leering companion , at all times ready to play his one monotonous jest . He came to the king and the beggar , and neither might nor humility could ward him away  --  he touched the strong man in his strength and the fair maiden in her bloom  --  he tumbled knights from their horses and children from their desks at school . Neither pulpitnor pew was exempt from him ; he was there in the crowd at the fair and the roar of battle and the silence of the hermit 's cell . Men might cry out against him manfully  --  they might pray and supplicate and dream  --  it all came to one in the end , and the end was dust . Nay , the world itself , when it was old , he would destroy in time , having fed his bad heart first with every creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun rise and the moon rise and the sky show its spangled stars  --  death was iii the air and the earth and the waters under the earth  --  death everywhere , omnipresent , a king of terrors ruling a world of dupes and slaves . John rolled the words on his tongue , and they were fine words . Let it be his last talc  --  yet it was truth and his best . He could sec the faces grow white as lie told it out and he shivered as the wind came raw from the river . " And yet , that is only Death 's story , " he said to himself . Then he thought of the ways of life  --  not of any one way of it , but of life itself  --  and how it is renewed each year
