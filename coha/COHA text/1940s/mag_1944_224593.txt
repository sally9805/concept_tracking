" The way ... to obtain an international organization is to set about its actual construction , and not merely to talk about it . " So said Sumner Welles , addressing the New York Times Forum last week . <P> Too Little , Too Slow . In his first speech in seven months - and one of the most thoughtful of his many able addresses - the former Under Secretary of State began by drawing two lessons from World War I. He was sure U.S. citizens had learned one of them well - that the question of American entry into an inter national organization must not be permitted to become a question of party politics . But he suggested that the U.S. had not learned an equally important lesson : that the chances of founding such an organization were far greater if the foundations were laid before rather than after the end of the war . Said Diplomatist Sumner Welles : " The Moscow Declaration should have been inseparably linked to an additional declaration setting up an agency , representative of all the United Nations . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay in setting up a council of all the United Nations : isolationism , in its earlier form , he said , is dead . But the longer a genuine , effective internationalism is put off , the more U.S. citizens will believe that a Big Four military alliance is the only hope for security . All such military alliances , he warned , sooner or later disintegrate into a grapple and grab among allies . Already responsible U.S. Government officials are talking imperialistically about keeping the bases the U.S. has leased from Britain or won by force of arms in the Pacific and Africa . The future Welles sees for the U.S. , if a United Nations council is not set up in time : " Unremitting armaments building , territorial aggrandizement ... and their inevitable adjunct , stark imperialism . . . . That road leads only to the Third World War . " <P> The Welles speech took on additional significance as there came a fresh indication that establishment of a United Nations council is far from No. 1 on the **26;9069;TOOLONG agenda . This week , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was decided at Teheran , predicted : " The first move-presumably a general assembly of the United Nations to agree on the broad outline of the world society-may be expected to follow , not precede a successful Anglo-American invasion . " <P> One day after Welles 's speech , another old friend of the President spoke his forebodings about U.S. foreign policy . Said Librarian of Congress Archibald MacLeish , addressing the National Institute of Arts and Letters in New York City : " The peace we seem to be making will be a peace of oil , a peace of gold , a peace of shipping-a peace , in brief , of factual situations , a peace without moral purpose or human intent , a peace of dicker and trade about the facts of commerce , the facts of banking , the facts of transportation , which will lead us where the treaties made by dicker and trade have always led.
