While Congress debated the military assistance program , the final outlines of MAP had gradually taken shape in half a dozen-looseleaf notebooks in a second-floor office of the State Department . There , listed item by item , with the quantity and price of each , were precise allocations of military arms to each MAP country . Last week MAP planners combed through the notebooks and cut out $160 million worth of low-priority items to fit the $1 billion program authorized by Congress for the Atlantic Treaty nations . <P> The schedules of military arms to be furnished by the U.S. had already undergone many a revision . Original requests from Western European countries had simply listed what each country felt it needed . The requests had been carefully screened and trimmed down to size by the Joint Chiefs of Staff . Then a committee of State , Defense and EGA officials had worked out the all but final figures . <P> <P> Rifles to B-29s . In rough outline , France , as the major landpower , was expected to get the bulk of ground equipment - tanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . France would also get some tactical aircraft . But the major share of planes would go to Britain , including every type from trainers to 6-173 and 6-298 . Benelux countries would get the same sort of equipment as France , but less of it . Norway , closest to Russia , would get radar equipment and some army supplies . Denmark would be given antiaircraft guns and radar for the defense of her air bases . Italy , her armament limited by treaty , would get little more than rifles . Most MAP countries needed ( and would get ) minelayers , minesweepers and harbor-defense equipment . <P> The supplies would be drawn , in approximately equal parts , from three sources . Such items as trucks , anti-tank guns and radar equipment would have to be built ( and paid for at current costs ) . Jeeps , rifles , ammunition , some types of artillery , and destroyer escorts ( the largest ships to be sent to Europe under MAP ) , would come from the armed forces reserves , established after the war . They would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items would come from excess stocks . <P> By Thanksgiving ? U.S. excess stocks were plentiful , if badly out of balance . The U.S. had plenty of antiaircraft guns ( many of them without fire-control equipment or prime movers ) . It had thousands of 81-mm. mortars , a good many excess tanks ( needing guns and radios before shipment ) , 155-mm. howitzers , scout cars , machine guns and military radios . In all , some $450 million worth of excess materiel was scheduled for Western Europe 's armies . Only the cost of rehabilitation-estimated at $77 million-would be charged to MAP . <P> There were still some details to complete before MAP supplies started flowing abroad . Congress had yet to appropriate the money which it had authorized . The North Atlantic defense council had to approve its integrated defense plan and each nation had to sign agreements promising not to sell or transfer MAP arms without U.S. permission . MAP did not even have a director-ex-Ambassador James Bruce had not yet been officially nominated by the President . But MAP planners hoped to ship the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Thanksgiving .
