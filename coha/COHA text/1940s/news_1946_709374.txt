txt Plans for a new State Prison at Bridgewater , built over a long period of years with full utilization of prison labor , and for a dormitory-type installation for youthful offenders in another section of Massachusetts . have been approved by the Legislative.Committee on Public Welfare , it was learned today . This new program for Massachusetts ' penal and correctional institutions , discarding the Lewis E. Laves ' recommendation for converting Concord Reformatory into a State Prison , goes next to the Ways and Means Committee for consideration . Preliminary estimates of the appropriation necessary to start work at Bridgewater approximate $200,000 . This would cover the wall and one cell block , as compared with the $2,500,000 , grandiose structure originally urged by J. Paul Doyle , State Cominissioner of Correction . Middle of Road The Committee proposal is regarded as a middle road in the almost universal demand foi ? modernizing the physical plant of the State 's penal and correctional system .

Approval by the Legislature would authorize the immediate : onstrudion of the wall and one : ell block . This follows the plan . ender which Norfolk Prison Col-my , regarded as one of the best 3risons in the country , was begun in 1931 . Prison labor , used to great extent at Norfolk , would be used substantially to complete the Bridgewater Prison . Over Several Years Construction would be spread over several years . This is a concession to those who contend that the proposed appropriation of $2 , - 500,000 , under present material and labor costs , would not finish one-third of the structure originally put forward by Mr. Doyle . By winning approval of the Committee for the beginning of his State Prison at Bridgewater , The Commissioner has largely gained his objective , however . Construction will follow closely the blueprints rolled up on this office table . These call for eventual erection of a prison with accommodations for 840 prisoners , covering 35 acres , and requiring only four guards . Approximately 580 convicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complement of 10 guards . Too Expensive Construction of a 300-cell block and machine - shops at Concord with its conversion as a maximum security detention center , as recommended by Mr. Lawes , was disapproved as too expensive and inadequate by the Committee . Concord , instead , under the new program , will serve as a reception center for all offenders . The approval given to a new minimum security prison for juvenile offenders , although basically in line with the Lawes report , differs in one point . . The former Warden of Sing Sing Penitentiary recommended conversion of a CCC camp for the young prisoners . The Committee , apparently recognizing the need for a permanent installation of this type , voted to indorse the new dormitory-type structures . One of the chief arguments in favor of this move has been the necessity for housing young offenders with the older prisoners at Norfolk , a medium security installation . Both physical limitations and ideal penological theories are regarded as opposed to this practice .               @ @ @ @ @ @
