One of Rio 's flashiest suburbs-Copacabana-has 16,000 empty apartments , and through the city there are thousands of others . But there is also a housing shortage . <P> The reason for this strange state of affairs is that the empty Copacabana apartments , like many others in the great modern buildings that line Rio 's beaches and stalk its hillsides ( TIME , Feb. 25 , 1946 ) , are owned by speculators who have no intention of becoming landlords . Tax laws are on the side of the speculator . The only real-estate tax an owner pays is 10% on rental value , established after an apartment is completed-and a stepladder in an entrance hall is evidence enough that the building is not yet done . <P> How this situation affects apartment-hunters was told this week by TIME Correspondents Bill White and Connie Burwell White : <P> The obvious way to find an apartment is to call a real-estate agent-anywhere but in Rio , that is . Agents here ca n't find apartments and they firmly refuse new business . So you read advertisements , spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After weeks of that sort of searching you become gun-shy . Why ? Because " furnished " apartments are that in name only . <P> Eight miles from our downtown office we saw one that offered for a bed a straw mat covered with an old army blanket . It had no kitchen utensils , dining-room chairs , or light fixtures . It did have a lovely fountain on a vast second-floor terrace . Price : $250 a month . <P> The next step is to try your own advertisement . It must be specific as to your needs , for few apartments have iceboxes or telephones and getting a telephone takes from one to three years . Our ad brought us some leads . The first place we saw was on Avenida Atlantica , hanging right over Copacabana Beach . It was perfect-for midgets . The front room was so small you could light the landlady 's cigaret ( she sat across the room ) without getting up . But size was the least drawback . With the apartment-at $225 a month-went the landlady 's grandmother . Grandma would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a waisthigh , turquoise-blue floor vase , filled with paper calla lilies , and a great brass Russian samovar for decorations . But it had no icebox , no bed linen , no telephone . The price : $250 a month-$750 in advance plus a deposit of $500-which we would probably not get back . Said the perspiring owner , " Sempre tem vento " ( There 's always a breeze ) . " Sempre ? " we asked . " Sempre , " she replied , daintily wiping her forehead . <P> This sort of thing went on for some six weeks and 50 apartments . The cheapest was offered at $225 and the most expensive at $425-four rooms . Often there was a demand for " key money , " say $200 , to speed negotiations . We saw only two apartments that had no dirty dishes in the sink . It was not that the maids were lazy . Rio as usual was suffering from a falta d'agua ( water shortage ) . All but two had a bathtub of rusty water with a saucepan nearby for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . <P> An advertisement in the English-language Brazil Herald brought results . The owner wanted no key money ; he did not want to sell any furniture . For a big living room , dining room , bedroom and tiny guest room we thought it a gift at $300.
