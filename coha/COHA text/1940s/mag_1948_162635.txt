Never had Moscow 's shabby , musty Great Lecture Hall in Polytechnic Plaza been more tightly packed . People who could not find seats sat in each other 's laps or in the aisles . The occasion was a lecture entitled : " Love , Marriage and Family in Socialist Society . " * <P> Behind the turnout there was more than vernal interest in a vernal theme ; there was also the Muscovites ' incessant quest for the latest twist of the Communist Party 's line . <P> The lecturer , sleek-haired , glib Philosophy Professor V. N. Kolbanovsky , said : " Ugly psychological leftovers of bourgeois ideology concerning marriage and love still exist here . . . . Bourgeois marriages are business marriages where love gets dirtied and trampled . ... In bourgeois countries the working girl , in order to get and hold a job , often has to pass through the boss 's bed . ... In the bourgeois state children are not wanted in great numbers . " <P> As the ultimate in horrible examples , he picked Chattanooga , Tenn. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every marriage . This , he added , would soon reult in every woman having been married to every man. * <P> The days of Soviet divorce at a pen-scratch had been ended by 1944 decrees . New laws further restricting divorce are under consideration . Said Kolbanovsky : " The time will never come when parents are reduced to the function of producing children and handing their babies over to the state . . . . Love under Communism will become even more beautiful . " <P> <P> *In the 100 years since Karl Marx 's Communist Manifesto espoused " an open , legalized community of women , " few subjects have been more frequently disputed by Marxists . Lenin , in one of his sharpest departures from Marxism , vehemently rejected " free love " on the ground that " love is more than drinking a glass of water . " But Alexandra Kollontay , who instituted the Soviet system of easy divorce in 1917 , was called " Russia 's only real Communist " because of her advocacy of free love <P> *The facts : in twelve months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorces . At this rate it would take 3,271,152 years for each of Chattanooga 's 51,503 nubile females to marry all of its 45,750 nubile males .
