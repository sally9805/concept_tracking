ONE warm day last May there were many vacant desks in the Chicago public schools , and the truant squad , prepared for the vernal outbreak of waywardness , swung into action . Some officers headed for beaches and amusement parks , but Mrs. Mary Susson , famous for her annual hag of hooky players , hopped an electric train for Jackson Park , where she stalked her prey in a huge building on the shore of Lake Michigan . In a few hours she had nabbed sixty happy vagrants . These children were not feeding juke boxes , reading comics , going swimming or playing gunman . Believe it or not , they were caught red-handed visiting a museum . This remarkable place , which lures both children and parents in vast droves , is the Museum of Science and Industry , the pride of Chicago and the biggest institution of its kind in the world . Despite the official name , " museum " seems hardly appropriate . To most people , a museum is a formidable edifice where serious people in their best clothes look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards . But this one is a carnival of science , a panorama of progress and a multi-ring circus of machines . You can go in your shirt sleeves and take your lunch . You do n't knock your pipe out at the front door . In fourteen acres of floor space MUSEUMS DO N'T HAVE TO BE STUFFY ( Continued front Page 33 ) International Harvester Farm . This is a model farmyard ? the heart of the Midwestern 160-acre farm  --  with full-scale house , barns , milkhouse , silo and outbuildings , equipped with the latest machines , from the freezing unit in the kitchen to the automatic-pickup hay baler and the self-propelled harvester-thresher , complete with dummy driver , which is frozen in the act of reaping real wheat in the seemingly endless field beyond the barn . You come to the spotless stable where the champion mulch cows live . A Holstein stands contentedly while her foamy milk is mechanically drawn into a glass tank . She flips an ear , switches her tail and gently moos . But when you pat her , she echoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels and such , and the milk is strictly synthetic . She has a bald spot on her flank where thousands of curious visitors before you have made the same discovery . Did you ever go down into a coal mine ? Coal is one of the main bulwarks ofourlives , and 484,600 Americansearn their living mining it , yet few people know what it 's like to descend into a - dank subterranean cavern and dig out the black fuel . The museum 's full-size working coal mine is one of its most popular shows . Complete with mining machinery , rolling stock and real coal , it has been sunk deep in the ground at the rear of the building . Visitors are greeted at the shaft head by a grimy miner with hard helmet and safety lamp . They are packed into the cage of an actual mine elevator and are dispatched on a perpendicular journey to the mine level , a simulated 600 feet below . You think of increased pressure as the walls shoot past you , and your ears seem to ring , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belts spinning upward , that the cage crawls downward slowly , and that when you think you 're at the earth 's core you are only a few feet below street level . You emerge at the shaft bottom into the musty odor of coal diggings and the deafening din of the pumps and the rotary dump which is unloading pit cars from the workings . Real seams of bituminous coal from Southern Illinois were ingeniously transplanted for this full-size demonstration , and everything is authentic , including the miners , who are veterans of the pits . After leaving the underground gloom , you can , if you wish , stroll down a gas-lit village Main Street of 1910 , with granite-block pavement , watering trough , electric broughams and gas buggies parked at the curb ; elegant dry-goods shops with Gibson-girl corsets , ankle-length dresses and derby hats ; a caf ? advertising ham and eggs for twenty-five cents , and a bunting-decked platform where someone is to speak on Votes for Women . A nickelodeon at the end of the street emits a tinny piano tinkle . Pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk in . Maybe you 'll catch The Great Train Robbery , or it might be Texas Trail Treachery , Only a Farmer 's Daughter , or Mary Pickford in The New York Hat . Whatever else you see or skip , you always go to the nickelodeon . This little theater , which seats 164 , puts on some twenty-two performances a day . It 's one of the few theaters in the world which show nothing but primitive flickers , and it 's probably theonly five-cent movie house left in the United States . If you still feel nostalgic , you can walk into The Home exhibit , sink on a soft lounge , and gaze upon a series of full-sized replicas of the great American living room , showing what the mythical Middleton family considered smart during the period bracketed by the unveiling of the Statue of Liberty , in 1886 , to the Lindbergh flight in 1927 .

The exhibit is sponsored by Sears , Roebuck and Company , but in keeping with the rigid rules of the museum , there is nothing for sale and there is no conspicuous advertising . The people in these period rooms would topple over and require medication if they were alive to see the mosttalked-about exhibit in the entire museum . This is The Miracle of Growth , complete visual exposition of the process of human conception and birth , prepared for the museum by the Chicago professional colleges of the University of Illinois . This exhibit shoots the works without evasion , and any male or female from six to eighty can walk in and find a simple , accurate , ( Con i fled on Page 90 ) 90 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 15,1919 ( Continued from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long concealed by society as an indelicate mystery . All visitors stop in their tracks , some of them gasp and a few faint as they enter the hall and gaze at the spectacular symbol of the exhibit . R is a figure in transparent plastic of a life-size pregnant woman , carrying a full-term fetus ready for birth , and showing many pertinent anatomical details . This plastic lady , called " Beulah " by the staff , sets the tone of the exhibit , and there are no gasps after the first impact . The line of spectators follows a long series of wall panels , on which plaster reproductions of the interior reproductive organs , accompanied by text , describe the significance of adolescence , set forth the function of the sperm and the ovum , explain conception , and show models of the unborn child in the various stages of pregnancy . The mechanics of birth , both normal and Caesarean , are then shown , and other panels deal with the care of young children , the growth of teeth , height and weight , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a man who guesses weight , and in the heredity exhibit you see young couples pressing buttons , while flashing lights show them what the harvest is likely to be when a brown-haired man marries a redhead , or what have you . If this show is an eye opener to the unprepared visitor , the attitude of the crowd is even more arresting . Elsewhere in the museum there is a babble of talk and laughter  --  when people enter the Miracle exhibit they lower their voices . Not shame but respect moves them . On a May Sunday I saw thousands of visitors of all ages waiting in line to file slowly through the hall . Firm. - ily groups predominated . Grade-school boys and girls , matter-of-fact and unsniggering , thoughtfully studied the panels and pointed things out to their parents . Women obviously with child proudly identified their stage of progress and told their friends about it .

These are only a few of the exhibits . All together , there are 200 , all designed for easy , informal teaching . You wonder how long this has been going on and who planned it . As museums go , it is very young . It has been open in approximately its present form for only eight years . But you can trace its origin to a trip to Munich in 1920 by the late Julius Rosenwald , then president of Sears , Roebuck and Company , and his son William . They spent many hours in the Deutsches Museum , which , before its partial destruction in the recent war , was the world 's largest and greatest museum devoted to science and its practical utilization . Impressed by his son 's eager interest , Mr. Rosenwald returned to Chicago convinced that his city should have a similar institution devoted to public education . He put the matter up to the civic-minded Commercial Club of Chicago , which acted as midwife . The old Fine Arts Building , of magnificent size and classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1893 , had recently been vacated by the Field Museum . While the heavy walls were solid , the ornamental plaster exterior was crumbling , and it was proposed that it be restored to its original state in Indiana limestone  --  Greek columns , statuary and all . The South Park district voted a $5,000,000 bond issue for the job , and Mr. Rosenwald contributed $3,000,000 . Later gifts from him and his family boosted the Rosenwald contribution to $7,000,000 . In 1933 the museum was opened , but the few exhibits were lost in the fourteen acres of floor space , and it was far from fulfilling the dream of its creator . Nine years ago the museum faced a crisis . As a philanthropist , Mr. Rosenwald did not believe in heavily endowed institutions . He thought each generation should pass its own hat . For instance , back in 1917 he set up the Julius Rosenwald Fund to improve racial relations . Last June , after spending the last cent of its $22,500,000 , the fund closed its books and locked the door . So , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the operating burden to posterity . In 1939 the partially opened museum was struggling to meet an annual bill of about $300,000 with an income from all sources of around $200,000 . Result , to quote Mr. Micawber : misery . Rufus C. Dawes , former president of A Century of Progress  --  Chicago 's World 's Fair of 1933 and ' 34 ? was ably tackling the problem when he died of heart failure . The trustees had to find a man . Ideally , he should be a man with a profound respect for science , a practical knowledge of the technical side of industry , a flair for promotion and , most important of all , he should have showmanship in his bones . They found all these things in Maj. Lenox R. Lohr , who had served under Mr. Dawes as vice-president and general manager of the big fair , and later was president of the National Broadcasting Company . Major Lohr , fifty-seven , is a dark , muscular package of energy . His title comes from twelve years of service in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cornell in mechanical engineering . He is an avid collector of early automobiles , old film dramas , slot machines , playing cards , guns , coins , stamps and moths , and his big house in Evanston is a museum in itself . He takes his guests to ride in a two-cylinder 1910 Sears surrey , with a fringe on top and a genuine whip socket on the dash , or in a stately 1906 glass-enclosed electric carriage . Then you 'll do daredevil stunts around the grounds in a little Fiat , and maybe end up in a cellar theater watching ancient slapstick comedies . When Major Lohr was asked to direct a museum , he first thought of moth balls , but he saw no reason why that instinctive association should persist . With a showman 's eye he went around and looked at a few museums . The first thing that impressed him was the large number of men standing outside the doors , smoking . He made a note in his little hook . Then , as he strolled down marble halls , he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He heard children fretting because they were hungry , he heard parents shushing their restless offspring , and he heard guides delivering lifeless spiels they had learned by rote . He saw rows of neat glass cases with neat little placards , and with a few notable exceptions , there was no attempt to bridge the gap between the exhibit and the average spectator  --  to show how these things affected daily life . He also came to realize that total annual attendance was only a partial guide to a museum 's appeal to the public  --  it was equally important to know how long people stayed . When Major Lohr returned to Chicago , bursting with ideas , a few conservatives viewed him as a bull in a china shop and an enemy of the gracious and dignified tradition , but even they knew that something had to be done . First the major took down the No Smoking signs and placed capacious ash trays at convenient spots . He did some road work on the vast expanse of marble flooring of which the architects were so proud . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 93 ) marble is now covered with carpeting or other material easy on the feet , and throughout the building comfortable lounges and benches have been placed near something interesting . For those who crave a longer sit , there are eight theaters , great and small , with a combined seating capacity of more than 1800 , which are in use all or a part of the time , presenting films or demonstrations on subjects like forestry , steel , radar or microbes , lectures by leading scientists and engineers , Sunday-morning organ recitals and dramatic productions given by outside groups . For the hungry , there is a large cafeteria with good food at moderate prices . It has dispensed some 480,000 meals in a year . There is another large dining room for people who bring box lunches , with a counter for coffee , ice cream , and so on . On a busy day , hundreds of children leave their labeled lunch boxes at the main entrance , and find them later in the " picnic room . " Winning the public with these thoughtful small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first step . Next , Lohr had to fill the museum 's great open spaces with arresting , informative shows to lure the thousands to make the trip by train , bus or automobile to a spot six miles from the center of town . And he had to save money at the same time . " We knew that the era of ' angels ' was over , " said the major . " Income and inheritance taxes took care of that . We saw that institutions like ours would have to figure out a method of support from a number of sources . " The most promising source was big industry . Since its origin , the museum 's exhibits have fallen into two categories : the shows demonstrating basic scientific laws , which the museum builds , and the industry-sponsored technological displays , like Santa Fe 's model-railway system , with its miniature roundhouses , freight yards , repair shops and operating block signals and switches . Major Lohr 's campaign met with spectacular success . At present , twenty-five leading industrial corporations are participating with exhibits which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepares its show with the help of the museum 's experts and pays for materials and installation as well as an annual fee to cover heat , light , demonstrators ' salaries and so on . This involves a little skillful tightrope walking . The museum does not sell space , it awards it . Advertising plugs which might compromise the educational mission of the museum are not permitted , but the museum not only allows prominent credit to the firm which sets up the show but insists upon it . The result is that the firm reaps a harvest of prestige advertising by exposing its show to an anticipated 8,000,000 or more science-minded visitors over a five-year period , and if a gadget stops working in the show which bears its name , the firm 's maintenance men come fast and fix it . From the start , Major Lohr has been careful to forestall any fears by educators that the museum would become unduly commercialized . This has become easier as the institution has won world-wide recognition . Its prestige warns would-be exhibitors that it is not a trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program manager , Paul Masaman , once an ace high-pressure salesman for fairs and exhibitions , now calls himself a " low-pressure salesman . " The museum now houses about $5 , - 000,000 worth of industrial exhibits and collects maintenance fees of around $150,000 a year . This covers about a quarter of the running costs . Another 25 per cent comes from the state educational fund . The balance is covered by admissions to the coal mine , the Nickelodeon , the Micro-world Theater , profits from the Arcade where cards and souvenirs are sold , and income from the residue of the Rosenwald gift . Along with solvency came great crowds , pulled in by the fascinating new exhibits and the easygoing atmosphere . Attendance has boomed from less than 650,000 in 1940 to a record-breaking total of 1,366,599 in 1947 . The major 's goal was 3,000,000 for 1948 . The museum can handle them , he says , and he thinks they 'll make it sometime . But what pleases him most is that the average length of visit , as shown by a sampling system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half hours . To hear the major and his staff gloat over those figures , and to see then : check the gate at closing time , you 'd think they were charging the customers $6.60 a head . Leading educators  --  among them Pres. George D. Stoddard , of the University of Illinois , Pres. Henry T. Heald , of the Illinois Institute of 94 TILE SATURDAY EVENING POST January airy 15,1919 Technology , Dean Walter Bartky , of the University of Chicago 's physical-sciences division , and Dr. Herold C. Hunt , Chicago 's general superintendent of schools  --  are enthusiastic about the museum 's fresh , stimulating teaching methods , and foreign teachers from many countries have come to observe . A large proportion of the visitors are grade and high-school pupils . Teachers all over the Midwest are using the museum to supplement science courses , and every day chartered busses roll up to the door from schools in Southern Illinois , Ohio , Indiana , Michigan , Wisconsin , Iowa , Missouri , and sometimes even from Colorado and New York . In 1947 more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day in the great circus of science . These juvenile invasions have never made . discipline a problem . You see kids of all colors , races and home backgrounds merging happily in popeyed exuberance , and their behavior is plenty good enough for children on a holiday . The museum 's few rules are made for the benefit of visitors , not for the convenience of the staff . A long , smooth banister once tempted small fry beyond resistance . No one cared until a boy hurt himself ; then they had to clamp down . A corps of forty alert young demonstrators , most of them college science students earning their way , pilot visitors through the wonderland of machines and exhibits and tell them what it 's all about . They are trained by a slight , wiry New Englander , Harry Orrin Gillet , editor in chief of the THE REFORMER AND THE REDHEAD ( Cant OOOO fr Page 29 ) you 're young and vigorous , yet I ca n't seem to dramatize you . " " What can I do to make myself dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I know it , " Herb agreed . " I 'm still stumped , though . You have to consider the lousy material I 'm working with . " He massaged his head again . " I keep wishing you could foil a holdup or save a little boy from drowning . Sometimes I wonder if we had n't better ? " " No planned stunts , " Andrew said . " I wo n't go for that . " " Of course not , " Herb said . " You wo n't be the new district attorney either . " Presently he went his way , and cigar smoke prevailed over the heady aroma of the wilderness . Andrew doggedly completed his speech . His secretary prepared to type it . Recalling Bridget Maguire and her difficulties , Andrew had the girl make a few telephonic inquiries . Commodore Parker , it developed , was at the yacht club , varnishing his cutter . Aware of a growing sense of compulsion , Andrew decided to skip lunch and start the Maguire investigation immediately . He drove to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the yacht club . A man inside directed him to the slip where the commodore was wielding a brush . The latter was a portly , red-faced man wearing a cap decorated with gold braid . Seated near him on a hatch cover , oiling the parts of a .45-caliber automatic pistol , was his large , gimlet-eyed , sunburned daughter . Andrew gave his name and asked if he might speak with them . American Educator Encyclopedia , who spends his spare time coaching them . They have no spiels . He chooses them for knowledge of their subjects and ability to express themselves , and no demonstrator gets his badge until he passes the Gillet course . There is nothing static about this museum  --  new shows open constantly to keep pace with the unfolding panorama of science and technology . A dozen exhibits are now in the planning and rehearsal stage . Swift and Company , with the co-operation of a medical group , is planning a child-nutrition demonstration . Crowds will look through one-way glass windows into model nurseries , where real babies will be fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be called The Five Senses , they 're planning , among other things , a room with slanting walls to show how an optical illusion can upset your balance . Lights , color and motion will dramatize the cancer menace in another show , to be put on by the American Cancer Society . A petroleum exhibit will have a big transparent pipe carrying a bubbling liquid , which will act as traffic guide to lead the visitor from the oil well to the newest refinery devices . Other new exhibits will show how the heart pumps blood , how television works , what a radio tube does , how cotton goods are made and how many times a robot bat has to hit a regulation baseball before the cover is knocked off . " The museum will never be finished , " says Major Lahr , " because what it really is is an animated loose-leaf encyclopedia of science and industry . " " Come aboard , young man , come aboard , " J. B. Parker said . " This is my daughter Lily . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she certainly ought to have been able to lick the diminutive Bridget . " Hi , Hale , " Lily said . " Did you ever go out beyond the breakwater , trail a chunk of meat on a hook and shoot sharks ? " " No , I did n't , " Andrew replied . " It 's great fun , " Lily said . " They go crazy when they 're hit . They even eat each other . It 's a real rat race . " The commodore appeared pleased . " Lily is developing into quite a tomboy , " he said .... " Mr. Hale , if you 've come here to speak on behalf of your candidacy , you need n't bother . " " No , I ? " Andrew began . " I 'm for you and the reform group one hundred per cent , " J. B.

" I have been given the impression , " he said , " that you intend to take some form of action against my client . " " So you 're her mouthpiece , huh ? " the commodore said . " Very interesting . " " Also , " Andrew continued unhappily , " I understand you are attempting to have my client 's father ousted as head of the zoo . I must plead with you
