The Drive to Raise Your Rent The mighty real-estate lobby in Washington is doing its very best to put rent control first on the list of price controls to be lifted . We have frequently reported to you what great strength the landlords exert , and how skillfully their highly paid Washington representatives operate . They have done an especially slick job of evading rent control , the latest device being " security deposits . " War workers in some places are being forced to pay large deposits , running as high as $250 , before being permitted to rent quarters . The OPA has ruled this practice illegal , but it is reported to persist . The CIO has taken the lead in exposing this " racket " and deserves the thanks of all tenants thus threatened , for demanding that the OPA stand firm . The Japanese in the Philippines Among the most interesting reports to come from the reconquered sections of the Philippines are those telling of relations between the Filipinos and the Japanese . To be sure , reports of conflict between the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be viewed with some caution ; if your country has been invaded by two successive armies , it is only natural for you to report to the second conqueror that you did not get on at all well with the first . Making full allowance for this fact , however , there seems no doubt that the Japanese bungled their relations with the Filipinos , raising the interesting possibility that they may have done equally badly in other areas such as Malaya , Burma and the Dutch Fast Indies . Recent reliable reports from Java and Sumatra say that the Japanese have used the utmost cruelty . All these territories had been in the control of white men who came long ago as conquerors . In most cases these white men had been extremely inconsiderate of the aspirations of the natives , exploiting them economically and discriminating against them socially . Tho Japanese slogan of " Asia for the Asiatics " could easily have been made to mean a great deal to the brown or yellow-skinned inhabitants of the countries they captured in the early days of the war . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done very little to establish cordial relations , or to identify themselves with the natives as " common victims of white imperialism . " Their rule would appear to have been modeled on the arrogance of the Nazis in Western Europe , where a similar failure has been witnessed . They treated the Filipinos with severity , insisted on the utmost deference to themselves , and subjected the natives to the greatest privations , without , so far as can be learned , any attempt to explain the necessity for this or , by propaganda , to soften the blow . The Japanese , in fact , seem not to be aware of what should be the first rulein the handbook of would-be world conquerors : Learn to get along with the conquered . Russian Roundabout A friend , recently returned from Russia , swears that he overheard the following on the Moscow subway . " I would n't worry about your son , Petrov , " said one well dressed , middle-aged Muscovite to another of the same general description . " I would n't give two kopecks for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our friend had to get off at the next stop , but not before hearing the earnest proletarian continue , consolingly , " He 'll be a good socialist by the time he 's twenty-five . " Nothing has reassured us more as to the fundamental Bolshevism of the Soviet Union . Nomination Nominated for America 's nonhero of the week : The barber in Poston , Arizona , who chased out of his shop a Japanese American war veteran , who was still on crutches because of wounds received while fighting in Italy against Nazi doctrines of racial discrimination . A Correction In The New Republic of December III appeared an article by Helen Fuller , " Shake-up in State , " in the course of which Miss Fuller attributed to Mr. Justice Frankfurter activity in behalf of the nomination of Mr. Archibald MacLeish as one of the new assistant secretaries . We are advised that this report was based on a misunderstanding and that Mr. Justice Frankfurter had nothing to do with the matter .

Broadcasting and other means of communication were largely new matters to Durr , who had passed the time since his years as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford , first in the private practice of the law and later as assistant general counsel of the RFC and general counsel of the Defense Plants Corporation . Now Commissioner Durr is widely known as a high-principled , courageous fighter : against advertising control of radio ; against the lack of radio service for millions of people in that one-third of the United States outside the " daytime service " area ; against unreasonably high prices for the purchase of radio stations , which make it impossible for the little fellow to get in ; for balanced presentation of controversial issues on the air , allowing labor and consumer groups to buy their share of time as easily as do commercial groups ; for developing more local public-service programs ; for an adequate nationwide telephone and telegraph service to readh all citizens .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
