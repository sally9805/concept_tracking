WITCHCRAFT IN ENGLAND ( 163 pp. ) - Christina Hole-Scribner ( $3 ) . <P> <P> " Before Candlemas we went be-east Kinloss , and there we yoked a plough of toads . The Devil held the plough , and John Young , our Officer , did drive the plough . Toads did draw the plough as oxen , couchgrass was the harness and trace-chains , a gelded animal 's horn was the coulter , and a piece of a gelded animal 's horn was the sock ploughshare . " <P> Thus spake the 17th Century 's Isobel Gowdie , a Scots peasant who confessed her practices as a witch in language as fanciful as one of her great contemporaries , Poet Robert Herrick . Isobel ( whom the authorities first hanged , then burned for safe measure ) is one of the highlights of Christina Hole 's scholarly , sober history of English witchcraft. * Her familiarity with it began when her old nurse destroyed her milk teeth as fast as they fell out , to keep them from evil hands . <P> Prominent witches such as Isobel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sorcerers-men &; women who assembled regularly in barren places under the direction of a " Grand Master , " who was usually masked and garbed in animal skins and satanic horns . When the gang had reported on their success or failure as satanic agents since the last meeting and had finished feasting ( usually on a sheep stolen from a farmer ) , the Master took up his reed pipe and led them in a riotous dance , which ended in a sexual orgy lasting " until the first light of dawn broke up the meeting . " <P> Such covens , Author Hole explains , were in essence Christian England 's last , fading traces of pagan religion , stemming from the same roots as the animal sacrifices of the Greeks and the fertility rites of the Egyptians . When King Saul found himself out of favor with his Maker , he turned to the Witch of Endor for advice and succor-and for centuries after King Saul , kings , scholars and peasants alike turned the same way for the same reason . Witches might be good or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic , or a mixture of both ) , but it never occurred even to intelligent Europeans as late as Shakespeare 's day to question their existence . The great Elizabethan savant , Dr. Dee , was as much on the alert for phony witchery as the Roman Catholic Church is for phony miracles , but Dr. Dee used " magic " ( by royal request ) to divine the most propitious day for Queen Elizabeth 's coronation , and spent most of his life peering into a crystal ball and trying to induce the archangels to join him in intellectual disputations . <P> A Witch in Time . Sharp practices , thefts , murders were often promptly confessed by the evildoer when he heard that the local white witch was on his trail . It was this popular , pagan confidence in witchcraft that caused the Church to fear it like the Devil himself . On the European continent , a steady procession of harmless men , women and children went to terrible deaths as witches . In England , where religious problems were less acute , and the authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the record was not so dark . Torture , to extract confessions , was rarely employed , and Author Hole estimates that between the time of Queen Elizabeth and 1736 ( when witchcraft trials became illegal ) , not more than 1,000 witches lost their lives by official decree .
