According to some Christians , all of a man 's life is simply a preparation for " a good death . " Virginia Moore , an Episcopalian , believes that there are fashions in dying and that men die as they live-according to the style of their times . Last week she buttressed this thesis in a macabre treasury of last words ( Ho for Heaven ; Dutton , $3 ) . <P> Eight thousand years ago , says Necrologist Moore , the unknown inhabitants of the Indian peninsula seem to have had no fear of death , regarded earthly life as a kind of spiritual education , death as release for the soul to return home . But from then until the coming of Christ , mankind grew more &; more entangled in material things , and correspondingly loth to leave them . <P> To the early Greeks death was simply an unavoidable calamity . The dead Achilles warned Odysseus that it was better to be a beggar on earth than a king in Hades . Later their philosophers tried to reason with death and strike a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is either annihilation or immortality , " said Socrates . " Either is well . " <P> Two thousand years ago man 's manner of dying was profoundly changed by the greatest of valedictories : " Father , into thy hands I commend my spirit . " <P> Faith and Flair . Combined with the deep faith that grew in the Middle Ages , the flair of the Renaissance for zestful living produced men whose deaths were proud as well as pious . Mounting the scaffold , Sir Thomas More joked : " I pray thee , Mr. Lieutenant , see me safe up , and for my coming down , let me shift for myself . " <P> In the 18th Century death seemed " selfconscious . . . with . . . eyes less on God than on the bystanders . " When the priest rose to leave Mme. Pompadour 's bedside , she stopped him . " One moment , M. le Cur , " she said , " and we will depart together . " Cracked Voltaire , when a lamp flared in his death chamber : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's funeral customs , says Author Moore , are a barometer of its belief about death . U.S. customs ( and , by implication , belief ) got a lashing last week from the Rev. Josiah R. Bartlett of Seattle 's University Unitarian Church . Said he : <P> " . . . Under the pressure of materialism and advertising and salesmanship , America 's funerals have , within the past fifty years , degenerated into a pagan preoccupation with vulgar display and pagan concern for the body , to the almost total neglect of the spirit . . . . <P> " First of all we can blame our popular religion . . . . Next . . . our own popular bad taste . . . . But . . . the funeral industry itself is most to blame . . . . "
