For 20 years the matronly , broad-beamed old sidewheeler Seeandbee made the night run between Cleveland and Buffalo , and a pretty thing she was . She was fast too : 20 to 21 knots . She had passenger accommodations for 2,300 , reportedly cost $1,500,000 . <P> In 1933 the Seeandbee went into cruise service , on a run that was the poor man 's seven-day dream-tour of the Lakes . While she was quietly aging at Cleveland 's East 9th Street Pier , the U.S. Navy took a look at her shallow draft , her gangling length ( 484.5 feet , overall ) , decided that with a little face-lifting and some new glands , she would do as a remodeled carrier . Her four stacks could be moved to one side , her upper deck and superstructure torn away . The old crone would become a Valkyrie . Before summer 's end , said the Navy , Navy flyers on the Great Lakes will get carrier training on the waddling old dreamboat.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
