Britain 's Labor Government this week proposed a revolutionary act-in its implications the most sweeping act since the Soviet Government 's decree of forced collectivization of the peasants ( 1929 ) . It was the " Town &; Country Planning Bill , 1947 " drawn up by Lewis Silkin , Minister of Town &; Country Planning . <P> <P> Accompanying the bill was a White Paper . <P> Three weeks earlier the Government had published its sweeping , rigorous Farm Control Bill . With these measures-certain to be hotly debated and as certain to be passed-owners and users of Britain 's land and everything " in , on , under or over the land " knew what they were up against , and it was plenty . Hereafter , a great saying fraught with the British instinct for freedom would read : " An Englishman 's home is his Government 's . " Planners had captured the Englishman 's castle . <P> These bills do not nationalize urban or rural land outright . But they finally and firmly assert prior Government interest in all land and its uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silkin 's bill revolutionizes the whole basis of tenure and use of British land . Private individuals may continue to own property and use it for profit ( unless and until the national or local Government chooses to take it from them , at a price set by the Government ) . But from the day when Silkin 's bill takes effect , private owners may not alter its present use or sell it for any other use without Government permission . If permission is granted and property value is thereby increased , the Government ( not the owner ) gets the profit " in whole or in part . " <P> If any Government planning measure- or simply a Government refusal to permit any change in the use or ownership of a given property-reduces the value of the land in question , the owner is not entitled to compensation by the Government . Any compensation he may get comes to him not as a vested right but as a favor from an indulgent government . Only if the Government takes land for planned use or compels a property owner to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ways which lessen its current value is compensation granted as a matter of right-and then ' only in amounts determined by the Government . <P> Planner 's Bill . The Government 's purpose is frankly stated in the White Paper : 1 ) to abolish at one stroke all " speculative increase " in private land values and to freeze all land values at those based on the present use of the land ; 2 ) thereby to remove what the White Paper querulously calls " the main obstacle to good planning at present . " Said the Economist this week : " It is a planner 's bill . " Everything in it has one aim-to facilitate national planning of all land use for national purposes .
