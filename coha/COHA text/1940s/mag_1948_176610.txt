Near a soft-drink bar in the main building of the University of Ottawa hangs a crudely crayoned sign : " S'il vous plait-please-pas de bouteilles-no bottles-dans le-in the-gym . " Students shout to each other in English , answer in French . Professors teach all courses in two languages . Everywhere on the campus of Canada 's lone bilingual university le bilinguisme is casually accepted . <P> Last week Ottawa 's 3,000 regular students ( one-third English speaking , two-thirds French ) and its staff ( 125 Oblate fathers , 21 nuns , 147 lay teachers ) crowded on to the campus for the university 's centenary . They put on a pageant , handed out honorary degrees to ten dignitaries , learned that Pope Pius XII had conferred an apostolic benediction on students and staff . They listened to tributes from visitors , heard Dr. Robert Wallace , principal of Queen 's University in Kingston , say : " There are clearly two different philosophies of education in Canada . . . They rest partly in religious exclusiveness-on both sides-partly on language barriers , and partly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be possible to do better than we have yet done , for we have worked in separate rooms in one house . " <P> " The Good Fight . " The University of Ottawa , which had set out to bridge chasms of language and nationality , was born of a compromise . A century ago , Ottawa , known as Bytown , had a festering rivalry between Irish and French , and one lone Catholic school that catered to the Irish and ignored the French . A bilingual college would provide for both . As its founder , and the first Bishop of Bytown , Monsignor Joseph Eugene Bruno Guigues , put it : " These young men living and growing up together would soon come to know and to esteem each other , and while preserving their national idiosyncrasies , would learn to wage side by side the good fight for God and country . " <P> In Father Joseph Henri Tabaret , who took charge of the school five years after it started , Bishop Guigues had just the man to make his bilingual theory work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the priesthood . Science courses were introduced . <P> Father Tabaret died in 1886 . By that time , the city 's French Catholic population was catching up with the Irish . French influence began to dominate the university , and the traditional French emphasis on classics and seminary studies was restored . Prejudices flared up again , and so did fist fights and near riots among the students . In 1929 , the Catholic Church sanctioned an Irish college ( St. Patrick 's ) in Ottawa for those who did not want to attend the university . <P> " Make No Mistake . " With the postwar church drive to expand and modernize education facilities across the Dominion , things began to hum at Ottawa . A medical school was added in 1945 , and $1,212,295 raised for a building to house it . The university also got a new rector , genial Father Jean-Charles Laframboise ( French for the raspberry ) . No cloistered scholar , Le Pre Recteur is ambitious for his school . Of the $250,000 grant the Ontario government gave his medical school last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the first grant . Make no mistake of that . "
