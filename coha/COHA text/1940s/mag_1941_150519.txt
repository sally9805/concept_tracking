Next winter 's oil shortage in the East ( TIME , May 26 ) may not be so bad as Harold Ickes made it sound . The situation was serious , said other Government officials , but not alarming-yet . No one denied that there would be a shortage in the East because of the diversion of 50 tankers from U.S. coasts to help fuel Britain ( TIME , June 9 ) . But an exhaustive American Petroleum Institute report , which A.P.I , had submitted to Washington on the understanding that it would be kept secret , predicted that deliveries of oil to the Atlantic seaboard will be reduced by 8.8% this summer , by 15% next fall . The situation may ease after the first quarter of 1942 , provided new tankers now building are not also diverted to war use . Brash , alarming Mr. Ickes , three days after he was crowned Petroleum Coordinator for National Defense , himself released this supposedly secret information . <P> Ickes ' warnings of " gasless Sundays " recalled World War I days , when Sunday driving became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slacker " at any driver who ventured out . Since then the Sunday ride has become a major U.S. recreation . Washington , in 1941 , shrank from spoiling it , preferred a straight rationing system which would fix the amount of gasoline a consumer could buy each week , permit him to use it whenever he pleased . <P> Mr. Ickes , who had at last flapped into the middle of the defense program , honked ominously . " When I get my feet on the ground I 'll do what 's necessary . " <P> First thing he did was appoint Ralph K. Davies , of Standard Oil Co. of California , as Deputy Petroleum Coordinator , a job reported last week to have gone to Texan Alvin J. Wirtz . Oilmen , who like and respect Davies , drew one small breath of relief .
