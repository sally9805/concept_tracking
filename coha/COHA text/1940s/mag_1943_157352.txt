Fascism 's Labor Day came &; went in Italy last week with scarcely a ripple of celebration . Duce Mussolini , who in bet ter days was wont to show himself barechested , building walls in the former Pontine Marshes , was chest-deep in other , less healthy labor . For the second time in a fortnight he shook up his Party leader ship . Tunisia was on his mind . So was his slowly crumbling Blackshirt State . A new generation of resistance was gathering its strength in Italy : <P> &gt; In Milan , when official administration collapsed in the confusion of British bombing raids , Fascist administrators joined the general flight from the city . At highway crossroads , little groups of work ers stopped all passers , examined identification papers , forced Fascist Party mem bers to return and restore order . <P> &gt; In Turin , when repeated air raids broke down the food-rationing system , workers ' organizations without official authority established iron control over food administration for two days , straightened out the snarls . Then they handed food distribution back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Piedmontese factories last month a sudden wave of simultaneous demonstrations broke down production schedules . This month the strikes ceased-after Mussolini granted a wage increase to war workers . <P> The Long Road . These manifestations were not spontaneous . They were the work of three well-disciplined underground movements , organized on a national scale , with astonishingly large followings among Italian workers . Last March representatives of these organizations-the liberal Partita d'Azione , the socialist and the communist parties-met to discuss a united underground front , later established a " Committee of Action for the Union of the Italian People . " <P> The parties still have their differences , but they have agreed on at least two aims : nationalization of heavy industry , and a democratic state to succeed Mussolini 's Fascist state . Said the liberal party 's newspaper Italia Libera : " Although our ultimate goals differ , there is a long road along which we shall travel together . " <P> The " Committee of Action " publishes underground newspapers in Italy , France and Yugoslavia . In Italy these papers are so widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , but merely confiscate the copies with a warning . A clandestine mimeopaper , La Parola del Soldato ( The Soldier 's Word ) , is circulated among Italian occupation troops in France in collaboration with the French underground . Its aim : " union of action of all Italians ... for an immediate separate peace and for the restitution ... of freedom and independence against the Hitlero-Mussolinian oppressor . " <P> At the End of the Road ? Italy 's underground organizations rely on Allied support . But they feel that Allied statesmen and propagandists have ignored them , even fear that the Allies may dicker with Fascists when Italy is invaded .
