Father Takes a Wife ( RKO Radio ) is tailored to measure for almond-eyed Gloria Swanson , making her reappearance on the screen after seven years . A sophisticated comedy with enough snap in its dialogue and situations to earn a passing grade , it demands only a minimum performance from the hard-eyed , prognathous beauty who was once queen of the silent movies . <P> There is nothing wrong with his age , says Father ( Adolphe Menjou ) , that Leslie Collier ( Miss Swanson ) ca n't cure ; so de la Falaise , Marquis de la Coudraye , in 1925 , she became the first Hollywood actress to enter London and Paris society , which found her " less like an actress and more like a lady than you could imagine .

Wised up by Dancer Goddard , Olivia holds her pretty head so high that her husband realizes he is in love with her . That 's all the immigration authorities wanted to know . He gets in . <P> Dawn 's three principals are so perfectly cast that they seem to have been especially equipped to play their roles . Miss de Havilland 's performance and some of the film 's minor business are artfully done . If Director Mitchell Leisen and Producer Arthur Hornblow Jr . had been content to strip the picture of its elaborate frills ( e.g. , a prolonged cops- &-robbers; chase , a native festival ) and tell it simply , it might have been Grade-A . <P> Lady Be Good ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) is the name of a U.S. musicomedy which Prime Minister Winston Churchill recalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hit song of the show-a 1924 Broadway show that had everything : music ( some of his best ) by George Gershwin ; lyrics by his brother Ira ; book by Guy Bolton and Fred Thompson ; and the dancing Astaires ( Fred and Adele ) .
