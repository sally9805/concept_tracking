At times , he seemed more like a Hoosier schoolmaster than an eminent historian . He was long and lean , baggily dressed , and always in need of a haircut- " a poor professor , " he liked to say , " on his way from obscurity to oblivion . " But when Charles Austin Beard threw back his head , squinted down his long nose , and began to lecture at Columbia University , students jammed in to hear him . And when he perched on the edge of a desk to speak of his own research ( " Now I 'll tell you what I found out last night " ) , historians from all over the U.S. came to attention . <P> " Examine the Assumptions . " " Uncle Charlie , " as his Columbia students called him , was also a great ruffler of conventional thought . He resigned from Columbia in 1917 over the dismissal of two non-interventionist colleagues , though he himself was in favor of U.S. entry into World War I. The New York Times congratulated the university on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was forever popping up-at congressional hearings , protest meetings , or with a new book-to attack Hearst , or Wall Street , the " intellectual bankruptcy of conservatism , " or the internationalists and their " giddy minds . " No one ever quite knew what he would say next . " Have you read Charles Beard 's last book ? " someone once asked Nicholas Murray Butler . Huffed Columbia 's president : " I hope so . " <P> Beard insisted that American history was not only a record of great men , of wars and politics-but also of the way ordinary men &; women had lived in their land , and of the social and economic forces that had led and pushed them . In An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution ( 1913 ) he probed into the personal motives of the Founding Fathers themselves , suggested that as men of property they had been privately interested in a charter that would protect their own wealth . To older historians , such an approach was blasphemous . Harvard 's grizzled Albert Bushnell Hart declared the book " little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much from Uncle Charlie 's rufflings , and from his characteristic " Now , let us examine the assumptions . " And when ( in his opinion ) too many of his followers began to write as if all U.S. history had been " determined " by economic forces alone , he ruffled them once more . Said Beard : " The economic interpretation is one key to history . . . not the key . " He cautioned that all history-writing had an unavoidable bias , that each historian would approve or disapprove , stress or ignore , according to his time and temperament . <P> A Generation to School . Beard 's influence spread beyond his colleagues , the historians . During the ' 20s , with his wife Mary , he wrote a brilliant and provocative survey history of the U.S. , The Rise of American Civilization . The book became a standard work in U.S. schools and colleges . A whole generation of Americans learned their U.S. history in Uncle Charlie 's school .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
