txt CITY RELIEF DEFICIT OF $12,000,000 SEEN BEFORE NEXT JUNE ' For Fiscal Year 1950.51 Cost Will Be $30,000,000 Higher Than Now , Hilliard Says STATE PAYS 80% OF BILL Threatened Cut in That Share Would Be ' Disaster , ' Report to Council Declares The city faces a $12,000,000 deficit in welfare costs for the fiscal year ending next June 30 , and a sharp increase in expenditures for the next fiscal year to care for a steadily rising number of residents needing public assistance , it was reported yesterday by Raymond M. Hilliard , Commissioner of Welfare . The current appropriations of $172,886,463 will be exhausted about a month before the end of the fiscal year , he estimated , and the city will need the additional $12,000,000 , a large part of which would be paid by the state , to care for its needy . These now number 322,000 and applications for aid are increasing at the rate of 3,000 persons a month . This increase will continue through the 1950-51 fiscal year , Commissioner Hilliard said , and for that period the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $30,211,537 over the current year . He predicted that by July , 1951 , more than 380,000 persons would be receiving help . State Pays Most of Costs The state gives 80 per cent of the costs of the home relief and veterans ' assistance programs . However , Governor Dewey indicated last week that the 1950 Legislature would be asked to consider whether this percentage should be cut . Commissioner Hilliard said - any cut would be " disastrous , " predicting that such a proposal , if enacted , would ' involve a reduction of 25 per cent in the public assistance allowance here . He called for opposition to it " by all means possible . " The Commissioner 's statements on welfare costs were made in a letter to Thomas J. Mirabile , chairman of the City Affairs Committee of the City Council . Mr. Hilliard appeared before the committee last week , defending cuts in home relief allowances , which will go down about 5 per icent on Jan. 16 . At the hearing , the committee , which is considering a resolution requesting the Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prepare a report on the status of present appropriations for relief . He sent a two-page letter , supported by three tables , detailing his figures . He said the deficit would be incurred despite the adjustments in public assistance allowances and " all other possible economies . " " Special attention is called to the fact that substantially all of the deficit this year occurs in home relief and in veteran- assistance , " the Commissioner wrote . " In veteran assistance , there is an average of more than three persons to a case ; in home relief , two persons to a case . " These groups include many who , through no fault of their own , are thrown out of work . Our present rate of new applicatibns is in // CITY RELIEF DEFICIT OF $12,000,000 SEEN // creasing and this always foretells an increase in relief loads . " The tables showed that the home relief appropriation was $38,858 , - 000 , but that the estimates of cost for the year were $50,727,000 . The veterans assistance allotments are $4,487,000 , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1951 , the projected case-load in home relief will rise 32.2 per cent to 66,971 and the veterans assistance cases will increase 42.9 per cent to 8,862 . The respective costs will be $58,224,000 and $8,316,000 , according to the report . Mr. Hilliard pointed out in his tables that the bulk of these amounts would be paid by the state ? 46,684,000 for home relief and $6,648,000 for veterans assistance . The Commissioner also analyzed the delicate relations  --  present and future  --  of city and state in sharing the relief costs . City 's Share of Added Costs " Out of the estimated deficit of $12,000,000 for the remainder of this fiscal year , the city will have to provide an additional $2,565 , - 000. " he said . " For the estimated increase of $30,211,537 above current appropriations for the next fiscal year . the increase in the city 's share would be $6,815,437 . This means that a total of $9,380. - 437 of new city money will have to be found in next year 's budget . " Over and beyond this , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration  --  that the state may try to lessen its contribution to home relief costs which , together with veterans assistance , comprise the largest element of welfare costs in New York City . Were any such change to be made by the state , it would result in a calamity to the city . " Mr. Hilliard reported that one of the proposals for such a cut , said to be under consideration by some state officials , would reduce the state 's share of aid from 80 per cent to 60 per cent . " Were this proposal adopted , " the Commissioner commented , " the net effect would be to add still ' another $15,000,000 to the city 's I share of the cost for the estimated public assistance case-load net year . The cumulative effect would then result in a requirement for more than $64,000,000 of city payments for public assistance costs next year , as against the appropriation of $39,774,563 for the city 's share in the current appropriation . " Noting that the city 's financial experts were finding it impossible to meet all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Were the proposal as presented above enacted into law , it might involve a reduction in public assistance allowances of 25 per cent . Any other proposal for reduction in the state 's share of relief costs would also adversely affect the city and hence be a threat to the adequacy of public assistance allowances . " Therefore any proposal to reduce the state 's share of relief costs must be opposed by all means possible . " The tables showed that the state 's share of total costs for the current fiscal year was $91,113,775 and that $113,006,000 would be required from that source in the next year , an increase of $21 , - 892,225 . The estimates for the 1950-51 year also called for an expendi. ture of $43,502,000 by the Federal Government , which allotted $41 , . 998,125 this year for the old-age assistance , assistance to the blind : and aid to dependent-children programs of the city .
