Reports and rumors poured into London that : <P> &gt; Ten thousand workers in the industrial regions , including Lyon , were striking . ( Vichy admitted some strikes had been " attempted .

Or perhaps the United Nations had decided at last that revolt in Europe was at flood tide now .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
