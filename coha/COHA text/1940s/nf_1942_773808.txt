Thus , our second attempt to work at the Center was brought to a sudden halt in exactly the same manner as the first one had been ? through a newspaper article . These two incidents show , as well as anything could , the fate that would have befallen The New History Society had it been irrevocably delivered into the hands of the Assemblies . Cablegram On April 9 , 1930 , The New History Society received an answer to its cablegram addressed to the Guardian : My prayer at holy shrines for History Society is that its members may increasingly realize that the efficacy and permanence of their endeavors lie in unreserved acceptance of teaching of Baha-U-LIah and Abdul Baha . May they be blessed and guided to identify themselves wholly with the Faith . Reciprocate your loving greetings . Shoghi .

The period of uncertainty was very trying , bringing nerves to a breaking point and , as signs became more and more ominous , insistent pressure was brought upon us to make some sort of compromise . I remember an amusing incident which took place at that time . One of the older Bahais , who had never met Mrs. Chanler , came to call and , when the visit was drawing to a close , this lady presented her hostess with a lovely white rose , saying that it was her custom to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Chanler was about to protest that she was in perfect health , when she suddenly realized that the implication was on the grounds of spiritual illness ; so she simply thanked her guest with a smile . Another humorous experience returns to my mind . There was a Bahai from New Zealand , spending some weeks in New York , who used to drop in at our meetings from time to time . One evening , learning that he was in a bad state financially , I took him to my room to spend the night . Then , in the morning he speeded to the Center , and this is the story that he told : After some hours of rest , he had awakened and , looking over at me , had seen me lying in the unconsciousness of sleep , revealed in my true colors : ? two horns had made their appearance on my forehead ! This account of my night with the New Zealander circulated among the Bahais , some of whom believed that this young man had had a flash of second sight ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only wished that the season had been summer when no blankets are used , for in that IO2 BROKEN SILENCE case , the story would doubtless have culminated in a long , sleek , curling tail ! Representative members of the Bahai organization did their utmost to make us understand the laws of the Administration . Out of the goodness of their hearts and in their devotion to the Guardian , they explained the importance of obedience to the Central Authority but , although we would have liked to meet them more than half way , we were convinced that this young movement would not long survive the ministrations of the Assemblies . Mrs. Chanler 's soul questionings during that winter were continuous and intense , for they centered around the possibility of doing permanent injury to the Cause . She was in a state close to collapse when she sailed for Europe in the spring of 1930 . Little Regiment for Shoghi Effendi Before her departure , classes for The New History Society under the direction of Mr. Edward J.

Believe you will collect little regiment for Shoghi Effendi . May the Master help you . One More Chance In July , I received a visit from Mr. Alfred Lunt , member of the National Spiritual Assembly , who carried in his pocket the draft of an article destined to appear in Bahai News of the following month . In this statement , The New // History Society was disowned by the authorities , and it constituted , therefore , the long dreaded break with the Administration . I read the typewritten pages very carefully , realizing that I was being given one more chance , and then I told Mr. Lunt that , as far as I was concerned , the paper could go to press . However , I continued , if you put your signature to this , the day will come when you will wish that you had cut off your right hand instead . This prophecy of mine was never fulfilled , for a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bahai community . He was a talented and warm-hearted man , a devoted servant of the Cause and a definitely liberalizing influence on the National Spiritual Assembly . A Thunder Clap And now the inevitable , which had been warded off for so long , happened . It electrified the Bahai community in this city ; while The New History Society , which had always been kept in utter innocence of what was going on regarding it , went on its own light-hearted way in complete unconcern . The first pronouncement against The New History Society was published in the pages of Bahai News of August 1930 under the ominous title : The Case of fl hmad Sohrab and The New History Society . Here are a few quota-tions : The National Spiritual Assembly finds it necessary to make a definite statement to the Bahais of the United States and Canada concerning the relations of The New History Society and the Cause . I04 BROKEN SILENCE This Society was started in New York City early in 1929 by Ahmad Sohrab , one of its avowed purposes being to spread the Bahai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulted in the matter , and the meetings and activities of The New History Society have been maintained apart from the principles of consultation and Assembly supervision which today , under the Will and Testament of Abdul Baha , form the basis of Bahai unity and protection of the Cause ... . Under these conditions it becomes the obvious responsibility of the National Spiritual Assembly to inform the friends that the activities conducted by Ahmad Sohrab , through The New History Society , are to be considered as entirely independent of the Cause ; as outside the jurisdiction of the Local and National Assembly , and hence in no wise entitled to the cooperation of Bahais ... . In clarifying this difficult situation for the body of believers , the National Assembly urges an attitude which shall express full loyalty to Bahai administration and also unfailing kindness and good will to individuals ... . Every believer must take to heart this lesson , that individual Bahai effort , without due consultation , is foredoomed to failure . A Volunteer When Mr. and Mrs. Chanler received the news , in Paris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch from the parent tree , they were not shaken in the least . Even now , I smile as I recall Mr. Chanler 's cablegram to me . In it , he offered to open the lectures himself during the coming winter , speaking on the Twelve Bahai Principles . // Now , in the past , Mr. Chanler had been a speaker of note , having been Lieut. - Governor of New York State and a distinguished criminal lawyer ; but he had retired long ago , and besides he had never studied the Bahai teachings . This generous suggestion , therefore , implied a great effort on his part , but he was willing to make it , in order to stand by the work ; and I accepted his offer gratefully and without a qualm . In the Hands of the Master In the year 1926 , shortly after she had come into the Cause , Mrs. Chanler had made a pilgrimage to Haifa , Palestine , to visit the Holy Shrines . There she had the inestimable happiness of spending an hour with The Greatest Holy Leaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household . It happened that Shoghi Effendi was not feeling well that day , so she did not have the privilege of meeting him . I believe that Mrs. Chanler 's reaction to the break with the Bahai Administration could be no better described than in a letter written by her , at the time , to Rouha Khanoum , daughter of Abdul Baha . It reads as follows : September 8 , 1930 . The evening before I left Paris , your letter came to me and I took it out to Versailles where we were going , and there I read it many times . As I looked at the beautiful trees and listened to the orchestra , my eyes were full of tears , and my heart full of love for you and infinite gratitude . This message of friendship , coming at a time when my life had so changed , affected me very much , and I felt that on this new path I was taking a I06 BROKEN SILENCE jewel of your giving ; and even if I do not see you again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , I will always count on your love and every day give you mine . I have never talked to you about the trouble which has passed , but today I will say a few words about it . Often in the past , I have heard the Bahais say ( Mr. Mills , Mr. Holley and others ) : " If only a way could be found to spread the Cause ! " Just by chance , because the Organization would not use Ahmad , we stumbled on the method of The New History Society . This has proved a very effective one , and the chief reason for its success has been that it was free . Here , without obligation to any one , the people hear about the Bahai Cause and gradually absorb it . We can not , with a free conscience , sell these people behind their backs to any Organization , much less to an Organization , orthodox , cruel and unsuccessful . Just the same , we tried to serve this Organization . We never spoke against them . We brought them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe , Ahmad , with all his resourcefulness and enthusiasm , was directing the course of The New History Society straight toward the Administration . Surely many , many dozens would have joined then ; and they would have set a precedent which would have been followed by the very best souls in their ranks , month by month , year by year . The Bahai Cause is almost dead in America ; what is left of it is pitiful and ignoble . 1 believe that Abdul Bahia is tired of this situation , and before him I say that I believe that he is using us to start the Cause once more . Where he will lead us , I do n't know . The National Assembly has turned the course of The New History Society away from the Administration , and it // would seem just about impossible to turn it back . We are in the hands of the Master and we are not a bit afraid . Wonderful Berthalin is with us . It makes a lot of difference . Beloved Rouha Iihanoum , every hour I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel his displeasure . I only feel his love and I am very happy . A Higher Court When Mr. and Mrs. Chanler reached New York in the early autumn , they learned that the Guardian had endorsed the action of the National Spiritual Assembly through the following cablegram , published in Bahai News of September 193o . Approve action regarding History Society . Deeply appreciate loyalty ( of ) believers . Shoghi . Then , a few days after their arrival , Mr. and Mrs. Chanler , to their surprise , received a communication from the National Spiritual Assembly : September 25 , 1930 . The National Assembly is meeting in West Englewood , N. J. on October 10th , 11th and 12th , 1930 . They would like very much if you both could accept their warm invitation to meet with them informally and talk over the various matters which are common to our hearts . They feel that association and a better understanding of each other and the welding of acquaintance and friendship will be of the greatest value in forwarding AT THE FORK OF THE ROAD IOc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all striving . They sincerely hope you will accept this sincere invi tation in the spirit of love and friendship in which i is sent . Anytime convenient for you can be arranged for ? whether during the sessions or dinner or lunch . Looking forward to the happiness of meeting you . It may be remembered that in the National Spiritua Assembly 's pronouncement against The New History So-ciety my name alone was mentioned . Therefore , without much reading between the lines , one can judge that the purpose of the above letter was to dissociate Mr. and Mrs. Chanler from a lost cause ? in other words , it implied ; suggestion to leave the sinking ship . It took next to no time for Mrs. Chanler to answer the invitation and , within a few hours , her letter was on it way . To my mind , this is a great document , and posterit can judge its contents according to its own standard : Dear Friends in the Cause of Baha-U-Llah : I was touched by your kind letter of September 25i1 which I received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship between us all would not h impossible , even after the difficulties which have passed I do not feel any pride or any stubbornness , and if yoi will allow me to say so , I have a little love for all of you which may or may not be acceptable . Last year , although I jealously guarded this work o ours , my purpose was only , and entirely , to bring th fruit of it to your doors . I would not have liked to mis one sincere soul among our members , but wanted t Ito BROKEN SILENCE bring all of them to strengthen your forces at your center . This was my heart 's desire , and without this aim I would have had no inspiration in the work . Nevertheless , circumstances were against us and the tide of The New History Society was turned afield . Neither Ahmad nor I could turn it back now , because the people have lost confidence . I have always believed in the unification of forces and I do believe in an Administration , although I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that the guidance of the Assemblies should be something to be desired , not something to he submitted to , and that the sanction of the Publishing Committee should be an asset to be intensely hoped for , not an obligation . Last summer , I found myself unexpectedly in Rouen and there I visited the tower room where , in the year 1431 , Jeanne d'Are was tried . As I leaned against those very walls where she had leaned , and as the questions and answers of her trial which were hung up on the wall , were read to me , my eyes filled with tears for her , and my heart with grief . She had been asked to believe in the row of priests before her as instruments of God to be submitted to , and when , after repeated questioning , she still insisted that she could not , they declared her to be outside of the Church and sentenced her to what they called the minimum penalty , which was only burning , Two Members of the Court went on record as thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King , whom she had served for nearly two years and loved so much , but with her confidence in her God and in her Cause undiminished , she gave up her life on the market place and withdrew to her eternal glory . Today , it is not a woman , but a man who stands beAT THE FORK OF THE ROAD I l l fore the Bar of the Church , and after the passing of exactly five centuries to the very year , the question asked is still the same . I myself am nothing in this , except that I see Truth in this man , as I believe that I would have seen it in Jeanne d'Arc , had I been there . That same day in Rouen , I visited the Shrine where her memory is glorified by the same Church which condemned her , and I lit a candle before that Shrine , for the Cause of Baha-U-Llah . After nearly two years , the question of The New History Society has passed out of your hands and out of ours . The Guardian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a letter received ( by a mutual friend ) two days ago from Ruhi Effendi , post-scripted by the Guardian , he says : " Anyhow , by the attitude the National Spiritual Assembly has taken considering the History Society outside the Cause , and the advice they have given the friends to dissociate themselves from it , we hope that the problem is solved . " And again in the same letter ? " Anyhow , thank God that the ( lie is cast and the final decision is taken . " The problem which has absorbed too much time already has been decided by a higher Court . I can not question that decision . Therefore , a meeting between us , even though unofficial as you so considerately suggested , would be useless . The whole matter is now disposed of and we must all accept . I want to thank you many times and send you all my best wishes . It is possible that in the future we may meet in a personal way . I should be most pleased . I I2 BROKEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New History Society , as published in Bahai News of August 1930 , and the later cablegram from the Guardian were not sufficient to allay the unrest in the Bahai Community . The anxiety and dissatisfaction continued unabated , the reason being that many looked upon our work Therefore , Bahai News allotted more than three pages in its November issue to a further discussion of the problem , in a section entitled The Principle of Bahai Freedom . fl Statement Concerning the Episode of The New History Society . I will give a few extracts : Because of certain misunderstandings that still prevail among a few believers , the National Spiritual Assembly feels it advisable to issue this further statement , supplementing and confirming the statement published in Bahai News for August 1930 , regarding the episode of The New History Society . The desire of the National Assembly is to so clarify the matter by recording the various steps leading to the adoption of the previous statement that no doubts may remain in a single Bahai heart . It will be understood by every believer that the following quotations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity within the institutions of the Cause , and The New History Society is referred to merely as an episode in our Bahai experience . It is devoutly believed that careful consideration of the matter as here presented will remove these definite // sources of misunderstanding and , consequently , sources of disunity among the believers . The New History Society itself is relative to the discussion only as having occasioned a temporary test to a number of Bahais . The definite sources of misunderstanding to be removed are , first , that the Guardian has ever or will ever sanction any activity as " Bahai " which stands in opposition or indifference to the permanent general principles of administration given us under the Will and Testament of Abdul Baha ; second , that the Guardian could ever conceivably be so misled by false or inaccurate communications from any source that his instructions are subject to personal interpretation ; and third , that the guidance or inspiration felt by any group of believers possesses a superior spiritual validity to the deliberations of a duly elected Spiritual Assembly and thus justifies opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cablegram from Shoghi Effendi included in above article : Feel strongly Ahmad Sohrab should uphold unconditionally authority Local and National Assembly . Quotations from letters written by Shoghi Effendi included in above article : Attendance Ahmad meeting conditioned upon Ahmad 's unquestioned acceptance to conduct meetings on lines fully sanctioned by National Spiritual Assembly . True unity can only be preserved by maintenance paramount position National Spiritual Assembly . Ahmad Sohrab 's activities should be watched carefully , lest a weak handling of this extremely delicate situation may confuse the minds of the friends and II4 BROKEN SILENCE cause a split in the Cause . The Cause has already triumphed over such cases which flare up for a time , then recede into the shadows of oblivion and are thought of no more . The case of Khyrullah , Fareed , Dyer , Mrs. White and others testify to this truth . Quotations from two letters written by Ruhi Effendi , Shoghi E f f endi 's secretary , included in the same article : In none of the Guardian 's letters to Mrs. Chanler has Shoghi Effendi approved of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who was over-zealous about The New History Society wrote Shoghi Effendi that the members of the New York Assembly are gradually becoming milder and perhaps drawn to the History Society . This is to solve the problem in the wrong way . It is not the Assembly that has to be won to the cause of some rebellious person , but that person brought back under the authority of the Assembly . Some persons in the ( United ) States feel that the History Society was badly represented to Shoghi Effendi . The source of all our information is the writings of Ahmad and the publications of that group . In all his circular letters he harped on the note of freedom and denounced the red tape that characterizes organizations . I have to thank Ruhi Effendi for so concisely summing up my characteristics in the above statement . I could not have done it better myself . An almost religious belief in freedom for all men , and a dislike for the red tape that applies to organizations ( especially supposedly spiritual ones ) are strongly developed in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and always will . AT THE FORK OF THE ROAD I I S Tainted Money The main activity of the Bahai Administration has been , and still is , centered about the building of a great Temple in Wilmette , Illinois . In 1929 , Mr. Chanler made a considerably large contribution to the Temple Fund , which was graciously accepted ; and again on January 2 , 1930 , Mr. and Mrs. Chanler and I sent in comparatively modest donations for the same purpose . Now , one of the fixed rules of the Administration is that no money may be accepted from non-Bahais for the building of the Temple . Therefore , these latter checks were retained uncashed in the administrative files for more than ten months , and on November 6 , 1930 , after my expulsion from the organization , a letter was written by Mr. Alfred Lunt to Mr. and Mrs. Chanler stating that the checks could be used for Bahai purposes in the discretion of the National 11 ssembly and asking that they be made payable to the National Bahai Fund instead of to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding moneys received from Bahais and non-Bahais , struck Mrs. Chanler as too complicated for her to deal with , so she asked me to answer in her place . I did so to the best of my ability , closing as follows : ... If the money of a man who served Abdul Baha for eight years and who is giving the last drop of his blood to spread this Cause , and if the money of Mr. and Mrs. Chanler , who are devoting all their energies in the same direction , is not good enough for the Temple , then , I believe , and I assert before the world , that all the hundreds of thousands of dollars that have been given by others have been given uselessly . I16 BROKEN SILENCE I lament and weep over the conditions of today . Not only do I do so , but Baha-U-Llah himself , and Abdul Baha himself lament and weep for that which , within a few short years , has been done to their universal spiritual Cause . In your official pronunciamento of August of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ahmad Sohrab are in no wise entitled to the cooperation of Bahais . How can this statement be squared with this recent communication that you are willing to accept money for Bahai Activities from a man whom you have publicly repudiated ? Is this consistent ? Or , has one standard been chosen for the National Assembly and another for the poor Bahais , standing as so many pawns on their chessboard ? Mrs. Chanler wished to answer your letter to her , but she found that she could not . The Last Letter During the winding up of the year 1930 , the agitation in the Bahai Community persisted . Although Mrs. Chanler had accepted the decision of the Guardian without hesitancy or question , many of the well-wishers of The New History Society could not bring themselves to look upon the matter as closed . Consequently , as this tempestuous year drew to an end , Mrs. Chanter , with a view to protect these friends of hers from further distress , wrote a final letter to Mr. Alfred Lunt , the one member of the National Spiritual Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in full . December 28 , 1930 . In these last days of 1930 , I feel that I must make a resolution , difficult as it is , for the New Year . // You , and many of our dear beloved friends , have suffered enough on our account . You have risked your own comfort , you have tried to protect us , you have loved us and showered us with kindness . Now we want to thank you for all this and to withdraw from your lives . We think this is the wisest thing to do and we beg you to agree with us . If , at some future date , God wishes to bring us together , He will do it ; and in the meantime we will all work for His Cause according to the light that we have , and I am sure , with great understanding of each other . As Bahais , we know a place to meet that is not in the physical world but somewhere in the presence of the Master , and in these meetings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of writing this for a long time and now I know that the moment has come . Do n't make yourself sad by answering , I will always love you . P. S. I am sending the same letter to nine of our friends . The above communication was addressed to : Mrs. Edward J. Kinney Mrs. May Maxwell Miss Juliet Thompson Miss Jean Silver Mrs. Audrey Foster Miss Mae Seabeck Mrs. Margueritta Smythe Mrs. Frances Fales In spite of this letter , our connections with many of the 13ahais continued , the affection on both sides being too great to be set aside . Later , however , an order originating either in Haifa or with the National Spiritual Assembly // ( which , I do not actually know ) , brought all association to an end . There was a single exception made to this ruling and , for years , Mrs. Chanler had the joy of seeing her closest friend in the Cause ; but , with the institution of the lawsuit , this especial dispensation was cancelled . Thus , the only remaining link between ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , a few Bahais have openly stood by our work , regardless of consequences . Conspicuous among these is Mr. O. J. Hanko , who has been in the Cause for about thirty years . He was a charter member of The New History Society , and , although he lives out of town , he is ever ready with encouragement and assistance . Also , there are Miss Jane Durand , of Asbury Park , New Jersey , whose kindness has never failed us , and Major Joseph Honore Jaxon , eighty years old , one of the few remaining pioneers of the Cause in America . Another , among the earliest Bahais in this country , is Mrs. Frederick Allien , the former Berthalin Lexow . Mrs. Allien has , through the years , identified herself with the work of The New History Society in a very notable way , and has been an example of courage and self-sacrifice . A Cardinal Principle The official and unofficial records , contained in the typewritten book entitled The Nev. ; History Society and the Bahai Organization , cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 , 1931 . From many of these letters and statements , I have quoted only a part ; from some communications from Haifa , which were addressed to others besides ourselves , I have not felt at liberty to quote at all . I20 BROKEN SILENCE However , through the extracts used , I believe that the points of difference between the Assemblies and The New History Society have been made clear . Throughout those three years , the Bahai Administration made its claims , which undoubtedly it thought just , and tried to impose them ; and throughout the same period of time , The New History Society , with at least equal earnestness , struggled to maintain its integrity so that it could look the world square in the face . Here there is a difference in point of view , so fundamental , that no words and no effort can change it , at least as far as mortal vision can perceive . For ourselves , we shall continue along the path that we have chosen so deliberately ; we shall teach freedom of conscience , respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women of all systems of thought tending toward a true comradeship of human beings , born and unborn . Then , shall we teach religious liberty ? To ask the question is to answer it . The aspiration toward religious liberty has always existed in the consciousness of mankind . It lives in Hindu hearts , in Jewish hearts , in Christian hearts , in Islamic hearts and , after its long leap from the heart of The Most Great Prisoner in fl cca , it lives in the hearts of people everywhere . This is a cardinal principle of the New World Order . P A R T T H R E E BAHAI LAWSUIT 5 . The Trade-mark 6 . The Decision 7 . The Name 8 . The Appeal So speak ye , and so do , as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty . ?

My part in helping the growth and progress of this work has been a humble one . I claim nothing for myself , but I claim everything for these two servants of Baha-O-Llah . During the last eleven years , through the channel of The New History Society , the name and fame of the Cause of Baha-O-Llah have penetrated to the four corners of the earth . By means of public meetings , at which a succession of the intellectual and spiritual leaders of humanity ( both Americans and distinguished visitors from abroad ) have delivered their messages ; through annual Prize Competitions on topics of world peace , world religion , world reconstruction , racial amity , etc. ; through the publication of hooks and leaflets ( some of which have been translated into 30 languages ) ; through its monthly and quarterly organs respectively New His/ory and The Children 's Caravan ; through The Caravan , a young people 's movement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // holding of classes and numerous other methods , these two souls have rendered unparalleled services to the Cause of Baha-O-Llah . The annals of Bahai history in the Western world contain few records of such personal dedication . Mr. and Mrs. Chanler have consecrated everything ? their name , their house , their possessions and , last but not least , their privacy to hold aloft the sacred name of Baha-O-Llah and to make his teachings better known to young and old in the continents of Africa , Asia , Europe , Australia , New Zealand , South and Central America , Canada , Mexico and the Islands of the Seas . Seldom has such a missionary work been undertaken ; seldom has it been formulated and carried into execution with such enthusiasm , energy , forethought and utter disregard to personal comfort and rest . Their Reward And now comes recognition from the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the United States and Canada ! But , before I mention this recognition , let me state that during the last eleven years this body of men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New History Society , to attribute to its founders and members all sorts of unworthy motives ; to publish in Bahai News articles of a most crude character and to countenance stories and rumors that have no foundation in fact and no relation to reality . In taking this attitude and in systematically following a course of enmity and persecution , the members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the United States and Canada have been free and untrammeled ; one may assert that they have used ( or in my // opinion have abused ) their constitutional right of free press , free speech and free assembly . I am the last man to blame them for what they have written ! Praise be to God that in these United States the citizens are free to relieve themselves of their opinions about any one , be he a humble laborer , a political leader or a one-time friend . But , all I have to state here is this : For eleven years Mr. and Mrs. Chanler have kept a dignified silence ; for eleven years they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met these attacks , and for eleven years , serene and undisturbed , they have heeded the advice of the Great Teacher by meeting evil with good . Serene and undisturbed ! I am probably exaggerating a little , for there were times when the darts of the members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the United States and Canada and the Local Assembly of New York did hurt ; yet one glance backward to the martyrdoms of the early Babis and Bahais who suffered at the hands of the enemies of freedom and progress was sufficient to restore their equanimity and their confidence . This radiant acquiescence would unquestionably have continued for the rest of their lives had the members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the United States and Canada confined themselves to periodic insinuations in Bahai News and to the setting afloat of their fanciful stories and rumors ; but something happened that has made the writing of this book imperative . In 1939 , The New History Society exhibited its works and literature in Science and Education Building at the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea came to the mind of Mrs. Frederick Allien , one of the first // Bahais in this country , who had been called Berthalin by Abdul Baha and who has used this name ever since . The idea was that it would be a valuable service to the Cause if , after the closing of the Fair , our exhibit could be transported to the city . After some consultation , it was decided to take this step as a purely temporary activity , and on November 7th , 1939 , Bahai Bookshop was opened at 828 Lexington Avenue , a lease having been signed for the duration of six months . I admit that we were fully conscious that , in all probability , the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the United States and Canada would resent this further heralding of the Bahai name and teachings . However , we were prepared , as in the past , to meet opposition in silence . Then On December 5 , 1939 , the postman delivered the following letter to Bahai Bookshop : ( Letterhead of ) WATSON , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York December 5 , 1939 . By registered mail to Mrs. Julie Chanler , Bahai Bookshop , 828 Lexington Avenue , New York , N. Y.

Will you please give the matter immediate consideration and advise us of your decision . Yours truly , ( Sgd . ) Watson , Bristol , Johnson &; Leavenworth . A few days after the receipt of this letter , Mrs. Chanler placed the matter in the hands of Mr. Fred J. Bechert , I28 BROKEN SILENCE of the firm Mitchell &; Bechert , and the following correspondence ensued . ( Letterhead of ) MITCHELL &; BECHERT 420 Lexington Avenue New York , N. Y. December 21 , 1939 . Messrs . Watson , Bristol , Johnson &; Leavenworth , 6 East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bahai Book Shop Gentlemen : This is in reply to your letter of December 5th , receipt of which we acknowledged under date of December 12th . We have conferred with Mrs. Chanler and examined a great deal of literature relating to the Bahai Cause . Through our investigation , we have learned that in about the year 1863 Mirza Hossain Ali , a Persian nobleman , felt that he was inspired by God and that it was his duty to bring a message of light and glory to a harassed world . He adopted as a spiritual name " BahaU-Llah " . This name was to signify the " light " or " glory " of God . Prior to 1863 , there were followers of the Bab and the individual followers were known as Babis . The Babis later became followers of Baha-ULlah , who carried on the cause , and the followers of Baha-U-Llah became known as Bahais . Long prior to the year 1900 , the word " Bahai " had become a well known descriptive word to identify a follower of BahaTILE // U-Llah in precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follower of Christ . It is our opinion , therefore , and we have so advised Mrs. Chanler , that Bahai , long prior to the year 1900 , became and now is a word of common speech necessary for use in aptly describing a follower of Baha-U-Llah . In our opinion , therefore , the word " Bahai " can not legally be exclusively appropriated by your client . Mrs. Chanler advises us that she is a Bahai , and that her Bahai Book Shop specializes in Bahai books , pamphlets , and literature in general for the dissemination of the Bahai teachings . It is our understanding that Mrs. Chanler , far from 4 ? ompeting unfairly with your client , is engaged in the work of furthering and spreading the Bahai cause , which , we take it , is also the purpose and effort of your client . Yours very truly , B/S Mitchell &; Bechert . ( Letterhead of ) WATSON , BRISTOL , JOHNSON &; LEAVENWORTH 6 East 45th Street New York December 22 , 1939 . Re : Bahai Bookshop Messrs .

You state that in your opinion the word Bahai " is a // word of common speech necessary for use in aptly describing a follower of Baha-U-Llah . " You do not state , however , that the word is descriptive of the goods on which our client uses it as a trademark , namely , magazines , printed books , and other publications , and it is obvious that such is not the case . The use of this word by your client on publications not published by our client and in the trade name Bahai Bookshop constitutes trademark infringement and unfair competition . Moreover , the use by your client of the trade name Bahai Bookshop is a misrepresentation and a deceptive use because it gives the erroneous impression that the book shop is operated or sponsored by our client , the official Bahai religious organization , and the use of the name Bahai Bookshop without our client 's authority and consent also infringes our client 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may want to reconsider your opinion in this matter , and request that you do so .

Watson , Bristol , Johnson &; Leavenworth , 6 East 45th Street , New York , N. Y. Re : Bahai Book Shop Gentlemen : This is in reply to your letter of December 22 , 1939. // We regret that our letter of December 21st did not make our client 's position entirely clear . It is our opinion that " Bahai ' is a descriptive word for aptly describing a follower of the Bahai teachings and , furthermore , that the word " Bahai " , whether or not used as a trade-mark , if it is applied on Bahai literature is descriptive of that literature . If your client is in the general publishing business and applies the word " Bahai " to books and periodicals having nothing to do with Bahai teachings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and periodicals . Our client uses the word " Bahai " in the title of its Bahai Bookshop in a descriptive sense to identify it as a book shop specializing in Bahai literature . Our client denies that the use of the trade name " Bahai Bookshop " is either a misrepresentation or a deceptive use . As stated , the Bahai Bookshop represents that it specializes in Bahai literature and , as a matter of fact , Mrs. Chanler is herself a Bahai . Our client further denies that the use of the trade name " Bahai Bookshop " gives any erroneous impression that the shop is operated or sponsored by your client , since your client , in our judgment , has no exclusive right to the name " Bahai " to describe a follower of the Bahai teachings or to identify those teachings in book form or otherwise . We must therefore repeat that , in our opinion , our client is not infringing any rights of your client and is not unfairly competing with your client . Yours very truly , Mitchell &; Bechert . BSS // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the contents of the above correspondence between the two attorneys-at-law will reveal several interesting facts : i . The National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the United States and Canada have made a trademark of the name Bahai. 2 . According to the text of application filed March Io , 1928 , Serial No. 262,923 the Bahai Organization is a corporation . 3 . The word Bahai is a trademark as actually used by applicant upon goods , and requests that the same be registered in the United States Patent Office .... The trade-nark has been continuously used and applied to said goods in applicant 's business since 19oo. 4 . The goods or merchandise that the applicant sells and which are protected by a trade-mark are the words of Baha-O-Llah and Abdul Baha. 5 . Baha-O-Llah and Abdul Baha lived in prison , suffered and gave their teachings free for the religious unification of mankind in order that , in 1928 , these spiritual heavenly teachings be monopolized , and sold under trade-mark to an unsuspecting public as so much goods , similar to Blue Sunoco , G. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new , blended with Havana , White Owl Cigar ( it 's milder ) ! 6 . The members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the United States and Canada , like their expanding sister monopolists , are reaching out to stifle all unfair competition , holding Bahai Bookshop reTILE // sponsihle for pro fits to which , incidentally , they are welcome if they are willing to meet the losses as well . 7 . The Bahai organization is not a religion , nor a spiritual renaissance , nor the spirit of the age , but is a fullfledged corporation which , while it engages itself in marketing the principles of Baha-O-Llah for the establishment of Universal Peace , through its various branches in the United States , Canada and in other parts of the world , has protected these goods by taking out a trade-mark on the very name which more than twenty thousand Persian men and women claimed at the price of their lives . This is the first instance in the history of religion where the privilege of calling oneself a follower of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mohammad or any other , has been involved with the interests of a trust or corporation . What , for instance would have happened to Christianity if , added to the difficulties of establishing a new religion , the early Christians had had to contend with property rights on the name and teachings that they were ready to die for ? It is certain that such a liability would have stifled the movement in its infancy and that , before the passing of a hundred years , the words of Jesus would have been heard of no more . The Cause of Baha-O-Llah is no different . Strong as it is , commercial interests and the lust for power are stronger yet if allowed to operate unopposed ; and this new-born child , the hope of the ages , will unquestionably cease to breathe if its neck continues to be weighted with the steel links of an international chain store . 1 34 BROKEN SILENCE Back to The New History Society General membership in The New History Society is free . Sustaining membership consists simply of subscription to our monthly magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band of volunteers and free souls who have come together with the desire to help in the formation of the new history of the world and to promulgate the constructive and universal principles of Baha-O-Llah . These men and women are not tied to any formula . They are the children of the New Age and the heralds of the New Civilization . More than 99 per cent of all expenses of The New History Society and its manifold activities have , during the past eleven years , been paid quietly and unassumingly by Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler . Bahai News The Feb. 1940 issue of Bahai News on page 3 , in an article signed by the National Spiritual Assembly under the title of Vigor and Spiritual Health of the Community , directs its attack , without mentioning any name , to Mr. and Mrs. Chanler , The New History Society and Bahai Bookshop . We quote : The believers in all lands are under the supreme favor of guidance from on High . They strive to uphold , day by day , ideals and principles which relate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind . But on the other hand , to aid the endeavors of those who outwardly claim allegiance but secretly try to destroy the Divine Edifice through enmity to its leader , would manifestly be the most grievous of errors . // Historically such disloyalty , synchronizing with the expansion of the Faith , had its appearance when some who were professedly loyal to the Bab , disobeyed His Covenant by refusing to accept Baha'u'llah as the expected One of the Beyan . They were urged on by a sordid ambition which brought them ignominy , oblivion and loss . Later the same condition became apparent after the ascension of Baha'u'llah when a few corrupt people violated His solemn Covenant by refusing to accept its Center , Abdul-Baha . Again , a diminishing few , urged on by vaulting ambition and an obvious desire to organize within the Cause a group that would circle around themselves , have refused to acknowledge the station of our beloved Guardian , Shoghi Effendi , and the New World Order of administration called into being by the Will of Abdu'l-Baha . Under the authority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against these " insidious adversaries " who have even gone so far as to flout the Beloved 's Will and Testament , the very pillar of our unity , by claiming the right to use the term " Baha'i " to designate their personal activities . The matter is therefore being taken to the courts , and as soon as possible their excuses will be made a matter of public record . It will be seen whether the present enemies of the Faith can succeed any better than those enemies who have preceded them : Subhi-Ezel , Mohamet Ali , Kheirella and their like , whose denial of the Truth became historic facts beyond recall . In connection with this legal action , we have this message from Shoghi Effendi in his cablegram of January 23 : " Praying victory similar ( to the ) one recently won ( over ) Covenant-breakers ( in ) Holy Land be achieved // by American believers over insidious adversaries ( in ) City ( of the ) Covenant . " For Bahais Only Before answering some of the accusations contained in the above extract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News . Every copy , in recent times , carries on its front page the inscription : For Bahais Only . Why for Bahais only , if the Bahai Cause is intended for the whole world ? Why for Bahais only , if there is nothing to hide ? Why for Bahais only , if this periodical is a credit to those who prepare it ? Abdul Baha on many occasions said that in the Bahai Cause there is no secret doctrine , and that there should be no secret society nor secret meetings . He never thought of specifying the point that there should be no secret publication : For men only , For members of the Klan only , For Bahais Only . Referring to Mr. and Mrs. Chanler and the members of The New History Society , the article states that a diminishing few urged by vaulting ambition and an obvious desire to organize within the cause a group that would circle around themselves . . . . At this point , I am close to becoming profane , but I will continue to hold the reins of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above statement is a mendacious falsehood , and the fraudulency of it is as evident to those who wrote it as it is to those of whom it was written . Vaulting ambition ! My soul ! A man and woman giving their hearts , minds and all that they possess in this world to spread an unwanted , though much-needed , cause ! Vaulting ambition ! Two persons bidding farewell to // their associates and friends to champion a movement that had been dragged , by its votaries , to the level of a narrow sect ! Vaulting ambition ! What did Mr. and Mrs. Chanler have to gain ! They had everything to lose . Yet in spite of all kinds of obstacles , laid by their fellow Bahais and others , they arose with such power and self-sacrifice to spread the Cause of Baha-O-Llah that it is difficult to measure or comprehend the height and depth of their love and devotion . I praise heaven that I was allowed the privilege of assisting them in their disinterested enterprise ; and so , I doubt not , do those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who thus have exposed themselves to this dishonest attack . Insidious adversaries ! The insidious adversaries are those who hold office in the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the United States and Canada . They are the ones who , through their legalistic verbiage , have stopped the circulation of the blood of life through the arteries of mankind ; they are the ones who have banished love from their midst and enthroned the Veiled Hatred which is more dreadful than the unveiled one ; they are the ones who have spread the pall of subtle fear and suspicion over the Bahai Community , exiling confidence and selfrespect ; they are the ones who , through political manipulations before and during annual Bahai Conventions , are re-elected to the same offices year after year ? thus , keeping a stranglehold on the activities of the Cause and directing those activities according to their own good-pleasure . The founders of The New History Society never , dur13 // ing the eleven years of the existence of the movement , have tried to organize within the Cause a group that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative structure have been emasculated to the point - where they are not worth organizing ; and then , The New History Society is not an organization . It sees the result of these tactics , and it remembers that the Bahai Cause was not intended to be an organization . The New History Society has marched across the longitude and latitude of the earth , sowing the seeds of the creative words of Baha-O-Llah without let or hindrance , and it has not withheld those who love organization to follow organization . In other words : Let the dead bury the dead ! The writer of the article in Bahai News reaches the height of his slanderous vilification when he likens Mr. and Mrs. Chanler and their Bahai friends to those enemies that preceded them : Subhi-Ezel , Mohamet 41i , Kheirel'la and their like . God Almighty ! Is it possible that a human mind could have framed this sentence ! Is it conceivable that a community , calling itself Bahai , can allow it to go unchallenged ! I address the members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : How did you dare , in the presence of Baha-OLlah , to print such blasphemies upon the pages of Bahai News ? Who drew up this article , and how did it come about that you put your signature to it ? This you call Bahai News ! It is a yellow sheet , a scandalous germ carrier ! No wonder that it is For Bahais only ! // Construction of the Word " Baha-O-Llah " Baha-O-Lla.h is a compound Arabic word consisting of Baha and Allah , literally meaning the light or the glory of God . Baha is an ordinary Arabic word which has been used in the literature and poetry of Arabia for innumerable centuries , and , of course , the word Allah is as ancient as Arabia itself . The word Baha is so well established that , when the Arabic translators of the Old Testament came to certain passages in that book , they rendered the words glory of God as Baha-O-Llah , and the glory of Carmel as the Baha of Carmel . See Isaiah , Chapter 3S , verse 2 ; likewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory of Carmel is translated into the Baha of Carmel , and the glory of our Lord is rendered into the Baha of our Lord . This can be verified by reference to any Arabic translation of the Old Testament . From this point of view , any Arab , knowing nothing of the Bahai Cause , can open a shop under the name : Bahai Foodshop or Bahai Drug Store or Bahai Bookshop , be-cause the words light and glory are current words in his language and he is at liberty to use them as have been his ancestors for centuries past . Historical Origin of the Name Bahai The Bahai Cause , as the movement is known today , was inaugurated in 1844 by Mirza All Mohammad , who adopted the title of the Bab , an Arabic word meaning gate , by which he implied that the gate to a new civiliza-tion was opened wide . A follower of his became known as a- Bahl , the addition of the letter i signifying in Persian // being of , or adhering to . Just as a native of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Esphahan is called Esphahani , so an adherent of the Bab was called Babi . When Mirza Hossein Ali , a disciple of the Bab , realized that he was inspired by God and that he must bring the message of light and glory to a harassed world , he adopted the title of Baha-O-Llah , by which he implied that the age of darkness , superstition , prejudice and ignorance was about to pass away and that a new era of understanding , harmony and union was dawning . The spiritual power of Baha-O-Llah was so tremendous that the majority of the Babis at once recognized in him the fulfillment of the prophecies of the Bab , which were to the effect that after him a yet greater personality would arise and take leadership . Therefore , these disciples gave their allegiance to Baha ( Baha-O-Llah often in his writings refers to himself simply as Baha ) and automatically they became Bahais . Likewise , the Babi Movement , from this time on , more and more became known as the Bahai Movement . The Bahai Cause Is Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was guided by Abdul Baha , the great son of Baha-O-Llah , it was taught as a free , non-sectarian Revelation , its door open to all mankind . The earlier Bahai booklets , now out of circulation but still to be found in the Public Library of New York , Sth Ave . and 42nd Street , carried a significant statement made by Abdul Baha . This statement may be found in a booklet entitled No. 9 , which was widely circulated in former years . // Now , this statement was so significant and far-reaching in its implications that it was continuously referred to by the Bahais in their speeches and writings ; and today there are many yet alive who , on numerous occasions , have heard Abdul Baha himself repeat it . Let us listen to the Master as he spoke : The Bahai Movement is not an organization . You can not organize the Bahai Movement . The Bahai Movement is the spirit of the age . It is the essence of all the highest ideals of this century . The Bahai Cause is an inclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found here . Christians , Jews , Buddhists , Mohammadans , Zoroastrians , Theosophists , Freemasons , Spiritualists , etc. , find their highest aims in this Cause , Socialists and philosophers find their theories fully developed in this movement . Mr. Horace Holley Mr. Horace Holley learned of the Cause during the lifetime of the Master ; after a meeting with Abdul Baha in Switzerland and a deep study of the teachings , he applied himself to the service of this nascent movement . His writings , work of those early years , present the Bahai Cause in a masterful and moving manner , and his later monumental tome Bahai Scriptures , published by Brentano 's in 1923 ( at present out of circulation ) , is an invaluable compilation . Likewise , the successive year books , entitled The Bahai World , prepared under his direction , and containing a wealth of interesting material to be found nowhere else , bear witness to his remarkable editorial talents . Since the departure from this life of Abdul Baha in // 1921 , Mr. Horace Holley has been the most dominant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step , - he has developed and refined this organism to the point where he now holds in his hand the threads of all the activities of the Cause in the East and in the West . Since 1921 , with the exception of a single year , if my memory serves me right , he has been elected year after year as the all-powerful secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the United States and Canada . I can call to mind but a single other instance where the occupant of so unpretentious an office as that of secretary maintained supreme and undisputed sway over the minds and lives of his community . This was in the case of Joseph Stalin , who also heads a movement which likewise is supposed to stand for social reform , and who , at the very pinnacle of power , retained the modest title of Secretary of the Communist Party . Mr. Horace Holley is a most efficient organizer ; he has been , and still is , the editor of various Bahai publications and as such he charts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As an influential member of the Bahai Reviewing Committee , he censors the writings of the Bahais and sees to it that no liberal or anti-organizational ideas penetrate the minds of the members of the various committees . In the exercise of this function , he always has the right and apt quotations , gathered here and there from the writings of Baha-O-Llah and Abdul Baha , ( writings which had been given out by these Great Teachers during an approximate period of sixty-five years and which applied to every condition imaginable , both universal and local ) and that is enough to prevent any objecTHE // tion or discussion . Under such circumstances , thought is paralyzed and no one dares to follow Baha-O-Llah 's injunction , ever repeated by Abdul Baha : Independent Investigation of Truth . Going back to the early years , we find a book , entitled : Bahai ? The Spirit of the Age , written by Mr. Horace Holley and published by Brentano 's in 1921 . Abdul Baha was still in our midst and , although the forces of organization were gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the horizon of the Bahai Cause , these were not ominous . Mr. Horace Holley was slightly affected , but he was as yet a free soul ? the charm and vision of Abdul Baha still held sway over his writings , as can be seen in the introduction to the abovementioned book where he gives six remarkable interpretations of the word Bahai . Let us for a moment commune with the departed spirit of Mr. Horace Holley : The new translation of an ancient classic contains one very significant change . A prophetic passage formerly interpreted " the end of the world " reads now " the end of the age . " In this sense , the world has indeed come to an end in our day ? the foundations of a new age , a new civilization , a new science and a new faith have visibly been laid . The inspiration of this new age , for many people in all parts of the world , has one source , one password , one mystery : the name Bahai . The word Bahai is like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a mansion with many rooms . For some , it means a set of principles necessary for // the peace of the world , for economic stability , for the true progress of the sciences and the arts . For others , Bahai means the privilege of belonging to an active movement already spread throughout the United States , Canada , Europe and large portions of the East ; a movement spreading the ideals of fellowship and service irrespective of race , creed , nationality and class . Still others feel in the word Bahai the reality , the consummation of the Sermon on the Mount , the return of the Divine Love for the purpose of raising mankind from its animal condition to the level of conscious spirituality . Behind this word for many there stands also a glorious Presence , a Divine Being whose title this word is : The Glory of God . These persons feel this Presence as the controlling force behind every event of this time . Thus is Bahai the cause of a new spirit of reverence and devotion , written as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosmic utterances which gather together those who seem to be a nucleus of the future spiritual race . Still others , having heard Abdul Baha during his travels through Europe and America immediately preceding the War , see the word Bahai in terms of his wisdom , his graciousness , his untiring efforts to awaken the slumbering soul to realize the opportunities and responsibilities of life in this age . Behind this word Bahai , finally , there is one of the most astonishing chapters History has ever had occasion to record . From its beginnings in the glorious Babi martyrdoms which occurred in Persia only about eighty years ago ; to that forty-year exile and imprisonment // suffered by Baha-O-Llah and Abdul Baha , with seventy faithful followers ; witnessing then the renaissance of the Holy Land as the " Mount of Revelation , " and arriving at the present hour with Abdul Baha 's unique mission made fruitful by the commencement of work on the Bahai Temple at Chicago , by the deeper comprehension of the meaning of this Cause awakened by the nationwide journey of the " Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread of the Bahai Message throughout the East ? the historic importance of these events can only be judged at some later date , when from this seed the fruitful tree shall have grown to its maturity . This was in 1921 . Seven years have rolled into the lap of eternity . The curtain is lifted on 1928 . The stage is set ! There is our old friend Mr. Horace Holley , urbane , subtle , conscious of his powers ? the arbiter and controller of the destiny of the Bahai Organization and Bahai Communities throughout the world . Yes , yes , he has done a good job ! With evident satisfaction he displays some papers . What are they ? Let us approach and examine them . Our attention is caught by one paper ? is riveted on it . We read : Registered Aug. 7 , 1928 Trade-Mark 254,271 United States Patent Office National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada of New York , N. Y. Application filed March 10 , 1928 . Serial No. 262,923. // BAHA'I STATEMENT To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States and Canada , a common-law corporation , organized and operated under declaration of trust and doing business at .. . As we read and re-read the statement , we are lost in a sea of amazement . We rub our eyes , we fidget , we feel restless ; we wonder whether all this is not a nightmare ? impossible , incredible . We stagger , and search in our consciousness for an explanation ; then , completely baffled , we look up into the face of Mr. Horace Holley . Maybe he will tell us what this means ! He smiles , triumphantly pointing to the signature , and we read : National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada by HORACE HOLLEY , Secretary . And as we turn our eyes from this document , we glimpse Mr. Horace Holley 's fingers still tenderly patting his own signature ! Well , friends ! It is accomplished ! There is a stake on the source of the Bahai Cause and its owner-proprietor is the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Baha-O-Llah , to be used for the regeneration of nations , is in the possession of the Bahai administrators . // No one on the face of the earth can fathom the mystery latent in the name Bahai except these interpreters of the law , these esteemed members of the all-powerful Bahai hierarchy . The jewel with hinny facets is boxed and locked , and the key is in the velvet pocket of Mr. Horace Holley . A concrete wall is raised around the fountain with many pitchers . Who cares ? Let the world die of thirst . The door of the mansion with many rooms is closed ! What if the children of God knock and knock ! What if they perish from punishing cold and hunger ; I , Mr. Horace Holley ; we , the members of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the United States and Canada ; we who follow the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the United States and Canada , we , we , we are living in the mansion of Baha-O-Llah ; we partake of his delectable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of principles necessary for the peace of the world , for economic stability , for the true progress of sciences and arts are registered and trade-marked , and woe unto those who dare to speak or write on these subjects ! The remedy given by the Great Physician for the healing of the sick body of the world has been made up into a patent medicine , and no one is allowed to avail himself of its restorative powers except by permission of these parochial pharmacologists . We , the members of the Bahai Organization , have a priority right on the ideals of fellowship and service irrespective of race , creed , nationality and class , and those who put these principles into practice are our insidious enemies . // Let the whole world know that we are the custodians of the reality , the consummation of the Sermon on the Mount . It is , of course , true that the Apostles of Christ did not copyright the Sermon on the Mount ; but , in those days , America was as yet undiscovered and there was no Commissioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the later Christians did not copyright the Sermon on the Mount , but in our opinion , some of them might have had the foresight to do it , thus preventing its circulation throughout the world except through authorized channels . Man lives and learns ! This word Bahai is the reality , the consummation of the Sermon on the Mount , and the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the United States and Canada are heirs to it ; they possess it , they have seignioral rights over it . Let us go back again to the early years , just for a breath of fresh air ! In another part of the already-mentioned book , Bahai ? the Spirit of the Age , Mr. Horace Holley writes as follows on pages 27-28 : The slightest appreciation of this Revelation , however , leads one to realize that the spirit of the age can not be thus conveniently confined . The slight Bahai Organization which exists is , in comparison with the Revelation itself , only as body in comparison to soul . Obviously , the cosmically conscious person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The basic principle of Abdul Baha 's teaching is : This is the century of spiritual Illumination . Its basic application is : Investigate Truth , Promote Peace , Proclaim the Oneness of Mankind . As a footnote to page 28 , Mr. Horace Holley quotes // these words of Abdul Baha : The Bahai Movement is not an organization . You can not organize the Bahai Movement . . . The Bahai Movement is the spirit of this age . ? Abdul Baha . The above masterful statement of Mr. Horace Holley was the expression of his faith in the Bahai Cause in 1921 . It happens to be the expression of my faith in 1941 , with one exception . He refers to slight Bahai Organization . Apparently , in spite of the clear statement of Abdul Baha that you can not organize the Bahai Movement , he and his associates had already introduced a slight organization and then , with the departure of the Master , the steamroller began to move , gaining momentum year by year ? until now . . . ( Additional material regarding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early appearance of orthodoxy and organizational ideas is given in a supplement at the end of this chapter , under the heading : The Building of Bahai Organization . ) My Faith The founders of the religions of mankind , including the Bahai Cause , never intended their teachings to be cornered by a group , a church , a synagogue , a mosque , a temple or an administration . The burden of their message was the abolition of the religious hierarchies of their times . They preached simplicity of faith and the abrogation of all ritual and credal distinctions ; but , invariably and without exception , the followers of the Masters fell into the same ditch , one by one . Baha-O-Llah wished his movement to be inclusive ; it was supposed to serve as a golden thread on which the ISO BROKEN SILENCI spiritual jewels of all religions were to be strung . He did not want to establish a new religion , to form another organization . He did not plan to forge another chain , to fabricate another creed , to build another jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home of my uncle , in which I was reared from the age of three months , was surrounded by the enemies of our Faith . In time , our house was pillaged and we were forced to leave Persia . Since my boyhood I have been a wanderer , a dervish , a vagabond . I own nothing , I possess no property , I have no bank account . The source of my wealth is my adoration for Baha-O-Llah ; the capital of my life is my devotion to Abdul Baha and this capital , no one , mark well , no one , no matter how protected , and no group , no matter how well organized , and no system , no matter how efficiently administered , can lessen or curtail . I served my master Abdul Baha for eight years in America and Canada , in Europe , Egypt and Palestine . I also served , and served well , the Bahais throughout the world , including those who today have the arrogance and insolence to classify me as an enemy . I have no apologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt me . My bones and my flesh are composed of the love of Abdul Baha , and through my veins and arteries the blood of the Bahai Cause runs red . I make no claim for myself ; I possess no title and hold no position . I am but a thrall at the Threshold of my Master ; and this servitude , pure and simple , is my claim to life and immortality . I know that Baha-O-L , lah is the protector of his on Cause . He guards over the treasures of his teachings . He does not need a board of trustees to administer his prinTHE // ciples nor to dispense his faith . His arms are outstretched over the wide universe and his spirit penetrates all things . Baha-O-Llah is my portion ; organization is the portion of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the United States and Canada . I am satisfied with my portion ; I hope that they are satisfied with theirs ! Yes , I and thousands of others have inherited the universal , all-inclusive teachings of Baha-O-Llah and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name are available to all who wish to use them , and Baha-O-Llah , from the Kingdom , smiles upon these children of his and is glad . These children of Baha , who are dedicated to his Cause , are like candles of guidance and wisdom which will burn but the brighter , surrounded as they are with a mesmeric gloom exorcised over the horizon by the waving of wands and the incantations of administrative soothsayers and magicians . The soft , lambent rays of these excommunicated souls will , in time , banish the darkness of the Abracadabra and Mumbo-jumbo , chaunted by weird sorcerers , cabalistic necromancers , sanctimonious Shamans , puritan witch-hunters , figure-flinger Cagliostros and fee-faw-fum medicine-men . Unique Distinction of the Bahai Cause The Bahai Cause , like all the great religions , contains a set of moral and ethical ideals for the spiritualizing of the life of mankind ; but , added to this and unlike other religions , Baha-O-Llah has given us clear and distinct principles for the radical improvement of the social , economic , political and educational conditions of our civiliza1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bahai Cause was not only a prophet , preaching and reiterating the absolute moral concepts of former dispensations , but was also an inspired statesman . We know that the major changes in our world have been brought about through the application of the three following methods : 1st . Spiritual education . This has been the method of all the prophets , including Baha-O-Llah . The introduction of ballot box and of voting does not belong to this category of teaching . 2nd . Recurrent violent and bloody revolutions . 3rd . Non-violent revolutions and change , through the adoption of the democratic way : ballot box and vote . The spiritual genius of Baha-O-Llah emphasized the first method ; rejected the second and accepted the third , recognizing its supreme value in our modern world . When we read his writings and those of his son , Abdul Baha , this point comes out very clearly . For instance , in regard to the exercise of our political rights , through voting , Abdul Baha says : Thou hast asked regarding the political affairs . In the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in elections ? This is a necessary matter and no excuse from it is possible . . . . As the government of America is a republican form of government , it is necessary that all the citizens shall take part in the affairs of the Republic . ? From the Book : " Tablets of Abdul Baha THE TRADE-MARK 1 5 S Abbas , " Vol . II , Pages 342-343 ; Published by Bahai Publishing Society , Chicago , III. , 1915 . The above instruction is plain enough and is in accord with essential democratic procedure . Yet in the face of it , the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the United States and Canada has taken the liberty of setting it aside . On the other hand , it has adopted the ballot box and voting for its own administrative wizardry , allowing its recognized members to elect national and local officers , while at the same time it deprives these very men and women of the privilege of exercising their rights as citizens in the election of officers in their local , state and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retain any political offices whatsoever , or to run for the same , thus abrogating their rights to serve their country and to uphold their democracy . To support the above statement , let us acquaint ourselves with a few of the regulations imposed upon its general membership by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the United States and Canada : I. Recognized Bahais of the United States and Canada must not take part in any local , provincial or national election , conducted by political parties , where votes are to be cast for one or two or more candidates . 2 . Recognized Bahais must not run for any public office as candidate of any political party , nor take part , directly or indirectly , in the promotion of any party or party platform . 1 56 BROKEN SILENCE 3 . Recognized Bahais must not vote in any election based upon a party system . 4 . Recognized Bahais must abstain from association with movements advocating social changes that presume partisan political action . 5 . Recognized Bahais who speak on Bahai platforms must abstain from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy . 6 . Every Local Bahai Center must be responsible for the carrying out of the above laws by the Bahais in their respective communities . Local membership must include only the names of those who faithfully obey these regulations . 7 . Recognized Bahais must not retain or apply for membership in any church or religious group . 8 . Bahais failing to give unreserved obedience to the above regulations and to numerous others which are constantly legislated , and month after month spread on the pages of Bahai News by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the United States and Canada , are expelled or excommunicated from the Cause , and the Bahais are not permitted to associate with these expelled or excommunicated ones , regardless of friendship , no matter of how long standing nor of the depth of their affection or love . In the light of the above rules , it is not difficult to picture the kind of society that would be ours if the Bahai community becomes widespread under the aegis of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this // country , of whatsoever political hue , red , brown , black or yellow , would take to his heart and cherish these deaf , dumb and blind subjects , utterly servile and subservient , who would never oppose him nor resist his most cruel laws or indeed his slightest whim . The citizenry of these proud United States would become a race of automata , a chaingang ; and our fair democracy would have been converted into a nightmare , more gruesome and frightful than could be imagined by any H. G. Wells in his most despondent mood . All this , in case the affairs of this country are influenced according to the ideology of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the United States and Canada . ( For the details of above regulations from Nos. 1 to 7 read " Bahai News , " December 1932 and July 1933 . For item No. 8 read article entitled " The Determination of Membership " on page 3 , January 1940 issue of " Bahai News . " ) The Alternative My personal opinion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disperse this sacrosanct hierarchy , to nullify its power and destroy its authority , it will ere long reduce the Bahai Cause to the status of a sect , seeing that it has now waxed so exceedingly puffed up with pride as to attack anyone who , before the face of his Maker , calls himself a Bahai . If a method be not devised to check the inordinate ambitions of these administrators of the Bahai Cause , they will , for the establishment of their own un-American , un-democratic ideology , so limit the spiritual potency of the words of Baha-O-Llah that the effect of these words on the hearts of men will be reduced to a whisper . // There are , indeed , men and women within the Bahai Organization , who had the privilege of listening to Abdul Baha and who are fully aware of the changed atmosphere and of the freezing of all spiritual life ; but the continuous droning of the black wings of organization and the undulations of the Administrative Python have paralyzed and incapacitated them . Bandar-log , said the voice of Kaa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye stir foot or hard without my orders ? Speak ! Without thy order , we can not stir foot or hand , 0 Kaa ! Good ! Come all one pace nearer to me . The lines of the monkeys swayed forward , helplessly . Nearer ! hissed Kaa , and they all moved again . Even so has the incorporated Kaa made soft , oozy triangles that melted into five sided figures and coiled mounds , never resting , never hurrying , while his fascinated audience , fearful of excommunication , have listened with rapt attention to every note of his low humming song . Excommunicated from what ? Is the earth indeed flat that they can be pushed off its surface ? Is the dominion of Baha-O-Llah so small that it can be reserved for a handful of respectable tenants ? Let these people awake and realize that humanity is encompassed with the vitalizing breezes of the New Day which refresh and bring joy to all who have love in their hearts ! When this knowledge dawns upon their consciousness , they will once and forever cast away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Universal Teachings of Baha-O-Llah , will take their places in the vanguard of freedom and progress , crying out : // Ya Baha El Abha ! as if for the first time . On the other hand , if this group is left to continue in its course of every day devising a new lock , of forging a new chain , of fashioning a new whip for application on the fair body of the Cause , then , I swear by the Almighty that Baha-O-Llah himself will arise in his Supreme Power and shatter these fetters to a thousand pieces , thus freeing his Message and setting it again to flow , like a tumultuous cyclone , through the wide avenues of life ! What Is the Bahai Cause ? The Bahai Cause is a free spiritual Revelation . BahaO-Llah , as its Founder , prayed that all men may partake of the inestimable blessings of his Message . This Message , in its essence , belongs to humanity , and no individual , no group of individuals , no church , no state , no organization , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be trade-marked , and it can not be patented . The song of the nightingale and the perfume of the rose defy the authority of a monopolistic junta . The rays of the stars can not be harnessed to the throbthrob of a powerhouse . The words of God are independent of the sponsorship of a corporation . The wind of the heavens bloweth where it listeth . It has neither a trade-name nor a trade-mark . It does not belong to a trade-union . It does not lend itself to trading , for it has no trading-post ; nor can it he discovered on the cardfiles of a trade-school . It is nameless and tradeless . Its 16o BROKEN SILENCE traces are lost in the cerulean sky and its traditions go back to the foundation of creation . The Bahai Cause is a summons to freedom in the realm of spirit . It is a clarion-call for the emancipation of all men from the limitations of the past . It is a lordly invitation to join in the march of the New Civilization . The Sea of Truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wonder before the boundless sea of the Cause of Baha-O-Llah , and we fill our small pitchers and are glad that God has made us witness to His measureless ocean of Truth . We pass by . Age after age , cycle after cycle , the children of other times and other climes shall stand before the same sea . They also fill their pitchers and pass by . The procession continues , yes , my dear Bahai friends , yes , my dear Bahai administrators , the procession continues on and on , century after century , throughout the eternity of time and space , until all the pitchers of all the children as yet asleep on the lap of God are filled to overflowing , yet the sea , ah me , the sea the limitless sea of the Truth of Baha-OLlah ? will still be there , untouched and undisturbed , mirroring on its marmorial surface the effulgence of the sun of Truth stationed at the meridian of its glory , and pouring its rays upon a world , the similitude of which can not be realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the above explanation we dimly , very dimly understand the meaning of the words of Abdul Baha : The Bahai Cause is the Spirit of the flge . Let us then close this chapter with his words which to me are words of truth : ? // Attach your hearts to Baha-O-Llah . He is the eternal Glory of God . Then from day to day , you will become more enlightened ; day by day your power will increase ; day by day your work will become more universal , and day by day your horizon will broaden , until in the end it will embrace the universe . ? Bahai by Horace Holley , pages 144-5 . Supplement THE BUILDING OF BAHAI ORGANIZATION Abdul Baha 's Definition of What is a Bahai ? When asked on one occasion : " What is a Bahai ? " Abdul Baha replied : " To be a Bahai means to love all the world ; to love humanity and try to serve it ; to work for universal peace and universal brotherhood . " On another occasion he defined a Bahai as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In one of his London talks he said that a man may be a Bahai even if he has never heard the name of Baha-O-Llah . He added : " The man who lives the life according to the teachings of Baha-O-Llah is already a Bahai . On the other hand , a man may call himself a Bahai for fifty years , and if he does not live the life he is not a Bahai . An ugly man may call himself handsome , but he deceives no one . " ? From the Book Baha-U-Llah and the New Era by J. E. Esselmont , Published by Brentano 's , New York . ( Mr. Esselmont spent two months and a half as the guest of Abdul Baha in Haifa in the winter of 1919-20 . His book is well written and one of the few that is still current and distributed by the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the United States and Canada. ) // The late Mr. Myron H. Phelps , one of the early Ameri-can pilgrims to Acca , writes in 1903 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , regarded as a religious leader , which is at once the most striking , the most attractive , and the most impressive , is his generous and tolerant liberality . It is disappoint-ing to find that narrowness and intolerance have already shown themselves in the teachings of some of his fol-lowers ? a perversion and degradation of true religion which is seen to be an almost inevitable tendency of human nature in all ages of the world , and which most religions have suffered in the hands of their adherents . The chief glory of Bahaism is that its true spirit , as ex-amplified in its Great Apostle , is utterly free from it . ? From the book Abbas Effendi , His Life and Teachings by Myron H. Phelps , published by G. P. Putnam 's Sons , New York , N. Y. , 1903 . Mr. Charles Mason Remey , Bahai teacher and world traveler , writes in 1912 : The method of Bahai teaching is constructive , in every sense . . . argument and dispute have no place in this cause .. . In order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . Fear , together with all its attending de-structive forces , disappears in the presence of faith and assurance ... . Having no organization , no ritual , or priesthood after the manner of other religions , the Bahais are opposing the work of no other religious bodies . It is a worldwide movement , the spirit of which is working unhindered // and unbound by confines and barriers of sect and ism . The Bahais see and recognize truth and spiritual beauty wherever found , and through this attitude of love and tolerance for all , they find at every hand , among the people of other religious bodies , the opportunity of sharing the spirit of their faith ... . Often people inquire whether affiliation with the Bahai Cause necessitates the giving up of church membership . The advice is always that no human or religious relations should be severed , but that these relations should become as avenues for giving forth the message and the spirit of the Bahai faith . People having church relations continue to mingle with church people ... . ? From the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. D. Milans and Sons , Washington , D. C. , 1912 . Mr. Remey is one of the earliest and most distinguished Bahai teachers and writers , and one who met Abdul Baha in person and received these principles from its fountain head . The above extracts from a most interesting chapter of his book show clearly and most truly the underlying ideals of tolerance and universality that inspired him and others to labor for the Cause of Baha-O-Llah . The late Mr. Alfred W. Martin , of the Ethical Culture Society , an admirer of the Bahai Cause , writes in 1926 : It is the crowning glory of the Bahai Movement that while depreciating sectarianism in its preaching , it has faithfully practiced what it preached by refraining from becoming itself a sect . Far from endeavoring to convert // all outside its fellowship to such doctrines as are generally held by the members ? whether of " theism , " or of " revelation , " or of " intuition ' as a criterion of truth ? it has assiduously sought to help men and women of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing could be more foreign to the spirit of this movement or further from its purpose than the attempt to displace all existing religions by itself . It frowns upon the notion that any one of the existing great religions will ever triumph over all the rest . And , far from bidding any one sever his connection with the religion he has inherited or adopted , the Bahai Movement bids him cling to it , so long as reason and conscience sanction his allegiance . Thus in the best sense of the word it is a missionary movement . Its representatives do not attempt to impose any beliefs upon others , whether by argument or by bribery ; rather do they seek to put beliefs that have illumined their own lives within the reach of those who feel they need illumination . No , not a sect , not a part of humanity cut off from all the rest , living for itself and aiming to convert all the rest into material for its own growth ; no , not that , but a leaven , causing spiritual fermentation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fraternalism ? such I take it is the essence of the Bahai Movement . Clearly , then , we are dealing with a fellowship , an influence , a leaven , a movement that fights shy of sectarian enthusiasms , that abhors the formation of a close corporation with exclusive privileges , for that has been a greater obstruction to brotherhood than either kingly ambition or commercial greed . This movement has no priesthood , no college , no ecclesiastical hierTHE // archy , but , on the contrary , is conspicuous for its distrust of organization , constitutions , by-laws , and other familiar fetters of the western world . But I see foreboding signs , I hear disquieting rumors of a tendency among some within this movement to have it crystallized within a sectarian mold , to have it stand explicitly for a certain set of theological ideas , and then make this the test of fellowship . No more serious or fateful calamity could befall this movement than to have it relegated to the limbo of sectarianism . Let it hold fast to its distrust of organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it an ever increasing field of usefulness but , forfeiting none of its beneficent power , it will go on from strength to strength in the fulfillment of its invaluable and indispensable mission . ?

WILHELM , DOROTHY BAKER , AMELIA COLLINS , LOUIS GREGORY , LEROY C. IOAS , HARLAN OBER and SIEGFRIED SCHOPFLOCHER , as members of the National Spiritual Assembly and Trustees of the Baha'is of the United States and Canada , and THE SPIRITUAL ASSEMBLY OF THE BAHA'IS OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK , a religious corporation , Plaintiffs , against MIRZA AIIMAD SOHRAB AND JULIE CHANLER , Defendants . The Morning of April 1st 1941 On April 1st , I as usual left my room at an early hour and , after a walk through Central Park , arrived at the office at 8:3o . Presently Mrs. Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler , my partner in the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite side of the desk and we both set ourselves to examining our mail . At 9 : 3o the telephone rang . In routine fashion , I lifted up the receiver : " Hello ! " 166 // " Mrs. Chanler , please 1 " It was a masculine voice . " Who is calling ? " " This is Greenwald , of Kleeberg &; Greenwald . " With a slight tremor of excitement , I pushed the telephone over to Mrs. Chanler and narrowly watched her as she took up the conversation . " No ! " A smile had broken over her face . " Is it really true ? . . . Really ? " . . . Her eyes sought mine and she whispered Allah-O-fl bha ! ; then she continued : " Naturally , we 'll come down . . . . How could it be any trouble ? .. . Have n't we been waiting for this news long enough ? .. . Yes , in twenty minutes , and thank you a thousand times . " She put down the receiver and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The Court has decided in our favor . " Her eyes were shining ; mine were already wet with tears . Across the desk , our hands met and gripped each other and I broke out : " Thank God ! Baha-O-Llah has freed his Cause ! " Meanwhile our secretary , Miss Lilyan Tannen , had stopped her work to listen . No one knew better than Miss Tannen the various stages in the proceedings which had led to this outcome . Had n't she been sitting in that very place sixteen months before , when we had been served with papers ; and , during the long course of litigation , had n't she felt , as had all our friends , that there could n't be any other decision ? Just the same , confidence and certainty are vastly different . We knew it then ; and we were three very happy people on that morning of April 1st , 1941 . Before leaving the house , we shared our news with Mr. Chanler who was very delighted , although he insisted on taking it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off // down Lexington Avenue where , adepts at the subway as we are , we took the wrong line , and emerged at Times Square instead of at the Grand Central . We put this slip down to pardonable bewilderment and did our best to catch up for lost time , arriving a little breathless at the offices of Kleeberg &; Greenwald , Counsellors at Law , 300 Madison Avenue , at exactly quarter past ten . Mr. Greenwald , who had argued the case in court , was awaiting us and he , most sympathetically , spread before our eyes the New York Law Journal of that morning which carried the decision handed down by Justice Louis A. Valente in the Supreme Court , New York , on the suit brought by the Bahai Administration against ourselves . While we were reading the clear-cut findings of the Judge , Mr. Kleeberg looked in and we had the opportunity of thanking our two lawyers who were so well qualified to handle a case of this unusual type ; and all the time we were conscious of the fact that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten in the records of Bahai history . On the way back , Mrs. Chanler and I , still in a state of pardonable bewilderment , lost each other and we returned by different routes . The Complaint On December 5 , 1939 , Allen B. McDaniel , Horace Holley , Roy C. Wilhelm , Dorothy Baker , Amelia Collins , Louis Gregory , Leroy C. Ioas , Harlan Ober and Siegfried Schopflocher , as the nine members of the National Spiritual Assembly and the Trustees of the Bahais of the United States and Canada , together with the Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the City of New York , a religious corTHE // poration , brought a lawsuit against Mrs. Chanler and myself . The primary object of this proceeding was to prevent us from using the word Bahai in connection with a Book Shop and to restrain us and the group formed under the name of The New History Society from holding any meetings in the name of the Bahai Cause or for the purpose of teaching the principles of Baha-O-Llah and Abdul Baha . This action was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered the word Bahai as a trade-mark in the United States Patent Office , Washington , D. C. The Complaint , served on April 25th ; the Amended Complaint , presented on June 7th ; the Bill of Particulars , produced on August 27th ; the Supplemental Bill of Particulars , added on October 3oth , and the final Memorandum , submitted to the Court on December 27 , 1940 , by an array of attorneys , namely : Watson , Bristol , Johnson and Leavenworth of 6 East 45th St. , New York , display a shifting of attitude very perplexing to the student of these documents . The lawsuit started out on the basis of the trade-mark held on the word Bahai , but this definite claim was dropped in the Amended Complaint and in all subsequent Papers . The same process of elimination on other claims is followed , more or less regularly , in the series of briefs , showing that the plaintiffs were laboring under confusion of thought and purpose . Baseless assertions and fantastic allegations were advanced as facts ; but no proofs were offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the City of New York , who were intimately acquainted with the questions involved , were able to swear the following before Notary Publics : I have read the // foregoing Complaint ( or ' Intended Complaint ) and know the contents thereof , and the same is true of my own knowledge except as to the matters therein stated to be alleged upon information and belief , and as to those mat-ters I believe it to be true ; yet hundreds of New York 's public , knowing the situation but slightly , would have been willing to go on record , stating that some of these charges were obviously not true . At any rate , according to the Court no facts were ever produced and no good cause of action was ever advanced . As one studies these documents , one comes to the reali-zation that the plaintiffs are obsessed with a single thought and purpose , namely : that Baha-O-Llah came to earth to form an organization and that his teachings are to be monopolized by them . This line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy , runs throughout all their demands . They believe that our unlawful public teaching of the Bahai Cause is trespassing upon their rights and privileges and works to their damage and injury ; and they consider that , if we are permitted to continue in these unlawful acts , the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the United States and Canada and the Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the City of New York will suffer irreparable injury . Spiritual and Material Monopoly To illustrate this point I will quote one from among their many demands of the Court , which is embodied in the Amended Complaint : ? // WHEREFORE plaintiffs demand judgment as follows : ( 1 ) That the defendants and each of them , their agents , servants , employees , associates , and each of them be enjoined and restrained , during the pendency of this action and thereafter perpetually . a . From using , or participating directly or indirectly in the use of , the word Baha'i , or any word deceptively similar thereto , as the name or a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social gathering or as the name or title or a part of the name or title of any book , magazine , or other publication , or as the name or a part of the name under which any book shop or other business is conducted . b . From representing in any way that either of the defendants is connected with or authorized to represent the plaintiffs or the Baha'i religion or Cause . c . From soliciting or receiving any form of financial contribution to the Baha'i religion or Cause . ( 2 ) That the defendants and each of them be directed to account for , and pay over to the plaintiffs , the sums received by the defendants , the profits realized by the defendants and the damages suffered by the plaintiffs as the result of the wrongful acts herein alleged , together with plaintiffs ' costs herein . ( 3 ) That plaintiffs have such other and further relief as may be equitable . Here , we have a clear example of both spiritual and material monopoly . The plaintiffs were determined to deprive us ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Baha-O-Llah ; they wished to close the doors // of our meetings , to scatter our members and friends , to silence our voices , to haul down our flag , and then to receive , as balm for their feelings , whatever contributions we had received and whatever profits we had made , together with further relief as may be equitable . Off the Record At this point , I will make a statement which was not included in our defense before the court : The New History Society is not a commercial organization ; it is not even a practical organization ; neither Mrs. Chanler nor myself are fitted by temperament to conduct a movement based on the material support of its membership or the public . This is a weakness on our part of which I am not proud , but it is a fact , nevertheless . During the eleven years of the existence of The New History Society and the ten years of the existence of The Caravan ( its affiliated youth movement ) , Mr. and Mrs. Chanler have poured in their money freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavor . Small contributions to the work came in now and then , from our members , some books were sold and the proceeds added to the budget , but ninety-nine and threequarters percent of the total expended on the maintenance of the work came from the one source ? Mr. and Mrs. Chanler . Everybody knows this ; and yet the plaintiffs claim that we have made profits , and diverted to ourselves contributions to the Bahai Cause which otherwise would have been received by them . All these allegations were under oath . Here , one can not help wondering at the mental processes which make such claims and oaths possible . // The fact that we never did make money or profits was not made use of in our defense before the Court . Instead , our lawyers claimed for us the right to collect funds for Bahai work , and this claim was granted in the decision . So , the Court did not confer upon the plaintiffs a spiritual and material monopoly on the Bahai Teachings : the Cause , for which we are ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor were our possessions ( incidentally , mine are nil ) confiscated under the guise of profits , damages , cost of litigation and further relief as may be equitable . Complete Assurance A most incomprehensible aspect of the design of the National Spiritual Assembly was utter confidence in the justice of its plan and complete assurance of victory . One reason for this apparent confidence was , I suspect , the small weight which its members placed on the guarantee of religious liberty in this country as set forth in the Bill of Rights , together with a minimizing of the effect which this law of tolerance had had on the consciousness of the American people . Even if they were aware of the implications of this principle , they , in all probability , imagined that it could be brushed aside in their case by reason of the authority of the Guardian ; and here we come to the basis of their assurance . Believing as they do in the infallibility of Shoghi Effendi , and having pinned all their faith on the validity of his judgment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent by him in this connection constituted their safeguard . Here are the texts of the cablegrams : ? Received December 13 , 1939 , Praying ( for ) success ( of ) legal measures taken by Assembly . Received January 18 , 1940 , Sleepless vigilance ( to ) ward off subtle attacks ( of ) enemies ( is ) first prerequisite ( to ) sound unfoldment ( of the ) process ( of the ) enterprise already operating . Received January 23 , 1940 , Praying victory similar ( to the ) one recently won ( over ) covenant-breakers ( in ) Holy Land be achieved by American believers over insidious adversaries ( in ) City of ( the ) Covenant ( i. e. , New York ) . ( The above three cablegrams are quoted in the Bill of Particulars in order to prove the fact that the suit had been brought with the approval and authorization of Shoghi Effendi . ) Further , in a letter written from Haifa , Palestine , on April 15th and published in Bahai News , June 1940 , the Guardian has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtle and contemptible machinations by which the puny adversaries of the Faith , jealous of its consolidating power and perturbed by the compelling evidences of its conspicuous victories , have sought to challenge the validity and misrepresent the character of the Administrative Order embedded in its teachings , have // galvanized the swelling army of its defenders to arise and arraign the usurpers of their sacred rights and to defend the long-standing strongholds of the institutions of their Faith in their home country . I do n't feel that I can make comment on the above paragraph other than to address myself to the adjective puny , which is a quaint word of early English flavor . In looking it up , I find that it signifies imperfectly developed , pigmy , shrimp , small fry . Now , I know that Mrs. Chanler , in her modesty , would accept all these terms as descriptive of her , in her service to the Cause , but neither she nor I agree to them in regard to our worth as opponents to the system which thinks to he the unique repository @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the attorneys of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahais of the United States and Canada give us credit for being adversaries ( in a purely legal way ) , at least , worthy of their steel . Reasons for Bringing Suit Shortly after the institution of legal proceedings , the National Spiritual Assembly explains its reasons for bringing action against us , stating that this step represents a culmination of one aspect of the evolution of the Faith . I do think that they were right in this respect . Under the authority of the Guardian , the time has now come to act against these " insidious adversaries " who have even gone so far as to flout the Beloved 's Will and Testament , the very pillar of our unity , by claiming the right to use the term Bal.a'i to designate their personal activities . // The matter is therefore being taken to the courts , and as soon as possible their excuses will be made a matter of public record . It will be seen whether the present enemies of the Faith can succeed any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Signed ) National Spiritual Assembly . Bahai News , Feb. 1940 , No. 133 The decision to take legal action for the protection of the Sacred right of the Baha'i community represents a culmination of one aspect of the evolution of the Faith in recent years which the newer believers have had little occasion to consider or understand . To the older Baha'is , however , the preservation of the basis of the unity and integrity of the community is a matter vital to faith and inseparable from the experience of loyalty and service to the Cause . For they have witnessed actual efforts to deny the validity of Abdu'l-Baha 's mission and question the authority of His station . They have realized vividly and poignantly how the very existence of the Faith depends on loyalty to whosoever has received appointment from the Manifestation . They have experienced the necessity of gathering their forces in order to assert the truth and preserve the community from destruction . Such an experience is forever unforgettable , for it means that conscious choice has been made between light and darkness in the spiritual world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clear : the claim on the part of non-Baha'is that there are no qualifications of faith in this Cause , but any one is a Baha'i who asserts that he is ; and that there is no criterion by which to distinguish between authentic Baha'i literature and literature which some one assumes is
