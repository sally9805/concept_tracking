A bare four days before the opening of Prague 's International Music Festival , music-loving Czechs got an impressive answer to a question they had been asking for a year : Whom will the Russians send ? The answer came in a red-starred C-47 direct from Moscow : Russia had sent thin , 40-year-old Dmitri Shostakovich , one of the world 's five greatest living composers. * <P> In spite of his efforts to stay out of the limelight , shy Dmitri Shostakovich stole the show . One of the festival 's big events was his Eighth Symphony , conducted by friend Eugene Mravinsky ( to whom the Eighth is dedicated ) , conductor of the Leningrad Philharmonic . When the Czech radio recently played the Eighth , the score was altered because it was considered too difficult to play ; this time Mravinsky brought along his own score . <P> Composer Shostakovich attended most of the festival 's 38 concerts , but stood unobtrusively in the rear of the hall during rehearsals of his own works . In his free time , he browsed in Prague music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper party at the U.S. Embassy , where he ate a lot , drank little , showed a great liking for American cigarets . <P> Not Banned , Not Played . He made one speech , to the International Congress of Composers , but anyone who expected to hear new theories or techniques was disappointed . Blinking myopically under the klieg lights , he read a dull account of the bureaucratic organization of Soviet music , not once mentioning himself . At the end , someone asked : " Is your opera Lady Macbeth of Mzensk banned in Russia ? " Said Shostakovich quietly : " It is not banned-it is simply not played . " There was an embarrassed silence ; considering the blast directed at Lady Macbeth by Soviet ideologists eleven years ago ( " Screaming , neurotic music " ) , it was hardly a nice question . Shostakovich made an abrupt bow and walked from the stage . <P> But last week , when he rose from the piano after playing some of his chamber works with a touch that was firm and decisive , he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Marshal Konev liberated the city two years ago . The tribute was not so much for the compositions he had played ( they were slight pieces ) but for his past contribution to music . For half an hour the crowd clapped , cheered and shouted , bringing him back again &; again to take nervous , bobbing little bows . Once he stumbled over the dais and almost fell headlong on the stage in his haste to retreat . Said one Czech , who saw a lot of him : " He gives you the impression that more than anywhere else in the world he would be happiest on a desert island , completely alone . "
