txt " No Speeding " and " No Drinking " are two traffic signals raised today by Rudolph F. King , Massachusetts Registrar of Motor Vehicles , for Bay State motorists to read and heed during this holiday season . Faced with mounting evidence in statistical records that the two major reasons for the 1947 record Of fatalities are excessive speed and driving while under the influence of liquor , Mr. King asks for caution to temper the year-end celebrations . In preparing his annual figures for release about New Year 's Day , the Registrar noted that drunken drivers were responsible for 91 highway fatalities during the first 11 months of 1947 . That is 25 more than last year , according to Mr. King . During that same period , almost 4,000 convictions have been obtained in the courts against drunken drivers . Licenses and registrations have been either revoked or suspended for driving after drinking to the total of 6,453 , Mr. King stated . At the current rate of increase in the volume of drunken driving ? convictions having risen 35 per cent over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with considerable alarm . " The statistics on speeders are equally sensational , he said . Nearly 11,000 licenses have been suspended for speeding this year compared with only 8,375 in 1946 . The two- and three-time speeders are also being arrested in greater numbers . Whereas only one license was suspended in 1946 for second offenders at speeding , 99 were caught this year , Mr. King figured . With car registrations . at the highest peak in State history , there may be some reason for the increased number . ' of reckless drivers on the highways , Mr. King said . But so far as he is concerned , there is no excuse for anyone driving faster than is safe for highway conditions , or for drinking before getting behind the driving wheel . According to the Registrar 's records , there have been 485 fatalities on the highways this year against 474 last year . Almost 20 per cent of these were due , he said , to drunken drivers . This constitutes a problem in enforcement which Mr. King could see no answer to without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws to keep these drivers off the road .
