Last week in San Francisco 's harbor lay the Kwang Yuan , a 28 year-old tramp three-master . Her deck machinery was rusted tight by rain , barnacles were four inches deep on her rusty hull . In the captain 's quarters lounged " Captain " Chan Tze-ming ; in the engine room " Chief Engineer " Wang Chi-fu reigned over nosy harbor rats and cold , dry engines . It was the Kwang Yuan 's third year at anchor . <P> Three years ago Chan Tze-ming and Wang Chi-fu signed on in Chefoo , China , with 18 other Chinese , to sail the Kwang Yuan . The crew discovered that the " Chinese " company which had bought the craft had placed aboard three Japanese officers , learned in San Francisco the Kwang Yuan was to carry 2,100 tons of scrap iron to an Osaka ( Japanese ) munitions factory . <P> Straightway trouble broke ; heads were cracked , noses bloodied in a miniature Sino-Japanese war ; the Japanese captain skipped . The " Chinese " owners tried to have the crew arrested for mutiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over boats flying the Chinese flag . Messrs . Chan and Wang were promoted to captain and chief engineer respectively ; the other hands sailed on other ships . <P> Last week , as he has every week since 1938 , " Captain " Chan climbed over the side , rowed solemnly ashore , asked with impassive Oriental punctilio for sailing orders . As always , there were none . For the Kwang Yuan there may never be any . " Captain " Chan bowed politely , bent his oars back to his command .
