Like Daniel , the Federal Council of Churches put its faith in the Lord and walked right in with the lions . <P> In the conference rooms of Pittsburgh 's William Penn Hotel last week , the Council brought together veteran representatives of management &; labor-Movie Czar Eric Johnston , President Paul G. Hoffman of the Studebaker Corp. , C.I.O. Research Director Kermit Eby , A.F.L. Research Director Boris Shishkin . Altogether , some 370 delegates-about two-thirds laymen - representing 27 Protestant denominations showed up at the conference . <P> In polite tones seldom used across the industrial bargaining table , the delegates aired views ranging from moderate left to far right . But a cooperative spirit prevailed . ( The hotel shortage forced a New Haven publisher and a Michigan CVLO official to share a single room . ) <P> The lions ' den was not quiet enough , however , to put Daniel to sleep . Church leaders , asking the industry and labor men to think of their problems " from God 's viewpoint , " were occasionally disturbed by such cries from the floor as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Council 's new President Charles P. Taft , bossing his first meeting , had to be firm to keep delegates on the subject . <P> After talking for three days about " The Church and Economic Life , " the conferees issued a report on the church 's duty to its neighbors , the factory and the farm . Much of the report was a watered-down version of England 's famed Malvern Conference findings in 1941 . But a few forthright statements showed how Christian principles can provide an area of agreement for the economic antagonists of industrial society : <P> Full employment : " Each person under God has a right and a duty to take his share in the world 's work . . . . The responsibility to provide the opportunity to work rests on all segments of our society . " <P> Production aims : " Production exists to serve necessary and desirable consumption . . . . Profits . . . are thoroughly defensible , subject to proper methods of accumulating and distributing them . " <P> Property rights : " Property represents a trusteeship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of ownership are difficult to regulate for the common welfare , consideration should be given to further experimentation in . . . private , cooperative and public ownership . " <P> Labor unions : " Economic groups should have the right to organize , if . . . their purpose and activities do not contravene the welfare of the entire community . " <P> Voted down by a single ballot : a statement condemning " excessive concentration of wealth . " Overwhelmingly voted down : amendments to put the conference on record as opposed to the closed shop .
