To really advanced physicists , nuclear fission is old , dull stuff . What excites them now is " ultra-nucleonics , " study of " the elementary particles within the atom which are capable of releasing thousands of times as much energy as is produced by the nuclear fission on which the A-bomb is based . " To these men , trained in the esoteric mysteries of quantum mechanics , all matter is merely condensed energy . It is formed by the interaction of waves , and to waves it can return . What a triumph it would be , they speculate , to turn matter all at once into waves of energy . <P> Role of the Meson . Last week 500 ultra-physicists gathered in Manhattan at a meeting of the American Physical Society to discuss this unfinished business . The meson ( pronounced mees-on ) was the star of the convention . Most physicists agreed that this subatomic particle , which weighs 200 times as much as an electron , was the key to the problem . <P> Little is definitely known about mesons , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere . One theory : cosmic rays hit air atoms , knock high-speed protons out of their nuclei . These hit other atomic nuclei , somehow producing mesons . Mesons live only two-millionths of a second ; then they disintegrate with a burst of energy . All , or nearly all , the matter in.the meson spontaneously turns into energy . If physicists could generate mesons on a large scale , their great problem might be solved . <P> The only reliable meson generators are the mysterious cosmic rays from outer space , which spend most of their force inconveniently high in the atmosphere . <P> V-2 Report . Luckily for the ultra-physicists , the U.S. Army , hell-bent for high-altitude guided missiles , was cooperating . Last week the Army told good news . A German V-2 rocket , roaring 100 miles above New Mexico , had carried elaborate instruments to the realm of the cosmic rays . Twenty miles up , the effect of the rays was 300 times as strong as on the earth ; 20 miles higher it fell off again . <P> The V-2 's report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the top it showed the original cosmic rays , but comparatively few in number . Lower down , they had smacked into atoms , set swarming particles flying . Lower still , their effect had largely died away . <P> The data would be studied with bated breath , would yield new understanding of the birth of mesons . Eventually , perhaps , the grateful physicists might repay the Army with a cataclysmic meson-bomb.
