Reported an eyewitness from the Big Four conference room : " Sometimes the boys waggle a finger at each other , but they are n't pounding any tables . " <P> The Foreign Ministers reached agreement on some minor Italian treaty matters ( sample : disposition of Italian literary rights in allied territory ) , but were still at odds on most major ones . The Trieste issue was tabled , in the hope that it would be resolved by a last-minute Yugoslav compromise maneuver ( see map box ) . <P> The most significant decision was procedural : the Ministers would set aside their disagreements on each treaty , pass on to other treaties and attempt to work out all remaining disagreements later . Obviously , this process gave more latitude for horse-trading , however remote it might be from a peace based on justice .
