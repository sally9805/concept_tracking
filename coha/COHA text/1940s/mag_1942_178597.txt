NBC last week was inclined to think Henry Agard Wallace a pretty good idea man . A new program series , worked up at his suggestion , turned out to be the mail-getter of the week . What was more , it belonged to a class of program in which U.S. networks have usually been mediocre or worse . The show was in fact a lot fresher than its title , Down Mexico Way ( Sat . 4 to 4:30 E.W.T. ) . <P> Vice President Wallace 's idea came to him on his visit to Mexico in 1940 . Like many a language student before him , he discovered that songs improve the ear , enlarge the vocabulary and warm the heart . Mexican popular songs are good . Mr. Wallace listened , learned , sang . One evening last autumn he talked to NBC 's Executive Frank Mullen about a radio program to teach Spanish that way . <P> Hardbitten , bright-eyed Mr. Mullen set NBC 's assembly lines in motion . Fortnight ago the ' Wallace dream boat slid down NBC 's ways with launching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican Ambassador , and Mr. Wallace . At network stations the National Federation of Music Clubs , the National Federation of Business &; Professional Women 's Clubs held listening parties . <P> They heard the opening adventure , in Jalisco , of a good-natured young man from the U.S. By the end of the half-hour , boy had met girl ( Mexican ) , had danced , heard much music , learned some handy Spanish words and phrases and at least one simple song . Last week 's chapter , laid in Michoacan , taught him another . As the radio audience was informed , all songs used in the eight-week series can be had on records . <P> Down Mexico Way managed to be primer-like but not too cute . An offer to send the text of its songs in Spanish and English drew 1,700 letters last week . Students of Spanish could take heart from the fact that its Mexican tone was achieved by an Irish-born script writer ( McDonagh ) , a Canadian-born director ( Corday ) , and a cast whose ingenue ( Gould ) was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
