From the Klondike the Yukon River brawls across the U. S. border into desolate interior Alaska at the town of Eagle. * Here is tough country . At times spirit thermometers show cold of 70 below zero , and lower . The Arctic Circle is only 100-odd miles north ; friendly Fairbanks is 200 bitter miles west . Few sourdoughs and no chechakhos live on these rolling tundras , where the ground is frozen several hundred feet down-country in which Chechakho Jack London starved and froze , seeking gold and finding stories . <P> Tough as a mukluk ( fur boot ) was Sourdough Edwin A. Robertson , a Maine-born man who had lived most of his 84 years in Yukon country . Fortnight ago , Sourdough Robertson left his lonely cabin on Seventymile River , mushed for Eagle to lay in supplies . The air was deadly cold ; spicules of ice rimed the oldtimer 's whiskers . Warily he plodded . He knew his Yukon , knew that while the running creeks freeze solid early , little springs that never freeze bubble under the snow all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet that would freeze almost instantly unless he could build a fire . <P> To be able to build a fire in that country is to be able to live . All Alaskans know that . Sourdough Robertson knew it . The bulging sun , which had popped up over the south horizon for a few hours , slid down again . Night came on . In the distance trotted black shadows-wolves . The oldtimer decided to camp beside a little stream . Something went wrong . He could n't light a fire . Perhaps his old hands numbed too quickly when he jerked them out of the mittens to strike matches ; stayed numb no matter how he pounded them together . Perhaps his little sticks were wet . But his fire would not start . That , quite simply , was death . The wolves came closer , their shadows black on the snow , shadows that merged , sprang apart , drifted closer . <P> Chechakho London would have approved of Sourdough Robertson , who knew he must die , but begrudged his body to the wolves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had deliberately lain down in the stream , let the freezing water trickle over him as he settled down to sleep . The tracks of baffled wolves were all around , but the body of Sourdough Robertson was encased peacefully in ice . <P> <P> *Into Eagle , after a 500-mile trek from Herschel Island , mushed beak-faced Explorer Roald Amundsen in December 1905 , with news that he was three-fourths of the way around the Northwest Passage-goal of explorers since 1576.
