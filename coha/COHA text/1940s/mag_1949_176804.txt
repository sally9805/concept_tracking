( See Cover ) <P> A free nation 's decision is slow in the making , and no one knows certainly on what day of what month a people makes up its mind . Its decision is the slow growth of conviction in many minds , the slow swelling of resolve in many hearts . It is reached not at the green-topped tables of state , but at the corner store and the village market , at the tea table and the union meeting . It is taken by corporations examining their books , by housewives scribbling a market list , by farmers squinting at a crop of wheat . Until the voice of a free people is heard clearly , few major decisions of statesmen can carry the power of democracy 's full force . <P> Firm Resolve . In the year 1948-a fitful year in a nervous century-historians could record that a mass of U.S. intentions , promises and pledges had hardened into resolve and action . In 1948 , the world 's greatest nation of free men finally resolved to meet Communism 's deadly challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the struggle against Communism required war , the U.S. would fight . <P> In 1948 , the U.S. Congress passed and the U.S. President signed the Economic Cooperation Act , called by England 's Economist " an act without peer in history . . . of inspired and generous diplomacy . " What had been promised in the Marshall Plan became solid fact , and the U.S. moved into its massive counterattack against the enemy . <P> In 1948 , under savage and provocative Russian pressure in Berlin , the U.S. refused to abandon Europe 's helpless peoples . With that decision , the U.S. accepted the risk of war . Major General William H. Tunner 's airlift blazed a roaring , dramatic demonstration of U.S. determination across Europe 's troubled skies . Not only to Berliners but to the world , the Berlin airlift was the symbol of the year : the U.S. meant business. * <P> No Dissent . Grimly and regretfully , the country shouldered the burden of a record peacetime rearmament . In little issues and big , the signs of the people 's decision were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its approval on a massive Air Force , Army and Navy-without a whisper of partisan dispute in an election year . <P> Through the acts of two widely disparate individuals , the last trace of doubt about the nature of the enemy had disappeared . In Czechoslovakia , Jan Masaryk jumped to his death , the tragic figure of thousands of men of good will who stubbornly held to the theory that the liberal can work with the Communist . In Manhattan , a distraught Russian schoolteacher leaped from an upper window in the Soviet consulate to escape return to Russia . More than speeches , reports or eyewitness accounts of life under Communism , her act nakedly revealed the bitter despair behind the glowing promises in Communism 's workers ' paradise .
