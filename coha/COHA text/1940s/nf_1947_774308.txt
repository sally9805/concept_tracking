txt  | own company , actually producing and selling fabrics made by mills she directs . The name of Dorothy Liebes is best known for her decorative fabrics , but occasionally she designs for clothing . In 1944 she made a special group of fabrics for Adrian , the Los Angeles creator . She believes that anything that can be woven is adaptable for fabric , and therefore uses novelty yarns , ribbons , and sometimes flowers . Most of her designs are hand-woven , with the result that she is not restricted to the limitations of standard-size yarns and power looms . An affiliation with the Jantzen Knitting Company enlarges the scope of her activities . Hope Skillman , who for eight years worked with an important converter creating fabrics for the better manufacturers , in 1943 founded her own converting firm specializing in cottons . Again , because she has been able to produce textures and weaves that have not been on the market , she must be regarded as a fabric designer . For instance , in 1943 she made gingham in tartan plaids with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-style fabric used by leading designers in important town dresses . Her fabrics among cottons have the same character that fine taffetas and novelties have among silk fabrics . Rayon fabrics are also included in her line . Pauline Madoc , stylist for Catoir Silks , is a woman whose talents and experience enable her to assist in creating new textures in silks and rayon fabrics . Formerly a designer for the great Parisian house of Ardanse , she designs not only fabrics but custom-made clothes as well . Mimi Blaker , working with the cotton goods firm of Galey and Lord , Inc. , carries on work with clothing designers and salesmen and talks to consumers , salesgirls , and buyers , in addition to designing fabric . Her work of creating new effects in plaids and checks is no easy task . Motifs can not successfully be painted on these , as they can on print cloths , but must rather be worked out with colored yarn . Miss Blakey is one of the few successful women fabric designers in the cotton market .  | California Designers Location The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with many men and women demanding well-designed clothing for stage productions and their personal wardrobes ; the number of sports enthusiasts there ; the brilliant colors of the flowers and shrubs ; and the invigorating climate all provide a stimulating setting for California designers which helps to account for the fact that the Los Angeles fashion market alone is regarded by some as the coming center for the manufacture of certain lines of apparel . Southern California is a year-round vacation resort . The tradition of motion picture premieres provides occasions for the display of clothes and jewelry . Film stars and would-be stars vie with each other in the extravagance of their costumes . The Santa Anita race track provides another setting for western fashion leaders and for those who follow their dictates . Concerts in the Hollywood Bowl , where the world 's best musicians play , are attended by persons from all walks of life from the leading movie stars and producers to the school children and poorest dwellers in the community . The climate calls for play clothes of every kind and also those for leisure wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing new designs , if there is a reason for their being . Retailers and the people who live on the west coast are less Parisminded than easterners . For instance , the cowboy wears his dungarees or levis with chaps , his colorful shirt , scarf and broad brimmed Stetson hat . It is not surprising that many Eastern socialites vacationing in Arizona and New Mexico have adopted such an outfit for their personal use . In addition to regional inspiration for clothes the publicity departments of various motion picture companies encourage new and original designs for their actors . Altogether , California is an ideal place for the creation of clothes of many kinds . It would seem that California-made ready-to-wear might sell to De De lohnson gives her own bright-fingered , Cahtornia know-how to Guatamalan hand-woven cotton play clothes . A nice way to look dramatic under the eastern sun , are they not ?  | western stores , but , until 1945 , 85 per cent of the garments pro-. duced in Los Angeles were shipped east . This came about because California firms were willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War II cut off the supply of Parisian designed merchandise , eastern stores were sending sportswear buyers regularly to the California market . Although of growing importance in the production of coats , suits , and men 's leisure wear , it is in the field of women 's sportswear that the California garment industry has made its name . ( The work of Adrian and Irene is discussed earlier in this chapter because their work is of an entirely different character than that of most California firms . William Joyce , whose playshoe has been so successful , is discussed in the chapter on shoes . ) Retail shops such as Gump 's in San Francisco , Bullock 's Wilshire and the 1 . Magnin stores have their own designers whose names are widely publicized . Irene , now with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , was at one time doing exclusive designs for Bullock 's Wilshire . Well-known manufacturers Fred Cole , Cole of California , and the Catalina Knitting Mills headed by Edgar Stewart come at the top of the list of successful California firms . Mabs Barnes , Louella Ballerino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viola Dimmitt , Addie Masters , and Voris are all regarded as designers of importance in this market . Mabs Barnes , or Mabs , as she is known in the trade , got her start in the creation of a tight fitting panty . She was a professional dancer and disliked the binding professional tights . She created a new garment using the lengthwise and crosswise grain of the material to make a close fitting garment that is comfortable . From designing underwear she went to swimming suits which were also brief and comfortable . Louella Ballerino loves exotic coloring ; in recent years she has used native Mexican or Indian designs as inspiration for her clothes . She was one of the first to use hand-blocked designs for dresses and this technique enabled her to achieve effects that are entirely different from those possible with roller printed fabric .  | One of her first successes was a dress printed from an African design . Her previous training includes study at the University of Southern California and with a well-known motion picture studio designer . Irene Bury had the courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of following the rules which require all greige goods to be bleached white before dying , produced a cloth with a new color , quality , and texture . This fabric Miss Bury introduced in her own exclusive colors as Lona Cloth . Her first successful garment was a one-piece corduroy pajama that she sold herself to a Los Angeles store . Marjorie Montgomery does gay play clothes for the firm of Marjory 's Things . Agnes Barrett created the sensational broomstick skirt made by wrapping a wet cotton skirt around a broomstick and tying it securely with string while it dries . This procedure produces an uneven crinkled effect . Such skirts were tremendously popular before wartime restrictions limited the use of cotton cloth . The skirt was sold to customers on the broomstick so it could be washed and " recrinkled . " Voris has perfected the working of fine leather in attractive clothing . There is nothing new about a leather jacket ; such garments have been worn in England for centuries . But Voris developed a new technique of putting the skins together ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made suede garments high fahion . These are only a few of the more than four hundred manufacturers in Los Angeles alone . In 1945 the long-established Swiss silk mill of Swartzenbach-Huber bought a California mill . This purchase leads to the conclusion that still more is being planned to further the designing of distinctive clothes in California . Colleges and universities have special courses and the industry has started a sales promotion scheme to bring California-made merchandise to the attention of customers and retail buyers . By 1945 , many eastern retailers had established shops selling exclusive California-designed merchandise .  | American Apparel Manufacturers Place of the Ready-to-Wear Industry in the National Economy PRODUCTION of wearing apparel is one of the na-THE tion 's major industries , ranking with steel , building , and food production . Besides the manufacture of men 's , women 's , and children 's clothing , the clothing industry produces such articles as foundation garments , work clothes , uniforms , millinery , furs , handbags , shoes , jewelry , scarfs , and handkerchiefs . Many leading designers are also concerned with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the eastern seaboard , but soon other sections became known for special types of merchandise . Rochester , Philadelphia , and Baltimore lead in the production of men 's clothes , Chicago and Kansas City in house dresses and work clothes . With the central Merchandise Mart , Chicago interests are promoting fashion goods , drawing an increasingly large group of buyers and merchandise managers . Boston once led in the production of women 's clothes , but is now noted for skirts and sport dresses . Since 1930 , St. Louis has emerged as a leader in the teen age market . Los Angeles has become a center for sportswear for both men and women . New York the Fashion Center Many factors combine to give New York leadership in the fashion field . Although the annual sales of men 's and women 's ap-  | parel in New York City decreased by $914,429,292 , or about forty per cent , during the twelve years preceding World War I1 , the 1939 fashion industry 's dollar volume was $1,480,499,153 , according to the report prepared in 1943 by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion industry employs 43 per cent of New York City 's wage earners , or 223,156 workers ( 1944 ) , and produces 36 per cent of the city 's manufacturing output . During the years preceding World War II , competition increased from industrial areas in neighboring states . Factories producing goods designed , priced , and marketed in New York City were located in these neighboring centers . New Jersey , Connecticut , Pennsylvania , and Massachusetts , which , in 1927 , had 20.9 per cent of the nation 's wage earners in women 's and children 's wear , climbed to 35.4 per cent in 1939 . While they thus gained 14.5 per cent , New York 's share declined from 54.6 to 41 per cent , a loss of 13.6 per cent of such workers . The report concluded that a second field of competition had resulted from the growth of apparel-manufacturing markets in other sections of the country . In Southern California , for instance , in women 's apparel alone the annual volume was near one hundred million dollars . Also , many large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities . Today Fifth Avenue department stores regularly send buyers to review collections and place orders in St. Louis , the leading junior dress market , in Southern California , for sportswear and higher-priced apparel , and in Kansas City , Chicago , Dallas , Philadelphia , and Boston for other fashions . While statistics thus reveal a decline in the importance of New York City as a fashion center , such factors as the location , nearness of fabric mills , abundance of workers , presence of editors of many national magazines , and the assistance of financiers versed in problems of the industry account for New York 's place as the main source of supply for fashion merchandise . New York City occupies a strategic position in relation to boat  | and plane travel from both England and the Continent . Leading retail store owners , manufacturers , and designers must go through the city on their foreign buying trips . More than one-third of the total population of the United States lives within 350 miles of New York City . This includes , in addition to the cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Virginia , West Virginia , Delaware , Connecticut , New Jersey , Rhode Island , Massachusetts , Vermont , New Hampshire , and Maine . This great market of potential customers affects the large metropolitan retail stores . Manufacturers of fashion merchandise like to sell to stores where an immediate reaction to their new season 's collection can be obtained . In this city , if a manufacturer 's line is slightly " off , " or badly styled , there is sufficient time to design and produce a second collection without the costly loss of a season 's business . All large buying offices have headquarters in New York City . Consequently , when a manufacturer in another center makes desirable goods , he must send salesmen to this center or maintain a showroom here for the convenience of his customers . The fabric mills and their designing departments and showrooms are located near New York City . It is true that many far-sighted selling agents , converters , and fabric companies have established offices in Chicago , Los Angeles , and other markets , but the fact remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the essentials permits a designer to work with the fabric stylist in advance of the season , to talk over desired effects , and to specify new colors . Operators , pressers , and other garment-industry workers prefer to live in the metropolitan area . Work in the garment industries appeals to certain types of people who through family connections have inherited an interest in such work and who apparently prefer it to all others . An attempt by the government a few years ago to locate an apparel factory in Maryland met with little success although homes and gardens were provided for the workers at a low cost . These workers preferred to live in New York because their friends and families are there , and because their churches  | and synagogues , clubs , and food shops catering to their appetites and food preferences arc there . In New York they arc understood and have their niche in the social order , and their unions work for their protection ; employment in other centers appears to them either hazardous or unwise . The fashion magazines and newspapers play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion merchandise . Astute , shrewd , and experienced , the editors who select frocks and other merchandise for photographing are keenly critical and unbiased in their selections . While their reporters cover the entire United States , their representatives are in closest contact with New York designers and manufacturers . Such fashion editors of metropolitan papers as Miss Virginia Pope , of the New York Times , review all the important collections . These reporters personally know many of the social leaders who attend the theater , the supper clubs , and the opera . So , frequently , the name of the designer is mentioned in a news story . Out-of-town fashion and news editors are equally alert and well-informed , but it is impossible for them to maintain close contact with the New York market . In 1943 the New York Dress Institute , by inviting editors and fashion writers from leading cities throughout the country to be their guests at a " National Press Week , " gave wide publicity to the New York creators . Repetitions of this event are presented as part of a program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Detroit became the automobile center because bankers knew the carriage business and the character of the men who wished to embark on the automobile manufacture . New York bankers arc well-informed concerning the requirements of the garment industry . Funds are available for the deserving and the competent . This easy flow of money fosters the setting up of new companies and helps to carry manufacturers over a had season . Advantages of Other Markets Nations that before World War II produced various goods for retail trade are re-establishing contacts with buying offices .  | Factors that seem advantageous to other markets than New York include lower wages , interest in native design , nearness of many stores , availability of exclusive designs , source of raw materials . That fashion has an international scope was called to the attention of the trade when , on August 15 , 1944 , the international buying office of D. Roditi and Sons , New York City , announced that they had completed plans for re-opening their European offices in Paris , Florence , Brussels , Stockholm , and Prague . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , landing on the southern coast . Roditi , with its 40 offices and 60 buying agencies serving a number of leading American department stores , maintained offices in London and Ireland throughout the war . It has representatives in Algiers , Switzerland , Portugal , and Turkey , as well as in all the Central American countries . Ten offices have been established in Latin America ( according to Women 's Wear Daily , August 15 , 1944 ) since the beginning of the European war . These are in Sao Paulo , Montevideo , Buenos Aires , Santiago , Lima , Medellin , Mexico City , Rio de Janeiro , Quito , and Monterrey . Since the re-establishment of these agencies , fashion goods from these cities have increased in volume . Neutral Switzerland , intent on maintaining prestige in the fashion industries , presented its Third Swiss Textile and Related Industries Fair in Zurich in 1944 . Unrestricted by regulations of wartime economy , this fair , called " Color in Fashion , " included designs by creative artists , dress manufacturers , and couturiers , utilizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grieder , Elso Berberes , and Sacha Morgenthaler , designers working in Zurich , were included . Frederick and Nelson , the Seattle retail store , presented a display of Swiss goods early in 1946 . In America the national scope of such manufacturing is steadily expanding . In 1944 , Los Angeles manufacturers prepared a list of objectives as part of a permanent , industry-wide program for the control and healthy development of the apparel industry of California . Among the eleven objectives stated was the formulation of an industry code of practice setting forth minimum standards with regard to styling , originality , quality of workmanship ,  | delivery , and return policies . Boston , Milwaukee , Chicago , St. Louis , Dallas , and Miami , in addition to the California markets , are devising plans to secure a larger percentage of the business in apparel manufacture . Diversified markets provide diversified design . Mexican-made silver , textiles , glassware , pottery , and blouses have a charm and appeal which are distinct from merchandise made in American factories . The scattering of manufacturing centers has aided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Middle and Far West ; it is a costly procedure to visit the New York market several times a season . Many such stores find their needs very well met in markets nearer home , where the buying trip is accomplished in one or two days , instead of the seven or ten days needed for a trip to New York City . Manufacturers outside of New York are frequently able to confine certain styles to one shop , thus providing an opportunity for the shop to advertise and feature exclusive merchandise . New York manufacturers , for the most part , produce on such a large scale that they are obliged to refuse to confine numbers to any one store . In the case of higher-priced coats , suits , dresses , millinery , and other accessories , this is not the case , but this " high style " market makes up only a small percentage of the entire business . The Garment Manufacturer The manufacture of fashion merchandise is a precarious venture . Profits can be tremendous . Two or three men who know the industry can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investments are required , as they are in the manufacture of fabric , shoes , or automobiles . However , losses are frequent . The turnover is urge . One large buying office found that 89 per cent of its dress business was done with firms that had been in business less than two years . Fashion rightness is the keynote of the apparel manufacturer . If his garments " click , " or sell in quantity , he may become rich in  | a short time . The successful manufacturer , however , may lose his production man , his designer , or his leading , salesman , who may decide to go in business for themselves ; many firms are made up of former production heads and designers for other firms .  | This explains why the production is usually handled by a member of the firm , and why many manufacturers are also making the designers partners or , as it is laughingly but truthfully put , " the boss marries the designer to keep her . " From what sources does a garment manufacturer obtain his patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , through drafting patterns , by copying other manufacturers ' styles , and by developing new styles or those reworked from his own previous season 's successes . Maintaining a designing room is a costly practice ; a designer 's salary is high . She must have one or two assistants , a sample room of four , six or eight sample hands , who , as expert tailors , command high wages . The purchase of sample cuts of fabric , sample buttons , and belts , and the cost of re-dyeing sample cuts of material to obtain a new color must all be figured into the cost of the number of models finally accepted for showing in the line . Not every model is shown . Nor is every model that is put in the line and shown to buyers sold or even put into production . One coat manufacturer making misses ' sport coats produces as many as 300 models , from which 75 are selected for final showing . The models sold must take care of the cost of all the others that were discarded . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The production cost of the garments may figure too high for the particular firm . It may be impossible to buy the fabric , the style may already have appeared in a lower-price market , or the head of the firm may think it is not exactly the kind of garment that buyers expect to buy from him . One salesman may not like a dress . If he expresses strong disapproval before it is put in the line , it is certain that he will not sell it with any degree of success . The dress may come in from the contractors or factory unsatisfactory for a number of reasons ? it may be badly pressed , the shoulder pads may be wrong , the skirt may hang badly , the sleeves may not fit correctly . The designer herself may not like the dress when she sees it in its final form . No designing cost is allowed for lower-priced dresses . Patterns  | are obtained from model makers , commercial patterns , or higherpriced garments purchased at retail stores . One good stock pattern becomes the basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The manufacturer may subscribe to a croquis service . ( A croquis is a sketch prepared by an artist or a designer , who may or may not copy styles from retail stores or other manufacturers . ) Before World War II , there were many croquis services from Paris , some of them reputed to be from the great houses , although individual sketches were not identified . Parisian designers used croquis from artists who chose to sell their work in this way . Being obliged to produce large collections , some designers depended on such services for part of their collections . Drafting of patterns is generally employed by the men 's wear industry . Certain tailors , who are also pattern makers , draft patterns . These , carefully worked out with the needed sizes graded , are the manufacturers ' stock-in-trade . Many firms keep them for years and , as the fashion cycle changes and an obsolete style comes in again , these stock patterns are taken out and used again . For instance , the proper construction of a dolman sleeve on a suit requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a comfortable fit that will not bind the arm . A few years ago the dolman sleeve was used in several lines , but the underarm seam ripped when the jacket was worn . Only one or two firms made this suit properly , and those were manufacturers who had been acquainted with this type of sleeve a decade or more earlier . They used as a guide for new patterns their old correctly drafted sleeve patterns . The drafting of patterns is based on mathematical formulae . There are several excellent trade books that give directions for drafting , and students of home economics clothing classes are familiar with this type of pattern-making , since many learn it as part of their training . There is no law in America which prevents manufacturers from copying each other . This is common practice iii the American apparel trade . Not many years ago , manufacturers boasted that  | dresses in their lines were copies of higher-priced garments . Sometimes they would produce the original dresses they had purchased at retail to prove their statement . This practice is a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for it leads to a sameness in the dress and coat market . Consumers are not inspired to buy dresses and coats almost identical with those shown the previous season . The International Ladies Garment Workers Union This is the union to which almost all garment workers belong . Joint contracts are made between the three wholesale dress trade associations and the workers through this union . Dress manufacturers or jobbers making higher-priced dresses work through the Affiliated Dress Association . Dress houses making dresses in the price range of $10.75 to $29.75 belong to the National Dress Association . The Popular Priced Dress Association consists of manufacturers of dress lines below $5.75 cost , with highest production at $4.75 and $2.87L House dress manufacturers have a different union . Coat and suit workers , blouse makers , and children 's wear houses also have separate unions . In 1941 , the ILGWU gained an agreement with the manufacturers for promotion of the dress industry and more efficient management . The New York Dress Institute grew out of agreements with union leaders co-operating with dress manufacturers to promote the welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined by union officials , who determine the " operating " cost on each garment . Manufacturers who employ their own workers or operators in their own factories have what is known as an inside shop . The workers for the typical inside shop include the designer , designer 's assistants , sample hands , models , production man , foreman , piece goods buyer , pattern maker , grader , helper , cutter , sorters , operators , finishers , pressers , inspectors , packers , shipping clerk , sales manager , salesmen , bookkeepers and clerical workers , publicity and advertising men , maids , and janitors . Many firms maintain their entire organization , with show-  | rooms , designing department , cutting , operating , finishing , inspecting , and shipping departments on the premises . Other manufacturers design , cut garments , and send them to contractors for sewing . Such manufacturers are known as jobbers . Contractors employ operators who make the dresses for the jobber . Each contractor has workers trained in certain types of production ; tailored dresses , softer styles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price lines and as to the type of garment they make . As the union controls the number of contractors each may employ , and as each jobber must provide work for his contractors before opening an inside shop , the industry is stabilized , to some extent . Dress manufacturers and jobbers can not change from one price line to another arbitrarily . While many men in the dress industry were previously contractors , the union does not always look with favor on the contractors ' opening their own wholesale houses . Preparing the manufacturer 's lines The buyer 's or visitor 's first contact with " Seventh Avenue " is in the showroom . Usually this is a pleasant , well-decorated , frequently air-conditioned salon , with chairs and tables arranged along one or both sides , and low partitions between the booths for the comfort and privacy of buyers in making their selections . Here the new models are shown by women especially trained in the art of effectively exhibiting garments . The models are usually tall and slim-hipped , trained to walk and turn to emphasize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fits a girl having size sixteen shoulder and size twelve hips . Manufacturers showing junior sizes use junior models . Coat houses making women 's half-size coats use models that are nearer " stock " size . New designs are prepared each season by the wholesaler . These garments make up his line . Some wholesalers prepare four collections yearly and may add supplementary groups from time to time . Others may show only twice yearly . The makers of higher-priced garments have their own designing rooms and a designer 's staff of assistants and sample hands . Makers of less  | expensive garments may adapt their styles from higher-priced garments bought at retail , or may rework the previous season 's best sellers . As the price of the finished garment must allow for a profit , the wholesale dress designer must always think in terms of the cost of production . At the beginning of each season , she reviews the fabric lines that are available in her price range . She selects and buys cuts ? that is , sufficient yardage for a sample dress ? of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sample dress is most important , because sometimes a dress will be ordered by the retail buyers in black when it is shown in a bright color . But the same dress would not be ordered if the buyers saw the sample model in black . The designer 's ability to determine the exact color for each dress is part of her special skill , and is gained by experience . Button makers , belt makers , and embroidery workers are called in . Selections are made from these lines . Most good designers style some of their own belts and other trimmings . This insures an exclusive design for a few weeks . The designer must make dresses that her firm can sell . Therefore , the timing is important . She must know just when to introduce a radical new silhouette or neckline . The head of the firm works out with her the basic plan for the line : so many longsleeved wool dresses , so many velveteens , so many jacket dresses , so many shirtwaist types , so many in softer styling , so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firm must be sure he has styles that will appeal to all his customers . Buyers look for " re-order " numbers or styles that will replace their " runners " from the previous season . New styles seldom become leading selling styles in the same season . Consequently , most dress lines are inclined to be a little conservative . Designers sketch their designs in pencil and an assistant drapes the garment in muslin or cloth on a dressmaker 's figure . Makers of couture clothes drape on the living model and in the same fabric from which the dress is finally cut . This is a costly procedure , but more elegant effects are achieved . Evening gowns and dinner dresses , especially those in printed cloth or brocades , are designed in this way . The designer 's assistant is a person trained to  | work with the designer . She translates into a finished and accurate garment the sketch made by the designer . The designer corrects the seams of this muslin as it is being made . In or near the designer 's room are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown as the " line . " Most firms making expensive clothes have the garment actually fitted to the girl who wears it in the showroom before the buyers . This practice insures the garment 's attractiveness . Buyers usually ask to see the stock model also before placing their orders , for they know this sample model looks much better than the production garments will . While supervising her assistants , fitting garments on which the sample hands are working , working with fabric salesmen and others who supply trimmings , the designer is also creating new styles . The activities , noise , and confusion at a dress house are such that many designers ( 10 their creative sketches at home and work in the shop only on production and with the sample hands . Some new lines are evolved from past successes . Last season 's styles are cut again in a different material with new buttons and a different-looking belt . Good numbers made with short sleeves are shown the next season with long sleeves . The designer is the hub of the wheel . Her taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing history , construction , and consumer buying habits enable her to present new models that will sell at a particular time and at a specific price . Good designers make hundreds of new styles a year . Being the most specialized workers , dress designers are among the highest-paid men and women in America . Duplicating the line The showroom samples make up the line . Salesmen must have duplicates which are made up and tabbed with pin tickets including the style number , size range , and colors , together with swatches of the material . Salesmen receive their lines simultaneously or according to their territory . Salesmen selling in the South , for example , need their lines earlier than those selling in the Middle West .  | The manufacturer of higher-priced dresses What is the difference between the dress that sells for $50.00 retail and the one that sells for $29.50 ? Style , color , timeliness , fabric , and construction are regarded as the reasons for the intangible quality that accounts for a much higher price . Women become tired of their dresses and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a new silhouette , which is for the time being more exclusive than the volume-priced dress . The name of the designer means authenticity ; it is a guarantee of its style-rightness . This newness may be introduced in a different shoulder , neckline , or skirt treatment . The newness may be in the color , which is always a potent appeal . A new or different color in a staple fabric usually commands a higher price in ready-made garments , especially in coats and suits . That the style may be copied later in lower-priced lines does not deter the fashion-minded woman who needs a distinctive new garment for her wardrobe . While the makers of popularpriced garments have made great progress in developing well-fitting patterns , it is a fact that the higher-priced garment does enhance the appearance of the difficult figure . In such clothes the bodice and skirt seams are ingeniously placed and the waistline is more carefully adjusted . The maker of higher-priced garments generally uses better , more costly fabric . His prints are frequently hand-blocked or screen-printed , insuring limited yardage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confined to it for a season or more . In the lower-priced market , many basic constructions are used in different-priced dresses . Fabrics for this market are made by larger mills which produce in quantity . Dress Production The construction of a better dress is another reason for the difference in cost . For instance , an operator on $10.75 wholesale dresses makes 15 to 18 dresses a day . The worker on $29.75 cost  | dresses spends almost a day making a single dress . Before a dress shown in the line to buyers is cut , that is , " put in work , " the orders must accumulate to make a cutting ticket . The number of orders required before the dress is cut depends upon the wholesale cost . Manufacturers of $10.75 dresses require orders for hundreds of dresses to cover the initial cost of making the patterns . Higherpriced garments may be cut when orders for 50 garments or even less have been written . Less expensive garments may be cut in lots of 500 or more . A popular-priced house making sportswear never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advance of the season and have the material on hand before the dresses are exhibited in the showroom . Others operating on a limited capital show a dress and wait for the cutting ticket to come through before buying the cloth . In some cases a new and desirable cloth may be sold out before the manufacturer places his order . That is why buyers see dresses in one cloth and receive stock in something entirely differ , ent . Sometimes it is the substitution of a less expensive material ; other times , the manufacturer has found for the same price a fabric very similar to the original . In either case , it is not the original cloth . In the coat and suit market , the mills withdraw certain numbers because of the cost or the finishing , or just because the cloth does not sell as well as was expected . The fabric buyer must know the market , must be familiar with constructions , colors , prices , and delivery . If the jobber or manufacturer does not have the fabric already bought , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece in the staple colors and a half-piece of the " high " shades . All cloth is examined and measured by the wholesaler , garment manufacturer , or jobber , since converters and mills refuse allowances on imperfect cloth if part of the piece has been cut before the damage is reported . The pattern maker , upon receiving the cutting ticket , makes the pattern for stock . ( The dress shown to the buyers is a model size too narrow in the waist and hips for the average woman . ) The pattern maker is one of the highest-paid workers in the wholesalf. firm . Some pattern makers are so skillful that they can make sale  | able dresses from almost any design . This procedure is an intricate and exact science . Not only must the shape of each individual piece of the pattern be correct , but the pattern must be planned in such a way that the grain or lengthwise run of the cloth will fall correctly . The pattern maker 's assistants make the various size ranges for each model . These " graders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixteen up from the basic fourteen and mark the size twelve down from the fourteen . To insure proper fit for all size ranges , this work must be done exactly . Much of the success of the finished garment depends upon the pattern . The width of the shoulder , the depth of the armscye , the placing and depth of the darts , the length of the waist , back , front , and sides , the fall of the skirt are all factors that go into making the salable garment . The dressmaker , or couturiere , cuts garments one at a time . In the wholesale market , one of the soundest economies is obtained through mass cutting . In the cutting room are long tables 40 or 50 inches wide and from 8 to 20 or more yards long . On these tables the fabric is spread in layers . Lower-priced makers use machines that unroll the cloth . The number of " lays " depends upon the wholesale price of the garments . Better makers may cut only two garments at a time ; others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " lays " are cut as can be run through with the knives . To guide the cutter a " marker " or master pattern is made of the arrangement of all the little pieces of the various size ranges . It is more economical to cut four size ranges at once than to cut only two . A tracing is made of the mark or marker so that , when the style is re-cut , the pattern is already at hand . Great care in placing the pieces of the pattern on the cloth is taken to insure the proper fall of the various pieces of the garment . Stripes and plaids must be arranged in such a way that the dominant motifs match , otherwise the garment will appear crooked . In the houses having an " inside " shop all steps in the making , pressing , and shipping of the garments are ( lone under the direct supervision of a member of the firm . Most of the higher-priced wholesalers operate in this way . In the lower-priced brackets , the  | actual operating is done through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on dresses up to $5.75 wholesale , 35 per cent on those wholesaling from $5.75 to $16.50 and 40 per cent on dresses priced at $16.50 or more . In the inside shop , the various pieces of the pattern are sorted as to color and size . Tied into bundles , these pieces are given to the operators . The shop foreman places the duplicate of the showroom model on a figure and studies how it is made . The exact procedure of sewing the seams together is figured out and the operator stitches the pieces together . Better dresses are basted , that is , temporary stitchings are put in to hold the fullness at the desired place . After shoulder , waist , and skirt seams are stitched , the seams arc given what is called an " underpressing . " The seams are pressed open . Then the garment returns to the draper , who adjusts the skirt and waist on a dummy figure . This is done by matching the center back and center front of the skirt . Cloth stretches when cut , so careless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape before it is stitched . Draping is a slow procedure and must be carefully done . It is always one way to distinguish between a cheaper and a better dress . The hem line is marked on the figure by marking a chalk line around the dress a certain length from the floor . The dress is now returned to the operator for further stitching , and the sleeves are made , pressed , and stitched into the garment . Finally , a complete pressing is done before the dress is finished . Finishing involves all the hand work on a dress : hemming , sewing on snaps , hooks and eyes , or loops , and so forth . Embroidery may be done by hand , but in that case the pieces to be worked are sent out to embroiderers . Pleatings , shirrings , self-covered buttons , and belts are generally sent out to specialists and reassembled on the dress in the factory . In some firms examiners scrutinize every seam inside and out . All loose ends of thread are tied and clipped . Any spots are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be properly aligned . Such details as the shoulder pads are important in the construction of a dress . In better dresses , shoulder pads are shaped to fit  | exactly and produce just the effect desired . They are covered with the dress material . Lower-priced dresses have cheaper shoulder pads , which may lose their shape and fit after a few wearings . From the inspector , the garments go to the shipping department , where , tagged with the size and lot number , they are hung until orders are made up for each customer . Cheaper dresses for the New York stores are delivered by runners and hand trucks or carts containing the dresses hung on hangers . This saves delivery time and the dresses are ready to be hung in the stockroom without being unpacked . In the case of the contractor making the garments for the " jobber , " the shop foreman and the union representative settle the cost of operating . This is based on the amount of stitching and work involved and consideration of the wholesale price of the garment . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorted bundles to his factory , where they are stitched or operated . Only one pressing is given lower-priced dresses . The finished dresses are then returned to the jobber , who marks , sells , and ships them . The manufacture of lower-priced dresses This is the field in which American manufacturers are pre-eminent . Efficiency experts streamline the factories and lighting engineers install modern illumination . Every possible advantage is taken in labor and fabric to provide smart , good-looking dresses at a low cost . The manufacturers in this price group are the largest producers . With their tremendous volume , they are able to obtain a better price in the purchase of material . Thus , in 1944 , $3.98 manufacturers were using the same fabric in the basic construction which the $6.75 manufacturers were using . The lowerpriced maker uses fewer colors and fewer prints . He buys a cloth that has been out a season or two and is already a proved success . The mills turn out such a fabric in quantity , whereas during the previous season it was not too plentiful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The so-called " uptown " converters sell to the higher-priced manufacturers exclusive colors and prints and must charge a higher price than that obtain-  | able from the " downtown " converters , who run roller prints and only staple colors such as blue , red , black , and brown . The maker of more costly dresses must have several different fabrics represented in his line ; the lower-priced maker has only two or three and in fewer colors and a smaller number of prints . He does not show so many styles and is not burdened with the cost of designing . In this market the styles are obtained from the past season 's successes . For example , a dress that " clicks " has a plastron yoke with a ruffle . It is shown the first season in cotton with a white plastron . If it sells well , it is made for the fall in allblack crepe . If it continues to sell , it is again put in work in a printed fabric with a plain-color plastron . The basic pattern is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a different number . Buyers do not expect to find new numbers being produced at wholesale in low-priced garments . The emphasis is on production , not styling or design . Dresses bought at retail are used as samples by some makers . The higher-priced garment is given what is called a " skin it " treatment . This means that , if the sleeves were long , the manufacturer makes them short . Less sweep is used for the skirt . Smaller bows and a narrower belt are used . If the better dress buttons down the front , the cheaper one will be made with fewer buttons or with the skirt stitched up to below the waist . If the better dress has five lace appliques or embroidered motifs , the copy is made with three . Real economies are obtained in production when a dress is being copied in lower-priced materials . The sample dress taken from the higher-priced original is figured for production , shown to buyers , and , if sufficient orders are obtained in a short time , is put " in work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is taken to have all the pieces of the same dress cut from the same piece of rayon crepe . A variation of color so slight it is not apparent in the cloth may spoil the effect of the shoulder of the dress . So the material is placed on the cutting tables with a sheet of paper between each piece marked to indicate the piece number .  | The cost of garments in the lower-price market is distributed approximately one-third for material and trim , one-third for labor , and one-third for overhead and profit . During World War II , the government required manufacturers to submit a cost record of each garment .  | Dresses AMERICAN manufacturers excel in the making of lowpriced ready-to-wear . The economies effected by mass production , efficient plant management , and high-speed machines combine to give American consumers fashion-right garments of durable materials , sized properly to fit all shapes , sizes , and ages of women and children at a low price . European businessmen in 1946 studied American methods and were installing factories based on the same system . While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually with a minimum of five fittings , the American manufacturer makes the ready-to-wear dress worn by all classes . The Sewing Machine Before the invention of the sewing machine credited to Elias Howe in 1846 , all clothes , shoes , hats , and so forth had to be stitched together by hand . This procedure gave an advantage to countries where low wages prevailed . The sewing machine became the basis of factory production . The Civil War gave impetus to the factory system and also provided practical , more accurate statistics on required sizes of men 's clothes . Hand work has always been the keystone of the French Haute Couture ; the sewing machine and mass production , the keystone of the American industry . During the later part of the last century the sewing machine was developed for the shoe industry so another important product was better-made at a lower price than the hand-made product of comparable cost .  | Sewing machine manufacturers make special machines for every branch of the industry . During World War II , several machines were designed to stitch men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , add a lace ruffle , and make a seam at the same operation . Others put on bindings and cording , stitch sleeves in place , stitch and finish the seam at the same time . Electrically operated , the machines are capable of as many as 3,000 stitches a minute . Low-priced dresses are operated or stitched in five minutes ; a worker produces 18 a day . Retail Classifications The retail classification of dresses is made for consumer convenience . Use is the basis of the assortments . Daytime , dressy , sports , evening , and house dresses and wedding gowns are found in large stores . Junior dress departments have been established in many shops catering to the girl or woman who is small in size or youthful in appearance , regardless of age . Women 's dress departments are segregated from the misses ' departments in many retail establishments . The great demand for cotton dresses in 1941 and the continued popularity of this fabric resulted in the enlargement of cotton dress departments , where street dresses and dressy cottons may now be had . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color , fabric , or decoration determines the use of the dress . A fuchsia crepe dress , however simple , would be dressier than the same garment in black . Embroidery , sequins , and appliques of satin or lace make any dress , even a shirtwaist type , dressy in appearance . Sport dresses are usually sold in a sportswear department , but the great popularity of the shirtwaist dress , the most favored sports dress , has created a demand for this style in all departments except that for very young girls . An evening dress may have the same fabric and lines as a shirtwaist dress ; an afternoon frock decorated with sequins or other elaborate trimming may be a shirtwaist type .  | Rich materials , such as velvet , satin , lace , brocade , and lame , suggest formality and are generally used for afternoon or evening dresses . Evening dresses are significant in the fashion world because new ideas are generally adopted first for evening wear . If the new fashion is accepted , day dresses , beach wear , and even underwear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , the robe de style , with its full skirt , low-cut , tight-fitting bodice , and short , puffed sleeves , was a favorite dress for several seasons . Then the dirndl or peasant frock in similar style was introduced in cotton , as a sports , house , and even street dress for very young girls . The draped evening dress , with embroidery and sequins , was accepted before draping was introduced for daytime . In 1941 , the low-necked short evening dress was introduced . By 1943 , a great demand developed for sunback cotton beach dresses and day dresses in other materials with short jackets for street wear . To forecast future housecoat styles or petticoats , designers watch evening clothes . It may be that a woman will wear for evening a more daring , extreme , or unusual gown than she will adopt for daytime . Evening gowns are more dramatic and may have greater variety in color , combination of material , and silhouette . Chanel 's creation in 1938 of gypsy dance dresses with lingerie blouses and skirts of plaid or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1939 of blouses for both day and evening . Gowns for formal evening wear are generally more elegant , with low decolletage and bold colors , rich , dark tones , pastels , or white . Dinner dresses are more simple in line , with sleeves or a separate jacket , and not so extreme at the neckline . Dance frocks are generally full-skirted , as this dress in motion is prettier than a slender or tight-fitting skirt . Bridal gowns are similar to evening dresses in style , with white satin , lace , and crepe the favored materials . The neckline is usually modestly cut and seldom extremely low or revealing . Many fashions in wedding dresses are traditional copies of period gowns  | and in other ways depart from the current fashion influence . Separate departments are maintained in most shops for the showing of bridal dresses and other trousseau items . Maternity dresses World events influence fashion , including dress styles . The increase in the rate of marriages and children born to young wives before and during World War II resulted in a new sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dirndl style , long a favorite with juniors , was devised in numerous ways to accommodate the blessed event , since olderlooking maternity dresses were not popular with these young mothers-to-be . Panels , tucks , pleats , and wrap-around closings were introduced in the dress and , strangely enough , one wraparound maternity dress with a drop shoulder and surplice neckline became a favorite dress in the regular misses ' and women 's departments . The answer to this demand for youthful maternity clothes is evidence that consumers as well as designers are responsible for new fashions . Price Lines The American clothing manufacturer gears his production to price line and type . The unions have developed strict regulations concerning dress manufacturing , and jobbers and manufacturers are not permitted to change their price lines without the approval of the executives of the union to which the individual manufacturer 's employees belong . During war years , government regulations controlled the industry . Until the beginning of World War II , street dresses were made to sell wholesale for $2.87L $3.75 , $4.75 , $5.75 , $6.75 , $8.75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually show garments in several price brackets , depending on the fabric and cost of construction . A manufacturer known for $22.75 dresses generally shows wool crepe fall and winter dresses at this price , and includes a group of $18.75 in rayon crepe for spring and sum-  | nicr . Jacket dresses would be about $29.75 , with a few at $.39.75 . Likewise , at the $12.75 wholesale price , manufacturers may include a few $8.75 numbers for summer and jacket dresses or embroidered dresses for $22.75 or even $29.75 . Higher-priced houses start their lines at about $55 wholesale . There is further specialization with certain price ranges . For example , one $6.75 manufacturer may make only tailored dresses , another afternoon dresses , and still another only junior dresses . House dresses are generally of cotton or rayon and priced by the dozen , as $48.00 , $30.00 , $22.00 , $15.00 , $12.00 , $8.75 , and so forth . Not all dresses are marked up to retail at the same price . A $10.75 dress may sell for $16.75 at one shop , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusively for that city , for $18.75 or even higher . Fifth Avenue shops in New York are sometimes able to obtain a higher mark-up than most stores in other districts , because Fifth Avenue is in the center of a higherincome consumer group , and stores there are able to sell newer styles in greater quantity than stores elsewhere . Dress Sides Sizes of shoes , hosiery , hats , and gloves are standardized , but no exact standardization of sizes is followed by the dress manufacturer . Dresses are made in women's-36 , 38 , 40 , 42 ; misses ' - 12 , 14 , 16 , 18 , and 20 ; junior-9 , 11 , 13 , 15 , 17 ; and half-size ranges-141 , 161 , or 241 , 261,281 . The styling of women 's dresses is more conservative than that of misses ' . Most new fashions are presented in misses ' sizes . Couture creators do not like to see their extreme new fashions worn by large women . For that reason many of the better manufacturers cut only a few styles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a type . The junior has a high bust , small waistline , and larger hipline than the miss . She likes full-skirted frocks , tight bodices , and high necklines that show her lithe figure to best advantage . The shirtwaist type dress is not  | her most flattering , but because of the practicality of this style consumer demands require junior manufacturers to include it in their lines . Government statistics compiled by the Bureau of Home Economics in the Department of Agriculture reveal that the average Table  | American woman is five feet three inches tall and weighs 133 pounds . She has a 39 " hipline . To fit this size person , several manufacturers are including a new size range , shorter than a regulation 16 in both waist and skirt .  | Dress Styles A study of costume history will show certain silhouettes used again and again . Styles or models are popular , or in fashion , then become obsolete and disappear , and many years later are reintroduced . The classic Greek dress was reintroduced in the nineteenth century as the Empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , named for the girls drawn by the artist Charles Dana Gibson , was revived in 1939 . The sarong of South Sea natives , popularized by Dorothy Lamour of the movies , was a definite fashion influence from 1937 to 1943 . In 1944 Norman Norell , an American designer of higher-priced clothes , turned to the fashions of 1926 and used the Parisian silhouette of that period as his inspiration . With the numerous neckline , sleeve , skirt , and bodice treatments , the possibilities of different styles are endless . The oriental kimono had not been seen as a dress style for many decades , but in 1942 Claire McCardell , sportswear designer of New York , made a kimono-sleeve cotton dress , promoted as the " Pop-over , " that was most successful . This dress was a cotton denim wrap-around , devised for the woman suddenly faced with the necessity of being her own housemaid , but it was worn by many women and girls for general use . The success of this dress led to the demand for other kimono-sleeve dresses . Dress Silhouettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apron-like skirt worn by the Egyptians ; the draped Grecian dress ; the sari of the Indian women ; the kimono of the Orientals ; the parco and sarong worn by both men and women in the South Sea islands ; the monastic silhouette of heavy , dark woolen worn by Figure  | the monks ; the Middle Ages ( moyen age ) dress , with the " waistline " around the hips in a style that is now called long-torso ( similar to the middy silhouette ) . The Renaissance dress , of rich , heavy fabric with wide skirt and sleeves , influenced the market in 1933 . The Empire style , derived from the Greek , reappeared in 1938 . The robe a la Francaise , tight-bodiced , bouffant-skirted silk gown of the French court and the English court dress , always rich , and in white or pastel fabrics , accompanied by ostrich plumes worn in the hair were important evening dress styles before World War II . The Spanish dress , full-skirted with panniers and shawl , influenced the Spanish couturier Balenciaga . Other French styles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling from the shoulders at the back and illustrated in many French pictures of this period ; the houppelande , button-down-the-front , close-fitting , coat-like dress ; and Vionnet 's bias dresses . Dress silhouettes that have been important in the wholesale market since World War I include the basic , shirtwaist , two-piece , dirndl , ballet or bouffant , Empire , draped , pinafore , princess , wrap-around , Chinese , kimono , jumper , sheath , long-torso , redingote , peplum , tunic , Gibson Girl , corselet , Watteau , bias , monastic , and smock . Devc. ' obm nt : + of Basic Designs Three early costumes worn by the Egyptians and Greeks were the draped garment ; the apron , and the sheath . A study of costume history shows how each has been developed . Each of these styles may be made from a rectangular piece of cloth : it can be worn around the body like an Indian blanket , wrapped like a sarong or the East Indian sari , fastened at the shoulder like a chiton , or worn as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sides seamed . ' Footnote  | The kimono is another garment devised from a simple rectangle and worn by men , women , and children in the Orient . The early apron developed from the loin cloth is really not a dress , since it was only a covering for the waist and hips . However , this simple wrap-around effect has been further developed as both a coat and a dress style in various ages . The draped silhouette generally shows folds of material loosely hung from the shoulders , usually held in place by a belt or girdle . Alix of Paris revived this style in her famous jersey dresses late in the 1930 's . The sheath , even in very early ages , was apparently seamed and shaped . That early Egyptians knew the use of thread is shown at the Metropolitan Museum , in New York City , where seamed linen headdresses and other garments are displayed . The tunic style is achieved when a rectangular piece of cloth has an opening cut in it for the head . The tunic may also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short . The short tunic is usually held in place by a belt . The houppelande of the fifteenth century is the forerunner of our button-down-the-front dress . The original was made with a fitted waist , long sleeves and skirt , and was worn by both men and women for almost two hundred years in France , according to Paul Rodier in his book , The Romance of French Weaving . " The shirtwaist dress introduced in 1926 is a development of this basic style . The present-day shirtwaist dress is characterized by a wellfitted skirt with fullness released by either gores or kick pleats . A center-front closing , with or without a simple collar , long or short sleeves , and a shoulder yoke are other features of the houppelande . The basque or moyen age silhouette has a low waistline and no center-front closing . Long-torso styles developed from this costume . When the skirt is full and the waistline normal , the silhouette is called the robe de style or bouffant dress . This style , similar to the robe a la Franfaise of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteen-twenties by Madame Lanvin of Paris , who always showed this " picture " type evening gown . The dirndl or folk dress is similar in style , but usually made in cotton , with low round or square neckline , short full sleeves , and a straight-hanging , full-gathered skirt . The Empire silhouette , inspired by the Greek , has a high waistline , low round or square neckline , short full sleeves , and a skirt falling straight in front but full in back . White cotton or silk was the material used at that period . Many of the paintings of the Empire period show a short jacket or shawl worn with the Empire dress . The lavish , full-skirted velvet gown of the Renaissance period was rich and made with a fabric such as silk or fine cotton in a light color showing at the neckline . The Gibson Girl silhouette . Charles Dana Gibson , American artist , gained fame and wealth from his drawings of the " Gibson Girl . " The girl who later became his wife was his favorite model . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Langhorn ( Lady Astor ) . Gibson drew pictures of her and her friends . The clothes worn then , in the late nineties , were from Parisian designs . But because of the popularity of these pictures , the silhouette came to be known as the " Gibson Girl " silhouette . The dress has a bellshaped skirt fitting tight at the hips , close bodice , and leg-of-mutton sleeve ? full at the upper arm but tight from the elbow to the wrist . A jabot of lace or ruffles was worn at the high neckline . The same silhouette is seen in the dresses , coats , and suits of that period . Madeleine Vionnet of Paris created the bias dress , which was the first original dress style to emerge in modern fashion history . Because this dress was made without a center-front closing , and was without plackets , it was the most important silhouette change since the houppelande and the Empire dress . So distinctive was the work of this great couturiere that designers describe the style as " a Vionnet neckline " or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cowl neckline , a softly draped arrangement  | that can he worn either high or low and that is equally flattering for all women , both slender and heavy . The fitted back , with scams from the armscye to the side back , distinguishes the redingote dress , taken from the English riding coat . Single-breasted and open all the way down the front from collar to hem , it is made with the regulation suit-style sleeve . The redingote style has also become popular as a simple , plain coat to be worn over a print , harmonizing with or matching the dress . The chemise-type dress was first created by Rose Bertin , dressmaker to Marie Antoinette , who fled to England at the time of the French Revolution . Because the dress was introduced there , it was called robe a l'Anglaise . This is a simple , plain-color dress with a sash at the waistline and worn with a fichu collar . The bolero is a short jacket , made with a curved line from center front to the side at the waist , ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bodice is identified by that feature . The kimono dress is a wrap-around style . There is no armscye seam or shoulder seam . The true kimono is geometric , cut from one length of fabric with only two side seams . It is secured at the waist by a sash or girdle . The jumper dress is made without sleeves , or so devised that it can be worn with or without a blouse or sweater . Various skirt treatments are used in this style . The basic dress , promoted by B. Altman and Company , of New York , has been featured as a suitable dress to wear with accessories of different character , flowers , a necklace , pin , or clip . The dress with new variations introduced each season is generally without front closing , softly styled to be flattering to most women . Bodice or Waist , Neck , Sleeve , and Skirt Treatment There are many excellent books on dressmaking on the market which anyone interested in further details of dress construction will find absorbing . In Color and Design in Apparel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silhouettes and bodice , neck , sleeve , and skirt treatments . Of the historic costume books , The Mode in Costume ' presents the history of costumes in France and England . Variations in the basic body lines of dresses are obtained by various combinations of sleeve , neckline , waist , and skirt treatments . Countless possibilities come to the mind of the creative designer as she reviews the many variations open to her . The successful creative designer is able to present just the right combination of fabric , color , trim , skirt , waist , neckline , and sleeve innovations at the right time to meet the demands of both retail buyers and consumers . Introducing a design too early is as fatal as presenting it too late , when others have already introduced a similar idea . A good design always looks simple . That is because the designer is an artist and adept at balancing all the various elements of a garment . In addition , he has a timing ability , and knows how to introduce a new silhouette in such a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist type is the button-down-the-front style , which may be closely fitted with gores or darts . A tight-fitting waist with or without center-front closing , as usually worn , is called a basque , long-torso , or sheath . Any fullness , either in the sleeve , in the neckline , or at the waist , is referred to as draped . This drapery may have many forms , such as a twist of the fabric at the neckline in front , or swathed treatment of gathered sections at the hip line , or more elaborate manipulation of the fabric in the skirt below the waistline but part of the waist . The kimono waist is loose-fitting , without shoulder or armseye seams . The tunic waist is an overblouse or short coat . Separate tunics are generally knee length and worn with trousers or narrow skirt . Clare Potter , American designer , featured a tunic pajama for dinner and resort wear in one season 's showings . She made this in many combinations of fabric , no doubt inspired by Persian tunics , Footnote  | which were closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer 's coat shows the influence of this style . A bias waist may be tight-fitting or loose . Women 's dresses with the front cut bias , the back straight , and the skirt gored are frequently made of worsted crepe . Sport dresses of this style may be made in plaid or striped fabric , cut on a bias to achieve interesting designs at the front or sides . Necklines The neckline of a dress is a most important feature . If this is flattering , a woman will buy the dress . But if the neckline is difficult to wear , even though the body lines of the dress may be pleasing , the fabric , color , and the price right , the dress will not sell in volume . Designers say that the most difficult task in creating is devising a new neckline . The neckline without collar may be high , low , round , square , V- or U-shaped , or heart-shaped . The collarless and reverless neckline has been introduced in both suits , dresses , and coats . The cardigan neckline is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bateau neckline ( from the French word for boat ) is wide across the throat , boat-shaped . It is high in front . The crew neckline found in sweaters and certain jersey frocks is straight and high around the throat . Collars Collars are of various shapes : round , square , peak , or notch , and made to be worn high or low . They may end in a bow or capelike circular section . A short cape that does not open in front is called a bertha . A Chinese collar is a narrow stand-up collar ; a shirt collar is taken from a man 's shirt . For women , shirts are made without the neckband . The riding shirt is an exception , but the buttons close opposite to those on a man 's shirt . A shawl collar comes over the shoulders . The Peter Pan , club , and Johnny collars are all small , round collars closing in front . A ruff is a full , stand-up ruffle . Some collars are actually ruffles : when wide , they give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end in sleeves . The convertible collar is a shirt collar that can be worn open or closed . A waist front or yoke double and closing on a slanting line , is called a surplice neckline . A jabot is a frill at the neckline . A fichu is a triangular scarf tied around the shoulders . Sleeves Most regulation dress sleeves used by the quantity dress manufacturers are cut in one piece on the straight of the fabric , that is , the grain of the cloth falls from the top of the shoulder . Or the same sleeve pattern may be cut on the bias and thus be made tightfitting yet comfortable . Higher-priced dresses are made with a two-piece sleeve , or with a long dart from the elbow to the wrist . Sleeves are always made one for the right arm and one for the left arm ; one is the reverse of the other . A double sleeve may have a long , tight sleeve and an oversleeve , bell shaped or like an open bishop sleeve . A bell-shaped sleeve is narrow at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so named from ecclesiastical vestments , is wide and full , sometimes pleated when of thin material . A wrist band secures the fabric at the cuff in the bishop sleeve . Short sleeves may be straight , circular , puffed , draped , or ruffled . A cape sleeve combines the features of a cape and a sleeve . The dolman sleeve is wide at the top ; its opening extends to the waist . A kimono sleeve has no shoulder or armseye seam . The leg-of-mutton sleeve is full at the upper arm and tight from elbow to wrist . The envelope sleeve is constructed of folds of cloth and is generally wide and full . A melon sleeve is round with lengthwise or crosswise sections introducing fullness . It may be of any length . The raglan sleeve is more frequently used in coats than in dresses . It extends to the neckline in front and back , although modifications of this style are made which look like the raglan sleeve only in the front or the back . Knitted-fabric sleeves set in a cloth garment are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of various shapes , the shirt cuff , the French cuff ( which is turn-back ) , and wide or narrow . Cuffs may be of the same material as the sleeve or of a contrasting fabric or color . Skirts A skirt may be described by the way the fabric is treated , such as tucked , shirred or pleated , gored , straight , draped , circular , bouffant , bias , ruffled , made in tiers , with a bustle , or with panniers . A gore is a section of a skirt . While a skirt can be made with only one piece of material wrapped around the figure , this is not especially flattering or comfortable for general wear . Most skirts are made of two or more pieces or gores . The two-gore skirt may have the seams either at the back and front , or at the two sides . A three-gore skirt may have one gore at the front and two at the back . Four , five , six , eight , and more gores are arranged with the seams in different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give fullness to the bottom of the skirt . Straight skirts are full or tight-fitting , two-piece skirts are made with or without flare . Draped skirts permit great variety of treatment , such as the harem skirt , the sarong or sari skirt , and draped panels used with gores . In 1944 the draped skirt became popular in all price lines . The circular skirt is popular for evening and skating dresses . Many variations are possible , such as a circle of cloth , or a semicircle , or a fuller skirt made with wide godets or panels set in the circle . Sometimes a circular front is used in a skirt with a straight back . Or a circular section is set on a yoke , giving the skirt shape and an attractive line at the hips . Most circular skirts made in the dress industry are carefully worked out with fitted hip lines and ingenious shapings . They may look very simple , but that simplicity is achieved by good cutting . A bouffant skirt is full . This fullness can be either circular or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circular front and straight full back . This style is used in evening dresses with a tight bodice . A bias skirt may be tight or full . A tight bias is not very suc-  | Figure  | cessful for women 's dresses , as the fabric tends to puff out in back and make a " seat . " A bias-front skirt with a gored back makes a successful skirt . ( Bias slips are successful because they fit the hips comfortably and without plackets . ) The pleated skirt may be pleated all around , as is the Scottish kilt , or it may be a straight skirt of gores with set-in or kick pleats . There are many kinds of pleats , but the most common is the knife pleat . The box pleat is two knife pleats in reverse ; besides these there are accordion pleats , cartridge , sunburst , and simulated pleats . A ruffled skirt may be a plain skirt with ruffles stitched on crosswise , lengthwise in panels , in circles , or in other motifs . Two , three , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain skirt make a flounced skirt . The latter term is also used to refer to a skirt with a wide ruffle used around the bottom . The same description fits a tiered skirt . The set-on tiers or ruffles may be used all around , or for only front , back , or sides . A bustle is a puff of fabric at the back of the dress . Panniers are side puffs . Skirt types not widely used during the present decade include the peg top , which is wide at the hips and tight at the bottom ; the hobble skirt , which is similar or which is a straight , tight , tubular skirt ; the minaret , which is made up of wide tiers ; and the harem skirt , made with a narrow underskirt stitched to a wide overskirt . The harem skirt is achieved with the fabric folded at the ankles as oriental trousers are made . A few hobble and harem skirts appeared in 1944 collections in New York , but their obvious impracticability did not make them popular . The Dressmaker Dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after World War I were in an economic position entirely different from that of our American dressmakers . The members of the Haute Couture were , for the most part , designers and heads of their own important business organizations , honored by the government , and respected as leaders not only in business but also in  | social life . The small local dressmaker in the United States was formerly just a degree above a servant ; she was more of a seamstress than a dressmaker . But if she were clever , she could copy , originate , and make variations . The most skillful dressmakers gradually acquired shops , and from some of these simple beginnings great dress shops have grown . America has had a few great dressmakers , belonging to the era before the dress industry developed . In many cities good dress and accessory shops still bear the name of some woman who started her career simply as a seamstress or home dressmaker . These women were as important in their day , and in their communities , as the Paris dressmakers were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes on models , and the customers order from this showing . Each gown is available only in a few colors , and there is not always a wide variety of fabrics to be had . If a customer does not like the dresses shown , she does not buy , since the couturiers seldom make a special model for one customer , except in rare instances , when higher prices are charged . Few American dressmakers show an entire collection . Our own present-day " name " or Couture dressmakers prefer to cater to a small clientele of women who are familiar with the type of costume the dressmaker produces . The construction and fit account for the high price of the custom-made dress . A dummy or dressmaker 's form is made for each regular customer . A tight-fitting eight-gore muslin bodice , fitted inside out so that it will be fairly accurate is made to duplicate the customer 's figure . Sleeve forms are made separately . After the bodice is fitted , stitched , and refitted , it is moulded over a form with padding worked into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewed onto the form and the waist , front , back , and necklines are marked . On this figure new dress designs are created and dresses in construction are fitted . It is to the dressmaker what a custom-made last is to the shoemaker ; in reality it is a " stand-in " for the customer . Women prominent in social or business life find numerous dressmaker 's fittings too tiresome and time-consuming . Nor do most of them  | have time to attend the fashion shows either in the shops or staged by the shops in smart hotels and restaurants . Having shopped for a dress , and having seen the models offered by their favorite dressmaker-shop , they order the gown , and with two or three fittings it can be made ready . Patterns The dressmakers Dressmakers are not very articulate in answer to the question , " Where do you get your patterns ? " Actually those patterns are the most precious professional equipment , and the dressmaker does not always know just where she got them , as most of them have been evolved over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources of patterns used by dressmakers : old garments , newly drafted patterns , draped models , and commercial patterns . From plain , basic dress patterns each dressmaker works out her own designs as to neckline , sleeve , waist , and skirt treatment . She has numerous patterns and uses different ones from time to time . The high-class dressmaker in her own shop charges about one hundred dollars and up for a dress , whether for day or evening wear . She generally has a supply of fabrics , some of which may have been sold exclusively to her , or sold only to her in her city or part of the country . Retail stores allow the small dressmakers a discount on their purchases ; the big dressmakers , of course , buy direct from manufacturers . Cutting and fitting Once the pattern or model , color , and fabric are decided upon by the dressmaker and the customer , the customer 's measurements are taken for length and any other measurements that may be necessary for the particular style in question . A pattern is then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ width , skirt length and width , and sleeve length and width at the upper arm ,  | lower arm , and wrist , unless the dressmaker already has such a pattern for this customer . Dressmaker dresses and those made by Couture manufacturers are cut one at a time , with scissors , and the notches that indicate how certain sections are to fit together are marked with chalk or basting thread . The center front and center back of both waist and skirt are marked to help in keeping the garment exactly straight . After cutting , the sections of the front are carefully pinned and basted together , then the back sections and the skirt . The handling of fabric requires care , as two skirt lengths of cloth may be basted in such a way that one stretches several inches . Adjusting fullness correctly is one of the dressmaker 's tricks . The seams in a bodice should fall over the largest part of the bust in front , and at the back the seams should follow lines that connect with the front seams but which give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stitching are always done from the neckline to the shoulder , from the underarm to the waist , and from the top of the skirt to the bottom . Likewise the pressing , which is so important in dressmaking , follows these same lines . For the first fitting , the sleeve is put together with basting , and two rows of fine basting are made around the top of the sleeve to adjust the fullness as the sleeve is basted in . When the garment is first fitted on the dummy or the individual , the following points are checked : the neckline , shoulder seam , place of side front seam or darts , place of back seam or darts , width and length of bodice , waist , and hip , and bottom width of the skirt . Correct fitting is tedious , slow , and painstaking . After the first fitting , seams are ripped out and any changes made , basted , and pressed preparatory to a second fitting . For this fitting the sleeves should be stitched and the sleeve , now the correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in one seam necessitates a change in the other , the second fitting may show that still further alteration must be made . A slight correction at the shoulder , at the bust line , or across the back may be required . The skirt width , properly fitted at the waist and hip , should be  | ready ; the placket is basted , not stitched in . After the second fitting , when the correct changes have been made , the skirt and waist are pinned and basted together . The care with which this is accomplished has a great deal to do with the appearance of the dress . The dress should be neither too tight nor too loose ; seams should be straight ; the waistline should be at the correct point even if the skirt is joined to the bodice below the waist . The waistline is the narrowest part of the torso . A third , fourth , or fifth fitting may be necessary for some customers to get the exact hem line , as the bottom can not be finished until the skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stitched . Fastenings Four kinds of placket or fasteners are regularly used : buttons , hooks and eyes , snaps , and mechanical or slide fasteners . Novelty fasteners are introduced from time to time and several styles of cloth plackets are available . Buttons may be of natural substances , such as stones , pearl , shell , bone , tortoise , coral , jet , or wood , or of synthetic materials such as Catalin , Unite , Bakelite , celluloid , or combinations of these with metal , wood , or other substances . Covered buttons are made with either wood or metal forms . Those made of wood do not rust , while those of metal rust if the garment is washed . Covered buttons are made in many shapes , such as flat , semi-round , halfround , and acorn , either fiat or with rims . The sizes of buttons range from eight " line , " slightly smaller than i inch in diameter , to 100-line , 2 inches in diameter . The unit of measure is the line ? 40 to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Likewise , snap fasteners and hooks and eyes are made in a range of sizes . The best are rust-proof . The dressmaker sews the buttons on with heavier thread than that used for stitching seams . Buttonholes are handmade or bound . Hooks and eyes and snaps are properly fastened on with buttonhole stitch . Tightly fitted  | dresses are best secured by small hooks and eyes , or good snaps set close together . Mechanical fasteners are excellent for skirts , but too heavy for thin material such as chiffon and organdy , although small colored plastic and metal slide fasteners for use with lightweight fabrics have been perfected . Besides attending to the details of finish and trimming , the dressmaker must decide on what kind of seam to use in making a dress . The plain seam is the most common . Others include : the French seam , used on straight seams on sheer fabric ; the fell , such as is used in men 's shirts ; the corded or piped seam , having a band of bias material either folded plain or with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is used for edges . Other interesting seams include the slot seam , which may have a contrasting section of material underneath ; it looks like two narrow pleats facing each other . A shaped slot seam is a nice detail used by skilled workers . Entredeux is a narrow strip of lace or embroidery used between the pieces being joined , as in fine cotton dresses and blouses . Fagoting is a type of embroidery . The seam edges may be finished with pinking , binding , overcasting , or stitching . After the final fitting of a dress , when all bastings have been removed and buttons and other fasteners properly adjusted , small straps are attached to the shoulder seams to hold the brassiere and slip shoulder straps in place . A dressmaker dress , being entirely made by one or two workers , has seams , edges , and fasteners finished by hand . Shoulder pads may be all handmade and covered with the same fabric as the dress . The dress manufacturer uses stock-size , ready-made pads . Embroidery , beading , sequins , and pleatings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ techniques and designs are not easily copied by the manufacturers , and therefore the dress has individuality . While dressmakers may be excellent designers in their own field , few of them are equipped o design for the wholesale market , where cost of fabric and production are major considerations . However , many times dress designs used by exclusive dressmakers do get into the wholesale market , either through pirating or sale by the designer to a manufacturer .  | Dress Fabrics Dress fabrics enumerated here include those made of cotton , silk , linen , rayon , and Aralac , nylon , and other synthetic fibers . Wool and worsted goods are listed under " Glossary of Coating and Suiting Fabrics , " page 326 . Facts the buyer wants to know The purchase of fabrics for clothing ? in yard goods and accessories ? and of decorating materials and household furnishings is a never-ending problem for the consumer . Because ready-to-wear clothes have a fashion appeal , the average customer is apt to ignore fabric quality . While there are many fine textile manufacturing companies and converters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in consumer satisfaction , the imitation , copying , and making of substandard fabrics is a practice centuries old . Will it wear ? This is a question that must be answered with consideration of the kind of fabric , quality , and use . In 1944 , because of the shortage of rayon fabrics for civilian use , many manufacturers used cloth that had been made according to military requirements but was rejected as seconds . Each division of the garment trade has fabrics especially designed and produced for it ? underwear , corsets , drapery and upholstery , millinery , materials for dresses , sportswear , coats , suits , wlsh dresses , and so forth . The price of a piece of material does not necessarily give an indication of how long it will wear . A fine linen handkerchief is more beautiful and costly than a coarse , heavy cotton one , but it will not wear as well as the cotton . The sheerest silk stockings are made for beauty ? not service . Sheer cotton-and-rayon dress goods have a definite place for certain kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary requirement . A properly selected fabric will give reasonable consumer service . The retail buyer must be sure fabrics are suitable . The fabric should not stretch , sag , shrink , split , fade , or wrinkle excessively if  | the rules for its care are followed . Not all dress fabrics that look washable are colorfast . Fabric editors are critical about color fastness of wash fabrics about which they write . Some spun rayon textiles are made and finished to be washable , while others identical in appearance are sold with a label recommending drycleaning . New finishes have been perfected that prevent fabrics from water-spotting : other finishes are fire-retardant , moth-repellent , and so forth . Federal Trade Commission rulings Federal Trade Commission rulings require the retail buyer to be informed on the content of textile fibers . All fabrics containing rayon must be so identified . When rayon is used with other fibers , the percentage used must be stated . The terms satin , crepe , and taffeta used without a qualifying adjective indicate an all-silk fabric . Wool fabrics must be labeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool , re-processed or re-used wool . Re-processed wool is that which has fallen out of the flow of fibers in manufacture , or scraps of fabrics remaining when garments are cut , while re-used wool has been previously made up into cloth or clothing and then garnetted and re-used . Where combinations are used , the fiber content and percentages must be stated . Factors that determine quality The two principal processes used for the manufacture of cloth are weaving and knitting . Braiding , as straws are braided , is used for belts and in the millinery industry . Narrow tapes and shoelaces are also braided . Crocheting is a hand process somewhat like knitting , except that it is done with a crochet hook . Cellophane is rolled out , as are sheet rubber and other plastic sheetings , and is cut as is cloth , or variously used . The fibers used for textile fabrics include the natural vegetable fibers , cotton , linen , kapok , jute , and ramie ; the animal fibers used are wool , silk , vicuna , llama , camel hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as ostrich , in combinations with wool and other fibers . The synthetic fibers include yarns made by the viscose , cellulose  | acetate , and cuprammonium rayon processes , nylon , Aralac , Vinyon , and synthetic fibers made from a soybean base . Glass fibers are being developed for draperies and upholstery because , in addition to their attractive appearance , they are fireproof . Throughout history certain fabrics have been developed and perfected in certain countries , for example , silks from Lyons , France , fine-quality worsted and cottons from England , tweed from the islands north of England , crepe from Canton , damask from Damascus , silk from China , madras and calico from India , and Shetland from the Shetland Islands . There are many grades or qualities of fibers . " Egyptian " cotton is the longest and finest and is the top quality of European cotton , while Sea Island cotton is the finest American grade . Cotton fabrics are made either carded or combed and can be recognized by the firmness of weave and the weight . Combed yarns are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ginghams , and many other standard cotton fabrics are made either way , combed or carded . Obviously , a combed gingham of good coloring would be more expensive than a carded gingham because of the increased cost of producing combed yarns . Linen fibers are made from flax , their distinguishing characteristics being determined by country of origin as well as by the fineness of spinning . Irish , Belgian , and Russian linens have been imported in the past . Oregon linen is now produced in America . Long linen fibers are called line while short ones are called tow . Thus , the finest qualities of the fabric are made of line while less expensive ones are made of tow . The best silk for dress goods is reeled from the silk cocoon . Short fibers spun from the silk from pierced cocoons is called spun silk . Rayon , nylon , Aralac , and other synthetic fibers are used as filament yarn or spun yarn . The term " spun yarn " is a misnomer , as filament rayon yarn is spun or solidified as it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is meant filament rayon yarn that has been cut in various lengths and re-spun into a yarn having different characteristics from the filament yarn fibers . Spun  | rayon fabrics are made to resemble linen , wool , cotton , or silk . The filament yarn is as long as desired ; it may be thousands of yards long . Each yarn is composed of many filaments , as , 100-denier 24-filament yarn . The denier is the size . " Fifty denier " is fine , while 100 , 150 , and 200 deniers arc coarser . One hundred and 150 denier are used for popular-priced rayon crepes . The count of fabric indicates the number of lengthwise and filling or weftwise yarns used to the square inch . Count is indicated with the warp number always stated first , as 144 by 72 , which is the standard construction for cotton broadcloth . A standard percale has the count of " 80 square , " or 80 by 80 . The fineness of knitted goods is estimated by gauge , that is , the number of needles used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " stockings are coarser than 52 gauge . The weight of cotton cloth is stated by the number of yards per pound . Muslin , for example , is 4.4 . Woolens and worsteds are graded according to the number of ounces per lineal yard , as , 12. ounce , 141-ounce , and so forth . Weave There are six basic weaves : the plain , twill or satin ( re-arranged or irregular twill ) , dobby , Jacquard , leno , and pile . Most dress goods is plain or twill weave . Differences in the size , character and content , and color of the yarn produce numerous variations . Plain woven cotton goods is known as print cloth . It is converted , that is , it is bleached , dyed , and finished , into many products , such as percale , shirting , sheeting , chintz , shade cloth , oil cloth , and so forth . Twill and satin weaves include satins , sateen , serge , flannel , gabardine , and so forth . The " dobby " is a loom attachment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diamond motif in the cloth . Dobby motifs are always small , while Jacquard motifs are larger and generally pictorial , rather than geometric , in character . Madras shirting is made on a dobby loom ; damask , brocades , and matelasse are woven on a Jacquard loom . The leno and marquisette weave is used for glass curtains , sheer dress goods , coarse sacking , dishcloths , and other loose-  | weave textiles . In this weave the warp yarns are twisted around the filling , producing a sheer cloth that will not slip , that is , the warp yarns will not become displaced if the cloth is pulled between the thumb and fingers . Pile fabrics include velvets , hollowcut velveteen , velours , terry cloth , and rugs . Many variations of these few basic weaves are possible . When the filling is heavier than the warp yarn , a broadcloth or cotton poplin is produced . Poplin is the term used in the market for English broadcloth , although poplin was originally a silk-andwool cloth . A broadcloth should have twice as many warp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 72 . By " standard construction " is meant constructions that are commonly made by American mills . Designing a new cloth involves using a different kind of yarn , and many mills are not equipped to change the spinning to produce different-size yarns . A novelty irregularfilling yarn produces a shantung effect that can be recognized by crosswise slubs . Originally , a silk cloth this texture was made in both rayon and cotton constructions . The cheapest-quality coarse cotton goods used for wearing apparel is osnaburg , made from low-grade cotton with foreign matter such as stems and leaves left in ; the finest-quality is organdy . The strongest as to weight is airplane cloth . Balloon cloth , tightly woven of fine yarns , was made in quantity for the armed services , but several hundred thousands of yards were released for civilian use in the summer of 1944 . It was used for dresses , but is too tightly woven for a satisfactory dress fabric and , although thin , it is rather hot . True crepes are woven of tightly twisted yarns , both warp-wise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the term crepe indicates a silk fabric . Seersucker is a cotton crepe produced by the use of two warp beams with the yarns held at unequal tensions , making alternate plain and crinkled stripes lengthwise . Most seersuckers are yarn-dyed ; that is , the warp is white and one color such as blue or brown is used with it . A crinkled effect similar to seersucker is obtained by treating  | cotton fabric with a caustic soda , producing a plisse . A blister effect is made like an allover crinkle , with or without a definite pattern . This treatment is used on cloth of various weights : heavyweight plisse is used for housecoats , while fine lawns or organdies so treated are for evening and afternoon dresses . The term cloque or cloky refers to a similar finish on sheer lawn or organdy . It resembles in texture the matelasse fabrics . Voile is a crepe with a high twist . The best qualities are made with two-ply yarn . Simulated or mock crepes are made with regular-twist yarn and are known as mommie crepe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as the finish on a French crepe which is lost in washing . Corded cotton fabrics include dimity , pajama checks , corded chambrays , and other novelties . This cord effect is produced by having several warp yarns woven together . Pajama checks are made with both warp and filling yarns woven in this manner . Twill or satin weaves are made with the warp yarns covering an even or uneven number of filling yarns to make a stronger or more lustrous fabric . Cotton gabardine , sateen , and linings are made in this way . Rayon satins , because of the perfection , strength , and sheen of the yarn , have been most successful for evening dresses . Lighter weights are used for undergarments . In 1943 heavy rayon satins were promoted for raincoats , following the perfecting of rayon " tackle twill , " a cloth made especially for football players ' pants . Yarn-dyed fabrics are those made from yarns dyed before the fabric is woven . " Stock-dyed " means that the fibers are dyed before the yarn is spun . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to refer to an intermediate process in the manufacture of yarn . When hosiery-yarn is dyed before knitting , it is called ingrain . Many woolen and worsted fabrics are yarn- or stockdyed . A gingham is yarn-dyed and woven with motifs that include stripes , checks , and plaids . A chambray has colored warp and white filling yarns . " End-and-end " is a cloth with alternating white and colored yarns . Sharkskin is made in this manner ,  | with a small , almost invisible check . Stripes are woven from colored warps with a solid-color filling . When corded yarns are used in making chambray , it is called a corded chambray . The most important dress fabrics made with the pile weave are velvets , velveteen , and corduroy . A velvet with a long pile of wool or mohair is called a velour . Velvets all used to be made with silk warp , filling and pile . In the museums are many rare examples of velvet brocades , with floral motifs in pile weave on a satin ground . The introduction of rayon led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pile and a silk or cotton back . Chiffon velvet is a thin , short-pile velvet . Panne velvet , popular with milliners , is one in which the pile is pressed flat . Lyons-type velvet is made with taffeta back and a close , stiff pile that originally was all silk . This velvet , although soft , literally stands alone . Lame velvet is made with a metal or simulated metal thread in a gold , silver , or bronze effect . Real gold and silver threads were woven into ancient ecclesiastical and royal vestments , but today such materials are made only for exhibition purposes . Faconne velvet is made with a burning-out process , by which part of the pile is removed with chemicals that dissolve the pile without affecting the back . The cloth is woven plain and then treated with chemicals to alter the character and to produce what looks like a chiffon with velvet motifs . Knit goods For many years , knitted garments were confined to sportswear , underwear , and gloves . Then knitted acetate rayon jersey , introduced from France as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knitted cloth . The producers of wool knit fabrics also made cloth suitable for afternoon and dressy dresses which in no sense of the word could be called sports clothes . Knitted fabrics have many advantages over woven cloth . For the same weight and with the identical yarns , such cloth is warmer and cheaper to produce . It does not wrinkle and it is absorbent ? qualities that make it ideal for bathing suits , underwear , and cold-weather clothes .  | The chief objections to it are that it runs and stretches . These faults are being overcome with the perfection of new stitches . The hand-knitted garment is generally full-fashioned , that is , shape is given to the garment by adding or subtracting stitches at various points in the pattern . Sometimes lengths of hand-knit cloth are cut and sewn as woven cloth . This is not a usual practice , however , except with hand knitters , who use set-in knitted sleeves cut to shape to make a smooth shoulder . Machine-knit cloth is identified by the kind of yarn , kind of machine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth of two-ply yarn is called lisle . A fine worsted knit is a jersey . The term cardigan refers to a warm , closely knit , long-sleeved jacket , and also to the kind of stitch used . This stitch does not run . Circular knitting is used for both dress fabric and stockings . The cloth is made in a tube form , the process resembling handknitting such as is used for a sock . Milanese is a kind of knit showing a series of diagonal lines . It was first made in silk for underwear , gloves , and hosiery . It does not stretch as much as circular-knit cloth , and it will not run excessively . Flat-knitted goods is knitted flat on a special machine . Tricot is also made on a special machine . Most tricots are made of rayon yarn . Tricotknit fabrics will not run . Standard qualities include the one-bar and the two-bar tricots , referring to the weight , that is , whether one or two yarns are used to produce the cloth . Many underwear companies and knit goods houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stitches are novelty stitches used from time to time . Glossary of Dress Fabrics ACELE See Brand and Trade Names . ACETATE RAYON Cellulose acetate rayon known by the manufacturers ' names , as Acele , Celanese , Seraceta , and so on . Knitted fabrics , rayon satins , rayon taffetas , suitings , sportswear fabrics , laces , and sheer voiles and ninons are a few of the fabrics successfully made of this yarn .  | AIRPLANE CLOTH A fabric made for airplane use having the best strength-weight ratio possible in cotton cloth . Made from combed ply yarns , mercerized . A standard count is 80 by 84 . Balloon cloth is similar but lighter in weight and has a higher count . ALENcON Lace , needle-point , hand- and machine-made , generally in floral motifs with heavy yarn or cordonnet outlining the motif . Used in edging for underwear , blouses , and the like . ALLOVER The dispersement of a design , as in embroidery , lace , or printed fabric , having the motif distributed over the entire surface , in contrast to a border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American alpaca sheep ; fabrics , mostly coatings and suitings , made from such fibers .

ANGLETERRE Pillow lace from Brussels made for the English trade . Design motifs include geometric , floral , and ornithological patterns . ANGORA Fiber from the angora goat is the mohair of commerce . It is distinguished from sheep 's wool in that it can not be felted but must be combined with other fibers in knitting and weaving . The term also refers to angora rabbit hair used in combinations with wool for dress and coating fabrics . APRON CHECKS Gingham in two colors , such as blue and white , used for uniforms , aprons , and so forth , generally heavier than other ginghams . ARALAC See Trade Names .

BALBRIGGAN Fine lightweight knitted cotton yarn used for unbleached hosiery first made in Balbriggan , Ireland . BALLOON FABRIC Closely woven , single-yarn , plain-weave cotton cloth having a count of 92 by 108 to 116 by 128 . This cloth is too tightly woven to be altogether satisfactory as a dress fabric . BARATHEA A rich , silk , rayon , or wool warp-face fabric with a broken allover pattern somewhat similar to a broken rep . It is used for men 's ties , blouses , and suitings .

BATIK A fabric hand-dyed with vegetable dyestuffs in the Dutch East Indies by native women ( before World War 11 ) ; also , the method by which the color is applied . Wax is used on the cloth to prevent penetration of the dyestuff . The dye bath breaks the wax and penetrates in fine spider-web effect . After each dye process , the material is dried and a second coating of wax is applied , followed by another dye bath of another color . Although true batik is hand-done , mechanical methods have been perfected to simulate the distinctive effect of batik fabric .  | BATISTE Mercerized , lightweight , soft-finished fabric used for blouses , neckwear , infants ' wear , and so forth . The count is 80 by 88 to 96 by 120 . The cloth is heavier than lawn . In the corset trade , batiste is a strong , plain-woven , single- or ply-yarn cloth heavier than but similar to poplin or broadcloth , with greater tensile strength in the width than in the warp .

BENGALINE A fabric similar in character to faille or taffeta , having a heavy , cordlike filling that gives a width-wise rib effect . Silk and wool , rayon and cotton , are frequent combinations used . A like construction in cotton would be called a rep . BINCI-IE A hand- or machine-made bobbin lace edging with a characteristic cane seat or eight-pointed star motif in the ground . No cordonnet is used , and the edge is generally made with a picot and loop . Geometric motifs are used exclusively . BIRDSEYE A cloth with a small woven geometric dot resembling a bird 's eye .

According to a nationwide survey , American women buy only one coat every two years . As a result , fashion change is slow , and a new trend or model evolves from the acceptance of another . Successful models in coats may sell for eight to ten years in the higher-priced groups . Such a coat was Gabrielle Chanel 's famous reefer , featured by a well-known Fifth Avenue retailer and advertised and promoted during the 1930 's . In 1946 the same coat was still selling with only slight change . Helen Cookman , of New York City , designer of custom-made coats and suits , has been making fitted chesterfields in tweed for her private customers for many years . The box coat , also borrowed from the men 's wear department , is a best seller in the women 's department , too . As sales of the classic fitted chesterfield increased , the boxy or unfitted chesterfield , with the velvet collar and the fly front the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are popular for a season , there is also a consumer demand for coats made to wear over them ; the boxy or swagger coat , for example , is preferred to the fitted or bloused coat . When coats are dressy , dresses reflect this trend . One fashion influences an-  | other . The long popularity of the shirtwaist-type dress followed the success of the casual , fitted reefer coat . In France , clients of name designers buy and wear new coats with accessories ? hat , shoes , bag , and gloves ? that are designed to complete the costume . In America , women buy a coat to fit in with the rest of the wardrobe , to wear over several dresses even when one particular dress is bought to wear with the coat . As the purchase of a coat is a major investment for the average woman , she is inclined to favor conservative rather than ultra or high-fashion models . What is a coat ? The dictionary defines a coat as an outer garment made by a tailor . To understand tailoring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear manufacturers and that used by the dressmakers or the dress operators . Coats were originally designed for men , so a strictly tailored coat is a feminine version of a man 's coat , in lighter-weight fabric , sized for a woman 's figure , and with lighter-weight canvas and padding . The tailor shapes or moulds the fabric with frequent hand pressings ; steam , the hot iron , and pressure . Good underpressing ? the pressing done before the garment is finished ? is an important part of good tailoring . The tailor works with wool or fabric constructions based on wool patterns in combination with other fibers , such as wool-and-rayon or wool-and-Aralac . The fact that wool shrinks enables the tailor to build into the garment a shape that is permanent . The dressmaker used darts , tucks , pleats , ruffles , shirrings , peplums , flounces , and other dressmaking devices to give the dress or coat shape and character . Silk , cotton , sheer wool , and rayon fabrics comprise a dressmaker 's medium . In France , when famous name designers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to do man-tailored garments . Most workers in the Couture were women ; tailoring is always done by men . A classic tailored coat or suit follows the rigid specifications of a man 's suit or coat . Single- or double-breasted , with peak or notch  | Figure  | Figure  | lapel , it closes with one , two , three , five , or more buttons . A softly tailored suit or coat is a compromise , with darts , tucks , or other soft or dressmaker devices . A tailored suit or coat is designed for a man 's figure . Girls , tall and slender women , or women with good figures and carriage generally look well in the classic suit . Most women , however , need the softer coat or suit to disguise bad posture and a figure that is not ideal . Coat styles An understanding of the various basic body lines used in garments will be gained from a study of the construction of historic types of clothes . The first outer garment worn by man was the skin of an animal thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric made without seams or shaping was the coat of ancient people living in warm countries around the Mediterranean . Persian paintings show shaped and fitted garments made of cloth with hand-stitched seams . Because man 's activities of hunting , exploration , travel , and war necessitated protection from the elements , the coat with shoulders and sleeves shaped to permit the use of the arms and a skirt sufficiently wide to permit the wearer to walk comfortably was evolved . The picturesque poncho worn by men in the Argentine , Mexico , and the Southwest of the United States consists of a rectangular piece of heavy woolen fabric with a slash in the center for the head . Promoted as a utility raincoat for rumble-seat riding , this ingenious garment has been borrowed in North America for wear as a sports garment . The American Indian devised another method of protecting his body ; he wore a length of fabric wrapped around his body . The Roman toga , also wrapped and draped , and held in place by the arms , was a garment for the wealthy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conquer Europe found a folded blanket worn over the shoulders a necessity for warmth in the mountains and during the snowy winters . The modern stole , which somewhat resembles the Roman stole , is a long , narrow length of cloth or fur worn around the neck in the same manner .  | It is not a coat , of course , but a decorative collar . It is also associated with the dress of the clergy . Another simple rectangular length of fabric , worn with a girdle or sash , is the kimono , worn in Japan by both men and women . In the Near East , especially Arabia and Persia , and in North Africa , a similar garment with or without sleeves is worn without the sash by men . In the fifteenth century , the use of a circular section of fabric cut with a center opening so that it slipped on over the head permitted the making of graceful garments . Early pictures show priests and dignitaries of the church in garments of this type . The monk 's robe of heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garments , such as the Arab 's burnoose and the Roman 's toga , were worn in warm countries , since the movement of the fabric , generally light-colored , made it comfortable in the heat . In cold countries , the shaped and fitted garment was developed . Necessity and available material dictated the styles . The Russians , the Scandinavians of the Far North , and the Eskimos wear the parka , a fur-lined , hooded garment without front opening except for the face . The garment may be entirely of fur worn with the fur side against the body . It is worn with fur-lined or fur pants for greater warmth . For protection against tropical rains , a rain cape of rush , woven together as a basket is woven , is made in Java , the East Indies , and other tropical countries . Modern coats derive their lines from these many primitive garments . They may be considered in two groups : the boxy , straight-hanging garment , and the fitted or shaped coat . Capes may also follow these basic body lines . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , single- or double-breasted . A single-breasted coat or jacket is one that fastens in the center front , while a double-breasted garment is cut in such a way that one side extends across the other . The functional buttons , those actually used to fasten the coat , are matched on the top , or closing , side of the coat with an identical row for decoration . As doublebreasted coats are not particularly flattering for the adult woman 's  | figure , designers have developed many ways of simulating this effect without the bulkiness generally associated with this model . When a straight coat is made with additional back or front fullness , it is called a swagger coat . If made with a collar that buttons at the throat , this coat is usually identified as a Balmacaan , although detail of cut also influences the Balmacaan . This type of throat fastening is also called the military collar . A stole-like collar , that may or may not fasten in front , is used on a woman 's Tuxedo coat . In men 's clothes , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so named , it is said , because it was first worn in America by a prominent man from Tuxedo Park . A coat held in place without buttons is called a wrap-around ; in recent years , the long Tuxedo collar line on a loose swagger coat has given such a coat the name Tuxedo coat . The fitted coat is made from pieces of fabric cut and shaped to conform to the figure . The shape of a fitted coat is obtained with the use of gores and shaped sections . One of the prettiest fitted coats is the princess coat . In New York 's Metropolitan Museum are several elegant silk princess coats worn by men during the time of Louis XIV . The gores in these coats extend from the shoulder to the hem . Children 's , misses ' and junior coats are frequently made with many gores in this manner . This is an attractive garment for the feminine figure , as it has a flattering flared skirt . The reefer coat is a modified princess with a less well-defined waist and a narrower skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloused section at the waist ; on these the skirt is shaped and closely fitted , while fullness is adjusted above the waist . Collars The usual collar treatment on women 's coats from 1930 to 1946 was borrowed from men 's wear , the three most common styles being the peak or notched lapel , the military collar , and adaptations of it . All these collars are used on either single or doublebreasted box or fitted models . The notched collar looks as if a notch or V of fabric has been cut out of the collar edge . The  | peak lapel is made in such a way that the facing of the coat extends beyond the collar . This gives an illusion of width to the shoulders and is a flattering style for most women 's figures . The trench coat is made double-breasted , with a deep collar shaped to fit the shoulders . A club collar is a small , circular collar , and is also called a Johnny collar . A straight stand-up collar is called a Chinese collar . The neckline made collarless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collars include the surplice , square , cape , and shawl collars , all similar to dress collars . Shoulder treatment sleeves Another important feature of a well-designed coat is the shoulder . Coat designers speak of the balance of a coat as a quality which determines proper fit . " Balance " in a coat refers to the way the coat falls or swings , which depends upon the shoulder treatment . A good coat hugs the shoulders and feels comfortable to the wearer . The shoulder line , in turn , is determined by the sleeve and the kinds of pads used . It is said that in Paris the designers employed by a name fashion house would give other designers any basic body pattern except one piece , which was never loaned or given away but was locked up in the safe each night . This was the sleeve pattern . The importance of sleeves is seen in the fact that at the Museum of Costume Art in New York an entire course of lessons was given in sleeve making , and that many of the students attending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat sleeve is the so-called " regulation " sleeve attached to the body of the coat at the normal shoulder line . This sleeve is usually made in two pieces , instead of in a single piece as is a dress sleeve . This regulation sleeve may be varied by the kind of shoulder pad or by the width of the shoulder . Adrian , who established his own shop in Hollywood , introduced a seven-inch shoulder for women 's suits and coats that met with much success in 1943 . A wide shoulder line with a fitted hip creates the illusion of height and slenderness . A raglan sleeve is one set into the neckline . Many modifications are made , one being a raglan sleeve in front with a set-in  | sleeve in back . This is an excellent sleeve in a coat to be worn over a suit , as it is loose-fitting . The raglan sleeve is a characteristic of the Balmacaan coat . While without pads this line is not especially flattering to a woman 's figure , in 1943 coat designers introduced a rounded raglan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rulings , restrictions introduced during the war to conserve fabric , prohibited the use of the dolman , bishop , and wide bell sleeve . The dolman sleeve was used in the dolman wrap pictured so often in Godey 's Lady 's Book and worn during the 1840 's and , from time to time , until the end of the century . The dolman sleeve is similar to the kimono . It extends from the waistline to the elbow or wrist . Once introduced in dresses during the 1940 's , the style did not become successful , since there were on the market no coats under which to wear the wide-sleeved dress . The original dolman garment of the nineteenth century was worn over dresses with large sleeves . The bishop sleeve is taken from ecclesiastical vestments . It was originally made in thin white fabric cut wide and secured by a narrow band of ribbon , with the material of the sleeve released into a ruffle around the hand . Although this sleeve has been most successful in sheer dresses , Madeleine Vionnet introduced in a fur coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bell sleeve suggests the shape of a bell ; it has a fitted shoulder and wide bottom with or without a cuff . The leg-of-mutton sleeve , so named because of its resemblance to the cut of meat , was used with the floor-length bell-shaped skirt during the latter part of the last century . It was made with fullness above the elbow , extending to a widely gathered and puffed shoulder . It is still occasionally seen in sheer-fabric dinner dresses . French couturiers devised many other interesting sleeves , frequently introduced first in evening coats or jackets . Madame Lanvin created the envelope sleeve in which the fabric was arranged in folds . Several designers used the melon sleeve , made with circular sections of fabric adding width either above or below the elbow .  | Cuffs Cuff treatments for coats are similar to those used in dresses . It is interesting to observe that when collars are elaborate , cuffs are not used to any extent , but when collars are not used , cuffs appear and are of more importance on the garment . Basic coat styles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styles ; however , many new silhouettes are first introduced as evening or dress coats and later interpreted in daytime coat styles . Chanel , associated with the creation of the princess and reefer coat , used a single idea in coats , suits , and dresses . In 1943 , Claire McCardell showed a white poplin raincoat at the New York Times Fashion Show . Later a similar garment was sold as a beach coat . In 1944 the same style was developed in a wrap-around dress . In 1940 four basic styles dominated the American coat market : the reefer or princess coat , the Tuxedo , the box coat , and the bloused and fitted coat . The balmacaan was a popular misses ' utility coat made as a reversible raincoat , of tweed on one side and cotton gabardine on the other . Conservation of fabric during the war period saw fashion magazines suggesting one coat for both day and evening wear . Vogue in 1942 advocated the black chesterfield for town and evening wear . The shorter coat in 36-inch and 33-inch lengths and hip length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for linings led to the creation of heavier-weight fabrics , such as meltons and chinchillas , that would eliminate interlining and provide a warmer utility coat . By 1944 the leading styles in America were the box coat , chesterfield , Tuxedo , reefer or princess , officer 's coat , tunic coat , wrap around , polo coat , and bloused coat . Fur-lined coats were made in all styles at this time , and of many furs . As a dressy town coat , a black satin wrap-around coat was introduced . The influence of men 's coat styles was evident . p 300 Coat Styles BALMACAAN A loose , flaring overcoat or topcoat with raglan sleeves , usually of a rough woolen fabric , worn by men and women . The name comes from Balmacaan , an estate near Inverness , Scotland . Buttoning to the throat in front , the coat has a separate military or Prussian stand-up collar which has a buttonhole and a button-link for closing .

It is double-breasted , has set-in sleeves , a stitched belt , and special shoulder pieces . These shoulder pieces offer additional protection against rain , since the lap buttons under the collar . They are not " gun pads , " though that is the popular belief . Actually , the original trench coat had only one shoulder piece , on the right shoulder , where the trench coat buttoned over . But another on the left shoulder was added for symmetry . These trim , practical coats were  | taken up in a big way by American college boys in the twenties and have remained ever since as a classic raincoat favorite with men .

" Zip " is an abbreviation of Zipper . The custom-made tailored coat or suit It has been pointed out that much of the prestige of French Couture was due to the fact that the garments of these specialized designers were custom-made . While there are many successful custom tailors and dressmakers in America , most apparel here is ready-made in stock sizes sold by shops and large stores . American women like to see just what they are buying . Moreover , many are impatient and do not like to wait the two or three weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its tiresome fittings . But the man or woman who has worn good custom-made coats or suits seldom is entirely satisfied with stock ready-made garments . However , in America the cost of labor  | has increased the cost of custom-made garments , and the wholesale coat and suit designers have created so many new and interesting styles that custom-made business is diminishing . Many stores have a service that permits the customer to select the color , fabric , and style . The garment is then made to the manufacturer 's stock sizes , possibly with slight alterations in the pattern made at the customer 's suggestions . A large part of the success of a custom-made garment , whether American-made or bought at a Paris fashion house , is determined by the selection of the style which is correct for the customer , in the best color , and the most desirable fabric . A custom tailor generally shows comparatively few models . He usually has very definite ideas about the kind of style he will make for women of various figure types . He is well aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His clientele is small , and he secures new customers from among the friends or acquaintances of his old customers . The appearance of his customers must speak for his good taste and workmanship . In the purchase of ready-to-wear , an ill-advised woman may purchase a garment that is an unhappy choice in color , fabric , or style . True , salesgirls in the better retail stores try to guide the customer , but still some women insist on buying garments that make them look ridiculous . The stout woman in a too-tight suit , a short , fat woman in a red fleece coat , and a small woman in a large plaid coat of heavy cloth are a few examples of incorrect selection . The custom tailor helps his customers avoid such mistakes . When buying a custom-made garment , one may choose a fabric that is exclusive in texture , color , or pattern . Important ready-towear manufacturers also are able to secure certain fabrics exclusively because of their volume of business in higher-priced clothes . Houses such as Bergdorf Goodman and Hattie Carnegie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new color , texture , or silhouette in their custom-made collections , made of fabrics woven especially for them .  | The important thing about custom-made garments is the fact that the customer selects fabric , color , and model . The garment is made to the customer 's exact measurements . Several fittings are made if necessary . An individual pattern is made for each customer . Sometimes a canvas or muslin pattern is made and fitted before the garment is cut . This practice is common in the fur industry . Hand-tailored garments are cut one at a time , and , while machine stitching is used for seams , much of the stitching , as in shaping lapels and collars , is done by hand . Having a special pattern may disguise bad posture or a poor figure . Or an illusion of greater height may be achieved . Shoulders may be made to appear broader and hips narrower by means of artful patterns . In tailoring , the shape of the garment is built into the cloth with tape stitched to the shoulder , armseye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later fastened to the garment . Before the war , linen was used for this inner body . Sometimes horsehair , called hymo or silesia , is used . The inner body is cut , stitched , and pressed into shape . The tape stitched to the fabric edge prevents the armhole from stretching . Fullness across the back is eased into the seam . The coat fabric is held in three-eighths of an inch along the back of the armscye . Bias tape is used along the front of the armscye . Good tailoring shapes the material without the use of darts or tucks . Frequent pressing steams out the fullness . In a tailored garment the underarm seam is stitched after the pockets are made . Then the shoulder edge , armseye , and back shoulder edge are taped . The canvas front is made and attached with hand felling . Then the shoulder seam is made . At the first fitting , the sleeve is usually basted in , since it is impossible to determine correct skirt length without the sleeve . The length of a garment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the skirt and by the shoulder and collar treatment . Fitting coats and suits . In preparing a coat for fitting , the crosswise grain and the lines down the center front and back are marked with a thread or chalk . The shoulder , underarm , and  | sleeve seams arc basted together with the notches matching . A basting thread is run around the neck and fastened so that the neckline will not stretch . The following points are checked as a coat is fitted : 1 . The fullness . It must be full enough to allow room inside for the lining , but it should not be loose and baggy . 2 . Width across the shoulders . Once coats were fitted a little narrower across the shoulders to keep the figure from appearing broad . Today coat shoulders are padded to give width and reduce the apparent width of hips . 3 . The shoulder seam . Instead of running straight , as in a dress , the shoulder seam starts slightly in front of the highest point at the neck and slopes toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The depth of the armscye should be greater than in a dress , because the sleeve must be large enough to be worn comfortably over a blouse or dress sleeve . Seldom are dresses popular if they can not be worn under whatever is the current good style of coat . Dolman sleeves and bustles were not successfully revived in dresses in 1943 and 1944 because there were no coats designed to wear with them , and because they spoiled the appearance of the coats women were wearing then . 5 . Darts . The darts run usually into the neckline rather than into the shoulder seam . This makes it possible to cover them with the lapel facing . 6 . The grain . The crosswise grain or weave must run parallel to the floor . If it drops toward the underarm seams , it is corrected by lifting on the shoulder or by easing more fullness into the neck . 7 . The fullness at the neck . This may be disposed of by small radiating tucks which are decorative . When these are not desirable , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease and shrink some of the fullness in . Further alteration may raise or lower the hem , the shoulder seam , the jacket length , front edge , the neckline , and the sleeve width or length . Skirts are fitted for both standing and sitting positions , as a satisfactory skirt must look well at all times whether  | the wearer is walking , sitting or standing . Exotic designs worn by a model may show a skirt too tight for walking ; but the woman who buys a custom-made garment , from this model or another , generally demands sufficient modification in the design to give her reasonable comfort and ease . The collar is one of the most difficult parts of a tailored garment to make . The linen used for the foundation is stretched and shaped to follow the curve of the neck . The lapel edges and collar edges are taped before stitching to produce a sharp , clean edge . In men 's wear , the undercollar is faced down by hand . In the women 's wear industry , most women object to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collar is stitched first on the wrong side , then pressed , turned , basted , and again pressed . Linings and buttons may be of the same quality as used by higher-priced manufacturers . Custom-made pads for shoulders add to the appearance of the garment . Some tailors make a pad for the back of a woman 's skirt to provide a straight back line . The skirt , through artful placing of seams , pockets , and yokes , and through skillful use of the grain of the fabric , generally makes a woman 's figure look more slender and graceful . Tailored skirts should never be worn without adequate and properly boned foundation garments under them . In the skirt , a minimum of four gores is used by custom tailors , as two side seams and at least one seam front and back are necessary to achieve correct shape and hang . The six-gore skirt has been most popular , because it is flattering to most figures and to all sizes . The most pleasing proportions of the waist , hip , length , and width @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirts are made with the waistline too large . Alteration to correct this fault involves removing the waistband and placket and ripping the seams . For a perfect fit , an alteration of one inch should be distributed among four seams . However , most alteration rooms make such a change with only two seams . If one seam only is altered , the skirt is crooked , because the center front and the center back of the skirt do not come in the center front and center back of the figure . The skirt should hang straight in back from the largest part of the  | hips . The skirt is fitted from the hips up and then from the hips down , since the grain of the material must run parallel to the floor . Manufacture of coats and suits The basic processes used for the manufacture of all cut and sewn clothing are similar . Coats , however , require more care and more operations than do dresses or ready-to-wear for women . By cut and sewn is meant that the article is made from a woven or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stitched together . Other methods of fashioning garments include knitting and crocheting . Occasionally , felt is used for a coat or jacket , but it is not a common material in the industry . Most wearing apparel today is cut and sewn . Knitted as well as woven material is used , but in the coat market knitted fabric is treated or handled in the same way as a woven cloth . There is nothing standardized about the garments produced by the coat and suit industry , where hand work still persists to a rernarkable degree . Skill in the workers ' fingers is a very important consideration . At every stage in the manufacturing process . there is handling . And , aside from materials , it is in handling that we find the key to the distinction between price ranges . What is handling ? The term is more inclusive than hand work . It includes such intangible elements as the degree of care and accuracy put into a garment . The more handling in the garment , the higher the retail price . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the machine can compete with human hands with regard to quality , although , of course , in the lower-price-range garments , quantity production has been achieved . The men 's clothing industry , which is less subject to style and seasonal fluctuations , utilizes somewhat more mechanical power and has a greater sub-division of labor ; therefore , men 's wear factories are generally larger and employ more workers per shop . The best way to understand the importance of handling in the production of a woman 's coat is to follow a coat through the factory . The first step in the process by which a garment is made is  | to decide upon the style . This may occur in one of several ways : a given style may be designed on the premises ; it may be purchased from a firm specializing in the making of models ; it may be imported ; it may be copied from a more expensive garment ; or it may be developed from the firm 's own line of the previous season . Once the model is selected , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvas ) or from previously selected material in accordance with the model . This model is studied , a cost estimate is made , and it is shown to selected buyers before it is put " in the line . " Thereafter , the pattern maker cuts paper patterns for each part of the garment . His assistant or the pattern grader grades them into the various sizes to be made . Estimating the amount of material . Most wool coat and dress materials are woven to finish 54 inches wide . This is an advantage , because the garment is then cut with less waste of fabric than when cut from narrower cloth . Two lengths of 54-inch material are required for the average coat of almost any style . The back is cut from one width and the two fronts from another width . Enough material is left on the sides to cut both the sleeves , lapel facing , collars , cuffs , and other small pieces . Narrow , close-fitting coats or small sizes are cut from one coat length plus a sleeve length , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the material for cutting . Most coat materials are made of wool or worsted that is apt to shrink when the wearer has the garment cleaned unless they are sponged before being manufactured . Reputable coat manufacturers sponge all woolen fabrics before cutting unless they are sponged by the fabric manufacturer , in order to insure better fit after cleaning . This is done by dipping a long strip of unbleached muslin , or a sheet , in water , placing it over the material , and rolling the two together . The materials are allowed to stand for several hours until the wool material has absorbed the moisture evenly . Then the cloth is  | pressed , with a warm iron , with the damp cloth laid over it on the wrong side . Another method of sponging involves wetting the fabric completely , then drying and pressing it . The fabric selected for a particular style is next laid out on long tables in as many layers as are required for the number of garments to be produced , but limited , of course , by the capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eight-yard cutting table , sizes 12 , 14 , 16 , and 18 are cut at once with 60 layers of cloth , producing 240 coats . ) But before the pattern is put on the material , the direction of the nap must be determined . In the finished garment the nap must lay , or be cut in , the same direction for the front , back , and sleeves . Coat materials are heavier to cut than other fabrics . For that reason , fairly sharp scissors are needed . Dull scissors pull the edges of the material and make it ravel . Electrically operated cutters are used by volume manufacturers . Stripes and plaids must be cut in such a way that the pattern matches at sleeve head and for the center hack seam . In higher-priced garments , the pattern in the cloth is sometimes worked into pleasing detail in the garment . The lining for the coat is cut in it is narrower and comes only as far to the front as it is necessary to meet the facing . Across the back it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-quarters of an inch deep in the center back . This fold prevents the lining seams from breaking , as lining materials have less " give " than woolens . It is usually cut about one inch shorter in length ; the coat edge is turned up around the lower edge to prevent the lining from showing . Operating . After the cutting is done , " bundles " are assembled , into which are placed the sections of the coat including the lining , percaline , and tape . These are sent to operators who work on electric sewing machines . These machines have various attachments to take care of different kinds of stitching , and are adjustable to various thicknesses of cloth . The function of the machine  | operator is to sew the various parts of each garment and join them together . One operator works on one color , sewing all sleeves , then all side seams . In the lower-price-range garments , the operator sews the parts of the garment by joining them together . He then passes this body to the finisher , who bastes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and does some tacking and felling by machine . Basting is the process of making long loose stitches on the foundation which are used temporarily to hold the parts together and are removed after the parts are permanently sewed together . Tacking is the process of making short , loose stitches on the foundation and underpart of the garment to hold the parts together . Tacking stitches are not removed but remain permanently in the garment . Felling is the process of making fine stitches to bind parts of the garment together ? usually , lining to cloth ? and may in some cases be the only stitching to hold the parts together . Then the coat passes to the presser , who uses a small electric iron or a pressing machine . Finally , the garment goes to a finisher for sewing on buttons , buckles , and so forth . Note that with the lower-priced garments there is little handling and the emphasis is on speed in production . Assembling coat and lining . The lining is fitted to the coat so that the seams of both coincide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coat being placed on the form wrong side out . The lining is fitted to this with the grain of the lining matching that of the coat and with center front and back lines of the two parts together . The 1-inch fold down the back of the lining is pinned in place . The lining is smoothed out so that it lies flat against the wrong side of the coat . Lining seams are pinned in place . Then the lining is basted , stitched , and pressed , and all seams are fastened to the coat . Lapel facing . Lapel facings are cut like any other fitted facings and applied in the same way ? by placing the two right sides together and then stitching . However , in a coat , additional weight or stiffness is often needed and must be basted in before the facing is applied . This is sometimes provided by basting an inner fac-  | ing to the wrong side of the revers . The inner facing is usually made of a lining crinoline ; but when that is not available , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is cut the same shape as the revers , but is smaller , so that it can be basted just to the seam line . When the facing is turned right side out , it is pressed so that a little of the facing shows on the coat side from the neck to the waistline . When the revers are folded back , the seam is not visible on the right side . Seams . The seams of the lining will be inside , where there will be little friction ; consequently , they need no treatment other than to have about one-half inch in width trimmed and to be pressed flat . The seams of a lined coat and those of an unlined coat require different finishes . In the lined coat , the seams would be treated as just described for the lining . If the coat is unlined , the seams will ravel . A finish is therefore necessary that will prevent raveling and at the same time present a neat appearance . Bias binding of either cotton or rayon is usually satisfactory for this purpose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat . Sometimes a slot seam is used down the center back for decoration . In this case , the back of the coat is cut in two pieces with a seam down the center back . This gives the effect of an inverted box plait or two tucks turned toward each other . The depth of the tuck for a coat is usually from one-half to one inch . Sleeves . The sleeves are set in much as they are in dresses . However , in wool materials , it is easier to dispose of fullness around the top of the sleeve . Gathers are made around the top of the sleeve as in the making of a dress sleeve . The thread is drawn tight to hold in the fullness , and shrunk by pressing with a damp cloth laid over the gathers . This dampness and steaming shrink the fullness out along the seam line and shape the sleeve slightly to fit over the curve at the top of the arm . In fitting sleeves in coats , the same principles that are used in fitting dress sleeves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . Fanciful , elaborate sleeves are difficult to draft and fit .  | Raglan and epaulet sleeves are often used in coats and are set in as they are in dresses . The armscye seam on a coat may be stitched from the inside as in a dress sleeve . If the coat is lined , the seams are left unfinished ; but they are usually pressed back against the sleeve , since this is the way they naturally tend to turn . If the seam is pressed up against the coat , it is usually stitched again from the outside , because this extra stitching is needed to keep the seam edges in place . This is often done on sport coats and gives a pleasing effect . It is also frequently found where epaulet or raglan sleeves are used . Cuffs . Cuffs are attached after the sleeves are sewed up and set into the armscye . They are made double , with both top and lining thickness of the same material . Sometimes they are applied with a bias facing as in dresses . Another satisfactory finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outside . Many sleeves arc finished with a facing or a hem instead of a cuff . hi either case , the hem or facing is turned under far enough and stitched so that the sleeve lining extends over it and is hemmed into place . Collars . Collars usually need the same padding or stiffening that the lapels have . This is cut smaller than the collar by the width of the seam allowances , and is basted to the under thickness or lining . Sometimes the under thickness of the collar and the padding are stitched with parallel lines of stitching to give additional stiffness to make it stand up . The collar is made so that it will lie flat on the shoulders . The undercollar is stretched and eased in a hit , with fullness in the top so that the seams will be slightly on the under side , where they will not show after the collar is turned right side out . It is attached by the convertible collar method used on any other garment . These directions apply to tailored collars . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the neckline with fitted facing which slips under the lining of the coat . Pockets . Pockets must be set in or attached before the lining is put in . Set-in pockets in coats are often made with a flap at-  | tached along the top edge extending down to cover the opening . The flap is cut the desired shape and is usually lined with a lighter-weight material , but sometimes the lining is the same material as the coat . The two thicknesses are stitched together , leaving the flap open along the top edge , and clipped at the corners . Patch pockets on coats are often more involved than on other garments . They are usually lined , either with the same material or with silk . This finishes the inside edges neatly before the pocket is attached . If a flap is applied to the top of the pocket , it is set in the top seam between the two pieces of cloth . Or , if it is a single pocket , the flap is set on with a facing . Fastenings . Coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or loop buttonholes . The worked buttonhole in a coat is made exactly like a tailored buttonhole with the following exceptions : 1 . The slit is cut with a small hole at the outside end so that it will fit well around the thread which holds the button in place . 2 . The buttonhole stitch is worked over a cord to give a firm , tight ridge around the edge . These buttonholes wear better and present a better appearance in tailored garments than do plain worked buttonholes . The loops used on coats are made like those for dresses . They may be sewed into the seam where the facing is joined to the revers , or sewed on the inside of the coat close to the opening . When they are not inserted in the seam , the ends are twisted in a coil to give a decorative effect . The buttons may he sewed on like those for dresses , but it is usually more satisfactory to reinforce them with small buttons placed underneath . When they are reinforced in this manner , both inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this case the buttons are not sewed on until after the lining is sewed in . If they arc not reinforced with small buttons , they are sewed on before the lining is attached . Wrap-around coats , which have a wide lap across the front , also need a fastening on the inside edge . This edge usually has a  | small loop into which a tape ties . This tape is made of the same material as the lining and is sewed securely at the seam . One end of the tape is passed through the loop and the two ends tied to hold the coat closed . Hem . The hemline of the coat is marked like that of the dress , and the hem is turned up to the desired length or depth and trimmed evenly . Coat hems are narrower than dress hems ? usually one or two inches in depth . If the coat is unlined , the raw edge of the hem is bound in the same way as that in which the seams were finished and the bound edge is held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be lined , the hem is turned up and the raw edge is held in place with hand stitching . Higher-priced coats have the lining and the coat body hemmed separately . Less expensive coats have lining and coat stitched together . When the lapel facing and the hem overlap along the two front edges , they give a bulkiness to the closing . This is corrected by trimming off the lower edge of the facing along the finished line of the coat . The raw edge of the facing is then turned under and is stitched to the hem . The higher-price-range garment , after the machine operating and some preliminary basting by the finisher , goes to the presser for under-pressing and then back to the operator , who sews the lining to the facings . The garment then comes back to the finisher , who does all the tacking and felling necessary on seams , facings , and sleeves , makes the bottom hem , and puts padding and shoulders where required . The garment then goes to the presser for another upper-pressing . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final tacking required , sews on buttons , buckles , belts , and so forth . Though it is obvious that the handling here involved is considerably greater than in the lower-range garment , it is nevertheless difficult to describe such intangibles as the care and exactness which impart to a properly fitting garment the quality of " softness . " Finally , the garment is inspected by an examiner who notes whether there are any defects , whether it is spotted , whether the seams are smooth , and whether the measurements are correct .  | In the lower-price-range garments , such examinations are cursory , while in the higher-priced clothes much more exacting . The garments are then packed and shipped as ordered by the buyers of thousands of retail stores in cities , towns , and villages throughout the country . Selection of a coat What use did the designer have in mind when he created this coat ? Material or color frequently determines use . A tweed coat is generally a utility , sports , or casual coat . The same model in satin would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dressy coat for day or evening , although this style when made for women is generally a sports coat . Daytime coats fall generally into four classifications : dressy coats for formal town wear , casual coats acceptable for town or country wear , spectator and sport , and utility and raincoats . Coats for special occasions include riding coats , beach coats , evening coats , and so forth . Coats for town wear are usually black or dark in color . Furred or untrimmed , they are designed for the woman 's figure . The Tuxedo coat and the bloused coat are two important styles in this group , both flattering to the mature woman who does not have a slender figure . The fabrics are luxurious in character and selected rather for their beauty than for utility and long wear . Among the dressy coatings are such fabrics as broadcloth , duvetyn , doeskin , boucle , needlepoint fabrics , Bolivia , velvets and velours , cashmere , and Jacquard motifs of various design . Color and beauty of the cloth add a luxury appeal . Coats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to both the face and the figure . Easy-fitting and comfortable , they do not require the same kind of formal accessories that the dressy coat requires . Coats of this class are made of tweed and tweed-type fabrics , Shetland types , cheviots , twill weaves such as serge , covert , gabardine , Poiret twill , and cavalry twill , and fleeces and other napped fabrics of camel 's hair and wool or wool in combination with other fibers . Pile fabrics are popular for sports coats . Fabrics to be used for casual coats are made in bright pat-  | terns or colors . Pile fabrics made with the coloring of natural furs are sometimes in the market . A white plush with a cotton back and dull acetate rayon pile simulates ermine . Fur effects such as the rosettes of leopard are printed on pile fabrics of various content . Such cloths should not be called fur fabrics , according to a ruling of the Federal Trade Commission : fur fabrics are those actually employing the fur fibers of animals , such as beaver , rabbit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high wool content ; however , knowledge of the warmth of various fabrics has led to the development of cotton coatings for jackets , raincoats , and sports wear . A closely woven cotton fabric , such as Grenfell and Byrd cloth , is found satisfactory for jackets when worn over a lightweight sweater . According to the Cotton Textile Institute , many cotton fabrics are used by ' the coat industry , including treated drills , twills , chevrons , gabardines , heavyweight poplins , velveteen , corduroy , and plaids in tweed effects . These are generally used for sports coats or summer coats . Raincoats are made to be either waterproof or water-repellent . A waterproof garment , like a shoe rubber , is impervious to water from both the inside and the outside . Welded seams prevent water from seeping through holes made by stitching . Rubberized fabric insures true waterproof garments . Water-repellent garments shed the water when one side is dry . A garment of this type is much more comfortable to wear , since a watertight garment becomes hot and uncomfortable . Recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are being used for raincoats and jackets . Terry cloth and other absorbent fabrics are used for beach coats sold not in the coat but in the sportswear department . Riding coats are made from various fabrics such as melton , tweed , gabardine , and covert , with linen or cotton coating for summer coats . Evening coats are luxury items and are made of brocades , velvets , satins , and broadcloth , or fine woolens or worsteds , and are generally brilliant in color or made with luxurious fur or embroidery .  | The season and geography determine the weight and color of a coat . For fall and winter in the northern part of the United States , dark shades or colors of middle value are preferred . For resort and summer wear , pastels or white are favorites . Blue , for many years considered a spring coat color , has been shown for year-around wear since the showing of Italian paintings brought da Vinci 's lovely blues to public attention . Prevailing fashions indicate whether each season 's models will be acceptable the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if successful are " in the market " and generally found in all price brackets . Color . Who decides the colors in which coating fabrics shall be made ? The consumer ? The coat manufacturer ? The fabric manufacturer ? Actually , all three have a part in this decision . Neither the coat manufacturer nor the consumer can purchase a specific texture or color if the fabric manufacturers are not making it . Occasionally a retail store will be able to have a mill dye a fabric in a certain color and sell it only to that store . This gives the mill an opportunity to try out new colors in small quantity before putting them in the entire line . Such exclusive garments are generally priced higher than similar styles with the same workmanship made in larger quantities . The colorist or stylist at the mill observes the sales of families of colors season by season and notes the number of customers using each color . He is alert to public interests , art exhibitions , anniversaries of various historic events , current news , and so forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabrics on women of various color types before making up a large amount of cloth . Black has been the dominant coat color for many years , although , with government restrictions on style , and with requests for conservation of fabric , colors became gay and vivid . Forstmann , in 1943 , showed a range of 81 colors in many textures . This production was possible in spite of the fact that most of the goods produced by the mill were for government orders . Capacity production of all equipment enables the mill to accomplish this difficult production schedule .  | Coating and suiting fabrics Coating and suiting fabrics in the women 's wear department are frequently adapted from men 's wear fabrics . However , the correct texture and weight are of such importance in the construction of a satisfactory coat that one large woolen company making fabrics for both men 's and women 's wear will not permit the men 's wear manufacturers to buy or even to see the women 's wear fabrics , nor the women 's wear manufacturers to use the men 's wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a particular sales policy may seem absurd , but actually it is a practice that safeguards both the fabric and coat manufacturer , the retailer , and the ultimate consumer . Many fabrics in the woolen industry are made in both coating and suiting weights . Coat fabrics are always heavier ? from fourteen to sixteen ounces per yard . Thirty-six-ounce overcoating , used before the advent of the closed automobile , is seldom used today , because men have become accustomed to riding in heated , enclosed cars . Coat fabrics include many kinds of fleeces , that is , napped woolen fabrics , either woven or knitted , made from a variety of fibers ? all wool , camel 's hair , cashmere , llama , vicuna , wool and cotton , wool and rayon , and other combinations . Chinchilla and Montagnac fabrics have a curled surface . Tweed fabrics include the famous Harris tweed made from wool grown in the outer Hebrides , hand-spun , hand-woven , and dyed with vegetable dyestuffs . Donegals are recognized by novelty slubs in different colors . Shetlands are soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Broadcloth is the luxury fabric for formal day or evening coats , always plain and generally in dark or neutral colors . Melton is generally made dark and plain in color . It is a heavier-weight fabric . Officer 's twill or cavalry twill , herringbones , blanket cloth , and double-faced woolens with one side solid and the other plaid are frequently used . Gabardines and coverts are smoothfaced worsteds popular for topcoats . Twills may be either woolen or worsted . Many are made for  | casual or sport coats , although broadcloth , with its napped and polished surface , is an exception . Serge , well known in America before World War I , is the classic twill weave . Others include cavalry twill , Poiret twill , gabardine , and covert . Herringbones are variations of the twill weave . Many novelties are also based on this weave . Boucle , ratine , and eponge are all similar in character , made from a special three-ply yarn producing a curly surface and spongy cloth . Boucle is the coating weight , while ratine and eponge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxurious in character , this fabric makes up well with dressy furs and has long been popular for women 's coats . Woolen coatings in a plain weave are sometimes popular . When coats are detailed with stitching or embroidery , the fabric tends to loose surface interest . Jacquard weaves may be either sports or dressy in character . Plaids , checks , and stripes are identified by the pattern . Knitted coatings are sometimes made to have the appearance of a woven pattern . Wool and Bemberg rayon coatings , with the rayon knitted on the inside to eliminate the necessity for a lining , are excellent for summer wear and are in the market from time to time . Lightweight cotton coatings were first developed for wear by the people in Newfoundland by Sir Hubert Grenfell . Closely woven , of fine cotton , these cloths became widely used for sports jackets and utility coats during the early 1940 's . Wind-resistant and water-repellent , these lightweight inexpensive fabrics make excellent ski jackets , campus coats and raincoats , and coats for children . The reversible cotton gabardine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is similar , and Grenfell cloth are both lightweight coatings in cotton used for both jackets and rain wear . Velveteen and corduroy are two other cotton fabrics regularly used in the coat market . Cotton plaids and tweed-type cloths are always found in the low-priced market . A special kind of cotton that resembles wool in texture and feel is used , and , in patterns that simulate the wool designs , it is difficult  | to detect the true nature of the cloth . Government regulations require the label to state the content of wool and other fibers used in the fabric . Cotton drapery and decorating textiles have been found to make desirable summer coats . Glossary of Coating and Suiting Fabrics Terms used to describe textile fabrics vary in their application and are often misapplied . This is easy to understand in view of the vast number of grades of raw stock , the constructions available , and the fact that the same term may often be applied to fabrics composed of fibers other than wool , alone or in combination . This compilation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York and has been included here to assist in an understanding of wool fabrics and how they may be described . ALPACA The fiber , small in diameter , soft and highly lustrous , from the alpaca , a small domesticated goat of Peru found on the slopes of the Andes Mountains . Alpaca fabrics , strictly speaking , are fabrics made largely of alpaca fibers . The lower-grade fabrics were originally used as linings and the better grades for fine dress goods . The fiber is also used on the face of Montagnacs and other fine overcoatings . One fabric currently being sold as " alpaca " merely resembles an alpaca fabric in finish ; the use of the term for such fabrics is entirely improper . Some rayon crepes are erroneously called " alpaca . " ASTRAKHAN Derived from the curled wool of the pelts of young lambs of the province of Astrakhan , Russia , the term as applied to a coating has come to denote a rough fabric with a closely curled face resembling that of the astrakhan lamb 's pelt . Often made with cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth in a plain weave made in imitation of a plain cambric originally produced by one Jean Baptiste in France .  | A " batiste " is not wool unless so stated . A " wool batiste " should be all wool unless otherwise described . BEDFORD CURD A vertically ribbed cloth of substantial construction used largely for riding breeches , chauffeurs ' uniforms , upholstery , and other purposes where severe wear is encountered . The rib is pronounced and runs in the same direction as the warp . Some lighter-weight Bedford cords have been used for sport trousers and other special purposes . Originally a wool cloth , it is now made of other fibers as well . The term describes the weave rather than the material ; hence , a full description requires mention of the fiber content ? wool , cotton , and the like , or a notation that it is a mixture of two or more of the fibers . BENGALINE A thin fabric made generally of silk or rayon warp and wool filling , usually with a relatively inconspicuous rib running at right angles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular fiber blend . BLANKET CLOTII Heavy , soft , loosely woven , napped wool or cotton fabric , frequently made in plaid or striped yarn-dyed design . BOLIVIA A soft , plush-like fabric of wool , usually containing some specialty wool fiber such as alpaca or mohair . The term is not properly applied to anything but an all-wool product or to any fabric not closely woven of fine stock . BOUCLE A boucle is a fabric woven from curled or specially twisted yarn in such a way as to produce small loops on the surface giving a kinky appearance . It is distinguished from astrakhan because the curled nap does not cover the entire surface but occurs at intervals . This type of fabric is usually made in coating weights but is also made in lighter weights for use as dress goods . All-wool construction is assumed unless otherwise stated . BROADCLOTI I A fine wool cloth openly woven and then fulled or finished to achieve uniform texture . The surface is then napped , closely sheared , and polished . The term was originally applied only to wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also been applied to a cotton cloth of entirely  | different character used principally for men 's shirtings . Not only are the fabric contents wholly dissimilar , but so are the construction , finish , and application or use of these two fabrics , so that there is virtually no opportunity for confusion . ( See Dress goods . ) CAMEL 'S HAIR The hair of the camel , except that comprising the outer coat , is very soft and fine ; in undyed form , it is a light tan . A fabric , merely because it has this distinctive color , however , can not be called " camel 's hair . " The best grade of camel 's hair is very expensive and even in the higher-priced fabrics is sometimes mixed with sheep 's wool or other fibers . Some of the finest cloths of this type produced are mixtures of camel 's hair and wool , and should not he called " 100% Camel 's Hair . " To avoid possible complaints of misrepresentation , the percentage of camel 's hair actually present should be stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cotton candlewick bedspread , with tufted patterns similarly applied . As the term carries no suggestion of any wool content , if the fabric is of wool it should he referred to as " wool candlewick " or " woolen with candlewick pattern . " CASHMERE Originally a fine fabric , or a knitted shawl made from fine wool from the cashmere goat of Tibet . ( The name comes from the fact that the fabric was first made in the Province of Kashmir . ) A real cashmere fabric is woven or knitted from this special wool . It is extremely soft . The total amount of cashmere wool available is strictly limited , and the term should be used only as applying to a 100% cashmere fabric , unless a full description accurately specifies the exact percentage of cashmere content . CASSMERE Not to be confused with cashmere . Strictly defined , a cassimere is a woolen cloth closely woven with a plain twill weave and fulled . In practice , however , most woolen cloths which do not fall into some other classification are referred so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool or of silk and wool . Sometimes made with a woven pattern , but more often printed with designs  | after weaving . The designs are commonly of the type found in silk goods . A challis ( pronounced shallay ) is not only very thin and light in weight , but is also soft and pliable . A challis of necessity is of fine yarn with a high number of picks and ends per inch . CHEVIOT A rough , somewhat harsh woolen fabric made from the coarser wools such as are grown on the sheep of the Cheviot Hills in the north of England . Cheviots are woven from somewhat finer yarns than are used in typical tweeds , and are usually made in either plain colors or herringbones ; they also may he made in other fancy patterns . They are woven from woolen yarns , except for the more expensive cheviots , which are made from worsted yarns , generally in high colors and referred to as " worsted cheviots . " CHINCHILLA A thick , heavy , napped cloth used for women 's and children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface in imitation of the fur of the animal of that name . The tufts are close together and cover the entire surface . Generally dyed in the piece in solid colors . Always assumed to be an all-wool fabric unless otherwise stated . There is no resemblance to the fur chinchilla . COTTON COATINGS Drills , gabardines , and heavy cotton poplins treated to be waterrepellent . Blanket cloth , cotton tweeds , Donegals , hopsacking , heavy crash , and combinations of cotton with other fibers are used for summer coats and for resort wear . COVERT Twilled cloth made from highly twisted yarns , usually of two colors , so that the fabric has a speckled appearance . Closely woven with a fine , smooth face . Originally made for hunting clothes , because its smooth surface did not catch on brambles . Now used largely for men 's topcoats and women 's coats or mannish-tailored suits . WOOL CREPE " Crepe " is a term that was originally applied to a certain type of silk fabric . A " wool crepe " is a lightweight worsted fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is obtained by using either a fancy weave or a plain weave with warp yarns which are hard-twisted in alternate directions . The term is rather indefinite and  | is often applied also to lightweight worsted fabrics for women 's wear that have little or no crepe surface . If it is a wool fabric , the words " wool crepe " rather than merely " crepe " should he used . DOESKIN A very close and compact wool cloth with exceptionally smooth face ( resembling soft chamois ) . The weave is similar to that of a sateen , but the smooth finish of the cloth generally obliterates any trace of the weave on the face . The term is especially appropriate as applied to fine white or light-colored suiting and trouserings used for men 's wear . The word is also used to describe a fabric used in women 's coats , but should not be employed unless the material is compact and exceedingly smooth in finish . DUVETINE , DUVETYN A closely finished fine coating and suiting lightly napped , created by Rodier , the famous French fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally made of woolen yarn but sometimes with worsted yarn used in the warp or filling . Usually woven with a twill , which , however , may be obscured by the nap . Distinguished for its softness . Used for bathrobes , skirts , men 's suits and trousers , and so forth . Cotton flannel is not dissimilar in appearance . The word flannel if used alone denotes an all-wool fabric . FLEECE A wool fabric with a deep , soft nap . This term may be properly applied to flat woven or knit woolen fabrics as well as to other fabrics woven on the pile principle . If cotton or other fibers are used in the construction of the base fabric so that the fabric is not in fact all wool , statements as to fiber content should be carefully worded to avoid possible misrepresentations . The long nap or pile , as the case may be , provides a wealth of air spaces and hence results in a fabric with a high insulating value against cold . GABARDINE A firm , hard-finished fabric with a fine diagonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater number of ends in the warp , which brings out the twill line . Properly and generally understood to mean a " worsted gabardine " unless stated to be of cotton or other fibers .  | HOMESPUN A coarse and loosely woven woolen material made to simulate the actual homemade cloth . In effect a coarse rough tweed . The yarn is usually heavy and contains coarse fiber wools unevenly spun . HOPSACKING A rough , open-weave woolen fabric made of coarse yarn usually in a basket weave . Used for novelty effects . JERSEY An elastic knitted fabric made from either woolen , worsted , or other yarns . It is defined in the dictionary as " woolen stockinet . " The rib which results from the knitting is clearly discernible on one side of the fabric . As applied to outerwear fabrics , " jersey " is assumed to mean all-wool unless it is otherwise stated . KASHA A fabric woven of the wool from a goat from Tibet , originated by Rodier , the French fabric creator . KERSEY A medium-weight woolen cloth well fulled in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weave . Used extensively for military and civil uniforms . MACKINAW A heavy woolen fabric without nap but heavily fulled or felted to protect against the cold . No weave is apparent on the surface . In general , of construction the same as a melton , except that the latter is usually made in plain colors whereas mackinaw cloth is commonly woven with large distinctive plaids or color effects . Usually made of the coarser wools . MELTON A well-fulled or felted overcoating fabric with smooth finish and no nap . Generally made in plain colors . The coarser meltons are similar to mackinaw cloth but the fabric is sometimes made of fine soft wools to produce a smooth coating with a finish not unlike that of a broadcloth . MOHAIR Mohair is the hair of the Angora goat , and is relatively smooth and lustrous when compared to sheep 's wool . For this reason it does not  | readily felt . Texas is the source of most of the mohair produced in this country . Yarns and fabrics of mohair are bright and lustrous too , sometimes bordering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are generally employed in the manufacture of flat mohair fabrics . The mohair-pile fabrics used in automobiles and for upholstery usually have the pile introduced as a warp but in such a fashion that the special system of threads is not subjected to severe tension . Properly speaking , there is no such thing as mohair weave . However , in the automobile trade the term mohair is generally used to distinguish pile upholstery from flat-woven upholstery . NUN 'S VEILING A fine , lightweight , plain-weave woolen fabric , very soft and thin ? originally used for veils but now utilized for women 's and children 's dresses . ( Plain colors . ) PLAID BACK A type of construction used in overcoatings . The face of the fabric may be finished as a melton , fleece , or similar material , whereas the back is a fancy or tartan plaid . This construction entails the weaving of two fabrics simultaneously in the loom . These two fabrics are united by the interlacing of the warp or filling yarns of the face and back cloths in such a fashion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POPLIN ( WOOL ) Originally a fabric having a silk warp and a filling consisting of a wool yarn heavier than the silk which produced a ribbed surface something like a rep . Now made of different fibers or combinations thereof . A " poplin " without further description should properly be silk and wool . If all-wool , it should be called " wool poplin . " RABBIT 'S HAIR Rabbit 's hair is seldom used in woven or knitted fabrics except in combination with other fibers . The fiber is soft and lustrous . Seldom is it the chief fiber used in a mixture , but in the better fabrics enough may be present to give them a distinctive hand and quality and to justify the use of the term . Because " Angora " is the name of both a breed of goats and a breed of rabbits and might therefore lead to confusion , it should not be used alone , particularly in describing fabrics made partly of wool and partly of either of these special hair fibers .  | RATINE A rough or pebbly surfaced woven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of novelty yarns of fancy twist . The term does not necessarily denote an all-wool fabric . SAXONY A smooth wool fabric originally made from wool grown in Saxony . The term is applied to certain flannels and to fine , clear-finished woolen fabrics made from fine wools similar in nature to Saxony wools . The limits of the application of the term are somewhat indefinite , but it denotes quality and a fine , soft , well-finished fabric . SERGE A fabric with diagonal twill and smooth finish . The twill is visible both on the surface and on the back . Blue is the color most commonly used , but other plain colors are made for certain purposes . Probably the best-known term in the entire wool industry . The word is always interpreted as referring to an all-wool fabric . WOOL SHARKSKIN A term descriptively applied to wool fabrics woven in a 2-and-2 right-hand twill , with a I-and-1 color arrangement of yarns in the warp and filling . This combination of weave and color results in color lines running diagonally to the left , opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctly sleek appearance and hand which suggest the texture of the skin of the shark . Modifications of this design are often loosely designated as sharkskin . WOOL SHEERS A general classification under which may be grouped all thin , lightweight woolen fabrics for women 's wear . Usually woven from worsted yarns , although some woolen fabrics are sufficiently thin to be classified as sheers . SHETLAND Originally a fabric , woven from the wool of the sheep in the Shetland Islands , distinguished for its hairy nature and fine but strong fiber . The term is now applied to fabrics made of wool of like characteristics . Shetlands are soft and a bit " mushy . " The herringbone weave is common in Shetland fabrics , but the term " Shetland " describes the type of wool and not the weave .  | SNOW CLOTH A term employed to designate many fabrics designed for outdoor winter use . It may be applied to meltons , kerseys , heavy flannels , and similar fabrics , and often is used to indicate that these fabrics have , in addition to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them water-repellent . SUEDE A fine , soft fabric with close-clipped nap made to imitate suede leather . The term does not indicate that the fabric is necessarily allwool , unless described as " wool suede . " TWEED An all-wool fabric term broadly applied to the sturdier types of fabrics made of the coarser grades of wool . Tweed fabrics originally derived their interest from their color effects , as the yarns were usually multicolored ones obtained by mixing stock-dyed wools . More recently , the term has been broadened to include monotones which derive their interest from weave effects . The most popular weaves for tweeds are the plain , the twill , and variations of the latter . TWILL A weave which results in a diagonal line running either to the right or the left of the fabric and which is apparent on the face of the material in varying degrees of prominence , unless obliterated or hidden by the finishing processes . Texture of warp and filling and the degree of twist in the yarns are two factors which greatly influence the degree of prominence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many different types of fabrics , but is incorrectly applied unless the weave is in fact a twill or one of its variations . TWISTS Any fabric made of highly twisted yarns . Usually , the yarns are two or more ply , being twisted together before weaving . The characteristics of the cloth are firmness and crispness , and the tendency to hold a press . The twist refers to the type of yarn and does not indicate any particular weave . TROPICAL WEIGHTS Lightweight suitings of woolen or worsted , usually the latter , used for men 's and less frequently for women 's summer suits and dresses . Any all-wool suiting material of light weight can be so classified . The  | weave should be firm but open , as the fabric is especially designed for hot-weather wear . The Federal Trade Commission considers that the term " tropical worsted " should be applied only to an all-worsted fabric . Many fabrics containing a percentage of other fibers are now being offered : such may be referred to as " tropicals , " but not as " tropical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a closely cut pile face . The upright pile , which yields in any direction , gives it an exceedingly smooth hand . If of wool , it should be referred to as " wool velour . " VICUNA The short , soft , exceedingly fine wool of a South American animal of the camel family that is found in Peru . The wool is very valuable because of the limited supply . Owing to the cost , it is rarely used by itself , although a few vicuna coats are manufactured each year . The fiber is sometimes mixed with wool to produce special soft coating fabrics . The term , and certain derived and coined names , have been much misused . WHIPCORD A sturdy wool fabric with a pronounced diagonal wale . It is closely woven and clear-finished , and is principally used for riding habits and in other garments subjected to hard wear . In the heavier weights it is used as upholstery . ZIBELINE A hairy-faced cloth with a lustrous surface . The name is derived from a small fur-bearing animal of the sable family found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its appropriateness is open to question . Furs The person who hopes to sell or buy furs requires technical knowledge beyond the scope of this book . However , those working with fashion merchandise in buying , advertising , display , fashion shows , and editorial work should be informed concerning government regulations , fur fashions , and the correct use of furs for various occasions .
