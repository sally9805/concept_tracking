Along the East Coast and in the Southwest , the U.S. was hot and dry last week . Rain came in dribbles , or not at all , and temperatures sizzled above 100 . In other parts of the country grain , vegetables and fruit grew fat and ripe . But there were not enough men , women &; children to gather them in , store and process them . The U.S. food supply was running a dangerous race against : 1 ) drought , 2 ) manpower troubles. * <P> Rain Shortage . In Montgomery County , Md. , one and a half inches of rain had fallen since June 18 ( seven to eight inches would have been normal ) . Typical of troubled U.S. farmers who searched the sky for rain was Montgomery County 's John Stiles . In a lifetime of farming , he could not remember a worse dry spell . <P> For the past six weeks Farmer Stiles has been rising an hour earlier than usual , just to poke around his parched 440 acres . Last week the pea vines were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beans were all that had been salvaged from the quarter-acre vegetable patch . <P> Grazing grass , as usual , was the heat 's first victim . Down in the browned pasture , 40-odd cattle stood at the fence eying a distant field of ragweed , which looks green but makes no milk . This summer John Stiles , like many another drought-pinched U.S. farmer , is using up his next winter 's cattle feed . <P> Studying his hillside corn , Farmer Stiles found that a yellow burn from the dry ground was creeping up the stalks . In his bottomland the stalks stood straighter and greener , but they were far too short for August corn . <P> The drought will probably cost John Stiles and his Maryland neighbors : 10 to 25% in milk , 37% in corn , 50% in late vegetables . In Virginia the potato crop was hit ; in Delaware the dry spell took toll of tomatoes , limas , string beans , peaches . Total estimated crop damage in states bordering Washington , D.C. : $50 million . <P> Other drought damage : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cotton was not hurt very much by heat . But grain sorghums were in danger . Cattle were being fed on silage . Said the Dallas News : " Unless the drought and heat are broken within a week , the crop and livestock situation could become serious . . . . " The onetime dust bowl got a good rain . But June-filled water holes in trie Panhandle were drying up ; feed and water for livestock were scarce . <P> &gt;Oklahoma , thirstier for rain than it has been for seven years , frankly reported a " bad drought . " Cotton opened prematurely . Corn was about 57% of normal . Peanuts were expected to be a total loss . Wheat was less than half of last year 's production ( 29 million bu. v. 61 million bu . ) . Pastures and stock ponds dried up , made the feed shortage so acute that many cattlemen were sending their livestock to market ahead of schedule . <P> Labor Shortage . Outside Campbell Soup 's Camden , N.J. plant more than 100 freight cars waited to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks , carrying 3,200 tons of tomatoes , stretched down the road in a fourmile , bumper-to-bumper line . Estimated need of southern New Jersey canners : 3,300 able-bodied male workers .
