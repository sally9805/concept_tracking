ON TM ; fourth of February , I arrived in the of- fice at 8.00 A.M. , saluted Herr Jurk with all the respect due a Kommandofithrer , and sat down beside him as usual . I lined the desk with papers , reports , individual cards , and began my clerical work . Jurk seemed to have drunk too much the previous night . Between his elbows , the silent telephone rested like an empty bottle . Ile was watching a little black spot on the wall . Around nine o'clock , I rubbed my cheek and sighed . At ten , Lamy , the postmaster-nurse , came is , clapped his heels , and inquired if a package of mail had arrived from the censor 's office . " No , " I answered , " but have you some aspirin in the camp pharmacy ? " Ile brought me two tablets . I took one immediately , and the other sometime in the afternoon . On the fifth of February , I took two tablets again . On the sixth , I took three . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply , and I asked Herr Jul ( if he would allow a whole box to be bought for me by a sentry . I showed him my cheek , which was very red . " Jo ! " he barked . When , around the tenth , my cheek began to swell , I could see that Jurk expected me to break down and beg to go to the hospital . But I did not . My table was littered with aspirin tablets . Any time that he looked in my direction , I picked up one , broke it carefully in small pieces , mixed it with a little water , and swallowed the medicine while making a face . But when , on the morning of Friday the thirteenth , I appeared with an enormously swollen cheek , and a mouth so distorted that I could hardly speak , he rose and burst out loudly that only imbeciles or cowards were afraid to have their teeth pulled out . He himself had got rid of most of his teeth . Whether I wanted it or not , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . Now clear out and go to bed ! As a favor I asked permission to stay until lunch time , to finish the most urgent part of my work , the reports . At 1e.30 I asked if the new interpreter could take my place that night . Sure , sure ! All he wanted was for inc to take that obscene abscess of mine out of his sight ! So I arranged my papers , pens , pencils , and little bottles , picked up my aspirin , and pushed my stool under the desk , noiselessly . Martinet was waiting for me in my corner . " Everything is all right , " he said . " A comrade is lying on a bunk directly by the stairs . If anyone comes in , he 'll cough ; and I 'll pretend to have brought you some water . " I undid my bed and messed it up carefully . On my stool , I sprinkled aspirin tablets and set two cups . In one , I poured water from a pitcher . In the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunk of cotton . It had been almost as uncomfortable as a real one . " Fine , Marquet ! Now listen to me . Go to the latrines and wait until no one is near you . Poke your hand through the seventh , ninth , and eleventh holes , to your left , You 'll find that packages are hidden there , directly under the board . They are in a net of strings fastened with short nails . Get hold of the package first , then cut the strings and pull . You 'll need your topcoat to hide them under . " He went , yawning and stretching his arms . " Hell ! I have diarrhea again , " I heard him tell someone on the stairs . I inspected my suit case : two pairs of woolen socks , two sets of underwear , half a pound of tobacco , and a package of all my wife 's letters . I pushed it under the bunk and set my shoes beside it not too orderly . Then I unearthed my brief case and polished it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little tobacco , two recent issues of has Reich , a new toothbrush , a new razor that Marquet had bought for me in the canteen , a little cake of soap , a towel , two small sandwiches , and a heavy brown package . Someone coughed . I slid under the blankets , hugging my brief case . It was only Marquet , looking pregnant . " Here 's one , " he said . " I 'm afraid it smells a little . I have to return for the others . " Then I heard him groaning on the stairs : " here I go again . I sha n't sleep a wink today . Damn ruta-bagas ! " I had feared the odor , so I had wrapped my packages in many newspapers , which should have absorbed most of it . It would evaporate quickly , once in the open . I had never realized before how splendid may overcoat was , Could anyone believe that it had once been a British officer 's coat ? Of course I had changed the metal buttons for large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had retouched the collar and the half belt . Dyeing it had not been really difficult , but long . I had paid twenty marks for each ounce of the precious dyeing powder , at the prisoners ' black market , and it had taken me two months to obtain it . Then I had borrowed a large basin and obtained warm water in the kitchen , on the pretext of delousing my clothes . In the night , I had hidden in the tiller room , and with a pail and some stolen charcoals I had improvised a stove . Now I could see my masterpiece in the open . It bad only two regrettable s I reaks ? being lighter in the middle of the back where , perhaps , the material had been greasy . Anyway , I adored it . I had it on when Marquet came back , holding my trousers under his coat as if he had a tummy-ache . The trousers had cost me only fifteen marks one evening when , a search having been announced , one of my neighbors had become frantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't quite long enough for me ; the seat was far too large and the legs too narrow . The cloth had once been black . Now it wavered between green in the top part and brown for the rest . Fortunately , stripes of light gray , as large as a finger , ran vertically and provided unity to the trousers . They gave the impression of having been painted rather than woven . Even so , the trousers looked good to me as I put them on . It was only 3.00 P.M. We still had three hours to go . I washed and shaved . Only at the last minute would I put vaseline on my hair , to hold it completely flat . That would change my appearance and also enable me to stick my hat on . That hat was a gift of love : it had been stolen expressly for me by a grateful comrade . I had kept it rolled up , but the dampness had penetrated the successive layers of paper , and now it refused to stay straight . It waved around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hot . iron that we could n't possibly get now . This worried me very much , and I fought with the brim for a good hour . Finally I set it flat on my suitcase and laid my books on top of it . 2 AT .5.30 I dressed completely . My apple-green coat was much too small and certainly the worst part of my outfit , but it would n't show much under the brown topcoat . I put my spectacles in my pocket , and my hat in my bosom . I covered my head with Marquees largo winter cap . Over my civilian clothes I slipped a large Belgian overcoat , borrowed for the occasion . With my long infantry knickers over my civilian trousers , and my sabots , no sentry would spot me . I paused in the open to see if the stage was set . The snow had stopped falling . Groups of prison . ers were coming in every five minutes . I saw them coming from under the bridge , on Altdammerstrasse , then disappearing behind a barrack , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and the sentry greeted his colleagues when they passed with their prison . ers . The incoming column advanced in the yard as far as the kitchen and stopped . Judas , the German clerk who had been warming himself inside , came out with his check sheet and the new interpreter . He counted the men and then dismissed them . The prisoners went to get their soup bowls ; the sentries went to their barracks . As on yesterday , a little group was gathering around the volley-ball ground . Two boys had begun sweeping the snow away with a board . The sentry at the gate was watching them with interest . The teams were forming now , five on each side . A few other prisoners lined against the windows of the Lagerfahrung , watching the game while they ate . Someone touched my fingers on the railing . It was David . " Everyone 's at his post , " he said . I went down the chicken ladder . I dragged my sabots by the guards ' barrack , reached the latrines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crowd inside , some on the seats , others watching the yard through the small side-windows , set high , just under the ceiling . Marquet waited for me in the very last cell and handed me my shoes . He had polished them too much , I thought . They shone like patent leather . An amateur shoemaker had bored many decorative little holes on the top piece to disguise the many little patches of different kinds of leathers with which a completely useless pair of civilian shoes had been rebuilt . They were so big that I could wear two pairs of thick socks , which was good . ' they felt incredibly light on my feet . Could they really pass for shoes ? I took off my army knickers and flung the big Belgian coat over my shoulders , like a cape , sleeves free . I held my hat underneath . Marquet said , " Come on ! " I followed him out . I crossed the whole yard , waited to let a group of prisoners pass , and then joined the little group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back between the last two windows . Finot , Marquet , David , and Moineau grouped themselves in front of me . Six o'clock : the sentry was being replaced . The hateful little Reipsch was taking his turn . He was already in a bad humor . He began pacing the width of the gate , endlessly , from one post to the other , " The lookout is pulling out his handkerchief , " Pinot said . I unbuttoned the Belgian coat . The volley-ball game was becoming hot . I could recognize Desprez and Duclos , jumping high after the ball . " The man on the latrine steps is blowing his nose , " announced Moineau . " All clear . Here comes the Brandt group . Get ready . " The thirty men passed by us . Their sentry followed , a little wearily . Judas , the clerk , came out of the kitchen . Four hands were stretched towards me behind my comrades : Marquet held my brief case ; Finot held a wallet with my money and papers in it ; Moineau and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They felt rough , warns , and kind . At this moment the ball hit the ground , two of the players slipped and fell , and Duclos ran towards Desproz with Isis fists raised . " It 's your fault , dirty cheater ! " he cried , and knocked him down brutally . The prisoners began to shout . Judas ran towards the game . The sentry , Reipsch , followed in the same direction . " Adieu , " murmured David . " Adieu , everybody , " and quickly placing the Belgian coat on David 's shoulders , my hat cocked over my eyes , holding my brief case tight , I sho t ou t , exactly three yards behind Reipsch . I began to count , slowly . One . . . At two I passed through the gate , At three I walked normally at right angles to the right . Five seconds ! They had not seen me ! I was now exactly opposite the private exit of the Lagerfithrung . From the yard 1 looked as though I were coming out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , a joy that I had never felt before in my life ! Why had I waited so long , so long , to feel it ? Never had walking been so delicious . My feet balanced lightly under me . The twist of my face that I wore as a mask had no more weight than a smile . The world around me was so bright , so loud ; the steps of another group , coming towards me from the street , sounded so clear : one , two , one , two . . . I lowered my head so that they would n't recognize me ; and I looked at their shoes , their wooden shoes , their torn trousers , the patches of which I knew so well : these belonged to Jacques , these to Martin , these to Louis , dragging snow behind their weary steps ; oxen driven back to the stable ; slaves pushed back into their jails ; my companions , my own companions whom I was abandoning to their fate ! Then I bumped into the sentry in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pardon . " " Pardon , " I murmured ? but not to him . 3 ONCE on Altdammerstrasse , I followed the sidewalk . A streetcar stopped by me , but not knowing the ticket system , I did n't dare take it . Also , dreaded sitting down and offering my costume and my face to two dozen people who had nothing to do but look at my oddities . It was safer to walk normally , not too fast , not too slow . Bridges are dangerous spots , It is on bridges that , at given hours , the policemen begin asking for credentials from everyone . I dared to look at the officer on duty on the Hansabrticke . He smiled at me and said , " It 's cold . " " jai " I answered . It helped me . I was all right if policemen smiled at me . Das Reich , neatly folded , stuck out of my pocket . Who but an excellent citizen read Dr. Goebbels 's prose ? Beyond the bridge I should turn to the left , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had confused the way . I had studied it on a map and verified it the last time I had been in the city ; but it did n't look the same , now that I walked on the sidewalk instead of in the glitter and no guard held me on a leash . I arrived at the railway station at 6.45 . The train I meant to board left at 6.55 . I went to the ticket window for main lines and waited behind a young man . He held his identity card . I could see the large violet stamp with a stiff broad eagle holding a swastika in its claws , but I could n't read the name . " One way to Metz , " he said when his turn came . " Sorry , " answered the employee , " the train for Berlin is full . No more tickets for the capital , or any point beyond , until we know there 'll be room in another . " " When will that be ? " " Probably tomorrow morning at 5.50 . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if to himself , withdrawing from the line . I followed him and asked : " Why do you say Merde ? " He looked at me ? an open face with laughing eyes . " Merde is what we say in Alsace , in such a case . " " That 's what we say sometimes in Antwerp , though it would be more usual in Liege , " I answered him in German , and we began to talk . I helped him out of the way with his n1 ) 11/ ( ' 01/8 pieces of baggage , and he informed me that he was going tone on his semiannual leave , for ten days only . I told him that I was in the same case , but going in the direction of Brussels . " Then , " he said , " we 'll travel together as far as Berlin . Let 's have a glass of beer . " Did the Alsatian really mean what he had said : " At 8.30 by the Catholic church " ? I tramped alone along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't caught yet . 1 had foreseen this possibility . Ever since December the Pommersehe Zeilung had given wide publicity to successive reductions in the railway traffic , but it was a poor beginning for me . A shadow by a door ; it 's a man ; a civilian . He 's looking at me ? at me only . Danger ! Fool , what have I done ? I marched straight towards him , for the fight . " Good evening . I 'm glad to meet someone at last . Could you tell me what time it is ? " " It 's eight o'clock , " he answered , " but what are you doing in this forbidden area ? " " 1 ? I work for the Hafengesellschaft , on the Iteiherwerderhafen pier , on the other side . We 've been unloading Swedish ore today . I 'm going home to Antwerp , on leave ? in Belgium , you know . But I missed the evening train ? it was full . Now I must try to catch another tomorrow at .. , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man turned on a flashlight . This yellow sheet .. . no , this is only my permit . I opened it enough for him to see the police stamp on it . " It must be this ; yes , 5.50 A.m . Is n't that painful ? So I 'm going to meet a friend at 8.30 , by the Catholic church , and we 'll spend the evening together . As I 've never worked on these piers I was looking around a bit . Fabulous cranes . They must lift at least one hundred tons , do n't they ? 1 had n't realized this was forbidden area . I did n't see any sign . Anyway , I 'm getting cold , and would rat her have a chink . Could you tell me where I can find a. little . Bierkuus with good pre-war stuff ? " " Blame it 00 the British , " he laughed . " The beer is n't what it used to be ; but there 's a fairly good place where I go myself . Come along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Thanks . Wo n't you have one too ? " " I wish I could , but I 'm on duty around here until midnight . You 'd better clear off these grounds soon , anyway . " I did n't need any more warning . The beer was fair . I swallowed it slowly , in case he changed his mind and followed me . Then out again . Pacing up and down the wide street , from the church to the bridge , and from the bridge to the church , was risky . I 'd wait only five minutes more . . . . Not until nine o'clock did the Alsatian arrive . With him was another man . " This is my Flemish comrade , " he introduced me , " How do you do ? " We shook hands , went quietly along the street , entered a door , climbed three flights of steps , and sat in a warm little room under the roof . " Men , you 'll be better off waiting here for that early train than having to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said our host . We chatted pleasantly about our work ? I about the Swedish boats , they about the factory where they were mechanics . Then the Alsatian engaged in a private discussion with his friend and I did n't listen any more . 4 Sl'NK deep in a cheap armchair , I was exhilarated . My imitation of a Nazi police stamp was good if it had fooled a plain-clothes man . I had copied it from documents in the office , but nothing is more dangerous than a flashlight shining obliquely . The streaks left by the indelible pencil show up then , even when they have been softened with a wet blotter . My speech had gone well . I was listening to it as if another person had spoken for Inc . A policeman is like a fence : in order to pass , you have to walk up to him unhesitatingly . You must n't allow him to form an opinion of you before you have told him everything he would ask you why you speak with an accent , where you come from , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mantel struck eleven . This was the moment when Jork made his last round of the prison . Ile would find my bunk empty , but , normally so . It was messed up ; half a dozen aspirin tablets dotted my stool . My shoes lay in the way . Ile should conclude that I had gone to the night privy . On the shelf , he could see my military identification booklet , a bunch of letters from my wife , a package of American tobacco , a razor , a toothbrush , and a small cake of soap . These were previous items . Only when he retired would Desprez and Duelos arrive , take away my letters and photographs to burn , and my tobacco and underclothes to divide , as they had already shared the other pieces of my uniform after their mock fight at the volley-ball game . roil a quarter to six in the morning , nothing would happen . Then the Slobberer would look for ate to line up the sick for him , as usual , and would he told thatI was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the latest : , Jurk would be hollering around the camp , his pistol drawn . The gre.m.st danger would begin then . I should be sought everywhere . The Alsatian stirred me up around 4.30 A , M. Without realizing it , I had dozed in the chair . Ile had shared his comrade 's bed . We did n't disturb ' tin I carried some of the Alsatian 's luggage , and it gave me poise . The street , was very slippery , and air steps echoed against the walls . At five o'clock se stood in line for our tickets , behind many others . Re woman att , the window hardly glanced at my yellow paper , stamped it , and gave me a ticket direct to Antwerp , for 38 marks 50 . The gate to the platform was closed again . The blackboard above said the train would be thirty minutes late , because of the snow , of course ; but what a catastrophe ! I hated waiting in this hall where so many men I knew could come : officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburbs , sentries going to , or returning from , leave . It was a slim chance . At six o'clock sharp , we were admit ted to the platform . At OM , the train had n't arrived . I knew what was going on in the office at this very minute . My neighbors at the camp had admitted that they had n't seen Inc since last night . Jurk would n't search any more . He would go through the regular routine that I had witnessed before . My green identification card in one hand , and the telephone in the other , he would call up successively the Kentrollstelle , the Stettin Police Presidium , the Railway Police , the Highway Police , and the Stalag via long distance . He would give a succinct description of me ; the Stalag would send out copies of my photograph and of my fingerprints . The late edition of tine Pommersehe Zeitung would contain this notice : ? " Warning . French prisoner of war at large . Jean Mon , 5 feet 6 , 140 pounds , speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Report all suspects immediately to the nearest . police station . " While waiting for the Kontrollezier , Jurk would fill out the " Notice of Escape " in triplicate . Along with the circumstances of my disappearance , the reason for the flight would be given . A reason ? was it naive or humorous ? At 6.30 the station loud speakers roared " Attention ! Attention . . . " but it was n't yet about me . It was only to say that the train now entering the station was reserved exclusively for the NArehrmacht . My companion swore loudly . I did n't say anything . At 6.50 another train arrived . I could n't believe I 'd ever board it , for crowds fought at every door . Greatly hindered by the Alsatian 's baggage , I finally got in , last of all . Someone on the platform was saying : " Happy trip . " A happy trip  --  to whom ? The train started . I heard only " Attention ! Attention ! " echoing from the loud speaker . The rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheels . People surged from the car ahead of mine and pushed inc back irresistibly towards the middle of the corridor . But no train is ever so completely packed that a little room ca n't be made after patient adjustments . The Alsatian was four removed from me ; I could see hint telling something about her suitcase to a rather pretty girl . We were in the center of the train . With the condition of the corridors , neither the controller of tickets nor the controller of identification papers could advance more than a car length an hour , I should think . This was a non-stop express , due at Berlin in two and a half hours ? let 's say three , with the snow . If my speculation was correct , they would arrive at me only when nearing the capital . I repeated my name to myself , and remembered that I had lost fifteen years from my age and was now only twenty-three . Did that mean I was born in 1919 or 1920 ? I could n't remember , to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policemen to ask you , when they are holding your papers : " Born on ? " I could read mentally the whole paper : " Josef Vanuytrecht , crane driver , unmarried , living in Antwerp , now working for the Hafengesellsehaft in Stettin , on leave until February 22 , born on 2. 17. 19 " ? or was it 20 ? I had to make sure at once . I pulled out my wallet and reviewed my weapons : my yellow ticket of leave had already been under fire twice ; it should be all right , now that the Stettin station stamp was on it , even if I had n't known about a serial number required in a corner , or some other detail . I had paid 100 marks to have it stolen from a shelf in the barrack of the food overseer . A comrade had watched for an opportunity for two months , and then snatched it . It was well worth the money . It was easy to fill Rout according to the printed indications . Where it said " Police stamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we had several samples on various documents in the office . I was more worried about the other credential ? the passport ? though I felt warmly about it . It was a gift from David . Every morning he took coal to each office . Ile had seen a stack of civilian workers ' passports ( just handed in after their ret urn from leave ) on a table , and had taken one behind his employer 's back . This he had presented to me on February 3 . " Why do n't you keep it for yourself , David ? " " No ; I 'd feel like a thief if I kept it , instead of feeling proud . I want you to have it , if it can be of any use to you . " That was just like my David ? ready to escape on certain conditions only , and not at any price . Desprez had spent hours every night copying ex- actly every little line . We had unglued the tax stamp from one of the oldest visas and transferred it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 the job was completed , and it was n't bad . What was bad , very bad , was that the description of this man could n't be changed : he was twenty-three years old while I was thirty-eight ; it was written in several places , and an erasure would have been very obvious . Furthermore , I had no suitable photograph of myself to substitute for his , even if the stamp , in relief , on it could be successfully imitated . With my hair oiled flat , I could perhaps be considered as having been flattered by the photographer , if only it quick glance were cast on the picture ; but who would ever believe that I was six feet tall when I lacked six incites ? Only when sitting could I pass . Another impossibility was the date : how could a man , back fourteen days ago , according to the last immigration stamp , be going on leave again ? That passport was a good-looking document but should never be looked at closely . I did n't hope to pass the border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my presence on a westbound train . When I came out of the washroom , the controller was already there , sooner than I 'd expected . lie held out his hand . I put everything I had in it , ticket and papers . I smiled as bravely as I could and felt that the end had come . Instead , he only tore off part of the ticket and handed me back the papers , saying : " Show them to the policemen over there . " There were two , coming from the rear , fighting their way slowly from compartment to comport. ment . They spent several minutes on each person . I had no chance to survive such an attentive examination . The train slowed down , the brakes ground , the Alsatian called to me : " Give me a hand again , please ! I 'll pass you my bags through the window . " I was the first one off the train . It had n't even stopped entirely . The policemen did n't yell after me. 5 IREMEMBERED this railway station . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . Now . full of soldiers , it was as dark as ever , but more noisy . We sat right in the middle of the room . " What will you have ? " the Alsatian asked the pretty girl he had met on the train . " Coffee , " she said , without laughing . " And two beers , " he told the waiter , without even asking me . I had carried all of his luggage , while he had carried the girl 's . She was young and fresh , with a large black hat slightly raised in frost . Ile was courting her rather ardently . She called the Peter , and he called her Truda . He had already told her about me . On the pretext of washing , I left them alone for ten minutes and ate one of xi Iwee sandwiches so that my head would stop turning . This was ahead of schedule , and the next day would be one of complete famine . When I went back , they were talking to three or four policemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried Peter , indicating me . " And I 'm sure he 'll give you more than I can afford to . " So the policemen turned towards me with large smiles . The first one pinned a beautiful swastika , in ersatz copper , on my chest ? would I have believed such a day could come ? ? while the second shook his collection box under my nose . I dropped two marks in it , and the third persuaded me to buy the respective portraits of Hitler , Goring , Goebbels , Rosenberg , Von Schirach , for one mark each . For IIimmler , I positively refused . " I 'm ruined , " I insisted , but they were quite pleased with their business at only one table , and explained that this whole collection would be for the exclusive benefit of the police forces fighting in Russia . I had never felt so friendly towards any police before . They assured me that they had much sympathy for the Flemish workers coming to the rescue of the German factories . While all this bargaining went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they were now going away . Remember this theorem : " The best defense against a policeman is another policeman . " Peter telephoned for me to the two stations , inquiring about trains to Cologne , and I learned , to sir disgust , that there would be none until possibly 11.00 P.M. He himself had decided not to leave until the next scorning , perhaps because Truda was counting on spending the day shopping , arid returning to Stettin late in the night . " Why do n't you two come shopping with me ? " she said . So Peter checked his luggage . I would n't part with my brief case . We took the subway and I found that my railway ticket entitled me to free transportation . On Potsdamerplatz , what was once the biggest Jewish store had been rechristened with a vague Aryan name . Small posters , at every door , said : " Entrance forbidden to all Jews . Between 5.00 and 6.00 PAL Jews will serve Jews at gate so-and-so exclusively . " Passing the photographic department , I inquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't done any more , but they could send me the proofs anywhere I wanted , within four days . No , that would n't do , for it would n't fit in with my foolish desire to send a picture of myself , taken in front of a na ? vely painted view of Berlin , to Herr Judi , with a little dedication , such as : " ' Souvenir de voyage , " with a discreet number of five figures as signature . At lunch time 1 left the cooing duo counting their ration tickets . I haul none , and knew nothing about what could be got without them , if anything . I fought hunger with more beer , and followed Leipziger Strasse , Un ten den Linden , FranzOs ; seise Strasse , any street whose name appealed to me . My poise was now good . Every half hour , by my watch , I walked up to the nearest policeman , told him I did n't know the city , was on my way home to Antwerp on leave , and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ? At four o'clock I entered a barber shop and asked for a shave and a haircut . An hour later , passably fresh , but angry with my stupid hunger , I met Peter and Truda in the same department store , and we had a funny-tasting herb tea . They looked like honeymooners and I had a hunch that they were . How kind of them to tolerate my company . We wandered from caf ? to caf ? . Not one seemed to offer tine kind of cozy corner they wanted . Peter and Truda saw me to the station . It was a bit demolished on the side , but the black-out was complete . At 10.45 they could n't wait any longer , and decided to leave . Peter told the girl that as I was a good friend of his she ought to give me a kiss , which she did without hesitancy . " Look here , " lie said to me , " if you do n't find things the way you want , wherever you go , how about paying me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive you , and to help you , you understand ? " As I looked up , thoroughly surprised , he added , very low , in French : " Quite a joke , a German girl kissing a strange Frenchman good luck , is n't it ? " 6 THE train did n't leave until midnight . I was n't impatient any more . I 'd been late everywhere , and it had n't been for the worst . I found a compartment with plenty of soldiers in it , and asked them if they would mind a civilian . " Not at all , " they assured me . That was my chance to tell them what they should know about me . I even offered them one cigarette each , from a package of twelve that was soon as empty as it had been when I had picked it up in the office wastebasket three months ago . It had taken me all this time to fill it up , one cigarette at a time , with what the most polite overseers gave me when I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and considered very valuable presents . We joked a little . I was n't afraid of soldiers . I knew their uniforms . I had spoken to so many of them for twenty months that I was accustomed to their habits . These looked like so many others I had met ? fine boys , fond of a laugh , and relieved that no top sergeant was in sight . I saw only smiles ; heard only polite words ; comments on the latest movies ; many things sounding new to me , and happy . These Germans said " we . " There were no barbed wires around me to rouse their fear and anger . Do the barbed wires render all men on earth fierce , whether they are on one side of them or the other ? Germany , when I used to look at it from the yard , had been as unreal as a picture . Now it looked open , and so different . This compartment scene around me was fine and peaceful . I was still very tense , ready for trouble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me . If only I could eat a little . The night was going to be hard to spend . " Boys , " I told the soldiers , " I 'm feeling mighty sleepy . Will you wake me up when the controller comes ? My name 's Josef . I guess you 'll have to yell , for I 'm hard to rouse . " They laughed and I , smoothing my hair to make sure it was as flat as the picture on my passport , sank into toy turned-up collar and curled up in my corner . When they all started calling " Josef ! Josef ! " and pounding me on the hack , I jumped ? really startled . " Time to get up , Josef , " they said , as if they had known me all the time . I yawned painfully while looking at the inspector , pulled out my papers all at once , and presented them , at arm 's length , very near his face . There was everything he could want , mixed up with much he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was good . Underneath was the photograph of Adolf Hitler . Let no one tell me that that was n't very good . Third came the first page of a real passport . The photograph on the following page was not mine , but how could he tell when I was yawning , trying in vain to open my eyes , and spitting in my handkerchief ? And at the page of the visa were my permit , already identified , and Mr. G6ring 's paunch , more decorated than mine , supplemented by the smile of Mr. Rosenberg . " Police Day " said the inscription across the glorious photographs . " Good ! " said the inspector , and he gave the whole pack back to me . I went to sleep itmnedi. ately ? that is , apparently . " Good ! " sang my head , " Good ! " sang my heart , and I celebrated with my second and last sandwich . But I went to the corridor for that . I was afraid one of these soldiers might once have been a sentry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as identical with the sardines-inoil that prisoners received from the French Red Cross and that the guards coveted so much . I had been reminded early that night that the least detail counts . Had n't I given myself away as a Frenchman with a single word said to Peter in the station at Stettin ? Dear Peter ! Peter the Alsatian , who had known all the time the risk he was taking in letting me spend the night with him , and had n't even let on until the last minute ! The rest of the night cost me 2 marks 50 more . One whole hour could n't pass without a new police , - man waking everyone up in the name of the glorious police forces fighting in Russia . It was monotonous , and disquieting for many reasons . In vain did I show them the row of poisoned flowers on my coat ? they thought I needed one more swastika , and kept on shaking their metal box until another coin had been dropped inside . Since ten o'clock yesterday morning , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 3 marks NO at the barber shop ; and my capital had been reduced to a mere 60 marks . How far should I go with it ? But Cologne was n't very far away , and the border was only fifty miles beyond . Even if I were taken now , my failure would n't be ridiculous . I had crossed the better part of Germany . In Cologne I had to change trains and wait three hours . I would n't hang around the station as I did yesterday . I was n't traveling in the shadow of a German girl any more ; and the less I showed my papers , the safer it would be . I wandered in the city . It was dark at first , and foggy later . No shop seemed to be opening , and that reminded MC it was Sunday . Sunday should be a good day . Everyone should feel lazy , even the policemen ; but I felt depressed . I wanted sleep and food . My nerves were beginning to weaken after thirty-six hours of constant tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cheer up . ESCAPE THROUGH GERMANY 7 AACIIEN was famous for its police . It was the last city before the border . Every hour or so , the whole station was carefully combed . The Germans paid a higher price for the betrayal of fugitives than the latter could pay for being smuggled into Belgium . Now women and school children were constantly on the lookout for any stranger in the vicinity . Our train was unbelievably full ? mostly Belgian workers , talking loudly in either Dutch or French , and obviously going on leave . Very few of them wore Nazi insignia ; and I felt , with pleasure , that mine were not too popular . I removed the most conspicuous as discreetly as I could , but it was too early for a thorough cleaning . I engaged in conversation with a couple from Brussels . Both worked in Cologne ? he as carpenter , she as factory helper . I learned from them that this train went as far as Herbesthal , and that all inspection of passports would be done there . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had never seen such a crowd in one single train . We passed Aachen. it was time to get ready . I opened my brief case , extracted the heavy package that was in it , and put it in my pocket . Now the train ran very slowly , then stopped . " - fierbesthal " said huge letters on a low building . " Everyone out ! " yelled German employees in German , while the Belgians yelled it in French . A fence divided the platform in two , and the only opening in sight was the door of a low building marked " Passport Examination . " On the other side was Belgium . It was good to see it , if only for a line while . As everyone fought his way out of the car , I discarded the brown paper and held the object in my sleeve . It was a hammer . My idea was to entrust my overcoat , my hat , and my brief case to someone else , on the pretext of going to the toilet . Then I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and begin tapping the wheels with my hammer , as if it were my job to see that every one of them was sound . As I should be bending my head very low there was a chance that no one would notice that I had no cap on . It was worth trying . I would follow the train from wheel to wheel , to the last wagon , and then mix with the men unloading crates over there , trusting that the Germans would take me for a Belgian , and the Belgians take inc for a Gerelan . There were other trains , waiting on the Belgian tracks ; and once on their side , I would promptly disappear . So I followed the Belgian couple , to give nu countenance , for a while . They concluded that was trying to stay with them , and asked me it carry some of their luggage . They knew their way around , and in two minutes I was incorporated with them in the line before the passport office , That , however , did n't suit me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lavatory is ? " I asked the man . " They wo n't let you go there now , " answered his wife , and calling the nearest policeman , she inquired . " No , you 'll have to wait until you 're on the other side , " he informed her . I hope I did n't show that little woman how exasperated I was with her for trying to be helpful out of turn . There was no use getting out of line , now that she had attracted attention to me . The policeman would stop me , or follow . The scheme was ruined . Curses on her ! I wanted to crack her on the head with the hammer , but instead , I pretended to tie my shoe and abandoned it under my feet . And now would n't the woman stumble over it ! " Look , " she said to her husband , " someone has lost a hammer . " " You do n't , have to let everybody know . It 's a good one and has found an owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced slowly , dangerously so , and a new collection plate was passed under my nose . I dropped only a small coin in it , and the fellow was n't pleased . Ile said so . These collectors knew it was their last chance . A very tall one , well over six feet , with his cap cocked on the side , pushed to the head of the line and shouted : " Listen , everybody ! There 's a big crowd today , and you 'll have to wait a long time . Whoever will give live marks ? live marks for our heroes in Russia ? will pass right now . Who 's first ? " Twenty feet behind inc an impatient man shot out of the line , a five-mark bill in hand ; another ; three others ; and the big German thrust them inside , while calling to his colleagues : " Look , pals ! I 've collected twenty-five marks in one second . " They thought it was a good joke and laughed , but the crowd was all the more impatient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I threw my papers on the desk , exactly as I had shoved them in the inspector 's face , photos and all . At the page of the picture that should have been mine was a five-mark note . When the officer saw it , I made the gesture of taking it back and said : " Excuse Inc . " " What ? No , that wo n't do , " he said . " Give it to inc in a hurry . " " But , officer , look at my chest ! Look at all these photos ! I 've spent a week 's salary on you since yesterday . " " Come on , " he retorted , " you can well afford one more fiver ; you make a lot of good money in Germany  --  you all do . " " 2111 right , you win ! Keep the bill . " " Good boy , " he laughed . With one hand he stuck the bill in his box , and with the other he stamped my visa . He had n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Germany . This time the little woman had sa ved tne. 8 BcyoNn this office was another one , opening on the Belgian platform , and a sign saying that here one could exchange a maximum of 300 marks for Belgian or French francs , according to the passport . 1 was getting my money ready before presenting it , when a man of my own age , a little smaller , with no overcoat , and a broad cap , put two ten-mark bills in my hand and said : " I , too . Please . " I changed 70 marks in all , and received 840 Belgian francs . The other followed me in the train . I gave him his money and he laughed softly . " The worst is over , " he said . " I do n't know . Better be careful . " His coat had once been part of a Norwegian uniform . I could recognize it by the shape of the pockets and the thin little stripe around the sleeves , though he had built up a civilian collar in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His shoes were French military shoes , but he had cut off the copper clips on the sides that make them so easy to spot anywhere . " I had a coat exactly like yours , " he said , " but I 've traveled on the axles from Aachen and ruined it I had to leave it on the tracks , and I hope we 'll leave before it 's found . I was already standing on the Belgian plat form Mum you came out of the inspection room , and I spotted you on account of your British coat . I was n't sure , though , until I saw you turn towards the wall with medals on your chest , and turn again without any . " He had escaped inspection by walking openly along the tracks with a lantern he 'd taken down from a post , until he found a way out of the station . Later he had entered it from the Belgium side . He knew about the money exchange , and had waited until he saw someone he thought he could trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my freedom if any German had noticed it ; but instead , it had brought me a companion . I was not through with the couple from Brussels . The man and his wife arrived , after looking for me in the various compartments , and she addressed tee in Flemish dialect , instead of German , as before . I could n't make out what she wanted . She laughed and told me , in French , it was clear to her who I was , for she had seen my Flemish passport lying on the desk . A little reluctantly I admitted it . " I 'm so glad , " she said with a kind smile ; and her husband shook hands with me . We made friends , though I ca n't say I felt comfortable about het . Impulsive as she was , what would she do next ? The train started painfully , with much grinding of wheels and a succession of jerks ; and then we had an accident ... We were standing at the end of the corridor , when the coach behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the platform fell on the tracks . My new comrade caught the woman by the arm just in time to save her . How much the others had been hurt , we could n't tell ? they had disappeared under the wheels . With al . most enough noise to cover the shrieks , we stopped . It took half an hour for the German and Belgian policemen to get the bodies out ; and not until another half hour was the train on its way again . " You 're so pale , " said the woman . " Are you sick ? Are you afraid of blood ? " I was feeling sick , but it was n't the blood of the others , but my own luck : this magnificent luck not to have been standing a little farther on the platform , wounded ( if not killed ) , and taken to the hospital ? in other words , back ; a luck that seemed to me more incredible than anything I had gone through in the last thirty-six hours . It still seems as . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of going to a hotel . You could n't do that . without first getting a permit from the German police ; and I did n't feel strong enough to fool them once more . The couple insisted that we have a glass of beer together . We had several . Then they told its to wait an hour for them . When our friend returned , we followed him out to the house of a friend of his . This man operated a truck for the Germans and collected various products from other cities . He could take us along in the direction of the border , but would n't hear of any payment . We should walk to a given corner . He would drive by slowly , but not stop . It would he up to us to jump inside his truck unseen . If it proved impossible , he would come back a little later . We shook hands with both of them , cordially . The carpenter gave me a little package , long and heavy . My fingers recognized my hammer under new wrappings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . // The plan worked all right . We hid inside , behind a generous stack of sacks . At the south gate of Brits-gener sels , the truck stopped for inspection . We heard the driver talking , about his orders and various papers , in German . A sentry poked his head in the back and did n't see anything wrong . I was so choked then , on account of the fumes from the charcoal stove replacing petrol as fuel , that I could hardly refrain from coughing . Three hours later , after much bumping and rattling of gears , the driver tapped on the partition panel and said we were nearing Tournai . He would slow down again , and as soon as the coast was clear , we should jump out . Good luck to us ! We followed the road until we found a caf ? .. For live francs a little glass of yellow alcohol with a pretention to the taste of applejack did us good . In the next caf ? we drank beer , and waited another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we took alcohol , with no more luck . We were lighting drowsiness when the owner of the fourth place , an old woman , sat down with us and quizzed no it 1 : : tie . She could see we were French and looking for something . She was Belgian . We had nothing to fear from her . Why not tell her what our trouble was ? We did . She took us to her back room , kissed us both , and showed us the photograph of her son , who was a prisoner somewhere in Austria . We told her the details , not too disheartening , about life in the camps ? for instance , what we had to eat  - -  and it sounded reassuring to her . She had feared mach worse , but it was better than what most people got around there . She cried , all the same , and we could n't console her . To take her thoughts away from her own sorrow , we told her we had money and would pay any price for food . She put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . She came back after a good while , with two pounds of potatoes she had bought for forty francs . She fried them with a little grease she had left , and ate them with us . They tasted so good , and it was so civilized to sprinkle salt over them , out of a salt shaker , that Emile and I began to cry , too . Perhaps it was because we needed Bleep so badly and were almost drunk . At 4.00 P.M. a cousin of hers arrived , and she told him who we were and urged him to help us cross into France that night . The quicker we went the better . " Fine , " said the cousin , and we left the good mother . We boarded a streetcar going in the direction of the border only ten miles away . We left it a few stations before the end of the line , and began another wandering tour , from caf ? to cafe . Fortunately they are very close to each other on this road . Almost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupation for the wives , between washing dishes and raising sons and vegetables . We drank French wine at ten francs a glass , because it was the most . expensive drink and our only way to reward these kind people . We stayed longer in each than we wanted ; their rhythm was not so fast as ours , but we had to bow to it . They would n't let us out on the road again until someone smoking a pipe outside had said that no German was looking this way . In the last place , the owner changed what was left of our Belgian francs for French francs , which were a little cheaper . We received 700 francs between us . When dusk had fallen , we shook hands with everyone around , and the hostess kissed us good luck . " rive la France ! " she said . " 1 " ire la Belgique ! " we replied , in a very low voice , like a secret . Then she threw over her shoulders the knitted scarf that no woman between the Somme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , and endeavored to lock her chicken house while we crawled at her feet .. She disturbed her flock so conscientiously that its cackling covered the noise we made along the garden hedge . The ground was frozen , with little spots of snow , and hard on our hands . Sixty yards to go , she had said , but it seemed so much more . When at last I reached the end , I passed my head very cautiously through the hedge , at ground level , and looked around . There was a dirt road . Ten yards to the right it turned between two houses . and was stopped by a gate . Fifty yards to the left , the German patrol was tapping its boots around a little hut . Opposite us was another hedge , and behind , the gable of a small house . Emile got in position , and we both emerged at the same time , holding our shoes in our hands , and tiptoed across . The Germans did n't see or hear us , but a dog growled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall where we were now crouching ? on French soil ,
