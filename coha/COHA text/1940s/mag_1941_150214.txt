In a first novel out this week , What Makes Sammy Run ? , * Hollywood got a harpooning in just the way it argued could never be done . The evasive town had dodged shots by some expert marksmen-Novelists Aldous Huxley , John O'Hara , Nathanael West . But each seemed only to snag a loose end : the writer 's world , the cowboys of Gower Gulch , the comedy of studio pomposity , the empty splendor of its rich . <P> In spite of his 26 years , Author Budd Schulberg was well equipped to tackle the job . He was raised in Hollywood where his father , B. P. ( for Benjamin Percival ) Schulberg , has been a top producer for 20-odd years . Since graduating from Dartmouth in 1936 , he has worked off &; on as a screen writer . In a neatly organized yarn about a little Jew named Sammy Click , who soars from a $12-a-week office boy on a Manhattan daily to head of a studio before he is 30 , Budd Schulberg gathers in the stray and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a whole like a mammoth jigsaw puzzle . <P> Everything is there : the premiere which resembles a festooned church social ; the serious artists ( . . . When a moving picture is right it socks the eye and the ear and the solar plexus all at once and that is a hell of a temptation for any writer ) ; the buzzing nightclubs ; the stragglers from Pasadena ; the masculine-minded feminine population who even pay the checks ; the trade-paper racket where you buy good reviews ; the frightening bankers from New York who own the studios ; the studio commissaries full of rumors and gossip ; the little houses along the beach where the underprivileged are as comfortable as the big shots in their Bel Air mansions . Only a few of these places and people get their right names , but the impression is still there . <P> What Makes Sammy Run ? will provide plenty of lively guessing for Hollywood . For Sammy is an accumulation of several current careers , which Author Schulberg has painted with merciless accuracy . Sammy 's start in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advertising department of the paper , and larceny sponsored his success from then on . At one time , while Sammy was making $500 a week , the real author of his work was on Sammy 's payroll for $25 . Soon Sammy became a producer , eventually head of the studio after some deft back-stabbing of the people who had helped him along . <P> Author Schulberg 's principal preoccupation is with what makes a Sammy Click . He finds Hollywood full of them , although most have " all their sammyglickness covered up with Oxford manners or have-one-on-me sociability or Christian morals that they pay their respects to every Sunday morning when they do n't have too big a hangover . " In parsing Sammy , he tries to find the Glick goal and comprehend the Glick means , even returns to Sammy 's grubby childhood surroundings in Manhattan 's Rivington Street , a thickly packed Jewish section .
