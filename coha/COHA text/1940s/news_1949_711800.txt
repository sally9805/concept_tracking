txt ALBANY GOP URGES BIGGER SCHOOL AID Members in Legislature Tell Dewey They Favor $25,000,000 at Least and Taxes Needed By LEO EGAN Spectral tr rum NEW Yam Timms . ALBANY , Jan. 18 ? Republican members of the Legislature , as a result of party conferences , have informed Governor Dewey that they favor an increase of from $25,000,000 to $40,000,000 a year in state aid to education . Moreover they have told him they are ready to vote the taxes needed to finance such a rise . The increase favored by the legislators would be in addition to the $40 , - 000,000 increase in state aid due this year through the operation of the revised educational-aid formula adopted last year in the Feinberg-Becker Law . To finance the new state grants and other budget increases would require , according to present computations , an increase of 1 per cent in the corporate franchise tax , now 43y per cent , in addition to restoration of personal income tax rates to their 1941 level and the imposition of one cent a gallon more on the gasoline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant or whether it should be in the form of temporary assistance for the construction of new school buildings and the rehabilitation of old ones is still a matter of debate among // the members of the Republican majority in the two branches of the Legislature . In general , Republican members of the Senate favor a continuing grant . This would be distributed along the lines of the present formula . The Republican members of the Assembly favor temporary assistance for school construction and rehabilitation . Minimum Proposed by Assembly A resolution urging a minimum increase of $25,000,000 over the amounts required by the existing formula was adopted at a conference of Republican members of the Assembly without a dissenting vote and transmitted to the Governor by Speaker Oswald D. Heck . It did not specify how the money was to be distributed or whether it should be in the form of a continuing grant or temporary assistance . Republican Senators urged $40 , - 000,000 additional at a conference with Mr. Dewey , but have taken no formal vote on the amount . There were no dissents , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dewey 's attitude m the question will be has not been disclosed definitely but Republican legislators believe he will approve any reasonable increase on which they can agree among themselves , provided they are willing to raise the additional revenue it would require . Because of the lack of agreement among the legislators , it is regarded as certain that the Governor will make no specific recommendation on the subject in his budget . This must be submitted to the Legislature by Feb. 1 . Instead , Mr. Dewey is expected to say in his budget message that he will have a suggestion on the subject for submission later in a supplemental budget message . This procedure would have the effect of linking the amount of any increase to a specific tax measure without the necessity of earmarking the tax for educational purposes . Both Governor Dewey and John E. Burton , budget director , regard this as unsound administration . Change in Procedure This Year The initiative taken by Republican legislators this year is in marked contrast to the policy followed last year when the present formula was worked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without advance consultation with Republican members . It had been submitted to the majority leaders , however . Last year 's measure was written into law only after a bitter behind-the-scenes battle . Then a substantial number of Republican members , who thought the change provided too little in increased aid , yielded to Mr. Dewey for fear that an open break might harm his Presidential chances . Since the notification to Governor Dewey of the legislative attitude on the question , strenuous efforts have been made , without success up to now , to obtain an agreement among Republicans on the amount of new assistance and the manner in which it should be distributed . As part of this effort , eleven Republican Assemblymen from New York City have held a meeting to plan steps that would insure the granting of a fair share of any additional assistance to the city . If the distribution ratio provided by the existing formula is used , 11 New York City would get roughly 30 per cent of any additional amount . The Republican Assemblymen from the city , however , would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share . At the conference of New York ' City Republicans , held in the office of John R. Brook of Manhattan , a majority is reported to have favored earmarking the additional funds for school construction and rehabilitation . A substantial minority took the view that any extra grant should be given without any strings attached so that the city administration and the Board of Education could use it for any purpose they thought best .
