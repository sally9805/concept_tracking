MIAEF MAIN ( Mid , wine , . Wednesday . August 2. 1914- Just before lunch , I met Ike in the hall . He was all smiles . " If the intercepts are right , we are to hell and gone in Brittany and slicing ' em up in Normandy , " he said . I followed him into the office to hear more of the good news . Patton had taken command yesterday , and he had plunged ahead against little or no resistance . Later I learned that the " Phantom " arrow showed we had reached Rennes 12 hours ago . Meantime , Ike is fretting for more progress , as he " pushes on the reins . " General Marshall has requested information in order to answer questions from press and officials . Ike worked late yesterday and this morning on a detailed report of his current and future operations . Hardly had he authorized the final draft of his report to General Marshall when he returned from he war room with the exciting information that wehad broken through not only into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disorganized German forces . Ike cabled General Marshall to award Bradley something which only a Regular officer could fully appreciate  --  a permanent major generalship . Ike saw Churchill last evening for a conference on the P.M. 's presentation of war news to the House of Commons today . He read most of it to Ike  --  taking nearly an hour . Ike readily assented to Churchill 's desire to mention British officers who did the early planning of OVERLORD with an Anglo-American staff . The P.M. wanted to emphasize British participation . MIAEF Forward ISharperier Caniii ) , Friday , August 19 IA- We arrived in time for lunch yesterday . Beetle told Ike the collapse of Norway is imminent and that our Gen. Fred Morgan had been sent on a mission to Scotland to plan with the Command there on action , this being a matter heretofore left to the British Command in Scotland .

The signal says that the almost continuous attacks by flying bombs and the threat of rockets in London constitute a severe threat to Britain 's production and tend to impair her ability to continue the struggle . I asked Ike , in the car driving down to SHAEF Forward yesterday , if the Prime Minister bad " put the bee on him " in this regard , and he said " no . " Shel'burst Un Normandy ) , Monday , Augusta 7 , 19.11-1 . Today , two months after D Day , Ike set up residence in his personal camp near Trevieree .

The Supreme Commander 's regular office is in a tent , possibly twenty by thirty feet , with a board floor . Saturday , the day before yesterday , Churchill came for lunch at SHAEF Forward Camp , back in England , and practically stayed for dinner . He had started to fly to France , but his plans had been recalled owing to weather . We had expected the P. M. for dinner , but lunch was hastily arranged for his party ; the P.M. taking delight in feeding milk to the General 's black kitten , Shaef , from a saucer on the dinner table at his place . After lunch , a full-Hedged conference in the General 's office tent . Churchill said history would show that Ike had missed a great opportunity if he did n't have Dee-GOON , formerly ANVIL , shifted from the scheduled amphibious attack in the Toulon area to the ports in Brittany , notably Brest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports , where he assumed they could walk in like tourists . Ike said " no , " continued saying " no " all afternoon and ended saying " no " in every form of the English language at his " command . Ike lost the usual support of his former ally , Admiral Cunningham , who sided with Churchill , but had ardent backing from Admirals Sir Bertram Ramsay and William George Tennant . Ike 's position was that sound strategy called for making the Germans fight on as many fronts as possible . Also , there were logistical problems of the first magnitude involved in the loading and follow-up of the DRAGOON force . Ike argued so tenaciously that he was practically limp when the P. M. departed . The General observed that the Prime Minister , undoubtedly , would return to the subject in two or three days and simply regard the issue as unsettled . Meantime the British Chiefs of Staff had cabled Gen. Jumbo Wilson , Supreme Commander in the Mediterranean , to alert him of the possibility of a quick change of plans for ANVIL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This morning , General Wilson also said the idea of a change appeared most unwise . Ike had been surprised to find that his own Chief of Staff , Beetle Smith , agreed with Churchill . I told him that Admiral Tennant had taken me aside after the conference and said that Ike had been " sound 1- every step of the argument and thoroughly mag- neent . " A little later Admiral Ramsay telephoned me to add his appreciation of Ike 's stalwartness . Today 's news is good . Patton 's fingerlike thrust through Brittany with the thumb of the hand punching toward Le Mans has gone so rapidly that communications simply ca n't keep pace . Would n't it be great for Patton if his name could be printed ? I suggested release of his name to Ike , but he said , " Why should I tell the enemy ?

The P. M. is upset over Ike 's insistence for the landings in South France , still set for August 15 . Churchill knows the American chiefs defer all questions in the European Theater to General Ike . Consequently , the P. M. unlooses on Ike all his art of persuasion . The other day he went so far as to say , with considerable emotion , that he might have to go to the Monarch and " lay down the mantle of my high office . " ( CanLinaed on Page 59 ) ( Continued fr Page 23 ) Shellburst fin Normandy ) , Monday , August 11 , 9.11 . The best index of the way the battle goes is Ike 's disposition , which today is sunny , if not almost jubilant . Thinking ahead , Ike has written General Marshall about the enforced holdup of our advance , which eventually must occur while we improve maintenance facilities and prepare for a further offensive . He at first thought the Germans would try to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France . But the decisiveness of our victory west of the Seine has convinced him that we should go all-out to continue the drive beyond the German border up to the Rhine before we regroup up and refit . General Montgomery feels that if his Army Group is given practically all the maintenance available to both Americans and British , his 21st Army Group could rush right on into Berlin . This , however , would mean immobilization of all other divisions ; their transport and supplies would go largely to Montgomery . Ike thinks this impractical . In addition * * to the supply problem , Montgomery 's proposed thrust to Berlin would be on such a narrow front that German attacks on his flanks would be effective . Ike intends to hustle all his forces up against the Rhine , including those coming in from Southern France . Ike thinks if the Russians continue their pressure on the present scale , we on the western front will have to fight one more major battle . This will be to break through the German defenses , including the Siegfried Line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper , he doubts if there will be another full-dress battle . Shellburst fin Normandy ) . Tuesday , August 15. 1911 . Beetle , Admiral Ramsay and Gen. " Pug " Ismay came to dinner last evening . Before dinner , Ike told of his discussions with the Prime Minister , in which Ismay shared the good humor . Ike said at his last meeting on Friday the Prime Minister had rolled tears down his cheeks while he argued that the Americans were adopting a " bullying " attitude against the British in failing to accept their  --  meaning primarily his  --  ideas as to grand strategy . Both love the Prime , as they frequently call him , and their comment about him is like that of two admiring sons discussing a cantankerous yet adorable father . The P.M. was seeking Ike 's support for reinforcements to Alexander 's forces in Italy . Ike has always felt this is a blind alley , that nothing more than holding forces should be kept in Italy after a suitable stopping place either at the Pisa-Rimini line or in the Po River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have just heard from Lt. Gen. Alexander M. Patch , veteran of Guadalcanal , who commands the U. S. 7th Army in the southern landings . He says the operation seems successful . Shellburst ( In Normandy ) . Thursday , August 17 , 1941 . It seems the Allies were not the only ones that had weather problems on D Day . Group Captain Stagg had an interesting talk with Major Lettaw , the chief German meteorologist , who was captured by U. S. forces while on his way from Paris to Rennes . The German weatherman , whose job was to forecast for German commanders , was anxious to know how our forecast for the invasion was made and why we decided on the night of June 5/6 . Lettaw had advised his superiors that invasion after June 4 was impracticable , because of the stormy weather moving in from the Atlantic . He had told them bad weather would continue without improvement for several days after the 4th . On the basis of the German weather forecast , many officers of their divisions in Normandy were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German major said they were taken completely by surprise when the invasion started . Shellburst ( 1n Normandy ) , Friday . August 18 , 19.11 . Churchill has come around magnificently and has sent Ike a glowing message , after watching the landings in Southern France . London , Monday , August 21 , 10-14 . A news story disclosing the separation of command of American ground forces from those of the British , and placing Bradley on a par with Montgomery , each commanding an Army Group , has caused so much misunderstanding in the press on both sides of the Atlantic that Ike has asked me to join SHAEF PRO for a while and help trouble-shoot such problems as these before they arise . So I am moving to London . London , Thursday , August 31 , 1944 . Ike flew over from the continent for a heavily attended press conference yesterday afternoon . He outlined the command setup in a straightforward manner and I think has corrected the situation . He praised Monty and said that anyone who misinterpreted the transition of command as a demotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . He said Montgomery is one of the great soldiers of this or any other war and he would now have the job of handling the battles on his side of the front . It would be most unfortunate if this plan of command , which had developed as it was conceived from the start , should be interpreted as a slap at anybody . London , Wednesday . September 13. 1941 . I spent the week end at Granville with General Ike , who is confined to his bed by a wrenched knee . He is in a small villa named " Montgomery " overlooking Mont St. Michel , the ancient abbey on a rock . About a week ago , he had flown off from Granville to meet Generals Bradley and Patton . A broken muffler in his C-47 required a change of planes at Chartres for the return journey . Capt . Dick Underwood found a liaison plane and flew the General back to Granville , intending to land near Jullouville . There was a very high wind and visibility was not too good , so Underwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ike 's small villa . The landing was O.K. , but the tide was rising , and Ike helped Dick push and pull the plane to a spot that would remain dry . Ike said he wondered if this beach had been mined and , if so , if it had been de-mined . But it was n't a mine that got him ; it was a twist in the soft sand that wrenched his knee . Ike had been to Paris attending a ceremony during which a plaque of the SHAEF shield for emplacement on the Arc de Triomphe was presented to the citizens of Paris . He had laid a wreath on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier . The party drove down the Champs Rlysees , but our officers in charge of security had refused to permit a public announcement of the ceremony . But news of a parade spreads rapidly in Paris . As the party went down the street , there was a solid line of cheering faces along the Champs Elysees . Ike griped because he was riding in a closed car and the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run-ning board , held on with one hand and waved his cap with the other . This did his bad leg no good . Ike feels that for some days it has been obvious that our military force can advance al-most at will , subject only to supply . He is thinking of ad-vancing on a wide front to take advantage of all existing lines of communication . He expects to go through the Aachen gap in the north and the Metz gap in the south , and to bring the southern group of armies ? . 6th  --  to the Rhine south of Coblenz . Then he thinks he should use his airborne forces to seize crossings over the Rhine , to be in position to thrust deep into the Ruhr , and so threaten Berlin itself . Pat-ton had been forced to stand still southeast of Paris while supplies went to Monty 's group and to Hodges ' U. S. 1st Army , moving on Montgomery 's right . Ike had wanted to make certain there would be no halt in operations toward Antwerp and Brussels , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needed any improvement in supply . Ike has decided that a northern thrust toward the Ruhr under Montgomery is not to have priority over other operations at this time . Monty is fearful this will give the enemy time to organize heavier resistance ; and slower progress must be expected in his sector . Paris , Tuesday , September 19.11111 . I had a note from Ike today , written from SHAEF at Granville . Ike was hearing some repercussions from the Quebec conference , where his recommendations for continuance of the Allied command for purposes of occupation of Germany have not been accepted . Instead , Germany is to be divided into areas in which the Russians , Americans and the British are to have control on nationalistic lines . I know from previous talks that Ike has strongly favored the continuation of SHAEF for the occupation , as he believes this arrangement will simplify the executive orders from the three governments . However , his recommendation has been disapproved on the highest level . Paris , Sunday , September 2.1. 11114 . At Versailles today I found Ike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ von Rundsteclt , at St. Germain , a 15-minute drive from his headquarters . It had a large and deep air-raid shelter , which , I discovered , Ike had not even seen . Telek and Caacie , the Scotties are in fine form . Shaef , the tomcat , is still growing . Ike and I discussed comment I picked up from American and British correspondents . Ike was shocked to know of the extent of anti-British feeling by American correspondents , and was surprised when I reported a somewhat similar feeling by British writers , notably those in Montgomery 's sector . My doleful report drew forth his frequently used comment , " This world and then the fireworks . " The Quebec conference , in addition to deciding that occupation of Germany , once the war is over , would be in sectors on nationalistic lines , had removed from Ike his direct command over the RAF Bomber Command under Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Travers Harris , and the U. S. Strategic Air Force under Spaatz . Spaatz had been most disturbed by the new arrangement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written General Marshall that the personal relationship between himself , " Bomber " Harris , and Tooey Spaatz was so intimate and understanding that no real harm had been done . Ike is still authorized to call for strategic bombers for direct support of land and naval operations . But their main job is to pound enemy industry . Lt. Gen.Lewis Brereton , commanding the 1st Allied Airborne Army , reported on the 23rd that there had been no news of the British 1st Airborne Division at Arnhem for 36 hours . The division is in a tight perimeter and the enemy is throwing mortar shells and heavy machine-gun fire , followed by counterattacks , into the British paratroopers . To be saved , they must have relief within 24 hours . I told Ike that there was some griping that two American airborne divisions had been assigned to Monty , when their use might have greatly speeded Patton in his wild dash . Ike said from a military standpoint the assignment was perfectly proper . As a matter of fact , he pointed out , the British had voluntarily insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assignment . Ike finds that Bradley 's forces are getting fearfully stretched south of Aachen and that we may get a nasty little " Kasserine " if the enemy chooses the right place to concentrate his strength . Paris , Sunday , Oeiober 1 , 1044 . During the week Ike has been up forward , primarily to inform all commanders of the role they and their troops are playing at present in major strategy . Their role is largely static until we have achieved a satisfactory supply build-up . The British 1st Airborne Division has lost its bridgehead at Arnhem  --  out of 7500 paratroopers who landed , only 2000 escaped . They had nine days of unrelenting mortar , machine-gunning , artillery , rocket and small-arms fire from the Germans -- not to mention tanks and self-propelled artillery . Although militarily classified as a failure , the action and tenacity of the British constitute a brilliant page in their history . Ike was damning his old enemy , the weather . We drew a parallel between his military situation now and that of Christmas , 1942 , and the subsequent period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ike strongly upholds his strategy of stretch-out of the Germans . They have a tremendously long front in the east , a considerable one in Italy and one of about 500 miles in the west . As to intentions , Ike 's plans remain unaltered  --  that is , to press on with all speed to destroy the German armed forces and to advance deep into Germany . He has not deviated from his opinion that the best means of destroying the Germans is to strike at the Ruhr and the Saar , throwing the great weight north of the Ruhr . General Devers ' southern group , consisting of Patch 's 7th and the French let Armies , having a separate line of communications , can continue offensive operations without diversion of supplies . It is directed toward Mulhouse and Strasbourg . Paris , Friday , October 0 , 1944 . General Marshall , former Justice James F. Byrnes , now Director of War Mobilization , Lt. Gen. Tom Handy , Maj. Gen. " Pinky " Craig and Col. Frank McCarthy arrived at Orly airport in a C-54 ? called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of President Roosevelt . They flew nonstop from Newfoundland , the first publicized flight direct to Paris . General Ike soon was in animated conver-sation with General Marshall . General Bradley and Beetle also were there . General Marshall is to stay at Ike 's house , but first , Ike , Marshall and McCarthy are flying with General Bradley to his headquarters . Paris , Saturday , October 7 , 10144 . Capt . Frank Mayborn had a small dinner at the Chatham to wet my fourth stripe . Lt. Col. V. E. Scott-Bailey , of the British Army , stood on his head . Today I took Mayborn and Scott-Bailey to Versailles . I was surprised to find Ike posing for Cathleen Mann , the marchioness of Queensberry . He greeted all of us mast cordially , as usual , and he was especially pleased to see Scott , for whom he has a high regard . The marchioness said she was sorry we had interrupted her work ; that the serious expression on the General 's face had now been changed . Ike said , " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But , " said the marchioness , " they 're spoiling your face . " I knew he hated to sit for a picture . He had done it only once before , in Algiers . The thought of having to spend 15 minutes a day for seven days had ruined an equivalent number of breakfasts . Paris , Saturday , October 14. 1941 . I drove out to Versailles today . General Ike had departed with General Bradley and Col. Jimmy Gault for the headquarters of Hodges ' . 1st Army at Liege . Ike was to meet tlaG , King , on an official but secret , visit . . At Headquarters there was an information copy for General Ike from General Marshall of a cable from the Prime Minister to the President . On his way to Moscow , Churchill had spent several hours at Naples discussing the Italian campaign with Generals Wilson and Alexander . He was much distressed by their story . The fighting in Italy has been hard , losses have been heavy , the men are tired and there are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much strength was taken from the Italian front for the invasion of Southern France that complete victory would be denied in Italy unless fresh troops were thrown in . He feared also that Hitler might be able to withdraw German troops from Italy and ns ' them elsewhere . The Prime Minister was inquiring if two or possibly three American divisions might be allotted to General Clark 's 5th Army , General Marshall had also sent to General Ike the President 's reply that he and the Joint Chiefs of Staff agreed that none of Ike 's divisions in France should be diverted to Italy , because additional U. S. forces in Italy would not affect that campaign this year . Paris , Friday , Oetober 20 , 1944 . Ike lunched with the King at headquarters of Hodges ' 1st Army at Liege . Lip front , Ike found that the one thing worrying everybody is the shortage of artillery Ammunition . The shortage was not caused merely by port capacity , but by too few shipments from the U. S. He cabled General Marshall and asked if anything could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1044 , Had a session with Ike in his office and went on to lunch with him . He is looking fine , except for a touch of conjunctivitis in his left eye . I gave him a " fill-in " on my recent trip around the forward press camps , and remarked that each camp is something of a claque for its general . I found there had been an exchange of messages between General Marshall and Ike relative to speeding the flow of infantry regiments . Among the aids for an all-out clean-up of the war before 1945 would be the release for general use of a new fuse for artillery shells , called VT . This fuse automatically detonates the projectile when it comes in . proximity of the earth and may be set for various distances  --  an important development . A shell that explodes above the ground throwing fragments into foxholes is more effective than those which burst on contact with the ground . Ike is prepared to wage a final all-out battle to cross the Rhine if we have the assurance of supply that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River to permit entry to that port is the first and most immediate objective . After the President had declined to divert American divisions from France to help Generals Alexander and Clark in Italy , General Ike responded to an urgent request of Alex by agreeing to send him 3000 replacements . For this , Alex was extremely grateful , and wrote an unusually warm letter . Of immediate concern , however , to General Ike were the complaints and discontent of American wounded who are returning to the U. S. Ike immediately assigned a small group of competent officers and enlisted men , all of them carrying wounds from this war , to vita hospitals , rehabilitation centers and replacement depots in France and England to determine the cause of the complaints . ( continued on Page 62 ) ( Confirmed front Page 60 ) Purim , Friday , November 3. 1011 . I was out at Ike 's office today when the good news came in from Monty that the approaches to Antwerp and the Scheldt Estuary are now completely free from enemy interference . Ike immediately expressed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his congratulations to General Crerar and his 1st Canadian Army . I have seen Ike several times when he has received good news which he normally has discounted in advance , but on this occasion he could not hide his elation , for on the capture of Antwerp depended all of his future plans to end the war . Purim . Monday . November 1:1. 111 Ike is at his camp near Reims and tomorrow the Prime Minister is to visit him . Ike has been visiting troops up front , gathering firsthand information on the replacement problem  --  particularly that of permitting soldiers whose wounds had healed and who were capable of combat again to return to their own divisions after hospitalization . He felt any wounded man who wanted to rejoin his own outfit should not only be permitted but encouraged to do so . Wednesday . November 15 . HP lt . Churchill arrived in the French presidential train at Reims , where he was met by French authorities and Ike , who took him and his party to the camp near Reims . There were Field Marshal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's daughter , Mary Churchill , John Martin , his private secretary , Capt . Charles Worth and our old friend , Comdr . " Tommy " Thompson . The Prime Minister looked well , and made himself comfortable in General Ike 's caravan , a new one recently provided by General Spaatz . The Prime Minister discussed with Ike anticipated changes of command which he and the President were considering . One involves Italy . Late in the afternoon , Churchill flew back to England with his party . PorM.M111.11111. - ay . November 20 , 19414 . General Ike is extremely well satisfied with his travels . Following visits to the headquarters of all the divisions and corps of 1st and 9th armies , he spent considerable time with General Patton and the 3rd Army units . I mentioned to Ike again that he should feel satisfied that his judgment had been vindicated with regard to General Patton , who has become America 's most colorful and highly publicized general from this theater . Ike said be had chuckled at Patton at luncheon for the King at Li  --  ge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him how frequently he used his famous pearl-handled revolvers , " I personally have killed thirty Germans . " " How many ? " said Ike . Patton replied , " Five . " Ike said he thought the abominable weather was a secret weapon of Hitler , and paced the living room , pausing now and then to look out the window to judge the weather . Pavia .. Monday , November 27. 1044 . There is much high-level consideration given to the issuance of a joint statement by the President and the Prime Minister which might break the will of the Germans to continue to resist . But the conclusion finally was reached , on recommendation of the Supreme Commander , that no such proclamation should be issued at this time . Ike cabled General Marshall that any such statement preferably should follow some successful military operation . He felt the statement at this moment probably would be interpreted as a sign of weakness rather than an honest statement of intent . The Prime Minister had cabled the President that if he were a German soldier he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battle for Cologne is at its peak , as a sign of weakness on our part and as positive proof of the advantages of continued desperate opposition . In any event , the Russians should be parties to any proclamation , as they are holding on their front double the number of divisions which oppose us . In addition , Stalin is considering , after the war , taking several million Nazi youth , Gestapo men , and so on , for prolonged work to repair German damage to Russia . Churchill felt that it is difficult to say that Stalin 's attitude on this is incorrect . Consequently , neither the President nor the Prime Minister could give any assurances to the Germans without consultation with Stalin as to the postwar employment of German labor . Churchill reminded the President that the Germans are afraid of occupation by the Russians and fear that a sizable proportion of their population will be transported to Russia  --  or as they put it , Siberia  --  to toil to death . There seemed , to Churchill , that nothing could be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Germans . Paris . Tuesday . December 5. 111.14 . I spoke to General Ike today about doing a Christmas newsreel for the troops . We agreed and our sound crew will go to his camp at Reims to make the film next Saturday . Ike said he had been rubbing his lucky coins hard lately . One thing that was bothering him was that , although a great deal depends upon the date and scale of the anticipated winter offensive of the Russians , actually he knows nothing definite of their plans . Newly formed German divisions are arriving on our front ; we have attracted several divisions directly from Austria and East Prussia . Ike 's problem is to continue his attacks as long as the results are so much in our favor , but , at the same time , to prepare a full-out and heavy offensive when weather conditions become favorable . Ike sees no real evidence of trouble developing within Germany , and expects the Germans to maintain a strong defense for some time , assisted by weather , floods and muddy ground . Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim Gault , Ike 's British aide , phoned me from Shellburst , the camp near Reims , to discuss a story written by the Stars and Stripes pool reporter who had covered the conference and luncheon of 17 congressmen with General Ike during the day . Some of the congressmen had brought presents  --  one , a jar of pork sausage , another a box of hominy and still another a bottle of Kentucky bourbon . Jim was apprehensive that the bourbon might cause a bad reaction in America . I did n't think so , but told him I would call the censor at the Scribe Hotel and have the story read to me . Knowing that General Ike has heretofore given similar gifts to hospitals , for the wounded , I asked the censor to write in the story , and I would take responsibility for it , that " General Eisenhower sent the whisky to a near-by field hospital .

I still could n't see why he was so concerned . " What did happen to the whisky ? " I asked . " Why , dammit , the congressmen drank it before lunch , " he replied . Paris . Wednesday . December 13. 1941 . In a letter from Monty to " My dear Ike , " dated November 30 , the Field Marshal stated we had definitely failed to implement the plan contained in the SHAEF directive of October 28 . This directive ordered the main effort to be made in the north to defeat the enemy west of the Rhine , to gain bridgeheads over the Rhine and the Ijssel rivers and to deploy in strength east of the Rhine preparatory to seizing the Ruhr . Monty said we had achieved none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered a strategic reverse . Monty said we needed a new plan , and this time we must not fail . He reasoned that the front divided itself naturally into two main sectors , one north of the Ardennes , the other south . He wants one commander in full operational control in the north and another south . He had suggested to Ike that there be a ground-force commander to work under the Supreme Commander and to run the land battle for him . But General Ike had rejected this idea as not suitable . Monty went on that Bradley and he had made a good team , had worked together in Normandy under General Ike and had won a great victory , but that things had not been so good since the Supreme Commander made them of equal importance . Monty 's letter made Ike hot under the collar . He replied promptly that he did n't know what Monty meant by strategic reverse ; as far as he was concerned , he realized that we had failed to achieve all that had been hoped , but hopes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the plans are made . He said the Ruhr is important , but we should not lose sight of the primary objective , which is to defeat the German forces that are barring our way into Germany . General Ike did not agree that more strength could have been thrown to Monty in the north than was actually maintained there during early September . The Supreme Commander said , after all , we had gained a great victory in Normandy . Bradley 's brilliant break-through made possible the rapid exploitation by all forces which had cleared France and Belgium and had almost carried us across the Rhine . General Ike declared he had no intention of stopping Devers ' and Bradley 's operations as long as they are cleaning up our right flank and giving us what he described as " capability of concentration . " He did not , on the other hand , plan to push these attacks senselessly . He told Montgomery that he appreciated the frankness of his statements and the usual friendly way in which they were put , but he begged him not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting force as a failure merely because we have not achieved all that we could have hoped . As usual , his salutation had been " Dear Monty " and his signature , " Ike . " The British Field Marshal responded in a letter dated December 2 , saying he was disturbed by General Ike 's request that Monty " not continue to look upon the past performances of this great fighting force as a failure . " Monty said he had never done anything of the sort and had never said anything which could convey that impression . He had written about the SHAEF directive of October 28 , which Monty declared we had failed to carry out . The Supreme Commander immediately replied to the Field Marshal and tendered his prompt and abject apologies for misreading Monty 's letter of November 30th . Ike said that in his haste to answer , he had read into Monty 's letter a far more pessimistic statement than was justified . General Ike was sorry if his letter gave offense , and certainly did not want to give an erroneous meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their close relationship . Paris , Tbursday.December 11.11141 . General Ike , had flown from his Advance C. P. for conferences in London , where lie saw the Prime Minister , Admiral Stark and Ambassador Winant . The conference with the Prime Minister was a long one , and he also met with the British Chiefs of Staff . That evening Ike dined with the Prime Minister and flew back to Versailles on Wednesday . Following his return , he wrote to General Marshall that the British seemed disturbed by dispersion of our strength during the past week . Ike explained that flooded conditions in the lower Rhine Valley prevented further offensive action in that region at the moment , and that we had supported Montgomery 's northern thrust with everything we could possibly maintain . The Supreme Commander also explained to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff that in the planned attack toward Bonn and Cologne , General Bradley had used all the divisions he could possibly employ on that narrow front .
