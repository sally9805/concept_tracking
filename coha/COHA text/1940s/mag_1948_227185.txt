The United Press was first , and almost right , with this week 's first big news story . At 5:12 p.m . ( E.S.T. ) last Sunday U.P . flashed a bulletin from London that " a girl baby was born to Princess Elizabeth tonight . " Within two minutes International News Service and the Associated Press flashed : " It 's a boy . " The U.P . reconsidered . In a 5:15 bulletin it said : " Uphold meaning hold up bulletin on Elizabeth 's daughter . " Then a 5:16 bulletin got it right . The U.P . ' s explanation to editors : its London bureau had flashed the news simultaneously by wireless and cable . In the wireless version , which got to the New York desk first , a bemused General Post Office telegrapher somehow wrote " girl " instead of " boy . "
