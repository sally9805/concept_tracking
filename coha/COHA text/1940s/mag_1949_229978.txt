Traffic was thick on Paris ' imposing Champs Elyses . A sleek Cadillac bearing U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson swung around the Rond-Point , headed for the French Foreign Ministry on the Quai d'Orsay . Round the other side , headed in the opposite direction , sped a Citron bearing French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman . The Frenchman 's chauffeur slammed on his brakes as another Citron , with Belgium 's Paul-Henri Spaak inside , cut across his bow . A stately Rolls-Royce carrying Britain 's Ernest Bevin slid in behind Schuman 's car . Stalled motorists along the avenue furiously honked their horns . For a breathless moment it looked to fascinated Paris pedestrians as if the four diplomatic cars would become the center of a hopeless traffic jam . But unruffled cops blew their shrill whistles , waved their white batons and the traffic flowed again , as if by magic . <P> The Foreign Ministers of the U.S. , Britain and France last week met in Paris to try to untangle a political and economic traffic jam that was seriously impeding the progress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cops to help . <P> Needed : Definition . At the core of the European jam was Germany . The Western powers had never really agreed among themselves on a policy toward the new West German Republic . Within the loose framework of the occupation statute ( TIME , April 18 ) , they floundered between a policy that would build up West Germany as soon as possible ( which by &; large is the U.S. aim ) ; and a suspicious policy of keeping West Germany 's sovereignty and industrial potential in stringent check ( which is the French aim ) . Western policy needed new , sharp definition , particularly since the Red puppet state in East Germany was relentlessly wooing Germans in the name of national unity . It was Ernie Bevin who had finally insisted that the ministers get together and do something ; he was particularly concerned over continued dismantling of German industry , on which the French have insisted all along . <P> The U.S. agreed that dismantling ought to stop . The French disagreed , although they were being more openminded about the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abide by security controls , the French were willing to let them have an annual steel production of 11,500,000 tons . It was not clear , however , just what the French meant by " security . " <P> Coca-Colonized ? As the Foreign Ministers continued their talks in the Parrot Room of the French Foreign Ministry , Schuman grew increasingly nervous . With a foreign policy debate scheduled in the French Assembly next week which could easily topple France 's shaky cabinet , he kept Premier Bidault constantly informed of the trend of talk at the Quai d'Orsay , and once Acheson and Bevin had to wait while Schuman rushed off to brief an emergency cabinet session . The Reds promptly set up a howl that Schuman was selling France down the Rhine . The Communist L'Humanit gibed : " Serons ! nous cocacoloniss ? Will we be Coca-Colonized ? . "
