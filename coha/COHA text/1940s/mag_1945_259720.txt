Tall , auburn-haired Dorothy Shaver began her career with rag dolls . Last week , from her $75,000-a-year job , she went to greater riches . She was elected the first woman president of Fifth Avenue 's smart Lord &; Taylor , to succeed Walter Hoving , president . <P> Her success was due to a personality of opposites . Her father 's family of lawyers gave her a tough masculine mind ; her mother 's family of artists a highly feminine creative touch . In her 22 years at Lord &; Taylor 's she used them both to advantage . Under the team of Hoving &; Shaver , Lord &; Taylor became one of the nation 's swank stores . And Dorothy Shaver became one of Manhattan 's top purveyors of fashion . <P> The Little Shavers . She had a backwoods start . Born in 1897 in Center Point , Ark. , she was saved ( " fortuitously " ) from an elopement at 18 , whisked off to the University of Arkansas . At the University of Chicago , she studied art with her sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York . One day Dorothy suggested to Elsie that she design a doll , for commercial sale . " It might make us a fortune , " she thought . Elsie produced five fanciful little creatures , which they called the Five Little Shavers . <P> Lord &; Taylor heard about it and sent four strapping men to see the Five Little Shavers . Impressed , they took the dolls back to Lord &; Taylor , and the public took to the dolls . Sentimental women fondly carried them around under their arms as mascots . <P> Then the sisters opened a shop , Elsie designing , Dorothy managing . Impressed again , Lord &; Taylor reached out for Dorothy , put her in charge of its Comparative Shopping Bureau . She reorganized it top &; bottom , got rid of the dingy " spy system , " put in a Bureau of Stylists to help buyers and improve merchandising . Most of all she plugged fashion , at first that of Paris ( she staged the first exhibit in America of modern French decorative art ) . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American fashion and design . <P> The Big Shaver . For the most part she has created her own jobs . In quick succession , she was appointed to the Board of Directors , made vice president , then first V.P. in charge of displays , merchandising , public relations . <P> As a career woman , Dorothy Shaver professes to believe that every woman should marry eventually . But she prefers to remain wedded to her work , takes time out only for such things as the New Year 's Egg Nog party for employes in Lord &; Taylor 's executive offices ( see cut ) . <P> Last week , as retiring Walter Hoving prepared to undertake what he mysteriously described as " an amalgamation of department stores and other retail properties " outside New York , Lord &; Taylor announced that plans would go forward for expansion inside the city limits . It will open ten branches in outlying metropolitan districts , a new uptown Fifth Avenue store , close to Rockefeller Center and Best &; Co. ' s new store . In carrying out this expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buren Sims , first vice president . What Dorothy Shaver 's uptown store will look like , no outsider knows . But New Yorkers will expect a fashion treat .
