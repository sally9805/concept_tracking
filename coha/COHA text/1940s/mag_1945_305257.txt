This week Britain reached a major milestone in its educational history . On April 1 " the greatest Education Act ever known in these islands " went into effect : 1 ) it raises the period of compulsory school attendance , eventually , to age 16 fulltime , part-time to 18 ; 2 ) it provides the widest choice of curricula for all ; 3 ) it sets up almost extravagant standards for new school buildings-of which there will be hundreds . <P> When Minister of Education Richard Austin Butler started to lay his plans shortly after the Act was passed last year , he ran smack into the fact that Britain 's teacher shortage is worse than the U.S. 's . The number of teachers in publicly supported schools has dwindled from a peacetime 200,000 to 178,000 . For the new program , some 270,000 will be needed . <P> Minister Butler found a radical solution . Three emergency teachers ' colleges are scheduled to open this month , to be followed by an additional 57 . The carefully selected students ( ex-service personnel , aged 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one year of training , but will get two more years of training-on-the-job . These colleges , each designed for 200 to 300 students , already have thousands of applicants . <P> Because of the war , the school housing problem will take much longer to solve . But in their hit-or-miss way , enemy bombers did Britain a great service in destroying more than 500 of its older schools , badly damaging hundreds more , and prompting the condemnation of 699 others . Under the provisions of the Act , these ruins will be replaced and augmented by bright , shiny buildings that will include dining rooms , medical dispensaries , film projection rooms , sites away from traffic and other buildings , and ( in nursery schools ) perambulator sheds and " a place for children to dig . " <P> The framers of the Act also remembered another critical point : that before it gets as good schooling as it wants , Britain , like the U.S. , must raise teachers ' pay . ( In Peterborough , England , a school advertised in the local paper recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college degree . Salaries offered : for the teacher , 150 a year ; for the cook , 150-180 . ) Beginning this week , public-school teachers of all grades will get a fat raise .
