txt Topics of The Times Establishment of an Palace outpost of the U.S.S.R. of in Park Avenue invites the Soviets a number of reflections . The very existence of that broad thoroughfare north of the Grand Central Station where a great . tower with a glittering gold crown stands as a double gateway to Multimillionaires Row is a monument to capitalistic enterprise . For it rests on a deck above the tracks of the New York Central and New Haven railways and it is , in fact , the New York Central which has transformed an ugly cut two miles long into a parkway rated the most expensive street in the world , and lined with the tallest buildings ? by average skyline measurement ? north of the citadel of finance down in the vicinity of Wall Street . Moreover , the repBeneficiaries resentatives among us of of the dictatorship of Capitalism the proletariat have selected a palace with thirty-two rooms and twelve baths in the part of the avenue which , about the time the first World War was over , was devoted , not to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage set today , but to the overflow from Fifth Avenue of the great town houses which expressed the aspiration for better living of the rugged individualists who were first chop beneficiaries of the capitalistic system  --  to put it in plain non-Marxian language , they were the eminent exemplars of that American enterprise which has made this country , not only one in which some men achieve great riches , but one in which the standard of living of the great majority was the highest in the world  --  even before another world war reduced so much of the rest of the world to a state of lamentable substandard existence . As it happens , the block Giving in which the mansion presPlace ently to serve the Soviets to New stands is the only one in that part of the avenue still wholly occupied by private houses , and on the next corner above is the gray stone palace of the late Arthur Curtiss James , now harboring the James Institute , while , until recently , the rest of that block was occupied by another palace built for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Metropolitan Museum , of which he had long been president . The site is now a very large hole in the ground  --  evidence of a new tall building in prospect . Our Soviet friends will Contrast look right across at HuntAcross er College , in very modern the Way dress with a lot of metal and glass . In handy reach will be the Union Club wearing a chaste and dignified Renaissance number , and illustrating a contrast which from now on we are likely more and more often to encounter in Park Avenue . For the phase of the glory of the avenue which the Percy Pyne mansion represents in an especially handsome manner ? it is done in a Georgian combination of red brick and stone trim ? is on its way out . Modern conditions of living have done in the great private mansions which required a large staff of what used to be called servants . It will not be forA Place gotten that when the in U.S.S.R. was looking the Country for a country place a while ago the one selected was that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all our capitalists , out at Glen Cove on Long Island . And the same situation existed there . The great house was no longer of practical use to the capitalists who had built it with high hopes that the old order would continue . If we reflect at this point , the Kremlin , where Premier and Generalissimo Stalin resides , is no longer of any use to the Romanoffs . But it is not , perhaps , unworthy of note that the champions of the proletariat are no way different from Americans who have got up in the world or from the men anywhere in history who have got to the top . They like to set themselves up in piles of masonry which proclaim a certain splendor in the style of living . And thus they pay the sincerest flattery to the instinct for aping the ways of the aristocracy which the capitalistic system has enabled successful men to gratify even in a country as devoted to the ideal of democracy as our own . After all , it was Thomas Jefferson who leveled off the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine house from which he could enjoy a wide prospect and look down on all his neighbors.
