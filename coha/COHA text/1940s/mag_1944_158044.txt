Bolivia last week had a kidnapping and a Presidential election . Of the two , the kidnapping stirred up the bigger sensation . <P> In broad daylight , fabulously rich Mauricio Hochschild , most political of Bolivia 's three great tin magnates , got into a car with Adolfo Blum , his general mani ager . They drove to the Chilean Embassy in a suburb of La Paz to get a visa so Hochschild could go to Chile . Then they vanished , leaving only an empty car and an echoing mystery . <P> Wild rumors flew round Bolivia : Don Mauricio was in New York , was dead , was held by enemies . His tin company offered a reward of one million bolivianos ( $23,000 ) , but no news came of his whereabouts . One theory : Hochschild was murdered or kidnapped by friends of Labor Leader Jos Antonio Arze , his longtime enemy and short-time political ally , who was shot and nearly killed a few weeks ago . Another : Bolivian nationalists , who hate the big tin interests , resented the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attempted revolution ) , and giving him permission to leave the country . <P> During the excitement , the Bolivian Congress met as an Electoral College . After some tense maneuvering , it promoted Provisional President Gualberto Villarroel to legal President . The relation between the election and Hochschild 's disappearence , though rumored , did not leak out through tight Bolivian censorship .
