DEFEAT AND Tim IT WAS in October , 1902 , not long before his thirty-third birthday , that Edwin Arlington Robinson 's third hook of poems appeared . He counted on it to rescue him from the furnished room on West Twenty-third Street , in Manhattan , where lie lived in fear of meeting his landlord . Ins first book , or rather pamphlet , had been printed at his own expense in 1896 , when he was still in Gardiner , Maine , the " Tillbury Town " of his poems . The second , called The Children of the Night , had been issued in 1897 by a " vanity publisher " who charged his authors for the privilege of having their work appear between stiff covers . Robinson was by then nearly penniless , the small family fortune having trickled away in speculations by an older brother , and one ofthe the poet 's Harvard friends paid for the edition of 550 copies . This third book , too , was being paid for by friends , but they had persuaded the respected house of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure its favorable reception . Presentation copies would be sent to famous writers of the day . Various Harvard professors would be asked to review the book and it would be priced at $1 to encourage a wide sale . The author of the book was a big-framed , lean young man with a high , narrow forehead , a luxuriant brown mustache and glowing brown eyes behind his spectacles . He was shy and almost speechless in company until he had taken half a dozen drinks and could say , " Now I 'm up where you people are . " Drunk or sober he had a sense of his incapacity for practical work . " If I could have done anything else on God 's green earth , " he told a friend , never would have written poetry . There was nothing else I could do , and I had to justify my existence . " He had spent years on the new book , with special attention to the title poem , " Captain Craig , " the longest , most defiant work he had so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mischief it described the death of I pauper who was more to be admired than all the rich men of Tillbury Town . Emery Neff has the right phrase for it , in his new book on Robinson , when he calls it " a twofold assault upon conventional conceptions of beauty and conventional ideals of success . " For the time when it was written , Robinson himself was not exaggerating when he called the poem " revolutionary . " But his revolution was like one of *se Central American plots that end with a few shots fired and some junior lieutenants in the guardhouse . The book appeared and nothing in the literary world was changed . The favorable reviews by Harvard professors were never written or never published , crept for Trumbull Sickney 's friendly fines in the Harvard Monthly , which appeared after a long delay . Most of the other reviews were short as well as belated ; the longer ones attacked the book as a symbol of " the dangers to which poetry is exposed at present . " " Worse than Browning . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the famous ' , 0et Bliss Carman . Then silence fell . it was as if Robinson and his friends had painfully rolled a boulder to the tdge of the Grand Canyon , pushed it rarer and waited breathlessly . After a chile there was the echo of a pebble- : . zed splash far below and then they were alone in the desert . The desert for Robinson was the fourth-story room where he sat in a ' i &ety; chair always facing the door , as if he expected someone to appear ' ad change his life . Creaking back and forth the chair complained for him ; the poet said nothing . He was tired of tending contributions to the magazines , 27 which accepted very few of his poems and had n't paid for one since 1895 . He was tired of borrowing money from his friends . He had to refuse dinner invitations because his clothes were too shabby ; often he ate his meals at the free-lunch counters of the neighborhood saloons , where he could load his plate wtih pig 's feet after buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once when he was eating alone at the Old I Iomestead , on Ninth Avenue , the waiter offered to lend him $2 . Although he was willing to undergo hardships in order to write poetry , he was now so discouraged that the poems refused to be written . Finally a friend almost as poor as himself offered to find him a job and he went to work as timekeeper for a subway construction gang , at 20 cents an hour for a 10-hour day . He was sharing in the general defeat of all the serious writers who had come forward during the 1890 's . Dreiser , for example , went through similar experiences at exactly the same time . Disheartened by the failure of his first novel , Sister Carrie , and by the refusal of magazine editors to print his work , he sat brooding in a furnished room like Robinson 's and wondered whether he should n't commit suicide . His brother rescued him and sent him to a sanitarium . There he was told that he should spend his days outdoors until his full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad construction gang for $1.20 a day . Among the novelists of his time who had tried to write about American life in a Naturalistic fashion , Dreiser was the only one to survive into another era . The others had either died prematurely , like Harold Frederic , Stephen Crane and Frank Norris , or else they had gone over to the enemy like Hamlin Garland , who had been the prophet of a new American literature and who by 1900 was writing Western romances to be read in porch swings . Robinson was to be almost the only survivor among the poets and eventually he became the lonely spokesman for a generation that had vanished . When he attended Harvard as a special student , from 1891 to 1893 , the poets there had been a brilliant band which Robinson envied from a distance . Some of the names were William Vaughn Moody , Philip Savage , Hugh McCulloch , Trumbull Stickney and Cabot Lodge . Santayana , another ' survivor , said of them when they were gone , " All these friends of mine , Stickney especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed by the lack of air to breathe . People were very kind and appreciative to them , as they were to me , but the system was deadly and they had n't any alternative tradition ( as I had ) to fall back upon ; and , of course , they had n't the strength of a great intellectual hero who can stand . alone . " Robinson would have been angry if anyone had called him an intellectual hero , but he had a single-minded devotion to poetry that was lacking in most of the others , besides a stubborn capacity to endure . If asked what he did during the bleak years for American literature after 1902 , he might have given the same answer that Abbe Sieyes gave when asked what he had done during the Reign of Terror : " I lived . " He lived without writing much verse , but also without betraying his ideals . During the eight months that he worked in the subway he went underground , literally , as serious American writing had figuratively gone underground . He emerged slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun . The story of his reappearance begins in1904 at Groton , where Kermit Roosevelt was then a student ; he asked one of his instructors for a good book to read . The instructor , who had known the Robinsons in Maine , suggested The Children of the Night . Kermit was so impressed by it that he ordered several copies from the publisher and sent one of them to his father in the White House . The President was equally impressed ; he read some of Robinson 's poems aloud at a cabinet meeting and carried the book along with him on his campaign tour that fall . " What shall we do with Robinson ? " he asked the editor of the Century Magazine , who had come to interview him for an article on " The Presiddnt as a Reader . " The editor suggested a post in the consular service , but Roosevelt did n't believe that poets should live abroad . In June , 1905 , - he made Robinson a " special agent " in the New York Custom House at a salary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend his time writing poetry . It was one of the very few occasions ? Hawthorne 's appointment as consul at Liverpool was another ? on which an American President has come to the aid of a talented man of . letters . Still the poetry refused to be written . Robinson was recovering very slowly from the failure of Captain Craig and he was spending more time in " shopping " ? as he called his nightly tour of the neighborhood saloons ? than he was at his writing table . It was n't until he lost his post in the Custom House , at the beginning of the Taft adminis ? tration , that he gathered up courage to write a new book . The Town Down the River , as he called this group of poems about New York , was more conventional than his early verse and was more favorably reviewed . It was published by Scribner 's in 1910 , the same year that Sister Carrie was reissued by Harpers . Dreiser and Robinson had never met , but they emerged from obscurity together after suffering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1912 Robinson played no direct part ; he was bored by the arguments and out of sympathy with many aims of the younger poets . " Do you write free verse ? " a stranger asked him and Robinson answered , " No , I write badly enough as it is . " He owed a debt , however , to the crusaders for free verse and especially to Amy Lowell , who greatly admired his work . As a result of their campaigns the magazines were printing more poems , including Rubinson 's , and the public was buying more of his books . His prospects seemed so encouraging that he stopped drinking after a long struggle , during which be told his friend Ridgely Torrence that he felt like " scratching down the stars . " He also abandoned the attempt to write plays and novels on which he had wasted three years ; once more he gave all his time to verse . By 1920 the younger poets regarded him as a figure to be revered from a distance . He had two distinctions in their eyes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , he had devoted more time to poetry than any other American and had become the finest verse technician writing in the English language , with few rivals in France or Germany . But the second distinction seemed more important : Robinson was then the only American poet who had achieved not merely success but- an integrated career and one that was marked by complete absorption in his att . For poetry he had sacrificed everything else : marriage , home , the respect of his neighbors and the hope of rising in the world . Poetry was his vocation , his avocation and , such as it was , his livelihood , for he lived without teaching or book-reviewing or lecturing or reading from his books ; he simply worked and expected to be fed like Elijah by the ravens . Actually it was his friends who fed him after he lost his post in the Custom House . They were not too rich themselves , but they clubbed together and , beginning in 1916 , they gave him an income of $1,200 a year , sometimes increased by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a junior instructor in a small college . Not until 1922 , when he was 53 years old and had published his Collected Poems , did he become completely self-supporting . The gifts he received before that time did n't wound his Yankee pride because he felt that they were being given , not to him as a person , but through him to poetry . Having taken vows of poverty , chastity and obedience to his art , he could accept charity as if he were a whole monastic order . But he pale " a price for his defeats and renunciations , in his work as in his life . After the failure of Captain Craig he never again displayed the resilience and high spirits of that volume . His humor became a subdued irony and he lost his eagerness for making experiments . What was worse , he seems to have lost most of his intellectual curiosity . He continued to admire the authors he had first read at Harvard in 1891-93 and he showed to interest in the new ideas that were sweeping over the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the company he preferred was that of his close friends or disciples . He traveled only from New York City to New England and back again . He never saw the South or the West , and it was not until 1923 that he made his first trip across the Atlantic , It lasted three months and he came hack without crossing the Channel , a Ellie disappointed that he was not more widely known in England . Having lived for years in miserable surroundings , he became indifferent to his surroundings ; any room would do if it had a bed , a table and a rocking chair . From 1918 to 1922 , when he could have afforded a better home , he lived in an old-law tenement in Brooklyn . The dining room was Robinson 's study and there he received his guests , including two poets from Harvard . He Worked on a golden-oak pedestal table covered with a heavy vomit-colored cotton cloth ; behind him was a built-in china closet painted a hideous brown and containing , instead of dishes , neat piles of Sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lived in the flat through kindness for a boyhood friend whose wife had deserted him ; but I wondered why Robinson and the friend had n't moved , as they could easily have done , to a less dismal lodging . The truth seems to have been that he did n't notice the objects around him and was n't impressed by their shapes or colors . That would explain the bareness of his poems and their lack of visual images . He was cut off from any functional relationship with the community , as husband , father , employer or employed ; he was n't even a taxpayer until the success of Tristram in 1927 earned him a small fortune and enabled him to pay his old debts with New England scrupulosity . He was loyal , modest , full of compassion , and yet his curious separation from society threw him back on himself and , forced him to create his characters out of his own mind . He gave them wonderful names ? John Evereldown , Luke Haver-gal , Miniver Cheevy ? but in his later years he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long poems that he wrote after Tristram are like the conversations of ghosts in unfurnished rooms . Emery Neff refuses to admit that the poet had limitations . In his Edwin Arlington Robinson ( William Sloane ; $3.50 ) , a critical biography which is the second volume to appear in the new American Men of Letters Series , he argues that Robinson was not great in spite of his faultS , but simply great He describes the pamphlet that Rob- inson had printed at his own expense in 1896 as " the most distinguished first volume by an American poet . " It is very good indeed , but is it more distinguished than ? Emerson 's Poems ( 1847 ) or Whitman 's Leaves of Grass ( 1855 ) or Emily Dickinson 's Poems ? the first volume that appeared in 1890 after her death ? or T. S. Eliot 's Prufrock ( 1917 ) ? Curiously , the book has little to say about Robinson 's verse technique , the feature of his work that particularly interests other poets . Instead Neff asks us to admire Robinson as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That poem , he says , " bringing to bear upon the supreme problem of human destiny consummate qualities of intellect , human understanding and art , towers above any other poem written upon American soil . " Does it tower above Whitman 's " Song of Myself " ? or above Hart Crane 's " The Bridge " ? or even above Robinson 's shorter poems ? To me it seems to be written with a conventional eloquence that is not Robinson 's style at its best ; sometimes it suggests William Vaughn Moody . The consummate ideas to be found in the poem are chiefly complaints against scientific materialism in the forms it assumed during the 1890 's . What Robinson suggests in place of it is a sort of Buddho-Christianity too vague to be intellectually respectable . When I first read Neff 's book I was greatly impressed by the biographical sections , but that was before I had read Herman Hagedorn 's biography of Robinson , which , though published ten years ago , is still the best book about him . Neff has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to correct Hagedorn on minor points ; but he follows the general outlines of the earlier story while omitting some of the liveliest and most revealing episodes ; one that I missed was the vain assault on Robinson 's virtue by Isadora Duncan . Many of the episodes that do appear would seem to be merely rephrased from the earlier volume . Anyone with the two books open in front of him will find extremely close parallels ( see , for example , Neff 's pages 92-3 , 103 and 146-7 and compare them with pages 157-8 , 156 and 235-6 of Hagedorn ) . When Neff was following the earlier text so faithfully the courteous thing to do would have been to copy It word for word and put it between quotation marks . THE REAL EDUCATION THE YOUNG HENRY ADAMS , by Ernest Samuels ( The Harvard University Press ; $4.50 ) . EVEN THOUGH it takes him only to the verge of his mature and lasting work , Ernest Samuels ' study is the first adequate biography of Henry Adams . He has fully realized that the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its author young self , and has made a fresh start . Out of the abundant record of Adams ' early essays and the unceasing flow of his correspondence Samuels has revealed a quite different likeness . Adams Is not a figure many would study for the attractiveness of his personality . In the assessment he made of himself just after his graduation from college he noted two basic traits : " One is a continual tendency towards politics ; the other is family pride . " That combination could appear very charming to a circle of aristocratic intimates , but beyond that range Adams ' mixture of conceit and self-distrust often chilled people into regarding him as simply an acute case of the Harvard man . The center of Samuels ' interest , therefore , is in the development of the mind that was to come to Indian-summer ripeness , as Adams approached seventy , in Mont Saint Michel and Chartres and the Education , two of the most remarkable books of our intellectual history . These books have played an immensely influential role in heightening our sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samuels ' detailed examination of the genesis and persistence of Adams ' leading ideas constitutes a valuable chapter of our cultural background . The conservative literary tastes which Adams formed at Harvard during the late eighteen fifties remained with him throughout his life . He always admired Carlyle , and the quieter discipline of Burke upon his own style can be discerned even in his last writings . Guizot first challenged him to press beyond facts to establish the drift of history . But the young man whose Class Oration ' was permeated with the sense of the gulf between the moral order and the actual world had been permanently affected by a personality closer at hand . It was Agassiz who awakened his interest in science , Agassiz whose religious opposition to evolution was basically anti-rationalist . This influence was unfortunate for Adams ' later attempt to establish analogies between science and history . It meant that he had never been compelled to reckon strictly with experimental method before passing on to cosmic generalizations . It may not be too much to attribute to Agassiz 's tutelage the first seeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than for the world . Despite his declared " tendency towards politics , " the evidence shows that from the start the compulsive bias of his mind was inescapably literary . When he kept.copies of his letters home from abroad , he was quite aware of the example of the young Horace Walpole . It is fascinating to discover him also responding to the symbolic attraction of the careers pursued by the heroes of Disraeli and Bulwer-Lytton . He aspired to be a Coningsby or a Pelham , as he wore the clothes of a dandy and yet , also like Pelham , pored over Mill 's Essay on Government . During his years in London as his father 's secretary we can see him also agreeing with Buckle that historians were needed of a stature comparable to Kepler or Newton . It Is fitting that the first important historical essay of such a distilled New Englander should have been devoted to undermining the Southern legend
