The White Sea League <P> Russian soldiers drilled in short-center field . Outfielders stood ankle-deep in sand . The catcher 's mitt was a gunner 's asbestos glove ( for handling , hot shells ) with extra padding . It took four hours to make a baseball-from part of a rubber heel wound with string , covered with leather cut from gloves . Bats were whittled out of soft Russian pine . <P> Under such handicaps the White Sea League played ball . In Manhattan last week the story of U.S. sports 100 miles below the Arctic Circle was told by a member of the so-called " Forgotten Convoy " - four merchant ships marooned near Archangel from May to November last year . <P> The Russians lent a playing field next to the docks . Bases were marked with gunny sacks . The four teams , one from each ship , played hard-ball rules , but games lasted only seven innings : by then the ball was too lopsided and the bat was usually split . <P> Subarctic Series . Brooklyn 's left field had nothing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jeering at umpiring officers . Some afternoons , $500 changed hands-a quarter of all the money in the fleet . The outstanding star was Seaman 1st Class Joe Sienko , a husky twirler who learned baseball in a Catholic Youth league in Massachusetts . Behind his pitching on the Fourth of July , the Navy All-Stars walked away with the W.S.L. World Series , whipping a picked Merchant Marine nine , 19-to-7 . <P> The nearby Russian soldiers ignored the baseball . But when they discovered the sailors practicing basketball with a decrepit volleyball and backboards erected on the dock , they issued a challenge . After the first quarter , the U.S. scorer quit-his team was so far behind he had lost count . The Russians also challenged the sailors at swimming . After one practice in the icy waters , the sport was dropped . <P> As they must to all sportsmen , poker and craps finally came to the White Sea League. * Three-day games of five-card stud , with table stakes , no limit , became routine . The poker ended abruptly when one ship won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three . Craps redistributed the wealth , but not for long . A few days before the convoy finally sailed , the game became the property of two shipmates . One , a Yale alumnus , owned the dice . The other , a Sing Sing alumnus , had all the money . <P> <P> *Craps is a minor sport on shipboard . Crapshooters lose their balance and their money slides with the ship 's roll .
