The Japanese last week sold to U.S. Protestantism the idea that their new united Japan Christian Church is much better than it has been painted by journalists and missionaries recalled or soon-to-be-recalled from Nippon . <P> The selling was done by nine top-ranking Japanese Christians who foregathered unofficially with 16 influential representatives of U.S. churches at Riverside , Calif . After six days , the Americans seemed satisfied that there was nothing to get excited about in the recent restrictions on missionary activity in Japan . Briefly , the story told by Bishop Yoshimune Abe and his comrades was this : <P> For the first time in history , last summer war became an active possibility between the U.S. and a nation this country had evangelized . Japan reacted by banning foreign-mission executives and funds , more or less as the U.S. might ban German cultural agents from executive posts in American churches . Thereupon Japanese Christians did the logical thing : they took full control of their churches with un-oriental speed before their Government got still tougher . In so doing they merged 42 denominations into one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Episcopalians ( who refused to recognize the validity of the ministerial orders of the other denominations ) and the Seventh-Day Adventists ( who held out for a Saturday Sabbath ) . <P> These sudden moves startled American churchmen . They suspected that the new church was united more by Government pressure than by spiritual guidance , feared that Japanese Christians , regulated and dominated by a totalitarian State , might apostasize . But , said Bishop Abe : " The Government has not interfered and has no intention of interfering with the doctrine of the church . " Only State control is administrative enforcement of the 1940 Religious Bodies Law ( which recognizes Christianity as an official Japanese religion along with Shintoism and Buddhism ) . All church executives must be Japanese subjects , and no native church worker can be supported by foreigners ; but American mission boards can still pay the salaries of U.S. citizens working in Japan , can aid the Japanese churches financially provided they tie no string to their gifts . <P> Bishop Abe reported that before Japanese Christians agreed to the Government 's insistence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government gave written assurance that the observance is purely patriotic ( like uncovering at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier ) and in no way religious . On the same grounds , <P> Japanese Roman Catholics have been doing likewise . " The god we speak of here has a different meaning from the absolute God , " the bishop quoted from a Ministry of Education pronouncement on the Shinto divinity Amaterasu Omikami . Furthermore , to make the distinction clearer , the new church is changing the name of God from Kami ( the word for the Shinto divinities which early Christian missionaries adopted ) to the honorific Kamisama , Ainokami ( God of Love ) and Shu ( Lord ) .
