txt // And all this blood was the baptism of Domitian . In the beginning of his reign he became famous as an insect-hunter , spending whole days in catching flies and stabbing them with a sharp-pointed stylus . Later lie demanded bigger game , and amused himself by inserting fire in the privates of men , and killing them after dreadful torture and mutilation . He too occupied himself with public morals : enforced the laws against adultery , abolished the liberty of the stage , deprived courtesans of the use of litters and the right to receive inheritances and legacies , punished a Roman knight for pardoning an erring wife , expelled a senator for dancing , and buried vestal virgins alive for unchastity . Having improved the public morals , he placed his own conduct above the law , as we learn from Suetonius : " He was excessively lustful . His constant sexual intercourse he called bed-wrestling , as if it were a kind of exercise . It was reported that he depilated his concubines with his own hand and swam with common prostitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep by Clio 's graphium . Against this lurid background , Greek medicine reached its second climax before its ultimate fall ? always handicapped by the prohibition of human dissection . Senator and slave were never free from torture and death at the imperial whim , and more than one emperor 's head rolled at the feet of his praetorian guard ? but all were safe from anatomical investigation . The first Greek physician who settled in Rome was appropriately named Archagathus , which means a good beginning . Some fortunate operations caused the Romans to forget their prejudices , for the Senate purchased a taberna for Archagathus in the crowded Acilian crossway , and conferred citizenship upon him . Intoxicated with unexpected success , Archagathus now indulged in such burning and cutting that only the undertakers continued to smile upon him , and his title of wound-curer ( Vulnerarius ) was changed to executioner ( Carnifex ) . All this we learn from Pliny , who quotes it from the old Roman compiler Cassius Hemina ; no Greek author mentions Archagathus , and Pliny is never above suspicion . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the anointed and spice-sprinkled corpse , was winding its dolorous way through the streets of Rome . A physician who was returning from the suburbs to the city , happened to be passing , and professional instinct caused him to approach the body . Unpeen by the mourners , he managed to touch the dead man , and ertainly no one saw the dead man move . With lagging feet , and in silence broken only by weeping , they came nearer the pyre . Suddenly the loud commanding voice of the physician startled all : " I am Asclepiades , and I say take this funeral feast from e pyre to the table . " Some turned in anger and mockery upon him ? were they the heirs already in possession of the inheritance ? ? but others insisted that the physician be heeded . While the discussion continued , Asclepiades brought the body to his house , applied restoratives which reestablished respiration , and the supposed corpse participated in his own funeral festivities . The name of Asclepiades is undoubtedly suggestive of Aesculapius , and this sensational incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Asclepiades , a native of Prusa in Bythia , which is in Asia Minor , began his career by teaching rhetoric . He found he could not make much money as a rhetorician , but it helped him enormously in medicine . In fact , Asclepiades had enough of the charlatan in him to make him a popular practitioner . He started out by abusing his predecessors , and reversing all medical rules ; this attracts attention . Did others attribute disease to a disturbance of the humors ? The opposite of humoralism is solidism , and thus Asclepiades declared that disease is due to constriction or relaxation of the solid particles . We ceased to suffer from atra bilis , only to be afflicted by strictum et laxum . Did Hippocrates say , " Nature is the healer of disease ? " Then Asclepiades said , " Not only is nature useless , it may even be harmful . A natural healing power , curing diseases by design , is a delusion . The physician must actively interfere with nature . It is the physician 's duty to cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the origin of the classic phrase : tuto , cito et jucunde. ) 2 THE STORY OF MEDICINE Democritus made the atom famous , but Asclepiades was : he first who built a system of pathology on the atom . Health signifies that the atoms in the pores are present in such proDortions that their movement is unimpeded , and disease is the - esult of a disturbed movement of the atoms . The atomic materialism of Democritus was the foundation of the philosophy ) f Epicurus , which in its turn was the inspiration of Lucretius ' 9n the Nature of Things ? the supreme product of Latin genius . It is a hard task , " wrote Lucretius , " in Latin verses to set dearly in the light the dark discoveries of the Greek , above all when many things must be treated in new words , because of the poverty of our tongue and the newness of the themes . " The Greek-inspired Roman succeeded so well in his discussion of the first beginnings , that De rerurn natura is as significant a contribution to science as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anthropology , biology , medicine and psychology . Whether dealing with the formation of the world , the size of the sun and stars , the cause of the moon 's light , the origin of human life and primitive man , the first steps of civilization , the mortality of the soul and its connection with the body , the swerve of the infinity of atoms , the porousness of solid things , the permanence of matter and motion , the folly of the fear of death , the special senses and physiological functions , the law of plague and disease ; whether hurling his hexameters at superstition and supernaturalism , or exposing the lightning that strikes the innocent and spares the guilty , or describing with deepest pathos the action of a cow over her lost calf , we feel in the presence of Lucretius one of the loftiest spirits of antiquity , which the clashing centuries can never dim . His poem in six books , concluding with the Thucydidesian plague of Athens , was never finished , but it ranks as the culminating flower of Epicurianism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept the strange tale that Lucretius was poisoned by a love-philtre and killed himself in his prime ? We know so little of the life of Lucretius . He was contemporaneous // with Asclepiades , and if the physician had been able to save the poet 's life until his reed was worn , it would have been his greatest achievement . Asclepiades has much to his credit : he was the first who definitely divided diseases into acute and chronic ; the first who opened the dark cells of the insane , treating the mentally afflicted with sunlight and gentleness , with music and song ; he was familiar with the psychic complications of pneumonia and pleurisy ; his definitions of frenzy , lethargy and catalepsy could go in a dictionary ; his description of malaria places him among the great clinicians . This ex-rhetorician was a foreigner , but he knew his Romans . His most frequent prescription called for wine , either pure or diluted with sea-water ; in the post-febrile state , he permitted luxurious meals ; even when treating baldness , he looked after the diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds and hanging baths ; no patient received a bitter medicine from him , but many were told they must take up walking , riding or dancing ? to set the stagnant atoms in motion ; in some cases he prescribed plenty of sleep , and in others sexual intercourse , which was then regarded as gymnastic exercise . The Romans hailed him as a heaven-sent messenger , and he has been called the Father of Fashionable Physicians . Pliny 's criticism discredits Pliny rather than Asclepiades : " There is , however , one thing , and one thing only , at which we have any ground for indignation ? the fact , that a single individual , and he belonging to the most frivolous nation in the world , a man born in utter indigence , should all on a sudden , and that , too , for the sole purpose of increasing his income , give a new code of medical laws to mankind . " So suave was Aesclepiaides that Crassius and Mucius were his friends , and Atticus and Cicero his eulogists . Mithridates invited him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books instead . Asclepiades had many disciples , the most conspicuous being Themison of Laodicea , who molded the solidist pathology into a system : disease is the result of rigidity , dependent upon con STORY OF MEDICINE 94 tracted and narrow pores ( status strictus ) , or of relaxation due to loose and wide pores ( status laxus ) ; this was too simple to be satisfying , since both conditions may occur in one disease , and therefore a mixed condition was recognized ( status mixtus ) . The treatment was obvious : large pores should be reduced , and small pores enlarged ? the principle that contraries are cured by contraries ( contraria contrarius curantur ) . Themison considered his doctrines a middle way or method between the dogmatists and empiricists , and was responsible for the formation of another medical sect ? the Methodic School . Themison is quoted by Seneca , Pliny , Soranus , Galen , Caelius Aurelianus , and Dioscorides , who relates that Themison was once bitten by a mad dog , and therefore could not write on rabies without developing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his doctrines with characteristic im-partiality . Themison did not escape a thrust from the terrible pen of Juvenal . It occurs in the midst of a devastating picture of Old Age extending over several appalling pages : " Besides all this , the little blood in the old man 's chilly frame is never warm ex-cept with fever . All kinds of diseases dance around him in a troop . If you were to ask their names , I could sooner tell you how many lovers Hippia had ; how many patients Themison has killed off in a single autumn ; how many partners Basilus has cheated ; how many wards Hirrus has corrupted ; how many embraces tall Maura has submitted to in a single day . " The world respects Juvenal because he was so magnificent a hater , but we must not expect the satirist who coined the expression of matrimonial halter , and greeted a rake 's announcement that he had found a girl of old-fashioned virtue with the exclama-tion , " 0 physicians ! open the middle vein , he is mad ! " ? to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hippocratic aphorism , " Life is short and the art long , " and then boast that he had reversed it . But the weaver 's son , Thessalus of Tralles , most notorious of the Methodics , shortened it still more ? he guaranteed to teach // the medical art in six months to all who wished to be physicians , and previous experience was not necessary . Dyers , rope-makers , butchers and tanners , cooks and cobblers crowded his heels , eager to exchange their former occupations for the practice of medicine ? did not the doctor Stertinius earn six hundred thousand sesterces per annum ? Pliny speaks of Thessalus as " a man who swept away all the precepts of his predecessors , and declaimed with a sort of frenzy against the physicians of every age ; but with what discretion and in what spirit , we may abundantly conclude from a single trait presented by his character : upon his tomb , which is still to be seen on the Appian Way , he had his name inscribed as the latronices ? the Conqueror of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chariot , had a greater throng attending him when he appeared in public . " How Galen raged when he passed the Via Appia and saw that mausoleum ! If Thessalians were standing around , he raised his voice . . . . " Thessalus , impudent , insolent , stupid , barbarous , asinine . Yes , that worthless son of a weaver , whose only education was the gossip of the women 's wool-spinning room . You asses of Thessalus . . . . " The name of Thessalus has descended to posterity as the model of a quack . He had a natural talent for therapeutics , but unfortunately for medicine , his arrogance was remembered and his merit forgotten : Thessalus taught his pupils at the bedside , and by bringing them into actual contact with disease , he stands out as a founder of the polyclinic . This practice is alluded to in one of Martial 's best-known epigrams : Languid I lay , and thou earnest , 0 Symmachus , quickly to see me ; Quickly thou Gamest and with thee a hundred medical students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the north wind . Ague before I had none , but now , by Apollo , I have it . Of the three great Roman encyclopedists , Marcus Terentius Varro , the Sabfs:e savant , is the earliest . The brutal Marc Antony deprived him of his library , but the old polymath died // with his pen in his hand . His comprehensive work ? it was in forty-two sections ? on Antiquities has perished along with his book on medicine , but as soon as we open Pliny , Plutarch , Aulus Gellius and Macrobius , and note their frequent citations , we realize that Varro is one of the standard sources of knowledge . He knew that the earth is shaped like a great egg , and at eighty he wrote a book on farming ( Rerum rusticarum ) which contains these remarkable lines on microorganisms : " Small creatures , invisible to the eye , fill the atmosphere in marshy localities , and with the air breathed through the nose and mouth penetrate into the human body , thereby causing dangerous diseases . " That Varro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know it , is a misfortune . Varro , as an adherent of Pompey , found himself in conflict more than once with Julius Caesar , but instead of following the prevalent custom and destroying him , Caesar utilized his scholarship , and some of Varro 's books are dedicated to the dictator . While Julius Caesar was enough of an internationalist to grant citizenship to certain Greek physicians , their status was not definitely improved until the reign of his successor . Augustus suffered from a disease which his contemporaries were as unsuccessful in relieving as posterity is in diagnosing . It is undetermined whether the imperial malady was liver trouble or gout or constipation , but it is on record that several physicians exhausted their arts in vain . Standing on the brink of fame , they passed into oblivion . Then Augustus summoned to his sick-room his former slave , the well-educated Antonius Musa , a Greek who had studied medicine in order to take care of his sick father . When a monarch is the patient , medicine becomes melodramatic ; if a remedy is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effected , the physician is elevated to the nobility . As the illness of Augustus had not yielded to warm baths and hot fomentations , Musa boldly reversed the treatment , and drenched the world 's princeps civitatis with draughts of cold water , and made him eat lettuce . Augustus recovered , and his gratitude was immense : not only did he endow Musa // with money and grant him citizenship , but he invested him with the gold ring of knighthood , and sponsored a public subscription which erected the statue of Antonius Musa in brass , by the side of the God of Medicine in the Aesculapian temple which adorned the island in the Tiber . Cold douching became one of the cardinal principles of balneology , and Horace informs us that the myrtle groves and warm sulphur springs at Baiae were deserted for the chilly fountains of Elusium . The astute and fortunate freedman now acquired the most unforgettable clientele in history , for among the immortal invalids who sought health at the hands of Musa were Marcus Agrippa , Maecenas , Virgil and Horace . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and these fragments are not precious . Various remedies , with his name attached , were quoted by Galen and employed for generations , but have disappeared with the rising tide of pharmacologic skepticism . He introduced into therapeutics the lettuce ? of which he was an ardent champion ? and chicory and endive ; his brother Euphorbus was medical adviser to the gifted King Juba of Mauritania , who discovered near Mount Atlas the medical plant which he graciously named Euphorbia in honor of his physician ? at least so the anecdotist Pliny says . Antonius Musa certainly holds no rank among the great physicians of antiquity , but he is of historic interest because his popularity with the masters of his day acted as an antidote to the warning of Cato : " I forbid you to have anything to do with physicians . " Menecrates , physician to the emperor Tiberius , labored industriously over his 155 works , including a treatise on pharmacology , but he is now remembered for his early use of escharotics , as the first who suggested that in prescriptions the capricious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as the inventor of the famous Diachylon Plaster , which was celebrated ? along with tooth-powders ? in iambic verse by one of the rhyming physicians of the period , Servilius Damocrates . In the reign of Tiberius , we meet the second of the encyclopedists , Aurelius Cornelius Celsus . Since Celsusis believed to // have been a Roman patrician , it is inferred he was not a practi-tioner , and the ever-quoted Pliny names him among the auctores instead of the medici . Yet the breadth of his vision , his im-partiality of outlook , the serenity of his judgment , and the vivacity of his observations , combined with the elegance of his Latinity ? he was called Cicero medicorum ? have combined to make his work one of the imperishable monuments of antiquity . An accident is sometimes propitious : nearly the whole of his all-embracing encyclopedia has disappeared , except De re medicina , which survives to keep green the name of Celsus . The opening passage is characteristically Celsian : " As agri-culture promises food to the healthy , so medicine promises health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world where this art is not found : for even the most barbarous nations are acquainted with herbs , and other easy remedies for wounds and diseases . However , it has been more improved by the Greeks than any other people . " We can not discuss the history of Chirurgia with-out quoting Celsus ' qualifications of a surgeon : " A surgeon ought to be young , or at any rate , not very old ; his hand should be firm and steady , and never shake ; he should be able to use his left hand with as much dexterity as his right ; his eye-sight should be acute and clear ; his mind intrepid , and so far subject to pity as to make him desirous of the recovery of his patient , but not so far as to suffer himself to be moved by his cries ; he should neither hurry the operation more than the case re-quires , nor cut less than is necessary , but do everything just as if the other 's screams made no impression upon him . " Celsus is notable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical student : redness , swelling , heat and pain ( rubor et tumor , cum calore et dolore ) . His reference to " pus discharging from the ear , leading to insanity and death , " is an early recognition of meningitis . His " distemper seated in the large intestine principally affecting that part where I men-tioned the caecum to be , accompanied by violent inflammation and vehement pains , particularly in the right side , " is an unsur-passed description of a disease which was supposed to be disGREEK // covered in modern times ? appendicitis . He was the first to mention that a vessel may be ruptured within the cranium , without fracture or depression ; the first to use such terms as heart disease ( cardiacus ) and insanity ( insania ) ; and the first to describe circular amputation by a single sweep of the knife . He considered amputation " the last sad remedy , " permissible only in gangrene ; circular amputation is still known as Celsus ' operation . Other eponyms are in dermatology , for Celsus described forty skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called Celsus ' papules , anesthetic leprosy is Celsus ' vitiligo , the soft chancre is known as Celsus ' chancre , suppurating ringworm of the scalp is called Celsus ' kerion , and the ever-famous condition of patchy baldness ( alopecia areata ) is not less distressing because it bears the classic name of Celsus ' area . He was a pioneer in the history of medicine , and in such diverse fields as dentistry , laryngology , ophthalmology , lithotorny and plastic surgery ? reparative work was needed by those Jews who wished to hold office among the Romans and could not do so if they lacked a prepuce . The Hippocratic writers treated hemorrhage by cold , pressure , styptics , and finally the actual cautery ; nowhere do they refer to the ligature . Taking a hint from the Alexandrians , Celsus gives us the first satisfactory account of arresting hemorrhage , for after mentioning dry lint , cold sponge , compression , vinegar , corrosives and caustics , he writes , " Finally , if the bleeding continues it will be necessary to grasp the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it above and below the wounded part , and then divide the vessel between the two ligatures in order that it may retract . " Celsus is one of the mysteries of medicine : if he was a physician , we can not understand why he apologized for using certain anatomical terms ; if not a physician , it is still more difficult to understand how he acquired his technical knowledge . Another reason why some do not consider h , m a pras.t:tioner is rather curious ; it is due to " the delicacy of his censure in condemning ioo THE STORY OF MEDICINE others . " If his work is only a compilation from the Greek , it is nevertheless in a class by itself ? never before or since has there been so original a translation . Aside from the Hippocratic writings , Celsus is the most ancient medical classic extant , and will never grow old . An enthusiastic collector of formulae ? which he derived from the most varied sources , by all sorts of methods , including bribery ? was Scribonius Largus , whose book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earliest of pharmacopeias . De compositione medicamentorum was received with favor by the emperor Claudius , whom Scribonius Largus accompanied on his expedition for the conquest of Britain . Scribonius likewise acted as physician to Claudius ' third wife , the loving Messallina , who was always ready to doff the purple robes of office to appear naked in the public brothel . Scribonius describes in detail , the ingredients of the tooth-powder that Messallina employed . The relationship between this medicus and the warmblooded spouse of Claudius was evidently strictly professional , in which respect the discreet Scribonius differed from his colleague Vettius Valens , who not only prescribed for his young empress , but committed adultery with her ? until the day of discovery . This little intrigue is characteristic of the mad period in which royal ladies set the pace in salacity , and wives poisoned husbands for pastime , and parents and children debauched and murdered each other . In the thick of this welter of darkness and gore , when the monstrous boy Nero was permitted to destroy a Seneca , it is pathetic to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Scribonius possessed a noble conception of the duties of the medical profession , and his book is not only the first pharmacopeia , but a code of ethics . Scribonius Largus , then , deserves a wreath as one of the few practitioners of his age who honored the Hippocratic Oath , as the first who presented an accurate method of obtaining opium , and , as the first who suggested the repeated application GREEK MEDICINE IN ROME ror of the electric ray-fish in headache and facial neuralgia , which is probably the earliest use of electricity in therapeutics . Dioscorides , an army surgeon in the service of Nero , in which capacity he traveled extensively , everywhere on the lookout for medicines , is the greatest of medical botanists . In the sense that Hippocrates is the Father of Medicine , and Theophrastus the Father of Botany , Dioscorides is the Father of Materia Medica . Dioscorides came from a province in Asia Minor , and spoke Greek with an accent , but he wrote so clearly that many of his descriptions of ancient plants enabled these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on materia medica is a limitless storehouse from which all subsequent ages have drawn information . Opium was known long before his time , but Dioscorides was the first who distinctly praised it . He pointed out that it allays pain , induces sleep , is useful in chronic coughs , and in overdoses occasions a deep and terrible lethargy . He distinguished the juice of the capsules from the extract of the entire plant , and described how the capsules should be incised . He explained how to prepare lard for medicinal purposes , and his method of preparing elaterium has been only slightly modified in recent times . He knew the therapeutic applications of linseed , and gave the technic of making vinegar of squills . He was the first to mention ginger , aconite and ammoniacum , and the first who discussed the therapeutics of aloes . He gave mercury its name of hydrargyrum , or fluid silver . He recommended aspidium for tape-worm . He refers to the astringent properties of iron , and advocated its use in uterine hemorrhage . He knew also that all oaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for detecting adulterations in drugs . An enthusiastic student counted 958 remedies in Dioscorides , and of course he overlooked some . As a birth-controller , Dioscorides seems to have been neutral , for while he mentions medicines for the prevention of conception , he likewise specified remedies for promoting the birth of children . The third of the encyclopedists , Pliny the Elder , disliked Greece and resented its culture , yet was constrained to say , " My // object is to treat of all those things which the Greeks include in the Encyclopedia , " and amid his official duties for the Roman emperors he followed Greek culture with a fidelity that makes his name a symbol of the unwearied student . We learn from his nephew and heir , Pliny the Younger , that the uncle began work long before daybreak , that he extracted from all he read , saying there was no book so bad as not to contain something of value , that he listened to the reading of his secretaries even while he was rubbed in the bath , as he deemed all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Licinus offered him a fortune for his material , but Pliny would not have parted with it for the Golden House of Nero . Pliny studied so hard that he had no time for reflection . He swallowed huge chunks of knowledge raw , he gulped it down whole , for that capacious palate could not discriminate between fact and fable . He verified nothing , he rejected no story that was interesting . He was convinced that men who compose books are scholars and not liars , and what was good enough for them was good enough for him . Did not Mutianus say he knew an elephant who could write Greek ? If Mutianus , who was three times consul , believed it , why not Pliny ? Does not Mucianus speak of shell-fish stopping a vessel in full sail because it was freighted with boys of noble birth who were sent off by Periander to be castrated ? Why not insert this in the section on fish ? Was it not stated that the lion could tell by the peculiar odor of the panther that the lioness had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that the female when guilty of a lapse , washes herself or else follows the lion at a considerable distance ? This was too good to lose , and we can picture Pliny seizing it with avidity for his chapter on lions . Pliny had been a commander of cavalry , and knew a good deal about horses , even mentioning hermaphrodite horses ; he claims that if horses are tricked into committing incest , they will kill themselves or the groom ; he quotes King juba 's remark that Queen Semiramis was so enamored of a horse as to cohabit with it ; forgetting a previous statement that only man sheds // tears , he speaks of weeping horses . Perhaps his most remarkable horse-story is in connection with Apelles : during a pictorial contest , this artist found that his rivals were likely to get the better of him through intrigue , and decided to appeal from the judgment of his fellow-men to the true authorities . Accordingly , horses were shown the various portraits of themselves , which they passed by without notice , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to whinny ; and it has always been the case since , continues Pliny , whenever this test of his artistic skill has been employed . Pliny ate eggs , and saw egg-shells ; he gathered information about eggs until he was able to describe twenty-two remedies derived from eggs ; then he wrote : " Of such strength is an eggshell , that if it is set upright and not inclined to one side , no force or weight can break it . " Aulus Gellius , who says Pliny was considered the most learned man of his time , quotes these words from him : " Yawning during childbirth is fatal , just as to sneeze after coition produces abortion . " Such is the result of closing one 's eyes and immersing one 's self in erudition . In his book on man , Pliny , after assembling his notes from Herodotus , Aristotle , Varro , Isigonus , Nymphodorus , Apollonides , Megasthenes , Crates of Pergamus , Beeton and many others , especially Ctesias , evidently wishes to prepare us for some stories that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , could ever believe in the existence of the Negroes , who had not first seen them ? Indeed , what is there that does not appear marvellous , when it comes to our knowledge for the first time ? " Following this warning , he tells us of various races of man : of the Arimaspi , who have but one eye in the middle of the forehead and carry on a perpetual conflict with the gold-guarding Griffins ; of the Illyria who have two pupils in each eye ; of another tribe who are without necks , and have their eyes in their shoulders ; of the Triballi , who can kill an enemy by fixing their gaze upon him ; of the inhabitants of Abarimon , whose feet are turned backwards ; of the Monocoli , who have only one leg , but are able to leap with surprising agility ; of the Thibii , who can not drown in // water ; of the Scyritae , who have no nostrils , but holes in their faces ; of the Astomi , who have no mouths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pandore , whose hair is white in youth and black in old age ; of men born with long tails ; of others , who have ears so large as to cover the whole body ; and of Indians who have connections with animals , the offspring being half man and half beast . These wonders uplift the soul of Pliny , who exclaims , " Nature , in her ingenuity , has created all these marvels in the human race , with others of a similar nature , as so many amusements to herself , though they appear miraculous to us . But who is there that can enumerate all the things that she brings to pass each day , I may almost say each hour ? As a striking evidence of her power , let it be sufficient for me to have cited whole nations in the list of her prodigies . Let us now proceed to mention some other particulars connected with Man , the truth of which is universally admitted . " Then follows an equally chimerical catalogue , interesting and multifarious , but with scant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Pliny is invariably preposterous . His science is usually addled , but his interjections are often admirable , as witness : " But it is the belly , for the gratification of which the greater part of mankind exist , that causes the most suffering to man . It is for its sake , more particularly , that avarice is so insatiate , for its sake that luxury is so refined , for its sake that men voyage to the shores even of the Phasis , for its sake that the very depths of the ocean are ransacked . And yet , with all this , no one ever gives a thought how abject is the condition of this part of our body , how disgusting the results of its action upon what it has received ! " As a collector of data , he had few equals . Of his voluminous writings , only the thirty-seven books of his Natural History remain , and his nephew , in the letter to Baebius Macer , was not tar wrong when he described it as " a work remarkable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature herself . " Since the younger Pliny , in the epistle to Sura , // relates in detail a full-fledged ghost-story ? including a haunted house , silence , rattling of chains and bones ? and says he believes it , he probably found nothing amiss with the Natural History . It is impossible to give an idea of these volumes ? thousands of pages of useful information , mixed with the absurdest nonsense ever written under the auspices of science , interlarded with many excellent comments . Had the mind of Pliny been of a higher type , his Natural History would not be a treasure-house of endless curios . His errors no longer misinform us , and the items remain to charm the succeeding generations . Pliny is inimitable . He had no qualifications for science , except industry and enthusiasm . He is so anxious to give us information , that he lies without limit . His discussion of menstruation is characteristically Plinian : It would indeed be a difficult matter to find anything which is productive of more marvellous effects than the menstrual discharge . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will become sour , seeds which are touched by her become sterile , grafts wither away , garden plants are parched up , and the fruit will fall from the tree beneath which she sits . Her very look , even , will dim the brightness of mirrors , blunt the edge of steel , and take away the polish from ivory . . . . Over and above these particulars , there is no limit to the marvellous powers attributed to females . For , in the first place , hailstorms , they say , whirlwinds , and lightning even , will be scared away by a woman uncovering her body while her monthly courses are upon her . The same , too , with all other kinds of tempestuous weather ; and out at sea , a storm may be lulled by a woman uncovering her body merely , even though not menstruating at the time . As to the menstrual discharge itself , a thing that in other respects , as already stated on a more appropriate occasion , is productive of the most monstrous effects , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unutterable nature . Of these particulars , however , I do not feel so much shocked at mentioning the following . If the menstrual discharge coincides with an eclipse of the moon , or sun , the evils resulting from it are irremediable ; and no less so , when it happens while the moon is in conjuncio6 THE STORY OF MEDICINE tion with the sun ; the congress with a woman at such a period being noxious , and attended with fatal effects to the man . At this period also , the lustre of purple is tarnished by the touch of a woman : so much more baneful is her influence at this time than at any other . At any other time , also , if a woman strips herself naked while she is menstruating , and walks round a field of wheat , the caterpillars , worms , beetles , and other vermin , will fall from off the ears of corn . Metrodorus of Scepsos tells us that this discovery was first made in Cappadocia ; and that , in consequence of such multitudes of cantharides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for women to walk through the middle of the fields with their garments tucked up above the thighs . In other places , again , it is the usage for women to go barefoot , with the hair dishevelled and the girdle loose : due precaution must be taken , however , that this is not done at sun-rise , for if so , the crop will wither and dry up . Young vines , too , it is said , are injured irremediably by the touch of a woman in this state ; and both rue and ivy , plants possessed of highly medicinal virtues , will die instantly upon being touched by her . Much as I have already stated on the virulent effects of this discharge , I have to state , in addition , that bees , it is a well-known fact , will forsake their hives if touched by a menstruous woman ; that linen boiling in the cauldron will turn black , that the edge of a razor will become blunted , and that copper vessels will contract a fetid smell and become covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mare big with foal , if touched by a woman in this state , will be sure to miscarry ; nay , even more than this , at the very sight of a woman , though seen at a distance even , should she happen to be menstruating for the first time after the loss of her virginity , or for the first time , while in a state of virginity . Icetidas the physician pledges his word that quartan fever may he cured by sexual intercourse , provided the woman is just beginning to menstruate . It is universally agreed , too , that when a person has been bitten by a dog and manifests a dread of water and of all kinds of drink , it will be quite sufficient to put under his cup a strip of cloth that has been dipped in this fluid ; the result being that the hydrophobia will immediately disappear . This arises , no doubt , from that powerful sympathy which has been so much spoken of by the Greeks , and the existence of which is proved by the fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluid . // Another thing universally acknowledged and one which I am ready to believe with the greatest pleasure , is the fact , that if the doorposts are only touched with the menstruous fluid all spells of the magicians will be neutralized a set of men the most lying in existence , as any one may ascertain . I will give an example of one of the most reasonable of their prescriptions ? Take the parings of the toe-nails and finger-nails of a sick person , and mix them up with wax , the party saying that he is seeking a remedy for a tertian , quartan , or quotidian fever , as the case may be ; then stick this wax , before sunrise , upon the door of another person , such is the prescription they give for these diseases ! What deceitful persons they must be if there is no truth in it ! And how highly criminal , if they really do thus transfer diseases from one person to another ! Some of them , again , whose practices are of a less guilty nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown at the entrance of ant-holes , the first ant to be taken which attempts to draw one into the hole ; this , they say , must be attached to the neck of the patient , and he will experience a speedy cure . It is odd to hear the gullible Pliny , after immersing his readers in the deepest sorcery , raising an indignant voice against magicians . It was Pliny 's destiny to devote himself to what he thought he disliked . Had he been asked his opinion of the medical profession , and especially of Greek physicians , he would have drawn his toga around him with disdain as sadness clouded his eyes . Horace was not the only Roman who said " Captive Greece has taken captive her rude conquerer . " Pliny complains in more prosaic but equally emphatic terms : " Yes , avow it we must ? the Roman people , in extending its empire , has lost sight of its ancient manners , and in that we have conquered we are the conquered : for now we obey the natives of foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have even out-generalled our generals . More , however , on this topic hereafter . " Pliny liked to remind his readers that for six hundred years the Romans knew no physicians , and he also liked the epitaph he found on a tomb-stone : " He died by reason of the confusion io8 THE STORY OF MEDICINE of the doctors . " Pliny wrote , " The dignity of the Roman does not permit him to make a profession of medicine , and the few Romans who begin to study it are venal renegades to the Greeks . " But Pliny was fonder of medicine than he knew , otherwise he would not have devoted so much attention to it . Nearly all parts of the Naturalis historia are of some medical interest , while several of its books are exclusively medical . The debt of medi-cine to Pliny is simply incalculable . He has preserved for us all the old systems of medicine as he understood them , with count-less anecdotes and details that no one else would have dreamt of putting on paper . The names of scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a single one of the thirty-seven books he discusses : whether words are possessed of any healing efficacy ; remedies from the wax of the human ear , hair , teeth , blood , excretions , and the dead ; remedies obtained from sneez-ing , from the sexual congress , woman 's milk and spittle ; reme-dies from foreign animals ? nineteen from the crocodile ; remedies to be adopted against enchantments , poisons , baldness , tooth-ache , tonsillitis , pains in the neck , spitting of blood , stomach and liver complaints , tapeworm and trouble in the colon , gout and diseases of the feet , epilepsy , jaundice , melancholy , lethargy , phthisis , asthma , dropsy , erysipelas , hemorrhage , ulcers , car-cinomatous sores and broken bones . This learned layman never hesitates ; he knows every detail about medicine ? did he not read it , and can not he cite his authorities ? The Naturalis his-toria is a portentous jest , but it is certain that from the first century A.D. to the present time , no one has written a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not write about history or geography , science or medicine , literature or art , without quoting Pliny ? and it is never necessary to believe him . Babbling , garrulous , credulous Pliny ? how indispensable he is ! Whoever has not pored long hours over his Pliny , has missed one of the greatest delights that reading affords . Few works of antiquity are more instructive , fewer still are so entertaining . Better that Pliny should have been saved , than that the Colosseum should still be standing . Had the // Naturalis historia of Pliny perished with the rest of his works , much of the savor of antiquity would have been lost . The character of Pliny deserves our highest admiration . It is strange that one so lost in superstition and overwhelmed by magic should not have believed in a future life ? he states plainly that after death the soul has no more existence than it had before birth ? but he worked until his last day . Unequipped to investigate science , he nevertheless was a martyr of science . The world knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tacitus who informed posterity . On the twenty-fourth of August 79 A.D. , Pliny was in command of a fleet at Misenum . He had bathed and lunched and was engaged in study when his attention was directed to an unusual cloud . His habitual curiosity was immediately aroused , and calling for his shoes , he ascended a hill . The younger Pliny declined to accompany him , and remained at home reading a volume of Livy . Pliny breathed heavily as he climbed , for he was fifty-six and fat . It was more than a cloud that Pliny saw ? it was a volcanic force . He could have escaped , but he could not desert a scientific phenomenon . The sea ebbed , cities rocked and mountains slipped ; day was darker than night , and pumice and sulphur blotted out the sun ; life stopped as the volcano spread for the inhabitants an eternal blanket of ashes . On the third day they found Pliny near Pompeii , his body fully clothed , and without a sign of injury . But a vapor from Vesuvius had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who long ago had disappeared in the crater of Mount Etna . The name of Pliny is imperishable , and the concluding words of his Naturalis historia constitute his own best epitaph : " Farewell , Nature , parent of all things , and in thy manifold multiplicity bless me who , alone of the Romans , has sung thy praise . " The prolix Galen complains of the Syrian Archigenes of Apamea : " It should have been the special duty of Archigenes , who appeared on the scene next in order after a series of the most illustrious physicians , to infuse more light into medical Ito THE STORY OF MEDICINE teaching . Unfortunately , he did the very opposite ; for we who have grown old in the exercise of the art , and should therefore find it easy to comprehend what is written about medicine , are at times unable to understand what he says . Such being the true state of affairs , I now propose to undertake what Archigenes failed to accomplish . " From the surviving fragments , however , we wish we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archigenes . Elsewhere , even Galen speaks highly of him , and it is now claimed that much of Aretaeus and Aetius is derived from Archigenes . The ancients had admirable qualities , but their utter disregard of quotation-marks has wrinkled the brow of posterity . Archigenes wrote the best contemporary account of leprosy ; distinguished between primary and secondary symptoms in disease ; attempted to locate the pathology by the variety of pain ; suggested classification of mineral waters according to their composition ; and found time ? in the intervals of using the vaginal speculum and prescribing hair-dyes for the fashionable ladies  --  to become the author of the most elaborate of the ancient treatises on the pulse . As a member of the Pneumatici ? a sect which took its name from the pneuma or vital spirit , and was founded by Athenaeus of Cilicia ? this was expected from Archigenes , for the pneumatists were subtle , and it has been said that although they discovered new diseases , they established more varieties of fever than exist in nature . Archigenes was one of the great surgeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and womb , and amputating limbs , with employment of the ligature , in a manner that we consider modern . Surprisingly enough , Archigenes , thrice-mentioned by Juvenal , escapes unscathed from those grim hands , but the satirist has branded with eternal infamy the name of another great surgeon ? Heliodorus . Shocked translators omit the passage in which juvenal depicts T-leliodorus castrating robust young slaves so their lustful mistresses may use them with impunity : " matron and maid , the sex has turned all whore ; to escape abortion they love the eunuchs , but only such as have been gelded at manhood 's age ; all that the navel-string could give is present . GREED MEDICINE IN ROME except the beard ? and that 's the barber 's loss , not theirs . " History can not be written by prudes . Had his writings survived , Heliodorus would be a famous figure . The fragments saved by the devotion of Oribasius , and later by Nicetas ? on probing injuries of the skull , bandaging , torsion of blood-vessels , flap and circular amputations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ample evidence of a great surgeon . One passage , which incidentally reveals the surgeons of that time as operating with needless rapidity , exhibits Heliodorus as a pioneer of the ligature : " Amputation above the elbow or knee is very dangerous owing to the size of the vessels divided . Some operators in their foolish haste cut through all the soft parts at one stroke , but it seems to me better to first divide the flesh on the side away from the vessels , and then to saw the bone , so as to be ready at once to check the bleeding when the large vessels are cut . And before operating , it is my habit to tie a ligature as tightly as possible above the point of amputation . " Another surgeon who lives only in fragments is Antyllus . We grope through the centuries , reading the works of his successors , grateful to Oribasius , seizing upon the few lines in Paulus Aegineta , invading the vast Continens of Rhazes for a reference , always hoping for additional information about Antyllus . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He operated on the opaque crystalline lens without injuring the humor , relieved suffocation by cutting into the windpipe , repaired or restored defective organs with the neighboring skin and connective tissue , removed diseased portion of bone without disturbing its continuity , and extracted bones in their entirety while preserving the joint . This master of major surgery did not neglect the little things which count for so much : when he mentions plasters or ointments , he tells how to prepare and spread them ; if he speaks of wet or dry cupping , he describes the bronze , horn and glass vessels ; if he recommends the natural or artificial leech , he explains how it should be applied ; if he discusses abscesses , he // points out the lines of incision ; when necessary to probe a fistula , he shows how to make a bougie from rolled papyrus ; when he visited a patient he regulated the temperature and lighting of his home , instructed him whether or not to indulge in gymnastics , told him what to eat and drink , how to bathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the creator of arterial surgery , and was the first to distinguish aneurysm caused by pathological dilatation and aneurysm forming after trauma of the artery . When he treated a circumscribed distention of the arterial wall by ligating the aneurysm above and below the pulsating sac , followed by opening the aneurysm and evacuating its bloody contents , he projected his name to the present time , for the method of Antyllus is still pictured in the textbooks and defined in the dictionaries . Soranus of Ephesus in Asia Minor ? nearly all the leading Greek physicians of the Roman empire came from Asia Minor ? stands out as the first specialist in diseases of women and children . Like most of the famous physicians of the time , he studied in Alexandria , and settled in Rome . His work on Diseases of Women , written for midwives , was composed in Greek , which was still the language of medicine in the reigns of Trajan and Hadrian . Soranus , a determined foe of superstition , begs the midwives not to make their practice dependent on their dreams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pupils were wiser than those of later generations . Soranus belonged to the School of Methodics , and Caelius Aurelianus called him " chief among the leaders of our sect " ( methodicorum princeps ) . There was little about the female genitalia that Soranus did not know , and after his description of the anatomy of the womb , there was no longer any excuse for confusing the vagina and the uterus . He popularized the vaginal speculum , and his obstetric chair or labor-stool was the parent of numerous offspring . Instead of hastening the expulsion of the fetus by manhandling the mother in the traditional manner ? shaking her , rolling her , making her run up and down stairs , or jolting her on a ladder ? he instituted gentleness in the lying-in chamber . He knew that // conception can be prevented by closing the mouth of the womb with cotton or ointments , that the os uteri opens during coitus and menstruation , that the woman conceives most readily following the menstrual period , and that sterility occurs in men as well as women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described all afflictions to which female flesh is heir , from the viscid vaginal discharge and excessive accumulation of gas , to hysteria and nymphomania . His pediatric section is noteworthy , and the minuteness with which he catalogues the qualifications of a wetnurse ? he knew that an infant may thrive at the breast of one woman and not of another ? must have gained for him the confidence of mothers . Medicine can not always divorce itself from patriotism , and Soranus preferred Greek nurses in order that the suckling might early become accustomed to the most beautiful of languages . No modern pediatrician is more meticulous about the removal of the vernix caseosa , the baby 's bath , clothing , feeding habits and bowel movements , teething and tonsillitis , than Soranus . If the infant had diarrhea , Soranus gave astringents to the nurse ; if it suffered from constipation , it was the nurse who took the laxatives . Soranus could diagnose the child 's condition from the varieties of its cries , and he even described baby-carriages . Living in Rome , he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a decoction of galls , they could reduce the vagina to virginal size ; it may seem strange that a man of his extensive experience , familiar with every detail of female anatomy , had never seen a hymen and was unaware of its existence ? but this merely proves that Martial and Juvenal were right . As a concluding refrain for the work of Soranus , we may quote this passage from Juvenal : " These poor women , however , endure the perils of childbirth , and all the troubles of nursing to which their lot condemns them ; but how often does a gilded bed contain a woman that is lying in ? So great is the skill , so powerful the drugs , of the abortionist , paid to murder mankind within the womb . Rejoice , poor wretch ; give her the stuff to drink whatever it be , with your own hand : for were she // willing to get big and trouble her womb with bouncing babies , you might perhaps find yourself the father of an Ethiopian ; and some day a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daylight , would fill all the places in your will . " Aretaeus the Cappodocian , a Greek physician of a Roman province in Asia Minor , described diseases in admirable Ionic . This one sentence is the complete biography of Aretaeus ; all else about him is surmise . Even the age in which he lived is in dispute , for Clio celebrates the birthdays of the destroyers , rather than of the healers , of men . It is a delight to read Aretaeus ; he is seldom superstitious , his mind is not heavy with befuddled theories , and he does not indulge in any of those mystical speculations which disfigure the pages of so many of his successors . No doubt the strangest passage Aretaeus ever wrote was his fantastic account of the uterus : " In the middle of the flanks of women lies the womb , a female viscus , closely resembling an animal , for it is moved of itself hither and thither in the flanks , also upwards in a direct line to below the cartilage of the thorax ; and also obliquely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or spleen ; and it likewise is subject to prolapsus downwards , and in a word , is altogether erratic . It delights in fragrant smells , and advances towards them ; and , it has an aversion to fetid smells , and flees from them : and , on the whole the womb is like an animal within an animal . " No medical author surpasses Aretaeus in his vivid portrayal of disease . When he describes consumption , we must not read the symptoms twice to make the diagnosis . We hear the hoarse chronic cough , the clearing of the throat , the blood and pus spat up ; we notice the sweats , the pallor , the cadaverous aspect ; we see the bony fingers , the thickened joints , the curved nails , the sharp and slender nose , and the prominent Adam 's apple ; we see the narrow chest , the lips drawn over the teeth , the muscles of the arm gone , the ribs sticking through the skin , the shoulderblades projecting like wings of birds , and the eyes hollow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hysteria and asthma have been especially praised , but his picture of satyriasis is as powerful as any : " Satyrs , priests of Bacchus , in the paintings and statues , have the phallus erect , as the symbol of the divine performance . It is also a form of disease , in which the patient has erection of the genital organ , the appellation of satyriasis being derived from its resemblance to the figure of the god . It is an unrestrainable impulse to connection ; but neither are they at all relieved by these embraces , nor is the tentigo soothed by many and repeated acts of sexual intercourse . Spasms of all the nerves , and tension of all the tendons , groins , and perineum , inflammation and pain of the genital parts , redness of countenance , and a dewy moisture . Wrapped up in silent sorrow , they are stupid , as if grievously afflicted with their calamity . But if the affection overcome the patient 's sense of shame , he will lose all restraint of tongue as regards obscenity , and likewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act . Raving with his obscene imagination , he can not contain himself ; tormented with thirst , he vomits much phlegm , and the foam sits on his lips as in a lascivious goat , and he has a smell like that animal . " Strangely enough , the author of the above had no knowledge of nymphomania , and even denied its existence . Yet he lived after Valeria Messallina ! In his writings we find the first satisfactory description of diphtheria . He is now famous as the author of the first systematic account of diabetes . He correctly called it a species of dropsy , and paints with realistic strokes the patient 's fiery thirst , his imperative desire to pass water , his dry mouth and parched skin ; it is a wonderful malady , he says , a melting down of the flesh into urine . Aretaeus seems to have understood the direction of the bloodflow in the veins ; if so , he knew more than the physicians of subsequent centuries . He distinguished between the paralyses of motion and of sensation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite side . He divided mental disturbances into mania , melancholia , and settled insanity ? not a 1 16 THE STORY OF MEDICINE bad classification . He described lead colic , and other disturbances due to lead poisoning . In obstruction of the urethra by vesical calculus , he employed the catheter . He removed stone by incising below the scrotum , and cutting inward to the neck of the bladder until there was an escape of urine and calculi . He deserves credit for his efforts to found pathology upon an anatomical basis . One of his greatest claims to our consideration is that he was the first to employ , so far as we know , the beginnings of inspection , palpation , percussion and auscultation ? the four features of physical diagnosis . He had few queer notions . It is true , in conformity with the custom of his age , he was too fond of venesection , but he always warned against excess of bloodletting , claiming it was better to err on the side of chariness . He believed castor was a remedy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would vanquish any case of gout . For this we must not blame him severely , for there is scarcely a practitioner who has not at least a couple of old standbys by which he swears . An idea of the nicety of his observations may be gained from a random passage ; in discussing methods of procuring sleep he writes : " Gentle rubbing of the feet with oil , patting of the head , and particularly stroking of the temples and ears is an effectual means ; for by the stroking of their ears and temples wild beasts are overcome , so as to cease from their anger and fury . But whatever is familiar to any one is to him provocative of sleep . Thus , to the sailor , repose in a boat , and being carried about on the sea , the sound of the beach , the murmur of the waves , the boom of the winds , and the scent of the sea and the ship . But to the musician the accustomed notes of his flute in stillness ; or playing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with song . To a teacher , intercourse with the tattle of children . Different persons are soothed to sleep by different means . " Here is a bit of psychology which every medical man will endorse : " This is a mighty wonder , that in hemorrhage from the lungs , which is particularly dangerous , patients do not deGREEK // spair , even when near their end . The insensibility of the lungs to pain appears to me to be the cause of this ; for pain even when slight makes one fear death . In most cases pain is more dreadful than pernicious , whereas the absence of it , even in serious illness , is unaccompanied by fear of death and is more dangerous than dreadful . " Aretaeus ' caution and scepticism may be sensed from these remarks on the treatment of epilepsy : " It is told , that the brain of a vulture , and the heart of a raw cormorant , and the domestic weasel , when eaten , remove the disease ; but I have never tried these things . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man recently slaughtered , and drinking a draught of the blood ! 0 the present , the mighty necessity , which compels one to remedy the evil by such a wicked abomination ! And whether even they recovered by this means no one could tell me for certain . There is another story of the liver of a man having been eaten . However , I leave these things to be described by those who would bear to try such means . " One of the mysteries of medicine is the absence of any Hippocratic reference to infection , although at least two of his contemporaries ? the historian Thucydides and the orator Isocrates ? wrote that certain diseases are communicable ; casual allusions to contagion are scattered in the writings of Lucretius , Virgil , Dion Cassius of Utica , Dionysius of Halicarnassus , Livy and Plutarch . The encyclopedist Varro visualized invisible infecting organisms , and according to Ovid : " Bodies rot on the ground , blasting with their stench , and spreading contagion far and near . No one can control the pest , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts do but injure those who use them . The nearer one is to the sick and the more faithfully he serves them , the more quickly is he himself stricken unto death . " The poet vividly indicated , in the magnificent description from which these lines are taken , that the disease passed from animal to animal and spread by contact from man to man , but the profession remained silent , still believing in atmospheric influences , and dreading miasma instead of infection . Aretaeus is the earliest 1 18 THE STORY OF MEDICINE medical author to allude to the doctrine , and was the first to distinguish between conveyance of disease by actual contact ( contagion ) and transmission of disease at a distance ( infection ) . There is a vague foreshadowing of endocrinology in this passage : " For it is the semen , when possessed of vitality , which makes us to be men , hot , well braced in limbs , hairy , well voiced , spirited , strong to think and to act , as the characteristics of men prove . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons become shriveled , have a sharp tone of voice , lose their hair and their beard , and become effeminate , as the characteristics of eunuchs prove . " There is another sentence which should be quoted , as it will arouse a response from every physician who has been called at the last moment or when there was no hope for recovery : " If you give a medicine at the height of the dyspnea , or when death is at hand , you may be blamed for the patient 's death by the vulgar . " What a world of reserve and dignity is in this simple remark ! The shoulders of Aretaeus the Cappadocian were broad enough to wear becomingly the mantle of Hippocrates . Many centuries ago Aretaeus knew the knack of driving a point home by a good story . Wishing to illustrate that the gout may intermit , he relates that a person subject to gout won the race in the Olympic games during the interval of the disease . And he closes his chapter on melancholy thus : " A story is told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with a girl ; and when the physicians could bring him no relief , love cured him . But I think that he was originally in love , and that he was dejected and spiritless from being unsuccessful with the girl , and appeared to the common people to be melancholic . He then did not know that it was love ; but when he imparted the love to the girl , he ceased from his dejection , and dispelled his passion and sorrow ; and with joy he awoke from his lowness of spirits , and he became restored to understanding , love being his physician . " Aretaeus shows himself a true physician by his concern and sympathy for the patient , in small matters and great : " InuncGREEK // Lions are more agreeable and efficacious than fomentations ; for an ointment does not run down and stain the bed clothes ? a thing very disagreeable to the patient ? but it adheres , and being by the heat of the body , is absorbed . Thus its effects are persistent , whereas liquid preparations run off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never bettered : " When he can render no further aid , the physician alone can still mourn as a man with his incurable patient : this is the physician 's sad lot . " In Glen 's time , the Syrian satirist , Lucian of Samosata , came to Rome in search of an oculist . Lucian was the wittiest sceptic of the ancient world , a warrior against superstition charging with unsurpassed Greek at the gods , pouring unquenchable laughter over the ghosts of his day . The question which Lucian asked of another , " What business had he to be the only sane man in a crowd of madmen ? " ? explains why Lucian 's exposure of imposture was foredoomed to failure . Lucian 's references to doctors and diseases are numerous , and his Life of Alexander the Paphlagonian is the classic chapter in the annals of quackery . Alexander was strikingly handsome , and according to Lucian , " while in the bloom of his youthful beauty , he traded quite shamelessly upon it . " In maturity and old age , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Trained by a medical charlatan , he realized that " fat-heads " ? to use his own descriptive expression ? could be shorn profitably in Aesculapian pastures . In Apollo 's temple on the Bosporus he secreted brass tablets , which were discovered to bear the information that Aesculapius would appear in Alexander 's birthplace ; at night , in the mud of the foundation of the new shrine , Alexander hid a new-born reptile in a blown goose-egg , sealing the breakage with wax and white lead . How he found this sacred egg and exhibited the nascent god to the populace ; afterward showed them a Macedonian serpent which he claimed was the fully-grown Aesculapius ; established an oracle and was consulted by all the world ; furnished mysterious answers which could be interpreted only by his own interpreters at additional cost ; set up a far-reaching espionage system in Rome itself , so // that he knew who planned to visit him and for what purpose ; how every trick was swallowed and every deceit added to his fame ; how he grew fabulously wealthy by blackmail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stoned by his orders ; how he increased his prestige during the great plague ; how Marcus Aurelius requested and followed Alexander 's advice with disastrous results ? are all matters which must be read in Lucian 's animated pages . Lucian , under an assumed name , sent a closed packet to Alexander ; he declared on the outside that it contained eight questions ; and he paid eight fees . Occupied with his followers , and rarely encountering unbelief , Alexander neglected his forged seals and heated needles , and returned eight meaningless answers . Lucian smiled as he received the replies , for he had asked only one question : " When will the villainies of Alexander be exposed ? " It was a rash inquiry , for when the deceiver learned that he had been deceived , Lucian narrowly escaped with his life . It is a sad reflection that it required gangrene of the leg to terminate the long and successful career of this necromancer . Medals from the joint reigns of Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus , in commemoration of Aesculapius and Alexander the Paphlagonian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , new Alexanders will arise and find new victims , for the disease of credulity is incurable ? yet the words of Lucian are eternal : " The historian 's one task is to tell the thing as it happened . " In the year 162 , a stranger entered Rome ? it was Clarissimus Galen ( 130-200 ) , native of Pergamum in Mysia , Asia Minor . Pergamum was celebrated for its shrine to the healing god , and according to Lucian , Jupiter complained that his altars were deserted since Apollo set up his oracle at Delphi , and Aesculapius opened shop at Pergamum . The school of medicine and library of Pergamum made even Alexandria envious , and the second Ptolemy , to prevent Pergamum from adding manuscripts to its archives , was ignoble enough to decree that no more papyrus be exported from Egypt . The Pergamenians took splendid revenge by turning the skin of sheep and goats into parchment ( perGREEK // gamena ) , and nearly all the extant classical manuscripts are written , not on papyrus , but on parchment . Pergamum gloried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything except Cicero 's name on the list of the proscribed , stole the entire library as a gift for Cleopatra . Galen , the best-educated and most gifted physician of the second century ? and of the centuries to come ? could not be content in the provinces or in fallen Alexandria . Aware of his power , and consumed with ambition , he hungered and thirsted for the center of the world 's stage . He longed for an opportunity to diagnose the disease of a senator or praetor ? and thus win fame and fortune at a stroke . Among his first patients at home was Eudemus , a peripatetic philosopher of renown . The wife of the consul Boethus was sick , Galen cured her , and received the consul 's friendship , four hundred gold pieces , and a reputation . A noble Roman matron , the wife of Justus , could not sleep ; her case baffled all the physicians ; but Galen traced her insomnia to her love for the dancer Pylades . It was not long before Galen became the most distinguished practitioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Galen did not accept the title with blushing cheek and downcast eye . The conceit which enabled him to say , " Whoever seeks fame need only become familiar with all that I have achieved , " was thick enough to protect him from embarrassment at any compliment . Not only did the boastful Galen praise himself unceasingly , but he mocked all his rivals with a scornful tongue ; he called them fools and asses , and told them they did not know anything . " I have done as much to medicine , " wrote Galen , " as Trajan did to the Roman Empire , in making bridges and roads throughout Italy . It is I alone that have pointed out the true method of treating diseases : it must be confessed that Hippocrates had already chalked out the same road , but as the first discoverer , he has not gone so far as we could wish ; his writings are defective in order , in the necessary distinctions ; his knowledge in some subjects is not sufficiently extensive ; he is often obscure after // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concise ; he opened the road , but I have rendered it passable . " Some figures of antiquity appear hardly human : the white-robed Plato , broad of brow and ever-thoughtful , slowly pacing down the shadeful aisles of the Academic Grove , seems more like a personification of philosophy than a man , but Galenus had qualities like our next-door neighbors . The leaders of Roman society requested Galen to establish a course of lectures on Anatomy and Physiology , which he gladly did , illustrating them with experiments on goats and pigs . The elite crowded to these demonstrations , and were pleased to be informed that they possessed more common sense than the physicians . At Alexandria Galen had been fortunate enough to witness two human skeletons , and he strongly urged all who intended to study osteology to go to Africa . But at his lectures a human skeleton was never exhibited , for the good reason that there was not a single one in all Rome . So bloodthirsty were the Romans of this period , that neither the populace nor the fashionables could enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sport , but they recoiled with horror at the notion of permitting a scientist to examine the murdered corpse . In this respect the Romans resembled a small and persecuted sect ? despised by Galen ? which was just rising into prominence at this time , but which was later to overrun all Europe and forbid dissection on the ground that it was impious to mutilate the image of God , and yet showed no hesitancy in crushing the bones or burning the bodies of thousands of heretics . The psychology of inconsistency is tragically interesting . For four years Galen resided at Rome , writing many of the works which have perpetuated his name : he worked as hard as he bragged . " There are many physicians , " declared Galen , " like the athletes , who would like to win prizes in the Olympic games , and yet will not take the pains necessary to gain them . For they are loud in their praises of Hippocrates , and place him in the highest rank among physicians ; yet never think of imitating him themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live // at the present day , and to have received from our ancestors the arts already brought to such a degree of perfection ; and it would seem an easy thing for us , after learning in a short time everything that Hippocrates discovered by many years of labor , to employ the rest of our lives in investigating what still remains unknown . " In the year 166 it was practically certain that he was to be admitted into the imperial court . Yet it was at this very time that he secretly left the capital . Galen claimed he so acted because he feared his envious rivals had decided to assassinate him . But the truth seems to be that he left Rome because an epidemic had come . Rome , with its usual intrigues , was bad enough ; but Rome , with an eastern pestilence added , was too much for the Pergamene physician . Galen was too selfish to die for others . In those days there were real plagues : this one spread over Europe , infected everything in its wide path , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the million , terrorizing the world into a mad-house and a morgue . Aesculapius must have been sleeping . Galen set his face toward home , studying all the way ; from the copper mines of Cyprus he collected medicinal ores , Balm of Gilead at Palestine , asphalt from the Dead Sea , and many drugs in Phoenicia . At last he stood once more in the fertile valley of Pergamum ; he remained there about a year . But the Greeks and Romans had a habit of recalling their famous sons almost as soon as they were out of sight . Half the illustrious men of Athens and Rome were exiled and invited to return . The emperor Marcus Aurelius summoned Galen to his side . Marcus Aurelius was at Aquileia , preparing to wage war against the Marcomanni , though he would much have preferred to be in his study , writing his Meditations . When Galen arrived in the camp , the flesh-fed plague was thinning the army , and the emperor and his soldiers fled back to Rome . On setting out a second time against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion , but the physician informed his ruler that in a dream Aesculapius had warned him to remain at Rome and attend the emperor 's chil124 THE STORY OF MEDICINE dren . And sure enough , little Commodus soon became sick , and Galen performed the doubtful service of saving a creature that became one of the most infamous of the hideous Roman emperors . But Faustina , the mother of the monster , was pleased , and she thanked Galen heartily , and crooned into the ear of her child that one day he would wear the purple . Upon the decease of Demetrius , Galen was appointed court physician , but he had considerable time for scientific work , as his chief duty consisted in preparing for Marcus Aurelius a costly treacle , the supposed antidote against all poisons : in the days of imperial Rome such precautions were not superfluous . In 175 Marcus Aurelius succeeded in subduing the fierce Marcommani , and returned to the capital . Of course a triumphant emperor must be feasted , and the Romans were champion gluttons with extraordinary alimentary canals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary stomach gave way under the endless courses . Poor Marcus needed all his stoic philosophy to keep him from groaning , and he sent for several physicians . A physician 's function is to administer medicines , and they did so , but their drugs did not avail . Galen was sent for , but we must allow him to relate the incident in his characteristic style : Hereupon I was summoned also to spend the night in the palace , a messenger coming to fetch me , by order of the emperor , just as the lamps were being lighted . Three physicians had seen him in the morning and at the eighth hour , and two had felt his pulse , whilst to all did it appear the beginning of an attack . I , however , remained silent ; then the emperor , perceiving me , asked why I had not , like the others , felt his pulse . I replied : Two have already done this , and from their experiences upon the journey with thee are better able to judge of its present condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel him , and as the pulse , taking into consideration the age and constitution of the patient , seemed to me inconsistent with an attack of fever , I declared that none was to be feared , but that the stomach was overloaded with nourishment which had been coated with phlegm . This diagnosis called forth his praise and he thrice repeated : Yes . // that is it , it is exactly as thou sayest ; I feel that cold food is disagreeing with me . He then asked me what was to be done . I answered him frankly that if another than he had been the patient , I should , following my custom , have given him wine with pepper . With sovereigns like thyself , however , I said , physicians are in the habit of employing the least drastic remedies , therefore it must suffice to apply wool saturated with warm spikenard upon the abdomen . The emperor replied that warm ointment on purple wool was his usual remedy for pain in the stomach , and called Peitholaus to apply it while he bade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded Sabine wine , threw pepper into it and drank , after which he said to Peitholaus that now at last he had a physician and a courageous one , repeating that he had tried many but that I was the first of physicians and the only philosopher among them . On fevers , and everything connected with febrile affections , whether ephemeral , bilious , putrid , hectic , tertian , quatran or quotidian , Galen was the chief fountain-head of wisdom . Regarding the plague , however , he had little to say ; perhaps his conscience was pricked , for he had only to open Thucydides to see how Grecian physicians perished at their posts during the epidemic at Athens . Such homely subjects as corns and callosities , burns and blisters , coughing and sneezing , a bruised nail , headache , toothache , baldness , bleeding of the nose , loss of eyelashes , wrinkles and freckles , Galen treated with sense and skill . He wrote good descriptions of jaundice , colic , dropsy , asthma , coryza , dysentery ; and on such diverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , erysipelas and emphysema , he was the chief authority . As far as we know he was the only one of the ancients who wrote a treatise on feigned diseases ; he wrote seventeen chapters on the pulse ; he was among the first to realize the importance of predisposition to disease ; he based his prognosis upon diagnosis ; he paid much attention to secretions and excretions ; it is claimed that his ophthalmic collyria could be consulted with advantage by present-day oculists ; he knew that phthisis was infectious , saying , " It is a matter of experience that those who sleep in the same bed with consumptives // fall into consumption , also those who live long with them , eat and drink with them , or wear their clothes and linen . " In obstetrics Galen did not distinguish himself ; Galen spoke of the two uterine cavities , the right for the male fetus , and the left for the female ? which leads us to suspect that he never examined a woman 's womb . Galen , however , did make some meritorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prolific writer on pharmacy ; he wrote so much about plasters that if he had been an ordinary worker he would not have had time for anything else . The preparation of medicines by physical means is still called galenical pharmacy . As a writer on materia medica he can not rank with Dioscorides , but he was second to him alone . It has been calculated that Galen 's materia medica consisted of 540 plants , 18o animal , and zoo mineral substances . Medicine is not an isolated branch of learning ; it is a part of general culture , and the therapeutic tree can not flourish in the soil of corruption . We get an insight into the temper of this period when we remember that the medicaments most in demand were cosmetics , antidotes , and abortifacients . The pure principles of Hippocratism were polluted by a variety of wrangling sects , while hosts of uneducated and irregular practitioners dabbled in medicine without restraint by law . The well-trained physician found himself in competition with the impudent quack . Everyone had secret formulas , and the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even physicians who had intended to practise decently , were forced to enter the mountebank 's booth in the market-place and advertise the wonders of their panaceas . Economic pressure caused medicine to wallow in the scum of intrigue and falsehood ? and crime . Hippocrates died in Thessaly , but six centuries later Hippocratism perished at Rome . Galen looked with scorn and disgust at his colleagues . He said that between the robbers and the physicians there is this difference : the robbers commit their misdeeds in the mountains , while the physicians commit theirs in the capital . Yet in the midst of this degradation , Galen founded experimental // physiology , made a vast number of discoveries , and wrote innumerable important treatises ? which proves that there must have been some intelligent physicians even at that time , because Galen was not the man to write for himself alone . But when we examine his pharmacology , we see that he did not escape the infection of the age . The Galen that turned toward Hippocrates , blamed Dioscorides for attributing too many virtues to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his contemporaries was a prop of rampant polypharmacy . He was an authority on hygiene , but he pandered to the fashions of the day by preparing complicated concoctions ? although we are duly grateful to him for inventing cold cream . Galen was a giant among dwarfs , but sometimes he stooped to the level of the dwarfs . Today , whoever speaks of anatomy , pays tribute to Galen ; the platysma myoides , says the modern anatomist , but this muscle was first named and described by the Pergamene physician . The frontalis muscle , the popliteus , the two muscles of the eyelids , the six muscles of the eyeball , the muscles of the spine , the muscles of each lateral cartilage of the nose , the maxillary group of muscles , with many muscles of the head and neck , both extremities and the body proper , were comprised in the Galenian myology , and in many instances the names which he suggested have been retained unto the present time . He divided the vertebrae into cervical , dorsal and lumbar , and gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He named the bones and sutures of the cranium , and knew the squamous , styloid , mastoid and petrous portions of the temporal bones ; the sphenoid , the ethmoid , the malar , the maxillary and nasal bones were familiar to him . In these descriptions Galen made few errors . The moderns have made little change in his osteology . The science of blood-vessels and lymphatics ( angiology ) was the weakest point in the Galenic structure of anatomy , but even here he built better than his contemporaries , for in opposition to the prevailing views of the age , he proved that the arteries convey , not air , but blood . He was the first to describe , with some // correctness , the aorta , the jugular vein , and the three coats of arteries . We are not in the habit of thinking that the capillary connection between the arteries and veins was known in antiquity , but let us not be startled at anything that we find among the Greeks : Hippocrates used the word circulation , though of course not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In De usa partium Galen wrote : " The arteries and veins anastomose with each other throughout the whole body , and exchange with each other blood and spirits by certain invisible and exceedingly minute passages . " His description of the thoracic contents is good ? except that he thinks the heart is not a muscle because it acts continuously , while all muscles alternate their work with rest . Galen 's contributions to neurology were noteworthy . He knew that the brain is the central organ of the nervous system , and that the spinal cord is an offshoot , but he made the mistake of thinking that the nerves of sensation arise in the former , and the nerves of motion originate in the latter . His method of demonstrating the brain was a masterpiece of minuteness , and he traced several of the cranial and spinal nerves with accuracy . - AIf the spinal cord , " wrote Galen , " be divided lengthwise from above downward by a straight section through the median line , none of the nerves going to the intercostal muscles are paralyzed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of those going to the loins or the lower limbs . " We agree with him that the motor fibers do not cross the cord , but we wait to hear what he will say as to the effect on sensibility ; but he was silent , and seventeen centuries passed before the answer came that a longitudinal section of the cord in the median line , while it does not interfere with motion , destroys sensibility . Galen made a series of cross-sections , severing the cord between each of the vertebrae , ? one of the most important experimental demonstrations of antiquity . Of all the old dietitians , and it must be remembered that the ancient physicians paid much attention to food ? Athenaeus being enthusiastic enough to remark that a good physician ought // to be a good cook ? Galen was the most distinguished . He stood high as a hygienist ; he was the man to consult on questions of baths and gymnastics ; his work among the gladiators made him . a leading authority on exercise . Galen regularly indulged in wrestling before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decide that walking and " small ball exercise " were more suitable sports for a philosopher . Galen trained Cornmodus , and the young emperor regarded himself as the incarnation of Hercules ? in his statues , Commodus wears the lion-skin and club of the Hellenic hero . He did not , however , wrestle barehanded with the Nemean lion , but from behind a secure screen shot his arrows at uncounted thousands of wild animals ; safe in impenetrable armor , and wielding the secutor 's sword , he fought in the gladiatorial arena against the naked retiarius whose weapons were harmless , and slaughtered an army ; brandishing the club of Hercules , he crushed great numbers of men dressed as sons of Earth , who before their death were permitted to pelt him with rocks of sponge . A veritable giant of sexuality , he prostituted hundreds of women of all known varieties , and perverted men and boys , from his leading senators and ministers of state down to young freedmen and slaves . It was probably in protest against the influence of Cornmodus , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exhortation to the Study of the Arts , Especially Medicine ? a vigorous address to students against the quest of riches , and the professions of gentlemen by birth , male prostitute and athlete . After quoting Euripides : " A thousand evils afflict Greece , and not one greater than athletics " ; and Hippocrates : " The extreme development which athletes acquire is deceiving , " Galen relates an anecdote about Phryne , the Athenian hetaira , about whom so many stories have been told . On one occasion , her lawyer , anticipating an unfavorable verdict , obtained her acquittal by exposing her bosom to the judges ; at the festival of Poseidon , casting off her garments and stepping into the sea with dishevelled hair , she served as the model for the Venus Anadyomene of Apelles , and the Cnidian Venus of Praxiteles ; Igo THE STORY OF MEDICINE acquiring riches by the sale of her beauty , she offered to rebuild the Theban walls at her own expense , provided she were permitted to inscribe upon them , " Destroyed by Alexander , restored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The story of Phryne appears apropos . At a banquet the game of " follow-the-leader " was inaugurated , consisting in each commanding in turn whatever he or she wished . Seeing the women 's faces painted with orcanette , white lead and rouge , Phryne ordered " hands in water of the finger bowl , touch cheek and wipe immediately with napkin . " She began by doing it herself . The faces of the others smeared with streaks were made repellent , Phryne only became more radiant ? she alone possessing a natural beauty without need of detestable artifice . As true beauty exists only apart from ornamentation , we will examine the profession of athlete to see if it possesses in itself some utility for the state , or for the individual . There are in nature goods of the mind and goods of the body . Athletes enjoy none of the former , since they are too ignorant to appreciate even that they have a mind . In the amassing of their great quantity of flesh and blood their mind is lost in the vast mire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid as that of brutes . Galen follows this with another passage which , with advantage , might be nailed upon every modern stadium : If by the will of Jupiter all living beings were brought together in harmony , and if the herald of Olympus called both men and animals to a contest in the same arena , no man would receive a crown . The horse would take it on the long course called the dolichos ; the hare in the stadium ; the antelope in the dialus . No mortal could enter into competition with the animals in quickness of foot . 0 light-footed athlete ! What a miserable showing you make ! A descendant of Hercules himself would not prove strong as an elephant or a lion . The bull would triumph over the pugilist and if the ass , adds the poet , was allowed to combat with his heels he would be a victor . In the learned annals of history then would have to be written that man had been conquered in the pancratium by the ass , and it would probably be recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ass ? the Laurel Crown . " // Galen was not always so discerning , as is apparent from these supercilious reflections : You would have me learn many languages , but I feel that it is enough to know one , a language which is so essentially singular and unique , and yet so suited for the use of all , so dulcet-toned , and so expressive of man 's human needs . But if you wish to learn the language of barbarians , you had better clearly understand that some of these resemble the noises made by swine or frogs , or jackdaws or crows , inasmuch as they are without form or grace , and unfitted for the tongue , mouth or lips . For some of these people speak for the most part from the depths of their throats , just as if they were snoring , or they use their lips and sibilate , or they pitch the voice , or speak in a dull monotone , or they speak with gaping open mouth and roll the tongue about , or else they hardly open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are motionless and inert as if they were tied to the mouth . And would you then neglect the Grecian language , so very pleasant and so expressive of man 's deepest feelings , a language , too , in which so much grace and beauty abound ? Would you prefer to acquire your medium of expression from methods of speech that are as unsuitable as they are ugly ? It were much better to learn one language , and that the most perfect of all , than to acquire six hundred debased tongues . . . . You do not wish , Sir , to learn the language of the Hellenes , well , be a barbarian if you will ... . I wrote these instructions not for the use of the Germans , nor for any other race of savage or barbarous men , no more than I write for bears or goats or lions , or for any other wild beasts . But we address ourselves to the Greeks and to those other peoples who , although by birth barbarians , strive to emulate the manners and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are most certain of their superiority . Little did Galen think that his barbarous Germans would conquer the invincible Roman Empire , and still less did he imagine that his chief editors and commentators would be German scholars ! Galen was an explorer , but the lands that lie beyond the seas did not interest him like the unknown regions of the body ; // he did not crave to discover distant kingdoms , for locked within the cranium he found ample treasures ; he blazed no path in primitive forests , but all through its winding labyrinths he followed the trigeminal nerve , slowly discovering the secrets that were strewn along its tortuous way . Galen adored the mechanism of the body ; he was filled with wonder at the perfection of its parts . He claimed that in writing anatomy he was really celebrating the Creator ; again and again the great Pagan physician breaks forth into paeans of praise : " In writing these books I compose a true and real hymn to that awful Being who made us all ; and , in my opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragrant perfumes offered upon his altars , as a thorough conviction of his unerring wisdom , his resistless power , and his all diffusive goodness . " An extract like the following illustrates Galen 's interest and delight in the body : " In the inner cavity of the larynx there is a structure of peculiar formation , which we have already shown to be the principal organ of the voice . It resembles the mouthpiece of a reed-pipe , especially when seen either from above or from below . Instead , however , of comparing the glottis with the tongue of reed instruments , it would be more appropriate to compare them with the glottis . For the works of Nature are both earlier in time , and more perfect in construction , than those of art ; and , as the glottis is the work of Nature , while the reedpipe is the production of art , it is possible that the latter might have been made in imitation of the glottis by some clever artist , able to understand and copy the structure of natural objects . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " In my view there is nothing in the body useless or inactive ; but all parts are arranged to perform their offices together , and have been endowed by the Creator with specific powers . " We regret that we can not share Galen 's convictions in these respects . Man is compelled to perform the lowest and highest functions in life with the same organ , and was it nice on Nature 's part to place the womb between the bladder and the // rectum ? St. Augustine was no physiologist , but he was vilely correct when he said that we are born between urine and feces . Teleology was indeed a rotten spot in Galenism . Wise Anaxagoras had said that adaptation to function disproves teleology , but Plato and Aristotle believed in design in nature , and Galen followed them , and erected the most elaborate teleological system ever known . Hippocrates approached questions with an open mind , but Galen came with his dogmas , and sought to make his observations fit into the mold of preconceived notions . His practical work was invaluable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthless . He wrote volumes of nonsensical assumptions , and seemed to suffer from an Asiatic imagination . It often happened that he was prevented from interpreting his results correctly because of his predilection for a priori reasoning . Hippocrates left medicine free , but Galen fettered it with hypotheses . Hippocrates related his failures , and used to say , " I do not know , " but Galen always imitated an oracle . " Science and Faith , " said Hippocrates , " aye two things : the first begets knowledge , the second ignorance " ; but Galen sought to mix the observations of Hippocrates with the metaphysics of Plato . Galen abhorred doubt ; his mind craved for finalities . Galen admired Euclid 's method of proving things , and he tried to make medicine as exact a science as geometry ; it is difficult to decide which was the greater ? the absurdity or the audacity of the attempt . In his system everything was explained ; everything was catalogued and tabulated . He answered all questions , he solved all problems . There seemed nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so it was . Galen was the last of the Greeks and when he spoke no more , the voice of the ancient world was hushed . Galen was the final star that shone in the twilight of antiquity , and when his effulgence was extinguished , there settled over Europe a darkness that was not lifted for many centuries . VI ARABIAN MEDICINE IN THE MIDDLE AGES AT the time that Galen kept on thundering in numerous treatises against empirics and methodics and other sects in medicine , Celsus wrote the True Word which , aside from a scornful notice by Tacitus , is the earliest literary attack on a new sect in religion ? Jews who called themselves followers of Christus . Galen , in one of his bibliographical lists , mentions an Epistle to Celsus the Epicurian , and Lucian dedicated his Life of Alexander the Lying Prophet to Celsus . Galen 's Celsus , Lucian 's Celsus , and the anti-Christian Celsus are probably the same Celsus ; he is therefore not the medical Celsus of the preceding century ? chronology may be dull , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second century Celsus is also of scientific interest , for Lucian refers to his " excellent treatises against the magicians . " Celsus , who regards the Jews as slaves escaped from Egypt , traces their origin to " the first generation of lying wizards , " and says they are " blinded by some crooked sorcery , or dreaming dreams through the influence of shadowy specters . " He accuses the Jews and their Christian progeny of practising magic , adding that Egyptian jugglers in the market-place can perform better tricks . Evidently , miracles are miracles only to those who believe them . After repeating the assertion that Jesus , the illegitimate son of the Hellenic-Roman officer Josephus Pandera 134 // and the Jewess Miriam , was raised in Egypt where he imbibed the black art , Celsus assails the doctrine of incarnation : " Why should man consider himself so superior to the ant and the elephant as to assume that God appeared in human form ? And why should God choose to show himself to mankind as a Jew ? " He compares the followers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a council of frogs in a marsh croaking , " For our sakes was the world created . " Indignation sweeps through ' his pagan blood as he says that , like all quacks , they gather their converts among women and children , slaves and idlers . There is no Lucianian laughter in Celsus . " I speak bitterly , " he declares , " because I feel bitterly . " The contempt of Celsus for the disciples of Moses and Jesus is profound , but fear creeps along the lines of his argument , as he pleads : Why renounce Hellenism for the fables of Genesis ? Why not adopt the philosophy of Plato or Epicurus ? Why be disloyal to Marcus Aurelius ? The fate of these polemics has been very different . The sects against which Galen contended have long been replaced by others , and the sect which Celsus tried to reason out of existence has long dominated mankind . Celsus ' book had little influence : his countrymen agreed with him , and saw no reason for excitement ; and those whom he controverted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of Celsus would have disappeared utterly , had not Origen , seventy years later , quoted most of it in his Reply to Celsus . Origen 's famous answer was written in 248 , when Rome was celebrating the thousandth birthday of the largest and longest-lasting empire that the world had known . The golden eagles led triumphant cohorts from the Atlantic to the Euphrates ; the legions that planted their standards in Britain , carried them across to Assyria ; the javelin which humbled the Danube and the Rhine , vanquished Ethiopia and Arabia . Yet that millennial celebration was delusional ? the giant who had fattened on the blood of all races was sitting at his own funeral feast . Generation after generation he was to shrink and lose his vital parts , until nothing remained of his earthencircling proportions except a wall . // In the year in which Galen bade farewell to the world , Origen was a pupil at the Catechetical School of Alexandria , the only academy of the time whose curriculum included Greek philosophy and the Scriptures . All his life Origen labored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Origen , a man of blameless character , was so much in earnest that he looked upon women as daughters of Satan , and to escape the call of the flesh , castrated himself . Origen 's eloquent argumentation that the teachings of Aristotle and Plato were not incompatible with the teachings of Jesus Christ , acted as a bridge over which antiquity walked into medievalism . After many years at Alexandria , Origen continued his activities in Rome , Athens , Arabia , Cappadocia and Palestine . Origen 's views on the preexistence of the human soul of Christ before he became divine , aroused resentment among his brethren , and often coming into conflict with the Christian authorities , he was exiled and excommunicated . He was certainly as sincere , and often more orthodox than the orthodox who anathematized him ? but from this time on , a new intolerance ruled the world : the ecclesiastical party which wielded political power was the only orthodox party , and in the name of God destroyed its opponents . Even the crimes of imperial Rome grow pale in comparison with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed over myths . Persecution on a wholesale scale began in the fifth century , with the advent of St. Cyril , the assassin of Plato 's last representative in Alexandria , the beautiful and learned Hypatia . No one could be more ascetic or orthodox than Nestorius of Constantinople , who cried , " Purge me , 0 Caesar , the earth of heretics , and I in return will give thee heaven . " Between the patriarch of Alexandria , and the patriarch of Constantinople , the doctrinal differences were insignificant , but their personal animosity being considerable , they anathematized and counter-anathematized each other . At the Synod of Ephesus they met for a trial of strength : each was accompanied by many bishops and armed slaves . The proceedings would have disgraced rival gangs of bandits . Cyril was the more cunning politician , and by means of // far-reaching bribery and criminal brutality , overthrew his antagonist . Nestorius , who had burned Arians and had hoped to exterminate all heretics , found himself proscribed as the archheretic of the age . It rarely happened that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other heretic-hunters . Nestorius retired to his monastery at Antioch , until he was banished to Arabia and ultimately to the Great Oasis of Egypt , attempting to console himself by writing a book on the Robber Synod of Ephesus . The triumphant St. Cyril had placed a sword in the right hand of his church and a purse in its left , and militant Christianity embarked on its career of coercion . Paganism was passing away , but the embattled Church needed enemies and victims . Men arose whose sole business was to destroy heresy , or to invent it if it did not exist . Thousands upon thousands were tortured in wars over words ; multitudes perished in metaphysical quibbles which were as incomprehensible then as they are meaningless now . The Nestorians , cut off from the prizes of power , were forced into fields of lesser rewards . It has happened more than once , that a race or sect , debarred from the politics of the day , found itself cultivating the healing art ? with the result that the most pious of bishops and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoons of heretics . The hunted Nestorians migrated to northwestern Mesopotamia , in the **30;451;TOOLONG town of Edessa ? where the Hittites were ancient before the Hellenes came . Here , in the Christian era , we meet St. Ephraim , the Syrian hermit , who learned to speak Coptic and Greek , not by study , but through a miracle ? according to his anonymous biographer . This saint had wandered far from his pagan fathers ; small , bald and beardless , he never smiled ; again quoting his first biographer : " water was his only drink , and his only food barley bread and sometimes pulse and vegetables . And his flesh was dried upon his bones , like a potter 's sherd . His clothes were of many pieces patched together , the color of dirt . " After him followed Rabbula , son of a heathen priest and a Christian mother . Rabbula did not // adopt his mother 's faith until converted by an example of miraculous healing ; as a Christian , he sold all he owned , left his wife and family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy man caused him to be chosen bishop , and he who had been silent on the hill-slopes now preached incessantly against heretics , especially the Nestorians . These men are of medical interest because Ephraim built the first large hospital in Edessa ; and upon the ruins of pagan temples , Rabbula erected an infirmary exclusively for women . It is thus apparent that Christianity early promoted the hospital system , but to claim it as a Christian invention is to forget the asylums of the Egyptians at Heliopolis , the iatreia of the Greeks , the valetudinaria and military hospitals of the Romans , the numerous and fully-equipped hospitals of Buddhistic India . In the Pali narrative , known as the Mahavansa , the great chronicle of a thousand years of the history of Ceylon , it is related that Duttha Gamani , feeling his earthly journey ending ( 161 B.C. ) , asked the records of his reign be read to him , and among the last words the dying king heard were these : " I have daily maintained at eighteen different places , hospitals provided with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infirm . " When the Nestorians arrived at Edessa , its medical school and hospitals were active , and in time the heretics gained possession of the orthodox institutions . Under Nestorian influence , Edessa was regarded as a second Athens , or another Alexandria . This exaggeration at least is evidence of the reputation of the school . The Nestorians prospered at Edessa , until Bishop Cyrus whispered into the ear of Emperor Zeno ; the lecture-halls were destroyed , and the bishop used the wreckage to build a church dedicated to Mary , Mother of God ? a vindictive answer to the Nestorians , whose heresy consisted in the belief that Mary was the Mother of Christ , but not the Mother of God . Expelled from Edessa , the Nestorians migrated to Persia , and in the medical school of Jundisapur they were destined to become the link between East and West . Admitted to Iran by // Cobades , they were welcomed by his son and successor , Chosroes , greatest of the Sassanid shahs . Chosroes ? of whom it is difficult to say whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Zoroaster , was severe with Persian heretics , but extended the hand of hospitality to foreign heretics . When Justinian closed the Academy of Athens , the seven exiled philosophers ? " the last of the pagans " ? found refuge with Chosroes , and when Rome purchased peace from Persia , Chosroes expressly stipulated , as one of the conditions , that these Greek Neoplatonists be permitted to live unmolested in the Roman empire . As man and monarch , Persian Chosroes was superior to Roman Justinian . In 532 , Chosroes , in concluding a treaty with this crowned thief , specified that Tribunus , Greek physician of Palestine , reside in his court for twelve months . At the end of that time , as Tribunus was preparing to leave Persia , Chosroes asked him what favor he desired . The physician pointed out some Roman captives , for whose freedom he pleaded , and Chosroes who was always despotic and generous on a large scale , liberated not only those named by Tribunus , but three thousand of their countrymen . Patron of Pahlawi literature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrigation , encouraging trade and agriculture , erecting cities from their ashes and re-populating war-stricken provinces , Chosroes did not forget to send his physician Burzuya to India to investigate medical conditions . Burzuya returned with the lore of Susruta and Charaka ? and the game of chess which ever since has been recommended as a method of treatment ? and this visit of good-will paved the way for the coming of Hindu physicians to Persia . Since the land that produced the Vedas in Sanskrit , and the land that wrote the Zend-Avesta , are geographic and ethnologic kindred , it may seem strange that their reciprocal relations should have been so vague ? but rival religions formed a frontier that could not be crossed . The chief period of Indian medicine is coincident with the rise of Buddhism and corresponds with the // classic age of Greece , and the parallelism between Hellenism and Hinduism is one of history 's disputed problems . By the Code of Manu the physician was not permitted to attend funerals , and despite such thrusts as " The food of the physician is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the physician for diseases , " Indian medicine produced these ethical and clinical observa-tions : To the sick man the doctor is a father : to the man in health a friend : the sickness passed and health restored , a preserver . Without practical training and merely by hearing lectures and by the repetition of discourses , a pupil is like an ass with a burden of sandalwood , for he knows its weight but not its value . He who knows only one branch of his art is like a bird with one wing . . . . He who is versed only in books will be alarmed and con-fused , like a coward on a battlefield , when confronted with active disease ; he who rashly engages in practice without previous study of written science is entitled to no respect from the best of mankind , and merits punishment front the king ; but he who combines reading with experience proceeds safely and surely like a chariot on two wheels . The physician , the patient , the medicine and the nurse are the four feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these are as they should be , then by their aid the exertions of the fourth , the physician , are of effect , and he can cure a sore disease in a short time . But without the physician the other three are useless even when they are as they should be , just as the Brahmans who recite the Rig-Vedas and Sama-Vedas are useless at a sacrifice with-out the Brahman who recites the Yagur-Veda . But a good physician can cure a patient alone , just as a pilot can steer a boat to land with-out sailors . The menstrual epoch is the most fruitful time for conception , for then the mouth of- " the womb open , like the flower of the water-lily to tilt- beams of the sun . Susruta 's instruction on the medical use of the five senses helps us to understand why the ancient Hindu physicians knew the sweetish taste of the urine of diabetes mellitus centuries be-fore its recognition by European practitioners : // By the sense of hearing we can , for instance , determine whether the contents of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such is attended with noise ; by the sense of feeling we may know whether the skin is hot or cold , rough or smooth , thick or thin ; by the sense of sight we can determine corpulence or emaciation , vital power , energy , and change of colour ; by the sense of taste we can assure ourselves concerning the state of the urine in diabetes and other diseases of the urinary tract ; and by the sense of smell we can recognise the peculiar perspiration of many diseases which has an important bearing on their identification . Their surgical armamentarium ? in which the hand figured as the first and most important of all surgical instruments ? was extensive , including knives of steel that could divide a hair , reedlike catheters , fluid-removing trocars , bone-dividing nippers , polypus-forceps , cupping-glasses , and one hundred-and-one blunt instruments ; when we remember that couching for cataract ? they knew seventy-six eye-diseases ? the surgical use of the lodestone , and plastic surgery , are Hindu discoveries , we can appreciate the pupils ' request to Dhanvantari when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain : " Teach us everything , but take surgery as the foundation of your discourse " ; and the aphorism of Susruta , the Hindu Hippocrates : " Surgery is the first and highest division of the healing art , least liable to fallacy , pure in itself , perpetual in its applicability , the worthy produce of heaven , the sure source of fame on earth . " The Buddhist king , Asoka , was the first great builder of hospitals for man and beast ; these animal-hospitals throw light on the Hindu injunction that the physician should refuse medical advice to criminals and to hunters who trap animals and ensnare birds . Buddhism is the gentlest and wisest , the most sceptical and scientific of religions ? and the only one that does not worship the sword ? and had it continued to prevail , Asiatic history would be different . But with the reestablishment of Brahmanism , Buddhist hospitals and tolerance were destroyed . The modesty which Charaka advocated , " Even the most learned physician should never become puffed up because of // his knowledge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boaster . And medicine is by no means easy to learn . Therefore let each one practise himself in it carefully and incessantly , " did not appeal to the Brahman who claimed a monopoly of wisdom and superhuman privileges . The priestly class fastened upon India the immovable shackles of caste . No man dare differ from his father , none may aspire , but in the groove into which he is born he must live and die . Only the Brahmans are righteous , all others are unclean . Under Brahmanism , Indian science stagnated and disappeared , and India with its swarming millions became the land of the dead . The last words of the Buddha are indeed true : " We are but transient guests , and all things pass away " ? but the memory of his graciousness lingers like the perfume of an eternal lotus-flower . No story in medicine is more tender than Buddha 's treatment of Kisagotami and her son . As is the Indian custom , Kisagotami was married in early girlhood ; she was young when her son was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was able to run alone , she was still a child watching a younger child . The beautiful boy died , and the mother , crazed with grief , refused to part with him . She carried the body to friend and stranger , begging for a remedy to restore it to life . All pitied her , and one said , " I have no such medicine , but I know of one who has . Go to the Buddha . " So Kisagotami sought out Buddha and rendered him homage . " 0 master , " she said , " do you know any medicine that will be good for my child ? " The Buddha shook his head . " Bring me mustard-seed " ? and the girl was glad he named a drug she could obtain at once ? " from a house in which no one has died . " She went into the first house , and when the people heard her request , they said , " Here is mustard-seed , take it " ; and when she asked if any had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is this that you say ? The living are few , but the dead are many . " She went from house to house , and one said , " I have lost my son " ; and another . " We have lost our parents " ; and another , " I have lost my slave . " She did not leave one house unvisited , and did not find // one where death had not entered before her . At last she understood , and brought the body of her child to a forest , and left it there . Again she sought the Buddha and rendered him homage . " Have you the mustard-seed ? " he asked . " 0 master , " she said , " the living are few , but the dead are many . " Under Chosroes the Blessed ( 531-79 ) , Greek , Hindu , Jewish , Nestorian , Syrian and Persian physicians mingled at Jundisapur , and Chosroes himself ordered Plato and Aristotle to be translated into Persian . The Nestorians became great polyglots , and , Jundisapur developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hippocratica of Asia . Chosroes passed from the scene , and in the following century the course of history was violently changed by an unexpected people . Savages rode out of the desert , and demanded the surrender of Byzantium and Persia . The Iranian monarch was amazed . " Who are you to attack an empire ? " he asked . " You , of all peoples the poorest , most disunited , most ignorant . " The messenger of the Saracens was unabashed : " All that you say was once true . The Arabians were clothed in the hair garments of beasts ; their food was green lizards ; they buried their infant daughters alive ; they feasted on dead carcasses and drank warm blood ; they slew their relatives and boasted of the property they stole ; we knew not good from evil , nor could we tell what was lawful and what was unlawful . All this is true no longer . God in his mercy has sent us a holy prophet who has given us a sacred volume which teaches us the only true faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftest in history ? and within one generation gave his people a new religion and a national consciousness , was Mohammed . A more ignorant and unscrupulous adventurer never twisted destiny . Greedy , revengeful , murderous and lascivious ? his harem increased with every victory ? such was the founder of Islam and the Arabian Empire . Had he been otherwise , had he attempted to raise the status of woman or abolish slavery , had he hesitated in shedding human blood , had he ever felt the power of pity , the turbaned horsemen of the desert would not have overridden three conti144 THE STORY OF MEDICINE nents in his name . The impulse for migration and invasion stirred the sands before the Prophet 's time , but he unchained fanaticism as he preached : " The sword is the key of heaven . A drop of blood shed in the cause of God is of more avail than much fasting and prayer ; whoso falls in battle , all his sins are forgiven ; at the day of judgment his wounds shall be resplend-ent as vermillion and odiferous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buddha , he was adroit enough to promise his followers a seventh heaven of many beds with a black-eyed houri in every bed ? a paradise of eternal fornication . After the death of Mohammed , his name on the lips of Moslems struck terror in Asia , Africa and Europe . All that Alex-ander had conquered fell into the hands of the Arabian , and where Caesar and Chosroes had ruled , a camel-breeder sat en-throned . The crescentade was invincible from the land of the Sphinx to the Gothic kingdom of Spain . The Mohammedan dominion then extended from the Mountains of Gold to the Atlantic Ocean ; Memphis and Carthage were taken , and from the streets of Cordova to the banks of the Indus the mosques were alive with thanks to Allah . The victorious Saracen laughed at Rome , he wrested Jerusalem from the Christians , and in disdain he sold the Colossus , for old brass , to a Jew . The Arabian Empire grew so unwieldy that , like the Roman Empire , it split in half : Bagdad on the Tigris , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eastern and west-ern caliphates , but the most important cities of the time . After the lust of conquest was somewhat appeased and checked , the Arab became aware of the medical school at Jundisapur , and reacted as had the Roman to the superior culture of the captive Greek . From Jundisapur , Greek science spread throughout the Moslem world . When the intellect of Europe was so clouded by monkish fables that the monasteries were buying milk purport-ing to come from the breasts of the Blessed Virgin , barbarian brown-skinned tent-dwellers became the saviors of Greek phi-losophy . For the conquering Mohammedans were conquered by the Greek manuscripts . Their bigoted insularity disappeared in // veneration of the Hippocratic aphorisms . No longer referring to all Europeans as unbelieving dogs , they pondered over the works of Dioscorides . As Athens and Rome now anathematized the pagan thinkers , Hippocrates and Aristotle and Galen left their homes , and far-stretching caravans of camels brought the parchments to Jundisapur and Bagdad . Aristotle , when his name was unknown in Paris and could not be pronounced at Oxford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samarcand . Upon the stage of history many tragedies and comedies have been played , but never a world-drama stranger than this : persecuted Nestorians , excluded from church and state , devote themselves to the science of the Greeks condemned by Christendom , and driven by Byzantine intolerance from their school at Edessa in Mesopotamia , transmit Hellenic culture to Persian territory at Jundisapur , where the manuscripts are translated into Syriac and retranslated into Arabic , until the Arabic versions with their extensive commentary become so influential in the Occident that they are translated back into Latin , and Europe for centuries acknowledges the medical supremacy of Asia ! It carne to pass that scholars in search of learning found it essential to acquire the Arabic tongue . Men who believed that Mohammed was able to put the moon within his sleeve , were at the same time men of science ? a seeming inconsistency which is not altogether unknown among other people at the present day . From Hindu mathematics , the Arabians derived the system of numeration which we still use , and developed algebra , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatise , al-jebr wal-mugabala . The Caliph al-Ma to built a Hall of Science at Bagdad , whose pride was an observatory where his astronomers watched the skies and not only measured the height of the atmosphere and catalogued the stars , but spoke a language not heard on earth before : Aldebaran still shines brightly in the heavens , and the Arabic names of azimuth , zenith and nadir , are permanent parts of nomenclature . They established the first pharmacies ; fostered the early steps of chemistry ; discovered nitric acid , aqua regia , red precipitate , corrosive sub146 THE STORY OF MEDICINE limate ; either introduced or popularized such important drugs as camphor , rhubarb , senna , cassia fistula , nux vomica , nutmeg tamarinds , musks and cloves ; observed that colchicum is bene ficial in gout ; and gave us syrup , juleps , alkali , alembic and alcohol , which terms are as Arabic in origin as muslins from Mosul and damasks from Damascus . The ninth century is the era of the Arabian Renaissance and Hunain ibn Ishaq ( 809-77 ) was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertile land between the Euphrates and the Arabian desert , once known for its good air and collection o poets , but in . his time already in physical and mental decay Hunain , who was a Nestorian , journeyed to Bagdad to dispense drugs for Yuhanna ibn Masawaih ( 777-857 ) , the leading Nes torian physician of his period . Yuhanna , son of the chemist to the Jundisapur Hospital , had come to Bagdad as medical at tendant to Harun al-Rashid , remembered for the piety which caused him to prostrate himself a hundred times a day , for hi patronage of the arts , for the elephant he sent to Charlemagne and as the hero of the Arabian Nights . Dissection was prac tically unknown in Moslem lands , but it is said that Yuhanna dissected the species of ape that resembled man most closely Of his numerous medical writings , his Alteration of the Eye i the earliest Arabic treatise on ophthalmology that has survived ? though any day the dust may be blown from an older manu script . The Arabians were acquainted with over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations . Yuhann ibn Masawaih was known to the Latins as Mesua Major , and Hunain ibn Ishaq 's Western name was Johannitius . Many stories of Yuhanna 's bad temper have come down to us , and his irascibility sometimes caused him to forget bot his medical and religious creed . " I feel unwell in my stomach , complained a priest who consulted him . " Use the Electuarium Susianurn , " said Yuhanna . " I have already done so , " responde the patient . " Use the Electuarium Diacyminum , " said Yuhanna " I have already taken some pounds of it , " he replied . " Use th Pentadicon " said Yuhanna . " I have already drunk a whole ves // sel full , " sighed the priest . " Use the Con f ectio Ambrosia , " said Yuhanna . " I have already done so , and in large quantities . " Yuhanna finally concluded the interview : " If you really want to get well , embrace Islamism , for that is good for the stomach . " Once Yuhanna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . He opened a sick eye and asked , " What are these rascals doing here ? " Naturally enough , they answered , " We are praying that God will restore you to health . " He drove them out with the retort , " A few pills will do more good than all your prayers , though they go on till the Resurrection . " On another occasion , he remarked to a bore , " If the ignorance with which you are afflicted were converted into understanding , and then divided among a hundred beetles , each one of them would be more sagacious than Aristotle . " Yuhanna accepted Hunain as a pupil , but being annoyed by too many questions , wounded him with the words , " What have the people of Hira to do with medicine ? Go and change money in the streets ! " Evidently , Yuhanna had not forgotten that he came from Jundisapur , for al-Qifti explains : " These people of Jundisapur used to believe that only they were worthy of this science , and would not suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their kin . " Hunain wept in the streets , but through his tears vowed he would go to the lands of the West and learn Greek . He vanished , and Yuhanna believed he had followed his advice and turned tradesman . Long afterward , Hunain returned to Bagdad , bringing with him his translation of the Aphorisms of Hippocrates . Meeting the Caliph 's astrologer , he asked him to show the version to Yuhanna , but not to mention his name . The quick-tempered Yuhanna was capable of enthusiasm , for after reading the translation he exclaimed , " This must have been written by the Holy Ghost . " " Not at all , " was the response , " it was written by the pupil whom you expelled . " Yuhanna , like a true scholar , begged to be reconciled to Hunain , and the two translators became co-workers . " I translated De ossium dissectione into Syriac for Yuhanna ibn Masa148 THE STORY OF MEDICINE waih , " says Hunain , " and I took pains to express the meaning as clearly as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this direction . " In writing of Galen 's De simplicibus , he states : " Later on Ayyub translated it better than Yusuf , but did not restore it as well as it should have been restored . After this I translated it into Syriac for Salmawaih and restored it as well as possible . The second section of this book had been translated by Sergius . Yuhanna ibn Masawaih asked me to collate and correct this section ; I did so , although it would have been better to translate it afresh . " A sharp tongue is not incompatible with longevity , and Yu-hanna reached the age of eighty . Upon his death , an Arabian poet was moved to satire : Verily the physician with his physic and his drugs , Can not avert a summons that hath come . What ails the physician that he dies of the disease Which in times gone by he claimed to cure ? There died he who imported and sold the drug , and he who bought it , And alike he who administered the drug , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased , it was inevitable that he should be presented at court . The caliph lost no time in telling him what he wanted ? poison for one of his enemies : riches for Hunain if he complied , and prison if he refused . After a year in prison , Hunain was again led to the foot of the throne : on one side were heaped gems and gold , and on the other lay instruments of torture . The caliph pointed significantly to one pile and then to the other . " Which ? " he asked . Hunain an-swered , " I have already told the Commander of the Faithful that I have skill only in what is beneficial , and have studied naught else . " The caliph nodded for the sword of the execu-tioner , and Hunain , feeling his last day had come , spoke : " I have a Lord who will give me my right tomorrow in the Su-preme Uprising , so if the caliph would injure his own soul , let him do so . " The tension was relieved by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunain , and was simply testing // his honesty . Such is the tale , and if any one can believe it , let him do so . A preserved fragment of Hunain 's autobiography complains that his fellow Nestorians accused him of being in the pay of the Byzantines ? his intimate knowledge of Greek gave color to this accusation ? and knowing he was an iconoclast they trapped him into insulting some sacred images , whereupon they imprisoned him , confiscated his property , and deprived him of the precious books he had accumulated during a lifetime of labor . But here too the legend-makers have been active with Hunain 's alleged prison-dreams and his liberation by supernatural intercession . What we definitely know about Hunain is that he was the greatest of translators , and if ever this useful guild seeks a patron-saint , no one could be more appropriate than Hunain ibn Ishaq . The Arabian passion for Greek manuscripts began before I-Iunain 's time . The story of John the Grammarian who asked in vain for the Alexandrian Library , and the Caliph who destroyed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Koran they are superfluous ; if they disagree they are pernicious , " belongs rather to fiction than to history , since even Moslem fanaticism could not burn what Roman and Christian had already burned . The accusation is true to the extent that it indicated the early Mussulman 's evaluation of the writings of infidels ? an attitude which underwent such reversal that the Saracen confiscated a copy of Hippocrates or seized a codex of Dioscorides as the prize of victory ; al-Mansur sent messengers to Constantinople for the works of Euclid ; Harun al-Rashid , in dictating terms to the defeated emperor of the Byzantines , specified Greek manuscripts as his most coveted booty . There were capable Greek translators into Syriac before lIunain ? such as the sixth century medical priest , Sergius of Resaina ? but Hunain 's versions of Plato , Hippocrates , Aristotle , Euclid , Ptolemy , Dioscorides , Oribasius and Paulus Aegineta , set the standard ; the little-known veterinary surgery of-Theornnestus did not escape his zeal ; he reviewed 129 books of          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
