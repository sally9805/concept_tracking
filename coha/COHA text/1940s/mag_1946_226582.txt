The inscription might be that of a deacon , grocer or Congressman : In loving memory of Tom Horn . <P> But Tom Horn was buried blue in the face , his tongue extruded , after the law had given him one of the fanciest hangings ever seen in Wyoming . Jay Monaghan does an excellent job of retelling the story in Last of the Bad Men . The gallows was an indoor affair , with a trap worked by a waterpower gadget . Tom had already made one escape from his cell , and was known to have rich and imaginative friends who might try to engineer another getaway . So the sheriff , taking no chances , held the hanging one day in November 1903 in a corridor of the Laramie County jail . Militiamen were posted outdoors . Tom was fitted with a five-strap leather harness , to keep his arms and legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for the event , were asked to sing his favorite hymn , Life 's Railway to Heaven . A minister said a prayer . Tom cracked a joke . Water trickled out of a tank ; the trap was sprung . <P> The Handyman . Tom 's trouble was that he had shot a few Wyoming homesteaders , and inadvertently admitted to doing in a 13-year-old boy . He himself was about 14 when he ran away from his father 's Missouri farm in 1875 . For the next couple of decades he bummed around the West , punching cattle , working on the railroad , acting as scout-interpreter for General George Crook and General Nelson A. Miles when they were chasing the Apache terror , Geronimo , up &; down the Southwest . Finally , he developed into a " range detective " and special handyman for big Colorado-Wyoming cattlemen . His specialty was dirty jobs . <P> As a group the big ranchers did n't like to have homesteaders messing up their range . They called them cattle rustlers , and sometimes they were . A wholesale attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the history books call the Johnson County War . Tom Horn had done his bit in this war ; he was cocky , range-wise , quick on the draw , an ideal trigger man . But off-duty he drank too much , and talked too much . One day in Cheyenne he boasted to a U.S. marshal that he had clipped young Willie Nickell , a homesteader 's son , at 300 yards . " It was the best shot and the dirtiest trick I ever done . " Hidden court stenographers were listening in the next room for just such a confession . The marshal swore out a warrant for Tom 's arrest . The sheriff picked him up in the lobby of the Inter-Ocean Hotel the next day . <P> Fact and Legend . Jay Monaghan , now state historian of Illinois but a former Colorado rancher himself ( in partnership with Historian Lloyd Lewis ) , says that Tom 's arrest gave Cheyenne and Denver cattle barons a bad turn . They retained a batch of lawyers to defend him , appealed his conviction to the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to the Boulder Cemetery in a high-priced white-satin-and-silver coffin . Author Monaghan knows the Tom Horn country at first hand , has talked to dozens of oldtimers who saw Tom in the flesh , has been collecting Tom Horn material for 20 or 30 years . A number of other writers , including Struthers Burt and Gene Fowler , have had their say about Tom . Last of the Bad Men ought to be the last word .
