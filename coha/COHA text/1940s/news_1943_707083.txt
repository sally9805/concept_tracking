txt FARM-LABOR FIGHT TO BALK PAY FREEZE IS URGED BY LEWIS Move to Win Agricultural Bloc Seen as He Asks Congress to Upset Roosevelt . Order HUGE WAR PROFIT CHARGED Mine Leader , Calling Inflation Inevitable , Demands Workers and Farmers Get Share Denouncing President Roosevelt 's wage-freezing executive order as " a false and unsound way to control inflation , " John L. Lewis called yesterday on all labor ' and farmers to support the coal miners in their demand for higher wages , and urged Congress to over , ride the President 's order with new legislation . In a press conference the head of the United Mine Workers declared that the Administration had permitted industry to make $6,250,000,000 in profits out of war expenditures in nine months , and that labor and agriculture should be allowed to get comparable benefits . Asserting that the United States Steel Corporation , whose financial reports he cited , controls through its " captive mines " the coal operators now opposing wage increases for his mine workers , Mr. Lewis insisted thaf the present scare compelled the miners to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To allow both sides to study the probable effects of President Roosevelt 's new order , all the coal conferences over new wage agreements were adjourned yesterday until 10 o'clock Tuesday morning . At that time the Northern and Southern soft coal producers will meet with the union negotiating committees at the Hotel Biltmore and the Commodore , respectively . The anthracite operators and union will meet at the Waldorf-Astoria . Dr. John R. Steelman , director of the United States Conciliation Service and President Roosevelt 's personal representative in the negotiations , probably will attend the Southern conference . It was indicated that Dr. Steelman 's field of operations had been clearly defined and limited by the President 's order , which henceforth permits increases in wage rates only in two cases  --  if the 15 per cent increase of the " Little Steel " formula has not already been granted , or if an increase can be proved to be " clearly necessary to correct substandard living conditions . " Since there is no dispute about the miners having already received a " Little Steel " increase , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question whether the cost of living , especially food prices , in mining communities is such as to constitute substandard conditions in relation to existing earnings . However , it was pointed out that wage rates themselves would not be changed by any agreement on a , guaranteed annual wage or by the adoption of the portal-to-portal system of computing wages , although in each case the total " take-home " pay would be increased . Under the portal-to-portal system , miners would be paid from the time they entered the mines until they left , which would add $1 to $2 a day to present wages . Mr. Lewis has proposed both the // annual wage ( to be based on present conditions with a six-day week and time and one-half for the sixth day , which the operators estimate would give the average miner gross earnings of $2,357 in 1943 ) and the portal-to-portal system . He has made it plain that he would be willing to accept a compromise based upon either of these plans , instead of his demand for a flat $2 a day increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . held ? at the union leader 's temporary headquarters at the Hotel Roosevelt on the request of reporters who asked him to comment on President Roosevelt 's Executive order . In his reply he accused the Administration of trying to make " the rich more affluent and the poor more despairing . " For the last forty-eight , hours , he added , virtually every radio commentator had laid stress on the point that the President was " seeking to drive a knife into the hearts of the miners and farmers through his alleged efforts to control inflation . " The order was " obviously " aimed chiefly at the mine workers , he asserted . Asked if there was any hope of reconciling his position with the President 's , Mr. Lewis said that the Executive order allowed wage increases to correct substandard wages , and that the miners ' wages were certainly substandard . " Whether the Administration will be willing to concede that fact is another matter , " , he added . " Congress , however , will surely assert itself , or the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignores all human considerations . " Discussing his " conservative estimate " that industry has made $6,250,000,000 in " profits , " Mr. Lewis said these profits were inflationary , and added : " Why not give the farmers and the miners a part of this profit that the Graces , the Lamonts , the Girdlers , the du Ponts and others of their ilk are taking from the public purse ? " Stresses Appeal to Farmers In an apparent move to win over the farm bloc in Congress , which is now said to be holding in reserve the Bankhead bill to raise farm prices , which President Roosevelt vetoed last week , as a club to be used in case the mine workers get their wage increase , Mr Lewis repeatedly linked the miners and farmers together against industry and finance . " The farmer and the miner , " he said , " are being asked to maintain a status quo , antebellum basis with no consideration for wear and tear and depreciation of human plant and facilities , while corporate industry is given ample allowance for maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lewis attacked both the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations for " cringing toadyism to the administration in power , coupled with blind worship of the astoundingly unsound economic policies of the administration , " in an allusion to statements by William Green and Philip Murray in support of Mr. Roosevelt 's anti-inflation policy . " The United Mine Workers and its membership , " he asserted , " will continue to make this fight for the millions of our population who are so obviously and understandingly in sympathy with our efforts . " He said the miners are only asking for a " square deal " and an end to " political persecution . " All workers should support the miners in order to protect their own future , he argued . The mine workers ' head came out specifically in support of the Bankhead and Pace bills to help the farmers , and the railroad unions ' demands for higher wages . He argued that it was impossible to prevent a certain amount of inflation in any war , and that labor and farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with the " inflationary profits " that he said industry had already received . Statement by Lewis The text of Mr. Lewis 's statement follows : The latest Executive order is linked to the so-called anti-inflation efforts of the Administration . The order comes belatedly after the fact of the arrival of inflation to a substantial degree ? inflation represented by increased cost of foodstuffs and living essentials and definite scarcities of many commodities due to war demands . Inflation to some degree is a definite concomitant of any war . War is a destroyer of economic and human values . It utilizes and destroys material of every character , virile manpower in the armies , while subsequent pestilence and famine decimate civilian populations  --  all of this creating scarcities and resultant higher values of remaining manpower and materials . To think now that a war can be fought of the magnitude of this globular effort without resultant inflation to some degree , is to fly in the face of history and all known economic facts . For instance , a Treasury report of war expenditures for the first nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for war effort alone . It is conservatively estimated that of this amount 121/2 per cent , or $6,250,000,000 , is profit to industry and finance . Obviously , this $6,250,000,000 profit is inflationary because it is utilized for expenditure by those who receive it according to their whim or caprice . Six , billion two hundred fifty million dollars profit in nine months represents the difference between inflation and nonlinflation in the United States of America . It represents the paradox of the Administration 's treatment of industry and finance as compared with agriculture and labor-23 , - 000,000 people in the agricultural population and 52,000,000 workers gainfully employed , performing tasks either essential in their nature or directly essential to the maintenance of the war effort . The economic position of the farmer and the miner at the outbreak of this war was very similar  --  the farmer as to prices and the miner as to wages were far below parity base level . The wage increase in 1941 to the mine workers and the increases which ' have come thus far to the farm population have been insufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other classes of American citizens . For this reason the mine workers are in full sympathy with the attempt of the farm population to secure compensating legislation in Congress , represented by the Bankhead and Pace bills , which have recently encountered administration opposition . Mine workers likewise are in sympathy with the 1,500,000 railroad workers in their efforts to secure increases . Some of the railroad men are receiving as low as 48 cents an hour . All of these groups were aimed at by the recent order of the President . I point out that his is a false And unsound way to achieve any reasonable control , of inflation . Twenty-three million on the farms and 52,000,000 employed in gainful occupation can not be restrained in their attempts to maintain a participation on an effective and cooperative basis in our national economy while the government pours $6,250,000,000 of profit in nine months into the laps of the coupon clippers of . America . A farmer or a miner is more important to the war effort and the future destinies ' of this republic than a fat investor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being asked to maintain their living standards on a status quo , ante-. bellum basis with no consideration of wear or tear and depreciation of human plant facilities while corporate industry is given ample allowance for maintenance of plant and equipment and $6,250 ; 000,000 in nine months of monetary awards for luxurious living or any other consideration . It is beside the point that other labor organizations such as the A. F. of L. and C. I. 0. , through their leaders , have adopted a policy of cringing toadyism. to the administration in power coupled with a blind worship of the astoundingly unsound economic policies of the Administration . The United Mine Workers and its membership will continue to make this fight for the millions of our population represented by their membership and their dependence on the farm and labor population of the country who are so obviously and understandingly in sympathy with our efforts . In doing so , we believe that we are contributing to the national welfare , protecting the destiny of the republic , and bringing home to ? the politicians of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War successfully by making the rich more affluent and the poor more despairing . It has been obvious that every move of the administration has been aimed squarely at the heart of the effort of the mine workers to receive consideration . I have ' been told that scarcely a radio commentator in the last fortyeight hours has not stressed ' the point that- the President 's order was seeking to drive a knife into the heart of the mine workers ' and the farm , population in his alleged efforts to control inflation . Success will not come to American arms through debasing and making chattel slaves out of that , part of the population that ' produces the food and materials essential to the conduct of the war , and the continuance of human existence . Calls Inflation Inevitable ' Asked to connect his statement more directly with the pending wage negotiations , Mr. Lewis said that it was obvious that the mine workers ' fight had emphasized the " acute inflation of prices that has already occurred . " He added it was " regrettable " that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue its efforts at control through devices and measures that have previously failed . " " Much water has gone . under the bridge since Leon Henderson , and now Prentiss Brown began ' their experimentation , " he continued . " They will not be able to roll prides back . Prices have never been rolled back so long as the economic compulson underneath has ' been enough to roll them up . The Caesars of Rome , the Byzantine Emperors and Kubla Khan all learned that lesson . The history of all human knowledge and all known facts attest to the insufficiency of feeble efforts of that , kind to control prices . " Repeating that the miners merely want a " square deal " and their share of the billions of profit he said industry has received , Mr. Lewis called for " an end to this political persecution " and " a halt in the attempt to make the ? miners ' claims pawns in the political marketplace . " Estimate of Profits Asked how he had arrived at his figure of $6,250,000 ; 000 profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by applying a " conservative estimate " of 12% per cent for profits to the $50,000,000,000 Tress-. urY Department figure of war expenditures in the nine months ending* April 1 , 1943. - Citing United States Steel Corporation financial reports for 1941 and 1942 , Mr. Lewis said he included in his category of profits not only dividends on common and preferred stock , but also amounts set aside by the corporation for special costs created by the war , for wear and tear on plant facilities , and so on . " If it is justified to accord such generous treatment to industry because of the war emergency , " Mr. Lewis went on , " why should n't the workers who are . now frozen by the Roosevelt freezing policy be entitled to similar allowances for wear and tear on their clothes and their shoes , which they need to do their work in . It is highly unfair to labor for the government to give such lavish rewards to industry and finance , while it tells labor that wage increases would be inflationary . " Mr. Lewis said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits ' for industry . " I want the United States Steel and all other companies to make a return on their investment , " he said . " We stand for . private enterprise and the right of capital to get a return on its ' investment , but we also stand for the right of the worker to get enough to eat . If sacrifices are called for , we 'll make them , but let industry and finance make equal sacrifices . " Mr. Lewis said the union would continue to fight for " a proper degree of consideration " when negotiations for a new wage agreement were resumed on Tuesday , but refrained from any detailed discussion Of his principal demands  --  a $2 a day increase ' in the wage scale , the portal-to-portal system , and the inclusion of ' foremen and other supervisory workers in the union . ? " All workers and farmers must stand for fair ' treatment for the mine workers in these negotiations , " he added , " if they expect to protect themselves in the future . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operators that there was no hope for an agreement and that the dis-. pute must go to the War Labor Board for settlement , Mr. Lewis said the miners were still hopeful of coming to an agreement by collective bargaining without further . Federal intervention . Charging that the United States Steel Corporation , which employs 30,000 men in its captive mines , has been dictating the attitude of , the operators , he said he did not think they would hold out in opposition to the miners ' demands much longer . ' Mr. Lewis said that in ' the last analysis , however , it was : up to the Administration to " accord justice to the - mine workers " by applying - that clause in the President 's order that permits wage increases to be granted to . correct " substandard " conditions . He added that he could not conceive that Congress would " long tolerate such a paradoxical policy as now exists . " " Parity is sure to be given to the workers and the farmers as against these huge industrial profits , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many letters " encouraging the mine workers in our position and declaring that our fight is the only real hope in an economy dominated by experimenting politicians .
