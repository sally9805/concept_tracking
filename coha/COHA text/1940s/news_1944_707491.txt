txt Governor Dewey , in his second annual address to the Legislature on Wednesday , is expected to recommend a series of benefits to be created by the State for disabled soldiers and for those discharged at the end of the war . It is not certain , as yet , whether the details of the plan will be included in his message on Wednesday , or will be left to program legislation emanating from time to time from the Governor 's office . In legislative circles , it is believed that the program will include some sort of a bonus arrangement , possibly on discharge , so that it can be used to tide the soldier over the period between reentrance into civilian life and his actual re-establishment in a job . Education and vocational training may also be included , according to reports . President Roosevelt has advocated such a program nationally and the history of Federal treatment of soldiers , in connection with bonuses and pensions , is such that no Congress would be likely to repudiate it later . The State followed the Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all that seems in doubt this time are the details of the arrangement to be made by the State . Old Bonus Law Ended While the State , as noted yesterday , will have a surplus of $100,000,000 at the end of the current fiscal year on April 1 , any appropriation made now out of that surplus for soldier benefits would have to be renewed in two years if not paid out by then , since , under the State Constitution , appropriations are limited to that period of time , and then lapse . The bonus provision of the last war ; allowing borrowing up to $45,000,000 for that purpose , was adopted in 1923 , and eliminated from the Constitution in the revision of 1938 . Revision of the present soldiervote system in New York will be another problem of the coming session . Virtually everyone agrees that the present system , which netted about 3,000 overseas votes in the last election and not more than 30,000 including soldiers in camps or on office duty in this country , is hopelessly inadequate for a Presidential election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his annual message , or he and the legislative leaders may await more definite action in Con-1 congress . It might be noted , in this connection , that there is nothing in the State Constitution which expressly forbids the waiving of registration for soldiers abroad , which would eliminate one step in the cumbersome process of post-card applications before ballots can be sent . Hospital Inmates Covered Section 2 of Article 2 of the existing law permits inmates of soldiers ' homes and veterans ' hospitals to cast absentee ballots , while Section 4 says that a voting residence shall neither be gained nor lost by employment in the service of the United States . The Governor and members of his staff have been working for the past week on the details of his legislative program , and the bills to be introduced to back it up . It is not , according to informed quarters , an extensive program , although it will contain , it is said , some matters of " significance . " This would be in line with the policy adopted last year , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried all items of it through the Legislature . In connection with taxes , the minimum program will call , of course , for the retention of the 25 per cent cut in the income tax instituted by the Lehman administration . There is scheduled also to be further simplification of the State income tax by having the State accept , as the amount of the taxpayer 's income , the amount he reported to the Federal Government . This plan was announced some time ago by Rollin Browne , head of the State Tax Commission . For many years the State and Federal Governments have exchanged information on income tax payers and payments , and the new move would promote simplification for both the State and the taxpayer . A series of corporation tax reforms , also announced by Mr. Browne , are expected to be carried through . There has been no recent word on the program of tax reform for the municipalities of the State and the reapportionment of the monies now shared by the State with them . A committee headed by Controller Frank C. Moore has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session of the Legislature .
