THIS is a picture of an average American business man arriving in Washington , D. C. , with his briefcase and his wife , to settle down and live there for the duration . They are people of substance at home , in a medium-sized town in the Middle West , let 's say , but strangers in Washington , where they become rapidly whirling cogs in the city 's vast political and social machine . If they are smart , their adventures in making a place for themselves will be gay and successful . If they make any mistakes , however , what will happen to them should n't happen to a cog . The male half of this symbolical couple owns a small toy factory in his home town and has come to Washington for any one of a number of possible reasons connected with it . Maybe he wants to keep an eye out for new contracts or straighten out some of the problems of operating on a war basis ; maybe he is supposed to watch after the Washington interests of his whole industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headache . His wife 's approach to Washington is different from his own ? to him Washington is a means , to her an end . She has dreamed of being a Washington hostess and she now thrillingly pictures herself presiding over a dinner party consisting of Evelyn Walsh McLean , Cissy Patterson , the British Ambassador , Cordell Hull , Mme Chiang Kai-shek , a Brazilian , and somebody terrific from the F.B.I . Together , the toy manufacturer and his wife are part of the 255,752 people who have increased the civilian population of Washington from 919,632 in 1940 to 1,175,384 at the last census , in 1943 . Everybody who is on his way to Washington to live is like a soul on its way to heaven or hell , crying , " What will become of me ? What will I find there ? " Both these queries can be answered in just one word : plenty . Most of the town 's quarter of a million new , wartime residents are there because they want something or other , and they go about getting it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some use personal charm , others start spinning like tops the minute they hit town and throw off continual sparks in the form of champagne-and-terrapin parties for senators , congressmen , and as many other influential guests as they can entice . The primary goal , for all , is social contact with powerful people , and it is generally attempted by one of two methods . The first is the dignified social campaign , which is generally used by newcomers like our couple from the Middle West ? whom we shall now call Mr. and Mrs. Toy , for the purposes of this piece . The second is the hot-damn , razzmatazz attack , and this is mainly employed by wealthy and daring business men who wish to attract  | the attention of other men or bodies of men for business reasons . WASHINGTON is not an unfriendly town . It embraces every new arrival with all the warmth of a cop frisking a suspect for concealed weapons , and it drops him just as quickly if he is unarmed . Washingtonians like a person to have a few tricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish oversimplicity . They tell a sad little story about Donald Nelson , when he first arrived to take charge of the WPB . It seems that a couple of old friends of his were living in town , and he innocently looked them up . They dined together and he met some of their friends and later asked them to dinner . Well , sir , it turned out that the old pals and their crowd were strictly nobodies , and " before the poor man could do anything to save himself " ? to quote the horrified Washingtonians who tell this tale --  " there he was , in with the wrong people forever . " Mr. Nelson has managed to rise above this early faux pas , since ability counts for a good deal in wartime Washington , and his position is happily now so secure that he can dine with practically anyone he pleases , without reverberations . For any lesser folk , though , it is better to be dead in Washington than to know the wrong people , and our Middle Western couple , Mr. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they know nobody at all . They are quite definite about the people they want to know . Mr. Toy wants , first of all , to get in touch with that fellow in the government agency who can get him his contract clearance , his priority , or perhaps just a kind word ? whatever it is he happens to need . Just for the hell of it , Mr. Toy would also like to meet J. Edgar Hoover . His wife 's desires are fancier , of course . She wants to become really friendly with Mrs. Stotesbury , Mrs. McLean , Lady Halifax , and Mme Carlos Martins , the brilliant wife of the Brazilian Ambassador ; and naturally she would like to be asked to the White House to dine . It 's safe to say that Mr. Toy 's dreams will come true before his wife 's do . Nothing is simpler than getting in touch with a fellow in a government agency ? not the head man , perhaps , but a middleman who turns out to be a gentleman , possibly even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having all the time in the world at his disposal . Sometimes it takes all the time in the world to get the business concluded ( why do you suppose people go to live in Washington ? ) , but the preliminaries are pleasant and include many a chat about mutual acquaintances , maybe a new-found bond in the form of an old prep school or college , and often a friendly drink at a nearby bar . As for J. Edgar Hoover , he is equally democratic and approachable , although he remains a good deal of a mystery to many people . He is a bachelor , for one thing , and bachelors are always mysterious ? to women , who ca n't imagine how they ever resisted , and to men , who ca n't figure out how they managed to escape . Hoover lives in a small house in Washington 's northwest district and usually dines at Harvey 's sea-food restaurant alone with his assistant , Clyde Tolson , or occasionally with whatever friends he happens to be entertaining . His dinner is frequently interrupted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each approach Hoover rises , blushes slightly , and murmurs , " Thank you . Many thanks . " On his visits to New York , Hoover likes to eat at Lindy 's or the Stork Club , where he can find the company he likes best ? theater people and newspapermen . He is fond of people in those professions partly because they are good companions and partly because his own early ambition , he once told a friend , was to become either an actor or a reporter . Newspapermen revere Hoover and sometimes follow him around as eagerly as small boys after Dick Tracy . One time in New York Louis Sobol , the columnist , came upon Hoover and Tolson apparently conferring upon something of importance . Sobol , who knows them both , rushed up to them excitedly . " Something in the wind ? " he whispered . Hoover smiled quietly and Tolson looked enigmatic . " Want to come along ? " Hoover asked . " You bet , " breathed Sobol.  | " Okay , " said Hoover , " but remember ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw it . " The three men got into Hoover 's bulletproof car and were driven swiftly for a distance of about fifteen blocks . Neither of the G-men spoke , and Sobol wondered a little nervously what awaited them at the end of the journey . At a point near West Fiftieth Street the car stopped and Hoover and Tolson got out and walked briskly across the sidewalk , looking neither to the right nor to the left . Sobol , his eyes fastened to their backs , followed them out of the car , across the pavement -- and into a newsreel theater . II FORMAL Washington society ? the group that Mrs. Toy has her eye on ? is far more complicated and tricky than funloving Edgar and his pals . It does not revolve , even dimly , around the White House ? that is one of the first jolts that Mrs. Toy will receive . Another surprise for her will be the continual friendly warnings people will give her about practically everything . If you 're asked to the Chinese Embassy , they will tell her , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present Ambassador , Dr. Wei , and his wife do n't always see eye to eye with the Chiangs . If you sit next to an admiral or a general or a Supreme Court justice or any man in public office at dinner , and he tells you a good story , retell it later if you like but never , never quote him as having told it in the first place , no matter how innocent the story is ; the proper phrase to use in quoting it is , " There 's a story going around town . . . " . Never ( the friendly advice continues ) say anything over a telephone you do n't want everybody to know ? it 's a clich6 that Washington 's occupational disease is fear of tapped wires . Not that most people do n't know their wires are being tapped ? they do . In fact ( the informants go on to say ) it 's well known that the telephone company 's own switchboards are sometimes clogged by calls from people in high public office demanding , " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One feminine newcomer listened wideeyed to all these warnings about what not to do and say , and then asked timidly , " If I should be invited to the White House , what can I talk about there ? " The old Washingtonian who had been advising her gave a tolerant laugh and replied , " Oh , at the White House you can say practically anything ! " To understand the role the White House plays ? or does not play ? in Washington society , it is first necessary to understand Washington society . This is a little like understanding a beehive or an ant palace . Perhaps Washington society can best be compared to the concentric ripples made by a stone dropped in water . At the core are the cave-dwellers , changeless and impenetrable with few exceptions . One feminine outlander aptly describes the cave-dwelling sisterhood as " the kind of women who wear their hats to breakfast in their own houses . " The first outward circle comprises Cabinet members , Supreme Court justices , and State Department people , who keep themselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and hard , and the men are too tired to go out much at night . Many government men often work in their offices past the dinner hour , and their idea of a treat and a relaxation is sometimes surprising . One night not long ago , Under Secretary of War Robert Patterson found his Assistant Secretary for Air , Robert A. Lovett , still toiling at his desk around eight-thirty and spoke to him benevolently . " You 've had a tough day , Bob , and you deserve a good , bangup dinner . Come on , and I 'll blow you to one , " he said . Outside , Patterson hailed a taxi and the two men drove off companionably to the nearest Childs 's . THE second circle in the social pool is occupied by the embassies and the diplomatic crowd and is extremely gay . The ambassadors of nations at war exert themselves to make friends , these days , because of their countries ' needs . Even the traditionally stiff British Embassy unbent this year far enough to electrify the Women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be invited to the club 's annual luncheon . ( She came , sat next to the guest of honor , who hap- pened to be a lady welder , and they both had a fine time . ) The Latin-American embassies whose countries are not at war are more vivacious than ever , and the greatest party-lovers of all the embassy people are the Russians . This is a wistful fact in a way , because Washington has not yet apparently been able to connect the Soviets with gaiety and they are sometimes left out of the fun . " They are like children , " a White Russian in Washington once said sympathetically . " They love champagne and music and beautiful women just as children love ice cream and cake at a party . What if they sing loud and holler a little ? It 's better to have them holler with us than at us . A few good parties for the Soviets in Washington , " this old-school Russian concluded , " would help Russian-American relations more than fifty official calls on Stalin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not so timid as they are canny , and that they are afraid too many parties for the Russians may link them up to another Party , with a capital P. Whatever the reason , the Russians are lonesome . The third social circle consists of government appointees and people in government agencies , a good many of whom are New Yorkers and therefore notoriously clannish and inclined to go around with other people from New York . They are lively and amusing , but are considered a little too self-sufficient . One New Yorker outraged old Washingtonians recently by remarking that he would be glad to join a certain country club if it would put in a swimming pool and some decent tennis courts . " Glad to join ' indeed ! Why he could n't get in , in a million years ! " the cave-dwellers boomed when they heard about it . The outsider then further irritated them by joining the club the very next week . According to the wife of one government agency man , there is a sensible reason for people connected with WPB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch with their own group : a good wife likes to be charming to her husband 's boss , and the heads of government agencies are shifted so rapidly that , if the wife does n't keep her finger continually on the agency pulse , she is apt to find herself wasting her charm on some guy who has been out of office for a couple of weeks . The fourth circle is Army , Navy , and Marines , each of which is fairly faithful to its own , its members entertaining one another and enjoying private , intramural jokes . One laugh that later became less private occurred last summer at a dinner party at the home of Lieutenant General Thomas Holcomb , former commandant of the Marine Corps . At one end of the Holcombs ' dining room hangs a rather forbidding portrait of the late Colonel Archibald Henderson , the first commandant of the U. S. Marines . On this particular evening the Holcombs ' son had brought a pretty girl to dinner , and at some point in the conversation General Holcomb turned to her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help the war effort ? " The lovely young thing looked up brightly and said , " Why , I 'm joining the Marine Corps . " At this the portrait of Colonel Henderson fell from the wall with a crash , demolishing a porcelain tea service that had sat on a table below it . When the portrait was picked up , General Holcomb later remarked , it seemed to everyone present that Henderson 's piercing eyes looked wild . The visiting young lady nervously thought he had fallen from the wall in a faint at the notion of women joining the Marines , but the Holcombs interpret the whole thing as a hearty and welcoming gesture from the first commandant toward all recruits , male and female . The tea service he smashed on the way down , they point out , was made in Japan . The fifth and outermost social ripple is a desperate swirl containing the people who , like Mr. and Mrs. Toy , have come to Washington to get something . ( If I have left out any group , or groups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this whole conception of Washington society will probably be challenged in any case . ) Looking down on the social pool , but untouched by the ripples , stands the White House . The fact that formal entertaining has been canceled there for the duration is not the only reason that the  | White House remains detached from the general hullabaloo . It has been that way ever since the Harding administration . Harding was handsome and jovial and his wife was ambitious , and both were truly impressed by Washington society . They had no desire to reproduce any part of Marion , Ohio , in the drawing rooms of the White House . Old Washingtonians naturally found this respectfulness endearing , and the Hardings were great social successes . Coolidge , on the other hand , cared about as much for Washington society as one of the angleworms he used to fish with , and Mrs. Coolidge was a schoolmarm , gracious but plain . Besides , both of them breathed New England and were obviously alien to the banks of the Potomac . In the same way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to surround themselves with their California friends . As for the Roosevelts , they are clearly New York people , fond of the company of other people from New York ? so much so that certain old residents of Washington ( even older residents than Mr. Roosevelt , that is ) have been heard to remark coldly that you never meet anyone at the White House nowadays except New Yorkers and Hollywood actors . These critics like to affect gloom at the prospect of dining at the White House , on the rare occasions when they are asked to dinner . " Turkey and candied yams again , I suppose , " they mutter . They accept with a politeness that amounts to alacrity , however . " Is n't it interesting , " a dirty New Yorker once said to his White House dinner partner , a simmering cave-dweller , " how much more delicious turkey and candied yams are than sour grapes ? " SO THERE you have a rough picture of the social enigma of Washington , with the White House a little beyond the outermost ripple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the pool 's very center . Obviously there is right on both sides . The government ca n't help being the most important thing in Washington , and Washington cave dwellers ca n't help thinking that they ought to be the most important thing in their own town . It 's a little like a time I remember when some city fishermen exhibited a giant turtle on the village green in Easthampton , Long Island . The villagers inspected it , tolerated it , and finally resented it as attracting too damn much attention . III Like any other socially ambitious newcomer , Mrs. Toy would like to move immediately into the embassy circle and pass from there into the more powerful Cabinet group . To accomplish these aims she must know the right people , and the right people are found , of course , only in the right places . Washington 's most correct residential districts are Massachusetts Avenue , where most of the embassies are ; Arlington across the bridge ; or Georgetown , the one-time Negro colony whose old brick houses are now occupied by such celebrities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Francis Biddies , and Mrs. Edward B. McLean . The newcomer whose husband can afford it ( and if he ca n't , she 'd better stay home ) can rent a small furnished house in Georgetown for about four hundred dollars a month . Once established at a proper address the best way for her to get to know helpful people is via the Good Works Route ? war work at the local Red Cross or A.W.V.S. or committee work for local charities . If she is attractive or a hard worker , or both , the other women in these organizations will presently ask her to lunch at the Sulgrave Club or at 1925 F Street ? the town 's two choosiest women 's clubs ? and one of them will probably propose her for membership in one or the other . The girls will also help her to place her children in the right schools ? the boy in St. Albans , the Landon School , or the Episcopal School , the girl in the Cathedral School , Madeira , or Holton Arms , and both kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her new friends her husband will be put up for a good golf club , such as Grasslands , Burning Tree , or Columbia , and he will learn to smile tolerantly at the local gag about Columbia 's membership consisting so largely of business men that the club ought to have a sign over the front door  | reading " Tradesmen 's Entrance . " Eventually the Toys , like any newly arrived couple , hope to join Chevy Chase . The usual waiting time for membership there is five years but one dashing couple from Baltimore actually managed , through somebody they met at an embassy tea , to get in after only six months . The newcomers will be asked out a good deal and will give in return one large party ( with the aid of a social secretary ) and a series of small dinners , increasingly select . If they know what 's good for them they will never act overconfident at first , no matter how swimmingly things appear to be going . One hapless wench who later disappeared from social ken was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent of announcing that everyone in Washington had been so lovely to her that she had decided to call all her new friends by their first names . " Which is your first name ? " she demanded of Dr. Hu Shih , then Chinese ambassador , who happened to be present . " Well , " the Ambassador replied gently , " you ca n't very well call me Who , and it might sound silly to call me She , so perhaps you had better just continue to call me Dr. Hu Shih . " The only thing worse than overconfidence , in a stranger , is panic . A certain new and frazzled hostess came apart publicly in a pitiful way at her own soiree , when most of the more exalted guests failed to arrive . Around midnight , when one of the women who had come went to bid her good-night , this hostess stared at her wildly and wailed , " Do n't speak to me ! Not a single soul I wanted has showed up ! " A STRANGE and peculiar accolade for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties at Friendship , and Mrs. McLean extends or withholds this boon as impulsively as you might tease a kitten with a spool on a string . She dropped the lovely Congresswoman Clare Boothe Luce for a while after Miss Boothe had had a misunderstanding with the local newspaper women which resulted in their waiting for her at Union Station while she ducked out of a back door . Miss Boothe is a suave and decorative guest , however , and she has been recalled to favor . One night , not long ago , she was dining at Friendship and happened to be seated where her eyes could rest in turn upon her husband , Henry Luce ; John L. Lewis ; and Supreme Court Justice Frank Murphy . " Interesting , " Miss Boothe murmured at length to Mrs. McLean ; " we have , together in this one spot , the three most famous pairs of eyebrows in America . " At Mrs. McLean 's smaller parties , meaning those of not more than a hundred people or less than fourteen , John L. Lewis is a frequent guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. McLean likes excitement and , at her famous Sunday-night suppers , often enjoys placing mortal enemies across the table from each other and close enough to herself to set the Hope diamond on her bosom to bouncing in anticipation of a good fight . The mortal enemies sometimes disappoint her . Cissy Patterson and John L. Lewis , it 's true , obliged by exchanging a few sharp words when they found themselves vis-a-vis at Friendship 's board one night while the Patterson-McCormick papers were busy taking Mr. Lewis to the cleaners . But when Mrs. McLean expectantly placed Lord Halifax , the British ambassador , opposite Hjalmar Procope , the former Finnish minister , the night after Finland joined up with Germany , neither gentleman so much as took a swipe at the other . Mrs. McLean is undoubtedly the referee of Washington society , but Mrs. Edward T. Stotesbury is probably its queen . The burden of this honor is lightened for her by the colorful doings of her daughter , Mrs. Louise **39;292;TOOLONG . The fourth marriage of the former Mrs. Atwill , who was once General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this spring and was a lively social event . The bride wore red , at least here and there , and the orchestra played " I Would Be True , for There Are Those Who Love Me , " and " The Old Refrain . " People are naturally curious about Mrs. Heiberg 's life with General MacArthur , and she answers their questions calmly . " Did he ever try to dominate you in an autocratic , military sort of way ? " a friend asked her recently . " Yes , but he did n't  | get very far with it , " she replied , " I used to just hit him over the head with something and he saw stars -- -four of them . " In Washington , as in other cities , you sometimes hear an unfamiliar name so constantly repeated that you finally ask , " Who is this dame I keep hearing about ? " This is fame , or the prelude to it . The owner of such a name right now is Mrs. Morris Cafritz , the wife of a wealthy Washington real-estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgetown has the signs of the zodiac inlaid in gold on the vestibule floor , murals everywhere , and a glass dance floor in the playroom , lighted from underneath . It has none of the elegant dowdiness esteemed by polite Washingtonians , but they respect it as an unmistakable eyeful . Mrs. Cafritz , Hungarian born , has the social and political awareness that European girls acquire before American girls of the same age have got the braces off their teeth , and she is a successful hostess partly because she has made a career of it and partly for a more unexpected reason . " What I like about Gwen Cafritz , " one hard-boiled Washingtonian has said , " is that she makes absolutely no pretense at not being elaborate . " THESE , then , are some of the women our Mrs. Toy must woo , and compete with , in her Washington campaign . Winning them over , and possibly even winning out over them , depends mainly on her own personality and wit . The old devices , such as snaring visiting royalty as social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting royalty is British or otherwise impeccable . Archduke Otto of AustriaHungary is the boy who innocently hung the crepe on this custom last time he was in Washington . Otto would go anywhere , and consequently soon became worthless as a social prize . Besides , the local food and wine so entranced him that he always stayed too long . Protocol is not as rigid as it was before the war but most people still hesitate to leave a party before the royal guest departs , and night after night would find Otto relaxing , stuffed and rosy , while weary Cabinet members propped their eyes open and hopelessly tried to signal their wives . Former Secretary Woodring is said to have ended the dilemma one midnight when he marched up to his hostess , made his excuses , bowed to the Archduke , and firmly left . Royal names lost their ring after that . Nowadays , when a Cabinet member begins to nod in his own living room , his wife just murmurs " Otto ! " and the Cabinet member pulls himself together and goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , social attack on Washington ? as opposed to the dignified social campaign ? has been well described in the newspaper accounts of the antics of John P. Monroe , the Man with the House on R Street , and of William S. Jack , president of Jack &; Heintz , Inc. , the Cleveland manufacturing plant which now turns out airplane parts under a government contract . Their method of approach is the only point of similarity between these two gentlemen . Monroe , who comes from Boston , has always been a man of mystery , whereas Bill Jack , as he is chummily called , is about as mysterious as a brass band . Monroe , it will be remembered , was summoned before the House Military Affairs Committee last year to explain his connection with the business of obtaining war contracts and just how closely it concerned the famous parties he was giving for government , Army , and Navy officials at the house he had rented on R Street . Washington was a little nervous about contract brokers , some of whom were known to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the preceding year . Monroe was discharged for lack of evidence , but his hearing almost certainly hurried the formation of the War Contracts Renegotiation Committee ? the outfit which later caused considerable anguish to President Jack of Jack &; Heintz . Part of the mystery that surrounded the House on R Street ? aside from its name , which sounds like the title of a thriller ? was the fact that the glittering celebrities Monroe invited to his parties actually went to them . When reporters asked the  | late Secretary Knox , Senator Bridges ; Major General Levin Campbell of the Army Ordnance Procurement Office , and other luminaries why they went to Monroe 's parties , they replied naively that they had gone because they wanted to see some of the interesting people Monroe had assured them would be on hand . Famous people , it seems , will always go anywhere to see other famous people . More sophisticated Washingtonians now detect in Monroe 's assurances a trace of the old social custom of the cross-talk invitation . The cross-talk invitation is the one in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dinner , and casually adds , " I 've asked Secretary Soand-So ; I know you 'll enjoy seeing him . " The senator accepts , assuming that the secretary has also accepted , and the host then calls up the secretary and invites him , holding out the senator as bait . As a result , everybody comes . Monroe has n't been seen around Washington for some time now . Some people think that what finished him as a host was not so much the committee investigation as the fact , which the investigation brought out , that his name was really Monroe Kaplan . " Personally , I have absolutely no anti-Semitic feelings , " one Washingtonian stated recently , " but you know how people are . " The fame of William S. Jack in Washington is perhaps less than Mr. Monroe 's , but his headache is bigger . Mr. Jack is the man who was asked , last January , to give back a lot of money to the government on the renegotiation of his contract for producing airplane parts . Jack , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in February , 1944 , and set about wooing the powers on Capitol Hill . There was a beautiful simplicity in his approach . He just rented the main ballroom of the Mayflower Hotel and invited the Senate and House of Representatives to dinner . Half a dozen senators and over sixty representatives came to the party , as well as some two hundred other guests . They ate a chicken dinner and watched a movie showing working conditions and production at the Jahco plant , as it is nicknamed . After the movie , when the guests were well fed and , presumably , entertained , Bill Jack rose , took off his coat , and earnestly addressed the throng in his shirtsleeves . He spoke of his humble beginning as a newsboy , dwelt on free enterprise in America , and , rolling up his shirtsleeves , presented the perfect picture of a righteous , self-made man . " Corny ? Sure , " one guest said later . " But it was good corn . " The results of the Jahco party are not yet fully known , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nelson gave a party the same night ? a WPB exhibit of the war-production contributions of some four thousand labor management committees . There were no refreshments . Only a fleeting senator or two and six representatives showed up . j LL this goes to show that when you set . t out to woo Washington you can do it on your knees or standing on your head . Anything goes , if the performance is good . A lot of people have taken to calling Washington a madhouse these days . Shakespearean scholars , many of whom have gone to Washington to help the war effort , might retort with Hamlet , " Though this be madness , yet there is method i n't . " A cosier comment , however , was made recently by Clarence Bussey Hewes , a fashionable Washington bachelor and onetime diplomat who crisply rejects the notion of madness as applied to his home town . " Of course Washington is always ghastly gay in wartime , " Mr. Hewes said , in reply to a stranger 's questions , " but this war is simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which I naturally do n't remember , but we all know that Washington was so pack jammed with Southerners and sympathy was so completely all with the Confederacy that people simply cheered and gave parties every time there was a Confederate victory . And there was all the excitement about Mrs. Lincoln having two brothers fighting for the South , and her being suspected as a Confederate spy , and all that . Then the last war , the First World War , was so exciting with all those thrilling legations being sent over here with their sky-blue uniforms and all their medals . But this war " ? Mr. Hewes paused sadly ? " this war is just dull . It 's just a grim  | business . If you know what I mean , it 's not at all a popular war .

I mean to say , here you are , a tiny little bit of a place responsible for millions of people and millions of miles , but sticking firmly to your own way of doing things and being ever so calm and stubborn about it . " The elderly bachelor beamed at her . " Yes , " he said . " We flatter ourselves that we are a little bit like England . "  |
