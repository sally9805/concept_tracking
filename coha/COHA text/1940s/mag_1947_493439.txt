*MASER 22 , 1947 if we did not send aid to Europe , the price would not be going up . ' Thus , you will begin a hopeless political battle . . . on the eve of an election which will be based not on facts but on misinformation . Prices are high because we scrapped price controls . " Representative Vito Marcantonio ( ALP , N. Y. ) was howled down on an attempt to substitute a UN-administered program of $1.5 billion aid . Chester Merrow ( R , N. H. ) sought to increase the authorization to $661 million with little better results . Toward the end , the Republicans dared a semi-official attack on the program they were supposedly sponsoring . Representative Lawrence Smith ( R , Wis. ) , egged on by majority-leader Halleck , offered a proposal to cut the amount to $500 million . There is no record on who did and who did not follow Smith and Halleck through the teller gate on this one -- or on any of the other 46 proposed amendments ? or even on the final vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose counting be without benefit of official record . But no roll-call vote is needed to tell what trouble is already brewing for ERP . SIG JOHN 'S NEXT MOVE SAIL John L. Lewis once more pulled his United Mine Workers , 600,000 strong , into splendid isolation , with the curt , blue-crayoned note : " Green , AFL . We disaffiliate . Lewis . " From now on John L. will be fighting alone . There will be no " new alliance " with the CIO Left , which is too weak to pull any big unions out of the Murray line-up . Perhaps Bill Hutcheson and his AFL carpenters may follow the miners some day , but the chances are very faint . The simplest explanation of why Big John has decided to become a " loner " for keeps is that he lost his grandiloquent claim to " moral leadership " of the AFL when its October convention rejected his advice on non-Communist affidavits ( Lewis said not to sign ) . So the miners ' boss picked up the marbles and walked out . Target Practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " labeled Red during the Thomas House Un-American Activities Committee film probe because it depicted a banker as a " stuffed shirt , " absorbed another stiff punch last week , this time from an easterly direction . A Moscow radio commentator blasted the movie as anti-Soviet , declaring that the heroes of the film " yearn for a new war . " Although there is some speculation that Lewis might try to build his catch-all District 50 into competition against the AFL and CIO , it is not likely he will make the effort . He is 67 years old and in poor health . FAILURE WITH CREDIT ? Checkup . When President Truman 's Committee on Civil Rights issued its report on discrimination , a group of Montclair , New Jersey , citizens did more than read a few paragraphs and then forget . Using the report as a yardstick of community health , they proceeded to put their town through a stiff physical examination to see how it measured up . Montclair ( population 40,000 ) did n't pass . Six research committees , sponsored by the Montclair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically the same conclusion : that the town 's 6,800 Negroes live as semi-citizens in a community which discriminates against them in housing , education , employment , recreation , public health and access to public facilities . Not all of the news was bad . Some 800 Montclair townsfolk , seated in a public-school auditorium , heard the investigators report that , despite its discriminatory customs , there is solid evidence that Montclair is making progress in the treatment of its Negro population . The results of the checkup : C. Education ? The bad : On Montclair 's staff of 256 teachers , only one Negro holds a full-time position . The good : There is no segregation in the junior and senior high schools . 7 Q. Housing ? The bad : Of 170 realty deeds examined , 40 contained restrictive covenants barring Negroes , Jews and Italians . The good : The new veterans ' housing project accepts tenants solely on the basis of " need . " C. Employment ? The bad : Private concerns as a rule employ Negroes only as laborers . The good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not discriminate ; nor do the town 's Department of Public Works and Bureaus of Public Health and Nursing . C. Recreation ? The bad : The YMCA is segregated . The good : Public Recreation Department activities are open to and used by persons of all races and creeds . C. Public Health ? The bad : Negro doctors are not allowed to practise in the hospitals . The good : The hospitals employ Negro nurses . ? Public Facilities ? The bad : Four eating establishments out of eight served a mixed Negro and white investigating group with " evidences of displeasure . " One restaurant refused service entirely . The good : Three places served the group with courtesy . In general , the report made unhappy reading . But on one important score Montclair emerged with credit . It had courageously exposed its own faults in an honest effort to correct them . THE FAT FIFTT " Yellow victims .
