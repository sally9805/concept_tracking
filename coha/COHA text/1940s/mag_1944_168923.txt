STILL TIME To DIE - Jack Belden-Harper ( $3 ) . <P> ONE MAN 'S WAR-Sergeant Charles E. ( " Commando " ) Kelly-Knopf ( $2 ) . <P> Since TIME and LIFE Correspondent Jack Belden ( Retreat with Stilwell ) saw his first battle outside Peiping in 1937 , he has reported war in Burma , India , North Africa , Malta , Sicily , Italy , been wounded at Salerno , recovered to get in the thick of the current European invasion . Still Time to Die is mostly expert , on-the-spot description of the battles he has seen . But it rises a notch above other able war reporting through Correspondent Belden 's provocative summing up of what he has learned in his seven war-filled years . Some of the prime lessons : <P> " Falseness is a product of any battle . . . . No one ever knows what happened . " Before the firing stops , the " lying legend " starts on its way to the public . On the Sicilian beachhead it looked at one time as though the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole invasion fail . When Belden went to G-2 for information , " an exceptionally intelligent lieutenant colonel " simply handed him " the bare telephone conversations and orders of that day . " Said he : " This is the only thing that contains any truth . . . . We are making out a report now , but it is already so different from what happened that in a few days it will be unrecognizable legend . " <P> Readiness to spread and act upon rumor and exaggeration is a fault to which Chinese and U.S. soldiers are especially prone . The Chinese like to indulge " the vicious habit " of self-dramatization , and flattery of their superiors . But , " of the many exaggerated stories I have heard in seven years . . . none can surpass those told by American pilots and infantrymen . " <P> Uncertainty is the quality that most distinguishes a battle from any other kind of activity . It is also the most harrowing agony a soldier can endure . Belden believes that the U.S. soldier is the best trained he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken the proper trouble to introduce him to the uncertainty of war . . . . Men study maps and practice jumping off landing boats ; but when . . . a Salerno comes along , they fly out of their boats into the uncertain darkness ahead and refuse to jump , or jump ashore and then jump back . . . and have to be exhorted by chaplains to advance into the unknown . . . . " <P> " Physical courage exercises almost no influence on the outcome of a war " - because it " generally exists in such equal quantities on both sides . " But the higher courage that springs from deep beliefs is invaluable . Belden believes that the U.S. soldier is " brave , daring and resourceful , " but fatalistic . " Our men do not believe they are fighting for anything . Not one in a hundred has any deep-seated political belief . " <P> Spirit v. Ghost . Still Time to Die is often frankly bitter , often overemotional , occasionally theatrical ( in phrases such as " Battles are merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible whore 's body of war " ) . But it carries the conviction of a man whose spirit has been tried by seven years ' intimacy with war 's " dumb , bestial suffering , weariness , and utter and devastating exhaustion .
