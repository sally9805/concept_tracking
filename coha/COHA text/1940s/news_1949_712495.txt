txt LONDON , Nov. ** So-. cialist Cabinet met today and decided , according to well-authenticated reports , to make haste slowly in nationalizing the steel industry . The majority of the Cabinet , it was said , favored a compromise with the House of Lords that would get the legislation on the statute books soon to clear the way for an early general election but would postpone the actual taking over of the plants until after the popular referendum . Official announcement of the Government 's decision will be made Wednesday . The results of the Cabinet meeting 's discussion of the bill to nationalize one of the nation 's basic industries , however , will be communicated to party followers in the House of Commons tomorrow . It seems almost certain that operation of the bill to nationalize steel will be put off until after- the general election , which is expected to take place toward the end of February or at the beginning of March . Constitutionally ; the Cabinet decision takes the form of a decision to accept amendments by the House of Lords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general election . Sy accepting the broad intention of these amendments , . the Government can get the steel nationalization law on the statute books almost at once , although the actual taking over " of the properties will have to be delayed until the electorate has spoken . On the other hand , by getting the legislation enacted now , the Government can go to the people , holding that it has carried out all its election pledges as far as it has been able , and then ask for a vote of ratification . If the expected compromise is proposed and is accepted by the // BRITISH LABORITES SEEK STEEL DELAY // House of Lords , the bill can be enacted without further delay . But , instead of taking over the steel industry during this session of Parliament , as the original bill proposed , the vesting day will be postponed . If the Conservatives win , they will , of course , repeal the act and the steel industry will continue as a private enterprise . If , however , the present Government is returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Cabinet met while Parliament was going through the final phases of passing an act to limit the power of the Lords to delay legislation for more than a year ? a law designed to clear the way to legalize steel nationalization within the life of this Government . With steel nationalization authorized by this Parliament , it would be possible for the Labor Government to go to the country for a new mandate any time after the middle of February with the slogan that it had delivered the goods . New Austerity Foreseen The next budget is due early in April and will almost certainly contain some bitter new doses of austerity . The Government probably will prefer to make its appeal to the voters before rather than after it is presented . In the Government 's effort to keep prices from rising to the I point where they can offset the advantages of devaluation in the export trade and to prevent domestic prices from rising disastrously before the general election , the attitude of the trade unions may be decisive . Today , after a two-hour talk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union Congress appealed to all unions to postpone claims for higher wages until the general council of the organization has , declared its policy . About 4,000,000 workers who are asking wage rises are affected by this appeal . It is expected that it will tend to discourage members of other unions from making new claims .
