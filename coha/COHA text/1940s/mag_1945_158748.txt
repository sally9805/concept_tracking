( See Cover ) <P> Willie was born , full-grown , during the Italian campaign . <P> He needed a shave and his clothes hung in weary folds on his weary frame . Even on his day of creation , his thick fingers were curved , as though from grasping a pick handle or an M-1 rifle . He did not smile then and he has never smiled since . <P> Willie was born into the 45th Infantry Division , where his creator , Private Bill Mauldin , also served . Willie had a sidekick , Joe . Together Willie and Joe slogged from Italy to Germany . <P> Willie and Joe were citizen soldiers . Before their incarnation , they had presumably been peaceful citizens . Now they were veterans of war 's hardships , its filth , discomforts and agonizing boredom . War was bad weather and soaking clothes , cold rations and no letters from home . War was mile after mile of tramping , getting just as tired advancing as retreating , sleeping in barns , bathing in icy rivers , scrounging for small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in stills made from wrecked airplane parts ; reading with vacant eyes the labels on K-ration tins or even German propaganda leaflets , just to be reading . <P> War was praying between artillery barrages ; pitying the starved Italian children and the Italian women standing in the midst of their ruined homes . War was watching their friends die , one after the other , day after day after day . War was learning the ecstasy of wiggling a little finger just to see it move and know that you were still alive . War was hell . <P> Willie and Joe were combat infantrymen . <P> In any army 's vast organization , combat infantrymen are the hundreds of thousands ( among the many millions ) who are always in the front lines and who carry the dirtiest , heaviest burden of any war . They are the heroes whom the Army this week honors on Infantry Day ( June 15 ) - the anniversary of the day that George Washington was named commander in chief of the Continental Army .

Willie and Joe , speaking their sardonic mouthfuls , usually say what youthful Bill Mauldin himself has to say on the subject of war . But in a book ( Up Front , published this week ) written around them , Mauldin has added further remarks , for the benefit of those civilians who find Willie and Joe a little bewildering . He explains : " I have n't tried to picture this war in a big , broad-minded way . I 'm not old enough to understand what it 's all about . " <P> His book is a text ( some 30,000 words ) to some 160 of his pictures . It throws sharp light on cartoons which are serious and gay , ribald and sentimental , tough , touching and bitter-the best cartoons to come out of the war . <P> Up Front , which is like a long letter home , sets forth some of Bill Mauldin 's favorite gripes , which are the gripes of all infantrymen .
