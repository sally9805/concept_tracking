txt For a Boy Scout Destroyer In your editorial columns of Jan. 2 you pay tribute to the Boy Scouts of America and their chief , Dr. James E. West . I am wondering if each of the 1,400 , .. 000 Boy Scouts could raise $5 during the course of a year . It would be a difficult yet not an impossible job , I believe . With the money so raised the Boy Scouts could giv-e our Navy a new destroyer , which would cost six to seven million dollars . Tlfa ship could be named after Dr. West and would represent for many year/ a symbol of the American boys ' love for their country and desire to see it d ' fended against all invaders . It might also help to get many young boys interested in a career in the Navy . BURROWS SLOAN . Princeton , N. J. , Jan. 4 , 1941.
