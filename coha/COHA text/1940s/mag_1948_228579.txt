The sky over Mexico City , blue and cloudless since November , last week turned grey . Now &; then a little rain fell , and the afternoon winds ceased to cloak the city with powdery dust from the fields outside . In many a village women got ready for the first family wash since the village brook dried up last fall . Men stuck out their tongues to taste the rain , ' or stood watching it soak into the parched earth . <P> In regions where the rains had not yet started , Indians slipped into church to pray before the images of their favorite saints , and in the plazas they danced to the ancient Tlaloc , Aztec god of rain . They prayed that the rains might be plentiful , that the brown land might grow green and that this might be the one year in five when crops would be so good that Mexico could feed itself . <P> In the shiny , modernistic office building in Mexico City 's Avenida Morelos , the men of the Department of Soil Conservation studied their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were small that the Mexican land would feed its people well .

Now they count themselves lucky if they plant in six . Corn , grown year after year on the same plots , has sapped the goodness from the soil . In the current Harper 's Magazine , William Vogt , chief of the conservation section of the Pan American Union , warns that " unless there is a profound modification in its treatment of the land , the greater part of Mexico will be a desert within 100 years . " ( The peril , warned Vogt , hangs over all Latin America . ) <P> Mexicans are trying to do something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has spent $200 million on irrigation which has brought water to two million parched acres . President Miguel Alemn hopes to do as much in his six years of office as were done in the previous 21 . But last week many a Mexican put his hope in God instead of man .
