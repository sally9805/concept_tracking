Last week the stars , the sun , the moon behaved according to law . On Earth 's surface , which , from a few miles up , might have seemed uninhabited , mankind 's performances continued to unroll . Here &; there , as usual , bits of the action and dialogue were recorded by journalists who were , as usual , uneasily aware that their jottings were inadequate . <P> But among thousands of apparently unrelated bits of " news " last week were two items as closely related as the horns of a dilemma . One was that the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission is going to establish a testing ground for atomic weapons somewhere in the Pacific . The other was a sentence spoken by a Republican presidential candidate , Harold Stassen : " The greatest basic competition of all history Russia v. the U.S. can not really be decided by war . " <P> Everyone who heard these two items knew that they added up to a dilemma . Some day , as Stassen said , the dilemma would have to be resolved " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace of God . " But at that point it began to sound like wishful thinking , and what could wishful thinking do against Communist fanaticism ? <P> Americans were still sure that it is better to win a war than lose it . They were sure that , if it came to war again , they would win again . But Americans , like all the rest of mankind , had also begun to suspect that if war 's weapons grew much more powerful , victory and defeat might be equated . What would the victor do in a blasted or half-blasted world ? <P> For hundreds of thousands in Europe and Asia , defeat and victory were already indistinguishable . Perhaps only those who had survived defeat knew what victory really looked like . They might not be able to describe it exactly , but they could draw pictures of it ( see cut ) . And the pictures were like palindromes. * <P> Stassen 's words , which everyone accepted , and the AEC 's plan to develop bigger &; better weapons , which everybody accepted too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , from every direction . The dilemma could only be solved by a paradox , by a miracle , by finding the moral equivalent of the atomic bomb . <P> <P> *A sentence that reads the same , forward or backward . Famed example : " Able was I ere I saw Elba " ( apocryphally attributed to Napoleon ) .
