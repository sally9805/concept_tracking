New York early in 1946 , he said , he learned of his " election " to the party 's national committee from Eugene Dennis , now the party 's general secretary and one of the defendants . The witness was then asked what party position Mr. Dennis then held . This was an important question legally because it required // BALKY RED EDITOR HELD IN CONTEMPT // a top party leader to confirm testimony by Government witnesses on the responsibility of other top leaders for party teachings . Mr. Gates refused to answer , saying : " I 'm not going to become a stool pigeon and finger my fellow comrades . " Judge Medina ordered this stricken from the record and directed the witness to answer the question . Harry Sacher. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party offices were matters of " public knowledge " and the question should not be pressed .

" Judge Medina overruled this constitutional argument and pointed out that the witness had not pleaded constitutional privilege in refusing to answer . He then asked the defense lawyers what they thought he should do to a witness " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer a question I deem relevant and proper . " The judge said it was " perfectly normal " procedure to ask a witness such questions , and this witness was acting in a " contumacious " manner . If the defense won its point , he added , the court would be in the position of letting the defendants decide what questions to answer and what questions not to answer . On Mr. Sacher 's request for time to consult his client , the judge asked the witness whether he still refused to answer . Dennis Tries to Intervene The witness remained silent , but Mr. Dennis rose to speak . The judge asked him to sit down and pressed the witness for an answer .

" " If the witness continues to refuse to answer responsively , " the judge said , " I 'm going to give him until tomorrow morning to think it over . " Mr. Sacher then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the defendants were prepared to stipulate all party positions they had held . The judge asked Mr. whether he would accept the stipulation , and the prosecutor said he would not . " Since the defendant offered himself as a witness , " Mr. declared , " I have a right , to ask him relevant ant= material ' questions . " Judge Medina upheld the prosecutor and said the administration of justice could not function if defendants in a conspiracy case could refuse to answer such questions . " The defendant was not required to offer himself as a witness , " the judge pointed out . " When he chose to take the stand , he subjected himself to questioning just like any other witness . " Mr. Sacher then said that in view of the offer of the stipulation by the other defendants he now advised his client to answer the question . The jury was recalled . and the witness then replied that in January , 1946 , Mr. Dennis was a member of the party 's national board , its national committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness to identify other party officials who are not among the defendants . Judge Medina reserved decision on defense objections to this question , and directed counsel to file briefs this morning . He adjourned court early , pending settlement of this issue .

In case the United States declared war , he said , he would not volunteer and would not have his heart in it if drafted by this country , but would try to persuade the American people to end the war .
