It began as a routine rescue operation . Within 24 hours after an Air Force C-47 disappeared over Greenland 's bleak south coast , search planes spotted the crash , 100 miles north of the Air Force base at Bluie West One. * Supplies were parachuted down and a B-17 was ordered in from Goose Bay , Labrador to pick up the seven uninjured crewmen . But from then on Greenland 's treacherous flying weather began sucking in rescue aircraft and men like a snow-whipped whirlpool . <P> In terse , cautious messages , the Air Force pumped out the bare details of one failure after another . Battling 100-m.p.h. winds and 40-below-zero temperatures , the rescuers could not even get started for three days . When they did , the B-17 swerved out of control as it swooped down on to the rutted icecap , nosed over into a snowbank and marooned its two crewmen with the others . <P> Four days later a C-54 tried again , this time releasing a glider and two-man crew for an air-ground pickup . Twice the tow plane managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glider broke through the icy crust and bogged down in the snow ; the pickup line snapped . The glider 's crew joined the nine stranded men on the icecap . More food and clothing were dropped , along with heaters , fuel and a collapsible plywood shelter . The shivering airmen burrowed into the snow , rigged a canvas roof overhead as protection against the gale . The days dragged on . <P> On the third rescue attempt the glider was safely loaded and picked up . It lifted 50 feet into the air before the towline snapped . A week later it , happened again with a new glider . Two more airmen were left stranded . By Christmas Day , the C-47 survivors had been down for 16 days , and the original seven-man group had swollen to 13 . <P> This week , with no rescue yet in sight , the Navy joined the operation , sent the carrier Saipan north from Norfolk with three Piasecki ( " Sagging Sausage " ) helicopters , each capable of carrying eight passengers . The red-faced Air Force ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernt Balchen , who had commanded the Air Force 's first successful glider rescue in Alaska fortnight ago . <P> <P> * Along with Bluie West Eight , a wartime code name for the Air Force 's Greenland bases . In the same area , during the war , six P-38s and two B-17s were forced down in one day .
