Finnish-Russian peace negotiations were still in the never-never stage of rumor and ' hind-scenes talk . One fact was known : the Finnish Government still refused to accept Russian terms which-to everybody but the Finns-had seemed surprisingly mild . <P> A supposition abroad had been that the Finnish people , yearning for peace , were kept in the war solely by Nazi pressure and the duplicity of their Russophobic Government . Last week TIME Correspondent John Scott , visiting Helsinki , found evidence that this idea was wishful nonsense . Finland 's Nazi allies had indeed brought pressure ; the Helsinki Government had indeed been stubborn . But the war also had popular backing ; Finns in general simply did not believe that they had been beaten , hence saw no reason to hurry into peace on Russian terms . Cabled Scott : <P> " Helsinki is a better-fed , better-dressed , more normal-looking wartime capital than I expected to find it . Bomb damage from three major Russian raids in February is not nearly so noticeable as in Liverpool , for example . Many houses have unbroken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three more completely burned out . ( one of which is the Soviet Legation building ) . <P> " Everyone in Helsinki tells me that the Finnish food situation is now substantially better than it was twelve months ago . In general , the Helsinki food situation is comparable with that in London . In a half-dozen restaurants excellent meals are obtainable at ' economic ' ( i.e. , high ) prices . But , as in Britain 's capital , hundreds of working-class restaurants are giving the man on the street enough to eat at reasonable prices . . . . <P> " Clothes are difficult to obtain in Helsinki but most people on the street are as well-dressed as the London wartime average . One sees many soldiers on the streets , mostly Finnish , some German , well-dressed and seemingly of good morale . <P> " As far as most ordinary Finns can see both on the front and in the rear , Finland is an undefeated country in which wartime life is difficult but by no means intolerable . . . . <P> " The impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is-in any case the Government should not close the doors for further negotiations with the Russians , but should try to get better terms than those which are now being discussed . Most Finns want peace under conditions which would assure Finland liberty and independence , but many doubt whether the present Russian proposals guarantee these to Finland . "
