Under the whiplash of World War II 's direst crisis , the U.S. Army had poured troops , arms and supplies into the British Isles for a second-front fighting force . Yet the machine was a long way from being tuned up , would not run at full power before spring . One measure of its progress : the last cogs in its high command were supplied only last week . <P> Top Commander of the A.E.F. is Lieut . General Dwight David Eisenhower , 51 , whose promotion to the top ranks was one of the cheering signs that the War Secretary Stimson and Chief of Staff Marshall had abandoned promotion by seniority , had long been digging deep down in the Army files for the best men it had . <P> How many U.S. soldiers were under General Eisenhower 's command was a military secret . But it could be said that they were already in the hundreds of thousands . The work of organization , of training , feeding , maintenance of equipment and all the other details of behind-the-lines preparation was enough to crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top military precisionist . <P> The A.E.F. now in Britain could bear little resemblance in organization and distribution of fighting units to the A.E.F. that will jump off when the second front is launched . The big emphasis now had to be on troops that pave the way for a drive : Quartermaster , Engineer and Signal Corps outfits , housekeeping units for the Air Forces . Some combat units were on hand . But the bulk of the A.E.F. 's striking power would come later . <P> As he laid his elaborate groundwork , West Pointer Eisenhower could be well pleased that his top commanders were , like himself , relatively young generals and products of the merit system . <P> Air Forces Commander in Britain ( and therefore the General whose troops will first see action ) is Major General Carl ( " Tooey " ) Spaatz , 51 , a hardbitten , freckled veteran who has been flying Army aircraft since the year after he left West Point ( 1914 ) . <P> " Tooey " Spaatz knew that he would do little flying beyond chases from field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being , his job too was heavily weighted with housekeeping affairs . New airdromes must be built to make room for the U.S. Air Forces . General Spaatz 's command had to be accented strongly on the side of ground-bound outfits : Engineers , Air Forces supply men , Air Base groups . These outfits will operate airdromes , build overhaul depots to put planes back in running order when major crackups or plain wear &; tear put them out of the fight . <P> For training his combat crews and starting tactical cooperation with the R.A.F. , General Spaatz could leave details to his bomber commander , husky , seasoned , 46-year-old Major General Ira Eaker and to his fighter commander , whose name has not yet been announced . Real U.S. participation in big-scale bombing would have to wait until their organization work was completed and plenty of equipment was on hand .
