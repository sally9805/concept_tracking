txt The way was finally opened today for a great new anti-inflation tax program . At a conference of representatives of the House , Senate , Treasury , and Fred Vinson , new Economic Stabilization Director , prompt congressional action on a new tax bill to take effect Jan. 1 , 1944 , was agreed upon . This appears to open the way for the long-awaited second tax front . President Roosevelt indicated such action was imminent last Tuesday at a press conference when he said he expected shortly to implement his request of Jan. 5 , 1943 , for " 16 billions of additional funds . " Today 's action comes a little over six months after Mr .. Roosevelt 's original request to Congress . Effective in January Present at the conference today were chairman Doughton of the , House Ways and Means Commit- ' tee . plus Representatives Cooper and Disney of the same body ; Chairman George of the Senate Finance Committee and Senator ' Byrd of the same group ; Secretary / of the Treasury Morgenthau , Un-1 dersecretary Bell , Treasury Coun-t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the Tax Subcommittee in the House . " No decision ' was made as to the amount of taxes or the method of taxation , " Mr. Doughton explained as he left the meeting . He declared that " every reasonable effort will be made to pass a new tax bill this year , the main provisions of which will become effective Jan. 1 , 1944 . " Action on new taxes , urged by President Roosevelt , was delayed five months by controversy over the Ruml Plan . By partially doubling taxes , the bill enacting the Rum ! Plan , which also initiates a 20 per cent withholding tax beginning July 1 , will raise $3 billions of additional taxes . Subtracting this from Mr. Roosevelt 's original request , theoretically only S13 billions of new taxes or savings are now required . Inflationary Gap Treasure officials point out , however , that by delaying the tax bill approximately a year , from January , 1943 , wnen dir . Roosevelt made his budget recommendation to Jain . 1 , 1944 , when Chairman Doughton now hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been lost . Mr. Roosevelt : SIG billion proposal was designed to raise 50 per cent of the cost of the war out of current taxes , instead of about 34 per cent , the present rate . Canada , Australia , and Britain are all now raising more than 50 per cent of the cost of war from taxes . It was also designed to cut down the so-called " inflationary gap , " which is the difference oetween what war-inflated wages and salaries are available , and the consumers ' goods which can be purchased . At his press conference last week Mr. Roosevelt said that everybody knew the inflationary gap was increasing and that there would be no real economic change for the better until that gap was closed . Mr. Roosevelt 's press conference statement last week was followed by announcement of a forthcoming tax gathering which took place today . OES Director Vinson , familiar with tax matters , is believed to have finally brought all elements of Congress , and Treasury officials , together . Behind the scenes a controversy has been going on between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue recom mendations to Congress Which have been promptly torn into shreds , and discarded . The Treasury accordingly this year held back in making recommendations . The con'gressional tax leaders , on the other hand , argued that they should not take the lead until revenue proposals had come from the Treasury . Sates Taxes Possible The real issue is how severe the new consumption taxes shall be . In politics this means " sales taxes " though there are other types favored by the Treasury . The Administration has opposed sales taxes in theory , as bearing more heavily on the poor than the rich . Mr. Roosevelt repeated this general objection last week . However , back m January he discussed the matter in his budget . While , he said , sales taxes had no " permanent " place in the federal tax structure . he added : " However , we may later be compelled to reconsider the teimporary necessity of such measures . " It is assumed this still represents Administration viewpoint , The House . from which revenue legislation must originate , has scheduled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Doughtor indicated that work on the new tax bill will start late in July . Today 's meeting seems chiefly to have been a victory for Mr. Vinson. supported , it is understood by Messrs . Byrnes and Baruch.
