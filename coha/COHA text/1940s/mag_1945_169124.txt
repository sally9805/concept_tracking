A warm Chinook wind softened the snow of Central Alberta . Squaws silently folded the tents and tepees . Soon the little band of Ochase Indians would be moving down across the prairie from Whitecourt to the foothills of the Rockies on their last migration-to a Government reservation . <P> At long last they were conceding that the white man had come to North America to stay . Now that the Ochase and the companion Sunchild tribe , 300 souls in all , were abandoning their nomadic life , there would be no migratory Indians left in Canada south of the subArctic . <P> Old Chief John Ochase had parleyed time after time with Government men anxious to settle the tribe on a reservation . Always he began : " I want to speak with a straight tongue , not a crooked tongue , " ended by firmly refusing . <P> Last spring one of the tribesmen quarreled with his wife , shot her with his rifle . The squaw , Ocha Ka Kay Nee Noo ( " young woman who walks with distinction " ) , died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After that , John Ochase lacked the spirit to stand against the white man . When the bands voted to accept a treaty , he signed it with his mark . <P> For the Ochase-Sunchild reservation the Government has set aside 47,000 acres 100 miles southwest of Edmonton . There , as wards of the Crown , the Indians will have free schools , free medical care , supplies for the needy . The treaty provides that they may live on their land " as long as the sun shines , the river flows , and the grass grows green . "
