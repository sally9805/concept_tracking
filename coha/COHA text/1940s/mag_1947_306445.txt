DEER CREEK ( 310 pp. ) - Gulielma Fell Alsop-Vanguard ( $3 ) . <P> Gulielma Alsop* can remember when a nickel was a respectable weekly allowance for a little girl . When she went walking with her father , a Quaker who became an Episcopal minister , they were quite apt , as she now recalls it , to discuss such recondite matters as literary style and changing concepts of right &; wrong . There were no Sunday papers " in that happy time which has since been called the Gay Nineties , " but in the Alsop house in Brooklyn Heights there was a set period of meditation and contemplation called Searching Out the Heart . There was also a great deal of fun , but very little nonsense , in the Victorian childhood which Author Gulielma Alsop recalls with understandable nostalgia in Deer Creek . <P> For most readers , home was never like this . Before the Alsop children were permitted to dress , they were required to chin themselves three times . French , German and Latin were taught at home and they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piano , drawing , dancing and sewing were required and so was excellence at swimming , riding and tennis . Father did n't ask the impossible , but he expected all of his children to be in the first ten in their classes at Packer Collegiate Institute . When Gulielma was too ill to do homework , she was told to maintain her standing by memorizing what went on in class . Father did not permit his womenfolk to wear corsets , because he held that the body , as well as the mind , should remain uncramped . <P> For Grace . She learned to enter a room gracefully by rehearsing it hundreds of times under her grandmother 's watchful eyes , mastered the curtsy by practicing endlessly with a heavy encyclopedia balanced on her head . But these and other accomplishments were merely part of the endless process of character building . " The Lord 's part of salvation could be left to the Lord to attend to , but our share had to be worked at diligently . " <P> Deer Creek is by no means this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes with great charm of city life in Brooklyn and country life in Pennsylvania , of the place that the church and religion had in the life of half a century ago . Readers will find a rounded picture of a full and satisfying kind of U.S. family life that is rapidly dying out . <P> For Family Eyes . To link their children with a passing generation , Gulielma 's parents both wrote novels about their youth for family reading only . Their daughters have chosen to write for a larger public ; Gulielma 's sister , who writes under her pen name , Mary O'Hara , is the author of the best-selling My Friend Flicka and Thunderhead . Gulielma , whose third book is Deer Creek , studied medicine , spent four years in China as a medical missionary , has been staff physician at Manhattan 's Barnard College for more than a quarter of a century . <P> To make Gulielma and Mary aware that the present was never static , their young minds were constantly fed new thought . Gulielma Alsop sharply remembers the evening my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' What would you think if you had been descended from a monkey ? ' . . . <P> " ' A monkey , Papa ? But I could n't be . ' <P> " ' From whom are you descended , Sister ? <P> " ' God ' - that was natural and inevitable .
