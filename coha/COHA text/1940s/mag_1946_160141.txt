Philosophized Lebanon 's husky , furrow-browed Charles Habib Malik ( Ph.D. , Harvard ) : " As Aristotle said ... a horse runs - it does not converse . A house does not make love-it is for living in . " Malik 's question : What is U.N . good for ? <P> Lebanon gave its own answer when it suggested that U.N . have the world 's greatest books translated into all the world 's languages . In U.N . ' s General ( Steering ) Committee one day last week , the proposal caused a weary two-hour debate . Queried Russia ( Andrei Gromyko ) : " What is the cost of such enterprise ? ... " Replied Lebanon : " . . . Small , in proportion to the benefit . . . . " <P> Uruguay and New Zealand ( Roberto MacEachen and Sir Carl Berendsen ) tried to escape from the room , were testily waved back to their seats by the Chair ( Paul-Henri Spaak ) . The Ukraine ( Dmitri Manuilsky ) prodded sarcastically : " Who is to decide which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought has taken some very capricious turns at times ! Very capricious . ... " ( Lebanon 's own uncapricious selections : Plato , Aristotle , St. Augustine , St. Thomas Aquinas , Shakespeare , Leibnitz , Pascal , Descartes , Kant , Averroes. * ) The matter was referred to the Assembly , to be referred back to a committee . <P> Two days later , Committee One discussed admission of Eire , Albania , Portugal , Trans-Jordan and the Mongolian People 's Republic . The overheated committee room , with its entire contents of delegates , tables and sorely tried hopes , seemed to swim in a bluish haze of tobacco smoke . Cuba ( Guillermo Belt ) dozed off , woke up a quarter-hour later , rosy-cheeked and refreshed . Later , South Africa ( Jan Christian Smuts ) went to sleep . Declared Liberia ( C. Abayomi Cassell ) : " . . . We will not move the big powers-each of them has its own fish to fry . . . . " <P> Meanwhile , in a corner of the deserted Security Council chamber , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sat China 's neat , dignified Wellington Koo . He was deep in the slumber of an oldtimer who has learned to doze discreetly through such occasions . <P> Seeping out of the cafeteria , permeating the peaceful scene , was the strong , vital scent of freshly cooked sauerkraut . <P> <P> * Twelfth-Century Arab philosopher , whose own attempts to propagate classics , chiefly Aristotle , came to the West in a Latin translation of a Hebrew rendition of his Arabic commentary upon an Arabic translation of a Syriac translation of the Greek original .
