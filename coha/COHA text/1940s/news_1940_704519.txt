txt A business leader and a New Deal official crossed swords last night on the subject of government regulation of business . Ernest T. Weir , chairman of National Steel Corp . and president of the American Iron and Steel Institute , declared that " regulation " is becoming " control " and is stifling private enterprise and genuine recovery . Mr. Weir spoke at a dinner of the Economic Club of New York on a program in which Harold L. Ickes . Secretary of the interior , upheld the cause of regulation which , he said , businessmen themselves had initiated in the first place . " One set of businessmen " he said , " In the name of preserving the system of private enterprise , is always invoking against other businessmen the power of the people . I. e government . " The SEC. the National Labor Relations Board , the Guffey Act , and the Administration 's agricultural program bore the brunt of Mr. Weir 's attack . Government control exerted through these agencies has made It impossible for enterprisers and investors , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any movement that can generate and sustain momentum , to function , he said . Ca n't Use Own Judgment No longer can the enterpriser make free use of his own judgment , experience and ability , but is being forced to act guardedly if at all while increased business risks , reduced profits . and heavy taxes on remaining profits have forced investors to seek safety and guaranteed low return of corporate and government bonds rather than the substantial gains formerly possible in common stock ventures . Mr. Weir cited as examples of his thesis a company which would like to spend $25.000.000 on expansion and improvements but which can not sell common stock except at sacrifice prices which the company can not afford and a utility company which has on the drafting boards plans for a power unit that would cost $10,000,000 and provide 2,100 " men with steady jobs for 15 months . SEC Consumer 's Power Action Mr. Weir took particular issue with the Securities and Exchange Commission 's denial a few weeks ago of permission for Consumers Power Co. to issue certain 3% bonds , part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for new capital The Commission said in effect . Mr. Weir stated : " You can issue bonds to refund other bonds if you wish but if you want new money you must issue common stock . " " Now think what this means , " Mr Weir told his audience . " By express provision of the Securities and Exchange Act , the Commission does not bear any responsibility for the merits of securities it approves Furthermore , neither the Commission nor anyone else can be sure that tomorrow or next week some branch of government will not act to depreciate the value of the stock . even to the extent of making it worthless . Furthermore , under present conditions , the company would have to sell the stock at a price which would make it cost about 8% per year as against 3% for the bonds Despite all this the Commission presumes  --  against the will of the company and against its best interests ? to wrest from its hands a vital and longrecognized function of management . That 's not regulation ; that 's control " Turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfair instrument to begin with , Mr. Weir asserted that in hands of the Labor Board it has become " an ugly spectacle of unchecked power run wild . " Reverting to his theme that " regulation ' has become - control , " Mr. Weir cited efforts of the Bituminous Coal Commission to fix coal prices in the industry as evidence that govern merit is usurping vital functions of management . Agriculture Program The Administration 's agricultural program he continued , has dislocated practically the entire farming structure with the result that go%eminent holds the power and the public , including many farmers , holds the bag Other examples of " control " cited by Mr Weir included the RFC which he said has sought to control the banks and business firms in need of borrowing money and the RobinsonPatman Act which he said is an attempt to control business practices of industry Government Agencies Secretary Ickes. taking up the " government interference with business " charge , declared that government regulatory agencies were created at the insistence of businessmen themselves Furthermore their complaints ? ' keep those agencies constantly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ICC in the first place at the insistence of grain producers and grain merchants and local supply houses in the farming west he sam The bus and true king industry was brought unuer the ICC by railroads " that felt the trucking competition " The aviation industry put itself under the CAA " to ward off the attempt of businessmen and the railroads to get aviation under the control of what they hoped was a railroad-minded ICC . ' And in addition to labor , behind the wage and hour laws are " manufacturers in high-priced labor areas like New England and New York who rightly think it is n't cricket to have to compete for a national market , which includes New England and New York . against competitors in low-priced child labor areas . " He continued : " Who presses the TNEC for hearings on the oil industry and the tobacco industry and urges government officials to ask embarrassing questions of businessmen " Other businessmen in those same industries Who presses the inquiries at the SEC as to the reason why middiewestern investors ca n't buy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bidding without paying an unnecessary regional tribute to you people in New York ' Businessmen  --  investment bankers in Chicago and Cleveland who say they do n't understand why there has to be a basing point for United States finance at 23 Wall Street . any more than a lot of ether middlewesterners ever understood wh7 . Chicago steel bad to be priced in Chicago on the Pittsburgh basing point . - When it " Rosiness Man Is Mad " Mr Ica % ... declared that when a " businessman is mad because government is ' interfering with his business , v. hat he s really sputtering about is another businessman  --  because government , acting as a referee between the two of them , has decided that the second businessman Is right in his idea of what promotes the American system of free private enterprise . " Mr. Ickes declared that while businessmen a - confidence is helpful at all times , it " is n't w hat is really indispensable at a time like this "  --  the confidence that is utterly indispensable is that of the great mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this confluence of the mass was lodged in the captains of business . he said but today they have confiuence in only one symbol -- the federal government and particularly . in President Roosevelt ? Anything you do at this time to shake the confidence of the great mass of the American people in either the President or the national government is a sin against free enterprise , individual liberty , political democracy and your own self interest " the Secretary said .
