txt FATHER-SON ' DRAFT BEGINS IN SUBURBS ; CITY STARTS TODAY Veterans of World War I and Youngsters Born After It Are in the Registration Lines 600,000 EXPECTED HERE Names Will Go at Foot of the Present Lists  --  Standards on Eyes and Teeth Are Eased America 's first war-time draft registration since 1917 got under way yesterday when the vanguard of possibly 9,000,000 men from 20 to 44 appeared to sign themselves into the selective service system . In Long Island , Westchester and New Jersey , for examples , the " father and son " draft started with a heavy turnout of men with a wide range of backgrounds and professional interests . New York City men will- register today and tomorrow ; throughout the country the general registration day will be tomorrow . That the new registration is a " father and son " affair literally as well as figuratively will be symbolized at local selective service headquarters , 1 East Forty-fourth Street , this morning at 11 o'clock when a father and his boy will register simultaneously . They will be William Nemeck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of 401 East Seventy-third Street . The father , who served with the Seventh Field Signal Battalion during World War I , is now a coordinator-inspector attached to selective service headquarters . It was expected that among the estimated 600,000 new registrants in the five boroughs , to say nothing of the vaster nation - wide total , there would be many other such combinations . The suggestion that they were ready to " do the job right this time " came yesterday from many - of the early registrants , at both age extremes . From 7 A. M. to 9 P. 1W , Registration headquarters  --  those of local draft boards , in most instances  --  will be open here from 7 A. M. to 9 P. M. today and tomorrow . College students from out of town , or residents of dormitories , will register on their campuses , rather than at local boards . Meanwhile , selective service national headquarters in Washington cleared up last evening a question that the local organization had been unable to decide earlier in the day . This concerned the relationship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records either on Oct. 16 , 1940 , the date of the first and major draft , or on July 1 , 1941 , when youths who had become 21. since the first call were taken into the system . These two registrations supplied selective service with a man pool of 17,639,118 nationally and of 1,044,375 in New York City . There was inevitably considerable curiosity as to whether the new men would be added to the bottom of the lists or integrated with the others . Integration was used following the second or " S " draft . ( The first had no letter designation ; the current one will use a " T. " ) That is , each of the 750,000 registrants of last July , of whom 43,000 signed up in this city , were inserted into previous lists , at an interval , say , of ten . For a while yesterday it looked as if a similar system would be attempted this time , although local headquarters inclined to doubt it . Finally , after first announcing " integration , " selective service headquarters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new names will be added to the lists , not absorbed by them . To Exhaust 1-A Group First Augmenting the announcement , the agency said that those now registering for the first time would not be subject to call until after the original reservoir of 1-A man power had been exhausted . Thus , in general , it appeared that men in the age groups registering this week need not expect to be called for service for a matter of weeks and probably months . At the same time , although figures are now taboo , officials here cautioned that " we 're getting along pretty well toward the end of the reservoir pool , " so that in some districts prompt calls may be expected by new registrants . Another important development // LONG ISLANDERS REGISTERING FOR THE- DRAFT FATHER-SON ' DRAFT BEGINS IN SUBURBS // of the day was the announcement here , following receipt of a form letter from Brig . Gen. Lewis B. Hershey dated Friday , of impor- I tent easing of restrictions regarding men with defective eyes and teeth . Moreover , Washington indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped to complete the first inventory of the nation 's man power in history by cataloguing those in the 18-20 and 45-64 age groups . Not liable for active duty , these registrants will be eligible for civilian defense or production work . General Hershey 's letter regarding eyes and teeth was described by Colonel Samuel J. Kopetzky , local medical officer , as the " first sensible change , " and as " what the medical profession has been asking for " with regard to the registrants involved . General Hershey announced that from now on registrants " who have no disqualifying defects except a lack of required number of teeth * * * when , in the opinion of the-examining physician they are well-nourished , of good musculature , are free from gross dental infections , and have sufficient teeth ( natural or artificial ) to subsist on the Army ration , " should be accepted for " general military service in all branches . " The " required number of teeth " referred to was a minimum of six masticating and six incisor units , all real . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man can be classified as 1-A if he has n't a single tooth , providing he can nourish himself on Army food . Among previous registrants in New York City , 10.39 per cent were rejected for factors including defective teeth . Dr. Kopetzky said he would " guess " that as many as two-thirds of them might be reclassified on the basis of the new ruling . Ruling on Eyesight General Hershey ruled , on eyes , that a man might now be considered eligible for " all non-combatant branches " if his vision rating was " below 20/100 , but not below 20/200 in each eye without glasses if correctible to 20/40 in each eye , " and added that " the actual possession of suitable glasses by an individual is not required for his acceptance under these standards . " Perfect vision is recorded as 20/20 , meaning in effect that at a distance of twenty feet a man sees what the normal eye would see at that distance . A rating like 20/40 , accordingly , means that at twenty fee he can see what he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The original rule on eyes was that men rated 20/100 , if correctible to 20/40 , could be classified 1A ; while those whose vision was between that and 20/400 were classified 1R . Thus the effect of the new rule is to move up automatically from 1B to lA those who were put in the former class for having a rating of beteen 20/100 to 20/200 . They will be eligible , however , for noncombatant work only . Colonel Kopetzky thought that perhaps one-third of the 9.39 per cent of previous registrants whose defects included visual trouble might be reclassified on the basis of the new rule . Colonel Arthur V. , administrator of the city selective service , and Major William J. Walsh , executive officer , had everything in readiness yesterday for today 's registration here . Tomorrow , the exact date set in the original proclamation for the current registration , all the 6,443 boards from Maine to California and from Florida to Oregon will be open . In a few States  --  Michigan , Rhode Island and Utah , for examples  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of metropolitan New Yorkers , thousands of men registered in the suburbs yesterday . From youngsters who shaved once a week to grizzled ex-service men who now have sons of their own in the armed forces ; municipal officials , established business and professional men , tradesmen , fishermen , taxicab drivers , clergymen , college students and the youths who went to work right out of public school  --  they were all there . They all shared the same grim determination to do the job that must be done . The slim youngster and the man on the portly side who was old enough to be his father waited in the same line and exchanged lighthearted wisecracks , although the seriousness of what they were doing was lost on none of them . Differences in age or economic standing had little meaning here . Because of the age classifications required to register in this call there was a heavy preponderance of older men . In Newark registration was heavier than had been expected on the first day . City Commission-er Ralph Villani , director of parks i and public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old , married and the father of a seven-year-old daughter , he said : " I 'm ready to serve . There is no reason why I should n't do my part in the Army if Uncle Sam needs me . " In Paterson , Mayor William P. Furrey left his home , where he had been confined with the grip , to register at Public School 20 . " I wanted to register on the first day , " he explained . He is 44 . Representative Gordon Canfield , 43 , who served in the Army Signal Corps in the World War , registered at Public School 13 in Paterson . He came up from Washington for the purpose . At Montclair two sports figures were enrolled . They were George ( Mule ) Haas , coach for the Chicago White Sox baseball team and a former star centerfielder with the Philadelphia Athletics , and Michael Cestone , metropolitan amateur golf champion . Among those who registered in Jersey City were six priests from St. Peter 's Roman Catholic Church and Preparatory School , and Samuel Manzione , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania Railroad , who said , " If they take care of my wife , I 'm ready to go  --  that 's the spirit of all Italian-Americans . " Long Island Registers On Long Island , Holly Patterson , presiding supervisor of the town of Hempstead , was registered at the Washington Street School by his sister , Miss Charlotte Patterson , who is principal of the school . Mr. Patterson , who is 43 and unmarried , declared that he would be willing to serve in any capacity in the armed forces . Thomas F. Fitzgerald , who was a bodyguard for General John J. Pershing when the A. E. F. commander went to Germany to arrange for the Army of Occupation , was ambng those who registered in Riverhead yesterday . Mr. Fitzgerald served overseas as a first lieutenant in the Fifth Division . At Glen Cove , George Fowler , 43-year-old Negro , who fought in the Army with his six brothers during the World War , said he wished he was young enough to fight for his country actively again . " Then I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in now , " he declared . One of his brothers won the Croix de Guerre . A salesman who registered at Patchogue when asked to name the person who would always know his address , replied : " Well , from past experience I guess I had better give the name of the company that finances my automobile  --  they always find me . " " I was too young to serve in the last war , but I 'm not too old to serve in this one , " Mayor Stanley W. Church of New Rochelle commented as he registered in Isaac Young High School . He is 41 , married and the father of two children , but said he would claim no deferment either because of his office or his family status . District Attorney Elbert T. Gallagher of Westchester County registered in Katonah . He is 44 and a resident of Bedford Village . During the World War he served as an ensign in the Naval Reserve .                  @ @ @
