The smoldering bitterness of U.S. Negroes against segregation in the services flared into flame again last week . This time the fuel was laid by respected onetime Federal Judge William H. Hastie , dean of Howard University Law School . Explaining this week why he had resigned as Negro civilian aide to the Secretary of War , he charged the Army Air Forces was discriminating against Negroes . <P> When the 99th ( Negro ) Fighter Squadron was formed , Lawyer Hastie insisted that it should not be segregated from white outfits , either in training or operation . It was . In the conflict between the ethical right of the Negro soldier and officer to be treated like anyone else , and the practical impossibility of doing it in the face of existing prejudice , the Air Forces had chosen the practical way . <P> But Judge Hastie went further . He charged that the Air Forces had failed to train enough civilian technicians , had given enlisted men of the 99th jobs of common labor . Furthermore , said he , these and other acts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for comment or approval , as had been specified when he was appointed . <P> Now the Army has decided to organize other Negro squadrons , but Judge Hastie declared that the training of their technical crews is likely to be far behind the training of pilots . Meanwhile , Negro pilots already qualified are hindered in training because the Army Air Forces is unwilling to let them take cross-country flights which might set them down on fields where they would get the privileges of the officers ' club . <P> By speaking his piece , Judge Hastie had put his finger on an Army-wide problem that already has resulted in many a round of fisticuffs and occasional disorder and insubordination . Although long-standing white prejudice against the Negro could not be dissolved by Government fiat , Judge Hastie 's airing did his cause no harm .
