txt More than half a year . after Austria 's liberation most of this country 's vexing economic problems are still a long way from solution . Indeed , on some of the worst ones not even a start has been made . This slowness in doing anything about getting Austria onto a sound economic footing  --  a fact recognized by all Anglo-American officials here  --  has just been empha- arise when the same requests are made to neutral states which today hold this property and assets . According to reliable reports , the neutrals concerned are chiefly Switzerland , Sweden , Spain , Turkey , and ? Latin American atates , including Argentina . Switzerland generally is assumed to be the largest holder of German assets . And Switzerland is said to be one of the strongest resisters to Allied requests that such German assets be handed over . Two arguments are advanced  --  namely , special banking-secrecy laws which forbid divulging such information and that the Germans owe debts to Swiss firms , incurred in the ordinary way of business before and during the war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be first applied to settlement of these debts . The Swiss have taken steps toward clarification of the situation when , at the demand of the Allies , they froze all German assets within their frontiers and months later  --  last July  --  made a census of holdings of ' enemies of the Allies . The . results of these investigations ; according to information nere , have not yet been submitted to the Allies . Whether the next step will be for the Allies formally to request that both information and actual assets be forthcoming by a special date remains to be seen . If either this step is not taken or when taken is refused by the Swiss and other neutrals holding such assets of Germany , the Allies will be in a difficult position . A great deal of information undoubtedly can be obtained by them From sources already at their disposal , but there actually are not sufficient non-Nazis to do these jobs . Nor can such persons be members of existing political parties at the present time . Commenting on such proposals , Der Morgen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dealing with this problem three basic facts should not be forgotten : All illegality should be strictly banned , since we are again in a state governed by law . We should not seek to apply methods we condemned in others . And finally , this truth always should be kept before our eyes ? as in international life , so in the life of each nation , sure peace and the conditions of permanent reconciliation never are achieved through hate and revenge . " Just as the way , . now is open for former Nazis of the third class to participate in the restoration of Germany 's communal life , the article concluded , " so we as a notion expect . in a future not too distant , it is to be hoped , the same from our opponents of yesterday in respect to our restoration into the community of nations . " The Allied Control Council 's edict specifically exempted Austrians or citizens of other countries " annexed or claimed to have been annexed by Germany since Dec. 31 , 1937 .

The term " person " was defined as including also groups of individuals as well as " any government , including political subdivisions , public corporations , agencies , and instrumentalities thereof , " The work of gathering and recording evidence on foreign assets within the four zones of occupa tion was made the responsibility of zonal commanders in chief . The question of whether any compensation should be made to persons divested of property was left to a future decision of the control council . One major disposition may be ti pay reparations to the United States . The first effective practical steps toward in-. suring that war claims of the Allied nations " shall be met . . . from appropriate German external assets " now are announced in an official statement here to the effect that those assets now are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Big Four powers . Thus they are beginning to apply one of the most important economic decisions laid down in the Potsdam agreement of last July . Under it , German citizens have been deprived of all titles . rights , and interests in any property , movable or immovable , outside Germany . It becomes Allied property , and as such is invested in and will be managed by the new German External Property Commission . The assets which they thus will control may be valued ' at from $800,000,000 to $1,000 , - 1 000,000 . Any ; question of later compensation will be decided by the Control Commission , which now is declared the legally constituted body " to operate , control , or exercise in any way authority over this property . " Not subject to this new law are assets subject to the jurisdiction of the United Nations . Simultaneously , however , the commission is empowered to require information , evidence , and records regarding any property outside Germany .
