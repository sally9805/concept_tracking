" I do not like the Daily Mirror . I never have liked it . I do not like that form of journalism at all . . . . I do n't find it necessary to indulge in that form of pornography . " <P> With these words Britain 's Laborite M.P . Aneurin Bevan ( not to be confused with Labor Minister Ernest Bevin ) last week went to the defense of freedom of the press in Britain . In the same debate in the House of Commons many another pungent word was spoken , for the fact was-and Britain was awakening to it-that wartime freedom of the press in the English-speaking world was now actually , openly and seriously threatened . <P> In the House redheaded Minister of Information Brendan Bracken announced a new censorship on news exported from Britain : instead of limiting censorship of dispatches sent overseas to military information , British censors are now empowered to kill anything " calculated to create ill feeling between the United Nations or between them and a neutral country " - including matter that has been published by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been guilty of censoring outgoing press dispatches on a similar basis , but last week the U.S. went a step further and also ordered the censoring of U.S. periodicals sent out of the country ( including TIME Air Express ) . <P> These two new kinds of censorship , whether wise or unwise , do not affect freedom of the press within either Britain or the U.S. But they came simultaneously with a broad attack on press freedom by the Churchill Government . <P> Home Secretary Herbert Morrison , who threatened fortnight ago to gag the London Daily Mirror 's caustic criticism of the Government ( TIME , March 30 ) , instead of backing down under the fierce drubbing which was administered to him by virtually the entire British press and a good part of the House of Commons , returned to the attack , under an even fiercer drubbing . <P> To a tempestuous House , Cockney Morrison announced that he would " take any action in my power against any newspaper which conducts itself in such a way as to promote opposition to the successful conduct of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mirror goes on with the pernicious line it has conducted , I tell the House it will be suppressed and the Government , having done that , will submit itself to the judgment of the House . . . . If the House has a division on such an issue and I go down , I will go down-and out . " <P> No one accused the Mirror of divulging military information ( hitherto the sole topic of British censorship ) . The crime of the Mirror was in criticizing the Government , the productive effort and the efficiency of the Army-criticizing it continuously , bitterly and intemperately . ( Sample attack on the Army by the Mirror 's " Cassandra " : " At the top you have the military aristocracy of the Guards ' regiments with a mentality not very foreign to that of Potsdam . In the center you have a second-class snobocracy and behind it all the cloying inertia of the Civil Service bogged down by regulations from which they can not extricate themselves .
