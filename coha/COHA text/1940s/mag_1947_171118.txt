" Kashmir without an equal-Kashmir , equal to paradise ! " generations of Indian pilgrims have chanted . But the destruction that wasted India did not spare Kashmir . Last week Kashmir , the paradisal valley , smoked with two kinds of hellish fury : war and its blinder brother , massacre . <P> " Free Kashmir . " All through the summer , Kashmir 's waddling , toss-purse Hindu Maharaja Sir Hari Singh had twisted &; turned between India and Pakistan . When armed tribesmen from Pakistan 's northwest invaded last month , Sir Hari at last threw out his be jeweled arms to India . <P> In Moslem Karachi , Pakistan Governor General Mohamed Ali Jinnah raged at the news . He ordered Pakistan troops , under British Lieut . General D. D. Gracey , into Kashmir . The order was not carried out , for in New Delhi British Field Marshal Sir Claude Auchinleck threatened to withdraw British officers from Pakistan 's Army . <P> The raiders from Pakistan were amazingly well equipped . They used automatic guns , mortars , . 3.7-in. field guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian Dominion , flown in to hold the Maharaja 's capital at Srinagar , the down-at-heel " Venice of the Orient , " tried strafing the invaders from Spitfires of the Indian Air Force . But the raiders were through the outlying passes now and inside the lovely Vale of Kashmir itself . They pressed closer on Srinagar , and , on the march , proclaimed Azad Kashmir-Free Kashmir . <P> " Is Pakistan Too Weak ? " Even more ominous were the reports that the blind butchery of neighbor by neighbor had reached Kashmir . Pakistan heard that 50,000 Moslems had been slaughtered by Hindus . British officials said that 100,000 fleeing refugees from Kashmir and nearby Jammu had crowded south into the still reeking Punjab . <P> Heretofore , British and Europeans had been fairly safe . But they were no longer safe in Kashmir . Mahsud tribesmen burst into a hospital at Baramulla last week , killed a British officer , his wife and two nuns . <P> Rather late , the Maharaja of Kashmir took measures to prop up his throne .

In New Delhi this week Prime Minister Nehru called for a U.N . plebiscite , shouted : " Is the Pakistan Government too weak to prevent armies from marching across its territory to invade another country ? " <P> Sex &; Christianity . Britons in Kashmir began to pack . At the Srinagar Club there were tea dancing and dinner jackets as usual , but the residents were signing up for planes and road convoys that would take them south , like Sir Hari Singh . One trouble was the pet dogs , the Lhassa terriers , Afghan hounds and Pomeranians . Transportation was short , and , it turned out , there were more dogs than Britons on the evacuation list .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
