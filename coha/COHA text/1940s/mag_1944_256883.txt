The University of Chicago 's President Robert Maynard Hutchins resigned last week from his university 's faculty ( Quadrangle ) club , and other members were forming their battle lines along the Midway . Reason : for the first time in years , the Quadrangle Club had blackballed a candidate . <P> The candidate was tall , balding Gordon Dupee , 28 , research director of the University 's radio office , which produces Round Table . Presumptive reasons for the blackballing : 1 ) Dupee is a forthright conscientious objector ( though 4-F ) ; 2 ) only a short time ago , as a working student , he was the club 's steward . The club council insisted , however , that Applicant Dupee had been rejected simply because he is " personally objectionable . " Cracked a member : " Hell , everybody in the club is objectionable to everybody else in it-and rightly so . " <P> It was doubted that many members would resign , like President Hutchins . One facultyman explained : " There is n't any place else to eat around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
