Private Opinion &; Public Duty <P> Sirs : <P> Your paragraphs about the " psychological front " of the U.S. Army TIME , July 28 are interesting , in that the writer fears that the reported 50-50 **28;1668;TOOLONG conversational standoff is important . It is n't . Americans will do their duty by the U.S. Government whether that Government seems to them as individuals to be mistaken or not . As one of the few generally educated peoples of the world , we do not have to be indoctrinated with interventionism to do a good job for America . I happen to be an isolationist of the " hemispheric defense " school of thought , but that does not mean that I , and others like me , are not willing to serve our country as the constituted authorities deem fit . Private political opinion is a healthy thing . The privilege of holding such opinion without fear is worth fighting for . Above all , we believe in and will fight for the U.S.-right or wrong . <P> F. H. BUCK JR . <P> Berkeley , Calif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sirs : <P> In your issue of July 21 , you gave a fine story of the progress made by the Department of Agriculture in gaining control of the farming element of the nation . You state in almost so many words that the Department expects soon to control all agricultural activities except the minor details . And further on in the article you suggest that through the control of agriculture , control of all business will be obtained . If this is true and I believe you are correct , it means that the Government will have the power of complete control over every individual life in the nation . If that is to come to pass in America why should we fight Hitler ? . . . <P> J. S. COPPOC <P> McDonald , Kans . <P> Sirs : <P> Surely you have hit an all-time high in context , reporting and editing in your article on Agriculture in the issue of July 21 . . . . Reprint this same article a million strong and see that every university in the land has copies , to enable every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . It is excellent in every way , even to the deft sense of humor running through the description of the various men involved . . . . <P> J. MAXWELL KENNARD <P> New York City <P> Wedgwood <P> Sirs : <P> . . . You refer TIME , July 28 to Colonel Josiah Wedgwood as a " china merchant " and " potter . " In point of fact Colonel Wedgwood has never been actively connected with the family business . The reason is that the three brothers who owned the business between 1870 and 1890 drew up a partnership agreement which allowed each one to introduce only one son into the firm . Colonel Wedgwood 's eldest brother was chosen for the honor , and the two younger sons were automatically excluded . <P> Colonel Wedgwood 's career shows some of the extraordinary vesatility of his distinguished ancestor , and it would be correct , as a result , to refer to him as a naval architect , a gallant army officer , an able historian , a tax expert , or a skillful parliamentarian , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . .
