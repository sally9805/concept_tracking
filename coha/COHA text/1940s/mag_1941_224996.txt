Tough-fibered little Sidney Hillman , who has so far survived all the violent winds of controversy in Washington , last week met a hurricane that threatened to blow him away . <P> Transplanted from a comfortable C.I.O. clothing workers ' union to the windiest spot in the capital , Mr. Hillman was given the vast assignment of the defense program 's labor problems . Shrewd , resilient , he has bent before gales but still held fast until a dispute started in the Federal Works Agency . <P> As part of its defense-housing program , FWA , planning to put up 300 houses in Detroit , asked for bids . The big Currier Lumber Co. of Detroit was $216,000 under its nearest rival . One reason : Currier 's houses were prefabricated ( factory-made in sections , to be assembled on the site ) . Although a housing shortage is one of the scandals of the defense program , A.F. of L. building unions have fought prefabrication from the start . They saw the new , streamlined process displacing their craftsmen with factory workers , their ancient union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Furthermore , Currier Co. employes had just been organized by C.I.O. The news of the Currier bid was hardly out when John Michael Carmody , FWA head , got a call from a Detroit official of the A.F. of L. Building Trades Department . Had Mr. Carmody forgotten the stabilization agreement signed last summer by OPM and A.F. of L. Building Trades ? In return for certain concessions , which included a promise to end work stoppages , OPM had granted A.F. of L. a virtual monopoly in the building field . Marred by a few wildcat strikes by a few undisciplined workers , the agreement had worked out pretty well , by &; large . Was the Currier contract going to be allowed to spoil this happy state of affairs ? <P> From Washington presently came a strangled cry : to give the contract to Currier would cause " a reign of terror " in the building trades in Michigan . In other words , A.F. of L. would probably strike $50,000,000 worth of building in the Detroit area , to say nothing of what it might do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the responsibility of making the final decision . Although the Currier Co. had already started work , Mr. Hillman ordered its contract withheld . Then came the hurricane . <P> From C.I.O. came charges that Hillman " with stealthy efforts " was trying to make a deal with A.F. of L. , was perpetrating " intolerable conditions that have retarded the progress of this industry . " Congressman Howard Worth Smith demanded that A.F. of L. and the labor division of OPM ( Mr. Hillman ) be indicted for conspiracy to defraud the Government . Justice 's trust-busting Thurman Wesley Arnold pawed the ground . The Truman Committee in the Senate , investigating the defense program , got ready to charge . <P> Nevertheless , Mr. Hillman was still prepared to maintain that the stabilization agreement was worth preserving . It had kept the construction program running on an even keel . The U.S. was halfway through a $10,000,000,000 building program ; now certainly was not the time for revolution in the building field . He was not willing to foster or provoke a bitter labor war .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
