Rome was taken , and Rome was barely scarred . To most of the world these were the important facts about the capture of the first European capital retaken from the Germans . But General Sir Harold R. L. G. Alexander and his conquering troops were busy with another , further fact : Kesselring 's Army , battered , tired and in retreat , could still be destroyed . Alexander 's troops surged through and around Rome and pressed the pursuit northward. * <P> Beyond Rome the three main highways leading north were clogged with German motor equipment . Alexander 's tactical air force tore savagely into them with guns and bombs . In the hills and fields , German foot soldiers backed northward , fighting stubbornly while the main bodies sped away from trouble . Allied units pressed closely . At one point they lost contact entirely with the retreating enemy , closed up fast to regain it . <P> It was no time to stop and throw hats in the air , as the populace in Rome was doing . For military men there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had pulled out and swung away from the city when his resistance faltered . Grant followed , drove him to the end at Appomattox . Thus Harold Alexander hoped to finish off his foe . <P> Pattern of Defeat . Technically , Field Marshal Albert Kesselring 's Tenth and Fourteenth Armies were still in one piece . But they had been fearfully cut up . Since the drive began on May 11 they had had around 60,000 casualties ; more than 20,000 had been captured ; at least five of their 18 divisions had ceased to function . <P> Said Alexander 's Fifth Army commander , Lieut . General Mark Clark : " One of Kesselring 's two armies will never fight again . " It was about all he had time to say . He was in charge of the pursuit north from Rome .

TIME Correspondent Will Lang had spent the night in a dugout under fire . At dawn he piled out and headed up in a jeep toward the sound of firing on Via Casilina . He cabled : <P> " Within a mile we caught up with a column of eight tanks . . . . Their backs were loaded with troops . Some had parachute silk kerchiefs knotted around their heads , and some wore bandannas . They were armed to the teeth . Sitting carelessly atop the tanks , unshaven and sweaty , they looked like pirates . <P> " There were three pistol shots from somewhere . The tanks stopped and I saw one of the infantrymen pointing his gun down a side road . There a helmetless German stumbled out into the open , hands in the air . His right wrist had been shattered by a bullet and from his upraised arm the hand dangled by a few bloody shreds of raw flesh . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the rear , went on . <P> " We passed two German officers headed along to our prison stockade , passed a column of young dandies on bicycles , a young Italian bridal couple , the bride trim and shapely in a grey suit adorned by a bright nosegay.
