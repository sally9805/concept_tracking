Economic schoolboys love to argue over who is the world 's most powerful industrialist . Last week the argument could almost be regarded as settled . The winner : beer-bellied , red-faced , medal-breasted Hermann Gring . <P> In 1937 the high-living Marshal had run out of pocket change . So his old steel friends in the Ruhr dropped a hint : for a license under the Four-Year Plan to develop Salzgitter 's low-grade iron deposits , they would pay off his debts . But Planner Gring had a better plan : he decided to get into the steel business himself , boasted that he would make his company " the greatest industrial enterprise in the world . " How good Gring has made his boast was told last week in Social Research by Dr. Kurt Lachmann , ex-London correspondent of the Frankfurter Zeitung , now in Manhattan . <P> Gring 's rise is a study in speed . By decree ( July 23 , 1937 ) he took over low-grade iron deposits in Salzgitter . Two days later and with $2,000,000 ( at 40 to a mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gring Works to compete with his steel friends in the Ruhr . With the help of famed U. S. Engineer Herman Alexander Brassert , he built a smelter , a rolling mill , a canal over ten miles long , houses for 150,000 workmen . Then , like a geyser , the Gring Works shot up into a vertical trust , overflowed in every direction : into coal fields in Upper Silesia , gravel pits , quarries , lignite mines east of the Elbe , lime deposits in Bavaria , refractory materials in Upper Palatinate . Aiming at power-in-general rather than any organic industrial shape , the Gring trust next spread into oil fields , commercia houses , shipping companies . In 1938 the capital jumped to $160,000,000 . The next year Fritz Thyssen abdicated . Under a decree which permits the State to seize " communistic property , " Industrialist Gring took over Thyssen 's holdings in the Vereinigte Stahlwerke , the anything-but-communistic mills in Mullheim ( largest in Germany ) . <P> Meanwhile , on foreign fronts Gring 's trust followed the troops . From the Austrian National Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's leading automobile and former armament company ( Steyr-Daimler-Puch A. G. ) , . the Danube steamship company , a railroad car factory . After a struggle , the Thyssen group coughed up Alpine Montangesell-schaft A. G. , No.1 Austrian steel company . In exchange , the Thyssen group got shares in a synthetic oil plant . In charge of his Austrian properties Gring put Guido Schmidt , who as Austrian Foreign Minister had made reservations for Kurt von Schuschnigg in the Hotel Metropole , his post-Anschluss prison . Other Gring acquisitions : <P> &gt; In Czecho-Slovakia , one-half the lignite mines , the Vitkovice iron &; steel works ( once owned jointly by the Rothschilds and the Gutmanns of Vienna ) . &gt;On the Board of Rumania 's largest iron &; steel works ( Reshitza ) Gring put his nephew , Albert Gring , took over the selling outlets of Skoda in Rumania. * &gt; In Norway , the Dunderland iron-ore mines ( subsidiary of an English company , capitalized at 700,000 ) .                 @ @ @ @
