A fortnight ago , in a swivet of anti-Yanqui hysteria , Panama 's National Assembly unanimously rejected the U.S.-proposed treaty for 14 defense bases on Panamanian territory . Last week , to Panama 's astonishment , the U.S. promptly ordered its armed forces to vacate all bases outside the U.S.-controlled Canal Zone , including the big bomber base at Rio Hata . <P> The Army &; Navy were confident they would be asked back-but not until after the national elections next June . Meantime , not even Panama 's hottest hothead could find the breath to yell " Yanqui imperialism ! "
