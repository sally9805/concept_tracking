In 28 hours ' flying time the Anzac Clipper , camouflaged for day flying and blacked out at night , clocked 4,350 statute miles last week , bringing U.S. Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles home in record time from the Rio de Janeiro Conference of American foreign ministers . <P> Although an immediate unanimous diplomatic rupture with the Axis had been thwarted by Chilean-Argentine opposition . Statesman Welles and such other notable statesmen as Brazil 's President Getulio Vargas and Foreign Minister Oswaldo Aranha , Mexico 's Foreign Minister Ezequiel Padilla and Uruguay 's Alberto Guan had given new meaning to the term Americanism . They had preserved the moral unity of the 21 Nations , driven Axis diplomats from 19 of them , and throttled Axis trade . With resolutions calling for economic mobilization and the unification of hemisphere defenses , they had begun the task of making America economically and physically impregnable . <P> No Free Trade . Resolutions affecting intercontinental economy recommended the prevention of sharp increases in the price of export products and the granting of preferential treatment for nations needing access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indicated at first that the preferential treatment might mean eventual hemisphere free trade-with inevitable opposition from U.S. interests traditionally linked with protective tariffs . An official U.S. reservation , included in the 66-page final text of Conference decisions , spiked this report by declaring that the terms of the resolution " are inconsistent with the . . . liberal principles of international trade maintained by the U.S. " <P> This proviso , however , was offset by recommendations and the setting up of machinery for the prompt interchange of strategic materials because of the " imperative character and extreme urgency of the existing situation " - in effect a freeze-out of whatever Axis trade remained . <P> Realistic measures of defense called for elimination of telecommunications with the Axis countries , closer passport inspection , control of Axis-owned businesses ( on which Argentina and Chile submitted a reservation ) ; and stricter surveillance of local Nazi groups , which openly brag of loyalty to the Fatherland even though a German colonist " wears a sombrero and spurs as wide as wagon wheels . " <P> Not Perfect . As airtight as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Article 22 , which declared : " The principle that international conduct must be inspired by the policy of the Good Neighbor is the norm of international law on the American continent . " This Good Neighbor diplomacy reached its peak at the Conference 's concluding plenary session in Tiradentes Palace . Brazil 's Aranha , scarcely able to control the excitement in his bass voice , announced to stomping , cheering crowds that Brazil , largest and strategically the most important of the South American countries had " . . . at 6 o'clock today broken her diplomatic and commercial relations with Germany , Italy and Japan . " After settlement of the old boundary dispute with Peru Ecuador followed suit .
