It all sounded innocent enough at the start . Pennsylvania 's leading GOPoliticos had decided to give a little dinner for Governor James H. Duff at Washington 's swank 1925 F Street Club . Senator Ed Martin , who is the real Republican leader of Pennsylvania , turned up with a select group of capital headliners , including Senators Taft and Vandenberg and General Dwight Eisenhower . Aged Joe Grundy arrived from Pennsylvania with a train of lesser politicians and their wives . After a sumptuous dinner , the ladies retired and the gentlemen fired up their cigars . Then somebody suddenly dispelled the air of pleasant sociability . <P> The somebody was General Eisenhower . Before the conversational ball had really started rolling , Ike grabbed it and hurled it right down the political alley . The nation , said Ike , needs new and dynamic leadership . It faces great peril and it will require a crusading spirit of deed and sacrifice if it is to win through . <P> As Ike went on , Bob Taft 's face turned pink , then an angry red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G.O.P. leadership , nor the fact that that criticism had been uttered in the presence of the men who will control Pennsylvania 's potent delegation to the G.O.P. convention next June . But Eisenhower plowed right ahead . <P> He touched on some specific points . The aid program to Europe , he said , must move and move fast . At the same time , inflation must be stopped in its tracks . Labor must be told that it must not increase inflationary , pressures by further wage boosts . Management must become aware of the importance of reducing prices . Above all , said Ike pointedly , leadership must assert itself . <P> The minute Eisenhower had finished , Taft was on his feet . It was all very well , he snapped , to talk in generalities . " When you come to writing legislation , there is where you get into trouble . " How would the General write down the specific details of an anti-inflation program ? Just how would he go about it ? <P> A noticeable chill settled over the room . Eisenhower looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at both . Then Ike answered that he had some specific ideas in mind , but there was not time to go into them . On that note the party broke up . <P> Said one participant later : " There is not the slightest shadow of a doubt in my mind that Eisenhower is running for President . There is n't any doubt either that he seized upon this occasion to register that impression with Pennsylvania political leaders . "
