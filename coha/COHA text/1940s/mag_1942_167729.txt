The largest U.S. troop shipment yet sent to the British Isles in World War II landed in Northern Ireland last week . <P> There were thousands of them-leggy , strapping , bronzed fellows . They marched through Northern Ireland 's streets and lanes with silent , rubber-heeled tread that still seems impressively American to hard-heeled Britons . They rumbled through towns and across fields in rubber-treaded tanks ; for the first time Britons at home saw the U.S. Armored Force in action . <P> The job they were to do was still a secret . For the moment they served to release British troops for use elsewhere , to insure all Ireland against Nazi attack . Eventually , when many many more thousands had come to join them , they might help to open a second front . The U.S. was deploying its pieces upon the board .
