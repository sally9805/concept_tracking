The green-garbed German officer was abruptly firm : the Fuhrer would not tolerate delay . For the last time handsome , sad-eyed Leopold III looked down from his Laeken palace-prison on swans nodding whitely in a blue lake , on the withering bloom of purple rhododendrons beneath stately beeches . Stiffly he turned , walked out to a waiting car , climbed in beside his commoner second wife ( to whom he had given the title Princess de Rthy ) . As helpless as any of the 600,000 Belgians who had preceded him , the King of the Belgians was deported to Germany . <P> Just four years had passed since German might and Allied weakness forced young Leopold ( then 39 ) to surrender himself and his armies to the Wehrmacht . <P> Last week in London exiled Belgian Prime Minister Hubert Pierlot broadcast to Belgians : " The enemy . . . hastens to put the finishing touch on his work of disorganization and destruction of the state . . . . On the deliverance of Belgium . . . the King will recover . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirmed Allied support of the exiled Government . If the Germans had hoped to wreck Allied plans for Belgium by spiriting away the King , they had failed . <P> No Simple Matter . The restoration of Belgium will be difficult . Allied plans call for an election as soon as feasible after liberation . But every fourth voter has been deported to Germany . A majority of them will have to be returned before the voting . In a total 2,670 communes , 2,300 quisling mayors have been put in power . They will have to be ousted , replaced by trustworthies before normal order is regained . From the 45-mile sea-coast 180,000 people have been shoved inland . They must be returned . Wrecked residential and industrial areas must be rebuilt . Belgian railways , looted by Germany , must be rehabilitated . <P> Belgium also has political problems . The Socialist Party , the second largest , has drawn up a list of social reforms , and the exiled Government has agreed to many of them . But on one point there is deep disagreement . Belgium 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmly committed to the monarchy . Almost to a man , BeHan Socialists want to be rid of Leopold . They do not mind having a king , but they have had no use for Leopold since his surrender .
