txt WITH AN AMERICAN INFANTRY . DIVISION , in Tunisia , May ** morning the field guns start to bark , the bombers unload with a rolling roar on the enemy positions , the machine guns chatter and the soldiers of this division move forward to attack one more hill . Generally , 4 that hill is taken by nightfall . For , after more than a week , the troops have smashed thirteen miles over the roughest kind of country north of Medjez-el-Bab , driving a crack German infantry division before them . They have been fighting steadily since January . They are confident , skilled and " professional . " Thirteen miles may not seem like much . But one should see the country . The hills vary . At one point there is a rock ridge rising 180 feet from the top of a steep hill  --  a saw-toothed position from which the Germans could not be driven by shellfire . It had to be taken by hand-to-hand fighting ? grim , bitter fighting in which boys who a couple of years ago one might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive the Germans down into the valley beyond . Look Easy From Distance There are other hills , less forbidding but just as hard to take . Through field glasses they look almost gentle , green , symmetrical and quiet in the sun . Then , as something moves on a little valley in front , they suddenly break out with spots of fire . Each spot is some sort of gun-88-mm. , 105-mm. or heavy machine guns . Then our own guns begin anew . If one is close , the sound hits one like a clout on the ear . The roar bounces back off the hills and rolls down the valleys . Sometimes one can see the shells bursting on the hills . Then the infantry moves forward again , going steadily and heavily toward the first line of the German defenses at the bottom of the hill . Machine-gun teams manhandle their guns into position . A man drops here and there . The rest go forward with simple , steady courage until they reach the first German line and the real fighting and dying begin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot in the little valleys . Often , if they have been beaten off by day , these troops come back at night to attack again . It is that kind of a division . They go in silently at night , surprising the weary Germans with a line of yelling men , their bayonets agleam in the starlight . Mines explode and the whole hill bursts into fire , with red tracer bullets etching a pattern against the black bulk of the hill and rifle fire rippling from flank to flank . Because there are men who would drive a truck through hell , food gets up . Sometimes the frontline troops get hot food only late at night , when the cook truck heaves its way over bumpy tracks . During the day they munch field ' rations whenever they have a chance and drink sparingly from their canteens . Water is scarce in the fighting zone . It must be brought up with the food during the night , when the enemy 's lines shell the - roads . Patrols Active at Night If no attack has been planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through enemy minefields or " jumping " sentries . Men off duty hack shallow trenches behind their positions and sleep heavily a few hundred yards from the enemy . All the time reports stream back to the headquarters of the divisional general . Little knots of officers hunch over maps , figuring out just how this mortar position or that 88 is to be taken next day , just where the artillery fire should be directed . Occasionally the enemy pays a night visit , dropping flares to spot our positions . The troops huddle in the trenches under the white light . The drone of Junkers dies in the distance and the battlefield is still , except for an odd shot or two in the distance . It is a stimulating experience to talk to these soldiers . They know " the flying bullet down the pass that whistles clear : ' All flesh is grass . ' " Yet they have a magnificent , calm confidence and courage . The things of which one hears  --  one man , alone and wounded , cleaning out a German position with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-fire  --  have an antique splendor . They say : " Oh hell , it was just part of the job , " or occasionally : " Listen , this here 's the best damned division in the Army . We can do that stuff any time . " Down at El Guettar they stopped the Tenth German Armored Division cold as a good Martini . They are proud of that  --  as their letters home show : " Well , Dad , we stopped the best they have . * * 5 " Their Outlook Professional As they grind forward through the hills they know that there is " plenty more to do when- this is finished . " They view this campaign and the whole war with the calm detachment of the professional soldier . When they come out of the line they peel off their shirts to get tan ; talk or write home , or sing melancholy ditties like any other young men of their ages . But then an order comes and they go forward again . Their bodies bend a little as they come under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best they have " ? meet them and beat them . Behind the open battle that surges over these narrow valleys lies the battle between the German and Allied engineers . The former strive to check the steady progress of the Allied forces with mines ; the latter seek a new way to detect and eliminate the mines , which are as heavy here as ever they were in the North Sea . Enemy mine fields have influenced the course of this campaign just as they affected the battlei in the Western Desert . Since the Allied offensive started on April 22 they have been of great aid to the enemy , seriously hampering the Allied advance in many ways . Just how many mines have been laid by the enemy no one knows , but the figure must be astronomical . There are at least half a dozen enemy minefields in the rear of the Second United States Corps , whose engineers opened a path through them . They are slowly being gathered up . Here and there along the roads one sees six-foot piles of enemy mines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an admirable artillery position . " There are more than 400 mines on the approaches to that hill and the hill itself , " he said . " Jerry knew we 'd want to use it for a gun position . " Because of the work of this engineer and his British colleagues , a way has been cleared through the mines . Most of this work is done under enemy fire and casualties are heavy , yet , as the engineer pointed out , they are " not as heavy as they 'd be if we did n't dig them out . " Plain Probably Well Mined Although there has been optimism over the chances of a speedy dash into Tunis once the Allied armor has reached the plain , this plain almost certainly contains several belts of mines . The tanks will probably be able to go only as fast as the engineers , although the enemy may leave gaps through which his own tanks will try to sally for counter-attacks . Moreover , the Allied engineers say , " every bridge that has not been destroyed , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mined and houses and stores are planted with ' booby traps . ' " Here is an illustration how a bridge can be mined by the enemy . There will be mines at the entrance to the bridge , with a detonator farther along the bridge , so that the first vehicle to cross will blow itself up with the bridge . If there is a ford near by , ' this too will be mined . So will areas suitable for starting a new bridge across the river . Working fast , engineers can clear such an area in a day . They have done so in the past with cold courage that had nothing of the spectacular but that - won.the admiration of the infantry throughout the battle zone . There are dozens of different types of mines . For instance , there is the " ' SSS " mine , which is topped by three prongs . When one of these is stepped on by a man , the mine jumps into the air to waist height and then explodes , scattering bullets for a considerable distance . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an enemy foxhole . If the advancing infantryman does not step on the mine , but passes near it , the German in the foxhole sets it off .
