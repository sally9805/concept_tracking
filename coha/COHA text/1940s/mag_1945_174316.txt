With G.I.s overseas , the biggest attraction on radio is a pretty , breezy blonde with a high-school-fresh voice named Martha Wilkerson . Most U.S. civilians never heard of her-but from Kodiak to Canberra , Martha is a top G.I. favorite . Last week , with her 870th broadcast , Martha Wilkerson could boast of receiving one-fourth of all the fan mail inspired by the Armed Forces Radio Service 's 122 air shows . <P> Recording six days a week in Los Angeles , Martha Wilkerson uses the aeronym , " G.I. Jill . " Her transcriptions , flown out in six-day batches by A.F.R.S. , are tenderly passed from one mosquito network to the next . The show also goes by short wave to Europe , Africa , Australia , the Aleutians , and war zones between and beyond . For good reason her closing line is : " Good morning to some of you , good afternoon to some more of you , and to the rest of you-good night . " <P> G.L Jill 's formula is simple : she plays jazz records by request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tells gags , babbles brightly on almost any subject . Sample opening to sailors : " Hiya , fellas . This is Jill again , all set to rock the bulkheads on the old jukebox and shoot the breeze to the sons of Mother Carey . . . . " <P> The response is tremendous . Servicemen shower her with grass skirts and invasion money ; they cable money for yellow roses ; they write that she is " romantic and groovey " and " my ideal . " One fan , irresistibly reminded of his wife , requested that Jill simply say : " The mashed potatoes are ready . " <P> G.I. Jill 's show is an outgrowth of an OWI radio program begun in 1942 with her husband , ex-Radioman Mort Werner . As " Jack and Jill " they served up a mixture of jazz and banter called Hi , Neighbor . A.F.R.S. took over the program in the spring of 1943 . Soon Jill ( minus Jack ) was doing a solo act called G.I. Jive ( now AEF Jukebox ) . <P> As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of counterirritant to " Tokyo Rose . " Servicemen who listen regularly to both programs assure Jill that hers is superior . For one thing , Rose 's records are mostly old and scratchy . But the explanation may be more basic . The fair flower of Tokyo exerts herself mightily to make U.S. servicemen homesick ; G.I. Jill 's trick is to make them feel at home .
