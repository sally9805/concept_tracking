txt How can the Federal budget be brought into balance ? What can be done about the tact that most citizens directly see the effects of spending but only indirectly feel the consequences of taxation ? How can the unorganized pressures for more economy in government ever be made to catch up with organized pressures for more appropriations by government ? Fresh light on answers to these questions which ' are concerning every member of Congress who is trying to bring the budget under control is provided today in the first estimates of the total number of 1940 United States Income taxpayers . The significant figures are these : A Federal personal income tax will be paid this year by only about 3,500,000 persons . One In 15 Need Filo Related to the total population of the country , this means that there are 38 times as many persons of all ages who do not pay a Federal income tax as do , and that only one voting citizen in 15 need file any Federal tax return at all. , Thus these figures bring into focus one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more orderly Federal financing . That barrier is best described as visible spending and invisible taxing . It is a condition created by the fact , vividly illustrated by current income tax returns , that an overwhelming majority of voters ? at least 15 to one  --  experience no direct tax from the Federal Government . ConseqUently , the Federal Government is in the position of spending open-handedly the revenue which it acquires with the taxpayers hardly realizing it . This is a basic weakness of Federal financing with which Congress is confronted . The 1940 budget is a concrete illustration . This year , for example , the Government is disbursing about $9 , - 000,000,000 . Little more than $2 , - 000,000,000 of this amount will be received from income and estate taxes and approximately another $800,000,000 from direct taxes on employers and employees . Where does the remainder of this $9,000,000,000 come from ? It comes the easy way  --  temporarily easy , at least . About $2,000,000,000 of it is obtained from invisible taxes on consumption , and most of the remainder comes from the invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned , painless method of borrowing . In other words , one-third of the Government 's large expenditures are derived from taxes which are visible and noticeable  --  but visible and noticeable to a relatively small number of voters . Two-thirds of the Government 's expenditures are obtained by fiscal methods ' which convey no tangible sense of tax responsibility upon the voters , This vast revenue comes from indirect taxes , which are heavy but unseen , and borrowing which , politically , is the easiest money of all . It is for these reasons that Congress is finding that wide reform in taxing and budgeting methods must accompany any effective approach toward reducing the Federal deficit . The current estimates of 1940 Federal income tax returns underline at various points the limited extent to which direct tax responsibility comes home to the citizen . On the basis of the returns of previous years it is estimated that this year : Five per cent of all income taxpayers will pay 58 per cent of the total income tax collected . Two per cent of all income taxpayers will pay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half per cent will pay 11 per cent of the total . Fourteen per cent will pay 7 pet cent of the total tax . Three fourths of the taxable returns will be under $5,000 , and this largest group will pay 6 per cent of the total tax . The relatively small number o : income-tax payers in the United States  --  this year probably about 3,500,000 ? is re-directing attention to the demand that exemptions be lowered . The objective of this step , advocated by Senator Robert La-Follette of Wisconsin , is not to place heavier tax burdens upon the lowest - income groups , but rather to let direct and visible taxation take the place of indirect and invisible taxation so as to extend tax consciousness to the greatest possible body of the electorate . Senator La Follette has estimated that lowering the levels of exemptions to $800 for single and $2000 for married persons would produce 1,400,000 more direct taxpayers and about $110,000,000 more revenue annually .                    @
