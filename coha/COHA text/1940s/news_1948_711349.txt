txt While Clyde Loftin , 39 , one or the crack guards of the San Quentin penitentiary in California , who came to Chicago to pick up a prisoner , dozed yesterday on a bench in the Congress street subwax station , a thief stole trom him : 1 . His wallet containing $480. the warrant for his prisoner , and c/Yde Loftin his penitentiary badge . 2 . His handbag containing a brand new set of leg irons and handcuffs . The frantic and crestfallen Loftin , a husky man , spent a fruitless hour roaming the area in a search for his despoiler before he finally appeared at the Central police station to make a complaint . His Story Does n't Hold Up During that Hour , in an effort to save face , Loftin concocted a story of having been sandbagged from behind and robbed . But neither his hat nor his head showed any sign of having absorbed a knockout blow . In addition , two subway guards , Henry HoHnieister , 36 , and Jack Beck , 19 , both recalled seeing Loftin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many blushes , Loftin admitted his belongings were pilfered while he - was asleep . " I 'll probably get laughed right out of the ' pen , ' " Loftin told Sgt. Pat Loughran . " All I can hope is the ' cons ' do n't hear what happened . They 'll be trying to steal my watch . " An Unwarranted Predicament But of more pressing worry to Loftin was the matter of a warrant for his prisoner , Gustave Lindt , , now in the county jail , recently arrested here at the request of California authorities for violation of parole . Until the guard gets a proper warrant , the prisoner will remain in the county jail . And then there 's the matter of more funds and a new set of leg irons and handcuffs . " I can get enough money from my father here in Chicago and I suppose I can get another warrant by wire , " Loftin told police . " But I ca n't ask you guys to trust me with a set of your cuffs and irons . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for him .
