East of Reno <P> Sirs : <P> Your statement TIME , Aug. 19 that Tony Stralla feels that Angelenos deserve the luxury of his floating gambling enterprise because there is n't a professional crap game west of Reno hardly makes sense . Los Angeles is east of Reno , as every high-school geography student knows . <P> EARLE A. CLEVELAND <P> Oakland , Calif . <P> To TIME 'S National Affairs Editor , herewith , a map of curvaceous California. - ED . <P> Twice Promised Land <P> Sirs : <P> In one paragraph of your very sympathetic article on " The Promised Land " in your Aug. 26 , 1946 issue , you state that " Jews , wherever they were , dreamed wistfully of a return to Palestine . " <P> Nothing could be further from the fact as it refers to Americans of the Jewish faith . <P> With few exceptions they-whether of the Reformed , Conservative or Orthodox way and even if they call themselves Zionists-think of Palestine as a place of refuge and a homeland for the D.P. s of Europe , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . . . <P> And there are , besides , that very considerable , but not so vocal , number who believe . . . that Zionism and the chauvinism that goes with it is not the answer . . . . <P> They . . . believe that in the U.S.A. they have a true and permanent homeland where , together with their Christian , Mohammedan , Buddhist and atheist fellow Americans they may live , worship and serve as free and equal citizens . They believe that until that condition is possible in every nation , the problem of D.P. s will not be solved . The problem " is only as hard as man 's heart . " <P> IRA W. HIRSHFIELD <P> Stamford , Conn . <P> Sirs : <P> May I commend you upon the thought-provoking cover of the Aug. 26 issue of TIME ? I would like also to thank the artist , R. M. Chapin Jr . . . . <P> The modernistic sketch of Jerusalem is so significant . No doubt the positions of the Star of David , the Cross and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to left , which is the way both Hebrew and Arabic read , they are chronologically correct . But what strikes me so forcibly , as a Christian , is that the Cross casts no shadow upon the City . " " ... I believe both the Crescent and the Star of David will always cast a shadow on Palestine , no matter who was there first or who is there now ! <P> EDNA VOORHEES DAWSON <P> Summit , N.J. <P> Blurt v. Blurb <P> Sirs : <P> Thank you for clearing the mystery of the missing Mr. Hollenbeck , sometime newscaster for WJZ TIME , Aug. 26 . If Radio should have a Man of the Year , he has one solid family vote on two counts : superior presentation of the news ; and the long-suppressed blurt against noxious commercials , which apparently cost him that job . <P> We would greatly appreciate hearing that he is back on the air . Can you tell us when and where ? <P> S. W. REED Washington , Conn . <P> He is still out of a job. - ED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
