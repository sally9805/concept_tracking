Besides making the trains run on time , Mussolini also made Rome 's turbulent traffic run smoothly . He prohibited the Roman pedestrian 's custom of reading newspapers in the middle of the street . Once , interrupted in his meditations by a horn insistently honking in the Piazza Venezia below , Mussolini shouted an order that all " acoustic signaling " be forthwith prohibited in Rome . Romans whispered sadly that their " city of noise " had become the citt del silenzio . <P> After Fascism 's fall , the horns honked again triumphantly . Jaywalking became an assertion of individual liberty . Then , last year , to show that freedom is not license , the police clamped down . <P> Roman cops , their topees set at a jaunty angle , intercepted all traffic offenders and on the spot collected sizable fines . To increase their civic zeal , the policemen were allowed to keep half of the fines . In vain the press cried out against this " unheard-of form of taxation .

( The gifts are brought by Befana , a green-shawled lady who travels on a broomstick and wears dark spectacles to protect her eyes when she dives down chimneys . ) Last week , Roman drivers halted their cars to hand over their presents to " off-duty " policemen who were especially stationed for this purpose next to the regular ones . <P> At every main intersection , the cops were knee-high in mounds of cheese , nuts , cake , fruit , beer , wine , liquors , and an occasional mug of shaving cream . One Roman police sergeant estimated that before Befana was done , each member of the 130-man traffic police force took home an average of four bottles of wine plus a pound of pasta . <P> Everybody hoped that such generosity would make Rome 's cops a little more lenient with individualism-either the jaywalking or the horn-blowing variety .                  @ @ @
