A showplace of Saratoga Springs , N. Y. is Yaddo , 500-acre estate of the late Banker Spencer Trask and his poet wife , Katrina . For twelve years Yaddo 's three-story stone , Victorian-Gothic mansion has been a free , luxurious refuge for writers , painters , musicians , critics , all carefully selected , and carefully mother-superiored by a high-minded , hieratic lady named , Elizabeth Ames . Yaddo has also been , on &; off during the past eight years , a place where serious U. S. composers could gather to play , hear , discuss their own music . As such it is valuable , for many composers , especially young ones , get little chance to hear how their work sounds . Last week Yaddo held its sixth long-haired jam session , officially called a Music Period . <P> From 150 scores submitted , a committee headed by Composer Richard Donovan chose works by 36 composers for performance in the Yaddo music room . Best-known name on the programs was Oklahoma-born Roy Harris ( TIME , April 8 ) , who provided a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quincy Porter 's eight-minute quintet for flute and strings , based on A-Tisket , A-Tasket , was the brightest bit . Ross Lee Finney gave out Bletheris , a monody for voice and orchestra based upon a section of The Hamlet of A. MacLeish , which was spoiled because Mr. Finney sang the vocal himself . And so on . None of the music would have set Saratoga Springs on fire , but it probably would have pleased Katrina Trask , who used to say : " At Yaddo they will find the Sacred Fire , and light their torches at its flame .
