The Smith Brothers are pillars of their community ; they run the finest gambling joint in Reno , Nev . Harold 's Club ( named for the older brother ) earns more than a million silver dollars every year , making it the nation 's biggest . The Smith boys are always ready to do something nice for people . They donated Reno 's Catholic nursery , gave $5,000 to pay off the mortgage of the local Methodist church , spent more thousands for the Mormons , the Church of the Nazarene , the Negro Methodists . Last week the Smith Brothers , who never got through high school , were ready to do something nice for education . <P> They offered the University of Nevada 27 four-year scholarships , each paying $1,000 a year . By the time the plan gets rolling , it will cost the Smiths $108,000 a year , and up to one-tenth of the student body will be going to school on gambling profits . Says Harold : " There are a lot of good minds hidden away in the little mining camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of them may do a lot for the state some day . You do n't know what college means unless you miss it yourself . " <P> In Reno , where gambling is legal , nobody raised an eyebrow when the university 's president accepted . Students with scruples about it can apply for one of the eight scholarships from the Reno Woman 's Christian Temperance Union instead . But the W.C.T.U. scholarships pay only $50.
