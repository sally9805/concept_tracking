Pietro Mascagni had one flash of genius . He was 26 , a penniless ex-conductor of a fourth-rate itinerant Italian opera company , when he heard of a prize contest for a new one-act opera . In eight feverish days and nights he wrote Cavalleria Rusticana , a fast-moving , lyric tale of love and murder in a Sicilian square at Eastertide . It won the prize , got its composer 40 curtain calls at its first performance in May 1890 , and subsequently the Order of the Crown of Italy . In Manhattan , Oscar Hammerstein produced Cavalleria in English , and the Metropolitan Opera did it in Italian ; both were hits . Critics hailed a new Verdi . <P> Stocky Pietro Mascagni tried 14 times to repeat his success . ( Shrewish Signora Mascagni , a peasant girl wrapped in furs on the profits of Cavalleria , jealously selected the casts of all 15 ) . But the audiences that cheered and wept over Cavalleria booed and hissed its pedantic successors . <P> Tribute &; Applause .

The obedient Fascist press hailed his 1935 opera Nero , a musical tribute to Mussolini 's Italy , but it flopped anyway . <P> U.S. audiences , continuing to applaud the 55-year-old Cavalleria ( which has had more than 250 performances at the Met ) , disregarded the composer 's Fascist foolishness . Many had even forgotten that he still lived , that he and Richard Strauss were the only living men among the composers in the Met 's 1944-45 season . <P> Last week , in a Rome hotel room , Cavalleria 's Mascagni , 81 , died . He had phrased his own epitaph after one of his failures : " It is a pity I did write Cavalleria first . I was crowned before I became King . "
