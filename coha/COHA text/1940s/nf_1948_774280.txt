txt  | Here , too , the demand may be estimated or metered and the hours of use chosen to suit the actual conditions best . It is more common to estimate the demand in the case of a Wright rate than in that of the Hopkinson rate . The customary form follows : 10 cents per kilowatthour for electricity used equivalent to , or less than , the first 30 hours ' use per month of the maximum demand . 5 cents per kilowatthour for additional electricity used equivalent to , or less than , the next 30 hours ' use per month of the maximum demand . 2 cents per kilowatthour for electricity used per month in excess of the equivalent of 60 hours ' use of the maximum demand . Assume a consumer with an estimated demand of 800 watts and a monthly consumption of 50 kwhr . His bill would then be figured as follows : figure To illustrate the effect of a large demand coupled with a small consumption , consider a customer whose demand is 2 kw and whose consumption is 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the maximum demand is 60 kwhr , and the bill would be figure This particular Wright rate is blocked . This is not essential , of course , but there are always two parts consisting of a statement covering hulls demand and energy portions of the monthly bill . The rate for the first part is usually 12 to 3 times the rate in the last part , for the first part . is designed to collect all the demand costs . 7 . Doherty Rates . As an example of a Doherty three-charge rate , consider the following : Demand charge : $3 per month per kilowatt for the first 25 kw of maximum demand in the month . $2 per month per kilowatt for the excess of the maximum demand over 25 kw  | Plus an energy charge of : 3 cents per kilowatthour for the first 1,000 kwhr used per month . 1 cent per kilowatthour for the excess over 1,000 kwhr used per month . Plus a customer charge of : 75 cents per month per meter . Assume a consumer with a demand of 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bill would be : figure It should be noted that , in the event that this customer did not use any electricity whatsoever , he would still receive a bill of 75 cents provided he still was connected to the distribution system of the public utility company . All these typical rate forms are subject , in actual practice , to numerous modifications . In some cases , this may be true to such an extent that the basic form is hardly recognized . Moreover , the figures chosen in these illustrations are not to be considered as universal but are used simply for demonstration purposes . They do represent , however , values frequently found in actual rate schedules . 8 . Rate-schedule Clauses . Any rate schedule of any form may have added to it one or more clauses giving discounts for improvement in load conditions , thus reducing the actual cost of service , or for the promotional purposes of improving station load or power factors . Some of the more common are listed below . a . Minimum Charge , Say $1 . This charge is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one important exception . I f , in any one month , the total bill exceeds the minimum charge , that charge is not added to the bill as is a customer charge . If the total bill is less than the minimum charge , the minimum charge determines the bill fund any energy cost less than the minimum charge is not included .  | b . Prompt-payment Discount , Say 10 Per Cent , 10 Days . This discount is usually figured on the total bill in excess of the minimum charge for payments made within 10 days . c . Coal Clause . A coal clause is sometimes employed to take care of fluctuations in the price or quality of coal . It is customarily applied only to the energy portion of the rate schedule and raises or lowers the unit rate according to whether the price of coal goes up or down . To be complete , such a clause should include the Btu content of the coal as well as its price . Such a coal clause might be worded as follows : " The energy charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1-cent increase above or decrease below 16.208 cents per million Btu when the average cost of fuel is more than 16.708 cents or less than 15.708 cents per million Btu . Such increase or decrease will be applied to the average portion of the kilowatthours delivered from steamgenerating sources . " More commonly the following form is used : " For all consumption in excess of 500,000 kwhr the energy charge is increased or decreased by 0.001 cent per kilowatthour for each 1-cent increase above $4.50 or decrease below $3.50 per short ton in cost of coal of 10,500 Btu per pound . " d . Power factor Clause . This clause operates customarily upon the demand portion of the rate schedule , either to raise or to lower the actual demand for billing purposes according to whether the power factor is below or above some predetermined average value , respectively . For example : " The measured demand for billing purposes shall be corrected to 85 per cent power factor by multiplying the measured demand by 85 and dividing the product by the measured power factor expressed in per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clauses and discounts less frequently used and usually of local or special application are the following : figure  | 2 . A variation that is sometimes used is 100 per cent of all appliances plus 80 per cent of the first 10 hp of motors , plus 50 per cent of the excess horsepower of motors . 3 . Some power companies prepare a table of appliances in which the demands of such apparatus are listed . 4 . Floor area of active rooms is sometimes used . 5 . Actual room count is a variation of item 4. 6 . Power per socket , such as 60 watts per socket , is another common method . In most cases where demand is estimated , the company reserves the right at its option actually to meter the demand . If the demand is to be metered , the block-interval or thermal demand meter may be used . Such a meter may be either of the indicating or the graphic type and for the block-interval type can be arranged to record the demand every 15 , 30 , or 60 minutes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time at which the maximum demand occurred is also obtained . When a rate schedule contains a power-factor clause , the power factor is usually determined by one of the following methods : To meter power factor , two meters are customarily required , one recording kilovarhours and the other actual kilowatthours of energy . From these two meters the weighted-average power factor may be calculated . If the power factor at the time of maximum demand is required , maximum-demand indicators must be furnished with each meter or graphic attachments must be supplied . In either event , such an installation is expensive . The measurement of the kilovolt-ampere demand is even less common and requires a still more expensive metering installation . It should be emphasized again that the figures expressed in this chapter are not to be considered as standard or necessarily correct for any particular locality but are used merely as illustrations . Rates may justly vary widely in different localities , and no standard rate is possible of expression . Each case must be made an object of special local study in order to determine a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle Western utility has the following general service rate in force : Bate .

There was a time when the engineer could leave to the legal department any question involving the legality of his transactions , just as it was once possible for him to leave all matters of finance to the businessman . However , engineering as it is practiced today requires the engineer at least to avoid legal entanglements detrimental to himself or his company and to be able to converse intelligently with his legal advisers . For example , both the beginning and end of any undertaking by an engineer invariably involve a contract with a second party . This contract may be for the engineer 's personal services or for the product of his company . It is important that he sign good contracts and not bad ones . The latter may result in financial loss to himself or bankruptcy for his company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to point out at least a portion of the law relating to commerce and business so that the engineer may avoid some of the mistakes that many of his predecessors have made . It should be borne in mind , in studying the subject of law as here presented , that this is not a finished treatise on the subject , but rather an explanation of the fundamental concepts of law concerning those things with which the engineer is likely to come in almost daily contact . It , is more the object of this study to point out the need of competent legal advice in matters of law than to teach the engineer to be his own lawyer . I61  | LAW AND THE COURTS 1 . Law in General . A law in its broadest sense is a rule of action . ' It includes ( 1 ) that body of rules and principles , known as natural laws , on which the sciences are based and ( 2 ) that body of rules and principles which governs men in their relations with one another and with society as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the engineer and forms the foundation of his training . The second group , sometimes called human laws , may be classified further as moral law , international law , and national , state , or municipal law . a . Moral Law . Moral law belongs to the science of ethics and is considered in Chap . 27. b . International Law . International law is that body of rules of civil conduct which by the common consent of civilized nations has been adopted to regulate their conduct with one another . It includes also those regulations covering the rights and duties of citizens when in foreign countries . c . National , State , or Municipal Law . National , state , or municipal law is that body of rules prescribed by competent political authority which , when applied to the governing of a nation , state , or municipality , either commands what is right or prohibits what is wrong.2 It is this body of laws in which we are principally interested and which is often called the positive law . Positive law is divided into written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equity and admiralty jurisprudence. d . Written Law . The written law consists of ( 1 ) the Constitution of the United States , ( 2 ) the constitutions of the several states , ( 3 ) the treaties of the United States , ( 4 ) the acts of Congress , ( 5 ) the statutes of the several states , and ( 6 ) the local charters and ordinances of smaller political subdivisions. e . Unwritten Law . The unwritten law in this country is of double inception . It consists first of that body of rules which has been establiti7red by the decisions of the courts of last resort , a court of last resort being the highest court to which a given controversy may ordinarily be carried . Second , it consists of those parts of the old English common law as adopted by the several states which were in existence prior to the American Ite ' olution and which were not peculiar to England or inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States or that of the state in 161  | question . Thus the unwritten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people of a particular state . Because of the common-law origin of part of the unwritten law , all unwritten law is sometimes called common law . This term , however , is confusing , for it is also used to designate the basis of jurisprudence in England and the United States , with the exception of Louisiana , in contradistinction to civil law , which is the basis of jurisprudence in the remainder of the civilized countries of the Western Hemisphere . It is also a term applied to courts whose jurisprudence is based upon the written and unwritten law , in distinction to courts of equity . Almost daily the higher courts are rendering new decisions involving new or old controversies . Their decisions are then used as precedents for future decisions of the lower courts . Thus the major portion of the unwritten law is made up of the reports of decided cases that extend back to about the thirteenth century . As an example , consider the following contract , which , although a very poor contract , nevertheless will illustrate the process by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suppose that a certain power company enters into a contract with a meter manufacturer to ship the said power company about 100 meters per month for a year . In January the manufacturer ships 70 meters ; in February , 80 meters ; in March , 90 meters . Thereafter , the power company refuses to accept any more meters , giving as its reason that the manufacturer has breached his contract in that he has not sent " about " 100 meters a month . It is obvious that the decision in this case would hinge on the interpretation given to the word " about . " If the parties were unable to reach a decision themselves , they would submit the case in due form to a common-law court . If this court had no precedent to follow , i.e. , if there were no decision of a court of last resort bearing on this or a similar question , it would hear the evidence , examine the facts , and listen to the arguments of both parties . Then this court would reach a conclusion and hand down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were dissatisfied with the decision the court had made and were able , by proper procedure , to submit their case to a higher tribunal , from which it was finally appealed to the court of last resort in the state . This court would either affirm or disaffirm the decision of the lower courts and in so doing would definitely establish the ruling on the word " about . " This ruling , since it is a decision of a court of last resort , then becomes a part of the unwritten law in that jurisdiction . 2 . Civil and Criminal Law . The term " civil law " originally designated ' the Roman jurisprudence ( system of laws ) , which is the basis of continental European jurisprudence . Such jurisprudence was brought to Louisiana by the French settlers and forms the basis of the jurisprudence in that , state today . However , in the remaining states , civil law is used to designate  | the private rights , wrongs , and remedies of individuals in contrast to criminal law , which deals with the wrongs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore punishes in its own name . As an example of this civil law , suppose that Smith enters into a contract with Brown to dig the foundation for a garage . Later , but before the foundation is finished , Smith repudiates his contract . Brown now has the right , if he chooses to exercise it , of suing Smith for breach of contract since Smith , by repudiating his contract , has infringed a personal or individual right of Brown 's . Society as a whole is not interested in the case , and if the government were to prosecute Smith , it would be a needless interference with personal liberty . It should be noticed that an infringement of an individual or personal right or a wrong against an individual will go unpunished unless the offended person chooses to bring action . But suppose that Smith enters Brown 's house and steals Brown 's watch . Smith in this case has committed a wrong against an individual just as in the first case . But this wrong is also a menace to society as a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its own name , by a process known as criminal proceedings , undertake to punish Smith . Those wrongs done to an individual by another , which society at large recognizes as injurious to it and for which definite punishment has been affixed , are called crimes . Society in its own name will take up the cause of the injured party and prosecute the criminal to prevent similar conduct on the part of other members of the community . 3 . Torts . Those wrongs done to an individual , which society considers personal to the individual , other than a breach of contract , and which are punishable only upon the instigation of the one injured , are called , in general , torts . Technically , a tort is any wrong , not arising out of a breach of contract , for which a private action for damages may be maintained . ' It should be noted particularly that a breach of contract is not a tort , for there are some classes of individuals who can not be held for their contracts but who can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is sixteen years of age , contracts to mow Brown 's lawn . This he neglects to do . Brown can not sue Smith for breach of contract , for Smith is under legal age . If , however , Smith throws a stone through Brown 's window , he can be sued for tort . Torts , like crimes , are infringements of absolute or relative rights of other members of the community . The absolute rights are the rights of ( I ) personal security , ( 2 ) personal liberty , and ( 3 ) private property . The relative rights are ( 1 ) public and ( 2 ) private . Typical examples of torts that infringe these rights are , respectively , assault and battery , false imp isonment , , trespass , violation of official duty , and abduction of a member ( If the household by a third person .  | As implied in the above definition , the appropriate remedy for a tort is a civil action for damages brought by the injured party . However , settlement might be effected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of court . Finally the right of action arising out of a tort may not persist indefinitely . In some instances death of either party may act to discharge it , or the statute of limitations may function to outlaw it . It should be borne in mind that failure to do the right thing is often as serious as actually doing the wrong thing . Also , doing something that in itself is not wrong but that causes another to suffer may result in a cause for action . The law takes this into account by making an individual liable for tort through ( 1 ) actually performing a wrong act that results in an injury to another , such as destroying another 's property ; ( 2 ) doing something which in itself is not illegal but which is done in such a manner , at such a time , or in such a place that it causes damage to another , for example , keeping livestock which , through negligence , is allowed to escape to another 's land , where it does damage ; ( 3 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one should do , thus causing another to suffer loss , such as failure to place appropriate signs or guards about exposed machines or dangerous voltages . Technically these acts are called , respectively , malfeasance , misfeasance , and nonfeasance. 4 . Equity Jurisprudence . This extraordinary system of jurisprudence had its inception in the High Court of Chancery in England . The reader who would gain a clear understanding of the difference between equity and common law should read the history of this court , for time and space are not available here to do more than discuss equity in its modern sense . This system of jurisprudence came into existence and grew largely because of the rigidity of the common law and the inability of the common-law courts to grant adequate relief . As we have seen , common law can compensate the individual for the infringement of his legal right , but it can not prevent such infringement . The only remedy the common law offers for a breach of contract is money damages , although often actual performance is the only just compensation possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can compensate an individual for injuries done to him , it can not prevent those injuries , even if they may be known in advance . It would seem that equity as originally conceived was an ideal system , but it has gradually become more and more rigid until , as it is practiced today , courts of equity are very hesitant to invent new remedies . There are , however , certain very definite equitable rights , remedies , and titles that equity courts will recognize . Examples : 1 . A certain power company illegally entered Brown 's land and started to erect a transmission line . Now Brown did not earn to have a transmission line on  | his property . In this case , Brown might immediately secure an injunction from a court of equity , restraining the power company from erecting the transmission line . 2 . Smith gave Black , his legal agent , a certified check and instructed Black to buy for him a certain lot . The agent was carefully instructed by Smith to make the deed out to Smith . Black , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At common law Smith would have no title to the property , but a court of equity could force Black to deed the property to Smith . 5 . Admiralty Jurisprudence . Admiralty jurisprudence is a system of law entirely separate from either common law or equity and in this country is administered exclusively by the Federal courts . It deals with maritime contracts , torts , injuries , or offenses4 and has in its jurisdiction the navigable rivers of the United States , whether tidal or not , the lakes and the waters included in them . Example : Smith , a passenger on a United States steamer , is accused of inciting a mutiny . 6 . Commercial Law . Commercial law or business law is not a separate branch of law but that part of civil law which is applied to persons engaged in commerce or business . The principles and rules that it embraces have been elaborately developed because of the highly organized industrial and commercial conditions of the present age , and it has been worked out in great detail . 7 . The Courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as defining the rights and limitations of individuals in their relations with one another . These rights are of little avail if there is not provided a means of enforcing them . The Constitution of the United States provides such means by establishing a system of courts . These courts can not try all cases indiscriminately but have certain fixed jurisdiction , which must cover both the subject matter and the person . Thus a court in one county of a state would not ordinarily have jurisdiction over a question of the title of land in another county ; nor will a court in Indiana ordinarily have jurisdiction over a resident of Michigan . Courts may be classified as : Courts of original jurisdiction . Courts of appellate jurisdiction . Courts of both original and appellate jurisdiction . Civil courts . Criminal courts . Courts of equity . Courts of general jurisdiction . ( Courts of limited or special jurisdiction .  | a . Courts of Original Jurisdiction . Courts of original jurisdiction are those courts which have the power to hear cases when they first arise . b . Courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authority to try a case , not when it first arises , but only when the case is referred to it . It reviews the cases of the lower courts . The taking of a case from a lower to higher court is called an appeal . c . Courts of Both Original and Appellate Jurisdiction . These courts have original jurisdiction in some cases and appellate jurisdiction in others . d . Civil and Criminal Courts . Courts are also either civil or criminal . The former try cases involving disputes between individuals , and the latter are courts that hear and determine criminal cases . Moreover , civil courts may be either common-law courts or courts of equity . Formerly equity courts were separate and distinct , with separate judges , but frequently in present practice the same court sits both as a common-law court and as a court of equity , with the same judge presiding . It will act during one term as a court of common law and during another term as a court of equity . e . Courts of General and Special Jurisdiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have jurisdiction to try the cases before them , but in courts of special jurisdiction it is necessary to prove in the pleadings that they have the jurisdiction . 8 . Federal Courts . Besides the courts previously described , there are also the Federal , or United States , courts . These courts have the power to try cases arising under the laws , treaties , and Constitution of the United States . Their jurisdiction includes all cases affecting ambassadors , public ministers , and consuls . As has been previously mentioned , they administer all cases arising under admiralty law and also interstate cases where the damages are $2,000 or more . The Federal courts are organized into the Supreme Court , District Courts , Circuit Courts of Appeals , and others . a . The United States Supreme Court . This is the highest court in the land and has both original and appellate jurisdiction . The court is composed of a chief justice and eight associate justices . It has original jurisdiction over proceedings extending against ambassadors and public ministers and their families , and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the parties . It has appellate jurisdiction over cases arising from the circuit or district Federal courts . b . Circuit Court of Appeals . This is an intermediate court established , for the purpose of relieving the Supreme Court . The United States is divided into nine circuits , and one Supreme Court justice is assigned to each of these circuits . The circuit court reviews the cases appealed or transferred to it ; or by writ of error from the district Federal court .  | c . District Courts . This is the commonest of all the Federal courts . Each state has at least one district court , and some have as many as four . Each district is presided over by one district judge . District courts have original jurisdiction of all civil suits which involve laws or treaties of the United States , or suits between citizens of different states , or a suit between a United States citizen and a foreign citizen . They also have jurisdiction of crimes and offenses coming under the authority of the United States , civil cases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patent , trade-mark and copyright laws , bankruptcy , and many other laws . d . Other Federal Courts . Congress has established a Court of Claims to hear claims against the Federal government , a Court of Custom Appeals to hear cases arising under revenue laws dealing with imports , and Consular Courts dealing with complaints of United States citizens against foreign countries . 9 . State Courts . The judicial system of a state may consist of the supreme , appellate , criminal , superior , circuit , juvenile , and probate courts ; the justices of the peace ; the grand and petit juries ; the prosecuting attorneys ; jury commissioners ; probation officers ; and various other auxiliary officers . a . Supreme Court . The supreme court is created by the constitution of the state . The supreme court has jurisdiction throughout the state in appeals and writs of error from the lower courts and such original jurisdiction as the state assembly may confer . Some of the most important questions appealed to the supreme court are : 1 . Rights guaranteed by the state or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . Criminal prosecutions . 4 . Election contests. 5 . Contests of wills . 6 . Drains and watercourse controversies . 7 . Appropriation of lands for public use . 8 . Public highways . 9 . Contempt of lower courts . 10 . Admission and disbarment of attorneys. 11 . Other cases involving $6,000 or more . b . Appellate Court . The appellate court is usually established by an act of the legislature to relieve the supreme court . Its jurisdiction covers all appealed cases from the lower courts of the state that do not go direct to the supreme court . If the appellate court is overcrowded , the supreme court ; may elect to take part of the business . c . Superior Courts . The superior courts are usually created by an act of the ' ( ; eneral Assembly to relieve the circuit courts . The jurisdiction  | of the superior courts varies , but in general they have original concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit courts in all civil cases . Some superior courts sit as a court of claims for cases brought against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts are created by the constitution of the state . There is usually one in each county . The circuit courts have original exclusive jurisdiction in all cases at law or equity including criminal cases , action for divorce , and settlements of estates and guardianship and such matters as defined by the General Assembly . e . Criminal Courts . The criminal courts usually are established by an act of the General Assembly to relieve the circuit courts in heavily populated districts . These courts have original exclusive jurisdiction of all crimes and misdemeanors , except where jurisdiction is by law conferred on the justice of the peace and except for such appellate jurisdiction in criminal cases as belongs to circuit courts in counties not having a criminal court . f . Probate Courts . A probate court has original exclusive jurisdiction in all matters pertaining to the probation of wills ; administration and settlement of the estates of minors , insane persons , the aged , the impotent , habitual drankards , and insolvents ; the appointment of guardians , administrators , and trustees ; and other like matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all cases relating to the custody and legal punishment of children , juvenile delinquents , and truants. h . Justice of the Peace Court . The justice of the peace is a constitutional officer elected by the voters . He has jurisdiction over all cases founded on contracts or torts , when the debts or damages do not exceed approximately $100 in value , and concurrent jurisdiction in all suits when the amount does not exceed $200. 10 . Court Personnel and Procedures . a . Pleadings and Practice . Besides the law and the courts , there is an extensive system of rules and regulations governing the procedure that one must follow in seeking aid in a court . These rules are grouped under the head of pleadings and practice . They are essential in order that the courts may conduct their business in an orderly manner . Space is not available to pursue the subject of pleadings and practice further than to say that it concerns the process by which a case is brought to trial , is tried , and is appealed if necessary . b . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 23 reputable citizens of the county . It is convened at least once a year . It is the duty of the , grand jury to investigate alleged violations of the criminal laws , the management of prisons and poorhouses , and the corrupt conduct of public officers . The indictments found are called true bills and must he concurred in by a majority of the jurors.  | c . Petit Jury . This is the regular court jury impounded to try cases in any court where a jury trial is required . It consists of 12 citizens chosen from a larger group selected by the jury commissioners .

List the subjects usually included in commercial law .  | CONTRACTS OF COMMERCE The foregoing discussion of law and the courts will afford the necessary background for a more detailed study of certain parts of commercial law of vital interest to engineers . These parts include ( 1 ) the law of contracts , ( 2 ) the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments , and ( 4 ) the law of sales . These subdivisions of commercial law will be considered in subsequent chapters . It was early evident that commercial enterprises would require something more than the ethical integrity of individuals to bind their promises , one with another . As the magnitude and intricacy of commerce increased , there gradually developed the law on contracts . Such law represents an attempt on the part of the state to create an actual insurance of good faith among men in their dealings . It has truthfully been said that the contract , a legally enforceable promise , is the foundation stone of modern society . Certainly we can not conceive of commerce as it exists today without the contract or its equivalent . Yet it must be borne in mind that , like all law , the law on contracts is no more perfect than the people themselves who made it . 1 . Definition of a Contract . A contract is an agreement enforceable at law between two or more competent parties for a legal consideration or in writing under seal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Essentials of a Valid Contract . There are many elements necessary to make a legal and binding contract , but the following six are fundamental ; it is , therefore , desirable that the reader become thoroughly familiar with them . 1 . There must be two or more competent parties . 2 . There must be an agreement , viz. , an actual offer and definite acceptance . 3 . There must be a genuine agreement or meeting of the minds . 4 . There must be a proper consideration to support the contract . 5 . The subject matter of the contract must be lawful . 6 . The contract must be in writing when so required by the Statute of Frauds. 3 . Classification of Contracts . While there are many different classifications of contracts that might he given , the following will he found sufficient for the purpose of this study of the subject .  | a . Executory and Executed Contracts . 1 . An executory contract is one in which the thing or things agreed upon have not been done . Example : Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Brown , a manufacturer , upon Brown 's promise to pay Smith $500 therefor . 2 . An executed contract is one in which the thing or things agreed upon have been done . Example : Smith completed the design of the switchboard and actually received $500 therefor . 3 . It is obvious that a contract may be executory on the one side and executed on the other . Example : Smith completed the design of the switchboard , but Brown has not yet paid Smith the $500 therefor . b . Express and Implied Contracts . 1 . An express contract is one in which all the terms of the contract have been assented to either orally or in writing ; nothing has been left to be inferred . Example : Smith said to Brown , a carpenter , " I will hire you for one week for $75 . " Brown answered , " I will work for you at that price . " 2 . An implied contract is one in which the terms are to be gathered by implication or deduced from the general language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Implied contracts are of two kinds , those implied as of fact and those created by law . c . A Quasi Contract . An implied contract created by law is called a quasi contract . A complete definition is beyond the scope of this text ; it involves a miscellaneous group of obligations for which the modern remedy is the action of assumpsit , one meaning of which is to force payment of an equitable obligation in lieu of damages as in the following example . Example : Smith , a consulting engineer , receives a telephone call from a party who he believes is Brown , when in fact it is Allen , asking Smith to specify a certain interior lighting scheme for his factory . Smith goes to Brown 's factory , collects the necessary data , and makes the design ? all unknown to Brown . He later sends the specification and plans to Brown . As it happens , Brown was also contemplating a change in his lighting and uses Smith 's specifications . Here Smith may collect the reasonable price for the design from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Brown whatever . The law will imply a contract if Brown accepts the benefits . d . Specialty and Simple Contracts . 1 . A specialty contract is a written express contract under seal or scroll , which is affixed to the names of the parties to the contract . It is a formal contract such as a deed or bond . 2 . A simple contract is an express contract without a seal . It may be written or oral and is often called a parol contract . This use of the term " parol " is misleading , for by definition " parol " means " oral . ' ' When used lrreafter , the word " parol " will refer to an oral contract only .  | e . Joint , Several , and Joint and Several Contracts . 1 . A joint contract is one in which the parties promising are jointly bound or in which the parties to whom the promise is made are jointly entitled to the thing promised . Example : Smith and Brown sign the following note : " One year after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value received , one thousand dollars ( $1,000.00 ) with interest at six per cent ( 6% ) per annum . " In this contract Smith and Brown are jointly liable for the payment of the money , and Allen and Baker are jointly entitled to have the money paid to them . 2 . A several contract is one in which each party promising is individually liable , or in which each party to whom the promise is made is individually entitled to performance . Example : Smith and Brown sign the following note : " One year after date , for value received , I promise to pay Allen and Baker , to be divided equally between them , one thousand dollars ( $1,000.00 ) with interest at six per cent ( 6% ) per annum . " In this contract Smith and Brown are each individually liable to Allen and Baker for the payment of the money , and both Allen and Baker are individually entitled to performance . 3 . A joint and several contract is one in which the parties to whom the promise is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or severally , bound to perform the obligation . Example : Smith and Brown sign the following note : " One year after date , for value received , we , and each of us , promise to pay to Allen one thousand dollars ( $1,000.00 ) with interest at six per cent ( 6% ) per annum . " In this contract Allen is entitled to collect the full amount of the note with interest from either Smith or Brown or Smith and Brown jointly . In other words , Smith and Brown are individually , or jointly , liable for the full amount . f . Valid , Voidable , Void , and Unenforceable Contracts . 1 . A voidable contract is one which may be set aside by the party promising , at his option , or which may be confirmed by him . Example : As we shall see later , the contracts of a minor ( a person not of legal age ) are , in general , voidable . That is , a minor may affirm or disaffirm his voidable contracts at his option . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal obligation . Example : A contract to do some unlawful act , such as compound a crime , is void . 3 . An unenforceable contract is one in which the thing promised , although legal , is impossible of performance . Example : A contract to erect an addition to a house that burns previous to act ion , under the contract is unenforceable. 4 . A valid contract is any contract , not included in the above classification , in which both parties are bound and which may be enforced by law .  | REVIEW QUESTIONS 1 . Discuss the importance of the contract to modern society . Was it always as important as it is today ? Why ? 2 . Classify the following contracts in as many ways as possible : ( a ) X , who is 18 years of age , agrees with Y , an adult , to exchange a radio for a set of books .

If a seal is affixed to a contract , what effect does it have ? 10 . May a contract be both executory and executed ?  | COMPETENT PARTIES 1 . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract is an agreement between two or more parties and that these parties must be competent in the eyes of the law to enter into a legal agreement . Thus , a man can not contract with himself . A trustee or agent , while in that capacity , can not enter into a legal contract with himself as an individual . Thus in White v. Ward ( 26 Ark. 445 ) * it was held that an agent or trustee could not , in his own name , purchase property of which he controls the sale . 2 . Parties Must Be Legally Competent . It may be said in general that all but the following are competent to enter into contracts . The right of the following parties to contract is conditional upon certain requirements that will now be considered . 1 . Infants . 2 . Insane persons . 3 . Habitual drunkards. 4 . Married women , in some states . 5 . Corporations . 6 . Foreigners . 3 . Contracts by Infants or Minors . " An infant ( or minor ) is a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common law or by statute as the time when a person is presumed to have reached full maturity . " ' The exact age at which this occurs is , of course , different in different persons , but the common law has decreed that minors , both male and female , reach their majority one day before their twenty-first birthday . In the case of females , some states have modified the common law so that a woman comes of age at eighteen . In a few states all minors are deemed of age on becoming married ; in others , the woman comes of age on being married , if the man is twenty-one . a . Infants ' Contracts Voidable . In general , all infants ' contracts are voidable at law ; i.e. , they may be repudiated or disaffirmed by the infant ; * The cases cited in this book arose in the states indicated in the titles . Thus the case of White v. Ward ( 26 Ark. 445 ) , given above , arose in the state of Arkansas and will be found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , state on p. 445 . White was the plaintiff in this case and Ward the defendant . 174  | and any consideration he may have paid may be demanded for reimbursement . There are , however , a few exceptions and conditions to this general rule . b . Infants ' Executory Contracts . All wholly executory contracts of a minor are voidable , before or after coming of age . If , however , the minor desires to disaffirm an executory contract , he must do so within a reasonable length of time . c . Infants ' Executed Contracts . All fully executed contracts of a minor are also voidable except the following : 1 . Contracts of marriage . This does not mean contracts to marry , which are voidable. 2 . Contracts for enlistment in the Army or Navy . This means actual enlistment and not a contract to enlist . 3 . Contracts for necessaries. d . Infants ' Contracts Executed by the Adult but Executory by the Infant . These contracts are also voidable except for necessaries. e . Who May Ratify or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , his legal representative after his death , or those entitled to his estate can disaffirm his avoidable contract . If an infant makes a contract with an adult , the infant alone has the right to disaffirm ; the adult can not repudiate it . The privilege of ratification or disaffirmance is thus personal to the infant , and neither his guardian during his minority nor his creditors after he has come of age can disaffirm . For example , in Kendall v. Lawrence ( 22 Mass. 540 ) an infant deeded certain land to another . After reaching his majority , he neither ratified nor disaffirmed the deed . His creditors , after he had come of age , attempted to set aside the sale or take the land on attachment . It was held that the deed was valid as to third parties . A minor 's deed is voidable , and the right to void it is personal with the minor . f . Method of Affirmance and Disaffirmance . As previously stated , the rule governing affirmance and disaffirmance varies in the application to executed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be by some distinct or positive act that leaves no doubt of the intent or by such acts and conduct that agreement to be bound will be implied . However , disaffirmance of an executed contract must be by some positive act or statement . Silence for a reasonable time after a minor comes of age , especially if it is coupled with a retention of the benefits , will in most cases be construed as an affirmance . The following case gives a ruling on the duration of a reasonable time : In Scranton v. Steward ( 52 Ind . 68 ) there was an action to recover real estate deeded by a minor . Three and a half years after reaching her majority , plaintiff , the minor , disaffirmed the deed by written notice to  | defendant . It will be seen that this case hinges on the interpretation of what is a " reasonable time . " The court held that 31- years was a reasonable time . However , the evidence in the case showed that authorities differ in their opinion as to what is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ranges from 1 to 20 years , according to the peculiar circumstances of each case and the views of the different judges . In most cases an infant can disaffirm any of his voidable contracts before , as well as after , coming of age , except in the conveyance of realty . He must wait until he reaches his majority before he can set aside a conveyance of realty . Examples : 1 . In Childs v. Dobbins ( 55 Iowa 205 ) plaintiff , a minor , entered into a contract with defendant to purchase some trees and shrubbery ( not considered real estate ) for which he paid $500 . A few days thereafter , and while still a minor , he tendered back the trees and shrubbery and demanded the $500 . It was held that an infant can disaffirm a contract at any time during minority or within a reasonable time thereafter . 2 . However , in Welch v. Bunce ( 83 Ind . 382 ) , which was an action to set aside a conveyance of land by plaintiff while yet a minor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be settled by the decisions of this court that an infant can not disaffirm or avoid his conveyance of real estate , simply on the ground of infancy , which is the only ground relied upon in this case at hand , until his or her arrival at majority . " The rule has been well established that a minor can not affirm a part of a contract and disaffirm the balance . Also , after reaching his majority and ratifying a contract , he can not later disaffirm it ; conversely , having disaffirmed a contract , he can not later ratify it . He could , of course , enter into a new contract . Example : In Heath v. West ( 28 N.H. 101 ) plaintiff purchased a house from defendant , paying $7,500 in cash and giving a mortgage on the house for the balance . He refused to pay the mortgage , and when the house was sold to satisfy the same , he brought suit to recover the house . It was held that this was one transaction ; he could not repudiate the mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an infant must return the benefits , if it is in his power to do so , but his right to rescind a contract supersedes his ability to return the benefits , if it is impossible for him to do it . Example : In Green v. Green ( 69 N.Y . 553 ) defendant , a minor , sold certain land to his father for $400 . After " coming of age , he reentered upon the land and rescinded his contract but made no offer to return any part of the $400 . It was shown that he had lost , spent , or squandered all the $400 . It was held that he had the right to disaffirm the contract without returning the consideration . g . Infants ' Contracts for Necessaries . An infant is absolutely bound by his contracts for necessaries . The question as to what are necessaries is often in dispute , but in general it can be said that necessaries include any goods or services needed by an infant for his reasonable comfort , sub-  | sistence , shelter , or education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these things . However , in Kline v. L'Amoreaux ( 2 Paige 419 ) * it was held that a minor can not make a binding contract for anything whatsoever if he is under the care of a parent or guardian who has the means and who is willing to furnish him all his actual necessaries . In judging what are necessaries , the court will take into consideration the infant 's station in society , his wealth , position , health , and kindred subjects . Although an infant is bound to pay for his necessaries for himself and wife , he need pay only a reasonable price for the same , and the burden of proof as to whether a minor already has a sufficient supply of such necessaries is upon the vendor . The object of this rule is obvious . If an infant could not be held for the necessities of life , he might at times undergo much suffering and hardship for want of such necessaries . Examples : 1 . Hym.on v. Cain ( 48 N.C. 111 ) was an action to recover board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with plaintiff for about two years . The court held that an infant must pay a reasonable price for necessaries furnished him . 2 . In Strong v. Foote ( 42 Conn. 203 ) the defendant , a minor and wealthy , had his teeth filled by the plaintiff , a dentist . The bill amounted to nearly $100 . It was proved that the teeth were in bad shape and pained defendant . It was held that the work was for necessaries and plaintiff could recover . 3 . In Barnes v. 1'oge 13 Q.B.D. ( Eng. ) 410 defendant , an infant , purchased some goods which were necessaries but of which he already had a sufficient supply . In an action to recover the price of these goods , the court held that the goods were not necessaries , as the defendant was already provided with a sufficient supply , and that it was immaterial whether or not the plaintiff knew of this supply . 4 . Contracts by Insane Persons . One of the essentials to a valid contract is a genuine agreement , or the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no meeting of the minds if one of the persons to the contract is insane . The difficulty is that many insane persons are insane only at intervals or upon certain subjects ; at other times they appear rational , so that one might deal with an insane person and be ignorant of his insanity . The law , as far as contracts are concerned , is not interested in the general sanity of a person but in his sanity on the particular subject matter of the contract in question . The law recognizes two classes of insane persons , ( 1 ) insane persons who have been declared legally insane by a court having proper jurisdiction and for whom guardians have been appointed by the court and ( 2 ) insane persons who have not legally been adjudged insane . a . Contract of Insane Persons Legally Declared Insane . The contracts of insane persons who have been legally declared insane by a court of * Where a name of a person is used in place of that of a state , it refers to the official court reporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed are absolutely void except for necessaries . As an example , consider the case of Gerner v. Rannels ( 80 Mo . 474 ) , in which a person who had been legally declared insane deeded certain lands , for which he received the proper compensation . After the insane person 's death , his wife sued for her share of her husband 's estate . The court held that the deed of an insane person who has been placed under guardianship is absolutely void . b . Contracts of Insane Persons Not Legally Declared Insane . 1 . Wholly executory contracts of insane persons will not be enforced by a court , even if the party dealing with the insane person did not know of the insanity . 2 . Fully executed contracts of an insane person will not be set aside provided that the contract was fair , no advantage was taken of the insane person , and the party dealing with him was ignorant of the insanity , unless both parties can be put in statu quo , viz. , placed back in the same condition in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties can be put in statu quo , the majority of the courts will make every effort to set the contract aside . 3 . If the party dealing with the insane person is ignorant of his insanity and has executed his part of the contract , the court will not allow the insane person to disaffirm it unless he returns the benefits . 4 . If the party contracting with the insane person knew of his insanity or with reasonable diligence could have ascertained that he was insane , whether dealing fairly and honestly or not , the insane person can disaffirm the contract and demand the consideration , whether or not the insane person can return any benefits he may have received . 5 . An insane person can be held for necessaries , just as may be done in the case of a minor . Examples : 1 . In Gribbon v. Maxwell ( 34 Ilan. 8 ) the plaintiff , a lunatic , made a conveyance of real property to the defendant . The defendant was totally ignorant , of the plaintiff 's insanity , in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair price for the property . It was held that , whereas the conveyance was made in good faith prior to a legal declaration of insanity and for a fair and reasonable price , and since no advantage was taken of the insane person and no offer was made to return the consideration , the contract was valid . 2 . Creekmore v. Baxter ( 121 N.C. 31 ) was an action to set aside the conveyance of real estate by a lunatic . It was shown that defendant knew of the insanity at the time when the deed was made . It was held that the land could be recovered . 3 . Sawyer v. Lufkin ( 56 Me. 308 ) was an action to recover for the services of caring for defendant , who was a lunatic incapable of caring for himself . Held that the plaintiff could recover , as the services were necessaries. 5 . Contracts by Persons When Drunk . Drunkenness at law is handled in a similar manner to insanity . The law recognizes two classes of drunkards , ( 1 ) those who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have not , been legally declared habitual tlrttnkar ( ( ls.  | a . Legally Declared Habitual Drunkards . The contracts of legally declared habitual drunkards are , at law , the same as those of persons who have been legally declared insane . b . Drunkards Not Legally Declared Habitual Drunkards . If the person is intoxicated to the extent that , for the time being , he is incompetent to comprehend the consequences of his acts , he may afterward affirm or disaffirm any contract entered into while thus intoxicated . Example : In Cummings v. Henry ( 10 Ind . 109 ) plaintiff , while drunk , gave his note for the purchase price of an automobile . After becoming sober , he tendered back the automobile and demanded his note . The court held that the party might rescind if he was so intoxicated as to be incompetent to contract . 6 . Contracts by Married Women . Under the old common law a woman , on becoming married , lost her legal identity . She could not sue or be sued upon a contract in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1893 , however , statute has completely changed the status of a married woman in the eyes of the law . In most states she can carry on business in her own name , sue and be sued , and even , in some cases , contract with her own husband as if she were a stranger . In fact , her capacity to contract is the rule and her incapacity the exception . Some states forbid the wife to sell or mortgage real estate without the joinder of her husband , and in others she can not become surety for her husband . 7 . Contracts by Corporations . A corporation is an artificial person created by due process of law . This process must comply with the laws of the state in which the corporation is formed . It is limited in its power to enter into contracts by its articles of incorporation , its bylaws , and the laws of the state or country that regulate corporations . Not only must any contract that it makes be within the scope of its legally created or implied powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an actual person or persons legally designated to enter into such a contract for the corporation . When a corporation does enter into a contract or performs a transaction which is not included within its expressed or implied powers , it is said to have committed an ultra vires act . Such contracts are referred to as ultra wires contracts . The effect of ultra vires contracts depends on whether that act is completely executed , partially executed , or executory . Wholly executed ultra vires contracts will not ordinarily be set aside . All wholly executory ultra vires contracts will generally not be enforced on the grounds that a corporation should not receive court aid to do something it should not do . In case of partly executed ultra vires contracts the court in general will enforce the unexecuted part if it is obviously equitable to do so . For example , if a corporation authorized to make  | and sell commodity A but not commodity B does make and sell to C a number of units of commodity B , C would have to pay for the units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general , foreigners residing in the United States have full contractual powers except in time of war . In some states foreigners are limited in their right to buy , hold , or sell real estate . SPECIFIC REFERENCE 1 . " Cyclopedia of Law and Procedure , " Par . 511 .

In consideration for having a member of the family a college graduate , X gave his 19-year old nephew John $1,000 with which to finish his last year at college . John agreed to finish and did complete one of the two semesters of work , but instead of continuing he took what was left of the money and went abroad . On his return 6 months later , his uncle sued . John set up the defense that he was a minor and could repudiate the agreement even if he could not return any of the money . Was the defense good ? Why ? 2 . X , a minor , deeded real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X disaffirmed the deed by written notice to Y. Discuss the ruling in this case . Would you change your ruling if X had made his disaffirmance 6 months before coming of age ? Why ? 3 . X , a minor , boarded with Y while in college . X had not paid his board bill for 3 months , and Y sued to recover the amount of the 3 months ' board . Discuss the ruling in this case if Y had been charging X $130 a month and X were wealthy . Would you change your ruling if X were poor and had been working his way through college ? Why ? 4 . X , a minor , is in dire need of groceries for his wife and family . He enters Y 's grocery store and obtains some groceries , which he charges . He then enters Z 'm store and purchases more of the same groceries , which he also charges . When Y and Z render their bill , X refuses to pay . Witnesses testify that X told both Y and Z that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a supply . ( a ) Could Y collect ? Why ? ( b ) Could Z collect ? Why ? 6 . X , a minor , bought an automobile for $500 . He paid $400 cash and gave his note for $100 payable in 6 months . When the note came due , he refused to pay but kept the car . Would X 's action be upheld in a court of law ? Why ? 6 . X was subject to periods of insanity , but his mental incapacity was of such a nature that it was not readily ascertainable . Y , a stranger , contracted with X to purchase certain goods , not necessaries , paid a fair price for them , and later disposed of the goods to a third party . Later still , X sought to set the transaction aside on the grounds of insanity . Could he succeed ? Why ? 7. ( a ) If , in Prob . 6 , Z had previously told Y that X was sometimes insane , would it have made any difference ? ( b @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still had the goods intact and X had offered to return the purchase price ; would a court order Y to return the goods ? ( c ) Let the contract in Prob . 6 be executory on X 's part . Could Y force delivery of the goods if X had spent the purchase money and if it were shown that X had been legally declared insane a year previously but that Y did not know of such a declaration at the inc tiof the original agreement ?  | 8 . X , a minor , 6 months before reaching his majority sold the rights to certain timber on his land to Y for $500 . This agreement was still executory by both parties at the time when X reached his majority . At that time Z , who had done work for X amounting to $500 , sought to set X 's contract with Y aside and take the timber in payment of the $500 due him . Z 's contention was that X was a minor at the time the agreement was made and that a minor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. X , who operated a millinery shop in her own name , needed capital . She obtained a loan from the First National Bank and gave as security a mortgage on her shop . Upon failure to pay , the bank sought to collect from Mr. X , the lady 's husband . Is Mr. X liable ? Why ? If , instead of borrowing from the bank , Mrs. X had borrowed the money from Mr. X , could Mr. X foreclose and take the shop if Mrs. X had failed to pay ? 10 . The XYZ Company was incorporated to buy and sell securities , and this was definitely stated in their articles of incorporation . This company , however , entered into contracts to buy and sell grain on the side . The farmers ' cooperative of B State , failing to deliver a certain quantity of grain contracted for by the XYZ Company , set up the defense when sued that the XYZ Company was not competent to contract for grain . Decide the case .  | OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE The second essential of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds , those which involve legal consequences and those which do not . Therefore , the first fundamental principle of the agreement is that it must be entered into with a serious intent . One must expect to be bound thereby . The second principle is that it must pertain to business , as contrasted with pleasure . Business is here used in its broadest sense . However , making an agreement as a practical joke is often a serious business . Should the second party be serious and honestly believe the first party to be serious , the first party may be held , notwithstanding the fact that he intended his statement as a joke . An agreement is ordinarily created in two well-defined steps , ( 1 ) the offer and ( 2 ) the acceptance . 1 . The Offer . There are a number of rules that govern the making of a valid offer . a . The Offer Must Be Explicit . Not only must the statement he explicit , but the subject matter or the article or articles offered must be definitely mentioned . Examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might sell his ( Smith 's ) radio set this fall , this is not an offer to which Brown may hold Smith , for it is not a definite statement . 2 . If Smith tells Brown he will sell some lumber , this again is not an offer , since nothing was said as to what lumber is involved , where it is located , or what its price is to be . b . The Offer Must Be Communicated to the Party Accepting It . This means actual communication . Thus , if Smith tells his friend Brown that , he will sell his radio set to Allen for $150 and Brown , without authority , tells Allen about this , Allen can not hold Smith to the offer , for it has not been communicated . There is an apparent exception to this rule in the case of public offers ' , broadcast generally , such as those offering a reward for information leading to the capture and conviction of a criminal . In this case the offer is considered to be made to each person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held that , if a party gives information which leads to the arrest 182  | and conviction of a criminal for whom a reward has been offered , without knowing that a reward is offered , he can not recover . In a similar manner , it follows that , if a man does some work for another without the request or knowledge of the latter , he can not recover . Example : Bartholomew v. Jackson ( 20 N.Y . 28 ) was an action to recover services for removing a stack of wheat kept on plaintiff 's field by the defendant . Defendant had promised to remove the wheat prior to plowing by plaintiff . Plaintiff , relying on defendant 's promise , set fire to the field to clear it for plowing and later discovered that the wheat had not been removed . To save the wheat , plaintiff removed it and sought to recover for the labor . The court held that there had been no offer expressed or implied and no promise to pay for the service and that therefore there could be no recovery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man humanely bestows his labor , and even risks his life , in voluntarily aiding to preserve his neighbor 's house from destruction by fire , the law considers the services rendered as gratuitous . " c . An Offer May Stipulate the Time , Place , or Method of Acceptance , or All Three . An offer which stipulates a time limit expires after that time is up , and no subsequent acceptance is binding . If no time is specified , then the offer is said to remain open for a reasonable time . What is a reasonable time , of course , depends upon the circumstances surrounding the case , such as the subject matter , relation of parties , or any other facts that might lead to a fair determination of what would be a reasonable time under the existing conditions . d . An Offer May Be Withdrawn . An offer is made irrevocable only by acceptance . It may be withdrawn up to the time of acceptance , but notice of revocation dates from the time such revocation is actually received . Example : Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-ampere alternating current meters at $8 each . " After considering the offer for a day Brown wrote Smith accepting the offer and actually posted the letter . A half hour afterward Brown received a telegram withdrawing the offer . In this case Brown could hold Smith to the offer , for acceptance was made before the notice of withdrawal reached the cc.cceptor. 2 . The Acceptance . In the case of the acceptance , also , certain rules must be followed . a . The Terms of the Acceptance Must Be Identical with Those of the Offer . This principle is illustrated in the case of Minneapolis &; St. Louis H.R. v. Columbus Rolling Mills ( 119 U.S. 149 ) . In this case plaintiff asked for a quotation on iron rails from defendant . On Oct. 8 defendant wrote to plaintiff offering 3,000 to 6,000 tons of iron rails at a certain price and added , " If accepted , we shall expect to be notified prior to Oct. 20 . " On Oct. l ( i plaintiff wired , " You may enter our order for 2,000 tons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ou Oct. 18 the defendant wired that it could not hook so small an order at that price . The next day  | plaintiff wired for 3,000 tons at the price originally quoted . The defendant refused to fill the order . In an action for breach of contract , it was held that the telegram of Oct. 16 was not an acceptance , for it differed in terms from the offer , and that , therefore , it amounted to a rejection , so that the second telegram was of no avail . b . There Must Be No Qualification or Condition in the Acceptance . Thus in the case of Baker v. Holt ( 56 Wis. 100 ) it was held that the acceptance was not valid , for it contained a condition . In this case defendant in Connecticut wrote plaintiff in Wisconsin , offering to sell him certain lands at a specified price , but said nothing as to method or place of payment . Plaintiff replied that he would take the land upon the terms mentioned but added the condition that the deed be executed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . c . The Acceptance Must Be Communicated . It is not sufficient that the acceptor make a mental reservation to accept . He must actually communicate his acceptance . Under some circumstances conduct of such a nature as to leave no doubt of the intent to accept will be construed as an acceptance , but if the acceptor would avoid possible litigation , he should make a definite acceptance . Whether or not the acceptance reaches the offerer is immaterial . Example : White v. Conies ( 46 N.Y . 467 ) was an appealed case in which plaintiff , a contractor , had received from defendant a note stating that plaintiff could start at once fitting up certain offices . Without replying , plaintiff bought lumber and prepared to begin work . The following day defendant withdrew the offer . It was held that there was no agreement , for the mere buying of lumber was not an act sufficient to notify the offerer . A mere mental determination to accept can not be construed as an acceptance . This case also illustrates a valid withdrawal . In 107 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick to the address of an offerer who had offered to buy said carload was conduct sufficient to be construed as an acceptance . d . The Acceptance Is Binding as Soon as Made . In this respect the acceptance differs from the offer . It is not necessary that the offerer have knowledge of it . If there is a time limit prescribed , the acceptance must be within that , time ; if there is no time limit , it must be made within a reasonable time . If the method of acceptance is prescribed , the acceptance must conform to it ; but if no method is specified , then the acceptance should be made by the same means as those by which the offer was made . If an offer is received by mail and nothing is said to the contrary in the offer , the acceptance should be mailed and will be binding as soon as it is dropped into the letter box . In a similar way , if the oITer is sent by  | telegraph , it should be accepted by telegraph ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Example : In Taylor v. Merchants Fire Ins . Co. ( 9 U.S. 390 ) defendants wrote plaintiff that they would insure his house for $57 . Plaintiff replied the same day , accepting the offer and enclosing a check . The next day , but before the letter of acceptance had reached defendants , plaintiff 's house burned . In an action to recover , it was held that the acceptance was binding . REVIEW PROBLEMS 1 . On Apr. 20 a letter reached X from Y containing an offer and adding that the offer must be accepted on or before Apr. 25 . Assume that X writes a properly phrased letter of acceptance on Apr. 23 . Is the acceptance binding in each of the following cases ? ( a ) Letter reaches Yon Apr. 24. ( b ) Letter reaches Y 's office on Apr. 24 , but Y 's secretary fails to give it to Y until Apr. 26. ( c ) The letter is delayed in the mails and does not reach Y until Apr. 27. ( d ) X 's secretary fails to post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Y withdrawing the offer reaches X before X posts his letter of acceptance to Y. ( f ) A letter from Y withdrawing the offer reaches X after X has posted his letter but before X 's letter reaches Y. 2 . Suppose that , in Prob . 1 , X had telegraphed his acceptance . Would the acceptance be binding in each of the following cases ? ( a ) Telegram reaches Y on Apr. 24. ( b ) Telegram reaches Y on Apr. 26. ( c ) Telegram reaches Y 's city on Apr. 24 , but the local telegraph office fails to deliver the telegram until Apr. 26. ( d ) Telegram reaches Y 's office on Apr. 24 , but Y 's office force fails to give it to Y until Apr. 26. 3 . Y wrote X a letter dated May 29 offering 50 type S electric refrigerators with white enamel finish at $150 each and adding that acceptance must be made on or before June 10 . X replied by letter posted June 7 , which said , " I accept your offer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 of them are finished in. cream-colored enamel . " Is this acceptance binding ? Why ? ( b ) Y replied to X that he could not furnish type S refrigerators in cream color . X then telegraphed Y accepting all white refrigerators . This telegram reached Y on June 9 . In the meantime Y had disposed of the refrigerators elsewhere . Had Y a right to dispose of the refrigerators before June 10 ? Why ? 4 . At 10 A.M. X received a telegram from Y offering a special price on 10 airconditioning units . Later X left his office and , after attending to certain business matters , dropped into the telegraph office and sent a telegram to Y accepting his offer . This telegram was stamped " Received at 12:15 P.M. " Upon returning to his office at 1:30 P.M. , X found a telegram stamped " Delivered at 11:30 A.M. " from Y withdrawing the offer . Was X 's acceptance binding ? Why ? 5 . The AC Power Company asked for bids on a new plant . A number of bidders sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bid was the lowest . The president of the power company met X on the street and said , " You are the lucky man . " . V understood by this statement that a written agreement would be entered into later and made preparations to begin the construction . Later , the power-company officials became doubtful of X 's ability and gave the contract to another . Could X recover for breach of contract ? If so , why ? 6 . X leased a warehouse from Y. Y told X that the building would be ready for him on Mar. 1 . On Mar. 2 X took possession of the building and started to move in a quantity of goods when he discovered several cases of merchandise belonging to Y. Ile removed these cases and than sought to collect from Y for the expense of removing them . Could he collect ? Why ?  | 7. ( a ) X tells Y he expects to sell his contracting business in the spring . Can Y hold X to this offer ? Why ? ( b ) X tells his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck for $300 cash . Y tells his friend Z about this . Can Z hold X to his offer ? Why ? 8. ( a ) X , while driving , passed Y , who was having engine trouble . X stopped and assisted Y in getting his car started but in the process ruined a suit of clothes . Later X sued Y for the price of the suit . Could he collect ? Why ? ( b ) Suppose , in the above case , that X had been hurt and sought to recover medical expenses . Could he collect in this case ? Why ? 9 . On June 1 the board of directors of the AC Power Company met . The following statement appeared in the minutes of this meeting : " Mr. X moved that the ABC Appraisal Company be given the contract to make the valuation of our B Street plant . Seconded by Mr. Y and passed . " Nothing further was done about it , and the ABC Company brought suit for breach of contract , basing its claim on the minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 10 . Farmer X captures and turns over to the authorities a suspicious character whom he has found hiding in his barn . This man turns out to be a criminal for whom a reward for capture has been posted . Could Farmer X collect the reward ? Why ?  | REALITY OF CONSENT Although an agreement is essential , as we have just seen , it alone is not sufficient ; there must be also a " reality of consent , " or " meeting of the minds " as it is sometimes called . Smith might say to Brown , " I will sell you my boat for $500 , " and Brown might reply , " I will give you $500 for your boat . " This would appear to be an agreement consisting of a legal offer and acceptance . But later it develops that Brown was thinking all the time of Smith 's sailboat , while Smith had in mind his motorboat . In this example there has been an agreement , but there has not been a meeting of the minds of the contracting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always a presumption of reality of consent in a contract executed in due form . If either party desires to set it aside on the ground that the minds have not met on the same thing in the same sense , he must prove one of the following things : 1 . That there has been a mutual mistake . 2 . That there has been an innocent misrepresentation. 3 . That there has been a fraudulent misrepresentation. 4 . That undue influence was exerted . 5 . That duress was practiced . Each of these will be considered in turn . 1 . Mutual Mistake . a . Definition . A mistake is a mutual misunderstanding arising from some erroneous conviction of law or fact . It should be noticed that this definition excludes carelessness , negligence , or folly ; therefore a mistake must arise from an error that ordinary diligence could not foresee . Also , the misunderstanding must be mutual . A mistake of one of the contracting parties alone will not ordinarily void the contract . Furthermore , a mistake due to simple ignorance of law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of fact , then the contract is void . b . A Mistake as to the Identity of the Subject Matter . In Kyle v. Kavanagh ( 103 Mass. 356 ) it happened that the defendant thought he was buying a certain piece of land , while the plaintiff had in mind another tract of land . The court held that , although there was no fraud on the part of the plaintiff , the mistake alone was a good defense .  | c . A Mistake as to the Existence of the Thing Contracted for . On Sept. 25 , Smith entered into a contract with Brown to sell a certain house in a neighboring town for $6,000 , which Brown paid . On Sept. 24 , unknown to Smith , the house burned . Brown may recover the $6,000 , for the house was nonexistent at the time the contract was made . d . A Mistake as to the Price to Be Paid . During a coal strike , Smith , an Englishman , contracted to deliver to Brown , an American , 1,000 tons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought he was paying $8 a ton while Smith had meant 8 crowns ( $9.60 ) per ton . Brown would not be bound , nor would Smith , for there was a mutual mistake concerning the price to be paid . e . A Mistake as to Person . A bilateral or mutual mistake as to person is not very common , and when it is unilateral , the appropriate action is of assumpsit , as discussed under quasi contracts . If A enters into a contract thinking and intending to contract with B , when in fact he has been dealing with C , it is obvious that there has been no meeting of the minds . It would appear that neither A nor B is bound if neither so desires , but if B accepts the benefits , A may force payment in an action of assumpsit if he so desires . C would appear to be bound by A if A so desired . In an old case , 123 Mass. 28 , vender A had furnished B a service over a period of time when B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later , without notice to B , vender C merged with vender A. It was held that the merged firm could not collect from B for services subsequently rendered , on the grounds that there was no meeting of the minds . 2 . Misrepresentation . Some writers make a distinction between a mistake , which we have just considered , and an innocent misstatement of a fact or misrepresentation . The difference seems to be that contracts in which innocent misrepresentation is proved are voidable and not void , as are the contracts in which there are legal mistakes . A misstatement is either unintentional or intentional . If the former , it is essentially a mistake ; if the latter , it is fraud . For our present purpose it will he sufficient to consider fraud only . a . Fraud Defined . There are many elements that must be proved by a party claiming fraud . ( 1 ) There must be a false representation that , is not obviously untrue with regard to a material fact , past or present . ( 2 ) The representation must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of its falsity or in reckless disregard as to whether it is true or false . ( 3 ) It must be made with the intention that it will he acted upon by the plaintiff . ( 4 ) The representation must be believed and relied upon by the plaintiff , and it must be at least one of the reasons  | which caused him to act . ( 5 ) The plaintiff , having acted upon the representation , must actually suffer damage or loss . 1 . MATERIAL FACT . The first element of fraud is that it must be a misstatement of , a material fact that is past or present . This obviously excludes mere opinion or a prediction of the future , such as a statement that " this property will be worth double its present value in 10 years . " Also the reader should note carefully the difference in the statements that a certain article costs $100 and that a certain article is worth $100 . The former is a statement of fact , past or present , while the latter is merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ v. Butler ( 105 U.S. 553 ) plaintiff loaned some money to defendant and took as security a mortgage on some real estate containing a stone quarry , which had not been worked enough to show its real value . Defendant had furnished the certificates of two persons , who had lived in the neighborhood for a long time and who stated that in their best judgment the property was worth over 100 per cent more than the loan . Upon foreclosure , the land brought only a fractional part of the value of the loan . Plaintiff charged fraud . The court held that he could not recover , for an expression of opinion , however inaccurate , is not cause for action . 2 . KNOWLEDGE OF PERSON MAKING THE STATEMENT . The second element of fraud states that the party making the misstatement must know that his representation is false or is made in reckless disregard as to whether it is true or not . Also , if a party makes a statement , not knowing whether it is true or not , it is fraud . Example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defendant represented to plaintiff that a certain party left an estate of $40,000 above all liabilities , when , in fact , the party was insolvent . It was shown that defendant believed her representations to be true . The court held that there was no cause for action . 3 . INTENT . The third element states that a misrepresentation , if it is to be considered a fraud , must be made directly to the party acting , with the intent that he act upon it . However , it may be made through a third party , as in the following case . Example : In Eaton v. Avery ( 83 N.Y . 31 ) defendants made false representations to a mercantile agency concerning the financial standing of defendant 's firm and then asked credit of plaintiff . The plaintiff , relying on information given him by the mercantile agency , extended credit to defendant and lost . In an action to recover on the basis of fraud , it was held that plaintiff could recover , since the purpose for which information is given to mercantile agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscribers . The defendants , in giving such information , did it with the intent of defrauding anyone who might inquire of the agency . 4 . ACTION ON PART OF PLAINTIFF NECESSARY . The fourth element requires not only that the plaintiff believe and rely upon the statement but that lie also act upon it . Thus in Seldon v. Davidson ( 85 Wis. 138 ) defendant induced plaintiff to lease certain premises and in so doing  | intentionally concealed the fact that a barn on them did not " go with " the property . However , it was not shown that this concealment contributed to plaintiff 's leasing the property , and therefore there was no action for deceit. 5 . DAMAGE OR LOSS MUST RESULT . The fifth and last essential to establish fraud is equally important . Although all the first four elements are present , if the plaintiff does not suffer loss or damage , he has no action for fraud . Example : In Brown v. Blunt ( 72 Me. 415 ) plaintiff owed defendant a sum of money , which he refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debt . Plaintiff sued , charging fraud . It was held that , as plaintiff had not suffered any damage , legally at least , in paying his just debt , he could not recover . b . How Fraud May Arise . Fraud may arise ( 1 ) from actual fraudulent misrepresentation , ( 2 ) by artful concealment , ( 3 ) by concealing a fact that , as a legal duty , one ought to disclose , and ( 4 ) by suppression of a truth , amounting to a falsehood . The following are examples : 1 . A party , about to purchase a farm , asked if the neighborhood were healthy , declining to buy if it were not . The vendor assured the party that the neighborhood was healthy , when in fact it was fever-infested . The court held that the agreement to purchase could not be enforced . Holmes ' Appeal ( 77 Pa. 50 ) . 2 . Smith had a horse that had many ailments . Smith doctored up the horse so that the ailments were not noticeable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sound so far as I know , but I never warrant a horse . " This was held as fraud on the part of Smith , since he did not tell Brown of the ailments , which would have kept Brown from buying . Jones v. Edwards ( 1 Neb. 170 ) . 3 . Smith , while being examined for an insurance policy , concealed the fact that for the past 22 years he had had high blood pressure . It was held that this was a fraudulent concealment of a fact which , as a legal duty , he ought to have disclosed . Smith v. Aetna Life Ins . Co. ( 49 N.Y . 211 ) . 4 . Smith , a rancher , sold Brown a herd of cattle that had Texas fever , without disclosing the fact to Brown . It was held that this was a suppression of a truth , amounting to falsehood . Grigsby v. Stapleton ( 9,1 Mo . 423 ) . c . Remedy for Fraud . A party who has had fraud practiced upon hint may do any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 2 . Rescind the contract , unless the rights of others have intervened . 3 . Sue for damages for deceit , after affirming the contract . 4 . If the contract is executory , he may breach it and , if sued , set up the defense of fraud .  | However , if he decides to rescind the contract , he must do so immediately upon becoming aware of the fraud . If he accepts any benefits thereafter , it is considered an affirmance . In Crooks v. Nip poll ( 44 Minn. 239 ) defendant showed plaintiff a valuable piece of land in order to induce plaintiff to buy another piece of land not so valuable . After learning of the deception , plaintiff took steps to obtain credit and have the deed recorded . The curt held that these acts amounted to an affirmance and that plaintiff could not recover . d . Contracts in Which Caveat Emptor Applies . Caveat emptor means " let the buyer beware " and is said to apply to the sale of goods when such goods are displayed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inspect them . In Boland v. Brownell ( 131 Mass. 138 ) plaintiff bought a half interest in defendant 's business , after having had ample opportunity to inspect the stock and the books . It was held that plaintiff could not hold defendant on his representation of the amount of business previously done or on the value of the goods . If the vendor , however , warrants his goods , then an action can arise for breach of warranty . The difference between a warranty and representation is rather fine and is too technical for consideration here . e . Contracts in Which Utmost Good Faith Is Said to Apply . There is , however , another group of contracts that require the exercise of utmost good faith upon the part of the vendor . Contracts for fire and life insurance and the sale of land , stocks , and bonds are examples of such contracts . 3 . Undue Influence . Undue influence is likely to exist where the parties are not on an equality as to knowledge or ability . It exists where one party of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak will or inferior knowledge , through family connection , confidential relationship , or dire need . a . Presumption of Undue Influence . A court of equity will very carefully investigate , on the presumption of undue influence , contracts between a husband and wife , parent and child , guardian or trustee and ward , attorney and client , doctor and patient , and priest and penitent because of the peculiar opportunities that are present for the one to take advantage of the other . b. ? Remedy . Contracts entered into under undue influence are voidable but not void . They will be set aside by request of the party injured unless theparty injuring can prove that the contract was fair , just , and reasonable . Examples : 1 . Smith inherited a piece of land , worth about $8,000 , from an uncle . Smith 's father induced hire to deed the land to Smith , senior , for $2,000 . Although Smith was of age , it was shown that his father had taken advantage of his son 's lack of business sense . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the son requested it .  | 2 . If , in the above case , Smith had been simple-minded or old and weak-minded and had been induced to sell to a real-estate agent , whether related to him or not , the same decision would undoubtedly have been made . 3 . Finally , suppose Smith to be the only son of a wealthy man and in dire need of funds . Brown , a moneylender , agrees to lend Smith , who is twenty-one years of age , $1,000 if he ( Smith ) will legally make an assignment of his rights to his father 's estate . Believing himself helpless , Smith signs such a document . A court of equity , upon Smith 's request , would undoubtedly allow Brown only $1,000 and interest at the prevailing rate . 4 . Duress . If a man enters into a contract because of actual physical violence to his person or that of his wife , parent , or child , or to escape a threat of personal violence to himself or his wife , parent , or child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may avoid the contract . Such unlawful constraint is called duress , and a contract based on duress is voidable . Threat of a lawsuit is not duress where there is no danger of injury or destruction of property and where there is opportunity to try the case legally . Examples : 1 . Smith was working in a field when Brown assaulted him and violently beat him . Smith cried for mercy , and Brown agreed to stop if Smith would sign a promissory note for $100 ; this Smith agreed to do . This would be a case of actual duress . 2 . Smith signed several promissory notes under threat of arrest by Brown , who had procured a warrant of arrest for the purpose of forcing Smith to sign the notes and not to punish him for a crime . This is a case of duress by threat . Modern laws about duress are much more liberal than the old English common law . In the latter there was no duress of goods , only of person . Some more recent decisions have recognized a form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duress by force or imprisonment . REVIEW PROBLEMS 1 . X had a beautiful Oriental rug with a blue background . Being in need of ready cash , he went to Y , a furniture dealer , and offered him the rug for $500 . Y replied in the presence of witnesses that he remembered the rug well , for he had recently delivered furniture at X 's home , that he knew of a customer who was in the market , for such a rug , and that he would therefore be glad to give X $500 for it . It developed later that Y had thought all the time that the rug had a brown background , and since his customer did not want one with a blue background , he refused to buy . X sued . Y set up the defense of mistake . Is the defense good ? Why ? 2 . X contracted to buy a residence from Y. He planned to make a two-family house out of it and rent one side while living in the other . Before signing the agreement to purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the plan was feasible . Before final payments were made , X discovered that a zoning law would prevent him from making the house over as he had planned , and he declined to buy . Y sued . X set up the defense of mutual mistake . Was the defense good ? Why ? 3 . X purchased certain stocks from Y upon the latter 's representation of the present and future value of the stock . The evidence showed that the statements were false and made with the intent of causing X to buy , but the evidence also showed  | that X had disposed of the stock for enough more than he had paid for them to cover the interest on his money for the period in which they were in his possession . In a suit charging fraud would X be successful ? Why ? 4 . X forged the name of his father to a note . Upon discovery of the forgery , the bank informed the father that , if the latter did not countersign the note , the bank would expose the son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities . Is a note signed under such conditions binding ? Why ? 5 . X , an aged widow with several living children , with whom she was on the best of terms , met a young man in his early twenties . She had known this man for only about 6 months when she deeded all her real property to him , thus disinheriting her own children . What redress at law would the children have , if any ? 6 . X told Y that his car was a 1947 model , although he was aware that it was a 1946 model ; he made the statement falsely , knowing that Y was a good friend of Z , who was in the market for a 1947 model like that owned by X. Z bought the car from X on the strength of Y 's statement . X made no statement to Z about the model of the car . When Z discovered that the car was a 1946 model , he sued X , charging fraud . Could he recover ? Why ? 7 . X tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a certain lot is the best buy in the city , that the city is sure to expand in the direction of the lot , and that , if he keeps it 3 or 4 years , it will at least double its present value . Y buys ; the city expands in another direction ; and two years later the lot is worth only half what it was worth when purchased . Y sues X , charging fraud . Can he recover ? Why ? 8 . X had a valuable dog , which he said before witnesses was 3 years old . Y , who was present , purchased the dog . After the purchase it was discovered that the dog was 5 years old . Which of the following conditions would support an action for damages , and why ? ( a ) X honestly believed the dog was 3 years old . ( b ) Y knew X was wrong at the time of purchase . ( c ) X made the statement falsely , but Y could not prove that he had suffered any loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a general one made to the group without any intention of defrauding any particular individual . ( e ) Y was unable to show that the statement in any way influenced his decision to buy .  | CONSIDERATION 1 . Definition . Consideration is the act or forbearance of one party which is given in exchange for the act or promise of the other . In every executory contract there must be a consideration to support it , viz. , something of value received . There are four essentials to a valid consideration . These are as follows : ( 1 ) It must have value . ( 2 ) It must be legal . ( 3 ) It must be possible . ( 4 ) It must be present or future . 2 . The Use of the Seal as a Consideration . Before taking up these essentials of a valid consideration , it will be well to discuss an apparent exception to the rule requiring a consideration . According to the old English common law , the use of the seal was said to import a consideration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inscribed with the coat of arms of the contracting parties , was considered sufficient evidence that the parties were serious in their intentions . Modern substitutes for the old wax seal and ribbon consist of colored paper disks pasted upon the document . In some states the written word " seal , " a scratch of the pen , or the letters L.S. are considered sufficient , especially if the parties make a statement such as " In witness thereof we have hereunto set our hands and seals . " At the present time the seal has lost most of its original significance , except that in some states the formality implied by the seal extends the time before the statute of limitations will bar action on a sealed document over that of a written one without seal . Also when the seal is attached to a gratuitous promise or gift , as in the following case , it retains some of its former significance . Example : Smith gave his daughter a written instrument under seal , promising to pay her a sum of money . This money was part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , and although there were no legal obligations involved , he felt it should go to his daughter . In an action to recover , the defense was lack of consideration . The court held that , since the promise was intended to be gratuitous , the seal imported sufficient consideration . Alley v. Aller ( 40 N.J. 446 ) . In this connection it will be noted that a mere promise to give a present can not be enforced because of lack of consideration ; but if the gift , is delivered , the contract becomes executed , and an executed contract will not be set aside because of lack of consideration . 104  | 3 . The Consideration Must Have Value . Returning now to the essentials of a valid consideration , the first is that it must have value . This means , not that the value of the consideration must be adequate , only that the consideration must have what the law will deem to be value . Anyone of age who is a competent party is deemed to be able to make his own bargains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the law will leave him alone . However , there are other things than money that are regarded as of value as a consideration . These will now be discussed . 4 . Consideration for the Discharge of a Debt . The first of these is an exception to the statement that the amount of money is of no importance . The courts are uniform in holding that a smaller sum of money is not the legal equivalent of a larger one due . Suppose that Smith owed Brown $500 , which he was unable to pay in full . He offered to pay Brown $450 if Brown would call the debt canceled . Later Brown sued Smith for the balance . In this case a court would hold that the first contract was without consideration and that Brown could hold Smith for the balance . But if something other than money is offered in lieu of the balance , whether or not it is adequate , the contract is binding . Thus , if in the above case Brown had agreed to take $450 plus two storage batteries worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown could not have sued Smith for the balance . In like manner , if the amount of debt is in dispute , a compromise to take less is valid . Thus , if Smith and Brown can not agree as to whether the amount due was $500 or $400 , a compromise on $450 would be binding . This applies also to a case in which a number of creditors agree to take less for the total amount due , say 50 cents on the dollar . The forbearance of one creditor is said to be the consideration for the others , who might lose the whole . Example : Smith and Company , an insolvent firm , entered into an agreement with their creditors by which the creditors agreed to accept 25 cents on the dollar and give a receipt in full for their several claims . All the creditors agreed to this plan . It was held that the contract was valid , and the firm was discharged from all indebtedness . Pierce v. Jones ( 8 S.C . 273 ) . 5 . Consideration for the Extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a debt , a mere promise to extend the time of payment of a note due is void for want of a consideration , unless some additional inducement or concession is made . Thus in Warner v. Campbell ( 26 Ill. 282 ) it was held that the promise to extend the time of payment of a promissory note was valid if the interest was paid in advance . The payment of the interest in advance wits tiie consideration or concession necessary .  | A similar situation exists where a contractor , having agreed to build a certain structure for a fixed sum of money , refuses to complete the job unless an additional sum is paid him by the owner . This the owner agrees to do . However , in the end the contractor can not force the owner to pay this additional sum , as the owner may set up the defense that his promise to pay the extra money is without consideration . 6 . A Promise as a Consideration . A promise may be a sufficient consideration if it comes from the promisee and provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a legal right to do . Examples : 1 tobacco , swearing , and playing cards or billiards for money until he became twenty-one years of age , he ( Smith ) would give him ( John ) $5,000 . John lived up to the agreement in every particular , but Smith refused to pay the money , claiming lack of consideration . It is true that there was no consideration so far as Smith was concerned , but John gave up a legal right . He had a right to do these things if he wanted to , and his forbearance was a sufficient consideration . The court held in favor of John . Hamer v. Sidway ( 124 N.Y . 538 ) . 2 . In an action on a note given in consideration of a parent naming his child after the maker of the note , it was held that there was a sufficient consideration , for the parent gave up the right to name the child . Wolford v. Powers ( 85 Ind . 294 ) . The great majority of contracts are of the bilateral-promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In engineering contracts the contractor promises faithfully to perform in return for the owner 's promise to pay him a specified sum when due . However , the intrinsic consideration for the owner is the acquisition of new property and for the contractor the sum of money for his services in creating the new property . 7 . Settlement to Avoid Litigation . If a party drops a pending suit or refrains from suing , this is a sufficient consideration . Example : In Parker v. Enslow ( 102 Ill. 272 ) defendant kept tobacco on the counter of his store for the use of the public . Plaintiff was in the habit of refilling his pipe daily with this tobacco . As a joke , defendant mixed an explosive with the tobacco , which exploded in the plaintiff 's face , injuring him . Plaintiff threatened to sun defendant . As a compromise settlement out of court , defendant gave plaintiff a promissory note . In an action to recover the note , it was held that a settlement to avoid litigation was a sufficient consideration . 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a valid consideration is that it must be legal . A promise to perform an unlawful act , is not binding . Example : Smith , a lawyer , brought suit for services in presenting the claims of tim Miami Indians at Washington . The defense was that these services were as a Iohhh , yist and therefore illegal . In charging the jury , the judge said that it was for the jury to determine whether the services were as an attorney , to draw up a paper , or as x lobbyist . If the former , the contract was binding ; if the latter , it was not , ; if both , the illegal part invalidated the legal . McBratney v. Chandler ( 22 Kan. 092 ) .  | 9 . Consideration Must Be Possible . A promise to perform an impossible act is not a sufficient consideration . The impossibility , however , must be an obvious physical impossibility as contrasted to mere difficulty , pecuniary or otherwise . The thing promised may be nonexistent in part or in its entirety . The former is partial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Examples : 1 . Smith and Brown both lived in New York . Smith owned an orange grove in Florida and had on hand 100 cases of oranges , which he contracted to sell to Brown . It developed that the day before the contract was signed a cyclone had destroyed the oranges . Brown could recover the price he had paid , for the consideration had failed entirely . If , however , the oranges had been destroyed an hour after the signing of the contract , Brown would have had to accept the loss . 2 . Smith , agent for a certain meter manufacturer , residing in San Francisco , contracted with Brown to sell Brown 100 meters , then in transit from the East , at $8 per meter . It developed later that 30 of the meters had been severely damaged in a wreck prior to the making of the contract . In this case Brown would be required to pay for only 70 meters. 10 . Consideration Must Be Present or Future . It sometimes happens that a man , out of gratitude , offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving his life , or for forbearance from an act in the past . Such acts are gratuitous and provide no consideration . On the other hand , if the past consideration is coupled with a present or future consideration , or if there has been a request , either implied or expressed , previous to the past consideration , a promise to pay later will be upheld . Examples : 1 . Smith saved Brown from drowning . Later , out of gratitude , Brown gave Smith a promissory note for $100 . Such a note could not be enforced , for it is based on a past consideration . 2 . Smith gave Brown a valuable dog . Later , out of gratitude for the present of the dog and for $5 that Smith promised to pay him , Brown agreed to dig the foundation for Smith 's new house . This contract would be supported by a valid consideration . REVIEW PROBLEMS 1 . X , a contractor , offered to install , during his spare time , additional outlets in Y 's house for the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some time after the work was done , X had occasion to need Y 's services ; Y at first agreed to furnish said services in consideration for what X had done but later refused , claiming lack of consideration . Decide the case . 2 .

Suppose that X is a personal friend of the district attorney and that Y 's son has just been arrested for speeding . Y agrees to give X the contract for wiring Y 's new house if X will get his friend , the district attorney , to reduce his son 's fine . X is successful in getting the fine reduced , but Y refuses to keep his promise , claiming lack of consideration . Discuss the ease . 4 . X offered to sell Y an antique desk he had for $20 . Y accepted , paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove the desk . In the meantime Z had told X  | that the desk was worth at least $100 ; when Y returned , X tendered back the $20 and refused to deliver the desk , claiming insufficient consideration .

Later X discovered that the box was an obsolete model and was worth only about $50 , and he refused to pay $200 for it . Can Y hold X to this agreement ? Why ? 6 . Mr. X met and became well acquainted with a young man , Mr. Y. As Mr. X had no descendants , he wished to perpetuate the name of X and proposed to Mr. Y that the latter legally change his name to X ; in consideration for this act the first Mr. X would turn over to the new Mr. X a considerable fortune .

Despairing of receiving the whole $8,000 , X accepted , in full payment for the $8,000 , a note for $4,000 secured by a chattel mortgage on the personal property of Y. The note was paid on time , and the chattel mortgage was satisfied . However , X brought suit for the balance of the original debt of $8,000 . Could he recover ? Why ? 8 . Mr. X promised Miss Y that , if she would marry him , he would deed over to her a summer estate on Long Island . This statement was put in writing by Mr. X and signed by him .

Decide the ease .  | LAWFUL SUBJECT MATTER The fifth essential to every valid contract is that one must agree to do or to refrain from doing some lawful act or thing . Contracts that are executory and ( 1 ) are in conflict with the written law or ( 2 ) are opposed to common law or ( 3 ) are contrary to public policy will not be enforced . If such contracts are executed , the courts will not consider the case . The fact that a person enters into an illegal contract unknowingly does not offer a basis for relief in case of loss or damage suffered thereby . 1 . Contracts Contrary to the Written Law . There are , of course , an unlimited number of contracts that would be contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states having different laws . Some of the more common are the following : a . Compliance with Licensing Laws Necessary . A statute requiring physicians , lawyers , or engineers to be licensed makes a contract by such persons , if not licensed , void . Example : Smith , a physician , was called in by Brown . Smith continued to visit Brown for about six months , and in this time he obtained his license to practice medicine . It was held that he could not recover for his services prior to obtaining his license , upon any contract expressed or implied . Gardner v. Tatum ( 81 Cal . 370 ) . b . Legality of Bets and Wagers . Most states also have enacted statutes prohibiting the making of bets and wagers . Therefore any contract to collect a wager or a gambling debt is void in such states . c . Desecration of the Sabbath . Most states also have a statute prohibiting the desecration of the Sabbath . Therefore , any contract in violation , of this statute is void . Example : Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In an action to recover , it was held that contracts for private gain made on Sunday are illegal . Clough , v. Goggins ( 40 Iowa 325 ) . d . Usury or Illegal Interest . All states have fixed a legal rate of interest ; , and most of them have provided a maximum rate , with a penalty for exceeding that rate . In Indiana the legal rate is 6 per cent , the maximum 8 per cent . The penalty for exceeding the maximum rate is forfeiture of all interest in excess of 6 per cent . Contracts which charge a rate 100  | of interest above that allowed by law are called usurious contracts and are void ( see Chap . 3 ) . 2 . Contracts Contrary to Common Law . There are a number of contracts that are contrary to the unwritten or common law and that are therefore void . a . Contracts to Compound a Crime . Example : Smith signed a contract in which he agreed to pay Brown $1,000 if he ( Brown ) would help Smith hold up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown agreed to do . Later , but before the robbery was committed , he thought better of it . In this case Smith would have no legal redress . b . Contracts to Defraud a Creditor . Example : Smith entered into an agreement with Brown , who was one of several creditors of Smith , whereby he , Brown , was to receive more than his prorata share . In an action to recover , the contract was held to be void . White v. Kuntz ( 107 N.Y . 518 ) . 3 . Contracts against Public Policy . This group of contracts is numerous and varied . What is contrary to public policy is , of course , debatable , and each case must be considered on its merits . However , the following are generally considered to be against public policy and therefore void : a . Contracts to Injure the Government . Contracts to raise funds to aid an insurrection in a friendly state or to break the law of a sister state . Example : Smith , residing in Massachusetts , contracted with Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quantity of intoxicating liquors for the purpose of reselling in the State of Maine . At that time selling intoxicants in Maine was unlawful , while in Massachusetts it was permitted . In an action to recover , the contract was held void , for it had in view the breaking of a law of a sister state . Graves v. Johnson ( 156 Mass. 211 ) . b . Contracts in Unreasonable Restraint of Trade or to Establish Unlawful Monopolies . It is considered to be against public policy for one or more parties to hinder trade or competition , but it is also obvious that , if A sells his business to B , B is entitled to a reasonable protection against A 's starting up the same or a similar business next door or on the same street . Here again , what is considered a reasonable or unreasonable restraint of trade depends upon the size of the town and the type of business . Thus , to covenant that A will or will not start a grocery business in the same town might be reasonable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business anywhere within the state would very probably be considered unreasonable . On the other hand , A might , covenant not to sell a certain type of very special machinery anywhere within a state or even a group of states , and he would be reasonable in so covenanting . The following cases will make the distinction clearer .  | Examples : 1 . Smith hired Brown , a teacher of languages , for a period of six months . In the contract Brown covenanted not to teach the French or German languages anywhere within the state . It was held that this covenant was unreasonable and void , for it extended beyond the necessary protection of Smith . Herreshoff v. Boutineau ( 17 R.I. 3 ) . 2 . Smith and Company sold certificates entitling the holders thereof to medical care and treatment in case of injuries or sickness . The company developed a good business throughout Minnesota , Wisconsin , and northern Michigan . Smith and Company covenanted with Brown and Company that they would not engage in this or a similar business in the above-mentioned states for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was held that the contract was valid and not void as being in restraint of trade . National Benefit Co. v. Union Hospital Co. ( 45 Minn. 272 ) . c . Contracts to Bribe . Contracts to bribe a juror , tamper with a witness , conceal a crime , hinder the course of justice , or deprive a court of its jurisdiction are against public policy and therefore void . Example : On the night of Sept. 25 , Smith saw Brown hold up and rob Allen . In consideration of $500 , Smith agreed not to tell the authorities about it . Such a contract could not be enforced , for it was against public policy . d . Contracts Contrary to Good Morals . Such contracts would be mutual agreements to obtain a divorce and contracts that unduly affect the security or freedom of marriage . Example : In Sterling v. Sinnickson ( 5 N.J. 756 ) defendant promised to pay plaintiff $1,000 , provided that plaintiff was not married within six months . From action to recover , it was held that the contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage and marriage as a consideration are two different things . The former is against public policy , but the latter is the most valuable consideration known to law ( see Agreements in Consideration of Marriage in Chap . 19 on Statute of Frauds ) . REVIEW PROBLEMS 1 . X promises his son $1,000 if the son does not marry until after he graduates from college . Is this agreement binding ? Why ? 2 . X , who was engaged in the manufacture and sale of a well-known brand of cigarettes , sold his stock , machinery , and good will to Y and agreed that he would not enter into such a business anywhere in the United States for a period of 50 years . ( ha such an agreement be enforced ? Why ? 3 . X , a recent graduate in electrical engineering , built up a going business in radios and radio repairs in his home town of 5,000 inhabitants . He sold his business and good will to Y for $5,000 and agreed not to enter into that or a similar business within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state 60 miles away from his home town and started the same kind of business . When Y heard about this , he brought suit , claiming breach of contract . Decide the case . 4 . X Company was low bidder on a sewer to be constructed for Y City . X Company was awarded the contract and completed the sewer . The amount involved was $50,000 . The city accepted the work . At this point Z , a taxpaying citizen of the city , brought suit to enjoin the city from paying any part of the $50,000 , on the ground  | that X Company had violated an old statute which prohibited any company employed on state or municipal work from working labor more than 8 hours a day . The evidence showed that X Company had employed some of their men for occasional work lasting longer than 8 hours a day . Decide the case . 5 . X and Y appear to have about equal chances of being elected to the office of justice of the peace . Y agrees to withdraw his candidacy and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to split his fees with Y. Is such an agreement binding ? Why ? 6 . Is a check dated on a Sunday legal ? Why ? 7 . X is in need of $1,000 . A moneylender agrees to lend X $1,000 if X will pay the lender $10 a month for the use of the money . Can such an agreement be binding ? Why ?  | STATUTE OF FRAUDS The sixth essential of a valid contract has to do with its form . Some contracts are required to be in writing , and others must be under seal . In most states a conveyance of land , to be binding , must be executed by a special contract under seal ; this is called a deed . The group of contracts considered in this section are those which come under what is known as the Statute of Frauds , and these must be . in writing . The so-called " Statute of Frauds " was enacted in England about 1676 under the title of " An Act for the Prevention of Frauds and Perjuries . " This statute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been enacted in every state of the Union . Since the fourth and seventeenth sections of this act are the only ones that directly affect contracts , they alone will be considered . 1 . The Fourth Section of the Statute of Frauds . The fourth section of the Statute of Frauds reads as follows : No action shall be brought whereby to charge any executor or administrator , upon any special promise , to answer damages out of his own estate ; or whereby to charge the defendant upon any special promise to answer for the debt , default , or miscarriage of another person ; or to charge any person upon any agreement made upon consideration of marriage ; or upon any contract or sale of lands , tenements , or hereditaments , or any interest in or concerning them ; or upon any agreement that is not to be performed within the space of one year from the making thereof ; unless the agreement upon which such action shall be brought , or some memorandum or note thereof , shall be in writing and signed by the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by him lawfully authorized . One should notice that the Statute of Frauds is merely a defense . It does not say that oral contracts are void , even on these subjects . It does , however , take away the remedy ; for if the defendant can set up the defense that the oral contract comes under the Statute of Frauds and can prove it , the contract can not be enforced . It should also he noticed that the contract need not be completely written out . A memorandum is sufficient if it is signed by the party to be charged and if it states the agreement , and the consideration . Even 203  | correspondence containing a number of letters might be sufficient . However , it hardly need be mentioned that the safest policy with regard to a contract that comes under the Statute of Frauds is to have it entirely in writing . 2 . The Promise of an Executor or Administrator . An agreement to render an administrator personally liable for the debt of the deceased must be in writing . Example : Smith owed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrator , said to plaintiff that he would see that the bill was paid . This statement was not put in writing . : t was held that this agreement came under the Statute of Frauds and could not be enforced , for it was not in writing . Srnithwick v. Shepherd ( 4 N.C. 196 ) . 3 . A Promise to Answer for the Debt of Another . In order that a person may be liable for the debt , miscarriage , or default of another , the contract must be in writing or there must be an original promise . If the promise is conditional and not in writing , it comes under the Statute of Frauds . Thus , Smith said to Brown , a shopkeeper , " If Allen does not pay his bill , I will . " This is a conditional promise and comes under the Statute of Frauds ; but if he had said , " I will see that Allen 's bill is paid , " this would be considered as an independent promise , and Smith would have been liable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the payment of an obligation by another , a case of suretyship arises . In a case of suretyship there are always three individuals involved . If A agrees to pay B $5,000 for merchandise belonging to B , upon C 's engagement to be responsible if A does not pay when due , A is the one primarily liable , called the principal obligor , B is the obligee , and C is the surety , or one secondarily liable . If the above relationships are all part of the same written instrument , C is a true surety ( 35 Mich. 42 ) , but if C Makes a separate agreement with B , then C is more correctly called a guarantor . In either event both types of contracts come under the fourth section of the Statute of Frauds and must be in writing to be enforced . 4 . Agreements in Consideration of Marriage . This does not mean an agreement to marry , for such agreements need not be in writing to support an action for breach of promise . This clause in the statute refers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marriage , either by one or both of the principal parties , or by a third party . Example : Smith promised his niece Dorothy that , when she was married , he would give her $1,000 . This was not put in writing , and therefore Smith could , if he chose , set up the defense that the contract came under the statute . 5 . Contracts for the Sale of Real Estate . Under this clause there arises a nice distinction as to what is considered to be real estate . Actual land is obviously real estate , but the question as t , o whether trees , crop ? ,  | ores , oil , etc. , are real estate or personal property must be ruled upon . If they are personal property , they do not come under the statute ; but if they are part of the realty , they do . ( For property classification see Sec. 1 , Chap . 23 . ) The general rule is that the natural products in or on the land , which grow without cultivation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cut or mined by the vendor , are part of the realty . Thus , growing timber , grass on uncultivated fields , ore , etc. , are part of the realty , but crops that are planted annually or oftener , upon which the labor of man has been expended , are personal property . However , if the former natural products of the land are worked upon , they become personal property . Thus , if timber is to be cut before being sold , if grass is to be mowed , or if ore is to be mined , then these do not come under the statute . The following will help to make this distinction clearer : Examples : 1 . In Powers v. Clarkson ( 17 Kan. 218 ) it was held that the attempt , by oral agreement , to transfer grass growing on uncultivated land was unenforceable , for it came under the Statute of Frauds. 2 . Smith , an owner of a wood lot , agreed orally to deliver to Brown a certain amount of cordwood for $5 per cord . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver any more wood , setting up the defense that the contract came under the Statute of Frauds , as being an interest in real estate . It was held that , since the plaintiff had no title in the wood until cut , it was not for an interest in real estate and therefore not under the statute . Killmore v. Howlett ( 48 N.Y . 569 ) . 3 . Smith contracted to sell to Brown a quantity of wheat and barley not yet cut . This agreement was not in writing . Brown sued , charging breach of contract . Smith set up the defense that the contract was for an interest in real estate and therefore must be in writing . It was held that growing crops under cultivation which are planted annually are not part of the realty and that therefore an oral contract was binding . Marshall v. Ferguson ( 23 Cal . 65 ) . 6 . Contracts Not to Be Performed within One Year . In order that a contract may come under this clause of the statute , it must be obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be performed within the space of one year . An agreement to work for a man for life or to support a man until he dies does not come under the statute , for the man may die within a year . The fact that he may live for several years makes no difference . The agreement is based upon a contingency that may or may not arise ; therefore , it is not under the statute . The following will illustrate : Examples : 1 . Smith contracted with Brown to enter into a partnership for a period of three years . It was held that this contract was void under the Statute of Frauds , for it was not in writing . Wahl v. Barnum ( 116 N.Y . 87 ) . 2 . Smith contracted orally with Brown to act as superintendent of his ( Brown 's ) plant for one year starting in two weeks . Smith worked for several months and then was discharged . Brown set up the defense that the contract was under the Statute of Frauds and void . It wan held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 685 ) .  | 3 . Smith contracted orally to support Brown and his wife during their lifetime in consideration that Brown give Smith the use of Brown 's farm . It was held that this contract did not come under the statute . McCormick v. Drummett ( 9 Neb. 384 ) . 7 . The Seventeenth Section of the Statute of Frauds . The seventeenth section of the Statute of Frauds reads as follows : No contract for the sale of any goods , wares , or merchandise , for the price of ten pounds of sterling or upwards , shall be allowed to be good , except the buyer shall accept part of the goods so sold , and actually receive the same or give something in earnest to bind the bargain or in part payment , or some note or memorandum in writing of the same bargain be made and signed by the parties to be charged or their agents whereunto lawfully authorized . Like the fourth section , this section has been adopted by most of the states . The amount , however , varies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only those of $200 or more . The average may be said to be $50 and over . The question also arises as to whether goods in the process of manufacture are considered as goods , wares , or merchandise or whether contracts involving them are for work or services . In this respect the states differ widely . Some of the states hold that , if at the time of delivery the transaction involves a sale of goods , wares , or merchandise , it is within the statute . In New York , if the article is in existence at the time of the transaction , it is within the statute ; in Massachusetts , if the article is in existence or is the kind of article the seller ordinarily makes in the course of his business , whether in existence or not at the time of the transaction , it is within the statute . Example : Smith , a young engineer , traveling for a large electrical-supply house , had just succeeded in obtaining a verbal agreement with Brown for an order amounting to over $1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the factory requesting immediate delivery . When the goods were delivered , Brown had changed his mind and refused to accept them . Smith would be powerless to force acceptance , under the seventeenth section of the Statute of Frauds , unless he could produce evidence in writing , signed by Brown , of the transaction . REVIEW PROBLEMS 1 . X contracted orally with Y , sales manager of the Z Refrigerator Company , to sell refrigerators at $150 each until the supply of 500 was exhausted . The salary was to be $300 a month and expenses . Three months after X started work and before all the refrigerators were sold , Y discharged X. X sued , and Y set up the defense that the contract came under the fourth section of the Statute of Frauds as requiring more than a year to complete . The trial judge ruled in favor of Y.

After 6 months he was discharged . If X is to be successful in a suit for breach of contract , what must he produce and why ? 9 . X , a salesman , received an oral order for 100 desk lamps from Y.

Y agreed orally with X for the latter to make a complete set of ornamental hardware for Y 's new home . Y was to furnish all the drawings and specifications for the hardware . The bill amounted to $200 . X had completed part of the work when Y ordered him to stop and refused to pay the balance . When sued , Y set up the defense that the order came under the Statute of Frauds . Was the defense good ? Why ?  | DISCHARGE In the preceding discussion have been outlined first the methods by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second the essentials that make this agreement binding . We now consider the methods by which these parties may discharge such an agreement , i.e. , the means by which the parties may free themselves from any liabilities which they may have created by their contract . There are a number of ways in which this may be done , some of which may operate without the knowledge of one or all of the parties . The methods by which a contract may be discharged and the parties freed from their liabilities and rights thereunto may be divided into two groups , ( 1 ) by the acts of one or all of the parties and ( 2 ) by operation of law . Before considering these methods in detail , it will be well to remind the reader of the underlying principle of common law that governs the contractual relations of individuals . Broadly , this says that one may make a contract but that one does not have to carry it out , for , if one chooses , one may pay damages . Money paid in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is conceivable that a contractor who is losing heavily on a certain structure might prefer to pay damages for breach of contract rather than continue with the work . If , on the other hand , damages are obviously inadequate or unjust or are doubtful in extent or if it is impossible fully to ascertain their value , the equitable remedy of specific performance may be had from a court of equity . Such cases are rare except in the sale of lands , where specific performance is frequently granted . I. DISCHARGE BY THE ACTS OF THE PARTIES Under this head we have ( 1 ) performance , which may be a complete performance , a substantial performance , or impossibility of performance ; ( 2 ) mutual agreement ; ( 3 ) expressed waiver ; and ( 4 ) breach of agreement . 1 . Performance . a . Complete Performance . The normal and natural way for a contract to be discharged is by complete and satisfactory performance , which means that each party fulfills his part of the contract to the satisfaction of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 208  | commerce this is a fairly easy matter to determine , but in the complicated , involved contracts met in engineering it is not always so simple . A contractor may conscientiously and honestly attempt to fulfill all his obligations and yet fail in some minor or semi-important detail . To hold him strictly to performance would be a great injustice , since the structure that he has created is of value and of service to the owner even if the roof happens to be an inch or two lower than specified . Since complicated engineering structures , involving perhaps several stages of development and often more than one contractor , make complete and satisfactory performance difficult , there has developed the concept called substantial performance . b . Substantial Performance . Substantial performance is a very technical subject at law , and frequently there arises a great difficulty in determining the rights of the parties involved . Logically , it would seem to be simple . Let us suppose that a contractor completes a certain structure and is willing to admit that he has not fulfilled all his obligations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equity . By what is known as the quantum meruit principle , which means " as much as the party deserved , " he can recover the cost of the work completed , but the owner may receive credit for that part which did not come up to specifications . The difficulty , of course , is to determine the relative values of the parts completed and uncompleted and an equitable adjustment of damages to the owner and of cost to the contractor . These cases frequently involve long and complicated legal controversies . Returning , now , to the common-law ruling on the discharge of contracts , which applies equally well to engineering contracts , we find that , to constitute performance , the terms of the contract must be carried out as to time , place , and conditions . Example : Smith and Company contracted to drill a gas well of a certain depth and diameter for Brown . Smith and Company drove the well to the required depth , hut part of it was of a smaller diameter . The excuse was that this would save time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the larger one would have been It was held that this was not a compliance . Gillespie Tool Co. v. Wilson ( 123 Pa. 19 ) . When a contract calls for the payment of money , there is a question of whether or not a check or note in payment thereof discharges the contract . 1 t is clear that the first party need not accept a note or check ; but if he does accept it , the states differ as to its effect upon the contract . Some hold that a check or note is conditional payment , and others that either constitutes payment if accepted . A difficult question also arises where a contract stipulates that the subject matter shall he t , o the complete satisfaction of one of the parties . The question is : " Can the whims , o1iosyncrasies , and personal tastes of  | one of the parties prevent the fulfillment of the contract by the other when , for all intents and purposes , the contract has been fulfilled ? " The answer seems to be that , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , automobiles , and pictures , where the parties can not be put in state quo , the contract will be strictly enforced . But for impersonal goods , such as buildings or machinery , the courts hold that a man must be satisfied when in reason and justice he should be . Examples : 1 . Smith , a tailor , made Brown a suit of clothes under the agreement that the clothes were to be satisfactory to Brown . Smith made and delivered the suit to Brown , who declined to accept it . In an action to recover the price of the suit , Smith showed that the suit could be made to satisfy Brown . It was held that Brown was the sole judge . It was Smith 's fault if he entered into such a contract . Brown v. Foster ( 113 Mass. 136 ) . 2 . Smith contracted with Brown to install a heating system in Brown 's factory . Said heating system was to be satisfactory to Brown ; if it was not satisfactory , Smith was to remove it at his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept it , claiming that it was unsatisfactory . It was held that the question of satisfaction was to be determined not by Brown but by the judgment of a disinterested third party . Hawkins v. Graham ( 149 Mass. 284 ) . c . Impossibility of Performance . It has already been demonstrated that , when the thing to be done is impossible on the face of it , no contract exists . We are now to consider what happens when the impossibility arises subsequent to the formation of the contract . The general rule is that such contingencies do not excuse performance unless there has been included in the contract a clause that makes the promise conditional upon such unforeseen events as fire , flood , or strikes . Example : Smith contracted to deliver to Brown a certain number of bushels of beans . After delivering about one-third the number , Smith refused to deliver more , claiming that an early and unusual frost had destroyed his crop . It was held that lids did not excuse his performance , for , when such causes are likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract . Anderson v. May ( 50 Minn. 280 ) . There are , however , certain events that may come to pass after the formation of a contract and that the courts will recognize as sufficient to discharge the contract . These are ( 1 ) a change in the existing law , ( 2 ) destruction , through no fault of either party , of some material thing the continued existence of which is essential to the fulfillment of the contract , ( 3 ) the death or sickness of the promisor in a contract for personal services , and ( 4 ) the occurrence of a situation where conditions essential to performance do not exist . Examples : 1 . Smith leased a wooden building from Brown . The agreement stated that , if the building should burn , Brown was to rebuild it . After the building had been occupied for a few years , it burned . About , this time the city passed on ordinntaco prohibiting the erection of wooden buildings within a certain aura , which included  | the site of the said building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contract would be unlawful , Brown was released . Cordes v. Miller ( 39 Mich. 581 ) . 2 . Smith agreed to lath and plaster Brown 's house . After he had partly completed the job , the house burned . It was held that Smith was released from fulfilling the remainder of his obligations and could collect for what he had done . Cleary v. Sohier ( 120 Mass. 210 ) . 3 . Smith , who was a manager for a troupe of actors , contracted with Brown , the manager of a theater , for a certain number of performances . The troupe , however , did not appear , for the leader , the principal singer , was taken ill . It was shown that the success of the act depended upon the chief performer . It was held that this was a good excuse , for it depended on circumstances beyond the leader 's control . Spaulding v. Rosa ( 71 N.Y . 40 ) . d . Tender of Performance . It sometimes happens that one of the parties makes an offer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuses to accept it . This is called tender of performance and may , under certain conditions , discharge the tenderer from all responsibility and lay the other party open to a suit for damages . Contracts for personal services will ordinarily be discharged by a tender to perform by the promisor . In engineering contracts , failure to procure a building site or building permit in time for a contractor who offers to start building the structure will often release the contractor and make the owner liable for damages . In the case of the payment of a debt , a tender will release the debtor from paying any cost in a suit against him for the debt . Particularly in the case of a payment of a debt , the exact amount must be offered to the creditor in person , without any reservations , request for a receipt , possibly excepted . In all these cases the tender must be actual , formal , and unconditional . 2 . Mutual Agreements . If a contract is wholly executory , the parties may make a new contract to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waive his rights under the old contract , and the waiver of one is the consideration of the other . This agreement must have all the essentials of the contract . If one of the parties has partly or wholly performed , then his offer to release the other party must be supported by a consideration . There is , however , one exception to the rule , viz. , a contract involving a third party , such as one where a suretyship is included . 3 . Expressed Waiver . Some contracts contain clauses that automati3cally waive the rights of one or the other party or even provide for their discharge . Insurance policies often contain clauses that waive the rights of the insured if he should engage in a dangerous occupation without notice . Other examples are clauses releasing the parties from contingencies such as strikes , floods , fire , etc. 4 . Breach . We have already discussed breach , the alternative to carrying out the terms of the contract . When a contract is breached ,  | there immediately arises a new set of obligations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breach , and the party injured acquires a new right known as a right of action . The ways in which a breach may occur are three , ( 1 ) by renouncing liability , ( 2 ) by an act making it impossible to fulfill the contract , and ( 3 ) by failure to perform in part or in whole . a . Renouncing Liability . If , in an executory contract , one party renounces his liability prior to the time performance is due , i.e. , declares he does not intend to perform when the time comes , the contract is breached and the injured party may immediately start action for damages . If one party partly performs and then refuses to continue , the injured party need not wait until the time of completion arrives before starting an action . In fact , he must not wait if waiting would increase the damages . Examples : 1 . Smith contracted with Brown to deliver to Brown a certain quantity of iron at a specified time . Before the time arrived , Brown notified Smith that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron . It was held that Smith was justified in considering the contract broken and that it was not necessary for Smith to tender delivery or wait the specified time before bringing an action for damages . Windmuller v. Pope ( 107 N.Y . 674 ) . 2 . Smith brought a number of pictures to Brown 's shop to be repaired and cleaned . Brown had commenced work when Smith notified him to stop , for he had decided not to have the work done . Brown , however , continued and then sued Smith for the entire amount of the contract . It was held that Brown was not justified in thus increasing the damages . He was entitled only to the actual damage sustained when the contract was breached . Clark v. Marsiglia ( 1 N.Y . 317 ) . b . Acts Creating Impossibility of Performance . If one of the parties , through some act of his own , puts it out of his power to perform the contract , the other party may consider the contract breached and may bring immediate action for damages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or has been performed in part . Example : Smith entered into a written contract with Brown by which Smith was to pay Brown a certain sum of money on the condition that certain mines owned by Smith paid a profit . Before the mines were worked , Smith sold them . It wan held that , by rendering the condition impossible , the note became absolute , and that Smith was liable for the whole amount . Wolf v. Marsh ( 54 Cal . 228 ) . c . Failure to Perform . When one party fails entirely to perform his part of a contract , the contract is breached . But a question arises , in cases where goods are to be delivered in installments and paid for at differ- , ent times , as to whether such contracts are to be considered divisible or not . The consensus in this country favors taking into account ; the intent of the parties to the contract , and such a contract ; ' vill not be considered divisible unless it is the intent of the parties that such is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown for 5,000 tons of steel to be shipped at the rate of about 1,000 tons a month . Brown shipped 400 tons the first month and 885 tons the second . Smith then refused to accept any more and to pay for what was shipped . He attempted to set aside the whole contract on the grounds that Brown had breached his contract . It was held that this contract was entire and not divisible and therefore that Smith could rescind the whole contract . Norrington v. Wright ( 115 U.S. 188 ) . II . DISCHARGE BY OPERATION OF LAW The ways in which the law itself provides for the discharge of a contract are ( 1 ) merger , ( 2 ) alteration , ( 3 ) bankruptcy , and ( 4 ) statute of limitations . 1 . Merger . When one party breaches his contract and a suit is brought and a judgment obtained , the parties no longer have any liabilities under the contract . They are said to be merged into the judgment . In a similar manner , when a contract of higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferior security , the former is said to have been merged into the latter . Example : Smith , the owner of some land , contracted for its sale , reserving the right to remove some timber thereon during a specified time . Before the time had expired , he conveyed the land by deed under seal but forgot to make the reservation of the timber . It was held that the former contract was merged into the deed and that the title to the timber passed with the deed . Clifton v. Jackson Iron Co. ( 74 Mich. 183 ) . 2 . Alteration . Alteration of a contract is very essential to the engineer , for frequently it is desirable to change either the specifications or the contract for an engineering structure or both . The best way to handle changes of this character is , of course , to provide for such changes in the contract and then to adhere to the method there set forth . Where there is no such provision and where an alteration is made in a material part of a written instrument by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with knowledge of B and without the knowledge of the first party A , and with the intent to defraud , there can be no recovery on the original consideration . If the alteration is made without intent to defraud , there can be a recovery on the original instrument . Examples : 1 . Smith and Brown made and signed a promissory note and endorsed it to Allen . In this note " September " had been struck out , and " October " put in its place . The change was made after Smith had signed the note as surety , without his knowledge or consent . It was held that this was a material change and relieved Smith of his liability . Wood v. Steele ( 6 U.S. 80 ) . N 2 . The substitution of the words " with interest " in a promissory note without the knowledge or consent of one of the parties , but without intent to defraud , was held not to invalidate the original note . Owen v. Hall ( 70 Md. 97 ) . 3 . Bankruptcy . Since 1898 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . This law provides among other things that , when  | a bankrupt has been discharged from his bankruptcy by a United States court , he is released from all liabilities under any contract made prior to his bankruptcy . 4 . The Statute of Limitations . In general , the law of the place where the contract is to be carried out governs the construction of the contract . If no specific place is mentioned for carrying out the contract , then the law of the place where the contract is made governs . Finally , if suit is brought on the contract , the law of the place where suit is brought governs . Every state has enacted what is called a statute of limitations , which stipulates a certain time limit within which action for breach of contract must be brought ; beyond this period it is outlawed , and no recovery can be had . The length of time allowed varies in different states and with different types of contracts . Typical examples are open accounts , 6 years ; written instruments , 10 years ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . The time begins to run from the day the injured would be entitled to bring suit or claim . Under the statute , the time begins on the day on which the injured party is entitled to bring suit for the claim , unless the defendant is out of the state , in which case most of the states postpone the running of the statute until his return . Also , if the defendant is incapacitated , as by being a minor , insane , or in prison at the time when the statute would normally begin to run , it is postponed till such incapacity is removed .

On the back of the note had been written by Z , " Interest paid to date and time extended 6 months from date . " X contended that this constituted an alteration and released X from liability . Decide the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which enormous enterprises are carried on from one home office or center by one man or a group of men , has made it essential that there be a scheme of organization by which other people may act for and in the place of the parent organization or individual . The whole structure of the so-called modern " big business " is based upon the fundamental concept that one man can act for and in the place of another . Since the engineering graduate frequently finds himself in one of the above capacities , it is essential that he become acquainted with and appreciate some of the fundamental legal aspects surrounding this relationship . For example , an engineer acting for his company impliedly warrants in his contract of employment that he possesses that skill and diligence customarily possessed by those who profess the same act or calling . His primary responsibility is to adhere faithfully to specifications and instructions given him . If he fails to fulfill his duties , exceeds them , or disregards them , he may be personally liable for any loss suffered by his employer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal , employs another , called the agent , to do some act or acts for his ( the principal 's ) benefit , there has been created a legal relationship known as an agency . A person dealing with the agent is known as the third party . If the agent is authorized to and does employ one or more assistants , these assistants are called subagents. 2 . Basis of the Law of Agency . The law of agency is fundamentally a continuation of the law of contracts , to which has been coupled the law of torts . It is based upon two fundamental concepts , viz. : ( 1 ) A person may act for and in the place of another . ( 2 ) A person who acts by or through another acts for himself . Thus an agency may be created for any lawful act or business , except such acts as by their inherent nature must be done in person or those acts which by law must be done in person . An example of the former is marriage ; examples of the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretion , such as those of the judge of a court . 3 . Classification of Agents . Agents are usually classified as general and special . A general agent is one who has been authorized to carry on 216  | all his principal 's business in a given locality or all his principal 's business of a certain kind . A special agent is one who is employed for a specific purpose , to do some particular act or acts and no more . It will be noticed that the distinction is one of degree and not of kind . The general agent has been given authority of a general nature . A person dealing with such an agent would be safe in inferring that he has the authority customarily conferred upon such agents ; for even if this agent has private instructions to the contrary , the principal is bound if the agent has apparent authority and acts within the scope of his agency . But , in the case of a special agent , the party dealing with him would naturally conclude that the agent had only limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Qualifications of Principal and of Agent . Any person capable of making an enforceable contract may be a principal , and any person , except a lunatic , imbecile , or child of tender years , may be an agent . Thus it is not necessary that the agent be of age , only that he be not extremely young or insane . 5 . Creation of the Relationship of Agency . An agency may be formed in four ways . The first , and usual , method is by agreement or contract ; the second is by ratification ; the third , by estoppel ; the fourth , by necessity . a . By Agreement . This is an agency by contract , and all the rules previously outlined concerning contracts also govern the relations between an agent and a principal , except in the case of a gratuitous agent . The latter case will be discussed later . This agreement may be either written or oral ; but when , by the terms of the agency , it is not to be performed within one year , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , when the agent is required to enter into sealed contracts with third parties , the authority creating the agency must also be under seal . Example : Smith made an oral agreement with Brown , by which Brown was to operate Smith 's grist mill for one year from Apr. 1 , next . After working a few months , Brown was discharged . It was held that this case was clearly within the Statute of Frauds and could not be enforced . Hinckley v. Southgate ( 11 Vt. 428 ) . b . By Ratification . A person without any authority to do so may act for another , or an agent may act for his principal in excess of his authority . I f in either case the principal assents to the act , an agency is said to have yeen created by ratification . However , the ratification , to be binding , it ust be unconditional , with a knowledge of all the material facts and without misunderstanding or misrepresentation . This ratification may be by expressed words or by accepting the benefits , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reject the remainder . If he ratifies at all , he must ratify as a whole ; and if he rejects , he must do so  | within a reasonable time after he hears of the act , or it will be presumed that he has ratified it . Example : Smith , who was a friend of Brown 's and knew that Brown was a dealer in secondhand furniture , purchased a quantity of furniture in Brown 's name , without Brown 's knowledge or consent . Later Brown was pleased with Smith 's purchase and ratified Smith 's act , thereby creating an agency . c . By Estoppel . The principle of estoppel at law is a barrier which the law creates to prevent a man from proving that a fact is different from what he previously represented it to be . Thus , if a man represents another to be his agent , authorized to act for him in a certain respect , or knowingly and without dissent has allowed another to act in such capacity , or by his previous dealings in that respect has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusively presume such a person to be his lawful agent to the extent necessary to protect third parties . Example : Smith represented to Brown that Allen in St. Louis was his duly authorized agent to act for him in his business transactions in that city . Brown negotiated with Allen for the purchase of a stock of electric motors that Brown had on hand . Smith was dissatisfied with the transactions that Allen had made and claimed that Allen was not his agent . The doctrine of estoppel would prevent Smith from using this defense , since Brown had relied upon Smith 's representation . d . By Necessity . There are a few cases in which an agency will be created by the operation of law . When certain parties , by virtue of their relationship , make it necessary that the relation of principal and agent exist , the law will so presume . The two principal illustrations of such cases are as follows : ( 1 ) The wife may pledge her husband 's credit for the necessities of the home . ( 2 ) A shipmaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel . A case of compulsory agency was held in the action of Benjamin v. Dockham ( 134 Mass. 418 ) , in which plaintiff sued defendant for the price of milk furnished to defendant 's wife . 6 . Obligations of Principal to Agent . A principal owes three duties to his agent : 1 . To compensate him in accordance with the terms of their contract , or , if no contract was made , then to pay him a reasonable compensation for his services . 2 . To reimburse him for his advances and expenses properly and reasonably incurred for and on behalf of his principal . 3 . To repay him any damages which he was compelled to pay because of his doing an act , at the direction of the principal , which act was not manifestly illegal or known by the agent to be illegal . Such payment is called indemnity . '  | Examples : 1 . Smith agreed to act as Brown 's agent for a certain time at a certain salary . After the time had expired , Smith continued to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's salary . It was held that Smith could recover at the original rate . Wallace v. Floyd ( 29 Pa. 184 ) . 2 . Smith , a broker , purchased some bonds for Brown upon Brown 's request . Several years later Brown ordered Smith to sell the bonds . It was then learned that some of the bonds had been canceled . It was held that Smith could recover the loss , as the loss fell on Brown , if Smith acted in good faith . Maitland v. Martin ( 86 Pa. 120 ) . 7 . Obligations of Agent to Principal . An agent owes six duties to his principal : 1 . He must obediently carry out the directions of his principal , so long as those directions do not ask him manifestly to violate the law . 2 . He must use the utmost good faith toward his principal . An agent must be careful not to place himself so that his own interests will come into conflict with those of his principal . 3 . He must possess and exercise the skill and diligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must keep and render faithful and accurate accounts of all property coming to him in the course of his agency . He must keep the funds of his principal separate from his own . 5 . He must give timely notice to his principal of all facts coming to his knowledge , a reasonable time before , or at any time during the course of the agency , which relate to the subject matter of the agency , if such facts are necessary for the principal to know to safeguard his interests . 6 . He must act in person . He can not delegate the performance of any duty requiring discretion to another person unless his principal has expressly or impliedly authorized him to do so . He may delegate the performance of purely mechanical acts.2 8 . Liabilities of Agent to Principal . 1 . When an agent fails to obey instructions and a loss ensues , he is personally liable for damages . Example : Smith and Company received a draft for collection with instructions to return it at once if not collected . They failed to present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meantime the drawee became insolvent . Held that Smith and Company was liable . Whitney v. Merchants ' Union Exp . Co. ( 104 Mass. 152 ) . 2 . An agent can not make a profit for himself at his principal 's expense . Example : Smith employed Brown to buy a certain automobile for $500 or as much less as he could ; Brown was to receive $5 for his trouble . Brown purchased the automobile for $450 and returned no part of the $50 . In this case Smith could recover the difference . Bunker v. Mills ( 30 Me. 431 ) . 3 . An agent must exercise the skill and prudence customarily used by careful men in a similar business and under like circumstances .  | Example : Smith was employed by Brown to loan money on mortgages . Smith loaned money on realty already heavily mortgaged , and Brown lost . Held Smith was liable for his principal 's loss . Whitney v. Martine ( 88 N.Y . 535 ) . 4 . If an agent is authorized to appoint another agent for his principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally liable for the acts of the second agent ; but when he appoints a subagent , he is personally liable for the subagent 's acts as if they were his own . IIe may appoint subagents for purely mechanical or ministerial duties . Example : Smith employed Brown to examine a piece of land , fix a fair price for it , and sell it . After examining the land and fixing the price , Brown commissioned Allen to find a purchaser . The law would not forbid the appointment of such a subagent , for no discretion was needed in the exercise of his act . Renwick v. Bancroft ( 56 Iowa 527 ) . 5 . If the agent is gratuitous , he can not be held for performance , for there is no consideration to support the agreement ; but if the gratuitous agent actually enters upon the discharge of the agency , then he must exercise skill and care in what he does just as a paid agent must . Examples : 1 . Smith and Brown jointly owned a vessel . Smith volunteered to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vessel was lost , and Brown sued Smith for damages . It was held that Brown could not recover , as Smith was a gratuitous agent . Thorne v. Deas ( 4 N.Y . 84 ) . 2 . Smith volunteered to invest some money for Brown . He invested the money in worthless securities , and Brown lost . It was held that Brown could recover , for a gratuitous agent must use the skill customarily used by reasonable men in similar circumstances . Williams v. Higgins ( 30 Md. 404 ) . 9 . Obligations of Principal to Third Parties . Principals are of two kinds , disclosed and undisclosed . Disclosed principals may be named or unnamed . If an agent is dealing with a third party and advises that party that he is an agent , the principal is said to be disclosed . If the agent actually names the principal , he is said to be a named principal . However , if an agent makes a contract with a third party apparently in his own name , when in fact he is acting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The following rules apply to both disclosed and undisclosed principals : 1 . The principal is liable on all lawful contracts entered into by his agent with third parties if the agent is acting within the actual or apparent scope of his authority . 2 . The principal is liable for the unauthorized acts of his agent that he later ratifies. 3 . The principal is bound by any notice to the agent , even if the agent fails to inform the principal  | 4 . The principal is liable for the frauds , misrepresentations , or negligence of the agent in the course of his employment and for the principal 's benefit , even if he does not command or ratify them . 5 . The principal is liable for the crimes of his agent if he expressly commands them or if they are of the nature of violating police regulations , such as a speed or traffic regulation . Example : Smith , without Brown 's knowledge or authorization , delivered a load of coal for Brown to Allen and in the process broke a plate-glass window belonging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown presented a bill to Allen for the coal . It was held that , by ratifying the act in presenting the bill , Brown was liable for the damage of his agent . Dempsey v. Chambers ( 154 Mass. 330 ) . 10 . Obligations of Third Party to Principal . The third party is liable to the principal in the following cases : 1 . For all contracts entered into with the agent within the actual or apparent authority of the agency . 2 . For all contracts subsequently ratified by the principal . 3 . For any property or moneys obtained from the agent under fraud or duress . 4 . For any deal with the agent to injure the principal . 5 . For unlawful interference with the agent in the execution of his agency . Example : Smith maliciously caused the arrest of Brown , an engineer , while Brown was running his train . The result and delay of the train caused the railway company to suffer loss . It was held that the railway company could recover damages from Smith . Railway Co. v. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Agent to Third Parties . An agent is liable to third parties in the following ways : 1 . If the principal is undisclosed or does not exist and if the agent contracts in his own name , the agent is personally liable . 2 . If he exceeds the actual or apparent authority of his agency , he may be held personally by the third party for damages , although he is not liable on a contract in the principal 's name . 3 . In some cases the agent may be personally held for his torts against third parties . 12 . Termination of the Relationship of Agency . An agency may be terminated by the acts of the parties and by operation of law . a . Termination by the Acts of the Parties . The parties may themselves terminate the agency in any one of the following ways : ( 1 ) by stipulating : t time limit in the original contract creating the agency ; ( 2 ) by performing the thing or things for which the agency was created ; ( 3 ) by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 ) by renouncing of the agency by the agent .  | In general , either the principal or the agent has the power to terminate the agency but not always the right to do so . The principal can generally discharge his agent with or without cause , but he may have to pay damages if he exercises this power wrongfully . In like manner , the agent can always renounce his agency ; but if he does so without just cause , he too will have to answer for damages . Such revocation is binding only on those third parties who have received notice of it . Example : Smith employed Brown as his agent to purchase a certain piece of land . Brown purchased the land , paid the first payment , and received his compensation . Later Brown bought the land in a tax sale . It was held that the agency was terminated with the completion of the first deal and that the principal could not hold the agent on the second . Moore v. Stone ( 40 Iowa 259 ) . When an agency is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the power to revoke the agency . An agency is said to be coupled with an interest when the agent has an interest in the subject matter by way of security . Example : Smith , a cabinetmaker , owed Brown a sum of money secured by a note . Smith went abroad and gave Brown entire control of his property with power to sell the furniture or stock and apply the proceeds on the note . Brown continued the business for a while , when Smith died . It was held that this was an agency coupled with an interest and that therefore it did not terminate with the principal 's death . Knapp v. Alvord ( 10 N.Y . 205 ) . b . Termination by Operation of Law . The law may operate to terminate the agency through ( 1 ) a change in the subject matter of the agency or ( 2 ) a change in the condition of the parties . 1 . DESTRUCTION OF THE SUBJECT MATTER . If the subject matter is destroyed , the agency is terminated ; but if the act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to answer for damages . Example : Smith employed Brown to find a purchaser for his automobile . Before Brown found the purchaser , the car was wrecked and destroyed . This would terminate the agency . 2 . CHANGE IN THE CONDITION OF THE PARTIES . If either the principal or the agent dies , the agency is terminated , and no notice to third parties is required . Example : Smith appointed Brown his agent to collect rents . Later Smith died , unknown to Brown . It was held that an agent 's power to collect rents ceased with his principal 's death , unless coupled with an interest , and that any rents collected thereafter were not binding upon the estate , even if made in ignorance . Farmers Loan and Trust Co. v. Wilson ( 139 N.Y . 284 ) . If either the principal or the agent becomes insane , the agency is terminated , but notice must be given to third parties in this case , unless the agent has been legally declared insane .  | An agent 's imprisonment or his prolonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general , anything else that incapacitates the agent .

( e ) X appoints his wife to help entertain the ladies in the group and charges to Y the cost of an evening dress for Mrs. X. 17 . X is an engineer and the agent of Y Company . The agreement creating the agency is legally correct in all particulars . He is instructed to pay up to but not in excess of $500,000 for all the land necessary on a certain watershed to enable the company to build a dam and hydroelectric plant of a certain capacity .

Are agreements entered into by these agents binding upon X Company ? Why ? 19 . X , living 10 miles from town , asks his neighbor Y to bring back a distributor cap for his tractor . Y agrees to do this but forgets all about it . X suffers material damage by the delay and sues Y. Decide the case . 20 . Suppose , in Prob . 19 , that Y had bought the cap and had broken it by careless handling on the way home , would this have made any difference to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies came into existence and grew in importance as an aid to individuals and corporations in their business transactions , so commercial paper gradually came to be used as a substitute for money . The first business transaction was undoubtedly a barter or exchange . Smith had a cow that Brown wanted , and Brown had a horse that Smith wanted . They effected an exchange that was mutually satisfactory and thereby completed a business transaction without money . Later , but before the advent of money as we know it , common commodities were no doubt used as a standard of value ? for example , wheat . Smith wanted Brown 's bow and arrows . He offered Brown 10 bushels of wheat for them . Brown took the wheat and exchanged 5 bushels for a fire-making device and 5 bushels more for a bearskin . Later still , the use of metallic money as a common medium of exchange and measure of value in a trade was more satisfactory , for it did not fluctuate so greatly in value . As civilization became more highly commercialized , the element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send money to distant places , to say nothing of the danger of loss . As an example , suppose Smith in New York wished to buy a carload of oranges from Brown in California . He would first wire or write for a quotation on a carload lot . Brown would wire or write his reply , and Smith , if satisfied with the price , would then order the oranges . Now let us suppose further that Allen in California owed Smith in New York a sum of money as a result of another transaction . Smith , instead of sending the money from New York to Brown in California , might direct Allen to turn over to Brown the necessary payment for the oranges , upon Smith 's agreement to credit Allen 's account with that amount . This method of paying Brown saved the time , expense , and risk incurred if Allen had sent the money to New York and Smith had sent it back to Brown . An order of this kind from one party to another , directing payment to a third party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange have become quite popular in business dealings with parties in different states or different countries . As faith and confidence grew among businessmen , other forms of written instruments were developed to expedite business , such as promissory notes and checks , until today such written instruments pass almost 225  | as freely as actual money . Just as the use of these instruments developed and grew out of the customs of merchants , so the law concerning them developed and grew . This development culminated in the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law drafted by John J. Crawford of the New York bar , which has been adopted by all the states of the Union . Thus many of the old common-law rulings concerning negotiable instruments have been modified or rescinded by legislation enactment . This chapter will be devoted to a consideration of this law . I. NEGOTIABILITY 1 . Definition . A negotiable instrument is essentially a contract acknowledging a debt , with the added feature that it may be transferred from one person to another by endorsement and delivery or by delivery only , so that the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . As previously stated , the principal forms of negotiable instrument are promissory notes , bills of exchange , and bank checks . In general , anyone who can legally contract can make negotiable paper . 2 . Holder in Due Course . In the case of negotiable instruments the one who has a clear title to such an instrument is said to be a holder in due course . The Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law declares that a holder is the one who has possession of the instrument and that a holder in due course is one to whom it has been negotiated . However , the interpretation by the courts of the above definition is much more complicated . Among other things a holder in due course must : 1 . Be sure the instrument is complete and regular upon its face , i.e. , with no obvious omissions or defects that would render it nonnegotiable. 2 . Pay value for the instrument . 3 . Take the instrument in good faith . 4 . Acquire it before maturity . 3 . Essentials for Negotiability . Although custom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed , the law itself does not require any exact form . However , it does demand that a written instrument must fulfill the following essential requirements if it is to be negotiable : 1 . It must be in writing . 2 . It must be properly signed . 3 . It must be negotiable in form . 4 . It must be payable in money only , and the amount payable must be definite and certain . 5 . The amount must be payable absolutely and unconditionally . 6 . The payment is to be made to the order of some designated person or bearer .  | 7 . Money is to be paid on demand or at a designated time , which time must be sure to arrive . a . A Negotiable Instrument Must Be Written . The first requirement is obvious . No oral contract could be negotiable , i.e. , transferable from one party to another . Writing here includes printing and may be by any legitimate means , such as ink or pencil . The entire instrument must be written , including all essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keep a record , such as paper , parchment , cardboard , or plastic . b . A Negotiable Instrument Must Be Signed by the Party Making It . The signature is usually affixed to the end of the instrument , but this is not essential , if it is clearly shown that the name , wherever placed , was intended for a signature . If the maker can not write his name , his " mark " is sufficient . Even if the maker can write but chooses instead to make a mark or designate some other character as a signature , he will be bound by it Brown v. Butchers ' &; Drovers ' Bank ( 6 N.Y . 443 ) . In fact , Sec. 19 of the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law gives great freedom in the form the signature may take . For example , a fictitious or trade name may be used . The name of the maker may be placed on the instrument by an agent , treasurer , or cashier , but if these people would protect themselves , the signature should clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be Negotiable in Form . The intent of the maker of a negotiable instrument to make it negotiable must be actually expressed . This is customarily done by making the instrument payable to order or bearer . If made to some particular person or persons , it is a simple contract and is not negotiable . Although Sec. 1 of the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law provides that an instrument to be negotiable " must be payable to order or bearer , " these precise words are not necessary . Such words as to holder , to assignee , to any one he designates , or even the expression " this note is and should be negotiable " may suffice . As an example , the following instrument is not negotiable : West Lafayette , Ind . Apr. 15 , 19. $500.00 Six months after date I promise to pay to John Smith five hundred and no/100 dollars . Value received . John Brown If the words " or order " were inserted after " John Smith , " the above instrument would have been negotiable . ( ) r if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name " John Smith , " the instrument would have  | been negotiable . The words " value received " are not essential . They were originally used to indicate the consideration required in simple contracts . Even the date is not essential to negotiability . An erroneous date or postdating , unless done for the purpose of defrauding someone , is immaterial . d . A Negotiable Instrument Must Be Payable by a Sum Certain in Money . The amount to be paid must be definite and certain , viz. , a given sum or a given sum with interest . If it depends upon a contingency that may or may not arise or if it depends upon a value of something not definitely known , it is not negotiable . Thus a note " payable to the Protection Insurance Company , or order , for $271.25 , with such additional premium as may arise on policy No. 50 , issued at the Calais Agency " is not negotiable Dodge v. Emerson ( 34 Me. 96 ) . At common law , if an instrument specifies a reduction in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time , the instrument is nonnegotiable . However , the majority of the courts and the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law take the opposite view , providing the amount of discount is specifically stated . The law even goes further and states that a provision to pay a fixed sum and collection costs or lawyer fees in case of protest will not render the instrument nonnegotiable even if the costs and fees are not certain . Not only must the amount be definite and certain , but it must be paid in money . The value of any other commodity would not be definite . By money is meant legal tender . An instrument payable in a foreign currency is of doubtful negotiability in the United States . Some courts hold that , if a provision for calculating the rate of exchange is included , its value can be ascertained and therefore it is negotiable . " Legal tender " is money that the law requires a creditor to accept in payment of an undisputed debt . Silver coins of a dollar or more are legal tender in any amount . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in amounts not exceeding $10 . Nickels and pennies are legal tender in amount not exceeding 25 cents . Paper money is not , strictly speaking , legal tender , except for United States treasury notes ; nevertheless , it is accepted everywhere . Counterfeit money can always be returned and good money demanded . In other words , if one were to pay a debt with counterfeit money , either knowingly or unknowingly , the creditor , upon discovery thereof , may demand good money . e . In a Negotiable Instrument the Amount Must Be Payable Absolutely . A negotiable instrument may specify a place of payment , but it must not , impose a condition that would render it of no effect . Thus a promise to pay a certain sum out of a particular fund only is not negotiable , even if the fund was in existence at the time the condition was made Richardson v. Carpenter ( 46 N.Y . 660 ) . Likewise , a promise to pay out of the pro-  | ceeds of a sale or if an enterprise makes a profit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 4 N.Y . 159 ) . However , the instruments may specify a particular fund to which the amount is to be charged . Although a negotiable instrument may not contain a collateral undertaking and be negotiable , it can contain an alternative to a sum certain in money and still be negotiable ; as an example , a note containing an absolute promise to pay $1,000 or 10 shares of A Company stock is negotiable . f . In a Negotiable Instrument the Person to Whom the Money Is to Be Paid Must Be Designated . An instrument to be negotiable must be payable to a certain person or his order or to the bearer . There must be no uncertainty as to the person to whom the money is to be paid . This is the common-law ruling . The Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law has made a literal interpretation of a designated payee necessary . Thus if the instrument says " Pay to the order of ? " and if no name is inserted in the blank space , it is , for all practical purposes , payable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Whether it is filled in with an actual name , a fictitious name , bearer , holder , or possessor is immaterial . Even a check made out to " cash " is construed to be made out to bearer . The Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law even provides for the statements , " Pay to the holder of an office for the time being , to an administrator , to an agent , to a collector , or to an estate . " Contrary to common-law rulings the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law provides for payment to a plurality of payees such as A , B , or C , on the grounds that , when the instrument is endorsed by one of the payees , the payee is designated and the instrument becomes negotiable from then on . g . The Time of Payment Must Be Definite and Fixed . The law requires that the time of payment must be sure to arrive . Thus an instrument made payable after death is negotiable Shaw v. Camp ( 160 Ill. 425 ) , but an instrument made payable at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time is not certain to arrive . This holds even if the payee is twenty-one as the action on the instrument begins Kelly v. Hemmingway ( 13 Ill. 604 ) . II . PROMISSORY NOTES 1 . Definition . A promissory note is an unconditional written promise by one or more parties to pay to bearer or to another person or his order a ' ' sum certain in money at a specified time . The party who makes the promise is called the maker , or promissor , and the party to whom the promise is made is called the promissee , or payee . Negotiable instruments of any kind are of two types , called bearer instruments and order instruments .  | An example of an order type of promissory note is as follows : West Lafayette , Ind . Apr. 15 , 19-$500.00 Six months after date , I promise to pay John Smith , or order , the sum of five hundred and no/100 dollars with interest at 6 per cent per annum . Value received . John Brown The maker of this note is John Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If in place of the name John Smith the word " bearer " had been used , the instrument would be of the bearer type . 2 . Signatures . When an agent signs a note for his principal , he may bind himself . It depends upon how the signature is executed . Thus , John Smith by Tom Brown , Agent ; Tom Brown , agent for John Smith ; John Smith , by his agent , Tom Brown ; Tom Brown for John Smith ; or John Smith , by Tom Brown , are all signatures by agents that bind the principal only Long v. Colburn ( 11 Mass. 97 ) . However , if the agent signs in any of the following ways , he alone is bound : Tom Brown , Agent ; Tom Brown , President of the Utility Electric Light Company ; Tom Brown , agent of John Smith ; Tom Brown , Treasurer McClellan v. Robe ( 93 Ind . 298 ) . Other forms of signatures are given different interpretations by the courts . Some hold only the principal liable ; others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them jointly bound . Occasionally , some forms of signatures are said to be ambiguous , and evidence is allowed to explain them . 3 . Endorsement and Delivery . If the payee , John Smith , in the above note , wishes to obtain the money before the note is due , he may sell it to another . Since this is an order instrument , he would do so by endorsement and delivery . An endorsement is a written directive by the holder in due course to pay the amount of money due on it to a specified person or to bearer . Endorsements are of two kinds , special and in blank . If John Smith wished to make a special endorsement , he would write on the note " Pay to the order of Jack White , " sign his name , and hand the paper to Jack White . John Smith now becomes the endorser and Jack White the endorsee . Assuming that Jack White paid approximately $500 for the note , he becomes a holder in due course . If John Smith had wished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed his name on the back . By this process he converts an order instrument into a bearer instrument , and whoever he gives it to for value becomes the holder in due course . Other types of endorsements may be made , such as restrictive , qualified , conditional , or irregular . Some of them may stop further negotiation , for example , endorsing a check to the First National Bank " for  | deposit to my account . " Others affect the rights and liabilities of subsequent endorsers. 4 . Discharge . The promise of a promissor is absolute and can be discharged only by payment at or after maturity or by some of the means by which a contract may be discharged . The promissor is the party of primary liability . All endorsers are parties of secondary liability . In general , acts of omission may discharge parties of secondary liability but not the party of primary liability . On the other hand , anything that discharges the instrument discharges all parties . The obvious way to discharge the instrument is for the party having primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Section 88 of the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law states that " payment is made in due course when it is made at or after maturity of the instrument to the holder thereof in good faith and without notice that his title is defective . " Payment before maturity by the promissor does not discharge the instrument . If an instrument that has been paid before maturity subsequently gets into the hands of a holder in due course , the party of primary liability will have to pay it again . The Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law also provides that presentment for payment is to be made at the maker 's principal place of business or , if he has none , then at his residence , but at a reasonable time of day . A reasonable time would be during business hours of a business day . Other means of cancellation of a negotiable instrument are : 1 . Intentional cancellation or destruction by the holder . 2 . Absolute and unconditional renunciation by the holder . 3 . Alteration . At common law a material alteration in the instrument discharged it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible on the original instrument by a holder in due course who is not a party to the alteration . 4 . Statutes of limitation . III . BILLS OF EXCHANGE 1 . Definition . A bill of exchange , or draft , is an unconditional written order from one person ( called the drawer ) to another ( called the drawee ) to pay to a third person ( called the payee ) or his order a certain sum in money at a specified time . Bills of exchange are either foreign or inland . They are foreign if drawn in one state or country and payable in another state or country ; they are inland if drawn and payable in the same state . They are also classified ) as time and sight drafts . A sight draft is payable on presentation , while a time draft is one payable at a given time after demand ; sight , or ( late . One use of the bill of exchange has already been illustrated . Another common one is the so-called bank draft , in which the  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt with a creditor in a different locality by such an instrument . Also business houses frequently employ the bill of exchange in order to collect a debt in a different locality , naming a bank as payee . An example of a bill of exchange is the following : West Lafayette , Ind . Apr. 15 , 19-$500.00 Ten days after date , pay to John Smith , or order , the sum of five hundred and no/100 dollars , value received , and charge same to my account . John Brown To John Allen Indianapolis , Ind . In this inland bill of exchange John Brown is the drawer , John Allen is the drawee , and John Smith the payee. 2 . Acceptance . A bill of exchange , being an order on the drawee , is not binding on him until it has been presented for acceptance and has been duly accepted by him . If , in the above bill of exchange , John Allen wishes to do as requested , he will write across the face of the note , " Accepted Apr. 17 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of acceptance by the drawee , the drawer is liable to the payee , for he virtually says , " If the drawee does not pay you , I will " ; but as soon as the drawee accepts the bill , the drawer is released by that act . In Cook v. Baldwin ( 120 Mass. 317 ) it was held that the words , " I take notice of the above , Henry Baldwin , " written on a bill of exchange , were not necessarily an acceptance , but in Nat . Park Bank v. Ninth Nat . Bank ( 46 N.Y . 77 ) it was held that the acceptance by the drawee of a draft that had been forged as to the drawer 's name was nevertheless binding upon the acceptor . A draft that does not specify a definite date of payment must , be presented for payment within a reasonable time . In Chambers v. Hill ( 20 Tex . 472 ) it was held that two years and nine months was unreasonable , but in Wallace v. Agry ( 4 U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the drawee refuses to accept the bill , it is said to be dishonored . IV . CHECKS 1 . Definition . A check is a bill of exchange drawn on a bank and payable on sight or demand . figure  | It will be seen that the above check is really a bill of exchange , or draft , upon a bank in which John Brown is the drawer , the Purdue State Bank the drawee , and John Smith the payee . A check differs from a bill of exchange in that it is always payable upon demand . 2 . Acceptance . As in the case of a bill of exchange , if the bank refuses to accept the check , the drawer is liable , since a check is an implied contract that the drawer had money on deposit in the bank . In the case of a check , a reasonable time for presentation is much shorter than in the case of a bill of exchange . The general opinion is that any time within 24 hours after receipt is a reasonable time Grange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more specific , if the parties to a check reside in the same locality , the check must be presented for payment at some time before close of banking hours on the next business day following its issue . If the parties reside in different localities , a check must be started back for presentment on the next business day after it is received . Failure to present a check for payment within a reasonable time will relieve all endorsers of their liability , and also the drawer to the extent that he has suffered loss by the delay . 3 . Certified Checks . It is obvious from the preceding discussion that anyone accepting a check does so on faith faith that the drawer actually has the money on deposit which he says he has . For this reason , checks are not ordinarily fully accepted unless the party is known . Where the parties are unknown , certified checks are often used . A certified check is one on the face of which the bank has written the word " certified " and affixed a signature . The bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts it into a separate account with which to meet the payment later . REVIEW PROBLEMS In Probs. 1 to 4 are the written instruments negotiable ?

Before the law of sales can be discussed , it is necessary to have an understanding of what is meant by the term " property " in a legal sense and to be able to distinguish between the various kinds of property with which individuals deal . The term " property " in its broadest legal sense includes , first , any object tangible or intangible that is capable of exclusive possession and , second , the right to use , enjoy , and dispose of such an object . In this sense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or incorporeal , tangible or intangible , visible or invisible , real or personal , choses* in action or in possession , as well as any other thing that has exchangeable value or that makes up one 's wealth or estate . The term property , then , includes nearly everything which exists on earth with the exception of such things as the air man breathes , the sunlight in which he warms himself , and the ocean in which he bathes . However , if man bottles air or sea water in a container that belongs to him and keeps it there , it becomes his property . For the purpose of this discussion , one classification of property out of the many that might be given will suffice , viz. , real and personal property . Furthermore , the scope of this chapter will not permit discussion of real and personal property in more than the first meaning of the term given above . The rights arising out of , and the interest in , such property must of necessity be left to extended treatises on fundamental economics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other objects that are attached or that , by reason of their mass , are assumed to be attached to the land . Personal property , also called chattels , is in general anything else not attached to real property or that which can be removed from real property without damage to the real property . Although the distinction between real and personal property is simple basically , it is far more difficult to analyze in practice . What does or does not pass from one owner to another with the realty is of importance and is often in dispute between landlord and tenant , mortgagor and mortgagee , vendor and vendee . In this respect the courts frequently apply certain tests . First is the intention of the party footnote ' Derived iruiu thr French word rhoae , tnraning " thing . " 235  | annexing the chattel to the land . This may be inferred from the nature of the article , the relation of the party to the owner , the method of attaching the chattel , and the purpose for which it was attached . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a stove set in the usual way is personal property , but a built-in icebox recessed in the wall or masonry would become part of the realty , even if installed by the tenant . The third test concerns the purpose for which the chattel was installed ; in the case of business establishments , this is a most involved question . Such chattels are called fixtures and frequently must pass with the realty . However , there are cases on record in which bowling alleys were considered personal property and therefore removable . On the other hand , there are cases in which certain types of machines installed in factories were considered parts of the realty . Leases , however , are personal property . Just because a thing can be removed does not necessarily make it personal property . Fencing on a farm , for instance , is part of the realty . Finally , a tenant must remember to remove all chattels that are not considered fixtures before the expiration of his occupancy , for he can not subsequently reenter and claim them . 2 . Title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied to the instrument or document by which an individual 's right to possess or own a piece of land was proved . It has been loosely applied to personal property as the means by which an individual has just and legal right to possession of such property . Title to personal property may be acquired by ( 1 ) gift , ( 2 ) sale , ( 3 ) chattel mortgage , ( 4 ) conditional sale , or ( 5 ) security for a debt . The remainder of this chapter will deal principally with method 2 , the sale , as applied to personal property other than money . In this respect , provisions of the Uniform Sales Law will be followed closely . . 3 . Sale and Sales Agreements Defined . 1 . An agreement to sell goods is a contract by which one individual , called the seller or vendor , agrees to transfer the property in goods to a second individual , called the buyer or vendee , for a consideration , called the price . 2 . A sale of goods is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the buyer for a consideration called the price . 3 . A contract to sell or a sale may be absolute or conditional . In the above definitions , " goods " includes all personal property except choses in action and money . By contract or agreement is meant a valid contract . Therefore , all the essentials and rules discussed in the preceding chapters of this text concerning the making of a valid contract apply to a sale and agreements to sell . Capacity to buy and sell is the same as capacity to contract and includes the ability of certain otherwise incompetent persons to buy necessaries.  | Price , as herein considered , involves money . If the consideration were other than money , the transaction would be a barter and not a sale . In general , however , the same rules would apply to barter as to sale , except in the case of an agency . Even though an agent is empowered to sell , he may not be empowered to barter . If no consideration is given , the transaction is a gift and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Distinction should also be made between goods transferred for a special purpose and later to be returned , either in the same form or in a different form , and goods transferred permanently . The former is a bailment , while the latter is a sale or barter . Thus , wheat to be ground into flour and logs to be sawed into lumber are bailments , provided that the flour and lumber are returned to the original owners of the wheat and logs , respectively . The important point is that in a sale the title passes to the buyer , while in a bailment it ordinarily does not . However , a difficult question arises where confusion of goods takes place . Thus a warehouse proprietor , storing grain in a common bin , confuses A 's grain with B 's and obviously can return only in kind ? not the identical grain furnished by A. If , in the meantime , the grain elevator burns down , the determination of whether or not title has passed establishes upon whom the loss shall fall . The consensus seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the warehouseman . Distinction should also be made between a sale and goods pledged to secure a debt . In this case title does not pass until the debt is defaulted . Moreover , a chattel mortgage is not a sale . Although the title to goods actually passes in this case , which thus differs from a pledge , the transfer is negatived upon performance by the mortgagor of the conditions of his mortgage and must be retrans'erred upon the payment of the mortgage . Finally , a commission merchant or an agent created to sell goods may operate under consignment of goods ; in this case the title does not pass , and the transaction is not a sale . Sometimes , the agreement rendered in which such persons operate is an actual sale agreement , but often it is not . In such cases the intent , not the language of the agreement , seems to govern the interpretation put upon it . 4 . Form of Contract or Sale . Any form that will make a valid contract is legal . Thus written agreements , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfactory , provided that they conform to the Statute of Frauds . In the case of the seventeenth section of that statute , the amount above which the agreement must be in writing has been raised in some states to $500. 5 . What Title Passes . The general rule is that a seller can give no better title to the article he sells than he himself possesses . Thus a thief can not give a good title to goods he has stolen , and the buyer , no matter  | how innocent he may be , can not obtain a valid title to the goods . There are three exceptions to this general rule , however . 1 . The first exception is in the case of negotiable instruments . Because such instruments have the character of money , it is for the best interest of the community that they circulate freely . Thus a person who buys , for value , a promissory note , payable to bearer , before maturity , is an innocent purchaser and acquires a good title to the note even though the person selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . The principle of estoppel will operate to prevent an actual owner from reclaiming goods sold by one whom he himself has invested with the apparent ownership . 3 . An agent may sell goods , with which the title passes , for his principal within the scope of his agency even though he himself has no title whatsoever to the goods . 6 . When Title Passes . The question as to whether a title has or has not passed is probably the most important one in the law of sales . Upon the answer to this question depend the liability for loss or damage to the goods and the type of action taken by the plaintiff in court procedures . Thus , if the title has not passed , he sues the buyer for breach of contract ; if the title has passed , he must sue for the price . It is clear that in an actual sale the goods must be in existence and ascertainable and in a deliverable state . But in an agreement to sell , the goods may not be in existence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or may not be ascertainable though in existence , or may not be in a deliverable state ; or the agreement to sell may be conditioned upon some test or other thing to be done to the goods before they are in a deliverable state . The first rule is that the title passes when the parties intend that it should be transferred , this intent to be inferred from the terms of the agreement , the conduct of the parties , and the circumstances of the case . If the intent is not ascertainable or is in doubt , then the time of passing of the title depends upon the state of the goods involved as follows : a . For Ascertainable Goods in a Deliverable State . For an unconditional contract for the sale of ascertainable goods in a deliverable state , the title passes at the time when the contract is made , whether or not delivery has actually taken place or the price has been paid . Example : In Dexter v. Norton ( 47 N.Y . 62 ) defendant agreed to deliver to plaint itTy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a specified price . After about half the number of bales called for had been delivered , a fire destroyed t-he remainder . No negligence was established against defendant . The court held that , , since the title passed at the time the agreement was made , the defendant was excused from further delivery . But if various things had still to be ( lone by the vendor , title would not have passed and the vendor would be liable for breach of contract to sell . b.  | c . For Goods Not in a Deliverable State . When the agreement involves ascertainable goods to which the vendor has yet to do something to put them in a deliverable state , the title does not pass until this is done . Example : If A sells B a secondhand car but agrees to overhaul the motor before delivering the car to B , the title will not pass to B until A completes the overhaul . d . For Goods When the Price Is Not Fixed . When the agreement concerns ascertainable goods in a deliverable state but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform some other act in order to fix the price , title will not pass until this is done . However , there is considerable court opinion that the necessity for weighing or measuring simply for the sake of fixing the price is not so significant as to overcome the presumption that title passes immediately upon completion of the contract . Since , however , the Uniform Sales Law omitted any mention of this rule , the presumption is that title passes , even though the goods are to be weighed or measured for the purpose of fixing the price . The following case follows the older common-law ruling . Example : In Fitch v. Beach ( 15 N.Y . 221 ) there was an agreement involving a boatload of lumber , the exact amount and quality of which were not known . It was necessary to obtain an inspector to measure and sort the lumber . Before the inspector could be obtained , the boat sailed away . The court held that title had not passed and that the vendee could recover damages only for breach of agreement and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goods with Option of Returning . When goods are delivered to a buyer with an option of returning them within a specified time , the title passes immediately but is subject to being retransferred to the vendor if the goods are returned within the specified time . Example : A sold B a book with the understanding that , if B did not like the book , he could return it within 15 days . Before the 15 days were up , B lost the book . In this case A would have the right to sue B for the price of the book . f . For Goods on Approval . When goods are delivered to a buyer on approval , the title does not pass until the buyer signifies his approval . Example : If A sells B a book on approval for 15 days and the book is stolen on the tenth day , A is the loser ; but if B sold the book to C on the tenth day , his act would be taken as an approval and B would have to pay A for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and ( e ) is the legal difference of the interpretation of the words " option " and " approval . " In a given case , unless the word option or approval is actually used , the intent would have to govern in deciding whether or not title had actually passed . g . For ( roods Not Ascertainable . Where the goods are not ascertainable , the title does not pass to t he buyer tint it the goods are ascertained .  | Example : If A agrees to manufacture 10 motors to meet certain specifications for B , B does not have title to the motors until they are manufactured . If in the above example B had gone to A 's factory and examined and approved the motors , then the title would immediately pass to B and any subsequent damage to them would fall upon B. It should be noticed that merely completing the manufacture of the goods is not in itself sufficient to pass title unless coupled with an act , called an act of appropriation . Such an act might be notifying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill of lading , delivering , or tender of delivery . As an example , Black in Indianapolis orders miscellaneous goods from White in New York . White selects the goods according to Black 's specification , packages them , addresses them , executes a bill of lading , and delivers them to a common carrier , such as the mails , trucking company , express company , railroad , steamship line , etc . Under some conditions any of these acts might be considered an act of appropriation , but the general opinion is that the last one , viz. , delivery to the common carrier , is the instant at which title passes . Either party may specify when title shall pass , and when this is done , it takes precedence over all general rules . In general , when goods are sold F.O.B. ( free on board ) , title passes when the goods are " on board " the common carrier . The same is true for goods sold C.O.D . ( collect on delivery ) . 7 . Common Carriers . A common carrier is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all who apply for such services . Carriers may limit themselves to carry only certain types of goods . Furniture movers , for example , may limit what they will carry to household goods and refuse livestock , pets , or people . A pipe-line company limits its business to gas , water , or oil , or any one of these . Although public-service commissions may require a carrier to obtain suitable equipment in some instances , a carrier is not generally required to carry goods for which he does not have suitable equipment . Finally , a carrier is not required to carry goods that are dangerous iii themselves , contraband in the eyes of the law , or stolen ; and it may , if it desires , collect the shipping charges in advance . In general , the common carrier is an insurer of the goods entrusted to it for transportation , but there are some exceptions : 1 . A common carrier is not responsible for what the law calls acts of God , such as unprecedented floods , earthquakes , lightning , hurricanes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combustion , is another matter , since fire is commonly attributed to acts of man . On the other hand , an act of God , to be an excuse , must be the sole reason that the goods were damaged . 2.  | 3 . A common carrier is not liable for interference or damage done by an enemy of the country . In general , petty robbers and " highjackers " are exempted . 4 . The common carrier is not liable if he can show that the damage to goods was caused by the shipper . Improper packaging or crating might be such a cause . 5 . Unless he expressly provides otherwise , a common carrier is not liable for goods which in themselves deteriorate , for example , perishable goods shipped with their nature unknown and whose nature reasonable diligence would not determine . On the other hand , if perishables which were kept in refrigerator cars spoiled because of failure of the refrigerating medium , the carrier would be liable . 6 . To a limited extent a common carrier may limit his liability by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old common law , and therefore the validity of such agreements is a matter for the court to decide . 8 . The Bill of Lading . The bill of lading is a written instrument , issued by the common carrier to the shipper , which states the terms of the contract of shipment . It performs three distinct functions : 1 . It acts as a shipping receipt . 2 . It is a document of title . 3 . If properly executed , it may function as a negotiable instrument for the purpose of procuring credit . However , a straight bill of lading not executed as an order instrument is not negotiable . It could be used as security for obtaining credit , nevertheless . If the seller procures an order bill of lading to his own order or to the order of an agent , the presumption is that he wishes to retain title in his own name until actual delivery to the vendee . If the buyer has given specific shipping instructions , title does not pass , in general , until these instructions are complied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause title to pass for the portion shipped , unless and until the buyer signifies his desire to acquire title to the lesser portion , as by accepting delivery and retaining the goods . 9 . Conditions and Warranties . A condition in a contract to sell or in a sale is a stipulation , expressed or implied , the fulfillment of which may be treated as essential to the passing of title to the goods in question . Upon failure to meet such a condition the injured party may consider the agreement broken , or he may waive the condition . If the seller has promised that a condition will happen or be performed , the buyer may treat the nonperformance of such a condition as a breach of warranty . Airy affirmation of fact or any promise by the seller relating to the goods is an express warranty if the natural tendency of such affirmation or promise is to induce the buyer to purchase the goods and if the buyer purchases the goods relying thereon .  | In Higgins v. Delaware G. ( 60 N.Y . 553 ) vendor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the agreement that vendee was to remove the coal in a specified time and that , if the vendee failed to do so , the vendor might discontinue delivery and keep the earnest money paid . The buyer failed to call for the coal , although the seller had the coal and was ready at any time to deliver it . The judge held that the above stipulation was a condition the observance of which was essential if the buyer wished to hold the seller to the delivery of the coal . In the above case the particular type of condition involved is called a condition precedent . In older cases it was called a dependent promise . In other words , the promise of the seller to deliver the coal was dependent upon the buyer 's coming and getting it by the time specified . It seems that , when such a promise as the above is considered not dependent but independent , then failure to comply is a breach of warranty as defined above and gives rise to a right of action for damages but , in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The question as to whether a given promise or stipulation is a condition precedent or a warranty depends upon the intention of the parties . In general , any promise made by a seller concerning the goods in the contract is a warranty , but in America a warranty is given a restricted meaning by having attached to it the independent meaning referred to above . To be a warranty , such a promise must be made to induce the buyer to buy , and the buyer must rely on the promise . Some jurisdictions also include the requirement of intent on the part of the seller . A warranty should be distinguished from an affirmation as to the value of the goods or any statement that is merely an opinion of the seller . Warranties , like conditions , are expressed and implied . They are expressed if the statement is expressly made and are implied if deduced by law from the nature of the sale or condition of the parties . An implied warranty must of necessity be included in the agreement , but an expressed warranty may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be enforced when so added , it must be supported by a separate consideration . Also , it must not be inferred that a warranty is an essential eleme ! i l in a sale or an agreement to sell . Warranties are generally referred to as collateral promises . No particular word form is required to create a warranty . 10 . Implied Warranties . The following are implied warranties : a . Implied Warranty of Title . The seller makes an implied warranty that he has the right to sell the goods in question . The seller makes an implied warranty that the buyer shall have and enjoy quiet possession of the goods . The seller makes an implied warranty that the buyer shall he free from encumbrances with third parties .  | In Long v. Hickingbottom ( 28 Miss . 772 ) it was held that , when a seller sells a chattel the possession of which is in the hands of a third party and there is no covenant of warranty , the buyer buys at his own risk , but if the seller is in possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price as his own , he warrants the title . b . Implied Warranty in Sale by Description . The seller makes an implied warranty in selling by description that the goods shall correspond with the description . c . Implied Warranty by Sample . The seller makes an implied warranty in selling by sample that the bulk will correspond to the sample , that the buyer will have an opportunity to compare the bulk with the sample , and that , if the seller is a dealer in such goods , the goods will be free from defects . Graff v. Foster ( 67 Mo . 512 ) was a case involving the sale of fruit by sample . The buyer claimed that the bulk was far inferior to the samples that plaintiff had exhibited . It was held that it was not necessary that the word warranty be actually used but that it was sufficient that the seller had undertaken to furnish goods as represented by the samples . In Day v. Raguet ( 14 Minn. 273 ) it was held that specifying goods to be 10 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample . d . Implied Warranty of Quality . When the buyer makes known to the seller the purpose for which the goods are desired and when it appears that the buyer has relied on the seller 's skill or judgment , there is an implied warranty that the goods will be reasonably suitable for such purpose . On the other hand , if the buyer has examined the goods beforehand , there can be no implied warranty against defects that could be detected by such inspection ; and if a specified article is sold under its patent or other trade name , there can be no implied warranty of its suitability for any particular purpose . In Tabor v. Peters ( 74 Ala. 90 ) it was held that the manufacturer of a special device , himself the seller , must be held to have warranted the goods he sold as being useful and reasonably suitable for the purpose intended ; that , if they were proved to be worthless , there was a breach of implied warranty to that effect ; and that this constituted a good defense against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gould ( 86 Ill. 180 ) it was held that the delivery of wet , dirty grain for clean , white grain was a breach of an implied warranty that the grain was merchantable . Also in Rogers v. Niles ( 11 Ohio 48 ) defendant had agreed to furnish plaintiff at a future date with steam boilers with which to run his engines in his mill . Latent defects arose that rendered the boilers unfit for the purpose intended . It was held that there was an implied warranty on  | the part of the seller against defects in material or workmanship , whether latent or otherwise . In this connection there arises an involved problem when the terms of contract to sell stipulate that the goods shall be satisfactory to the buyer . As stated in Chap . 20 , whether or not such a statement becomes a condition precedent depends on the nature of the goods . If the goods are of the nature of personal clothing , there is no doubt that such a stipulation would be considered a condition precedent . But where the contract involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operative fitness or mechanical utility , the intent is the deciding factor , and no invariable rule can be laid down . A similar case exists where goods are sold conditionally upon their arrival by some designated means of transportation , such as a particular vessel before a specified time . Here there is a double condition precedent , first that the vessel shall arrive and second that the goods shall be on board when the vessel does arrive . Note , however , that the seller promises , not that the goods shall arrive , but that the obligation of the agreement is conditioned upon their arrival . Of course , a seller may warrant only that the goods are on board or that goods will arrive at a specified time without designating a specific train , car , or boat . 11 . Performance of Contract . In general , it is the duty of the seller to deliver the goods and of the buyer to accept and pay for them in accordance with the terms of the contract of sale . Unless otherwise stated , delivery and payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the parties show readiness and willingness , the one to deliver and the other to pay . Actual tender is not essential to support an action . As to time , place , and manner of delivery , two cases arise . If a particular time or place or manner of delivery has been specified , that time or place or manner of delivery must be adhered to ; but if no particular time or place or manner of delivery has been specified or implied , then the time is a reasonable time ; the place is the seller 's place of business , or his residence if he has no place of business ; and the manner depends upon the place and present holder of the goods . Delivery may be effected in any way that satisfies the Statute of Frauds , or the seller may notify the buyer and hold the goods as the buyer 's bailee ; when the buyer is the bailee of the seller prior to the sale , he may continue to hold the goods on his own behalf ; when a third person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seller , he may continue as bailee for the buyer ; finally , the goods may not be in the custody of anyone , as in the case of goods lying at a public freight house or wharf . The seller is not bound to take the goods to the buyer . It is necessary only that he make it , possible for the buyer  | to come and get them . Where delivery is actual , it must , in general , be made at a reasonable hour . 12 . Delivery of Wrong Quantity of Goods . If the seller delivers more goods than called for , the buyer may accept those called for and reject the balance ; if it causes too much trouble and expense to separate them , then he may reject the whole amount ; he may accept the whole amount provided that he pays for the whole amount at the contract price . The same rule applies when the goods are mixed with other goods not called for . If the seller delivers fewer goods than called for , the buyer may reject them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knowing that the seller does not intend to furnish the balance , he must pay the contract price for what he did accept ; if he was ignorant that the balance was not forthcoming and had disposed of what goods were sent , then he need pay only what they were worth to him . When delivery is to be made by installments , the rulings depend so closely upon the exact terms of the agreement that no general rules can be laid down , except that , where no specific stipulation is made , a buyer need not accept goods in installments . When goods are delivered to a common carrier for delivery to the buyer , whether the carrier is designated by the buyer or not , it is deemed a delivery . Finally , when goods that he has not previously seen are sent to a buyer , he is not deemed to have accepted them unless and until he has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect them . In this connection a buyer is deemed to have accepted the goods when he so intimates to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is inconsistent with the ownership of the seller , or if , after a reasonable time , he detains the goods . If the buyer has the right to reject the goods and does so , he is not bound to return them . It is sufficient that he notify the seller that he has rejected the goods . However , if the buyer does not take the delivery within a reasonable time after being notified by the seller that the latter is ready and willing to make delivery and requests that the buyer take delivery , the buyer must answer for any damages resulting therefrom to the seller as well as for a reasonable charge for the care of the goods 13. - Rights of Unpaid Seller against the Goods . Whenever the whole price for goods has not been paid by a buyer or when a negotiable instrument received as payment is dishonored , the seller is designated as an unpaid seller and acquires certain rights in the goods , even though title has passed to the buyer . 1 . If the yowls are still in his possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to retain them . 2 . In the case of insolvency of the buyer , he has the right to stop the goods in transitu after lie has parted with the possession of them .
