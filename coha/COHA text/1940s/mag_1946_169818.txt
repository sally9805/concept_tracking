Britons thought things were getting a little better . Taxis stood on the streets waiting for customers . Bomb-damaged houses were being repaired . Only a month ago pudgy Food Minister Sir Ben Smith told housewives that this year food conditions would improve ; Sir Ben even let them have little Christmas extras as an earnest of better days to come . <P> Then , out of London 's grey February sky , the blows fell . Sir Ben did not " know where to lay my hands on " the $100 million needed for dried-egg imports . Then publicity-shy Sir Ben , a former cabby , meeting the press for the first time in many months , said that the world food crisis ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) had made still further cuts necessary . Because India was exporting fewer ground nuts and Antarctic whaling results were disappointing , the ration of cooking fat was to be reduced to seven ounces a week ( former ration : eight ounces ) . Because imports of fodder were reduced , there would soon be less bacon , less poultry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per person a month ) . Bread might again be rationed too . " Not one grain more " of barley would go to the distillers ; whiskey would be scarcer than ever , and Sir Ben was " sorry about that . " <P> Seven months after the end of the war , their new rations seemed , to many Britons , worse than war itself . Said one suburbanite , standing in the queue before the butcher 's shop : " There 's been more moaning over this than over the buzz bombs . " <P> No More Dunkirks . Britain 's Labor Government heard the moaning , promptly ordered up Churchillian propaganda guns to drown the noise . Prime Minister Attlee appointed a three-man Cabinet committee to plan the strategy for " the Battle of the Bread . " Minister of Agriculture Tom Williams launched a new " Dig for Victory " campaign . Lord Aberconway , president of the Royal Horticultural Society , announced that his members would continue to resist the temptation to reconvert to flowers . Pert Minister of Education Ellen Wilkinson appealed to Britons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The slogans did not take . Britons have had Dunkirk . They were tired of battles , tired of digging for victory , tired of their drab , tasteless meals . They understood that Britain had to contribute food to the needy in Europe ( 1 million tons since the end of the war ) , money to UNRRA ( $320 millions already given , $320 millions more promised ) . They did not understand why the Treasury could not have allotted to dried eggs the $80 millions it allowed last year for purchase of Hollywood films . ( Angry housewives cried : " We do n't want Frank Sinatra . We want food . " ) Still less did they understand why their Labor Government had been less frank with them than Tory Churchill had been in wartime . Belatedly conscious of the need to take democracy into his confidence , Sir Ben Smith now warned : there was no guarantee that the situation would not get worse .
