txt GAS ' RATION MARE 16 GALLONS A MONTH IN NEW OPA ORDER Motorists Will Get 48 Coupons for 4 Gallons Each to Last for a Year From July 22 RIGID CONTROLS PROVIDED La Guardia and Other Mayors Plead for Midwest Rationing to Ease East 's Shortage By CHARLES E. EGAN Special to THE NEW Yoas TIMES . WASHINGTON , June 26 ? Sixteen gallons of gasoline a month , or a total of 192 gallons to cover a full year 's driving , will be allowed motorists holding basic " A " cards under the permanent rationing plan announced today by the Office of Price Administration . Almost at the same time that this action was being taken , Mayor La Guardia of New York and the Mayors of cities in other Atlantic States appealed to Secretary Ickes and , separately , to the House Banking Committee , for " moderate " gasoline rationing in several Midwestern States as a means of freeing transportation facilities to allow increased shipments of oil to the East . Joseph B. Eastman , transportation chief , attended Mr. Ickes 's conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the East the " A " ration books to be issued to motorists would contain forty-eight coupons , with each having a - unit value of four gallons , but the unit value might fluctuate in accordance with shipping developments , the OPA said . Giving details of the permanent program , the OPA added that in order to qualify for supplemental allowances of gasoline the automobile owner must prove that his occupational driving was in excess of 1,800 miles annually . A second requirement for supplemental allowances will be proof thaf- the applicant has formed a " Car-Sharing Club " to drive three or more persons other than himself to and from work , or proof that he can not carry the required number in his car but is carrying as many as he can . Time Element Is Established Under the program , which supersedes the " emergency " system under which gasoline has been rationed to motorists since May 15 , motorists will be required to register at public schools for their " A " ration books on July 9 , 10 or 11 . A time element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new arrangement . Each " A " book will contain six pages of eight coupons to each page . Each eight coupons will represent a twomonth supply of gasoline and can be used for a two-month period only . Thus , the coupons on Page 1 will be valid from July 22 to Sept. 22 , those on Page 2 for the ensuing two months , etc . The government agency has figured that on a basis of fifteen miles to the gallon the basic " A " ration book will provide sufficient gasoline for 2,880 miles of driving a year . Of this total , according to OPA , 1,800 miles will be considered available for occupational use , while the remaining 1,080 miles will be considered available for general purposes such as the driving necessary to attend church , to take children to and from school and for shopping . Motorists who believe they can qualify for supplemental gasoline allotments through a " B " or " C " book are advised to ask for application blanks for the supplemental rations when they register for their basic books in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , will issue only the basic " A " books to motorists and- the special " D " books containing basic allowances for motorcyclists . Applications for additional gasoline allowances under the new requirements must be filed with the local rationing boards , either in person or by mail . While the local boards , which will pass on the requests for added allowances , will receive applications beginning July 9 , OPA officials said that the applications need not necessarily be filed before July 22 , when the plan goes into effect . Holders of " A " books can use the first eight coupons in their " A " books while the process of getting supplemental rations is under way . The local rationing boards have received specific instructions not only on considering applications for supplemental rations but also in issuing rations for types of users other than those in the " A , " " B , " " C , " and " D " groups . Such types include trucks , taxis , buses , hearses , ambulances , rental vehicles and government cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and non-highway uses ( boats , farm machinery , etc. ) , for which " E " and " R " books will be issued . The " B " book of sixteen coupons may be issued to an applicant who shows that his occupational driving exceeds the 150 miles a month provided by his " A " book . This " B " book must last for a period of three months , thus giving the applicant an estimated 320 miles of additional driving a month . Thus a total of 470 miles a month are possible for occupational driving under the plan . But an applicant who can show that he needs more than the " A " book , but less than the full amount of the " B " book , will have his supplemental ration book " tailored " by extending the expiration date of the book beyond the threemonth minimum . A " B " book might be made to last four months , or five months , or six months , or a year . Local boards will be provided with tables determining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed in the application . Before issuing a " C " book a local board must see that the applicant 's needs can not be met by an " A " book or an " A " book plus a " B " book . In other words , his occupational driving must exceed 470 miles a month . He must also have met all the requirements for a " B " book , and , in addition , must belong to a category of users recognized as essential to the war effort and to the public welfare . Services for which " C " books may be issued include medical care , maintenance of public utilities , the transporting of farm labor , the giving of religious comfort or assistance , and official trips on government business . The " C " book will be issued for three-month periods . While a full book will contain ninety-six coupons , the board will tear out coupons to " tailor " each book issued to fit the applicant 's needs  --  More than one " C " book may be issued if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards by OPA outlines the procedures to be followed by State OPA directors , local custodians of forms and documents connected with the plan , county and city superintendents of schools responsible for setting up organizations for . registering motorists , school administrators and members of local war price and rationing boards . The plan , which in many respects resemble the procedure set up for sugar rationing , requires that all motorists after July 22 surrender a coupon when purchasing gasoline . These will form the basis of a rigid audit system controlling all movements of gasoline . " From the user , " the OPA handbook explains , " the coupons will flow to dealer and to intermediate distributors . Then , while the coupons themselves may be exchanged at a War Price and Rationing Board for exchange certificates , control forms will proceed through the licensed distributor and State administrator to the fuel rationing division of OPA . " Thus at every step of the mar- , keting and distribution process , the flow of gasoline will be controlled by the provisions of the rationing plan .
