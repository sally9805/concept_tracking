txt In a very fundamental sense it is inaccurate to describe President Truman 's declaration that the United States should support " free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation " as expressing a new American foreign policy . It is true that the proposed aid to Gteece and Turkey represents an enlarged commitment for the United States . It is true that undertaking this commitment greatly broadens America 's role in securing the peace . But aid to Greece and Turkey for the purpose of resisting conquest by force is the very opposite of new American foreign policy . Its roots reach deeply into traditional American action . To pursue any different course would be to break with traditional American policy . A A A There need be no doubt that events have posed a Momentous decision for the United States , not because Anierican foreign policy is changing but because the world is changing has already changed . In reason , in purpose , in effect what President Truman said to Congress on March 12 , 1947 , was what President Monroe said to Congress on Dec. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Monroe Doctrine of 1823 . It rests upon and it parallels the Monroe Doctrine . Those who ? wish to oppose aid to Greece and Turkey as a means of support . for ? " free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation " can say this is a vast extension of the Monroe Doctrine , because the Monroe Doctrine was only intended to resist the " attempted subjugation " of the Western Hemisphere . It is nearer the truth , though , to say that the Monroe Doctrine has remained unaltered In the President 's new declaration , that the world has so contracted that the " attempted subjugation " of Greece and Turkey in 1947 is as great a threat to the ? safety of the United States ' as the " attempted subjugation " of any Western Hemisphere republic in 1823 . This is why the Truman Doc- trine is the Monroe Doctrine modernly applied . It is tra-. ditional American doctrine abreast the times . ' A. A A Expressive ' of the continuity of Anierican thought and reaction , it is almost startling to remind ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine of the inviolability of free peoples in the Western Hemisphere ? he took specific note Of the then distant struggle toward Greek independence ? After Portrait by Peale James Monroe and this at a time when trans-Atlantic . travel was a matter of weeks instead of hours . " A strong hope , " he reported to Congress , " has long been . entertained , founded on the heroic struggle of the Greeks , that they would succeed in their contest and resume their equal station among the nations of ? the earth . It is believed that the whole civilized world take a deep interes ? in ' their welfare , " The struggle is not distant today . Greece and Turkey are on the shores of the Western Hemisphere . If their independence is to be lost by subjugation , then force which endangers our ? own freedom is in the making . A A It is altogether useful that ? there is a wide agreement on what die Government 's aidto-free-peoples policy really . means . The difference is that the evils which its opponents ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , in the ' judgment of its supporters , its real Virtues : Its opponents say they are against aid to Greece and Turkey , because it means carrying the Monroe Doctrine to the Mediterranean : because it is equivalent to peacetime Lend-Lease . A A A Its supporters are for aid to Greece and Turkey , because they believe the Monroe Doctrine must be tarried to the Mediterranean  --  to the frontier of free peoples ; because they believe that unless freedom is defended where it is at stake , a chain of events will be set in motion which will make its defense neater home vastly more costly , ? vastly more perilous . The Monroe Doctrine in the WeStern Hemisphere has not operated as an instrument of aggression nor as an instrument of imperialism . It has been utilized by d " free , people to help secure freedom . The Truman-Monroe Doctrine embodies the same fundamental to accomplish the same purpose . It is a modern fulfillment of traditional American policy carried out on a scale which the times demand .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
