A chemical that makes cattle bleed to death , Dicumarol , is now saving human lives . If a man takes Dicumarol capsules before or after an operation , dangerous blood clots may not form in his veins . The discoverer of the drug , Dr. Karl Paul Link , professor of biochemistry at the Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment Station , recently told the Harvey Society at the New York Academy of Medicine about it . <P> He made his discovery when cattlemen in North Dakota and Canada complained that some of their stock died from bleeding scratches and bumps , like human hemophiliacs . He found the guilty chemical in spoiled sweet-clover hay , named it Dicumarol because it is formed from the harmless chemical , coumarin , which gives fresh clover its smell . The cows ' problem was solved by planting clover with a low coumarin content . <P> Dr. Link and co-workers went on to get Dicumarol in pure form and then to synthesize it . They found that in the body it makes salicylic acid . Another anticoagulant , heparin , was already on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' blood fluid until it can be processed . But it is an expensive extract of ox lung and liver , must be given by injection , and is hard to control . Therefore surgeons ( who worry lest a fatal clot undo their work ) took up Dicumarol . <P> A patient taking Dicumarol need not fear that he will bleed to death . Dr. Link explained that it can be counteracted by 1 ) a small transfusion , 2 ) a large dose ( an injection ) of vitamin K , the antihemorrhagic vitamin in leafy vegetables .
