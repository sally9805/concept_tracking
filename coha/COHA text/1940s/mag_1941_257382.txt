World War II has yet to produce a great song , but last week some of its saddest were heard in the U.S. The League of American Writers produced an album of records ( $2.75 ) called Behind the Barbed Wire-six songs of the French , Spanish , Italian and German antiFascists who now rot in the French concentration camps of Gurs , Vernet d'Arige , Argels-sur-Mer . <P> The six songs were recorded in Manhattan by a Netherlands-born fighter in the Spanish Civil War , Bart van der Schelling . He wears his chin in a brace , is called " official singer " for the U.S. survivors of the International Brigades of the Loyalists . Singer van der Schelling is backed by an " Exiles Chorus " directed by Earl Robinson ( Ballad for Americans ) . Some of the songs-the Spanish Joven Guardia , the Italian Guardia Rossa , the German Thaelmann-Bataillon , the French Au Devant de la Vie ( music by Soviet Composer Dmitri Shostakovich ) - were composed during the Spanish War . Most of them are in rough , plodding march time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed by a German , Eberhard Schmitt , in the camp at Gurs . Its chorus , translated ( not quite so lame in the original ) : <P> Behind the wire , our courage is unbroken ; <P> We yield to no one ! We 're not broken reeds ! <P> Jail or internment , we 're masters of our lives , <P> Nothing counts with us but deeds ! For where Germany 's and Austria 's sons may be , <P> One goal they cling to : Liberty ! . . .
