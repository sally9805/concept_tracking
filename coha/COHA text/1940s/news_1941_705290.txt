txt ALDRICH APPROVES ' LEND-LEASE ' PLAN Banker Urges ' Overwhelming Support , ' Favors Time Limit - Backs Defense Taxes Warning against partisanship or unnecessary delay , Winthrop W. Aldrich , chairman of the Chase National Bank , urged yesterday that President Roosevelt 's " lend-lease " program for aid to Great Britain receive " overwhelming support in Congress and throughout the country . " He asked , however , for a two-year limit on this grant of power . In making this statement at the annual meeting of stockholders of the bank Mr. Aldrich departed from his prepared speech . " With due appreciation of the danger inherent in any such sweeping grant of powers to the Chief Executive , " Mr. Aldrich said , " it is my considered judgment that this measure should receive overwhelming support in Congress and throughout the country . This is no time for partisanship or for delay beyond that reasonable period for impartial debate necessary to insure the specific provisions of the bill are well designed to accomplish its major purpose . " This declaration took the bank 's stockholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockholder on being recognized by the chair asked : " Why have you gone over to the New Deal ? " Mr. Aldrich replied that it was the only course that a great bank like the Chase could pursue . This stockholder left the meeting abruptly . Another stockholder rose to assert that the woman who had left was still wearing a Willkie button and raised the question whether she had read Mr. Willkie 's endorsement of the bill on Monday . Unprecedented Situation " The grant of power provided for in this bill is unprecedented in American history , " Mr. Aldrich said . " The situation with which we are confronted is also unprecedented . The Axis powers have adopted apolicy of ruthless aggression which is being pursued without regard for international law or the rights of other nations . " For the purpose of adequate defense of this country the Administration must be given such flexible and far-reaching authority as will enable it to meet the exigencies of the occasion as they develop from day to day . Aid to the victims of totalitarian assault must be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration should be promptly entrusted with full power to act , but I concur with the suggestions which have already been made that this grant of power be temporary and that its duration be limited to not more than two years . At the end of this period , by the Grace of God , the emergency may have passed and in any case the extension of // ALDRICH APPROVES LEND-LEASE ' PLAN // power will be open to review by the next Congress elected by the people who , under our system of government , are the ultimate source of all authority . " Mr. Aldrich viewed the present financial problems of the government as twofold , one the problem of financing the government , and the other the problem of financing the defense industries . There is no doubt , he said , but what the government can raise the sums required . The question , he added , is rather how it can raise and spend the money to the least detriment of the community . Sees Taxes Paying for Defense " Congress has already shown that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defense expenditure as possible . That determinatiori is sound financial practice and it accords with the best American tradition . Defense financing by taxation has the merit , among others , of diverting productive effort into channels directly serving the national defense . It does this by limiting useless or postponable expenditure , and by utilizing the funds so relinquished to pay military or other defense costs . There is , however , a certain limit beyond which taxation for defense , as for other purposes , should not go . This is the point at which taxation becomes destructive , in the sense that it encroaches upon the capital equipment of the country . Determining where this point lies is one of the most difficult and delicate decisions that Congress is called upon to make . " He urged that the Treasury should not adopt the " easy way " of financing by relying on the banks to purchase new issues of government securities , but that effort be made to place large amounts of new securities direct with the owners of savings and investment funds . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high interest rates to be attractive to private investors , and that these bonds be made available in small as well as large denominations and that they be fully taxable . In order not to penalize the patriotic subscriber who overestimates his capacity to buy , he suggested that the new bonds be made freely marketable . Warns on Inflationary Methods On the score of bank loans to industry in furtherance of the defense program , he said that while individual loans have been large , notably to the aircraft industry , taking the nation as a whole , only the surface of possibility has been scratched thus far . It is perfectly clear , he said , that a government agency could provide the stake a defense contractor needs , that a government agency could obtain the funds from the Treasury and that the Treasury could obtain funds by selling bonds to the banks . Or , to the extent the law permits , the Treasury could borrow from the Federal Reserve banks or print greenbacks . Every one of these methods , lie reminded , would be inflationary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banking system is prepared to finance the productive activities of industry in any amount that the defense program requires . " Commercial banks , " he continued , " have to rely on their borrower 's to reduce their loans from time to time , preferably out of earnings . If the government- is the borrower from the banks and its expenditures are running ahead of its revenues , the government can not pay down its debt to the banks , but has to increase it . ? The effect of this is constantly to increase the volume of bank credit and therefore the volume of deposits , the effect of which in turn is to raise prices and invite inflation . Financing ' defense on commercial bank credit on the part of government is almost as bad from the public standpoint as to finance vast government undertakings by issuing greenbacks or borrowing from a central bank . As a matter of fact , it was exactly this abuse of central bank credit that culminated in the vast German inflation of 1923 . " In replying to a stockholder 's question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chase National Bank amount to approximately $660,000,000 . In referring to his speech on the gold problem made at the annual meeting a year ago , he said that he still felt that one approach to the problem was through the placing of gold coin in circulation . Net earnings of the bank for 1940 , he reported , amounted to $13,550 , - 000 , equivalent to $1.83 a share . This compared with $13,315,000 the previous year , equivalent to $1.80 a share . He said that after the payment of two semi-annual dividends of 70 cents a share each , the undivided profits account was increased by $3,190,000 . He pointed out that despite the continued decline of interest rates to the lowest levels " yet reached in this era of cheap money , " and despite higher taxes , that the bank had been able to increase its earnings , due to a general increase in the volume of business . Commenting on the bank 's investments , he said that the bank has no German loans , and that its foreign security holdings are chiefly those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by law in England . He said there had been no change during the year in the bank 's holdings of Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation , in National Theatres Corporation and in General Theatres Equipment Corporation . He said that holdings of United States Government obligations at the end of 1940 amounted to $1,098 , - 108,000 , a gain of $277,938,000 on the year . The average maturity of these securities , he said , is two years and five months , on the basis of optional call dates . Total loans and discounts at $664,189,000 were up $28,000,000 on the year . He pointed out that commercial loans gained $71,000,000 , but that brokers ' loans , among loan items , declined $43,000 , - 000 on the year . He reported that despite the wars in Europe and Asia that the bank 's foreign department , on balance , showed a satisfactory profit during 1940 . He reported that the London branches continue to function , though one bomb fell in the courtyard of the main branch there , just missing destruction of the entire building . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite German invasion , and another Paris branch was closed . He revealed that although the bank 's branches in Hong Kong , Tientsin and Shanghai remain open , the families of employes have been ordered back to the United States . The Chase , which ranks as the world 's largest ' commercial bank , showed deposits of $3,543,338,000 at the end of 1940 , a new high for any reporting date in the bank 's history . This represented a gain on the year of $739,608,000 , and since the end of 1938 a gain of $1,309 , - 005,000 . Despite the gain in 1940 the direct deposits of foreign funds seeking refuge in the United States represented a much smaller proportion of the rise in 1940 than in 1939.
