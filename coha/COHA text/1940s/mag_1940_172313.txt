Three weeks ago visitors at University of Michigan 's commencement were startled when President Alexander G. Ruthven exclaimed in his address : " To those young people who are planning to enter or return to the University next year , I issue this warning : Michigan welcomes only students who are convinced that democracy is the ideal form of government for a civilized people . She will not be confused by sophistries built around meaningful but ill-defined phrases such as ' freedom of the press ' or ' freedom of speech , ' but will deal firmly , without fear or favor , with subversive or so-called fifth-column activies . " <P> Undergraduates were not so startled . They guessed the target of President Ruthven 's ire : the campus ' noisy chapter of the American Student Union , which had spent a busy spring denouncing U. S.

A brilliant student , he made Phi Beta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a B.A. at Michigan last year , an M.A. in English literature this year . <P> To the A. S. U. 's howls , President Ruthven turned a deaf ear . But , said he : " This decision is not final . Sometimes we permit students to re-enter on their promise to settle down . "
