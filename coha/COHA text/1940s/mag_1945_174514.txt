No reporters were present at Yalta . But three U.S. newsmen arrived after the conference broke up , made the long trip home with the President . This week the Associated Press 's White House correspondent , Douglas B. Cornell , gathered up his notes , published five articles on Yalta . Some hitherto unknown incidents : <P> A minor crisis arose on the trip to Yalta when the President observed his 63rd birthday . The President 's chefs had baked a cake ; so had the cooks for the officers ' mess . It looked as though one group of chefs would be disappointed , until Daughter Anna Boettiger solved the dilemma . She ordered three more cakes , of varying sizes . The cakes were piled one on top of the other . The first four were labeled First Term , Second Term , Third Term , Fourth Term . On the top cake was a huge question mark . Wrote Correspondent Cornell : " It produced plenty of laughs . " <P> Stalin opened the first session of the conference with the Russian equivalent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his feet , often outstripped his interpreter . Churchill often gesticulated wildly , thundered as though addressing Parliament . President Roosevelt usually talked in a low conversational tone . Added Cornell : " Churchill was the most voluble because he was most frequently in the minority . Mr. Roosevelt and Stalin often found their views coinciding , or at least not far apart . " <P> The American delegation soon learned that it was not necessary to down a full slug of vodka for each toast at the formal dinners . Sometimes the toast could be drunk in a weak wine , sometimes it was only necessary to touch the glass to the lips . But when there was a " big toast " - to a nation or a chief of state-the glasses had to be drained . Vodka and wine were served at all meals , even breakfast . To make sure there would be enough , the Russians brought 14,000 bottles to Yalta . <P> Even though some of the appointments of Livadia Palace were luxurious , the plumbing was elementary . Explained Correspondent Cornell : " Supplementary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoors ; wash basins , pitchers and buckets were supplied indoors . " <P> " Americans were cautioned by an Army detail not to pocket any souvenir towels or spoons because Russia is short in many items and the hosts might receive an ' unfortunate impression .
