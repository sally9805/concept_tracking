Four hundred Mexican students gathered before the Secretariat of Foreign Affairs in Mexico City one day last week , tossed up insults at Pan-American-minded Foreign Minister Ezequiel Padilla . Reason : he had failed ( they claimed ) to protest firmly enough against the attacks by U.S. sailors on Los Angeles zoot suiters of Mexican blood ( TIME , June 21 ) . <P> Pushing on toward the U.S. Embassy , the demonstrators found their path blocked by police squads . In Mexico City 's busiest tourist section , they booed at shops displaying U.S. signs , cheered those with German names . At Sanborn 's , a U.S. restaurant , they stopped . A student entered and roughed one U.S. visitor at his lunch . <P> It was the first anti-U.S . demonstration in Mexico since 1940 ( when disgruntled Almazanistas stoned the U.S. Embassy building where Vice President Henry A. Wallace was dining ) . Mexican newspapers carried full accounts of the incident , considered it a protest against U.S. racial discrimination against Mexicans .
