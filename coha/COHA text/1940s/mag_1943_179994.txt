Wrote a U.S. citizen who served with the American Field Service in Egypt : <P> " I 'd like to say something about the British Tommy . . . not only for myself but for every American who has seen active service with the British . . . . For sheer guts and the ability to keep coming back he has no superiors . I remember one night at Alamein . . . . We were trying to get through the minefields . . . . Tanks were to blast their way through , spread out on the other side , and work forward . We were being followed by a unit of light infantry . <P> " Well , the tanks got through all right . Then all hell broke loose . ... Jerry opened up with everything he had . The tanks were forced to drop back on us and we had so many casualties that we could n't back up . <P> " And then , in the face of one of the worst barrages I 've seen , the British infantry came up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with their rifles at port , they marched into it . I saw men with their heads blown off ... men with arms and legs shot away . There was no hope of getting through . But they kept on , wave after wave of them , and they marched in singing . . . . Under the barrage you could feel the beat of their singing . . . then when the noise of the firing would lift for brief seconds you 'd hear their voices rolling out . I do n't think I have ever felt such pride in fellow men . "
