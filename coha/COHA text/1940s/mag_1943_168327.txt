He was Bishop Panteleimon ( rhymes with Damon ) , who escaped to Egypt from his see on the Greek Island of Euboea . <P> All over Greece , said Bishop Panteleimon , priests have risked their lives to aid Greek guerrillas harrying the Italians and Nazis . Many a Greek Orthodox priest has lost his life because he sheltered wounded British soldiers or in other ways offended the Nazi invaders . One priest was starved in a small cell for 28 days . Nazis forced another priest to witness the slaughter of all his children and grandchildren+ except one , then he and the last child were tortured and slain . One abbot was dragged out of his small monastery by his beard , shot dead . A priest at Herakleion Cathedral , accused of aiding the guerrillas , was stripped naked in the sanctuary , forced to dig his own grave , then shot . Most of these priests , said the Bishop , died murmuring prayers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also told of a youth who was charged by an Italian court-martial with attempting to blow up two boats in the harbor of Piraeus . " Excuse me , " the young man interrupted , " it was three boats . " <P> +Greek Orthodox priests marry .
