Sensible , white-topped Elmer Davis , who is gradually taking charge of some matters that vex the U.S. people , used some plain and sensible language to tell off one of last week 's chief people-vexers . He wrote to Boss James Caesar Petrillo of the American Federation of Musicians : <P> " On December 27 , 1941 , you wrote an open letter to the President and the people of the United States . In that letter you said : Each and every member of the Federation and its officers pledge themselves on this occasion to do everything possible to aid in the fight for freedom . <P> " Despite this public and published pledge you sent a communication on June 25 , 1942 to all companies engaged in the making of phonograph records , electrical transcriptions , and other forms of mechanical recording of music , advising them that union members would make no more records . <P> " I am informed that if you enforce this edict three direct consequences will be the elimination of new electrical transcriptions for the use of radio stations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes , ' and the elimination of new popular and classical records for home consumption . I am further informed that this move in all probability will lead to court fights , possible strikes , and definitely curtailed musical service to the public in-the critical months ahead . It can scarcely fail to have a negative effect on morale . <P> " Therefore , on behalf of the people of the United States , I sincerely urge that you consider it your patriotic duty to stand by your pledge of December 27 , 1941 , and withdraw your ultimatum of June 25 , 1942 . " <P> Petrillo 's answer was one Mr. Davis might have expected . He asserted that his union would " continue to cooperate , " added : " I can tell by your letter that you have been completely misinformed throughout . " <P> Commented Elmer Davis , with restraint : " I am glad that he intends to cooperate , but I do n't see how he can cooperate without changing his position . " <P> Why should Elmer Davis , head of the Office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petrillo ? He had a farfetched excuse : several hundred radio stations which broadcast war information can not keep going without " canned " music . But the truth seemed to be that Elmer Davis was becoming a sort of Presidential deputy , in charge of putting the people 's thoughts into official language . This would be a useful development .
