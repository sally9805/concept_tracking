Speed Limit Thursday TIRE CHECK EVERY 60 DAYS Drive Begins Here to Compel Display of the Allotment Symbols on All Cars Special to TEE Nsw TORS Timms . WASHINGTON , Sept. 26 ? National rationing of gasoline by coupons probably will go into effect about Nov. 22 , Leon Henderson , the Price Administrator , made known today . At the same time , Joseph B. Eastman , Director of the Office of Defense Transportation , said that a speed limit of thirty-five miles an hour for all rubber-tired vehicles except common carriers on scheduled route service would be made effective next Thursday . The ruling will be effective on the common carriers on Oct. 15 . Both moves were ordered yesterday by William M. Jeffers , the Rubber Administrator . Mr. Henderson said that tires on all cars must be submitted to OPA agents for " on-wheel " inspection ? every sixty days . Aid of Governors Is Asked Mr. Eastman 's statement said that he would ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council of State Governments , to put the thirty-five-mile limit in effect through proclamation or otherwise and to call upon State and  --  local officials for strict enforcement . The two-week delay in the application of the order to common carriers was given to permit them to make necessary adjustments in their operations , Mr. Eastman explained . In issuing the order he also revoked provisions of earlier orders of his agency limiting to forty miles an hour the speed of over-the-road common carriers , contract and private carriers and taxicabs . The only vehicles not included in the speed limit are those of the armed services or cars operated in emergencies for the protection or preservation of life and health or for public safety . However , the latter must not be driven " at a rate of speed ' in excess of that which is reasonable under conditions prevailing at such times . " Will Follow Eastern Plan The new nation-wide gasoline rationing plan , Mr. Henderson said , will follow the plan now in operation for the 7,500,000 automobiles in the East , with each of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasoline for 2,880 miles of driving a year , figured at fifteen miles to a gallon . Additional gasoline will be allowed only on proof of need and in quantities strictly limited to the degree of essentiality to the nation 's war effort . This gasoline rationing system will then be meshed into the tire rationing program to bring the over-all mileage within the limits of the available rubber supply , with use of tires being limited to essential needs . Observance of the 35-mile speed limit will be a basic requirement in both gasoline and tire ration allowances , Mr. Henderson said . The nation-wide mileage rationing plan was worked out by the OPA. following publication of the Baruch. committee 's rubber conservation report on Sept. 10 . These advance preparations make it possible to have the system in operation two weeks sooner than otherwise would have been possible , Mr. Henderson said . 20,000,000 Cars Are Affected Some 20,000,000 passenger cars outside of the present gasoline rationed area will be included when the plan goes into effect , he went on . He estimated that mileage rationing would cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the normal rate . Owners of cars in the area to be included will be required to register to receive their books . The , time and places for this registration will be announced later . Additional mileage up to 470 miles a month may be obtained by the motorist who can show that the " A " book is not sufficient to // WIDER ' GAS ' RATION IN EFFECT NOV. 22 // meet his occupational needs , and who shows either that he has formed a car-sharing club to keep his car filled to capacity while in use , or that he has been unable to do so and that there is no other means of transportation available to him . As in the Eastern rationed area , a special " preferred mileage " category will be provided for fourteen types of occupations deemed essential to the war effort and to the public health and safety . These rations , issued through a " C " book , I are tailored to meet the need without a specific ceiling on the mileage . The deviations from the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , since the Eastern plan was designed for possible extension . It already has reduced average passenger car mileage almost to the objective of 5.000 miles set by the Baruch report . The changes required for the rest of the country will be incorporated in the Eastern plan when nation-wide mileage rationing beoomes effective , so that all cars throughout the country will be operating under a single set of rules , Mr. Henderson said . National rationing of gasoline will require the - setting up of an extensive organization to issue the books and handle the supplementary applications . Local rationing boards will be asked to augment their staffs with temporary volunteer workers to handle the extra work , and instructions will be sent to them well in advance of the registration period . Supplying the necessary coupons and forms and organizing for the undertaking is a task which will require more than six weeks to complete , Mr. Henderson estimated . He said orders have been placed for the safety paper and the printing of 60,000,000 books of gasoline ration coupons , 91,000,000 gummed sheets for preservation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 60,000,000 application forms and some 100 , - 000,000 copies of audit control forms , regulation books , instruction guides and other necessary forms .
