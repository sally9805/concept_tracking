" I know beautiful women and I know beautiful horses , " says Elizabeth Arden patly . " I pick them for their conformation . " ( " She picks horses for their long beautiful tails , " says Trainer Tom Smith . ) " I know good horses by the look in their eyes , " she says . " Mr. Smith knows their soundness , but I know if they are beautiful . " All of which is O.K. with philosophical Trainer Smith , who gets only mildly upset when his boss brings him Arden eye lotion for the horses ' eyes and Arden " Eight Hour Cream " for their chafed spots . <P> Names &; Numbers . No matter how she picks them , the Arden horses are doing all right this summer . War Jeep , a three-year-old colt , won the Jamaica Handicap and the Skokie Handicap . War Date , a three-year-old filly , won the Princess Doreen Stakes and the Modesty Handicap . Beaugay , which some think may be the best two-year-old filly now racing , won the Fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stakes-for a total take of $48,390 . <P> Beautician Arden has a lot of fun naming her horses . Beaugay got hers " because the horse was so beautiful and gay . " A little too gay sometimes , the skittish filly often snaps at her self-styled " sugar mama , " wo n't have anything to do with her . <P> Other Arden horses to watch are Harvey 's Pal ( " The play Harvey was such a good show " ) , Blue Gem ( " Oh , he 's so beautiful ; he has eyes of blue " ) and the $46,000 yearling Colony Boy , named for Manhattan 's famed Colony Restaurant . Still another is Knockdown , which placed second in last week 's Arlington Futurity . <P> Whether they win or lose , their owner remains essentially exuberant . " This is my pleasure-I 'm in it for sport , " explains the woman who is listed by her non-professional name-Mrs . Elizabeth N. Graham-in the Daily Racing Form . Now that her stable is stuck in the Chicago area by ODT 's shipping ban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 64-day Washington Park meet opening next week . It is certain to add a lot of profitable sport to the $141,270 's worth ( gross winnings ) she has already had this season . <P> Hags &; Horses . Although the queen of the country 's third largest industry has become a force to reckon with in the sport of kings , beauty is still her chief interest ( she flatly denies rumors that she may sell her cosmetic business for $13 million ) . One small facet of that business is the farm for which her racing stable is named , Maine Chance ( " I just went to Maine one summer , and liked this farm so I took a chance and bought it " ) . Women who want to be as consistently " winning " as her horses pay $350 a week ( adjoining bath ) or $400 ( private bath ) for a thorough beautification at the " farm . " " You should see the old hags that come to us , and we make of them something beautiful , " says Miss Arden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slump down into themselves and deteriorate . They should stretch - like a horse does ! "
