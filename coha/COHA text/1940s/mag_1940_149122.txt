The tough and gamy steelhead trout does not like to be artificially bred . In Oregon hatcheries , breeders get eggs from trapped females by " stripping , " or squeezing their bellies so that the eggs spurt out into a pan . Males are stripped of their milt in the same way , and when the eggs and milt are brought together , fertilization takes place quickly . But experts say that stripping a fighting , kicking steelhead is " like trying to milk a galloping cow with a greased udder . " When the fish struggle hardest , large batches of eggs and milt may be sprayed out helter-skelter and lost . <P> Dr. Francis Friday Griffiths , chief of scientific investigations for the Oregon State Game Commission , last week announced success of a twilight sleep technique for steelheads . The fish are taken from the traps , dunked in a solution of two parts of ether to 100 parts of water . Inert after a minute or two , they are easily stripped with practically no loss of eggs or milt . Then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprightly as ever . Hatchery superintendents believe that ether anesthesia will enable them to work with smaller crews next spring .
