They get 50% more for crops than a year ago and 36% more for sales of livestock . Farmers have to pay more now for many things , too , but prices paid by them have not shot up so fast as the prices they are receiving for their own products . Cash farm income for 1541 was estimated to total 10.7 billion , or 17% more than ' ant year . The value of farms has gone up too , since the more money farmers ' get for their products the more their land is worth .
