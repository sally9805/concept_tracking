( See Cover ) <P> Somewhere in eastern Asia , probably at Rangoon , members of the Unified Allied Supreme Command ( see p. 17 ) met this week to make ready an Allied success . There a good man reported to his chief on one of the shortest , strangest and grimmest commands ever held by a British general . <P> The good man was General Sir Henry Royds Pownall , who only a fortnight earlier had become Britain 's Far Eastern Commander . The shortness was no fault of his : he was promoted to be Chief of Staff in the Supreme Command . The grimness was Malaya 's : half its tin mines in the hands of the Japs , one-sixth of its rubber plantations lost , Singapore threatened , all of its strategic and material riches poised as if under an auctioneer 's mallet : going . . . going . . . . <P> The Supreme Command 's first responsibility to the Allies would be to repair the Malayan damage and save Singapore . General Pownall 's first responsibility to the Supreme Command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had brief but concentrated acquaintance , and to recommend steps to be taken . The steps would have to be taken in haste , for the situation as he described it was alarming : on the west coast the Japanese were within 270 miles of Singapore , on the east coast within 175 miles . <P> Mammal Enemy . One cause of the jam , General Pownall reported , was that the Japs were as good as animals in the jungle . They came on in polygenetic clothes : in shorts and sneakers , or Malayan dress , or just their underwear . They forced natives to lead them through tangled byways . They pushed about with high , merry tail , like hunting dogs , sniffing out coveys of defenders . With their bare hands they made rafts of logs and rode down rivers such as the Perak . They stole bicycles , food and shoes from Malayans and Chinese , went forward faster , stronger and better shod than before . They grabbed barges at Penang , skimmed the coast and tried to make landings below British positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkeys , on passing patrols . Every hardship which a hungry animal could tolerate and many an in genuity it could not conceive , they experienced and used . <P> Typical of their desperate opportunism were the landings they made below British lines on the west coast-in waters which ought to have been British right to the bottom . When they took Penang intact , they gathered all the barges , junks , launches , yachts and sampans in sight and set off , like a Japanese print of a Strength Through Joy outing , down the coast . At the mouth of the Perak , near Telok Anson , they sent a large launch as a kind of decoy into the estuary . A British patrol boat approached to investigate . The Japanese strung a line of laundry on the boat , to give the impression of being on a pleasure cruise . When the British vessel got close by , the Japanese opened fire . Mean while the main Japanese flotilla proceeded 14 miles farther south , landed safely .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
