To Arch Oboler , the nicest thing about winning a prize is making the acceptance speech . In his twelve years of radio writing , he has done plenty of both . But unlike his writing ( Alter Ego , Free World Theater , etc . ) , Oboler 's speeches seldom please radio . In Oklahoma City , in a talk he titled " Bughum " ( " humbug , backwards " ) , Arch paid his respects to radio : <P> " An amazing assortment of evasions , half-truths and untruths activate the kilocycles . Radio actresses whose only acquaintance with hose washing is an occasional rinsing of ... nylons in a hotel bedroom . . . stand before microphones and read ' authentic testimonials ' about soap flakes . . . . <P> " Tremendous cigaret campaigns are concocted out of nothingness . . . . Nostrums , patent medicines . . . stomach and head soothers . . . speak their own brand of falsehoods . . . through joke and jingle . <P> " Radio advertising has not assumed its responsibilities to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . Only those articles which have special values should be permitted to extol those values . <P> " You may ask what this has to do with radio writing . Simply that some of us ca n't write honest radio under such circumstances . " <P> Then he went back to Hollywood to begin work on another speech on the same theme . The occasion : a Peabody Award ( TIME , March 25 ) , this month . Said he : " I will amplify my feelings about radio 's part in the post-atomic world . My feeling is that most people are as nauseated as I am . It is n't enough to be amused when you have to endure those horrible jangle-jingles. "
