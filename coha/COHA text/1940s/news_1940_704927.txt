txt After three weeks of agitation the Senate Military Affairs Committee reported favorably today , by a 13 to 3 vote , the draft bill , the full title of which is the Burke-Wadsworth selective compulsory military training bill . Thus Congress will shortly be called upon to vote upon the measure which brings the threat of war closer into the personal lives of many families than any event that has yet occurred since the rise of Adolf Hitler . The bill , which has been vastly altered and modified since it was first introduced stipulates a training period of one year for all draftees between the ages of 21 and 31 years of age . There are 4,500,000 such young men in the country , but those with dependents or who are essential to industry or agriculture would be exempted . Military officials have discussed calling up 400,000 by Oct. 1 and 600,000 more by next April under the present measure . President Asked Changes As the bill was originally drawn it called for registration of all American males between 18 and 64 . President Roosevelt last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to know the extent of man-power available . The vote : For : Sheppard ( D ) of Texas , Reynolds ( D ) of North Carolina , Elbert D. Thomas ( D ) of Utah , Minton ( D ) of Indiana , Lee ( D ) of Oklahoma , Schwartz ( D ) of Wy- oming . Hill ( D ) of Alabama , Chandler ( D ) of Kentucky , Smothers ( D ) ( proxy ) of New Jersey , and Austin ( R ) of Vermont , Gurney ( R ) of South Dakota , Holman ( R ) of Oregon , Bridges ( R ) of New Hampshire ( proxy ) . Against : Johnson ( D ) of Colorado , Lundeen ( F-L ) of Minnesota and Thomas ( II ) of Idaho . Sheridan Downey ( D ) of California did not vote and James M. Slattery ( D ) of Illinois was absent . The Senate meanwhile today went ahead with its debate on a companion bill which would empower the President to mobilize the National Guard and the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this measure . The Burke-Wadsworth bill will come up as soon as the mobilization bill is disposed of . under present plans . Before reporting out the draft bill the Committee adopted a recommendation of Senator Austin which would apply the job security provisions to volunteers as well as trainees . At present , employers in interstate commerce would be compelled to rehire the trainee or the volunteer under the threat of Wagner Act penalties . A few minor technical changes were made in the measure before it was finally oted upon . New Step in Defense The Committee 's action today marks a new stage in the development of the United States preparedness drive : A stage in which Congress must finally come to grips with the problem of making far-reaching new decisions in terms other than appropriation . The pending draft bill is a human and personal problem that will potentially affect every family in the land with a son between 21 and 31 . Congress realizes that it is easier to pass bills for big appropriations than to interfere in family life . Tendencies to trim down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its importance . The disposition of Congressmen confronted with such a dilemma is to seek a compromise . At present the compromise being proposed by Senator Francis T. Maloney ( D ) of Connecticut is to raise the basic army pay of enlisted men from $21 to S30 a month , and put into effect a 1-year voluntary enlistment plan . It would also defer conscription till after a certain date to see if volunteers could not be secured . Isolationists will do their best to beat the conscription bill in practically any form . In a recent symposium , Senators Burton K. Wheeler ( D ) of Montana , Gerald P. Nye ( R ) of North Dakota , Rush Holt ( D ) of West Virginia , as well as Norman Thomas , Socialist leader , denounced conscription in heated terms . Essentially , the issue in Congress boils down to whether the United States is really threatened by the rise of Hitler . Those who believe the United States can escape danger even if England capitulates , see no need for conscription . The reverse is true on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now wants to train and equip a force of 1,200.000 men . This would mean some 700,000 more in addition to present National Guard and Regular Army , in the next eight months .
