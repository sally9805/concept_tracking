For the umpteenth time Sister Elizabeth Kenny , the Australian nurse who developed the Kenny treatment for infantile paralysis , last week threatened to go home . Her running feud with orthodox medical men has long enlivened the press ( TIME , Sept. 27 , 1943 ; June 26 ) . And her forthright disposition has earned her the nicknames " The Duchess " and " Madam Queen . " Not satisfied when doctors accept her methods , she insists that they also accept her theories-theories that many experts say lack proof . <P> Sister Kenny ascribes her present huff to three new indignities : 1 ) no research men have come to the Elizabeth Kenny Institute in Minneapolis to study her methods ; 2 ) the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis refused to give her as much money for research as she thinks she needs ( $840,000 ) ; 3 ) her permit to stay in the U.S. will expire in May ; to stay on she must apply for a renewal . <P> A fourth source of irritation has resulted from her recently acquired interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncoordinated movements . When she took four such cases into the Kenny Institute for treatment , local doctors had them removed . Sister Kenny soon resigned from the Institute . The Institute 's board of directors refused to accept Sister Kenny 's resignation and the Institute promised to do " everything hu manly possible " to further the research she wants . <P> The day after Sister Kenny made her latest threat to go home , New York 's Representative Donald L. O'Toole introduced a bill proposing a Congressional investigation of the opposition to Sister Kenny . On hearing of the bill , Sister Kenny announced that she would wait : " . . . I do consider in all fairness that the suggested Congressional investigation should be initiated at once in order that the people of America . . . should know the truth . If it is their desire that I leave . . . I shall go . If it is their desire that I stay , I shall remain . "                 @ @ @ @
