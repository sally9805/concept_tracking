FEW CHAPTERS in the history of chemistry are more romantic than the story of dyes . Long before he could write , prehistoric man had learned to stain his body and dye his garments with juices extracted from plants and insects . Wrappings on Egyptian mummies buried before 3000 B.C. show clearly the blue dye of the indigo plant and the red of the madder root . A secretion that the ancients obtained , drop by drop , from . , tiny mollusk found on the shores of the eastern Mediterranean yielded the famous Tyrian purple , a dye so expensive that it long was the badge of royalty . All of the early dyes were laboriously obtained from plants , certain insects and mollusks , and a few minerals . Those few that did not fade from washing or sunlight could be counted on the fingers of one hand . A great step forward came in 1856 . Working in an attic laboratory in his London home , William Henry Perkin , an 18-year-old chemistry student , in that year stumbled upon the treasure of coal-tar dyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , Perkin was trying to synthesize quinine from aniline oil , a secondary substance which is produced from the messy black tar left as a waste product when coal is burned for gas and coke . Instead of white crystals of quinine , he got an ugly mass of a sticky dark substance . When - he tried to rinse it from the test tube , the mass surprisingly dissolved into a beautiful purple solution . This result intrigued Perkin and he did not rest until he had found the . reason . His purple , or violet , solution soon was named " mauve . " It eventually became the foundation of the coal-tar dye industry . Within a few years chemists had synthesized magenta . Then came synthetic alizarin , madder 's chief coloring principle , and synthetic indigo . Today there are more than 5,000 coal-tar dyes .  | Any colored solution is not necessarily a dye . To serve as a dye , the solution must penetrate a textile or other material and deposit its coloring matter so firmly in the fibers that handling and washing will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the color also must not fade or change after prolonged exposure to light and air . The simplest to use are " direct ' dyes , those which attach themselves directly to a textile either by chemical reaction with the fiber or by mechanical adhesion . Many vegetable dyes and most packaged synthetic dyes are of this type . Many of the most permanent synthetic dyes , however , are developed directly in the textile fiber by means of a few amazing tricks of chemical sleight-of-hand . Indigo , aniline black , azo colors , and mineral dyes all make use of this magic . With a few grams of indigo and some sodium hyposulphite , you can demonstrate the production of what is undoubtedly the best inexpensive blue dye ever made . Sodium hyposulphite is known as sodium hydrosulphite in the dyeing trade and should not be confused with sodium thiosulphate , the " hypo " used in photography . As purchased , indigo is a darkblue powder or paste that is insoluble in water . To make it soluble , it must be reduced ( that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mix 2 grams of powdered indigo with 1 1/2 grams of sodium hydroxide dissolved in 5 ml. of water in a test tube . Then stir in an additional 20 ml. of water and support the tube in a water bath heated to 50 deg . C. When the solution is heated , stir it well and slowly add 1 1/2 grams of sodium hyposulphite . Let this mixture stand for about half an hour , keeping the temperature constant and stirring occasionally . At the end of that time , the blue indigo should have changed to a yellow or colorless " indigo white . " Indigo is called a vat dye because in days gone by the color was reduced ' and made soluble by a fermentation process in huge tanks or vats . Today hyposulphite takes the place of these ferments . You can prepare an experimental " vat " by adding a few grains of hyposulphite to 250 ml. of water in a beaker and heating the water to 50 deg . C. After 10 minutes , add the contents of the test tube . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your magic . Dip a white cotton cloth into your vat and let it remain for a minute . As long as it is submerged , the cloth stays white . But lift it out and in a minute it turns blue . Repeated dipping and exposure darken it . What happens is this : By reaction with the oxygen of the air , the . de-oxidized colorless  | indigo saturated through the cloth is changed back into indigo of the original color . Because indigo is insoluble , washing will carry away only the little that is at tached loosely to the surface . The remainder is bound permanently to the fabric . Another important and extremely fast coaltar dye is aniline black , developed directly in the cloth by the oxidation of aniline . This oily liquid yields dyes of every hue of the rainbow , but aniline itself is colorless . Be careful in handling aniline , for the fumes and the liquid are poisonous . If you spill any on your hands , rinse them with water im mediately . Prepare some aniline hydrochloride by adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aniline in a small beaker . Dissolve the resulting crystals by adding 10 ml. of water . To this solution add 3 grams of potassium chlorate , as an oxidizing agent , and 1 gram of copper sulphate to serve as a catalyst . Soak a strip of white cotton cloth in this solution for several minutes . When you remove it , it still will be white . But blot off the excess solution and suspend the strip in a flask in which water is boiling , and the cloth will quickly change to black . The heat and moisture of the steam hasten the oxidation of the aniline . Several excellent mineral colors , considerably older than coal-tar dyes , also are made by precipitating an insoluble chemical directly into a textile . Chrome yellow , a brilliant color , is a good example . In one glass dissolve ii gram of lead acetate in 25 ml. of water , and in another b gram of potassium bichromate in an equal amount of water . Dip a strip of cotton in the first solution , remove it , blot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yellow lead chromate is precipitated into the cloth . Repeat the process and the color becomes deeper . You can also produce the bright orange of basic lead chromate by passing the dyed cloth quickly through a boiling solution of calcium hydroxide . Another widely used mineral color is iron buff , the basis for some khaki dyes . This is really iron rust deliberately precipitated into a textile . You can produce the color by dipping a cloth successively into three colorless solutions . First pour 100 ml. of water into each of three glasses . In the first , dissolve 2 grams of ferrous sulphate ; in the  | second , 5 ml. of concentrated ammonium hydroxide ; in the third , 10 ml. of 5-percent sodium hypochlorite solution . Now dip your strip of cloth , blotting it between clips . The ammonia will change the ferrous sulphate into green-gray ferrous hydroxide . The hypochlorite in turn oxidizes this into brown ferric hydroxide , which , when dry , changes to the oxide . You can also change your iron buff into Prussian blue . Dip the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or sodium ferrocyanide and 20 drops of hydrochloric acid dissolved in 100 ml. of water . This solution itself will be colorless , but when the buff-dyed cloth is taken out it will have changed to an attractive Prussian blue . Many dyes fail to attach themselves strongly to certain textiles , but they can be forced to do so by first treating the textiles with colorless insoluble compounds called mordants . These usually are metal hydroxides which cling to the textile fibers and either absorb or react chemically with the dye . When a chemical reaction takes place , the resulting color is called a " lake " and may be entirely different from that of the dye . Designs of different colors sometimes are produced with a single dye and different mordants . You can show this by painting part of a piece of cotton cloth with a solution of ferrous sulphate , such as that used in the iron buff experiment , and another part with a similar solution of potassium alum . Leave a third part of the cloth unpainted . Blot off the excess solution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blot once more , and immerse for 10 minutes in a 2-percent suspension of alizarin red dye in water . When the cloth has been removed and rinsed , you will find that the part mordanted with the alum will remain a bright orange-red , that the area mordanted with iron will be a clark red-brown , while the part which was not mordanted at all will remain practically colorless . Thus , it can be seen , from these few experiments , how far dye chemistry has progressed from the natural indigo and madder of the ancients . Modern chemistry is constantly robbing the rainbow of all of its colors to give us the varied hues in our textiles that most of us now accept just as a matter of course .  |
