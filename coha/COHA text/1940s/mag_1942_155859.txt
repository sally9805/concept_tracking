That good , hard face , with its deep lines and its one eye blank , was back in people 's minds again . General Sir Archibald Wavell , for better or for worse the most famous Allied commander in the whole war , was to take up a post difficult in more than one sense : Supreme Commander of all forces-sea , land and air-of all nations fighting the Japanese in the southwest Pacific area . <P> The armchair strategists might debate until their rockers broke about the subtle pros &; cons of Sir Archibald 's generalship in the Middle East last year : whether he was too cautious , or too slow , or too orthodox ( TIME , Oct. 14 , 1940 ) . But to the men and women , both in Britain and the U.S. , to whom the war was more a worry than an avocation , Archie Wavell was still the best damn general on our side . MacArthur ( TIME , Dec. 29 , and see p. 19 ) was right up there , but he had his hands full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wavell 's Deputy Supreme Commander-in other words his chief sidekick , his alter ego-was to be Major General George H. Brett , 55 , Chief of the Air Corps of the U.S. Army . A good choice , certainly . He would assure the air arm of a hearing . An expert on supply , he would see to first things first : secure lines before tactical missions . Fresh from a tour which took in Egypt , Britain , India and Russia , he probably knew more about problems of Allied cooperation than any other U.S. officer . Grey-haired , dapper , popular , he has not let desk duties ground him , and he is still a crackerjack fighter pilot . <P> General Wavell 's naval commander will be Admiral Thomas C. Hart , Commander in Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet . A good choice , certainly . The focus of all operations in the southwest Pacific is a British naval base , Singapore , but the greatest actual and potential naval power in the Pacific is U.S. power . And even the British are willing to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues think he is more than that ; they think he is as tough of mind as he is wiry of body , that he is aggressive , independent , wide-awake ( TIME , Nov. 24 ) . <P> General Wavell 's Chief of Staff will be General Sir Henry Royds Pownall , who has just done a one-two-three stint as Commander in Chief of British forces in the Far East . A logical choice , from the looks of things ( see p. 20 ) . <P> Because he is too big to be put under even the Wavell hat , China 's Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek was given supreme command over land and air forces of the Allies in the China area . Besides-and this was a significant clue as to the possible operation of the joint command-the Gissimo will lead in " such portions of Indo-China and Thailand as may be available to troops of the united nations . " <P> Inexorable Quadruplets . Thus the Allied world greeted a piece of precedent-shattering news last week by examining and approving the personalities involved . There had been instances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one man been in command of all the weapons of several nations in a whole sector of the earth .
