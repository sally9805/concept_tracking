The human race has never been more vulnerable to high-flying generalities . At Princeton last week , J. B. S. Haldane , 54 , Britain 's grand not-very-old man of biology and vicinity , let loose some scary ones before a learned symposium on genetics , paleontology and evolution . Some of them : <P> The atomic bomb was genetically bad , said he : " The tremendous amount of radiation generated in the explosion of an atomic bomb produces mutations in the genes , carriers of heredity . These mutations in the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki will affect future generations ( TIME , Nov. 11 ) . <P> " The killing of 10% of humanity . . . with atomic bombs might not destroy civilization . But the production of abnormalities in 10% of the population by gene mutations induced by radioactivity may very easily destroy it . " Destruction need not be immediate ; mutated genes are insidious skulkers . They may lie in wait for centuries in the germ plasm , spreading by intermarriage through the population . Then , when they get their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or burden it with physical or mental defects . <P> Glimmers for Tomorrow . If the race dodges atomic hexing , said Haldane , it may proceed to higher things . In a thousand years or so , it might learn to control its own evolution . Future men would be better adapted to a civilized life . <P> " If I am right . . . the man of the future would probably have great muscular skill but little muscular strength , a large head , fewer teeth than ourselves , and so on . He would develop very slowly , perhaps not learning to speak till five years of age , but continuing to learn up to the age of 40 , and then living several centuries . . . . <P> " He would be more rational and less instinctive , less subject to sexual and parental emotion , to rage on the one hand and to so-called herd instincts on the other . His motivation would depend far more than ours on education . . . . He would be of high general intelligence by our standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the degree which we call genius . . . . <P> " From our point of view , he would be an unpleasant individual , just as we would be to the Peking man . " <P> Professor Alfred S. Romer of Harvard was not so sure that Man would evolve so triumphantly . " If we were dinosaurs , back in the days of their greatness , " he said , " we would probably have had similar thoughts ( if we 'd had brains to think them ) . The dinosaurs did n't go further , and became extinct . " <P> What creature , then , might inherit the earth ? " Rats , " said Professor Romer.
