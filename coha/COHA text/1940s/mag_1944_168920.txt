Back from Paris to Rome last week went a group of five chastised but unchastened U.S. and British correspondents after one of the war 's most spectacular journalistic jaunts . Late last month , led by the A.P . ' s Ed Kennedy , the five had commandeered an Army jeep and driver , set out from the southern to the northern French theater of operations without permission . Their aim : to be the first Americans to " make a juncture " with U.S. troops in the northern theater . They were the first , by ten days , having passed unscathed between two German columns . For this scandalous breach of regulations the five were suspended ( i.e. , forbidden to file copy ) by Brigadier General Tristram Tupper-for two days . <P> Meantime last week six other U.S. and British correspondents ( including CBS 's Larry Lesueur ) who had made unauthorized broadcasts from Paris ( TIME , Sept. 11 ) heard their own suspension sentence : 30 days .                @ @ @ @ @
