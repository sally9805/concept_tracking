The 21st Detective Squad , second floor of the 21st Precinct Police Station , New York City . The major area of the stage is occupied by the squad room ; to the right , separated by a door and an invisible wall , we glimpse a fragment of the LIEUTENANT 'S office . Severe , nakedly institutional , ghostridden , these rooms are shabby , three-quarters of a century old , with an effluvium of their own , compounded of seventy-five years of the tears and blood of human anguish , despair , passion , rage , terror , and violent death . The walls are olive green to the waist and light green above . In the wall upstage , two ceiling-high windows guarded by iron grillwork . The entrance , stage left , is surrounded by an iron railing with a swinging gate . Tacked to the wall , a height chart ; next to it , a folding fingerprint shelf ; above that , a green-shaded light . Adjoining , a bulletin board , upon which are tacked several notices , photographs of criminals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone desk , on which are two phones . Downstage left is another desk , on it a typewriter . High on the main wall , a large electric clock ; beneath it , a duty board with replaceable celluloid letters , reading " On Duty  --  Det . Gallagher , Det . Dakis , Lt. Monoghan . " In the segment of the LIEUTENANT 'S office , a desk , a swivel chair , several small chairs , some files , a watercooler , a coatrack , etc . A small window in the LIEUTENANT 'S office looks out upon an air shaft . Through it we catch a glimpse of the window of the washroom , the door to which is upstage right . The light is fading . It is late afternoon , five-twenty by the clock on the wall . Through the main windows , a magnificent view of the city and its towering skyscrapers ; dominating the panorama are a General Motors sign , a church spire , and a cross . At the curtain 's rise , NICHOLAS DAKIS is seated at the typewriter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who has been picked up for shoplifting . At the phone desk his partner , GALLAGHER , is writing up some " squeals , " and sipping Coca-Cola from the bottle . A traffic policeman in uniform pauses momentarily in the doorway to murmur a greeting to another uniformed policeman ; then they vanish . DETECTIVE GALLAGHER is a young man , third-grade , a novice about 27 years of age , and good-looking in spite of a broken nose . The heat has him a little down : he is sweating profusely and every once in awhile he plucks at his moist shirt , which clings to his body . He and his partner , DETECTIVE DAKIS , are in their shirtsleeves , their collars open . DAKIS is a bull of a man , as wide as he is high . He has a voice like the roll of a kettledrum . He is a middle-aged Greek American . He tackles his job efficiently and unemotionally , in an apparently offhand , casual manner  --  as indeed do most of the detectives . The SHOPLIFTER is a shapeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice is the blat of a moose calf , and , in spite of her avowed guilt , she has all the innocence of ignorance . DETECTIVE NICHOLAS DAKIS Hair ? Squints at her frazzled hair . p. 3 SHOPLIFTER Brown . DETECTIVE NICHOLAS DAKIS typing , hunt-and-peck system : Brown . He squints at her eyes . Eyes ? SHOPLIFTER Blue . DETECTIVE NICHOLAS DAKIS types:Blue . The phone rings . GALLAGHER picks up the receiver . DETECTIVE GALLAGHER 21st Squad Detectives , Gallagher . Yes , Madame , what is your name , please ? He reaches for a pencil and pad , glances at the clock , writes.Address ? Phone number ? Plaza 9-1855 DETECTIVE NICHOLAS DAKIS Weight ? DETECTIVE GALLAGHER as the other desk phone rings:One second , please . He picks up the other receiver , balancing the first on his shoulder . 21st Squad Detectives , Gallagher .

He calls to DAKIS.Hey , Nick , what was the price on that purse she lifted ? SHOPLIFTER mournfully:Six dollars . DETECTIVE NICHOLAS DAKIS to the SHOPLIFTER:Five-foot-one . All right , come back . The SHOPLIFTER returns to the desk . DETECTIVE GALLAGHER on the phone:Six bucks . DETECTIVE NICHOLAS DAKIS Age ? SHOPLIFTER Twenty-seven . Corrects herself , quickly.Twenty-two . DETECTIVE NICHOLAS DAKIS squints at her , types:Twenty  --  seven . DETECTIVE GALLAGHER on the phone:Right , Loot . It come in too late . Night court . Right , chief . He hangs up , applies the other receiver.Sorry , Mrs. Glances at his pad . Andrews . Yes . Have you a list of just what 's missing ? It would help . Any cash ? You do ? One of the servants ? All right . I 'll be there . Yes , Madame . Hangs up , makes some notes on the scratch pad , sips at the Coca-Cola bottle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice as much for a pocketbook . DETECTIVE NICHOLAS DAKIS matter of fact , no animus:Well , you took it . SHOPLIFTER I do n't know why . It was crazy . DETECTIVE NICHOLAS DAKIS shrugs it off:It 's your first offense . You 'll get off on probation . SHOPLIFTER I did n't need it . I did n't ever like it . Crazy ! A burst of song offstage : an overmellow baritone pouring out Canio 's heartbreak from I Pagliacci , making up in vigor all that it lacks in sweetness : " Ma il vizio alberga sol ne l ' alma tua negletta . " The SHOPLIFTER , puzzled , glances about , hunches her shoulders at DAKIS inquisitively , but he is absorbed in his work and he does not even glance up . The singing comes closer . More heartbreak ! " Tu viscere non hai sol legge . " Enter Gus KEOGH , a uniformed policeman with a normally smiling , smooth , white Irish face , twisted for the moment with the agony of the tragic song he is pouring forth . GUS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beaming . Got any 61 's ? DETECTIVE GALLAGHER A couple : You 're off-key today , Gus . Hands him several slips . KEOGH studies them ; his face contorts again with the emotion of the song as he goes off . p. 6 GUS KEOGH " vo ' ne lo sprezzo mio schiacciarti "  --  And fades off down the hall with a sob .  --  " sotto pi . " DETECTIVE NICHOLAS DAKIS rises , crosses to fingerprint board , rolls ink on pad , beckons to the SHOPLIFTER:Come here ! The SHOPLIFTER crosses to DAKIS . He takes her hand . She stiffens . He reassures her gently  --  in the interests of efficiency.Take it easy , girlie . Let me do the work . You just supply the finger . SHOPLIFTER Ooh ! ! DETECTIVE NICHOLAS DAKIS This finger . Relax , now , I 'm not going to hurt you . Just r-r-r-roll it . He presses her finger down on the sheet . DETECTIVE GALLAGHER glances up , toward door into hallway at someone approaching:Uh , uh ! Here comes trouble . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glances at the calendar on the wall:A full moon tonight . DETECTIVE GALLAGHER groans:It never fails . Enter an elderly , aristocratic-looking woman , dressed in the style of a bygone era . GALLAGHER , rises gallantly.Come in , Mrs. Farragut ! Are those people still bothering you ? p. 7 MRS . FARRAGUT Worse than ever , Officer . If I had n't awakened last night and smelled that gas coming through the walls , I 'd be gone  --  we 'd all be gone . DETECTIVE GALLAGHER solicitously:Have a chair . MRS . FARRAGUT Why have n't you given me protection ? I demand protection . DETECTIVE GALLAGHER conning her:I got twelve men on duty guarding you . MRS . FARRAGUT But whose side are they really on ? Are you sure you can trust them ? DETECTIVE GALLAGHER wounded:Mrs . Farragut ! One of them is my own brother . MRS . FARRAGUT Oh , I 'm sorry ! I did n't mean to offend you . She sits , leans toward him , confidentially . Only it 's so important . You see , they know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sagely . They 're making them  --  these foreigners next door and they blow this atomic vapor through the wall at me . And they have a man watching me from the top of the Empire State Building with radar . DETECTIVE GALLAGHER That man we got covered . MRS . FARRAGUT You have ? p. 8 DETECTIVE GALLAGHER Day and night . MRS . FARRAGUT Does the president know about this ? DETECTIVE GALLAGHER I talked to him only an hour ago . MRS . FARRAGUT That 's important , very important . These foreigners know I have electronic vision . I can see everything around us vibrating with electricity . Billions of atoms like stars in a universe , turning , vibrating , vibrating . Out there in the streets ten million living dynamos  --  coming and going . They create crosscurrents ; and those great tall skyscrapers draw all this human electricity to the top of the Empire State Building , where that man sits , and he turns it back and shoots it down on us . It 's a terrifying situation terrifying ! ! Do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! She rises , having worked herself into a frenzy of terror . JOE FEINSON , police reporter , enters , leans his head on the rail watching ; a tiny man , a few inches more than five feet , exaggerated nose , crooked features , JOE 's superficially wisecracking police-reporter attitude is only the persona with which he cloaks a genuine , philosophic , humanistic outlook . Nothing escapes his humorous , beady , birdlike eyes . DETECTIVE GALLAGHER rises , crosses around to her , takes her arm reassuringly:Now , Mrs. Farragut , I 'm watching it , every second ; and I got it all under control . Tell you what  --  I 'm going to double the men I got guarding you . Twenty-five picked men day and night . How 's that ? p. 9 MRS . FARRAGUT calms down:Oh , that 's better . Much better . Thank you . Exit MRS . FARRAGUT . DETECTIVE GALLAGHER plucking at his damp shirt:Get out the butterfly net . JOE FEINSON You give the customers a good massage . DETECTIVE GALLAGHER Hell , this job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingerprints:O.K. , girlie , wash your hands . In there ! He points to the washroom door . The SHOPLIFTER crosses to the washroom , dangling her lamp-blacked fingers before her so as not to soil her dress . JOE FEINSON What 's new ? DETECTIVE GALLAGHER It 's quiet . Knocks wood . JOE FEINSON The town 's dead as Kelcey 's . He saunters over to GALLAGHER 'S desk . SHOPLIFTER opens the door , frowning , calls out:There is n't any lock on the door . DETECTIVE NICHOLAS DAKIS Just wash your hands , girlie . SHOPLIFTER indignant:A fine howdoyoudo ! She slams the door . p. 10 JOE FEINSON Story for me ? DETECTIVE GALLAGHER No . Shoplifter . JOE FEINSON She anybody ? DETECTIVE GALLAGHER Nobody at all . JOE FEINSON Any angles ? DETECTIVE GALLAGHER Nah ! Just a slob . Two detectives enter . One of them , CALLAHAN , is very exuberant and high-spirited , Tenth Avenue in his speech , dressed in a yellow polo shirt and baggy , trousers , which do not match his wrinkled jacket . The other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neatly dressed , soft-spoken . DETECTIVE CALLAHAN tears off his jacket , revealing the full splendor of his polo shirt-Hawaiian in motif , with brilliant foliage woven into the pattern:Hi , Tom , Nick , Joe ! Phew , it 's hot out ! Sweat your kolonjas off ! JOE FEINSON What the hell are you dressed up for ? Must be Halloween ? DETECTIVE CALLAHAN I wonder what he means ? DETECTIVE O'BRIEN Saks Fifth Avenue pays Mike to advertise their clothes . DETECTIVE CALLAHAN Geeze , were we given a run around ! We tailed a guy for two hours , from Fifty-thoid to Ninety-foist and back . I thought for sure , " This one belongs to us. " p. 11 DETECTIVE O'BRIEN Looked like a good man . DETECTIVE CALLAHAN Then the jerko took a bus . Glances at the schedule hanging on the wall.Moider ! Sunday again ! What the hell am I ?  --  a Sunday detective ? My kids 'll grow up , they wo n't even know me . To JOE . Say , Joe , there 's a big story on Thoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOE FEINSON No , what about it ? DETECTIVE CALLAHAN A brewery truck backed up into the sidewalk , and a barrel of beer fell right out inna baby carriage . JOE FEINSON rising:Was the baby in it ? DETECTIVE CALLAHAN Yeah . JOE FEINSON Was it killed ? DETECTIVE CALLAHAN No , it was light beer ! Boyeeng ! He doubles over , holding his sides with laughter.Ha , ha , ha ! JOE FEINSON groans and sinks back into his chair:You 're a cute kid . What 's your name , Berle ? The SHOPLIFTER returns from the washroom . As she crosses , CALLAHAN studies her face , squinting his eyes professionally . DETECTIVE O'BRIEN Busy day ? p. 12 DETECTIVE GALLAGHER Quiet . DETECTIVE O'BRIEN Good . He knocks wood . DETECTIVE GALLAGHER Too quiet . DETECTIVE O'BRIEN We 're due . We 're ripe for a homicide . DETECTIVE GALLAGHER Ssh . Wait till I get out of here . The desk phone rings , GALLAGHER groans . Ca n't you keep your big mouth shut ? He picks up the receiver.21st Squad Detectives , Gallagher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Now what is it you lost ? JOE FEINSON Her virginity . DETECTIVE GALLAGHER In a taxicab ? JOE FEINSON Hell of a place ! DETECTIVE GALLAGHER Did you get his number ? Can you describe it ? JOE FEINSON This is going to be educational . DETECTIVE GALLAGHER What 's your name ? Address ? Yes , Madame . I 'll check that for you . Not at all . Simultaneously JOE FEINSON I got a squeal for you . I lost something . My manhood . DETECTIVE CALLAHAN We do n't take cases that old , Joe . p. 13 DETECTIVE GALLAGHER hanging up:Outlawed by the statute of limitations . DETECTIVE LOT BRODY enters with several containers of coffee , Coca-Colas , and a bag of sandwiches . BRODY is a huge man , deceptively obese and clumsy in appearance ; bald-headed , ugly , carbuncled face , lit up , however , by sad ; soft , gentle eyes . He hands one bag to DAKIS . DETECTIVE LOU BRODY Here you are , Nick ! DETECTIVE NICHOLAS DAKIS I appreciate that . DETECTIVE LOU BRODY My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian Dressing ? Standing up , searching in her purse . DETECTIVE LOU BRODY They ran out . He crosses , places the remaining sandwiches and coffee on the long table , then goes into the LIEUTENANT 'S office , hangs his hat and jacket on the coat-tree . SHOPLIFTER How much do I owe you ? DETECTIVE NICHOLAS DAKIS It 's on the house . SHOPLIFTER You 're all awful decent , really , awful decent . DETECTIVE NICHOLAS DAKIS Well , you did n't kill anyone . A man carrying a briefcase enters , stands at the gate a moment , taps on it impatiently . He is about thirty-five , erect in bearing , sharply chiseled features , self-possessed , apparently immune to the heat ; he is crisp and cool , even to the starched collar . When he speaks , his voice is equally crisp and starched , and carries considerable authority . p. 14 DETECTIVE GALLAGHER Yes , sir ? The man fishes a card out of his wallet and presents it . ENDICOTT SIMS My name is Sims , Endicott Sims . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Counselor ? ENDICOTT SIMS I represent Mr. Kurt Schneider . Your office has a warrant out for him ?

ENDICOTT SIMS First , however , I have here some photographs . He takes some pictures from his briefcase , and hands them to BRODY.He had these taken half an hour ago . DETECTIVE LOU BRODY examines them , makes a face:Nudes ? Ugly , ai n't he ? ENDICOTT SIMS smiles wryly:He 's no Mr. America . p. 15 DETECTIVE LOU BRODY No , that he ai n't . ENDICOTT SIMS The purpose is not aesthetic . I do n't want any rubber hoses used on him . DETECTIVE LOU BRODY Counselor , how long have you been practicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SIMS Who 's handling this case here ? DETECTIVE LOU BRODY My partner . ENDICOTT SIMS A man named James McLeod ? DETECTIVE LOU BRODY Yeah . ENDICOTT SIMS I 've heard a good deal about him . A law unto himself . You will please tell him for me DETECTIVE LOU BRODY Wait a minute . Tell him for yourself . Here he is . JAMES McLEOD enters , his big hand gripping the arm of a stunned , sensitive-looking young man , whom he guides into the room . JAMES McLEOD is tall , lean , handsome , has powerful shoulders , uncompromising mouth , a studied , immobile , masklike facies , betrayed by the deep-set , impatient , mocking eyes , which reveal the quick flickers of mood , the deep passions of the man possessed by his own demon DETECTIVE LOU BRODY Oh , Jim , this is your squeal . To SIMS.This is Detective McLeod , Mr. Sims . p. 16 DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD How do you do , sir ? Takes out a handkerchief , mops his brow , wipes the sweatband of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOU BRODY Mr. Sims is an attorney . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD And very clever . I 've seen him in court .

To SIMS.I had the pleasure of arresting your client a year ago . ENDICOTT SIMS So I am informed . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD He 's changed his lawyer since , if not his business . ENDICOTT SIMS Kurt Schneider is a successful truck farmer from New Jersey . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD With a little abortion mill in New York for a sideline .

BRODY hands the photographs to McLEOD. p. 17 DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD looks at the pictures , grimaces:There 's no doubt the process of evolution is beginning to reverse itself . ENDICOTT SIMS You understand , Officer , that my client has certain rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respected . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD urbanely:One second , Counselor . I 'll be right with you .

DETECTIVE GALLAGHER Twenty minutes ago . The phone rings.21st Squad Detectives , Gallagher . Yes , sir . He hands the phone to McLEOD.The Lieutenant . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD takes the phone and it is evident from his grimace at the phone that he has no great love for his LIEUTENANT . He sits on the desk:Yes , Lieutenant ? I just got back . p. 18 JOE FEINSON crosses down , drapes himself on the chair next to McLEOD:Hiya , Seamus ! DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD smothers the mouthpiece of the phone , murmurs quickly:Oh , Yussel , Yussel ! You 're supposed to be an intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

Grrrim grray prrrison walls ! Wish you 'd have seen Langdon in the bull pen . " Yiha , Jack ! Yiya , Charley ! " Smiling . He was happy ! He was home again ! On phone.Yes , Lieutenant .

A fox with rabies bit him in the ass when he was two years old , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He goes rabid ! DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD hangs up , pulls JOE 'S bow tie:You apple-headed member of the fourth estate , to look natural you should have a knife and fork sticking out of the top of your head . City College is going to be proud of you yet ! Rises , talks Yiddish . Mir daft ihr dihagginun ! JOE FEINSON laughs , ties his tie:Is this story worth a picture ? DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD Mm possibly . To ARTHUR.Do n't try running for it , Buster . You 'd just about reach that door and suddenly you 'd put on weight . Bullets are supersonic . ARTHUR KINDRED Do n't worry . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD I wo n't . Either way . BRODY , at the sound of the young man 's voice , stops and turns quickly . He comes over , scrutinizes the young man 's face . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD Know him ? DETECTIVE LOU BRODY No . No . I Shakes his head . p. 20 DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD calls across the room to MR . SIMS : One second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes face-to-face with CALLAHAN . He pauses to survey CALLAHAN 'S sartorial splendor . Shakes his head.Strictly Pier 6 !

Goes into LIEUTENANT 'S office , closes the door , dials a number . DETECTIVE CALLAHAN miffed:Remind me to get that college graduate a bicycle pump for Christmas to blow up that big head of his . O'BRIEN and GALLAGHER laugh . DETECTIVE O'BRIEN He needling you again ? DETECTIVE CALLAHAN Mm ! Big needle-man from sew-and-sew . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD on the phone: Hello , darling . His voice at once takes on warmth and tenderness ; his eyes , his smile , his whole being seem to undergo a metamorphosis.What did the doctor say ? Thank God ! Nothing organic ? Sure , now , Mary ? How does he explain those palpitations ? Psychosomatic ? Mm ! And how does he explain that ? What tensions ? Laughs.What 'd he prescribe , short of a new world ? Phenobarbital and Vitamin B1 ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're wonderful ! I love you ! Of course , I was worried sick.Mm . Yes . Thank you , my angel . I 'll call you later . Good-bye . In the squad room , ARTHUR 'S face turns gray ; he clutches his stomach and bites his lip . BRODY , who has been studying him , crosses to him . p. 21 DETECTIVE LOU BRODY What 's the matter , sonny ? ARTHUR KINDRED Nothing . BRODY points to the washroom . ARTHUR crosses to it , quickly . Once inside , alone , his bravado falls away . He is a sick and desperate boy . He dryretches over the sink for a moment . Breathing heavily , he looks about in sudden panic . BRODY glances toward the washroom , goes to his files , takes out a bottle , goes to the washroom , props open the door , stands there , watching . ARTHUR controls himself , turns on the water in the sink , buries his face in it . BRODY takes a paper cup , pours out a drink , offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks . Dries his face . BRODY tosses off the drink , himself . They return to the squadroom . The desk phone rings . GALLAGHER reaches for it . DETECTIVE LOU BRODY glances at the clock:O.K. , Tom . I 'll take over now .

ENDICOTT SIMS presents him with the photographs again:You will observe there are no scars or lacerations of any kind ! Points to photos.This is the way I 'm delivering my client to you , and this is the way I want him back . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD studies them gravely:I should think that any change whatsoever would be an improvement , Counselor . ENDICOTT SIMS I want you to know I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're not to abuse him physically or degrade his dignity as a human being , do you understand ? DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD bites this off sharply:Counselor , I never met a criminal yet who did n't wrap himself in the Constitution from head to toe , or a hoodlum who was n't filled to the nostrils with habeas corpus and the rights of human dignity . Did you ever see the girl your client operated on last year  --  in the morgue  --  on a marble slab ? Was n't much human left of her , Counselor  --  and very little dignity ! ENDICOTT SIMS My client was innocent of that charge . The court acquitted him . p. 23 DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD He was guilty . ENDICOTT SIMS Are you setting yourself above the courts of the land ? DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD There 's a higher court , Counselor . ENDICOTT SIMS I 'm sure there is , Officer . Are you qualified to speak for it ? I 'm not . God does n't come down and whisper in my ear . But when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I obey it , and I respect it . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD What do you want to do ?  --  Try the case here ? This is n't a court . Save it for the judge . Now , Counselor , I 'm busy . Your client will be treated with as much delicacy as he is entitled to . So bring him in  --  or get off the pot . ENDICOTT SIMS I 've heard about you . You 're quite an anomaly , McLeod , quite an anomaly . It 's going to be a real pleasure to examine you on the witness stand . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD Anything to give you a thrill , Counselor . ENDICOTT SIMS We may have a thrill or two in store for you . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD Meaning ? ENDICOTT SIMS For over a year you personally have been making my client 's life a living hell . Why ? p. 24 DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD I beg your pardon . ENDICOTT SIMS Why ?

Forget it . It 's fixed . Crosses to get DAKIS 'S ticket . p. 28 DETECTIVE O'BRIEN You frighten him ? JOE FEINSON I frightened myself . Holds up his trembling hand . Look at my hand ! Shaking ! DAKIS laughs  --  a bellow that makes the room vibrate . DETECTIVE CALLAHAN A cop 's got to get a reporter to fix a ticket for him . I seen everything now . JOE FEINSON That 's the way it should be . A free press is the tocsin of a free people . The law keeps you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people keep us in line , you keep the people in line . Everybody kicks everybody else in the ass !

Here comes trouble ! A couple of customers . A uniformed POLICEMAN , Negro , enters , herding in front of him two burglars handcuffed to each other . They are followed by other POLICEMEN , a HYSTERICAL WOMAN , and , at the tail of the parade , WILLY , the janitor , with broom , pail , and inquisitive look . The Negro policeman , BARNES , is a big man of erect carriage , with a fine , intelligent face . The two burglars are a study in contrasting personalities . The first burglar , CHARLEY , is nervous , thin , short , wiry , with long expressive hands that are never still , forever weaving in and out . He has jet-black hair , which keeps falling over his forehead in bangs , tiny black eyes , an olive complexion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his innocence with percussive indignation . He is wearing an expensive suit and a pink shirt with no tie . The second burglar , LEWIS , is a chunky , sandy-haired young fellow , slow-moving , slower-thinking , who is inclined to take this arrest as a minor nuisance at worst . He is wearing a " zoot suit " with extremely narrow cuffs on the trousers . He moves slouching slowly , swaying from side to side . There is something " off-beat , " something disturbing about both these men . WILLY , the janitor , is a thin , sour , grizzled man with a pockmarked face and a moth-eaten toothbrush moustache . He wears a worn black shirt and old , torn trousers . The HYSTERICAL WOMAN is a short , dumpy , elderly Frenchwoman , whose hair is in disarray and whose slip is showing . She is wringing her hands , crying and gabbling half in French , half in English . As they enter , they are all talking at once . CHARLEY 'S percussive cries and the WOMAN 's wails dominate the hubbub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squad room . p. 35 DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD What have you got there ? BARNES Burglars .

BARNES I was right across the street when I heard her scream . They come running down the stairs . I collared them . This one put up a struggle . CHARLEY screaming:I was walkin ' down the stairs mindin ' my own business  --  the cop jumps on me and starts beatin ' the crap outa me . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD roars:All right ! CHARLEY stops screaming , pantomimes his innocence . We 'll come to you . He takes his revolver out of his holster , puts it in his pocket . BRODY takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DAKIS does likewise .

You 're all right , now . Sit down , Madame . I 'll get you a glass of water . HYSTERICAL WOMAN Oh , please , please ! MCLEOD crosses to the watercooler . DETECTIVE LOU BRODY searches LEWIS:You 're a bad boy , Lewis , and what 's more you 're a bad thief . Do n't you know a good thief never carries a loaded pistol ? It means five years added to your sentence , Lewis . LEWIS ABBOTT I 'd never use it . DETECTIVE LOU BRODY That 's what you think , Lewis . But it 'd happen . You 're lucky you were picked up . Probably saved you from a murder rap . Just once you 'd walk in , a woman , she 'd scream , resist , you 'd get scared DETECTIVE CALLAHAN Boom ! Boom !

DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD rising nervously , moving above the desk and down to KURT:Hold your hats , boys , here we go again . Looking down on KURT from behind him , murmurs softly.You 're lucky , Kurt . You got away with it once . But the postman rings twice . And this time we 've got you , Kurt . Why do n't you cop a plea ? Miss Harris is waiting for you . We 're going to visit her in the hospital . She 's anxious to see you . And what you do n't know is there was a corroborating witness , and she 's downstairs , ready to identify you , right now . You 're getting pale , Kurt . KURT laughs softly to himself.What are you laughing at ? p. 61 KURT SCHNEIDER Nothing . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD That 's right ! That 's just what you 've got to laugh about  --  nothing . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe I am . Maybe I 'm not . Maybe somebody else is . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD What 's that mean ? KURT SCHNEIDER I know why you 're out to get me .

That 's all I 'm obliged to say by law . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD You should have been a lawyer , Kurt . A Philadelphia lawyer . Crosses to the rail , shouts downstairs . Lineup , Gus ! Gus , offstage , shouts up : " Coming ! " He can be heard approaching singing the melody of " The Rose of Tralee . " DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD to DAKIS:Nick , put on your hat and coat for a lineup . BRODY crosses down to ARTHUR again . ARTHUR hands him the glass . ARTHUR KINDRED Thanks . A pause . As BRODY looks at the boy , something of agony creeps into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the navy , too . The Juneau . Know her ? ARTHUR KINDRED She was a cruiser . DETECTIVE LOU BRODY Yeah . ARTHUR KINDRED Did n't she go down with all hands ? In the Pacific ? DETECTIVE LOU BRODY There were ten survivors . He was n't one of them . ARTHUR KINDRED Too bad . DETECTIVE LOU BRODY Yeah ! He was my only boy . It 's something you never get over . You never believe it . You keep waiting for a bell to ring phone door . Sometimes I hear a voice on the street , or see a young fellow from the back , the set of his shoulders  --  like you  --  for a minute it 's him . Your whole life becomes like a dream a walking dream . ARTHUR KINDRED Maybe he was one of the lucky ones . DETECTIVE LOU BRODY Do n't say that ! ARTHUR KINDRED Why not ? DETECTIVE LOU BRODY Because it would n't make sense then . ARTHUR KINDRED Does it ? DETECTIVE LOU BRODY fiercely:Yes , damn it ! Yes . p. 63 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your hat and coat for a lineup ?

She obeys . He steps on it.You have your instructions ? MISS HATCH Yeah . I look at them all , then touch the one on the shoulder . He nods . She walks slowly down the line , nervously scrutinizing the faces , a little too quickly to be convincing . She turns to MCLEOD.He is n't here . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD You have n't looked . MISS HATCH I looked . Of course I did . DETECTIVE CALLAHAN It 's the new look . p. 65 DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD Just look , will you . Not at me . Over there .

DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD You 're fresh ! Phone rings . BRODY answers it . DETECTIVE LOU BRODY 2-1 Squad . Brody . Conversation sotto voce . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD I 've a good mind to prefer charges against you . MISS HATCH screams at him:That 's what I get for coming all the way downtown to help you . You cops are all the same . Give you a badge and you think you can push the world around . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD You identified one of these men . Now point him out or I 'm going to throw you in the clink. p. 66 MISS HATCH You 'll do what ? BRODY hangs up the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim ! DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD Yes ? DETECTIVE LOU BRODY in subdued tones:That was the D.A . ' s office . The Harris girl died . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD When ? DETECTIVE LOU BRODY A couple of hours ago .

The girl died . Sit down over there , Kurt . All right , Miss Hatch . You 've earned your fur piece . I hope you 'll enjoy it . MISS HATCH flaring:You ca n't talk to me that way . I 'm no tramp that you can talk to me that way . Who the hell do you think you are , anyway ? p. 67 DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost ! MISS HATCH exits , murmuring:Big cheese ! See my lawyer about him . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD All right , men , thank you . As they go , we hear snatches of the following conversations from the men . GUS KEOGH I was waiting for her to put the finger on you , boy . DETECTIVE NICHOLAS DAKIS Me ? Do I look like an ice-tong man ? DETECTIVE O'BRIEN Regular Sarah Heartburn . DETECTIVE CALLAHAN One minute more we 'd have gotten the witches ' scene from Mac-beth . Exit . WILLY , the janitor , has entered during the above . WILLY sweeping vigorously , muttering all the while:Now look at this joint , will you ? You filthy slobs . You live in a stable . To SHOPLIFTER.Come on , get up . She rises . He sweeps right through her.Would n't think I swept it out an hour ago . Boy , I 'd like to see the homes you bums live in . Pigpens , I bet . Exit . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD crosses up to the duty chart , takes it off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmuring for JOE 'S benefit:Why am I wasting my life here ? I could make more driving a hack . I like books , I like music , I 've got a wonderful , wonderful wife  --  I could get a dozen jobs would give me more time to enjoy the good things of life . I should have my head examined . All this work , these hours ! What for ? It 's a phony . He removes the letters spelling out GALLAGHER and DAKIS , places them in the drawer , takes out other letters , inserts his name and BRODY'S. p. 68 JOE FEINSON comes down:Was she reached , you think ? DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD What do you think ? JOE FEINSON I do n't know . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD groans:Oh , Yussel . JOE FEINSON I do n't know . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD This is a phony . The thieves and murderers could have written the penal code themselves . Your democracy , Yussel , is a Rube Goldberg contraption . An elaborate machine a block long  --  you set it all in motion , 3,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , replaces the chart on the wall . JOE FEINSON That 's what 's great about it . That 's what I love . It 's so confused , it 's wonderful . Crosses to MCLEOD.After all , Seamus , guilt and innocence !  --  The epistemological question ! Just the knowing the mere knowing the ability to ken . Maybe he did n't do it . Maybe she ca n't identify him . How do you know ? BRODY enters , sits at desk . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD How do you know anything ? You 've got a nose , you can smell ; you 've got taste buds , you can taste ; you 've got nerve endings , you can feel ; and , theoretically , you 've got intelligence you can judge . p. 69 JOE FEINSON Ah , ha ! That 's where it breaks down ! DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD to BRODY:Got an aspirin ? BRODY hands him a box of aspirin , MCLEOD takes the box and crosses over into the LIEUTENANT 'S office . JOE follows him . JOE FEINSON I was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench last year , Seamus . Twenty-nine years a successful lawyer . He thought this would be a cinch . He 's lost forty pounds . He 's nervous as a cat . His wife thinks he has a mistress . He has :  --  The Law . He said to me , " Joe ! I 've got to sentence a man to death tomorrow . How can I do it ? Who am I to judge ? It takes a god to know !  --  To really know ! " DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD in LIEUTENANT 'S office , draws a glass of water , tosses the aspirin into his mouth:Bunk ! JOE FEINSON I 'm quoting Judge Mendez . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD Then he 's a corrupt man , himself . All lawyers are , anyway . I say hang all the lawyers , and let justice triumph . Washes down the aspirin with a drink , sits , takes off his tie , rolls up his sleeve , then slowly , with mounting bitterness.Evil has a stench of its own . A child can spot it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them . No good he was possessed . Every day and every night of my childhood I saw and heard him abuse and maliciously torment my mother . I saw that sadistic son-of-a-bitch of a father of mine with that criminal mind of his drive my mother straight into a lunatic asylum . She died in a lunatic asylum . He controls himself.Yes , I know it when I smell it . I learned it early and deep . I was fourteen and alone in the world . I made war on it . Every time I look at one of these babies , I see my father 's face ! Phone rings in the outer office . BRODY answers . p. 70 DETECTIVE LOU BRODY 2-1 Squad . Brody . Pause.Lock the door . Do n't let him out ! I 'll be right over . Hangs up , rushes into the inner office , grabs his hat and coat.Say , Jim , there 's a guy at O'Donovan 's bar with a badge and gun , arresting a woman . Claims he 's a cop . Might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right back . Catch the phone for me ! Takes his gun out of the drawer and runs off . JOE FEINSON runs after him:Could be some shooting . Wait for me , baby ! Exit . MCLEOD comes out of LIEUTENANT 'S office , his face grim , black , the veins in his temple standing out . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD to KURT:You 're a lucky man , Kurt . Kissed in your cradle by a vulture . So the girl died , Kurt . KURT SCHNEIDER That 's too bad . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD What have you got , Kurt , in place of a conscience ? KURT starts to speak.Do n't answer !  --  I know  --  a lawyer . I ought to fall on you like the sword of God . KURT SCHNEIDER That sword 's got two edges . You could cut your own throat . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD takes out a cigarette , turns away to light it , his face twitching neurotically:Look ! The gate 's open ! While I 'm lighting my cigarette  --  why do n't you run for it ? One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 71 KURT SCHNEIDER I 'll go free , anyway . Why should I run ? DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD Give me the little pleasure  --  Touching his gun .  --  of putting a hole in the back of your head . KURT SCHNEIDER You would n't do that . Talk ! DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD Is it ? KURT SCHNEIDER You 're an intelligent man . You 're not foolish . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD Try me , Kurt . Why do n't you ? Go ahead , dance down that hall ! KURT SCHNEIDER smiles and shakes his head:Soon as you book me , I 'm out on bail . When I go to trial , they could n't convict me in a million years . You know that . Even if I were guilty , which I 'm not . The girl is dead . There are no witnesses . That 's the law . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD You 've been well briefed . You know your catechism . KURT SCHNEIDER I know more than my catechism ! DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD What , for example ? KURT smiles and nods.What , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wonder ! KURT is silent.On your feet ! KURT looks up at MCLEOD 'S face , is frightened by its almost insane intensity . MCLEOD roars at him . Get up ! ! KURT rises . Go in there ! Points to the LIEUTENANT 'S office . KURT goes into the LIEUTENANT 'S office . MCLEOD follows him , shuts the door . Sit down , Kurt . KURT sits.I 'm going to give you a piece of advice . When the courts and the juries and the judges let you free this time , get out of New York . Go to Georgia . They wo n't extradite criminals to us . So , you see , Kurt take my advice , go to Georgia , or go to hell , but you butcher one more girl in this city , and law or no law , I 'll find you and I 'll put a bullet in the back of your head , and I 'll drop your body in the East River , and I 'll go home and I 'll sleep sweetly . p. 72 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as I. You do n't frighten me . Now , I 'll give you some advice . I 've got plenty on you , too . I know why you 're so vindictive . And you watch your step ! Because I happen to have friends , too , downtown with pull , lots of pull ! DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD Have you ? What do you know ? Are n't you the big shot ! Pull ! Have you got any friends with push ! Like that ! Kicks him ; KURT goes over , chair and all . KURT SCHNEIDER Cut that out ! You let me alone now . MCLEOD grabs him by the lapels , pulls him to his feet.You let me go ! Let me go ! DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD No , Kurt ! Everybody else is going to let you go . You got it all figured exactly . The courts , the juries , the judges  --  He slaps him .  --  Everybody except me . He slaps him again . KURT starts to resist , growls , and tries to push MCLEOD away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the floor . MCLEOD 'S rage subsides . He sighs , disgusted with himself for losing his temper.Why did n't you obey your lawyer and keep your mouth shut ? All right ! Get up , Kurt ! Come on ! Get up ! KURT SCHNEIDER moaning and writhing:I ca n't I ca n't . Something inside broke ! He calls feebly.Help ! He screams.Help ! p. 73 DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD Get up ! You 're all right . Get up ! KURT 'S eyes roll up , exposing the whites . LIEUTENANT MONOGHAN enters quickly , wiping shaving lather off his face with a towel . LT . MONOGHAN What 's going on ? He sees KURT , goes to him , bends down . KURT SCHNEIDER Inside ! It broke . He hurt me . DAKIS rushes in . LT . MONOGHAN Take it easy , son , you 'll be all right . KURT SCHNEIDER I feel terrible . LT . MONOGHAN Nick ! Quick ! Get an ambulance . DETECTIVE NICHOLAS DAKIS Yes , sir . Goes to the phone , puts in a call . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the double . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD No . LT . MONOGHAN No ? You lunatic ! Did n't I just get through warning you ? To KURT who is on the floor , moaning in agony.What happened ? KURT SCHNEIDER gasping for breath:He tried to kill me ! p. 74 LT . MONOGHAN Why should he do that ? KURT SCHNEIDER Tami Giacoppetti ! Same thing ! She got him after me too . Tami Giacoppetti KURT 'S mouth opens and closes with scarcely any further sound emerging . LT . MONOGHAN What ? Tami Giacoppetti ? Who 's he ? What about him ? Puts his ear to KURT 'S mouth.A little louder ! Just try and talk a little louder , lad . KURT 'S eyes close , his head falls back . To GALLAGHER.Wet some towels ! GALLAGHER rushes to the washroom . DAKIS loosens KURT 'S collar , tries to restore him to consciousness . The LIEUTENANT rises , confronts MCLEOD , glaring at him.Who 's Tami Giacoppetti ? DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD I 've no idea . LT . MONOGHAN What 's the pitch here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got fresh . He begged for it , and I let him have it . That 's all . GALLAGHER returns with several wet towels . DAKIS takes them from him , applies them to KURT 'S head . LT . MONOGHAN Do n't con me ! That ai n't all . Come on ! Let 's have it ! What about this Tami Giacoppetti ? DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD I never heard of him . p. 75 DETECTIVE GALLAGHER Giacoppetti ? I know him . A black-market guy . Runs a creep joint in the Village . KURT groans . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD He 's putting on an act , Lieutenant . Ca n't you see KURT groans . LT . MONOGHAN This could be a very hot potato . If this man 's hurt , the big brass 'll be down here throwin ' questions at me . And I 'm going to have the answers . What plays between you two guys ? What 's he got on you ? What 's the clout ? DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD Nothing . LT . MONOGHAN Then what was his mouthpiece yellin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herring . Red , red herring ! LT . MONOGHAN That I 'm gon na goddamn well find out for myself . There 's something kinky about this . McLeod , if you 're concealing something from me , I 'll have your head on a plate . To GALLAGHER . This Giacoppetti ! Find him and bring him in ! DETECTIVE GALLAGHER Yes , sir . Goes . LT . MONOGHAN calls after him:My car 's downstairs . Use it . DETECTIVE GALLAGHER Yes , sir . The LIEUTENANT bends down to KURT . MCLEOD , grim-faced , lights another cigarette. @x The scene is the same , fifty-four minutes later by the clock on the wall . At rise , the lawyer , ENDICOTT SIMS , is closeted in the LIEUTENANT 'S office , scolding the LIEUTENANT and MCLEOD . In the squad room the SHOPLIFTER is reading the comics . ARTHUR is seated quietly , his head bowed in thought . DAKIS , the JANITOR , and GUS are in a huddle , whispering , glancing over toward the LIEUTENANT 'S door . BRODY is talking sotto voce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a tough-looking specimen . The setting sun is throwing long and ominous shadows into the darkening room . ENDICOTT SIMS fulminating at MCLEOD , who pointedly ignores him by focusing attention on a hangnail:How dare you take the law in your own hands ? Who are you to constitute yourself a court of last appeal ? LT . MONOGHAN oil on the surging waters:Nah , Counselor The phone rings in the squad room . BRODY crosses to answer . DETECTIVE LOU BRODY 21st Squad , Detective Brody Yeah ! The hospital ! Yeah . How is he ? Jotting notation . ENDICOTT SIMS No , Lieutenant ! This is a felony . Wheels back to MCLEOD.I 'm going to press a felonious assault here . So help me , I 'm going to see you in jail ! p. 77 DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD calmly , biting the hangnail:On which side of the bars , Counselor ? ENDICOTT SIMS Be careful . I 'm an attorney and an officer of the court , and I do n't like that talk . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD I 'm an officer of the peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you mean by that ? DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD looks up , sharply:By that I mean collusion . Subornation of witnesses , Counselor . ENDICOTT SIMS What the devil are you talking about ? DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD I 'm charging you with subornation . ENDICOTT SIMS Your lips are blistering with lies . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD sardonically:Praise from an expert . I had a witness here today you bought off , Counselor . ENDICOTT SIMS That 's so absurd , I 'm not even going to answer it . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD I 'll prove it ! LT . MONOGHAN All right ! Cut it ! Cut it out . Enough 's enough . ENDICOTT SIMS to LIEUTENANT:I intend to carry this to the commissioner . p. 78 LT . MONOGHAN pushes the phone across the desk toward SIMS:Call him now . That 's your privilege . ENDICOTT SIMS And do n't think you 're entirely free of blame in this , Lieutenant . LT . MONOGHAN Me ? What have I ENDICOTT SIMS I warned you personal motives are involved in this case . I was afraid this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps to prevent it . Luckily , I came armed with photos and affidavits . LT . MONOGHAN Mystery ! Mystery ! What motives ? DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD rises:Yes . Why do n't you tell us ? Let 's get it out in the open ! What are these motives ? ENDICOTT SIMS It is not to my client 's interests to reveal them at this moment . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD Legal bull . LT . MONOGHAN I 'm beginning to think so , myself . ENDICOTT SIMS Sure . One hand washes the other . BRODY knocks at the door . LT . MONOGHAN Come in ! DETECTIVE LOU BRODY Phone , Lieutenant . p. 79 LT . MONOGHAN picks up the phone:21st Squad , Lieutenant Monoghan . Yeah . Yeah BRODY returns to the squad room , hangs up the phone . ENDICOTT SIMS softly , to MCLEOD:On what evidence do you make these serious charges ? DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD taunting him:The evidence of my intelligent observation . ENDICOTT SIMS Insufficient , incompetent , and irrelevant . LT . MONOGHAN looks up , annoyed:Sh ! Sh ! Turns back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , McLeod , but your tactics do n't fool me for a second . You 're not going to duck out of this so easily . You 're in a position of responsibility here , and you have to answer for your actions . You ca n't use your badge for personal vengeance . That does n't go . The public is n't your servant ; you 're theirs . You 're going to be broken for this . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD roaring back at him:Go ahead ! Break me ! You 're worse than the criminals you represent , Counselor . You 're so damn respectable . Yet , look at you ! The clothes you wear , your car downstairs , your house in Westchester , all bought with stolen money , tainted with blood . p. 80 LT . MONOGHAN Shut up ! I got the hospital . ENDICOTT SIMS How is he ? They listen attentively . LT . MONOGHAN on phone:Yes . Yes . I see . Keep in touch with me . Let me know right away . Hangs up . See , Counselor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no external lacerations on your client that would warrant a felony assault . They 're now making X-rays and tests to see if there are any internal injuries . So far you have n't got a leg to stand on . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD Let him , let him ! To SIMS . Bring your felony charge . It 'll give me a chance to get your client on the stand and really tear his clothes off . And yours , too , Counselor . LT . MONOGHAN McLeod ! Step outside ! MCLEOD crosses out of the LIEUTENANT 's office , shuts the door . DETECTIVE LOU BRODY murmurs to MCLEOD:What 's the score ? DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD Tempest in a teapot . Turns to his personal file . ENDICOTT SIMS What kind of an officer is that ? LT . MONOGHAN Detectives are like fingerprints . No two alike . He has his quoiks. p. 81 ENDICOTT SIMS The understatement of the year . LT . MONOGHAN We all got ' em . He has a value here . He 's honest . He ai n't on the take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no tin boxes . ENDICOTT SIMS I was n't saying he had . LT . MONOGHAN I thought you was , maybe . ENDICOTT SIMS No LT . MONOGHAN Then what was you saying ? I guess I fumbled it . ENDICOTT SIMS I ca n't discuss it with you . LT . MONOGHAN sarcastically:I 'd love to discuss it with someone . Who do you suggest ? ENDICOTT SIMS McLeod . LT . MONOGHAN Nah , Counselor ! ENDICOTT SIMS Or his wife ! LT . MONOGHAN looks up sharply:His wife ? What do you mean by that ? ENDICOTT SIMS Never mind ! Skip it ! LT . MONOGHAN You mentioned his wife . What do you mean by that ? Look ! I got to get a clear-up here . A little cooperation would go a long way . ENDICOTT SIMS When it serves my client 's interests not before . p. 82 LT . MONOGHAN Four years ago I threw my radio set the hell outta the window . You know why ? Because , goddamn it , I hate mysteries . ENDICOTT SIMS smiles , shakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet . Looks at his watch . Gouverneur Hospital ? LT . MONOGHAN Yeah . ENDICOTT SIMS I want to see my client . Will I be allowed in ? LT . MONOGHAN Yeah , yeah . ENDICOTT SIMS I 'll be back . He leaves the LIEUTENANT 'S office . In the squad room , he pauses to confront MCLEOD.I 'll be back . I 'm not through with you . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD I ca n't wait . Exit SIMS . DETECTIVE LOU BRODY to MCLEOD , indicating the tough , surly-looking character:This creep was impersonating an officer . MRS . FEENEY I did n't know . I thought he might be a policeman . His badge looked real . DETECTIVE LOU BRODY A shakedown . After he got you outside he 'd a taken all your money and let you go . You see , Mrs. Feeney , that 's how we get a bad reputation . Now you will appear in court in the morning , wo n't you ? p. 83 MRS . FEENEY Oh , yes . MR . FEENEY Tomorrow morning ? Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FEENEY You 'll explain to your boss . You 'll just take off , that 's all . MR . FEENEY But , Isabel MRS . FEENEY He 'll be there . Do n't you worry . Thank you . Thank you . They go off , arguing . DETECTIVE LOU BRODY to McLEOD:I 'm going down to book this crumb-bum . CRUMB-BUM aggressively : What did you call me ? DETECTIVE LOU BRODY A crumb-bum . Come on !

I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ask me to compromise for this kid ? Who the hell is he ? Now , right now , Lou , I 'm faced with a problem of my own that 's ripping me up like a .22 bullet bouncing around inside , and I ca n't compromise on that . So what do I do ? What do I do ? A long pause . JOE has entered quietly and has been standing in the doorway , listening . JOE FEINSON Try picking up that phone and calling her . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD Who ? JOE FEINSON Mary . Tosses an aspirin box onto the desk.Here 's your aspirin . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD What are you talking about ? JOE FEINSON This " .22 bullet " of yours .

DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD Was n't I entitled to know ? p. 162 MARY MCLEOD Yes , yes ! DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD Why did n't you tell me ? MARY MCLEOD Jim , I ca n't go over this again and again and again . I refuse to . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD If I did n't love you and need you so , it 'd be simple , you understand ? MARY MCLEOD I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wait till morning . MARY MCLEOD That wo n't help us . Please , I 'm so tired . Let me go now , Jim . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD To what ?

DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD Mary , I CALLAHAN enters the LIEUTENANT 's office , leaves paper on his desk , and goes.Mary , you just do n't stop loving someone . MARY MCLEOD I would n't have thought so . I would n't have believed it could happen . But , there it is . I suppose in this life we all die many times before they finally bury us . This was one of those deaths . Sudden , unexpected , like being run over by a bus . It happens . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD Who do you think you 're kidding ? MARY MCLEOD No one ! Begins to cry.Least of all , myself . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD takes her in his arms:Mary , I love you . MARY MCLEOD clinging to him , sobbing:Then help me ! I 'm trying to be a human being . I 'm trying to bundle myself together . It took every bit of strength to go this far . Help me , Jim ! p. 164 DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD caressing her:It 's no use , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go home if you were n't waiting for me with the radio going and the smell of coffee on the stove . I 'd blow out my brains . I would , Mary , if I went home to an empty flat  --  I would n't dare take my gun with me . He gives her his handkerchief . She dries her eyes.Now powder your nose ! Put on some lipstick . She kisses him . SIMS appears at the gate , outside . DETECTIVE CALLAHAN crosses to SIMS:Yes , Counselor ? ENDICOTT SIMS I want to see Detective McLeod . DETECTIVE CALLAHAN All right , Counselor . Come in . Knocks on the door . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD Come in ! DETECTIVE CALLAHAN Someone outside to see you . MARY MCLEOD I 'll go home now . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD No . Wait a minute . MARY MCLEOD smiling now:That taxi bill is going to break us . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD grins back at her:Let it break us . What do we care ? He goes off , sees SIMS , his face goes grim again . He crosses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was acting . p. 165 ENDICOTT SIMS He 's still in shock . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD He 'll be okay in the morning . ENDICOTT SIMS No thanks to you . When he 's brought back here tomorrow , though , he 'd better remain okay . This is not to happen again ! You 're not to lay a finger on him . If you do DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD Then advise him again to keep his mouth shut . And see that he does . ENDICOTT SIMS You 're lucky you 're not facing a murder charge yourself right now . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD I could always get you to defend me . ENDICOTT SIMS And I probably would . That 's my job , no matter how I feel personally . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD As long as you get your fee ? ENDICOTT SIMS I 've defended many men at my own expense . DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD That was very noble of you . ENDICOTT SIMS Nobility does n't enter into it . Every man has a right to counsel , no matter how guilty he might seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every man has a right not to be arbitrarily judged , particularly by men in authority ; not by you , not by the Congress , not even by the president of the United States . The theory being these human rights are derived from God himself . p. 166 DETECTIVE SEAMUS MCLEOD I know the theory , Counselor . ENDICOTT SIMS But you do n't go along with it ? Well , you 're not alone . There are others . You 've a lot of friends all over the world . Read the headlines . But do n't take it on yourself to settle it . Let history do that .
