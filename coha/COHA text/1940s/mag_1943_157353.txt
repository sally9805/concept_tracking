New York 's Daily News last week reported : " Hitler 's errand boy , General Francisco Franco , has taken out of the port of Philadelphia more than 200,000 gallons of high-grade petroleum products within the last week . " Standard Oil spokesmen said that permission for the shipment had come from the State Department . The State Department said that the permission was based on thorough consideration , added that the shipment ( in a Spanish vessel ) consisted of lubricating oil . <P> London 's Daily Telegraph reported : the Franco Government has notified U.S. Ambassador Carlton J. H. Hayes that it must have more aviation gasoline . If the U.S. failed to deliver , Spain would not permit Portuguese planes to use Tangier , the onetime North African international zone , which Spanish troops occupied in 1940 . Thus the only daily mail service linking London , Lisbon , Tangier and other African points would be severed .
