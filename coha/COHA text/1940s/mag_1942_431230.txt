What would Sue like while she is Win the hospital ? Flowers , I suppose . Or what ? " Well , there are other things , a lot of them apparently unknown to well-wishers . But let 's begin with flowers . If you 're sending flowers to the mother of a new baby , it 's often a good idea to wait until the week , after the baby 's arrival , when the lavish excitement of the first week has spent itself and the young mother feels more like enjoying her bouquets . The same rule applies , of course , to illness of any kind ? do n't waste your money sending flowers when the patient is too sick to enjoy them . What kind of flowers to send ? Well , if the patient is not likely to have a great many flowers , let yours be showy ones , bright and lasting , like gladioli and dahlias . For the popular darling who is sure to have a room like a garden , try sending a single fine gardenia or one superb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know the patient has a preference for them , avoid white flowers , which , unfortunately , have a funeral connotation for many people . Think twice before you choose lilies , which are a threat to the comfort of anyone who has sinus trouble . But why not try variations on the theme of sympathy ? Eau de cologne , which makes a pleasant addition to rubbing alcohol , gets an enthusiastic reception . So do a box of dusting powder , a few cakes of luxury soap , and the delightfully scented bath mitts that eliminate washcloths . Almost every patient enjoys receiving a bottle of fine port or sherry . Even if she does n't sip it herself , she will like the hospitable gesture it provides for calling hours . Between visitors she may like a game of solitaire . Patience cards , minikin size , are best suited to invalid hands . An atomizer full of perfume is a boon , too . A few squirts and the business of a surgical dressing is sooner forgotten . Three things that are godsends to a convalescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute madam is feeling better she wants to do a job on her face . Tweezing her eyebrows . Working out a new makeup . Give the girl a shaving mirror , a good-size one on an adjustable frame that will stand at a handy angle on her serving table . The second happy thought is a tiny down pillow , about four by eight inches , just the thing to tuck back of a tired neck , to rest an elbow on , to fill in the odd chinks and crannies that develop between body and mattress . The pillow should have a smooth , washable cover , linen or batiste . In fact , the ideal donor will send half a dozen covers along with the pillow . Third on my it's-about-time list is a reading lamp . For some curious reason most hospital rooms have either a glaring overhead light or a squat table lamp that gives a dull glow inadequate for reading . A good gooseneck reading lamp makes an ideal gift . What about food ? Fine , if the patient is not on a diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fruit ? the fruit usually spoils before it can be eaten . A tiny jar of pate de fois gras , a bit of caviar , portions of favorite cheeses , lobster paste , a series of once-only jars of marmalade , jelly , and honey for the breakfast or tea tray ? these are things to give . Men are inclined to consider flowers a waste of good money , though they often like a bouquet or two . Books , however , are always acceptable . If your friend is going to be out of circulation for some weeks , give him a reading stand to fit on his serving table and relieve his invalid hands of the book 's weight . The male patient likes to keep a constant check on the time , too . Unless he has a luminous-dial wrist watch , he will like nothing better than a small , luminous-dial clock for his bedside table . Saves disturbing the nurse . Any gift you send makes a break in the long round , and is a comfort . When you use your head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient will bless you twice over .  | It is no use saying that the best way to get back borrowed books is not to lend them . The average book borrower has cobra blood . He fixes his victim with a wickedly fascinating leer , as a serpent fixes a dove , and before the dove can say , " Why n't - you - try - buying - a - book-for-a-change ! " the cobra has wheedled a cherished volume out of him . I was charmed out of half my modest library by cobras of my acquaintance before I determined to make a serious study of the problem of getting a book back . At first I tried telling borrowers I had n't read the book they were borrowing and therefore would they please return it fairly soon . It was naive of me to make this appeal . It simply aroused the beast in my friends . It was a challenge to them . They never returned the book . They can not help this . It is instinct with book borrowers to thwart the rightful owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chins and pink eyes . I know a fellow whose grandmother was notorious for borrowing cups Jf sugar and similar groceries from the neighbors , never returning same . In her son the tendency cropped out as a morbid urge to oorrow the neighbors ' garden tools , which then were swallowed up by the good earth , as it were . The grandson ? the fellow I know ? became a book borrower . However , I get many a book back from him simply because he happens to be a hypochondriac . All I have to do is call him up and say : " Phelps , old man , I 'm terribly sorry , but the guy who had my copy of Pride and Prejudice just before you borrowed it the other day has come down with smallpox . Better bring it back and let me disinfect it . " Another thing to try is this : When a chum suggests you let him take the Huck Finn volume from your new set of Mark Twain , tell him you 'll be glad to , provided he leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its safe return . If it is not back in a week 's time , Junior goes to reform school . The chink in the armor here is that Junior may himself turn out to be a book borrower ? or , worse , a book ripper ? in which case you have exchanged the frying pan for the fire . I find that the use of force is unwise . Book borrowers are a special kind of kleptomaniac and can not be dealt with like an honest , forthright burglar who creeps into your house to steal your silver . A book borrower may not be one from choice . Possibly his ductless glands , especially the one that regulates book borrowing , are out of kilter . Maybe he was dropped on his head as a child , or on some author 's head ; or maybe an author was dropped on his head , or a copy of a Thomas Wolfe novel . Possibly he has been led astray by some older book borrower , some Folio Fagin , who has taught him the tricks of the nefarious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No thumbscrews . No Iron Maiden , and no third degree . Use stratagem . Outfox him . Pretend you do n't want the book back . Once he finds that out , he will lose interest and either return it immediately or relend it to a BBB . A BBB is a borrowed-bookborrower . He borrows books only from book borrowers , on the principle of second-thief-best-owner . There is no case on record of a lender 's ever having got back a book from a BBB . They do not read the books ; they bury them in a secret cache in the back yard , and if cornered will battle fiercely to retain their biblioloot . I have a trap , which I have used with some success in getting borrowed books back . It is a hollow book containing a talking jack-inthe-box . When the book borrower opens this " book , " the jack pops out into his face and squawks : " Ya-a-a ! You novel nabber ! You tome Turpin ! " This gives the culprit such a shock that a mild amnesia sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daze , before he has quite realized the strangeness of what he is doing . Another effective method of getting back books is to keep a pack of trained authors , if you can afford it . Authors are death on book borrowers , and why not ? If it were n't for book borrowers , authors would eat three times a day . It is a real treat to watch an infuriated author track down a borrower and worry the creature , shaking him up until disgorged books fly through the air . I have not perfected , but am working on , a device that may prove quite a boon to owners of libraries decimated by book borrowers . In it I have tried to combine the best features of the Australian boomerang and the homing pigeon . It is designed to be fastened to a book . It will ? if it works ? cause a tiny burglar alarm to ring at the end of a week 's time , at which signal the book will automatically take wing from the premises of the borrower and fly home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it departs .  |
