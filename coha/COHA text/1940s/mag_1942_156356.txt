The night of August 17 , when the Marines landed on Makin Island , was dark and rainy . The surf was high . Captain James N. M. Davis of Evanston , Ill. lost his pants in the waves . Major James Roosevelt of Washington , second in command to Lieut . Colonel Evans F. Carlson , cut his left index finger on a piece of coral . But the Marines , their faces and hands daubed green to blend with the foliage , all got ashore . <P> First on the beach was Lieut . Wilfred S. Le-Franois of Watertown , N.Y. , with his assault detachment . He and his men had 20 quiet minutes on the island , while rain beat their faces and they edged through the tall palms . Then the Japs discovered them and let loose with a machine gun . Five bullets bore into Lieut . Le-Franois ' left shoulder . He and his men returned the fire and went on . <P> In the meantime Colonel Carlson had led the main group of Marines toward the heart of the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for such things as a piano and a roll of sacred music ( the Marines found no trace of several Catholic nuns who had been on the islands ) . The clatter of the Jap machine gun , firing at Lieut . Le-Franois , first told Colonel Carlson that his landing had been detected . Then the Marines heard the hard chatter of truck and motorcycle engines , the flat crack of snipers ' bullets from the palms . One by one the snipers were killed , but they did not fall from the trees . For many days , so the handsome and friendly Polynesians on the island told Colonel Carlson , the Japs had been strapped into the trees , occasionally receiving food and water from the unwilling natives . <P> Through the night and into the next morning the Japs met Carlson 's men with rifles , machine guns and automatic grenade-throwers . Each machine gun and grenade nest had to be exterminated , to the last Jap . Corporal Edward R. Wygel of Milner , Idaho killed all but two Japs at a machine gun with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two with a pistol , the other with his knife . <P> Lieut . Oscar Peatross of Raleigh , N.C. found his detachment in the Japs ' rear . Three of his men were killed . Lieut . Peatross and the rest burned trucks , killed Jap couriers , destroyed a radio station , finally fought their way back to the beach and returned to their ship , wondering what had happened to Carlson and the main detachment . <P> Sergeant Jim Faulkner of Red Oak , Tex . got shot through the hand . <P> " Goddamit , they got me , " Sergeant Faulkner cried , and went on fighting . <P> He was hit in the head . <P> " Goddamit , they got me again , " Sergeant Faulkner yelped . <P> He was hit in the side . His howl rang through the palms . <P> " Goddamit , they got me ! " <P> He was hit in the leg . <P> " Goddamit , " Sergeant Faulkner announced , " they got me ! " <P> Finally persuaded to return to the beach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half on the operating table and turned to the surgeon . <P> " Goddamit , " said Sergeant Faulkner , " you are trying to starve me ! " <P> He then sat up and had a bowl of soup .
