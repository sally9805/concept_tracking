In the streets of Frankfurt last week , black , red and gold tricolors whipped in the wind . They meant nothing to some people . " What a waste of cloth , " said one old Hausfrau . " Think of the dresses all those flags could make . " <P> But thousands of Germans last week remembered the tricolors as the flag of Germany 's first parliament , which had met in the Pauls-Kirche just 100 years ago . The Frankfurt Assembly had died young , succumbing to the " unity " of Berlin and Bismarck . Last week those who remembered those lost beginnings gathered at battered old St. Paul 's . <P> Runner from the East . Inside the church , Frankfurt 's mayor received relay runners with greetings from all parts of occupied Germany . One had come all the way from Berlin , but he was not even out of breath . The Russians had forbidden him to run through the streets in their sector ; so he had taken the subway to the airport and flown the rest of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about democracy . Instead , they were haunted by a ghost out of the past . To the rostrum stepped Fritz von Unruh , one of Germany 's greatest writers ( Way of Sacrifice ) , a Junker officer who turned pacifist . Exiled by the Nazis , he had spent nearly eight years in the U.S. His grandfather had been the parliament 's presiding officer . Von Unruh reminded his listeners that again &; again since 1848 Germans have trampled freedom to death in their own country . When his audience squirmed , he peered from face to face . " What did you expect to hear from me ? . . . Who among us could forgive himself ? " <P> Then his intense speech slowed ; his figure swayed . Officials supported him before he fell . He was carried out , his notes still clutched in his chalk-white hands . Mayor Kolb explained that the speaker was weak after a serious operation . <P> Wine of Seduction . But Unruh came back and softly spoke again : <P> " If my presence is to have any reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many are afraid to admit to themselves in the deepest cell of their hearts , what in the dust of ruins we still do not recognize : that every single one of us was very well able to choose for himself between right or wrong , justice or chaos . We must withstand the tempters-in whatever gilded cups they may be serving the red wine of seduction-when they cry from the right or from the left : ' Put your ballot in our box and your sins will be forgiven . ' Let us at this moment and in this place give the order to our innermost hearts : ' Germans to the Front ! ' " <P> His face white , Unruh swayed again in the upsurge of applause . In the square , thousands who had heard him through loudspeakers cheered too . A good many Germans , who were eager to forgive themselves , would not listen to Fritz von Unruh ; but even they knew that the voice was the voice of Germany 's conscience .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
