txt The five members of the Senate 's Special Subcommittee on War Mobilization who signed the report which was published yesterday are all Democrats . They have no reason to attempt to make political capital out of the situation which now prevails in Washington . They are all agreed , however , that in the last month " there has been a deterioration of the domestic war effort and a lowering of morale which flows directly from failure to manage decisively the domestic economy of the nation . " In the subcommittee 's judgment , signs of this deterioration and lowering of morale are to be found on many sides : We are plagued by recurring strikes and by administrative failure to attack the root causes of unrest . * * * Government spokesmen have developed no clear policies to integrate the various agencies dealing with economic stabilization . Policy makers have substituted slogans for actions , have appeased where they should have cracked heads , have adjudicated disputes when they should have planned to prevent them . We have proceeded in this field by groping , tentative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * * * High Office of Price Administration officers resign ; others , through lack of centralized direction and firm policy , are permitted to engage in a bitter public struggle . * * * Price control and equitable distribution are in jeopardy as essential food supplies are being engulfed by black markets , while competing agencies without constructive programs wrangle for control . * * * The very agencies needed to control and direct the war economy are disintegrating . This is a grim picture of Washington in the nineteenth month of a war being waged in defense of our very existence as a nation . It may be overdrawn in spots . But the main outlines are increasingly familiar to a large section of the public . The subcommittee identifies one of the main causes of the unsatisfactory situation which it portrays . There have been too many " reorganizations " and too many new " over-all programs " without a clear determination of policy , *and in such circumstances reorganizations and new programs " are merely gestures . " But other basic causes are plain enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is still determined to accept more responsibilities and to make more decisions than any one man can accept or make wisely . He is still reluctant to delegate real authority rather than the fiction of authority . There are still too many agencies in Washington with power over the same problem getting in each other 's way . There are still too many walled-off areas of power which only the President can invade successfully . We are still fighting a " soft " war on the home front . Even though the country is far ahead of it , in its willingness to accept whatever sacrifices are necessary to win the war , the Administration still lacks the political courage to put the domestic economy on a war basis . It has framed no tax program adequate to meet the dangers of inflation . It has proposed no legislation to stop strikes . It has made no effort to marshal the full resources of our manpower under a National War Service Act .                  @ @ @
