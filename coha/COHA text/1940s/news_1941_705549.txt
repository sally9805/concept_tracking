txt One of the greatest sellers markets in history is rapidly developing in the automobile industry . In spite of record breaking production , consumer demand is continuing at such proportions that manufacturers barely keep pace . For the first time since the beginning of the current model year . field stocks have dropped below the level of a year ago . Nevertheless , retail deliveries continue to mount . Should anything happen within the next month or two  --  labor difficulties or shortages of materials due to exigencies of the defense program  --  to interfere with production . there probably would not be enough new cars to go around . Several developments of the past week have brought the threatened automobile shortage into sharp focus . Outstanding were : ( 1 ) Dealers reports to the Detroit area factories indicate that April sales to consumers almost equalled , if it did not surpass , the previous peak of 551,747 units in April , 1929 . It is estimated that 550,000 units were delivered last month , about 3% ahead of March and 35% above April . 1940 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the estimated total they will have topped the April , 1939 , record . 2 . Sales of many Individual makes ran ahead of output and Ford Motor Co. was out of production for most of the month . As a result , field stocks of new cars for the entire industry dropped by about 100,000 units to 443,000 on April 30 . This 18% decline in the month brought the figure to 12% below a year ago . It was the first time this model year that field stocks were below a year ago . 3 . Despite this , unfilled retail orders are holding steady or rising steadily for practically all makes , forecasting continued sales at around peak levels for some time to come . Whether the high on the spring upturn hap been reached yet is not certain . Reports from various leading units in the automobile industry last week have given definite confirmation to the trend . G. M. Figures Show Trend The April report of General Motors Corp . showed that both sales to dealers and retail sales to consumers were the largest for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dealers fell far below retail deliveries . A year ago , factory sales were still somewhat ahead of retail demand in response normal seasonal trends . Factory sales to dealers in April increased to 233,735 units from 226,592 in March and 183 , - 900 in April , 1940 . Sales of General Motors cars to consumers on the other hand , increased to 272,853 units in April from 253,282 in Marcia and 183,461 in April , 1940 . Thus factory sales in April fell shy of retail demands by 39,118 units and by 26,690 units in March , or a total of 65,808 units in the two months . This means that since the beginning of September , General Motors ' factory sales have exceeded the total retail sales by 92,492 units whereas a year ago at this time the figure stood at 147,810 . Chrysler Corp . last week reported that retail sales in the United States of Chrysler . DeSoto , Dodge and Plymouth passenger cars and trucks for the first three months of 1941 Jumped to 274,298 units from 214,425 in the same period last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28% above a year ago but dealers stocks of new cars are only 5% above last year . A year ago at this time , the corporation reported that " dealers stocks of new cars were only 21.5% higher than a year ago , indicating a faster turnover . " The other member of the Big Three , Ford Motor Co .. was out of production for most of April . Reflecting the progressively sold out condition of Ford dealers , sales were off 15% in the final 10 days of April as compared with the similar period in March . At the end of the first 20 days , on the other hand , sales were up 17% while a gain of 45% was shown at the end of the first 10 days . As compared with a year ago , sales showed gain of 35% for the 30 days , of 32% for the first 20 and of 43% for the first 10 days . Demand Likely to Continue How long trill ? public demand will continue , of course , is problematical but it is probably good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is coming in on the rising tide of employment and payrolls in defense industries . Eventually , however , and probably before another year , higher taxes and living costs will bring a decline In new car demand . The outlook from the production end is further complicated by the defense program . It already is being suggested that because of a shortage of materials essential both to the automobile industry and to the defense effort that the automotive industry may have difficulty even in reaching the 80% allotment under the curtailment agreement for the next model year . Already substitutions and economies are being made on critical materials and wide-scale training programs are schooling thousands of new workers for jobs in the auto arms plants . These preparations may prove inadequate in the capes of at least one or two producers which would mean they would have to transfer men and materials from regular to defense output . It is taken for granted that eventually the initial 20% slash in auto production ordered by the 0/alid will be increased . At the moment , ho --  .. ever , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in the first quarter of 1942 . On the other hand , some companies may be forced to drop output below the allowable levels in order to expedite their defense effort even before the arms p:ante make their peak demand for supplies and labor in the late nrst quarter and early second quarter of next year . The most immediate threat to automobile production is organized labor 's insistent demand for sharply higher wage rates and the closed shop . While the National Defense Mediation Board has assumed jurisdiction in the case of the ' United Auto Workers-CIO threatened strike against General Motors Corp .. this does not necessarily mean that there will be no strike . Other companies also face contract renewal negotiations before the year ends and in all of these the same demands will be made as were made against G. M. Industry Producing While It May In the meantime , the industry will try to produce as many cars and trucks as it can for as long as it can . Output this month , with Ford Motor Co. working six days a week to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximate 550,000 units against 500,000 in April and 413,000 a year ago . About 500,000 unite are scheduled for production in June against 353 , - 000 last year , and 270,000 in July against 246,000 in July , 1940 . August schedules are uncertain because of the change over for new models and institution of the curtailment . From September to the end of 1941 , present plans call for production r T. the maximum allowable with about 1.700,000 units being built in the four-month period . In discussing future additional production limitations , automotive sources point out that annual production of about 2,400,000 new vehicles has been required over the past 10 years just to maintain present transportation facilities . That number of old vehicles is scrapped each year . All forms of transportation will be meeting increased demand and usage as the nation a arms production increases , so that the minimum number of new cars and trucks necessary to retain the status quo of the nation 's freight and passenger motor vehicle transport will be stepped up in coming months .
