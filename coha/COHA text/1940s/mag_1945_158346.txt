Since Christmas just three rains have fallen on Bogota . But not one drop has touched the city 's reservoir , 15 miles away at Regadera ( which means " shower bath " in Spanish ) . Intimidated by the brassy skies , duly alarmed by the nearly empty " shower bath , " local authorities last week urged all Bogotanos to get out of town if they possibly could . Some water mains were already dry . Schools were beginning to close down . Washing an automobile was declared a crime . <P> Partly to blame was the U.S. engineer who designed the water system , not dreaming that the city would grow from 332,000 to half a million in seven years . But Bogota boosters were not in a mood to boast . Only the local temperance leaguers felt like rejoicing : the flow of workingmen 's chicha ( corn beer ) was also drying up .
