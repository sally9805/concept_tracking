In just two days , without a single dissenting vote , a bill for Canada 's one million World War II veterans zipped through the House of Commons . Eligible for its benefits were all soldiers who volunteered for service overseas ( whether they went over or not ) plus those Home Defense Army " zombies " who served in Kiska . Uneligible : all other " zombies . " <P> The bill 's chief provisions : <P> A bonus : $7.50 for each 30-days ' service in the Western Hemisphere ( except the Aleutians ) , plus $15 for each 30-days ' service overseas ( including the Aleutians ) , plus an extra week 's pay for each six months overseas . <P> A $100 clothing allowance . <P> An outright gift , roughly equal to the amount of the bonus , but payable only for specified civilian rehabilitation purposes , such as buying houses . <P> All gratuities would be taxfree . A private who enlisted at war 's start and went overseas with the first Canadian troops could get up to $1,700 . <P> Estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a round billion . But no one blinked . The bill was not only a bow to those who fight . It also constituted an approach to postwar pump-priming , a system of preparing in advance against depression .
