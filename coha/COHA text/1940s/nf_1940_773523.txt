txt FAMILY BEHAVIOR it is likely that spendthrifts and misers are to a large extent the products of their early experiences as children . Too much emphasis upon earning and rights is perhaps as detrimental to a child as too little . Experimentation with funds , too freely urged and too little guided , may , on the other hand , prove disastrous in the long run . One needs but to glance at a large daily paper to find numerous instances of crimes that are committed for purposes of financial gain . A few years ago the papers reported nearly every day the tragic ending of the life story of men who had lost their " savings " and who felt that they could no longer live . Poverty is sometimes regarded as the cause of inevitable personal maladjustment . Without going into the question of the effects of real poverty on social or personal adjustment , we can readily observe that unhappiness due to " inadequate " income is not determined by the amount of income one may have .

Even more important to happiness than a balance between wants and money to gratify them , is the balance between one 's appreciation of human values and values that can be measured in terms of " so much . " The reactions of men and women who have suffered acute financial losses as the result of the depression illustrate the range of adjustments possible . It would be difficult to discuss or even to list in this chapter all the money attitudes which are being fostered within families , but to illustrate what is meant by attitudes toward money and the balance // between economic and human values , a few excerpts from the diary of Samuel Pepys ' have been included . He appears to have been much interested in budgeting and saving his money , since he mentions accounting at frequent intervals , but he also shows an appreciation of the human values which are usually involved in money transactions and an amused realization of the two interests more or less in conflict in his own life : ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourse with my wife thought upon inviting my Lord Sandwich to a dinner shortly .

" * FAMILY BEHAVIOR Studies suggest , however , that routine jobs are not equally dissatisfying to all workers . In work , as in recreational reading or other leisure interests , there are obviously some men and women who are happy only when engaged in intellectual activity , while others prefer other means of self-expression , such as vigorous physical activity . There are some who like to solve problems , while others evidently prefer activities which are more routine and more predictable .

He reports also several other studies which add weight to the belief that mental level must be taken into account in studying job satisfactions . In one situation it was noted that the more intelligent girls were more easily bored by continuous crossstitching ; and in another , operators who were engaged in winding and inserting filaments in electric lamps , soap wrappers , chocolate packers and tobacco wrappers displayed a similar tendency for the more intelligent to become bored more quickly than those who enjoyed intellectual activities less . It is interesting to note further in the latter study , that boredom was not related to reduced output since the bored and intelligent workers were more productive than the less bored and less intelligent .

He might have gone out had the idea struck him , but in the years I knew him , the last of his brave life , I think he was only in the open twice , when he flitted ' ? changed his room for another hard by .

' These lines of Cowley were new to me , but the sentiment was not new , and I marvelled how the old tailor could see through me so well .

" * Intellectual interests alone can not account for all the fits and misfits in work , but studies have shown how important it is that those who enjoy mental work should be engaged in vocations which encourage them to be thoughtful and mentally alert while on the job , and that one who does not enjoy thought-provoking work should not be chosen for intellectual tasks . Various occupations have been rated and scaled according to the " mental level " of those who might follow them happily and constructively . Barr has prepared a scale which can be applied to many types of work . In making the scale , he listed twenty-one representative occupations and submitted the list to twenty judges for ratings as to the grade of intelligence which each occupation seemed to demand . The judges ' ratings were statistically treated and scale values from zero to 20.71 were assigned to the different occupations . The " work " of a hobo , for example , was given a rating of zero , while the activities of an inventive genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20.71 . The job of a teamster rated 5.41 ; the work of a bricklayer , 7.77 ; of a carpenter , 9.37 ; of a clerical worker , 11.34 ; of a grammar grade teacher , 13.08 . The work of a mining engineer was rated at 16.26 ; that of a physician , 16.71 ; of a university professor , 17.81 ; and the activities of a research leader ( like Pasteur ) , 19.45 . In using the scale in connection with his studies of gifted children , Terman found that the fathers of WORKING AND SHARING INCOME genius children tended to be engaged in occupations which rated at about 12.77 , work corresponding to that of a stenographer , librarian in a small city or a primary teacher . The average worker , according to Terman 's estimate , is doing work which would rate ( on the Barr scale ) between 7.91 and 8.75 . This middle range would include occupations such as that of baker , metal finisher , plasterer , painter , letter-carrier , stone-mason and plumber . With so many kinds of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aptitudes of men and women , the problem of fitting work to workers is a complicated one for parents , as well as for those who make a profession of vocational guidance . Generalizations about the wide range of choice possible to the youth who is about to embark upon an independent career must of course be discounted during a period of extensive unemployment ; but even during an economic depression , the possibility of making choices still holds . In various educational centers guidance specialists are helping girls and boys to select suitable vocations . The best that any vocational adviser can do , however , is to advise about the type of work which is likely , in individual cases , to be interesting , profitable and expedient . He can not choose a vocation or educate the girl or boy for the job . The family or parents must assume the responsibility of educating children so that they may make choices as wisely as possible . No one can point out any one vocation which is sure to be best . Some parents and their older children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic advantages and the vocational guidance values of a four-year liberal // arts college . While the personal values of college are not to be questioned in most cases , it does not appear to be wise to expect a college diploma to serve as the magic wand which , when waved , will open the door of vocational opportunity . Even after selecting a profession prior to going to college , the young man or woman is not assured of either a comfortable living or a happy life . In one college , ninety-five per cent of the student bodyll planned to go into teaching , medicine , law or dentistry , seventy per cent selecting the three most overcrowded occupations . They tended to believe that they would earn four times as much as the average person actually earns in the selected field . Most of the students in this college ( ninety-one per cent ) have foreign-born parents whose faith in the professions is no doubt reflected in the vocational choices of their children . Of the parents themselves , only three per cent were trained in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys , in a study of vocational preferences , 12 showed a similar tendency to choose vocations different from those of their parents and a similar lack of knowledge of the fields in which they desired to work . The boys in this study chose engineering more often than any other vocation , with aviation and farming ranking next . Their choices appeared to be unrelated to their scholastic achievements . The girls gave first place to teaching , with business next in frequency of choice . The boys , in many instances , reported that their parents had urged them to consider money in choosing work , while many of the girls appeared to have been counselled to consider fitness first in choosing a vocation . Both girls and boys in the study group considered financial return // less than personal satisfaction as a first criterion in selecting a vocation , giving as the first reason for making a choice , " like it , " with personal fitness second . In another study of vocational preferences , 13 technical school boys between the ages of fourteen and seventeen gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vocation selected because it seemed to be opportune and convenient . All studies of this type , as well as casual observations of adolescents as they face the problem of selecting a means of earning a living , seem to emphasize the responsibility of the family for starting the vocational education of children long before they are ready to consider the question as to just which occupation they shall choose . While the modern family can not assume the responsibility for training children in vocational technics , the necessity for helping children to acquire work habits and attitudes which will carry over into their lives as economic providers is more important today than it has ever been . It is much easier to teach the skills required in a specific field of work than to nurture the slow-growing attitudes which will help young men and women to adjust well to a vocational career in an uncertain society of many workers , many kinds of work and shifting economic theories . To engage in such a program of nurture is challenge enough for any one family . Dr. Walter Binghaml ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has had many opportunities to study the vocational needs of prospective workers from many angles , makes the following statement which bears directly upon the problem of parents and children . " The abilities most // essential in these occupations of the future will be abilities in personnel and social relations . The education of the future must provide then , more specifically and usefully than heretofore , a kind of training to develop proficiency in the best ways of living and working together . " * The parents and child who must make a choice between the vocational and avocational possibilities of a special talent or aptitude are confronted by an interesting but most perplexing problem . Men and women who have not been allowed to follow their bent often illustrate the tragedy of thwarted genius . On the other hand , talents do not always prove to be of great advantage vocationally , as the impoverished artist or musician who can not market his art illustrates all too frequently . The parents of a child who displays an unusual ability or interest can not afford to risk either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livelihood . It has seemed best to many such parents to consider special aptitudes as avocational , until time has proved the desirability of turning an avocation into a vocation . A distinguished scientist whose reconstructions of prehistoric man are to be seen today in the Museum of Natural History in New York , tells of his early interest in skulls of animals and his boyish plans for an expedition to Africa to study gorillas . At the age of eight or nine , he made a list of all the things he would need when he went to Africa , and nearly fifty years later his childish dreams became a reality . A mother who was interested in // scientific study and a home environment in which the lad could carry on his experiments were essential to the fulfilment of the boy 's dream . His mother not only tolerated the dead cats and squirrels that were necessary to scientific research but provided a place where dissection could proceed at any time . Her tolerance was put to the supreme test when a zoo monkey which had been buried for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed among the young scientist 's cherished trophies . In this case avocation and vocation became one , but if the boy 's interest had never become a means of earning a living , the contribution of this one mother to the growth of her son would have repaid her for " inconvenience " such as most mothers do not need to suffer in nurturing genius . In educating children to adjust happily , in the home , to problems of family work and the sharing of the family income , parents and other adults can not hope to be successful unless home and family problems are considered as a part of a larger social problem . If it is difficult to suggest specific ways of meeting work and money problems within any one family , it is much more difficult to state what a family of today ought to do about the economic adjustment of neighbors . The socialist would suggest one answer , the communist another , and the conservative economist something different . The challenge of economic unrest is one which can best be met , first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best and most straightforward thinking of informed adults . The very fact that the modern family is living in an age // of many experiments , many theories and many honest opinions which are bound to conflict , is evidence of the fact that one of the first responsibilities of the modern family is to encourage members to become vitally interested in the workers of the world , in their work , their incomes , and in ways and means of bringing a maximum of security to all families . SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY AND DISCUSSION 1 . Parents are often puzzled about the best way to teach younger members of the family to share in work responsibilities ; and because of their perplexity , this aspect of home education is sometimes unsatisfactory to children as well as to their parents . The old idea that work is necessarily hard or exacting is still influencing modern families . Some parents react against the old-fashioned doctrine of " work for work 's sake " by shielding their children from assigned tasks , while others go to the opposite extreme . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work , in the home and in the community , to fit an age of increased leisure and of economic interdependence of workers at all levels . ( 1 ) What do you know about the philosophy of your own parents in regard to the educational values of shared work in the home ? ( 2 ) If you were responsible for a family , would you do as your parents have done , as far as children 's share in family work is concerned ? ( 3 ) Compare your answers to the two questions with those of your classmates or other associates . Can you summarize the observations of grown children looking backward ? 2 . In one family a mother believed that she should not tell her young son that household workers in her employ // were working for money . She defended her conviction by arguing that a realization that members of the household worked for pay would destroy the boy 's ideals of service . Can you find any arguments in support of her theory ? How might an opposing viewpoint be stated ? 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each child has had " chores " to do ? Whether you have or not , interview older men and women to discover how their home tasks appear in retrospect . Remember the " Old Oaken Bucket Delusion " mentioned on page 92 and try to find out what the lasting impression has been , whether agreeable or disagreeable . Can you draw any conclusions about the advantages or disadvantages of chores ? 4 . Morgan15 classifies workers under eight heads : the bubbling energy worker , the fearful worker , the dutiful worker , the pioneer , the applause seeker , the compensating worker ( striving to compensate for a real or imagined personal defect ) , the dominating worker , the intelligent worker . ( 1 ) Can you find illustrations of these types in actual life ? ( 2 ) What type of childhood experiences might encourage habits of working fearfully , for applause , dutifully and so on ? Discuss at length in an exchange of opinions , in class or elsewhere . 5 . Do you have any convictions about allowances ; how they should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions on how the family problem might best be attacked either by parents or by their older children . 6 . It is not necessary to raise the debatable question as to what may be the so-called " instinctive drives " which impel men to work , in order to appreciate the fact that many workers can and do find their activities gratifying . Illustrations of work that is done mainly " for fun " can be gathered // easily : the landscape gardener who spends his leisure hours in horticultural experiments , the carpenter who gets out his tool kit on his day off in order to make boats for his neighbor 's children , the employed scientist who maintains a laboratory at home so that he can work at night and over the week-end , and numerous others . How many such illustrations can you gather from real life ? Is this question related in any way to Homemade Attitudes toward Work as discussed in this chapter ? 7 . In a community in Europe ' , in which the majority of families ( three hundred and seventy-six of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dole , social workers noted certain common developments under the dole system . The health of the community seemed to improve and old feuds were settled . The villagers , however , did not trouble to report thefts of dogs , cats or food , nor did they read the newspapers and the books that were provided in a free library . An attempt was made to discover the characteristic attitudes of residents in this dole community and sixty-eight per cent were rated as " resigned , " twenty-three per cent " unbroken , " and eight per cent " desperate or apathetic . " It was , without question , a situation in which many of the customary activities of life did not appear to be worth while . Can you suggest any explanation of this apparent loss of community morale ? 8 . Observations of men and women at work in all sorts of situations suggest that economic incentives alone can not account for all the working activities of those who are employed . If it were possible to measure the depth of human suffering due to unemployment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less acute mental anguish than the loss of a place in the world of active men . We can not say whether it is or is not normal for men to want to earn a living , but studies of human nature repeatedly show that it is normal for men to want to belong to active groups . // In a direct approach to the question as to whether many workers find their jobs a source of satisfaction , Hoppock " studied some of the work activities of a representative group of adults living in a manufacturing village in New Jersey . They were asked , among other questions , . which they liked better , their work or their leisure activities , and sixty-six per cent replied that they liked their work better . About half the group ( forty-eight per cent ) stated that they thought they would keep their present jobs even though they could choose from " all the jobs in the world . " The workers were asked to check the phrase which best described the way they felt about their present positions . The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like their work . In Hoppock 's study , various factors which seemed to contribute to work satisfaction . were analyzed statistically , and economic return was found to be less related to job satisfaction than some other factors , such as success on the job , social status , recognition and interest . Quayle18 found a similar tendency for size of income to appear relatively unimportant among factors contributing to happiness . ( 1 ) Select workers who are engaged in various kinds of work which you would consider unpleasant , and ask for a rating similar to that used by Hoppock . Compare your findings with those of your associates . Can you draw any conclusions as to whether work is pleasant , tolerable , or distasteful to the workers whom you have interviewed ? // ( 2 ) Ask your classmates or friends to rate , on the same scale , certain routine tasks such as cleaning the car , washing dishes , etc . How do certain tasks tend to be rated ? ( 3 ) Using the same scale , ask a large group of college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school curriculum . With the combined results of ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , what can you conclude as to the place of work in the normal lives of normal persons ? 9 . In reporting the vocational preferences of gifted children , 1 c Terman comments upon the tendency of many to select occupations on a lower level than their superior capacities seemed to warrant . Interview children of various ages , asking them what they expect to do when they grow up . Do their aspirations seem to be consistent with their social or educational background ? 10 . Money is the cause of most crime . In a report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation19 for the year 1939 , we find that there were , every hour , 9 offenses against persons and 161.8 offenses against property . The greatest number of arrests were of persons aged 19 . Consider what might be done in families to lessen the number of offenses against property . Is it a matter for direct teaching ? When should education to guard against disrespect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stop ! Do n't think ! ! " A carefree motorist who showed signs of slowing down as he approached a fork in a scenic rural highway , was startled to hear a traffic officer addressing him in these words . Needless to say , the driver accelerated his speed , and without delaying to weigh the respective merits of the two roads , took the turn which could be accomplished with a minimum loss of time , ? and followed the crowd . As he went on his way , or rather on the way which seemed easier at the moment , he may have pondered over the curious state of affairs which made it so difficult for him to go where he wanted to go on his day off , and to choose the speed at which he should travel . The driver , the stream of traffic moving along at a high rate of speed , the fork in the road , the officer , and quiet , secluded by-paths leading off the main-traveled highway are all familiar aspects of a drama of modern life which might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we were to add the wayside stands with their invitations to buy this , that , and the other thing , we should have the essentials of a prologue to a modern Pilgrim 's Progress .

As he continues on the main road , accompanied by hundreds of other motorists , he may suspect that in some one littletraveled , narrow road there may be many things to challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise much initiative or originality in . opposition to public pressure , and so goes along with the crowd . If we were to observe him another time as he sets out to use a few hours of leisure time , we should probably find him hanging to a strap in a crowded subway train , street car or bus ; going to mingle with another pushing , jostling swarm of humanity at one of the beaches , in the lobby of a motion picture theater , or at some other place where pleasure seekers are herded together . He acts as though he believed in making some use of his leisure hours , but he does not seem to know how to make the most of his free time . He is almost childlike in his choice of pleasures , as though opportunities for recreation and time to play had developed too rapidly for him . His predicament seems to be that of the average modern family , ? which does not lack for time for leisure activities , but which has not yet discovered how to find in recreation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social scientists often mention the so-called " cultural lag " which characterizes modern society and which is presumably due to the fact that modern inventions have FAMILY BEHAVIOR progressed at such a pace that those who might be expected to benefit from them tend to lag behind in their knowledge of how to profit from them . This is nowhere more apparent than in the way many are using their leisure opportunities , as has just been suggested . To understand what is back of the " recreational lag " one needs to consider not only the development of time and opportunities for leisure , but also the slower development of public attitudes toward such opportunities . By public attitudes is meant popular beliefs and widespread tendencies for large groups to behave in accordance with their beliefs . In order to appreciate the problem of leisure as it appears to the family today , it is necessary to turn back to the early settlers of this country who not only had no time for play , but regarded with marked intolerance the person who believed in carefree spontaneous recreation for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established settlements in new territories , erected houses and provided food , clothing , and fuel for their families are familiar facts of history . Many kindergarten children know that houses were once made of logs ; that sheep were sheared and the wool spun by the fireside ; and that food was provided by fathers and mothers who worked from morning to night . School children , in their social studies , are introduced to the inventions and conveniences of modern life and , as present-day economy is contrasted with pioneer , youthful students are made aware of the fact that the families of long ago did not have the advantages which are now taken for granted . Many adults , reading about the work-dominated lives of earlier genera- // tions , are doubtless glad that " we have left all that behind , " and are living at a time when the necessities of life may be obtained without such large expenditures of human energy . What we do not see , as a rule , is that we have not left all that behind , but that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of various kinds and our relative ignorance of the satisfactions which may be discovered through well-directed leisure are still influenced by the attitudes of our fathers ' fathers , as theirs in turn have been influenced by their parents and grandparents . Brought up in an environment which placed a high value on work , the children of frontier families had little occasion to discover leisure interests which they might hand down to their offspring . " Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do " probably had more than a surface meaning for the young seamstress or wood-chopper who would some day preach the same doctrine of glorified labor to children of a new generation . It may have been easier , in those days , to get along without play activities which are now so general , because life seems to have been much less tense and work appears to have furnished more outlets for normal human interests . Vigorous , out-door enterprises were often in the nature of sport , although the hunter or fisherman , busily engaged in providing food for his family , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be regarded as recreational . Returning with a fine kill or catch , to the commendations of his family , he had many opportunities to experience the joy of personal achievement , noted and approved by his associates . // While it would be difficult to discover the sporting element in the routine tasks of the weary homemaker , she too may have found in her work certain satisfactions which women of today seek through leisure . Dyeing cotton and wool by experimental methods , designing patterns for weaving or quilting ; making much out of little , the pioneer wife and mother was not denied the gratifications to be found in creative self-expression . The social interests of families living in pioneer communities were met without setting aside time for entertainment . There were , in all such situations , numerous occasions which brought families together in friendly cooperative labor . Activities such as harvesting , sheep shearing , sugar boiling and house or barn raising were community affairs ? not because our ancestors realized the personal advantages of social gatherings but because life was so organized that neighbor needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group activities there was a competitive element which must have done much to satisfy a need which the modern family seeks in games of various kinds . Corn-husking and carding bees , the old-time quilting bees , and similar contests must have added a much needed spice to the work-a-day world . Although , in the rigorous activities necessary to maintain life with a reasonable degree of comfort , pioneers may have satisfied some of the human needs which are met today in recreation , a brief survey of laws enacted in Colonial days suggests that there must have been numerous recalcitrant souls who were determined to play . Massachu- // setts passed a law in 16721 ' forbidding the importation of playing cards or dice , and encouraged its enforcement by dividing the imposed fine between the treasury and the informant . There was also a law against singing , fiddling and piping . The development of public attitudes toward leisure , from the intolerance of early New England settlers to the somewhat reckless enthusiasm of the present , can not be traced without a detailed and laborious analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through casual reading , detect certain developments which seem to be related either directly or indirectly to attitudes commonly observed today . About the time that Massachusetts was enacting laws to stamp out the use of playing cards and dice , Virginia appears to have found it desirable to state just who might participate in certain recreational activities and who should be barred . According to a judicial decision in 1674,1b it was ordered that a tailor and his equal might not race horses . Although both laws were directed against activities which would encourage gambling , the Massachusetts law prohibiting cards and dice altogether , and the Virginia ruling which favored a " leisure class " represent two points of view which seem to have contributed to certain present-day attitudes toward leisure . In letters , deportment guides and other materials directed to the " genteel female , " we can discover evidence of a planned " education for leisure " which aimed to teach favored young women just how to play sedately and with due regard for the proprieties . In studying the recrea- - tional outlets provided for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the independent young woman of today , it is not difficult to trace a third set of leisure attitudes which can not be entirely disregarded in an attempt to understand why so many modern adults play as they do , and why older and younger members of modern families sometimes find it hard to agree on what constitutes well chosen leisure . Two excerpts from an anthology of writings about the " genteel female " illustrate the " leisure " background of many women who were carefully taught how to play formally . " As soon as you are seated , lay aside wraps , get your opera glass in readiness , and compose yourself for the evening . . . . Those who have no music in their souls , but who go to the opera to see the styles and be seen themselves , should remember that etiquette demands of them an entire submission to the rules of time and place . They must listen to the strings that delight other ears in decorous silence . " Amateur performers upon the piano should thoroughly commit to memory a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take sheet music to a party is a hint that they expect to be invited to play . If possible , have the voice in good condition also , so as not to be obliged to complain of a cold . To eat a small amount of horse-radish just previous to reading , singing or speaking , will effectually remove hoarseness . " Any lady guest being invited to play the piano , it is a courtesy for the gentleman nearest her to offer his arm and escort her to the instrument . While she is playing he will hold her bouquet , fan and gloves , and should also turn the leaves if he can readily read music , but he should not attempt it otherwise . " // Sedate grandparents who were once Genteel Females would , no doubt , view the recreational activities of the present generation with perplexity , if not with dismay . They might well wonder what had become of their contemporaries who were reared in an atmosphere of intolerance toward spontaneous play , as they observed not only the youth of today but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " restlessly on the move , subscribing wholeheartedly to a belief in informal recreation . They would find all social groups represented in throngs of pleasure-bent men , women and children . Among the crowds gathered in public places they would look in vain for survivals of the formal " occasions " on which " etiquette " seemed to be not so much a guide to social conduct as an end in itself . During the long years that our forebears were building up and cherishing fine traditions of industry , personal integrity and devotion to duty , traditions of well-spent leisure appear to have been neglected except in the case of those who were taught to play with proper decorum . The leisure habits of the present generation , possibly because of the lack of traditions , are proceeding according to a method which seems to involve a large degree of individual trial and error . One who stands off and contemplates the leisure activities of modern families en masse , may be overwhelmed by the large amount of error which seems to be involved in learning how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be less discouraging , especially if the observer were to watch those who are enjoying themselves in small // groups or are absorbed in some kind of solitary pleasure . In spite of the haphazard education for leisure which characterizes the majority today , one may find , in the activities of a smaller group , evidence of a new appreciation of personal values to be discovered during the hours which are not filled with the routine demands of daily living . Many modern influences are responsible for the encouragement of this most recent and far-reaching minority attitude , and educators , recreation leaders and enlightened parents have all had a share in its development . If the truth could be known , however , we might discover that the greatest contribution of all has been made indirectly by men and women who have not pictured themselves in the role of public benefactors ? jobless men and women who have been forced to discover for themselves certain values in life which can not be destroyed even though one may be removed from his particular niche in the work-a-day world . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the unemployed , has realized that his development has been so one-sided that when severed from his job he seems to have lost a large part of his individuality . He discovers that he does not know how to occupy his time , that he has little to talk about , and that he is a most uninteresting person ? apart from any financial crisis which he may be facing . The more thoughtful person under such circumstances begins to reorganize his habits so that he may be happily occupied even though he can not return to his job . The past few years have seen thousands of brave men and women taking up all sorts of new leisure interests and discovering in them // satisfactions which are not dependent upon job or employer , prosperity or financial crisis . Finding in their leisure activities a means of living creatively and contentedly , apart from a paid job , these hardy men and women are helping to build up a new and valuable tradition ? the use of leisure for the maintenance of personal integrity . THE NEW LEISURE CHALLENGES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is often heard today . To some it suggests social and economic problems of national and international scope , while to others it apparently means new opportunities for making money through serving an increasing crowd of pleasure seekers . To the educator it means a new challenge to provide better ways of spending leisure and a growing appreciation of the relationship between well-spent leisure and personal growth . To the individual it may mean any one of a variety of things : time to go , time to rest , a chance to choose , or time to develop an original bent . Whatever approach one may make to a better understanding of this recent social trend , he will soon discover that the modern family is vitally concerned with this , as with every other social development . When leisure is considered in the light of personal growth , the challenge to the family is obvious . There are many reasons why this challenge is particularly acute just now . Many forces have been operating to shorten the working hours of men and women in industry , and labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the job . This means that the average worker has a certain // amount of free time and that he is likely to have a surplus of energy which needs some kind of outlet . In many family groups there seems to be little direct provision for helping members to spend either extra time or surplus energy . Neighborhood surveys and studies of modern recreational trends show the rapid development of commercialized amusements of various type , and the presence of motion picture theaters and other public entertainments at the very door of the average urban family . With few traditions of leisure , time to spare , energy to be spent , the stimulation of restless neighbors and the many inducements which are offered for recreation en masse , families everywhere are learning some kind of new habits in adjusting to the " new leisure . " DOES THE AVERAGE ADULT HAVE MUCH LEISURE ? Studies of trends in industry since the beginning of the century show a tendency toward a shorter working week with , of course , a corresponding increase in the amount of leisure time available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage earners , according to a report from the Brookings Institute , 3 shifted in thirty years from about fifty-seven hours in 1900 to approximately fifty hours in 1929 , dropping during the next five year period to an estimated average of forty hours . As a result of emergency measures , first undertaken to relieve the acute unemployment situation , some economists are urging a permanent and wide-scale reduction to a fixed working week of thirty hours . There is also apparent , according to a Babson report , 4 a trend toward a five day week , 5.5 per cent of industrial workers now // operating on that basis . This is most marked in the building trades in which 60 per cent of workers have a five day week . Among automobile employees , 44 per cent are on a five day schedule ; as are 34 per cent of radio workers , 27 per cent of aircraft workers , and 15 per cent of woolen mill employees . It is difficult to distinguish between long time trends and the developments of the depression period , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward a shorter working day is real , leaving out of consideration debatable questions as to how far we are likely to go in lessening the working time of those employed in industry . Studies of the average working day in industry do not , of course , tell us what is happening to the work schedule of farmers , " white-collar " employees , men and women engaged in professions , or those in the " income group . " A better approach to the general question of how leisure may be distributed is through an analysis of daily schedules among residents in various communities . Lundberg5 and his associates have made a study of this type in a suburban county of New York State . Diaries were kept by two thousand four hundred and sixty different persons , for periods ranging from one to seven days . The group included : a few laborers and sixty women , most of whom were employed in factories ; a larger number of executive or professional men , housewives , white-collar workers , and students ; and some unemployed men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time which was " not devoted to sleep , work , or the activities incidental thereto . " When the diary reports were reduced to aver // ages , an nteresting uniformity was to be observed from group to group . In the following tabulation , based upon averages which included week-ends as well as working days , 5a all groups , with the exception of housewives and the unemployed , appear to have , in the course of a week , about the same total amount of leisure time . In comparing averages we should not of course draw any final conclusions as to the amount of time available each day to members of the different groups . The woman factory worker , for example , might have very little - AloWlIWRIOR 1 // leisure on working days but might , on the other hand , be relatively free on week-ends ; while the housewife who has a larger total amount of leisure might not be able to find such a large block of week-end time which she could use exactly as she chose . Although averages tell little about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this study of a suburban county of New York State it is significant that " leisure income " was distributed with a fair degree of uniformity in all groups . COMMON WAYS OF SPENDING LEISURE In the study under discussion the bulk of the leisure of all groups was found to be devoted to the same activities . Eating , in this study , was classified as leisure and the amount of time devoted to this essential but more or less leisurely activity was about the same in all groups , approximating one hour and forty-five minutes a day . In the following tabulation , which is adapted from averages given in the report , 5b two significant facts may be noted : ( 1 ) that the major amount of the leisure of each group was devoted to the same activities , and ( 2 ) that certain of these appear to be preferred by some groups ( as judged by time allowance ) , and relatively unimportant ( also in terms of time ) in the schedule of others . Percentage estimates in this tabulation , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , totaling about one hundred per cent ; near enough to give a rough picture of how the various groups are using their leisure time . No attempt was made to compute reliable differences between groups , and in making any such comparisons we need to consider // them only as suggestive of differences which may prove to be real . At least sixty per cent of the leisure time of each group was devoted to the six common types of leisure activities . When the time set aside for eating is added to this total , eighty or more per cent of the leisure time of each group is represented . Visiting ( social activity ) seems to have been popular among women and girls since at least one fifth of their leisure time was allotted to activities of this type . Men also reported visiting activities as most fre- // quent except in the case of laboring men , who reported an equal amount of time spent in reading . High-school boys and college students made less frequent mention of leisure activities in this class . Time given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leisure , except in the reports of professional or executive men , and the ten men classified as " labor . " Entertainments occupied from four to twelve per cent of the leisure time of the different groups , white-collar women and high-school girls reporting the largest proportionate blocks of time and professionalexecutive men the least . Sports claimed from three to twenty-three per cent of the leisure time of the different groups , housewives and college students representing the two extremes . The proportion of free time devoted to the radio varied from five per cent , reported by three groups , to thirteen per cent , in the schedules of " labor " women . Motoring claimed from one to six per cent of the leisure time of the various groups , college students devoting the least proportionate amount of time to this activity and white-collar women the most . The activities not accounted for in the tabulation are classified in the report under " clubs " and " miscellaneous . " The labor groups did not report club activities , and in all other groups except housewives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned to clubs . The housewives present a distinct picture , however , since eleven per cent of leisure , or about one hour a day , was devoted to club activities . GOING PLACES In the tabulations just mentioned there is nothing to indicate how much of the leisure time of the various groups FAMILY BEHAVIOR was spent at home and how much outside the home . The figures show , however , that a large amount of time was devoted to activities which would necessarily be carried on away from home . In the same study , some facts about home versus outside activities were gathered from high school girls and boys who were asked to tell about the most enjoyable occasion of the past year , mentioning , among other things , where it took place . Although " most enjoyable " and " most frequent " are by no means interchangeable , the results5c bear indirectly upon the question as to whether leisure time is more likely to be spent at home or elsewhere . Ninety-five per cent of the boys and 83 per cent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had not been at home . There are not many reports available to show how families may be providing for leisure in the home , but there have been many surveys of modern developments which encourage the average person to follow the crowd in his hours of leisure rather than to explore the possibilities which lie within his own home . In nearly all urban communities the immediate neighborhood provides public parks and playgrounds as well as motion pictures and other commercial amusements . Travel is so easy , and automobiles are so common that few are restricted to the neighborhood environment . The older child or adult who stays at home either because he has no place to go or no means of transportation is relatively rare . According to various estimates ' there are enough automobiles in the United States to provide one for every five persons in the total population . In 1900 there were about eight thousand " horseless carriages " in the entire country . // In thirty years the number increased to 22,811,103 ( registration reported in January , 1931 ) . A recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to assume that all were to be put on the road at once , and loaded to maximum capacity , every man , woman and child in the United States , by submitting to the discomfort of being crowded , could go for a ride at the same time . If , instead of motoring , one eleventh of the population , or approximately nine persons out of every one hundred , should wish to attend picture shows at the same hour , the capacity8a of motion picture theaters in the United States is sufficient to admit all of them . The remaining 91 per cent of the population could continue on the move for a long time without exhausting the possibilities of spending leisure away from home . Some would no doubt wish to travel to distant scenes , and many would choose to spend the night in a camp of some kind . They would find that in our national and state parks the traveling public is not only permitted to enter , but encouraged to do so . Camping facilities have been provided extensively , and today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parks are made available to millions . In 1931 , nearly 900,000 private automobiles entered national parks , sb and in many instances public camps were used by 30 per cent of the visitors , overnight campers outnumbering visitors registered in hotels . Those who might choose to spend the night away from home would , of course , represent only a small per cent of pleasure-bent Americans on the move , because the majority of them would have only a few hours of leisure time . During the warm weather some of these would // FAMILY BEHAVIOR undoubtedly go to public beaches , swimming pools , or to playgrounds provided by municipalities and would find many opportunities for active play : fields set aside for baseball and similar games , golf courses and tennis courts maintained at public expense ; facilities for water sports , archery and lawn bowling ; picnic grounds and other inducements to join their neighbors in public recreation . Those who might not care to engage in active sports could find many games which could be viewed from the sidelines . Those who are interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively large group of modern Americans who tend to spend their leisure hours away from home , but studies of recent trends indicate a decline in their numbers . According to Steiner , sc " The most striking fact about athletic sports today is not the cheering crowds on the sidelines but the large numbers of players , both young and old , men and women , who are eager to improve their own game in competition with their fellows . In view of the insistent and growing demand for greater opportunities to participate in athletic sports and games , it seems absurd to maintain that Americans are becoming a nation of spectators . " * We have been attempting to suggest a few of the many inducements which are offered to the modern family to encourage both children and adults to spend their leisure time away from home and in crowds . No one would deny that the development of public recreational facilities is // one of the outstanding achievements of modern society and that the commercial amusement world is contributing its share to human happiness . The challenge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater because of these developments . With time to spare and so many inducements to " go places " it looks as though the average American might continue to go until he literally " drops in his tracks , " neglecting almost entirely the quieter , less crowded and more individual leisure interests which might be discovered at home . In a familiar old story , an adventurous youth leaves home in search of a hidden treasure and after traveling far and enduring many hardships , he returns home and finds the treasure in his own back yard . The modern youth in search of leisure experiences , is in many respects like the hero of the moralizing tale , but the story would need to be re-written if the modern pursuit of leisure were to be stated in allegorical form . In one version of the tale the adventurous youth would continue his search until he became so old and worn that he would be obliged to return home , and then , to point the moral , we should probably have him sitting beside the buried treasure , knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a more cheerful and less moralizing version we should add a new character to the cast , an older and wiser man or woman who knows that the treasures of leisure are scattered , some at the fireside , some in the backyard , and some in more remote places ; and under the guidance of this older , wiser person , we should have the youth reverse the order of events , beginning his treasure hunt at his own doorstep . // NEEDED IN THE FAMILY-A PHILOSOPHY OF LEISURE If it were possible to tell the true life story of a man or woman who seems to find in leisure activities a source of engrossing interest and enduring satisfactions , it would be a story of learning experiences , many of them beginning in infancy and continuing today . If a parallel history could be written of a normal person who appears to be making scant use of his leisure opportunities , his story too would be one of learning experiences , but in his case there would probably be little to indicate that his leisure learnings had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin with the infancy of the subjects , and in each case the early chapters would portray an active , alert infant with plenty of time to play and a great zest for exploration ; for the healthy baby , when given half a chance , can be happily occupied when left alone among pots and pans , spools , spoons , or other household accessories which can be handled readily and moved about . But pots and pans can not satisfy the growing needs of an active toddler who is eager to try out his powers in a world which , so far as he is concerned , seems to be made solely for discovery ; and the life stories of the two subjects would probably begin to differ radically at this point because of basic differences in the attitudes of the adults who have been responsible for their early guidance . The average child , according to an estimate made by the United States Office of Education , spends only 9.85 per cent of his time in school , 8.33 per cent at meals , 37.50 per cent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free for his leisure experiences . The adult who believes that education for leisure begins in the cradle and continues // through life , will lose no opportunity to provide for the growing child a rich environment which he may explore , and the guidance necessary to help him to maintain a zest for discovery in a world of people as well as things . This is one of the chief reasons why the modern family needs a philosophy of leisure ? a philosophy which enables adults and older children to establish goals for those who are too young to establish their own . A philosophy of leisure is needed also by the person who is interested in planning a new program of leisure activities for himself , regardless of his age . Modern studies of adult learning ' have shown the possibilities of changing habits after reaching years of maturity . The adult who may have been deprived of many rich leisure experiences in childhood , can still discover in his hours of freedom from work , engrossing interests which will add materially to the worthwhileness of life . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should do in order to find enjoyment through leisure . All sorts of suggestions may be made ; a man may be taken to an art museum , to a concert or to the opera , but nobody can make him like it . The leisure activities which bring pleasure to some would make others acutely unhappy . In the case of the adult , the problem of adjusting to the new leisure is one which he must solve for himself , because enjoyment is the first measure of worthy leisure , and permanent personal satisfactions the final goal . There is another reason why the modern family needs a philosophy of leisure which can be shared by adults and older children ? it would help them to live together more harmoniously and more creatively . If each one should // believe that leisure is to be judged in terms of what any one individual may get out of it , the chances of mutual understanding among members of the family would be greatly enhanced . The parent , for example , who from his more mature standpoint might regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it possible to substitute activities which would meet the same basic needs ; and the adolescent who might otherwise regard his parents ' choice of leisure as " old fogy " would stand a better chance of appreciating what conservative interests might mean to those who choose them . If each member of the family should subscribe to the one belief that the real measure of leisure pursuits is the permanence of satisfaction which they may be made to yield , it would be possible for the family to plan as a group for creative leisure interests which all could enjoy . TIME-KILLERS AND PASTIMES There are not many persons who are able to analyze their own motives in choosing certain types of leisure activities in preference to others , and the one who stands on the side lines and watches can do no more than guess at the motives of his fellows . For this reason it would be foolish to attempt any but a suggestive analysis of the permanence of the satisfactions which various kinds of leisure pursuits might be made to yield . Many of the leisure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest and contribute little to personal growth . According to one estimate , 10 about forty per cent of the leisure activities of a group of men and women was classified as " pastime " or short-interest pursuits . A few // illustrations of time-passing leisure may serve to stress the difference between long-time and short-time interests . An old-fashioned method of " amusing " the baby was to put a drop of molasses on the pointer finger of each hand and to give him a feather . As the infant tried to remove the feather from one finger , only to find it sticking to the other , we can imagine his temporary interest in the curious object , ? and we can also picture the finality with which he must suddenly have abandoned the task and demanded new forms of entertainment . It is about as good an illustration of time-killing leisure as could be found , because the activity of removing feathers from sticky fingers seems to lead nowhere ? neither to new ways of manipulating feathers nor to the discovery of new sources of interest in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to serve the same limited purpose as the molasses-feather enterprise of the infant . The bored traveler , for example , often works on a cross-word puzzle or cryptogram , only to cast it aside , unfinished , when he reaches his destination . The story , half-read , often suffers the same fate , and only the attendant on a public vehicle knows how many newspapers are abandoned when their time-killing purpose has been served . Activities of this type often meet a real need and doubtless save many an impatient soul from a sense of frustration when he is obliged to submit to a time schedule which is not of his own choosing . No one can afford to assume a too critical attitude toward such fragmentary interests , but all would benefit , no doubt , from an effort to recognize them for what they are worth and to assign them only a small place in planning a leisure program . // Entertainments such as watching motion pictures , listening to the radio or reading mystery stories are difficult to define in terms of short-time versus long-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be almost completely forgotten tomorrow ; but on the other hand , the influence of a play , a book or a radio program may linger long after the details have been forgotten . This , of course , would apply to valuable as well as to questionable influences , and would probably apply more directly to children than to adults . In the studies of motion pictures to which reference was made in Chapter VI , there may be found many illustrations of the influence of motion pictures upon attitudes which appear to be more or less permanent . In one of the studies , one hundred and fifteen feature pictures were analyzed as to content , and of that number fifty-nine showed killing technics , and fifty-nine portrayed intoxicated persons . Children witnessing the pictures would be almost sure to carry away a changed or reinforced attitude toward crime and drinking . In many instances carelessly chosen entertainments are likely to encourage the fixation of false impressions . An English writer , " &; commenting on this danger , says that when he mentions Chicago in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know little about Chicago beyond the fact that it is supposed to be a city of gangsters . Taking motion pictures as illustrative of various short time entertainments , one other significant carry-over may be discovered . The man or woman who is solving a puzzle or reading half-heartedly in order to relieve boredom or // lessen the dissatisfaction of waiting , is probably not much stirred emotionally . This is not always true of the person who goes to a movie to pass the time pleasantly , and finds himself participating vicariously in the stress and strain presumably endured by the screen actors . Nature has . endowed man with various ways of meeting excitement with action . When one is emotionally stirred , the body makes all sorts of preparations for speedy and strenuous activity . Everyone knows what it is to have his " heart in his mouth " when experiencing prolonged and acute suspense ; or of feeling strange sensations in the pit of the stomach and a queer sense of weakness in the knees when confronted by fear-inspiring situations which he is not ready to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage , on the screen or in a book , may become as much excited as if he were witnessing similar scenes in real life and may be as much in need of active outlet . The person who gasps when the hero leaps from a high cliff , clutches his neighbor when the villain seems to be about to succeed in his ruthless scheme , and gasps audibly when the camera shows two trains about to meet head-on , furnishes ample evidence of the emotional tension possible in entertainment and the need of some kind of outlet . In order to gather some scientific evidence of bodily changes induced by exciting pictures , Dysinger and Ruckmich , 13 with carefully arranged apparatus , measured changes in the subjects witnessing pictures . Younger children ( under twelve ) made the most marked bodily reactions to scenes of danger , and older youths responded more actively to scenes of love . Both groups proved the // who needs to escape from a sense of physical tension might much better choose to participate in active outdoor sports or games . Just how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sidelines may be regarded as a debatable point by some , but there can be no question about the advantages of feeling stirred and shouting over feeling stirred , and grinding one 's teeth , clenching the fists and " boiling inside , " without making a sound . One who seeks to run away from his own real life problems often finds in entertainments of the type just illustrated temporary means of escape . The imaginative person whose life is filled with frustrations can often identify himself with a fictitious character and , for an hour or more at a stretch , can pretend that his own problems are not real . There are doubtless times when most normal persons need to be carried away from the unpleasant demands of an exacting world , but a real danger threatens the one who depends too much on diversion from problems which must eventually be met if he is to stand any chance of attaining lasting peace of mind . Leisure activities which afford a means of temporary escape from boredom or from the uncomfortable demands of a world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their place in a scheme of planned leisure ; but one who is seriously trying to evaluate the many alternative ways of spending leisure , must in the interests of straight thinking , recognize the fact that escape implies running away from something . The vigorous games and sports which provide a normal outlet for physical energy which needs to be spent , however , are not to be confused // with quieter activities which afford an escape from real life problems without contributing in any way to their solution . It is safe to assume that continued flight would not prove to be satisfying to anyone whose leisure activities are mainly escapes of one kind or another . LEISIIRE FOR SELF-ENLARGEMENT In order to appreciate the common human need for selfdiscovery , one could do no better than to study the behavior of infants and young children . Soon after the baby learns how to handle objects we see him trying them out in various ways ? a rattle , for example , may be shaken ; banged , rubbed against the head , bitten , or perhaps thrown away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string or a ring on the mother 's hand , seem to suggest different activities as an investigative pointer finger reaches out to probe or touch lightly . Watch a baby who is big enough to sit on the floor while an adult builds a tower of blocks . Even the person who knows very little about infant behavior knows that the baby would probably not sit idly by while some one built numerous towers for him . The average baby would be likely to get into the game himself if he were not restricted and while he would not be able to build expert towers , he would soon show that he is entirely competent to knock them down . Every healthy infant who has reached the age of sitting alone will , if he is provided with a few manipulative objects , demonstrate many times a day the satisfaction which a very young person may derive through doing things with materials . One would not need to observe many infants , nor any one infant for a long time , before noting // the joy which seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is sometimes called " joy in being a cause , " and seems to persist into adult life in all normal cases . A few examples may serve to illustrate the tendency more fully . A child who can arrange dominoes in rows , ready to fall at the touch of a finger , apparently likes to see them drop , one by one . If we were to - offer to knock them down for him , we know that he would be almost sure to decline our offer with unquestionable emphasis . Making dominoes fall seems to be much more fun than just seeing them go . If we were to join a group of older children , taking with us an interesting toy which could be made to do a variety of things , we should not expect to be able to demonstrate the toy many times while the children looked on . We know that we should soon be mobbed by alert young experimenters , each one eager to see what would happen if he put his hand to the test . If work-a-day adults could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would grant themselves more opportunities to experience the joy which comes from " being a cause , " leisure would take on new and deeper meanings . The contrast between the interested child and the prosaic adult is thrown into high relief in an excerpt from Hambidge's14a discussion of Hands or Hooks . " Many of us nowadays make remarkably little use of our hands . They manipulate a knife and fork , hold a steering wheel , cling to a subway strap , turn the pages of a newspaper ; not much else . Hooks would do almost as well . " * // As a result of the catastrophe of unemployment which so many have had to face during recent years , there have sprung up throughout the country . many centers where one may go to find ways of using too large an allotment of unsought leisure . To some , the activities of such centers probably offer , at first , only a chance to forget their worries , but in many cases new enthusiasms are aroused , new powers discovered and new personal successes attained through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands , of course , ' but in the handicraft and art classes for adults provided by public schools , social centers and other agencies , an inquiring reporter could find numerous human interest stories in which hands have been the means of restoring selfconfidence and encouraging new outlooks on life . Hobbies of one kind or another seem to bear a close relationship to good personal adjustment under normal life conditions . Whether one is most deeply interested in making things , in learning about people , in exploring new fields , or in some other leisure activity , seems to matter little so long as he is deeply and continuously interested in something , and so , is able to maintain his zest for living . " Minerva " ( to quote Hambidge once more ) , " they say was born full grown and prematurely wise . She must have lost much of the fun of life . " * The person with a hobby stands a good chance of having fun as he goes along , and some kind of fun is essential to mental health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional stability had been given , were asked to tell about their hobbies . Among those who had been rated " unusually stable , " more than // eighty per cent were able to report hobbies , while in the " unduly nervous " group , only about forty per cent seemed to have hobbies . In the middle group , hobbies were reported in about sixty-eight per cent of the cases . There were differences noted also in the kind of hobby mentioned , as the teachers in the poorly adjusted group were more inclined to report hobbies which were closely related to their teaching . The value of a favorite occupation is not entirely personal . One who is interested in something is likely to be interesting , just as a bored person is sure to be-boring . In considering leisure activities which contribute to an expanding self , the social side of the problem can not be forgotten , and for illustrations of the social aspects of selfenlargement , we shall turn again to the infant and growing child . The baby who throws his rattle on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to pick it up often shows his delight in his ability to make things happen to people as well as to things . This seems to be one of the earliest forms of social experiment which is incidental to a program of self-discovery . Children in the nursery school sometimes display a similar delight in pitting themselves against their small companions , as in the case of a rotund little two-year-old who deliberately collided with less substantially built toddlers in order to bowl them over . This level of leisure activity is one which certainly does not commend itself to a thoughtful adult , and yet we do not have far to look for much larger editions of the round little experimenter who are still interested in proving their own strength against their associates . // We have reason to believe that every normal child would rather be approved by his companions than to be able to knock them about like tenpins , and that no normal adult would choose to be . against his worthy associates in preference to belonging to their group . The records of children 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with such phrases as " lookit , " " see me , " " watch me , " and " see what I 'm doing . " The explorations and achievements of the young child seem to require a commending audience if the child is to feel at all sure that his accomplishments are worth while . As he grows older he makes less definite demands for the approval of his associates , but unless his life is abnormal , he never outgrows it . A mature person does not ask for applause , nor for spoken commendation as he mingles with his fellows , but he does require continued proof that his place in a chosen group is secure . The competitive activities of childhood and later life provide normal opportunities for testing growing powers under friendly conditions , especially as personal competition gives way to group contests or to efforts to better one 's own record . While the satisfactions of any of these forms of competitive play appear to be reasonably prolonged , their place in a scheme of leisure planned for enduring satisfactions would probably not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plan of long-time leisure would no doubt want to give a larger place to solitary or companionable activities in which one need not be so self-conscious about his growth . FAMILY BEHAVIOR LEISURE FOR CONTACTS WITH A WORLD OF REALITY In attempting to show how a philosophy of leisure might help the modern family to evaluate activities in terms of lasting satisfactions , we have illustrated shorttime interests such as are discovered in pastimes ; needed escapes from boredom and from tensions which are not easily endured ; and leisure pursuits which make it possible for one to gratify a normal interest in his own growth , matching oneself against materials and people , eventually attaining a sense of security and self-confidence . We have indicated that leisure pursuits which lead one away from the realities of life are , in the long run , destructive to morale . There are so many absorbing interests to be discovered in contemporary life that one who plans , during his leisure hours , to become better acquainted with a tiny fragment of the world about him would be occupied during the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old age that his discoveries had only begun . One may choose from a world of challenging public affairs , a world of people , a world of ideas perpetuated in literature , a world of nature , a world of art or a world of human effort . Opportunities for enriched leisure are at hand for all who care to explore . It may mean more knowledge , more power , more companionship or more of many worth while personal assets . Perhaps we can best illustrate enduring leisure interests if we limit ourselves to the possibilities of using leisure in order to experience the deep and abiding satisfactions which one may feel when he knows that his appreciations are growing , and that he is learning to value some of the things that count most toward the sum total of human happiness . // There are quieter appreciations to be nurtured as one learns to contemplate the simpler beauties of life : a home garden , a secluded brook , a gay feather in the garbage man 's hat , a child 's simple faith in his parents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are the deeper and more stirring appreciations to be fostered as one learns to thrill at scenes of grandeur : a sunset or the mountains ; a challenge to social endeavor ; a beautiful painting , sculpture , or musical composition ; evidence of grandeur not only in human attainment but in human effort . A philosophy of leisure can not be defined for anyone , but a modern family which might be willing to try to evolve its own would undoubtedly be well repaid . SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY AND DISCUSSION 1 . Many of the work activities of early settlers in this country were necessarily cooperative , and brought neighbors together in friendly contact . Log-rolling , barn-raising and quilting , for example , were group activities . From historical narratives and records of early life in America , gather illustrations of social life through work . ( 1 ) List the group activities of men and those of women . Which seem to have had the greater opportunity to mingle with neighbors while working ? ( 2 ) Can you find any suggestions of our modern competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ) What types of work brought entire families together ? Can you draw a clean-cut line between the work activities of pioneers and the leisure activities of moderns ? What is the difference , if any ? 2 . In some communities some of the more thoughtful and more aggressive citizens have organized for action and FAMILY BEHAVIOR have attempted to define their own standards of social activity , recreation or public entertainment . ( 1 ) One group of parents whose children were " pace setters " in " society " decided that they would stand together on certain standards such as the hour to begin and the hour to close a dance . Under what conditions do you believe that an organized effort of this sort might succeed ? ( 2 ) In another situation , parents were organized in a determined effort to improve the standard of films shown in their town . What do you believe to be involved in such a program ? How might parents proceed and what difficulties would they be likely to encounter ? Could sons and daughters of highschool and college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 ) In another situation , a large group of leading citizens organized a community center and arranged programs of entertainment such as concerts , plays , interpretative dancing and lectures . In your opinion , would such an organized effort be likely to change the leisure habits of the majority of families in the community , or of some one person in the majority of families ? In all active programs such as the ones illustrated , what seems to be a basic need within families ? 3 . In many communities , libraries , art museums and other institutions which serve the public are offering to entire families many opportunities to enjoy an enriched leisure . The Toledo Museum of Ards is an excellent illustration because it is performing a distinguished service to such large numbers of adults and children . In one year ( 1934 ) , the total attendance at the Museum exceeded the assumed population of the city by more than one third . This represented an increase in attendance of ninety-nine per cent // during a five-year period . In 1934 , nearly four tenths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the community to the program offered by the Music Department shows that many families can and do enjoy " cultural " leisure . In one year the average attendance of children at the weekly Hour of Music for Children was two hundred and eighty-four : the next year it was four hundred . To quote from the report of the Music Depart-ment : " It is a policy of the Museum 's Music Department to stimulate children to creative and interpretative musical activity in as many ways as possible . To this end . two special groups were formed of members of the Children 's Class , one to make musical instruments . . . and the other to engage in choral singing . . . . Each group appeared at least twice during the season on Saturday morning programs . Also , in the.large class children able to do so were called upon to demonstrate musical instruments , to sing works of special composers , and in various ways to assume a definite active part in the making of music . Mimeographed sheets were handed out each week with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; each was graded , filed for future reference , and returned at the end of the semester . Suitable acknowledgment was given to all efforts , and special recognition rewarded those who excelled . " Adults also responded enthusiastically to the programs provided for them , if attendance statistics are evidence of enthusiasm . The average weekly attendance of adults at a class was ninety-seven one year and four hundred and twenty-eight the next . To quote again : " These hours of music for adults consisted partly of talks about music , and partly of performance of important works which should illustrate and exemplify the particular subjects under consideration . . . . Suggestions . . were given members of the class for supplementary study , and // books , scores and Victrola records from the Museum 's Music library were made available to anyone caring to use them . Another feature of the adult course was a Music Memory contest in which all could participate , both in recognizing familiar melodies , and in adding less wellknown but worthy musical literature to the fund of the familiar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Art has held regular concerts on Sunday afternoons , presented by musicians of Toledo . These have always been free to the public , and last year they were moved from the Auditorium , seating eight hundred and fifty persons , to the Peristyle , seating one thousand , five hundred . . . . This year the Music Department proposed and sponsored one program made up entirely of works of Toledo composers . The success of this effort merits a repetition of the same plan for the coming season . " Visit the Art Museum which is nearest to your home . What does it have to offer to families ? Is it well patron-ized ? ( 1 ) Do you believe that the average person could enjoy programs of music and other arts ? If so , how might you proceed to encourage such interests upon your own part or upon the part of other members of your family ? ( 2 ) How might the Arts be made to contribute to family unity as well as to individual enjoyment ? Who should be held mainly responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is it a public , a family or an individual responsibility ? 4 . In public schools throughout the country you can find night classes of adults engaged in all sorts of educative or creative activities . In one school in New York , for example , you might see an elderly Italian ex-banker , a shabby middle- // aged housekeeper , and a jobless youth working side by side , modeling with clay , " trying their wings " for the first time . In an adjoining room you might find a taxicab driver and an unemployed teacher of languages sitting together at their easels and drawing from life ; while not far away you might see a Russian Jew and a Swede hammering at metal as they work out a new pattern for costume jewelry . There is an interesting comradery to be noted among the ill assorted men and women who gather in schools of this type , although they have little in common except a desire to use their leisure creatively . Visit some such school in your community and engage the grown-up " scholars " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what satisfaction they are getting from their creative activities . In the light of your visit , what suggestions can you make for a planned leisure program in your own or in some other family ? 5 . We can not generalize broadly about the type of leisure activity which some other person may enjoy most but we can make an inventory of our own leisure pursuits and can examine them more or less critically to see what they may be worth to us . Make a rough classification of your leisure pursuits ( the things that you often do , just because you want to ) , under the following heads : Time-killers , mildly amusing but seeming to lead nowhere . Escapes from tension . Competitive , matching yourself against people . Exploratory , matching yourself against materials . Pure enjoyment , as of music , art or literature . Social contacts , enjoyment of interesting people . Other types which have not been suggested . ( 1 ) Under which heading are the greatest number of activities listed ? ( 2 ) Which activities seem to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observations contribute in any way to the formulation of a philosophy of leisure ? 6 . In writing an introduction to The Care and Feeding of Hobby Horses , 17a Walter B. Pitkin says : " To find yourself in leisure and to achieve the wellbalanced life , pay no attention to what other people tell you to do , or what you think you ought ' to do . Above all do n't seek everlasting self-improvement . Learn rather how to enjoy yourself . Find out how to play . Take nothing too seriously , least of all yourself . " * Does this advice conflict with the suggestion just made that you analyze your own leisure to see what it may be worth ? Can you reconcile a personal inventory with the suggestion that you should not take yourself too seriously ? 7 . In The Care and Feeding of Hobby Horses , 17b Calkins says : " There is something about a hobby which shuns the lime-light , that is personal and intimate and sequestered . Hobbies are neither drugs nor time-killers . The hobbyist should be neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) With these requisites of a hobby and a hobbyist in in mind , make a list of your hobbies , if any . ( 2 ) How might one begin to acquire a hobby or to feed a small and feeble one which he might have ? Do you believe that a family statement of its leisure philosophy should include something about hobbies ? What could you suggest ? 8 . C. D. Burns in Leisure in a Modern World , 12b says : " Leisure is an opportunity for hearing and seeing and feeling // realities that are not obvious in the world of breakfast and dinner . " * With this definition in mind , what types of activity could you classify as leisure ? ( 1 ) Would you include leisure for talk , for travel , for reading , for contemplation ? ( 2 ) Would a study of human motives , or observations of child behavior classify as leisure interests ? Do you believe that one may enjoy leisure in a true sense while dealing with realities ? Does leisure need to interfere with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing issues , planning , and thinking squarely ? Or does one need to run away from real life in order to enjoy leisure ? 9 . We have considered , in this chapter , some of the recreational opportunities which are provided for modern families at public expense : parks , playgrounds , camps , . beaches , and so on . Libraries , art exhibits , and concerts are also offered to the public , free-of-charge . The growth in recreational and cultural facilities , available to an increasing number of men , women , and children is regarded as one of the encouraging signs of the times . All such facilities are , of course , outside the home and induce individual members and , in some instances , entire families to spend their leisure in going places . ( 1 ) Is it possible that a movement toward greater facilities for the use of leisure may , in the long run , harm some families while it is helping others ? ( 2 ) Can you think of any organized public program which would tend to balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of their leisure time at home ? ( 3 ) With the situation as it is today in most communities , if you were responsible for a family of your own , what would you do to offset the many inducements to leave home ? // Do you believe that education for leisure is a public responsibility ? Is it an educational problem which each family must solve for itself ? Is it both ? 10 . Hambidge140 writes : " If the day of physical pioneering is done , the day of mental and spiritual pioneering is far from done . " * Does this suggest one way of explaining the expression New Leisure ? // ADJUSTING TO COMMUNITY LIFE In scanning some of the traditional problems of families in a modern setting we have noted their interdependence and a common tendency for families to follow along with the crowd whenever they have opportunities to choose what they shall do or what they shall believe . We have examined some of the high-pressure influences to which widely differing families are commonly subjected , and have observed a conflict between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have pictured a modern setting in which old problems assume . new aspects , but we have not stressed the possibility of making changes in the setting . In much that they do , modern families appear to be unable to do little more than to adjust as best they can to life in the community as they find it , but if we were to observe closely we should discover that families are adapting upon different levels . There are , in every locality , highly susceptible families which seem to be wax in the hands of their neighbors . They allow others to tell them what they should want and how their wants are to be satisfied . They submit easily to high-pressure forces which tend to mold public opinion according to a common pattern . Even in their beliefs and in their roughly drawn moral codes , they tend to be uncritical and ready to follow ' a chosen crowd . There are other families , fewer in number , which are less plastic . They , too , go // with the crowd much of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their eyes open as they go . In this chapter we shall suggest levels of adaptation : to neighbors , to forces in the community which tend to cause many persons to think alike on popular questions , to old institutions which conserve the thinking of past generations , and to social problems which can be solved only through united and thoughtful action . The point of view maintained should be considered as one person 's opinion of how families , as organized units , might achieve a better community and the levels outlined should be taken for what they may be worth in stimulating discussion . ADAPTING TO NEIGHBORS SUSCEPTIBILITY TO TRADITION Among families living in remote rural situations , such as the one studied by Schanck ( see pages 126 , 127 ) , we find one aspect of extreme susceptibility illustrated . In communities of this type various attitudes , which the modern young person would term " old-fashioned , " are to be noted . Residents in many such villages appear to be unusually loyal to traditional beliefs and customs . They belong to the church to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vote according to the party preferences of their fathers ; and they maintain certain social beliefs which appear to change little with each succeeding generation . Outside influences such as the press , radio , and screen undoubtedly reach dwellers in conservative communities of this type , but not with sufficient persuasion to bring about radical changes in popular thought . // New social standards , new political loyalties and new ethical codes develop slowly in conservative communities because they are the result of new experiences , and usually involve new personal contacts . In some remote rural communities new personal contacts are rare ; there is little to encourage new families to move in , bringing with them fresh interests and incentives to new ways of behaving in the community group . There is also little to hold younger members of old and established families , when they become old enough to support themselves . In their everyday behavior and in their thinking along social lines , many intelligent older men and women tend to get into a rut , because there is so little to challenge new interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of analysis ) to a lower level of intelligent adaptation to the community , are probably families which have had but limited opportunity to make new social contacts . In a village such as the one studied by Schanck , a socially progressive teacher , minister , or other leader who could establish himself as a well liked or highly respected member of the community , could no doubt exert marked influence upon public thinking , and he might do much to offset a blind allegiance to untested traditions . If , for example , one popular person were to attempt to break down an unquestioning acceptance of the ideal of militant patriotism which our ancestors found necessary , it would probably be by way of friendly contacts . Those who thought well of him would be willing to listen to his opinions . Because of this well-liked person 's anti-war attitude , certain neighbors would turn on the radio when // a speech on war propaganda could be heard , or they . might read short discussions of the question in newspapers or periodicals . As a result of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the radio , some of the leading families in the community might be induced to add their voices to his . Thus , little by little , by means of personal contacts reinforced by other community influence , a " lower level , " too receptive family might be encouraged to function on a higher , less docile plane of social adaptation . SUSCEPTIBILITY TO MODERN INFLUENCES Fortunately , our scheme of illustrative levels does not make it necessary to say whether the family which adheres strictly to traditional influences is functioning on a higher , or on a lower plane than one which is equally susceptible to modern high pressure influences . Uncritical acceptance of community influences seems in either case to be representative of a relatively low level of social adjustment . Families which follow along unquestioningly in the footsteps of pioneers in American life are usually to be found in communities which are more or less remote , whereas those which seem to be unusually gullible or pliant when subjected to modern influences are likely to be living in less settled , more active urban communities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going with the crowd , with its eyes only half-open . If a family , functioning on a level of extreme gullibility and susceptibility , were to follow the crowd in every possible way , we should have some such exaggerated // picture as the following . Whether the earners in the family could afford a car or not , they would probably have one , even though it might not be paid for , because " everybody has a car in these days . " In the living room we might expect to see overstuffed furniture , carefully matched as to upholstery , an exact replica of a " set " shown in store windows , and glowingly described in mail order catalogues . This family , of course , would have a radio and members would be somewhat indiscriminate in their selection of entertainment ? jazz , orchestras , crooners , comedians , numerologists , and dramatic sketches of hairbreadth escapes from the most villainous of villains . During important political campaigns members of this family might listen for a short time to a speech made by a candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political party platform of their parents and grandparents , but should a representative of an opposing party claim the air , the dial would be speedily turned . In this family , members would be inclined to listen to the radio only as long as it might be possible to do so with a minimum of mental activity . This family would , of course , go to the movies en masse and individually and would tend to believe that the noble hero and sweet and tender heroine must triumph in the end . The newspaper would be read avidly , but with a high degree of selection . The harrowing details of crimes of violence and adventure would be given preference ; and on rare occasions a newspaper editorial which might fit without difficulty into a belief already held would be read and accepted at its face value . In expressing their likes // FAMILY BEHAVIOR and dislikes , members of this most susceptible family would entertain few middle-of-the-road attitudes ; they would " have no use at all " for certain races , religious groups or political party doctrines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by neighbors , vote as neighbors vote , buy what neighbors buy , and go where neighbors go . We might expect this family to have a hard time because of its readiness to follow , but while it is proceeding along the line of least resistance in following the crowd , it is just as impervious to minority influences as it is susceptible to forces which encourage a popular pattern of attitude and behavior . The social immaturity of some families which resemble the one sketched in exaggerated detail may be due , of course , to a childish mentality , but men , women and children of satisfactory learning capacity are often living on such a plane as this , mainly because they have had little experience in meeting community problems critically . Judged from the standpoint of scientific invention and growth in industrial activities , the community in which such impressionable families live is going forward much more rapidly than they . Everett Dean Martin ' compares the modern , uncritical social group of followers with barbarians of an earlier and less developed civilization . " If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is , since it is possible that a great many more people may yet attain intellectual maturity than have already done so ? the situation would seem to require , first that we recognize barbarian traits when we see them . " The first trait is that barbarians . . . come in hordes . // They look alike , they paint their faces alike , they use the same slang , indulge in the same passing fad , repeat the same standardized , **27;99;TOOLONG opinions , read the same tabloids , crave the same sensations , look at the same motion pictures , listen to the same radio programs . " Barbarians like big things . They do not discriminate . They want violent sensations. " * STANDARDS OF LIVING If everyone who followed the lead of his associates were to be classified as a " barbarian " we should have no one left to represent our higher level group . It is human nature to follow , to want to do what others do , and to want others to think well of us . The chief difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one who adjusts on what we have chosen to call a higher level is that this relatively superior person does not follow all the time and that he is somewhat more discriminating in his choice of whom he is to follow . The family which struggles so hard to " keep up with the Joneses " is , for example , not to be classed with the unthinking horde even though it is often not very intelligent in its efforts . The object of many jokes and the inspiration for numerous preachments , this family is not altogether undiscriminating . Its members do choose from many patterns which they might strive to copy . It is the Joneses whose standards of living are higher than their own rather than a family of lesser estate that is allowed to set the pace . Of course , there are many difficulties // involved in following any group slavishly , and individual members of a family which strives to meet too many of the standards of the more prosperous Joneses are sure to find their adjustments hard . Nevertheless , if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbors lived our general standards of living would improve more slowly than they do . Conveniences and opportunities which were not dreamed of in simpler days are now taken for granted . What would once have been regarded as luxuries , have come to be considered among the necessities of life . What does the " middle " family in the United States want ? What , according to present ideals , are its standard needs ? * This family , a father , mother , daughter aged 17 and a son aged 8 , wants a house with three bedrooms , a living room , dining room , kitchen , bath and a one-car garage . It is in the middle section of the United States . It costs $5000 and the lot costs $1000 . The family is buying the house with the help of the FHA . It will take twenty years to pay for it . The annual cost of the house , including house furnishings and operating expenses , is $724.72 . The family wants to be healthy and well fed , so asks for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg a day for each member of the family , a small allotment of meat and vegetables , a pint of milk for each adult and a quart for each child . To buy this food costs $845 a year . All members of the family need clothes : clothes for // work , for sports , and for special occasions . These can be bought for $345 a year if the mother exercises considerable ingenuity . The mother wants to spend $5 a year on one or two permanents and she wants $3 for lipstick , powder , rouge and so forth . The daughter asks for $20 a year for similar needs . The father wants shaving cream . They all want soap and tooth brushes . It costs $56.85 a year to give this family a reasonable amount of personal care . In order that its members may maintain their health the family needs to pay $50 a year for each member for medical and dental service . Of course the family wants a car and it costs $850 . In order to keep the car going , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is $324.65 . The family needs recreation . The parents go to a movie once a month , the children once a week . ? If they play tennis or golf it is on a public court or course . Once a year the family has an inexpensive two-weeks vacation , but once in ten years demands are not satisfied so cheaply and the family travels . Vacations , on the average , cost $100 a year . All recreation costs $225 . Among the standard needs of this family are expenditures for the education of each one . It buys school supplies , newspapers , magazines and a few books . There is a piano in the home but sheet music must be bought and phonograph records . Occasionally lecture and concert tickets appear to be essential to a fair educational program . Allowing for a few extra investments such as a small picture or ornament , this family needs at least $100 a year for education and cultural advancement . // In order to hold its place in the community the family must make contributions to various charitable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A reasonable amount to be set aside for savings and investments is $300 annually . All told , to meet demands which are considered standard this family must have an income of $3200 a year , $800 for each member . Such is the present American " middle " standard of living which is based upon common needs and expresses the desire of the normal person to live as well as his neighbors live and to enjoy the comforts which his neighbors enjoy . Standards for the middle family and " average " income are , unfortunately , out of balance . Take shelter alone , for example . If the actual average family spent what is necessary to live according to the standard , almost a third of our national income would be spent for shelter . If the average family spent and saved the $3200 necessary to meet all " middle " standards , our national income would have to be increased thirty-five billion dollars . This is the situation confronting families of today . What is to be done about it ? Let us test out our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior of barbarians as illustrative of an unthinking and uncritical level of following the lead of neighbors . We have suggested that families which elect to pattern after the Joneses are more discriminative in their following and that they are concerned about bettering their standards of living . On a higher level we might find families concerned not only with their own but with group standards of living . They would also be interested in many kinds // of standards : moral and religious , esthetic and cultural , to mention only an illustrative few . DIFFERENCES PROVE INTERESTING There is , of course , no royal road to good social adjustment but , in some families which are functioning on a relatively high level of social adaptation , a knowledge of the essential variation in human experiences might well be used as a protection against high-pressure influences which tend to sweep the too gullible person off his feet . A program of home education might well be based upon . the assumption that a sustained interest in differences to be discovered among one 's friends and neighbors would prove to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family interested in making such an experiment , adults would begin while the children in the family are very young to point out different kinds of work to be done in the community ; different ways of celebrating holidays ? among Jews and Gent* , for example ? or among families of different racial origin ; differences in the play preferences of neighboring children ; differences . among children and adults in what they believe to be right or desirable in their social relationships . Within the family the same procedure could be followed in recognizing differences in preference for radio programs , for example , or for games to be played and stories to be read . " Difference dilemmas " would be met , in this family , as the necessity for interpretation might arise . Thus , casually and by means of actual experiences , children would be guided in the development of social habits which should make it easier for them to adjust to a world of conflicting ideas and ideals . // A good example of a program of this type is to be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guiding principle of interest in differences among her young charges . She noted that most of the children in her group appeared to be annoyed when some child told a folk tale in a form which differed in some way from the versions familiar to the other children . She discovered a tendency to believe that any version which was a modification of the tale as any one child had heard it was necessarily wrong . She recognized the opportunity for encouraging a discriminative interest in various ways of telling the same story , so she explained how folk tales had come down by word of mouth , and how they have been changed in the telling so that it is difficult to say which version is right and which one wrong . Instead of insisting somewhat smugly upon an exact repetition of stories as they had first heard them , the children soon began to say , " Is that the way you heard it ? My mother told it to me this way . " Interest in differences is often a first step toward a better acquaintance with persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and researches suggest that acquaintance is often a first step toward tolerance . In a study of prejudices common among different nationality groups , Diggins asked foreign and American students to rate ten national groups according to their art achievements , their industrial progress , the student rater 's personal preference for members of the race , and his willingness to live in a neighborhood in which all families were of the specified race . Students were also asked to state how many members of the nationality group // they had known and whether they had known them on their own native soil . There appeared to be a clear tendency for a person to rate a group relatively high if he had been acquainted with members of the group on their own soil . If they had known a member of a group intimately and pleasantly , students tended to favor this group more than groups whose members were all strangers to them . Acquaintance with two members of a nationality seemed to predispose raters more favorably than acquaintance with one , and acquaintance with three seemed to encourage even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of neighborly attitudes , and pleasant acquaintance is undoubtedly a stronger one . ADAPTING TO NEWER INFLUENCES IN THE COMMUNITY A relatively low level adjustment to the press , radio and similar pressures in a modern community has already been considered in Chapter VI . In order to , , . feet such forces on a higher level , it seems to be necessary that one should , first of all , recognize the fact that life in a modern community tends to encourage stereotyped and uncritical attitudes toward social questions . There seems to be a parallel between acquaintance with neighbors as a first step toward good adjustment , and acquaintance with the high pressures of modern living . Two experimental studies , one of reaction to propaganda , and one ' of the development of a discriminative attitude toward motion pictures , suggest how a family might proceed to safeguard its members from forces which tend to cause families in a community to think en masse. // DEVELOPING A CRITICAL ATTITUDE TOWARD PROPAGANDA While no one person can stem the tide of propaganda after it has started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent person to develop a critical attitude toward specific propagandist materials , so that he need not be swept off his feet . That such an attitude can be developed is illustrated in a study reported by Biddle . ' This study of the attitudes of high-school and college students suggests that gullibility is often due to the fact that propaganda influences are not recognized as such . Biddle prepared a series of articles to be used as a measure of uncritical acceptance of popular attitudes . He submitted the articles to students before attempting to awaken them to a realization of the fact that they were often inclined to be docile in their acceptance of certain social opinions . Following the initial test of gullibility , students were given a series of exercises which had been prepared to encourage a critical attitude toward propaganda influences . As a measure of the success of the exercises ( practice in judging popular viewpoints critically ) , a test of certain national and international attitudes was given , and seventy-four per cent of the students showed improvement in the independence of their thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably no one social institution in the modern community which challenges the credulity of the socially inexperienced person more than the motion picture . In the first place , it presents human nature in such extremes that an interest in ordinary , humdrum everyday acquaintances is discouraged , and an impartial atti- // tude toward controversial questions is made unlikely . In a family which might be considered illustrative of a relatively high level of adjustment to the press , radio , and screen , adults would find it necessary to combat a common tendency to believe that social issues are to be analyzed on a basis of " all the right on one side ? and all the wrong on the other . " The screen adds to their difficulty , but they would need to meet each problem as it arises , pausing to comment upon a particular picture , explaining to younger members that " life is really not like that , but it makes a good story , " or " motion pictures very often show only one side of a character . " Studies reported in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as tolerance of crime or intolerance of certain racial groups . Adults in a family which functions on a level somewhat higher than average in the community , would need to be constantly on the alert for danger signals such as the one sounded by the boy who said that gangsters are very often " good . ' guys . " Once more the wise parent , or older brother 6r sister would be called upon to explain that scenario writers and producers often care more about a good story than about real life experiences . We should not expect a family of this type to stay away from motion picture theaters , even though there are some aspects of the industry which a thoughtful person would like to change , because the problem of this family , as of every other , is to adapt to life as it is , while developing means of bringing about slow changes and discovering ways of making good personal adjustments through discriminative reactions . // The modern school moves slowly , however , in its effort to discourage crime , war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nationalism . When the progressive adult hears the challenge of the reformer who is crying out against the slow movement of the school , and examines with him some of the outworn practices which still persist in some situations , he will no doubt agree that citizens everywhere need to study their schools and that national and international , social , and economic problems are essentially school problems ; but when it comes to a consideration of the best means of accelerating the progress of the school , he can not fail to see that public opinion is somewhat divided . Analysis of textbooks used in teaching history has often revealed a tendency upon the part of some writers of history , and upon the part of those who choose textbooks , to present only one side of controversial questions . The Revolutionary War could never have been fought if our forefathers had not believed that they were fighting on the side of Right , nor for that matter , if the English had not believed that our countrymen were wrong and that theirs was the noble cause . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most social issues need to be examined from all angles . The modern school is attempting to put more impartial texts into the classroom and to encourage discussions of controversial questions ; but in many localities teachers are meeting with strong opposition from parents and others who are intensely loyal to traditions . The storm which was created by the trial of an evolutionist in the South is a case in point . 302
