A U.S. carrier task force steamed west . In the grey dawn , some 1,200 miles from Tokyo and well inside the perimeter of Japan 's outer defenses , the big flattops turned their noses into the wind . From their flight-decks planes rose and headed for Marcus Island , a little apple tart lying on the blue spread of the Pacific . <P> Americans had called on Marcus before . In 1902 an expedition from Honolulu put in to the island with the hope of finding guano deposits . A Japanese marine force barred them . The Japs finally allowed the party to land under heavy guard , let a scientist pick up some wildlife specimens ; then gave them some water and coconuts and sent the whole outfit packing . Forty years later a U.S. task force attacked Marcus and smashed Jap hangars , runways , ammunition dumps ( TIME , April 6 , 1942 ) . But last week 's raid was bigger . <P> The Tokyo radio crackled out : " Many enemy planes raided Minami Tori shima+ at dawn today . " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but added : " No report has been received from the raiding force and it is presumed that there will be none until need for radio silence ceases to exist . " Except for a second broadcast from Tokyo that 90 " Grumman fighters " and " about 60 carrier bombers " and two carriers had taken part in the assault , the silence was still unbroken at week 's end . The attack could have had one or a number of objectives : <P> &gt; To give Tokyo a fright . Tokyo did indeed broadcast to its people a warning that " the enemy could have raided the mainland if he had wanted to . " <P> &gt; To cover other operations : for example , a U.S. landing on Wake . <P> &gt; To carry out the Pacific Fleet 's strategy of stabbing around the perimeter to draw out the Jap fleet . <P> &gt; To destroy installations . Marcus , only five miles around , nevertheless supports three airplane runways , can be used as a base of operations against U.S. submarines , is useful as a link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wake . <P> The first strong carrier operation since the sinking of the Hornet in the Battle of Santa Cruz , October 1942 , the raid was proof of new U.S. strength in the Pacific . <P> +Japan 's name for the island speck , meaning " South Bird Island .
