One week last fall , many a U. S. armchair general , vicariously glorying in the dash and glamor of Stuart , Forrest and Sheridan , thought he saw cavalry go down forever with the evening sun . That first week in September the famed Polish cavalry threw itself into the path of the German mechanized columns , and was swept out of the way like rubbish . But hard-boiled military men , especially the Germans , knew that cavalry was still a long way from being scrap-heaped . The Poles ' mistake had been to use cavalry as striking forces rather than as screens and feelers . The Germans , no slaves to military tradition , used cavalry in the Lowlands and France , reportedly had a ratio of one horse to every three men . <P> The modern mission of cavalry is reconnaissance , screening advances , protecting flanks and rear in retreat . Men on horses still travel fast through woods , swamps , across streams where mechanized equipment can not go . Last week , on the tree-fringed parade ground at Fort Oglethorpe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full equipment showed its paces before leathery Brigadier General Charles L. Scott . <P> Past the reviewing stand trotted the Sixth Cavalry 's first squadron ( cavalry-talk for battalion ) : 424 horses carrying troopers armed with Garand rifles and automatic pistols , 48 pack horses loaded with machine and anti-tank guns . After them in a cloud of blue smoke snorted the second squadron : 68 armored scout cars , no motorcycles , trucks , rolling kitchens , ambulances . Spectators found the motor squadron old stuff . More interested in the horse squadron , they watched it trot up to 58 truck-trailer combinations , unsaddle , walk its mounts up inclined tail gates , tie them inside . Within 10 minutes horses were loaded eight to a trailer , troopers were aboard , the train pulled out . <P> More pleased than anyone at this exhibition was the Army 's Chief of Cavalry , long-legged , polo-playing Major General John Knowles Herr . Few weeks ago John Herr lost two of his crack outfits when the First and Thirteenth , long since mechanized , were transferred from the Cavalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Last week the National Guard Bureau announced that its 19 cavalry regiments would shortly trade in their hay-burners for gas-eating trucks and guns . <P> But this week the Sixth ( 60 officers , 1,132 men ) showed what a newfangled horse outfit could do in maneuvers in Louisiana ; and the lean troopers of the Fourth , now about three-fourths equipped , were doing the same thing in Minnesota . Still to be brought up to strength are eleven more regular Army regiments . Equipped to travel 130 miles in six hours on tires , able to cover 40 miles a day , weeks on end , under their own power , the Army 's modern horse outfits have many a spot in the hemisphere they can still call their own . For service in the swamps and woods of the southern U. S. , in the arroyos of the Mexican border , in the Rockies and the Appalachians , the man in the McClellan saddle thinks he can wipe the eye of any carburetor trooper , may yet have a chance to prove it .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
