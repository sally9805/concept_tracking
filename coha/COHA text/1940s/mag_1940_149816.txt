Last week the Democrats ' leader in the U. S. Senate , Alben Barkley of Kentucky , had something to say about the long-pending Logan-Walter Bill . " I still am not sure , " said Mr. Barkley , " what its passage will do to all the agencies of the Government . . . . The more one discusses it , the less he understands it . " Brighter Senators than Alben Barkley agreed , wearily passed ( 27-to-25 ) a measure which could subject any act , rule , decision of such agencies as NLRB , SEC , FCC , TVA and many others to court review . <P> Having voted 3-to-1 for an earlier version , the House had already rejected the argument that the bill would not only " control " but stultify essential Federal functions . When Texas ' lemony , relentless Hatton Sumners called the Senate bill up for final passage by the House , hostile but hopeless Administration leaders had already given up . This week they let it pass ( 176-to-51 ) , expected a veto by Franklin Roosevelt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
