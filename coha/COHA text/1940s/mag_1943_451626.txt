as a place that one must fight through onto an uncomfortable train in order to get somewhere . It was strictly a means to an end for me , and I had always dreaded the process of shoving , waiting , and ( lodging . On the evening of April 1 , however , when I caught the " Jeffersonian " to leave Washington for good , I loved the whole familiar , dull procedure . At the train gate I waited longer than usual , a whole hour , and the waiting mob packed me in more solidly than I had ever been packed . But the sta lion building seemed lofty and exciting , and I enjoyed every minute of the waiting . When the train gates finally opened , I lugged my bags clown the length of the platform , smiling at the sprinting soldiers who flashed by me , I was even amused , for a change , when I found my car was , as usual , the last and most bedraggled of a long line of bedraggled coaches hooked on behind a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my chair , which turned out to be stuck in a permanently reclining position , and I tipped him lavishly and settled back to look around me . The people who milled through the aisles were soldiers carrying their small canvas bags , businessmen weary after a day of priority seeking , and women in flowery spring hats . The confusion was considerable , as all the seats in the car were reserved , and finding the numbers on them entailed unbuttoning and peering under the railroad COM pony 's neat white antimacassars . I speculated who among this crowd was to be my seat companion for the next day and night , hoping it would n't be the particularly imperious lady with two fur coats over her arm who was haggling with her porter ; hopeful that it might be the stocky soldier who reminded me of my brother-in-law as he lazily searched for his seat . But I did n't spot the girl who , it turned out , was to sit next to me , until , with a flurry of tweed coat , slim high heels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught a glimpse of exceptionally white skin , red hair under a white turban , and curiously red . dened eyes , and then she turned her head away , Suddenly , as though realizing that , for better or worse , we were to be together for the next twenty-four hours , she looked at me and smiled , and I noted that she had a pretty face , made up of individually unpretty features . She introduced herself as Tracy Mead , told me she was a government worker , and offered me a stick of chewing gum . In less than thirty minutes , I was showing her a picture of my husband . He had sent me the picture ? taken at one of Camp Hickory 's quick photo places ? saying : " The only backdrop they had , honey , was a cutout of a large , fat man in a bathtub . If I had had my head attached to his body in the approved manner , it might have been a better picture , at that . " The picture showed him standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his new GI cap was obviously too big . But it was my only photograph of Spencer in uniform , and I had shown it to a surprising number of people . " Gosh , " Tracy said . " lie 's a good-looking boy . Has he been in long ? " I explained that he had bees drafted six weeks before . " And you 're going out to live with him while he 's in training ? " " I 'm going to live as close as possible , " I said . Tracy said she was taking two weeks annual leave from her government job ; and knowing how difficult it is for government workers actually to get those days of leave that pile up on paper for them , I asked her how she had managed it . Immediately I realized 1 had asked the wrong question , for tiny red veins began to appear under her white skin , and I thought she was going to cry . She pulled a telegram out of her purse and handed it to me . Even before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top told me that it was a death notice . It was her brother , killed on a high-tension wire . She had been called home for the funeral . Either by determination or by the process of confiding in someone , Tracy 's distress seemed to he wiped away . My condolences were clumsy , but Tracy seemed grateful , and she chatted with nervous animation about her brother , her home , and her parents . Her face softened when she told one about her fiance , an aviation cadet who was stationed at an air base near her home in Texas . " After the funeral , " she said , " I think I 'll sneak in a visit to him . And , you never can tell , he may just decide I should stay . It certainly would n't break my heart to leave Washington . " She showed me her picture of him , which was as bad as mine of Spencer , and I was equally polite . Within an hour we load exchanged addresses , traded cigarettes , and were friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoyances of our particular agencies , and groaned over housing conditions . " I like Washington all right , " Tracy said , " but gee , it costs such a lot to live there . Why , I did n't even have a fur coat when I canoe , and you know , there are so ninny places that you just feel funny going to if you do n't have a fur coat . " We stopped talking about ourselves to watch two lieutenants squirming in their seats across the aisle . They had had to put their suitcases under their feet because the baggage rack had already been stuffed with dutffil bags when they boarded the train . Now they were trying to find some comfortable way to tit both feet and bags into tine limited space . I glanced at the two soldiers behind them ? the owners of the duffel bags ? wino were watching tine Joist ( ) mime . One of them winked . Tracy giggled and stretched her legs . " I hope those gold braids are going a long way , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . It 's good for them after the way they march around Washington like little tin gods . " Tracy 's enjoyment of their discomfort was based on six months of working for the War Department.2 TRACY had already had dinner , so I set out alone to walk tine gauntlet of soldiers between our car and the diner , trying not to grin at their whistles . Standing cramped in the little entrance hallway to the diner , dodging back and forth to let the hurried but imperturbable waiters get glasses out of the cabinets , I waited a good hour . A slight and elderly private talked to me with excessive politeness , and a drunken sailor , who was pocketing glasses every time the cabinet was opened , reeled around inc . " I 'm just back from the Solomons , " he said . " Furlough , fifteen-day furlough . Have a glass . " 1 did n't want a glass , so he pocketed that one , too . " Just in case , " he said . They made stiff lumps under his snug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier got between the sailor and me , and bowing slightly from the waist , he introduced himself and asked me to have chimer with John . It turned out that Itaska ? the town I was headed for ? was twelve miles away from where his wife lived . He wrote out her address for me ? forming his letters with the same slow care he used in talking and eating . Later that evening , he found one in my seat , and wanted me to read his wife 's latest letter . She was a devout woman , who had turned to God completely when he had gone , he told me . " She 's very fine , very Christian , " he said . " She 's just the finest little wife in the world . " I saw pictures of her and his children . Tine letter , full of stilted intimacies , embarrassed me as though I had broken into their bedroom by mistake , and I knew my smile was growing stiff on my face . It was a relief when he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club car . A soldier wino was also trying to get in braced himself against the jolting of the train and talked to us . " So you 're going to hickory , " he said . " Your husband must be in tine Signal Corps . " I said he was . Tine soldier shook his head . " Hickory 's a hell hole , " he said . " What 's Inc doing out there ? " I explained that he was in radio school . " That 's O.K. , " the soldier said . " He 'll get a good technical rating out of that . That 's the best thing to get in the Army . " " Better than being an officer ? " I asked . " Hell , yes , " he said . " What does an officer know ? When you 're a technician you can tell your officers which end 's up . " " Do you like the Army ? " I asked . " Guys do n't like the Army , " he answered soberly . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it is. 1 get mighty tired of these damn uniforms , though . " I fe brushed his hand impatiently against his pants , and then grinned . " Hell , I wish I had a wife , " he said . " The Army 'd be all right that way . " " Do you think it 's a good idea to go out and live near my husband ? " I was fishing for assurance . " What else ? " the soldier said . " It 's a wonderful break for a guy . " I could feel my face getting red with pleasure . The lights were out in the coaches when we started back to our car , and we fumbled our way down the aisles , brushing against outtlung arms and feeling our way from chairback to chairback . When we found our scat , Tracy went right to sleep , curled like a pretzel in her chair . She tended to uncurl during the night , but she did n't wake when I carefully extracted an elbow that drifted over into my ribs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stepping over a sleeping soldier who was lying across the doorway like a watchdog . It took a long time to get into the diner again , and I found the sailor with the bulging glasses under his blouse waiting there , too . He appeared to have been there all night . He wanted us to have a good-morning drink , and he pulled out innumerable glasses , polished them neatly with his handkerchief , and offered them to the hungry crowd . Not to be outdone , a few male civilians took him up on it . We got into St. Louis about four , two hours late , just in time for me to board my train for Kansas City . Tracy who had to wait over between connections  --  saw me off , and I waved to the slight , redheaded figure on the platform , knowing that we 'd probably never see each other again . 3 MY N Ew Irain was a streamliner ? not only the engine but also the coaches ? clean , slick , and comfortable ; and my car was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift of making themselves at home on trains as soldiers do . It was like stepping back to peacetime  --  no chatter , no moving around . The Kansas City station reminded me of Washington , and after spending ten nickels calling hotels for a room , I began to feel that the housing situation must be about the same , too . The soldiers and girls who had settled down on the station benches for the night , sleeping obliviously , seemed to have hit on the only solution . But wanting a bath and aching for a chance to take my shoes off , I decided to try the Travelers Aid . " Well , I think we can get you a room in a nice little family hotel , " one of the women at the booth said . " Would that be all right ? It is n't fashionable , but it 's very clean . " I said I 'd settle for any . thing which included a bathtub , and she clinched it with a telephone call . Her real concern for my comfort : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailors who shared my cab from the station . " You got a room through what ? " one of them asked . " Through the Travelers Aid , " I said . He apparently did n't understand the nature of the Travelers Aid . " Look , girlie , " he said , drawing out his wallet . " I can lend you some money . I know how it is to be broke . " He probably would have given it to me , too , though I was in fact so loaded down with cash and American Express checks that it almost scared me . Much to my embarrassment , when the cab stopped to let me off , the sailor took one look at my " little family hotel " and repeated his offer . It was certainly the tiredest-looking establish . ment I 've ever been in . It looked like a cross between the Y.W.C.A. and one of the better flophouses , But the lumpy bed seemed heavenly and I went right to sleep . In the station next morning , I began to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was to spend the next few months . Lugging baggage , tired and lonely , but all excited , they were going to see their husbands , some for a visit , sonic for as long as possible . They were mostly young , mostly well dressed , mostly attractive . That morning there were hundreds of us congregated in the Kansas City station . We stood in front of tine train gate , jockeying for position , waiting . It is n't only the men in the Army who get used to waiting ? the Army wives get used to it , too . Waiting in train stations , waiting for husbands who may be scouring pots in the mess halls and ca n't let us know . In time I was to learn the art of waiting ? of stretching out little tasks and insignificant thoughts . The slacks-clad girl I sat next to on the train was weary . Two clays on trains , a night spent in the Kansas City station " with a hell of a nice bunch of sailors , " had done the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week at Camp Lisle , " certainly the most godforsaken spot on tine globe , " she said . " I stayed at the guest house , " sine told me . " There is n't a town anywhere around . You ca n't imagine that place . The men were n't allowed to come up to our rooms , and you had to hide in a telephone booth to kiss your husband good night . I finally left before I had to . My husband said he was gelling frustrated . " I hoped it would n't be that bad at Hickory . The car I was in was filled with wives going to Itaska or Gladwyn , a smaller town closer to the camp , to visit their husbands . One girl was balancing a bakery box . " She 's carried that cake all the way from Oregon , " a girl told me . Another girl was holding a young baby , and was heavily pregnant with her next . In the car ahead of us were a number of selectees , branded by their lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fresh GI haircuts . We saw them trooping back and forth to the diner , led by a sergeant . They seemed young and subdued and a little frightened , like freshly sheared sheep being led to a sheep clip . I remembered everything my husband had told me about that trip , and I felt unexpectedly teary watching them . We all became silent as they filed through the car , and then giggled , embarrassed by our solemnity , when they were gone . In four hours , we reached Itaska and 1 took a cab to the Wilbur Hotel , where I was staying . There was a waiting line at the desk . I had a reservation , but after hearing the clerk with well-exercised sympathy turn away person after person who also thought he or she had reservations , 1 grow nervous . " We may have a cancellation later , " was the standard brush-off . " Just have a seat . We 'll call you . " A tall , imperious woman of about forty , casually wearing mink , fought for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel and Mrs. Thompson , " the clerk repeated after her . He searched for the reservation and found it . " Twin beds , Mrs. Thompson ? " he asked , in the brisk unconcerned way in width male drugstore clerks cater to intimate feminine needs . " No , " she said firmly . " A double bed , please . " The girl behind me nudged me . Luckily Spencer 's reservation had stuck , and I got into my room with no trouble . I was left to wait until evening , when he would arrive . I lingered over au indifferent sandwich as though it were a filet mignon . I bought a washcloth in the five and ten mat store , and kept the clerk an unnecessarily long time explaining Missouri 's state tax system to me . I wrote letters , bathed , napped , and finally allowed myself the luxury of dressing . When I had finished everything I had to read , had listened to voices in the hall until my stomach was churning with excitement. , I wont down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool , quiet , and subdued , it was mobbed with soldiers and it hummed with voices . The revolving door never stopped revolving , the seats were all taken , soldiers circled around the desk and the entrance to the cocktail lounge four deep . They came so fast , and they looked so much alike in their standardized clothes , that I grew panicky , and hurried back to my room . So many women were sitting in the lobby , twisting their handkerchiefs , with their eyes glued to the door , searching each face . Back safely in my room , I remembered what a girl had told inc . " It 's a shock when you first see your husband , " she had said . " In strange clothes , and talking somehow differently . And the worst thing is that they even look different . " I sat on the bed , staring at the door , half ready to laugh at myself , half ready to cry . Finally I went into the bathroom to comb my hair ? and at that moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life as a camp follower was under way . 4 IFourin the Travelers Aid office in Gladwyn , Missouri , sandwiched between a drugstore and a cleaning establishment , at the top of a flight of echoing wooden steps . I had already been room hunting for two hours that morning , ever since my bus from Itaska landed me in town . But I had found nothing but advice , freely given by friendly home-owners who had no vacancies . All of them had told me to go to the Travelers Aid ? the official USO housing agency . The office was mobbed with girls when I went in . The girl at the desk was talking to a small blonde with a husky , brown-eyed little girl at her side . " How was that place on Wood Street you looked at ? " she asked . " Same story , " the mother said . " She did n't want kids . Patty scares ' eat all , do n't you , baby ? " " I 'm an awful nuisance , " the little girl said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin for a soldier 's wife to have a child , " the mother said . " Well , it makes it tough , all right , " the worker agreed . " . I may have something this afternoon , thought , Mrs. Huston . Dim ) in then , will you ? " We all wanted the same thing , and we were all told that there might be some vacancies reported by afternoon . Each newcomer was urged to live in Itaska , and each felt , asi did , that it was too far from camp . I lit a cigarette , sat down , and lingered after 52 THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY the others had gone , hating to hit the pavements again . 1 introduced myself to the girl at the desk , who was calm and efficient and pleasant . Her name was Margaret Lewis . A soldier came in ? red in the face , and obviously in a hurry . " Can I leave a message here ? " he asked . " I imagine my girl will come by here sooner or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Margaret said . " What 's the mes-sage ? " " Just tell her to leave my hat here ? that I 'll be in to pick it up later . " " All right . What 's her last name ? " The soldier thought a moment . " Lydia , Lydia something . It begins with a P. Lydia Pinkham , " the soldier said . " That 's it ? Lydia Pinkbam . " Margaret looked up at him . " You 're sure ? " she asked . The soldier grinned . " No , " he said . " But it sounds familiar . Anyway , she 's got my hat . Tell her for God 's sake that it is n't funny , and I 've got to get that hat back . I 've been dodging Mrs all day . " Margaret wrote the message on a pad , with he " Lydia Pinkham " underlined . " Do n't forget my message now , " the soldier warned , and he rushed out , his GI shoes clattering on the wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message file . Just then the phone rang . Margaret wrote as she listened , and then said : " Yes , certainly I will , Mrs. Upton . Thanks so much for calling us . " " You might try this one , " she said . " I do n't know what it 's like , but it 's a vacancy , at least . She wo n't be home till four , so try after that . Let me know what happens , will you ? The woman has refused to rent the room to the last five girls I 've sent over . " She did n't explain further than that , and I took the slip eagerly . On the way out I passed a girl sitting on the stairs , holding one of her shoes in one hand and rubbing her foot with the other . " Lord , this town ! " she said crossly . " My feet 's killing me . " My feet were killing me , too , in another two hours . Margaret had told me that I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with a mental picture of setting up housekeeping in a cozy little one-room house , I trudged out to look at them . They were clustered on the main highway entering Gladwyn , interspersed with diners , groceries , the town 's bowling alley , and the Army Prophylactic station . The station was a clean , square little building , set back from the road , with a brightly painted sign reaching out to announce it . Over the door was a naked green light . Stop and go , I thought , all done in lights . Very neat . Two of the cabin courts had " No Vacancy " signs up , but the third ? advertising " 10 cabins , all strictly modern , 10 " ? had two vacancies , I found , on digging the manager out from under a bed where she was cleaning . Her name was Mrs. Tiede ( pronounced Tidy ) and she showed me around her establishment proudly , " Now this one here , " she said , " is one of my very nicest . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The cabin was charming at first glance , with three large windows and baby-blue walls . " And Venetian blinds , " she said , pulling them up and clown rapidly . " I just got them up . They aisle it pretty , do n't they ? They 're mighty hard to get nowadays . " The bathroom was as spotless as the cabin , and almost as lacking in essential equipment . The furniture in tine neat little room consisted of a bed , a straight chair holding an ashtray , and a small gas heater in one corner . There was no dresser . " The girls that 've lived in here have just made themselves right at home , " Mrs. Tiede said . " The last one brought a radio and a little bedside lamp , and it was real cute . " " Where did ' she put her clothes ? " I asked . " Now , I do n't really know , " Mrs. Tiede said cheerfully . " I guess she kept them in her suitcases . " " Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , as a matter of fact , we have n't got around to putting a closet in this cabin yet , " Mrs. Tiede said . " Most of the girls hang up their dresses on those hooks there . " She pointed to two sagging hooks on the wall . She stood in the middle of the room , and looked around with satisfaction . " It 's cute , is n't it ? " she said . I agreed that it was , and remembering tine swarm of girls in Margaret 's office , asking for rooms ? rooms of any kind  --  I asked tine price . " Well , " Mrs. Tiede said . " I used to charge sixteen a week for this one , but now with the Venetian blinds , I have to charge seventeen . " I multiplied quickly and found that tine rent amounted to considerably more than we had paid for a whole apart . ment in Washington . " Have you a cabin without the Venetian blinds ? " I asked . The next cabin ? which cost only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Mrs. Tiede obviously looked down on it . " Of course , this one has n't just been remodeled , " she said . It , too , was scrupulously clean , with orange and blue linoleum on the floor . I told her I wanted to look around a little more , but persuaded her to hold it for me until five , when I 'd call . Fifteen dollars appalled me , but it was cheaper than the hotel in Itaska , and Gladwyn was closer to camp . Talking about rents , I later asked Margaret if the OPA had n't ever noticed Gladwyn . " Sure , " she said . " They came in here and clamped clown ceilings kind of indiscriminately , and people took their rooms off the market . Frankly , we were relieved when they went away . The cabin courts ca n't be touched anyway because they simply multiply their daily rate by seven to get a weekly rate . " 5 IPA T I ENTLY covered whole streets of houses that afternoon , chatting with landladies and incumbent Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut with one exception the answer was always no . The exception was a temporary room . I could have it for a week , the lady told me , but the couple , who had gone on furlough , would want it back after that . The room was eight dollars a week . " I have a lot of girls here , " she said , leading me up the stairs . " When I first started renting , I put in a game room in the attic for them . This room is right off the game room . " It was , as a matter of fact , hardly off the game room . A partition that reached not quite to the top of my head cut off one corner of the large bare attic . " The girls use the game room during the clay , but it 's very private up here at , night. , " the landltuly assured n10 . " What about light ? " I asked , noticing none in Ille room . " Well , I let the couple keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " and that gives them Amy . " She explained the by-laws of the house . " The iathroom 's on the first floor , " she said . " I do n't at the girls use my kitchen ? it just makes too much ( ) illusion , you know ; and I do n't like any radios in he house . Also I do n't like smoking , but I do n't Oppose you smoke , do you ? " She did n't wait for n answer , and I laid the slightly tobacco-stained so fingers of my right hand , and decided it would o good for me to give up cigarettes for a while nytvity . I said I 'd call her back that afternoon . " Well , " she said as I left , " I hope for your sake lot you find something permanent , dear , but if A. you can stay here while you look around .

" You look as though you 're room hunting , " the driver said . I told hint I was . " Well , most all the girls in Gladwyn are , " he said . He was a good-looking young man , and I involuntarily wondered ? hating myself for the thought ? why he was n't in the Army . " I know of a nice room , " he said . " Right on the square . Want me to take you there ? I 'm going that way , anyway . I wo n't charge you . " Thinking how extraordinarily nice all Gladwynians were , I said hopefully : " Do you really know of a room ? " " Sure , " he said . " Just like I said . A nice one . " " Look , " I said , ready to grab at any chance . " Could you give inc the address , and I 'll go by there later . I want to finish up this street first . " " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you right there . " He sounded a little devious . " Which side of the square is it on ? " " Come on , hop in , " the man said . " It 'd only take a minute in the cab . " I refused , cursing myself for a suspicious fool when the young man shrugged his shoulders and drove away . But I was right , 1 discovered , when I talked to Margaret about it later , " Yes , " she said . " I 've heard of that stunt . Those places on the square are colorful spots . That 's where most of the syphilis that the camp authorities have a fit about starts . I guess some of the cab drivers are in cahoots with the houses . " I never saw a girl coming clown the steps of one of the houses on the square after that without wondering . By the time it was four , my feet and head ached , and I could feel a hole growing in the toe of my left stocking . As nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped in at the bus station , the only public place I knew , to clean up before going to the house that Margaret had told me about . I walked over there ? directed by my USO map of Gladwyn ? with my head held stiffly , trying to keep the wind from mussing my hair . A boy of high-school age answered the door , and I asked him if they had a room for rent . " Have we got a room for rent , Mom ? " he yelled back into the house . His mother called him , and when he came back , he asked : " Did the USO send you ? " I told him that they had , and he moved a bicycle which partially blocked the door , and invited me in . His mother , Mrs. Upton , was lying on a bed in the dining room in a housecoat and hair net , with cold cream on her face . " Excuse the way I look , " she said . " I just got back from work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair net , and her features were handsome and energetic , but beginning to be blurred by lines and excess flesh . She quizzed me about where I came from , how long I wanted the room , and what my husband 's schedule was . I felt more and more as though I were job hunting . Finally , I concluded I had passed the first inspection because she got up , walking as though her foot ached , and led me back into the room . " It is n't much , " she said . " But here it is . " The room , in the back of the house across from the kitchen , seemed almost too good to be true . It was light , with a real rug on the floor , a closet , dresser , double bed which sagged only slightly , a card table covered with a fresh cloth , and a private entrance , opening out onto a concrete porch on the side of the house . I told her I thought it was wonderful . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the girls always seem to like it . " We sat on the bed , with an ashtray between us , and talked it over . " The girls here take care of their own rooms , and we all share the bathroom , " she said . " It 's right next door to this room . You use linen as you want ; it 's in a cabinet in the bathroom . And it 's all live and let live . We 're just an ordinary family , an ordinary American family , and we do what we want and let other people do what they want , " A girl , younger than the boy , and strikingly pretty , appeared in the doorway . " Mother , is this dress all right to wear to the party ? " she asked , after looking me over . " You know it 's all right . Go on away , Patricia , " Mrs. Upton said . She pronounced it Patreecia . A small dog came into the room , sliding between the girl 's legs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I assured her I elid , and she disappeared . " You use your own entrance , " Mrs. Upton went on , " and go your own way , and we 'll get along fine . The kids make a lot of noise , but we 're just ordinary people , and Mr. Upton and I work very hard . " I found my mind jumping to follow her transitions , and noticed that her voice carried just the edge of a whine . Patricia appeared in the doorway again , just to look this time . " Go on about your business , Pat , " Mrs. Upton said . " You know you 're just showing off . " There was a hearty yell from the next room . " That 's Ralph , my son , " Mrs. Upton told me. " lie 's just showing off , too . " She asked me how long I had been in Gladwyn , and what I thought of it . I said I had n't seen miu except the square and a few residential streets . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All there is I see . That 's Gladwyn , the whole town . We area natives , of course , " she added emphatically , " w come from St. Louis .

I tell you I 'm afraid to let her go so in the streets at night . " I shook my head spivs thetically , wondering if all this meant that she wa going to take me . She got up and walked over to th doorway , and I followed , ready to admire anythin ; she pointed out . Clotheslines were laced across th porch , and concrete steps led into the obviousl : untended part of the yard . " Now , you sea those are your stops , " she said I looked obediently at the steps .

I 'd like to , because I know it 's hard for you girls , but I just do n't want to make any more bother for the girl who works for inc .
