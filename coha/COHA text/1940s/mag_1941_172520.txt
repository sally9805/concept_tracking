Stockholders and Wall Streeters found last week 's flood of first-quarter reports not all beer and skittles . True , combined profits of 345 top-flight companies ( as tabulated by New York 's National City Bank ) were $377,372,000 , up 17% above 1940 's first quarter , best since 1929 . But this bare statistic hid many ands , ifs , buts . <P> Biggest hidden item : taxes . As intended , they siphoned off profits almost as fast as business boosted them . Not all companies report tax reserves by quarters , but the first 90 to volunteer this breakdown earmarked $151,912,000 , four times the $41,392,000 tagged in 1940 's March quarter . In contrast to the $110,520,000 tax jump , profits of the same companies were up only $28,484,000 or less than 15% . The Government took 43% of pre-tax earnings ( 1940 figure : 19% ) <P> Other costs have mounted too . Wages reached an all-time high . The National Industrial Conference Board put hourly factory-worker pay in February at 76 , 4 above a year ago . The Bureau of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August 1939-100 ) stood last week at 138.1 , up 20% in twelve months . <P> Net result of this combination of rising taxes and costs has been an economic phenomenon : for the first time industrial production is going up faster than profits . In other periods of expanding business , profits have outrun production : in 1937 's March quarter , when production was 28% over the corresponding period of 1936 , profits rose 47% ; a 20% production rise in the final quarter of 1933 boosted earnings 900% ; even in 1929 's first quarter a 14% rise in production lifted profits 27% . <P> Taxes or not , many a corporation found lush diggings in the first quarter . Biggest industrial profit booster was the steel industry . Despite soaring taxes , first 28 steel reports showed combined profits of $82,638,000 , double March 1940 's $40,030,000 . Exception was Bethlehem whose earnings dropped from $10,891,000 to $10,436,000 while tax allowances rose from $2,855,000 to $7,200,000 . But U.S. Steel profits were up $19,446,000 to $36,560,000 ( best since 1929 ) even though taxes were up $16,031,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 10-an-hour wage boost there is slim chance steel profits can hold the pace . <P> Profits of the long downtrodden railroads ( TIME , April 7 ) rose even faster than steel earnings , almost trebled in the first quarter . Reasons : 1 ) carloadings were up 25% ; 2 ) the tax-weary carriers got their first tax break in years because all but a few will escape the excess-profits levy entirely . <P> &gt; Prime war babies of World War II are the aircraft makers . But first quarter profits of leading companies were erratic , went up , down , sideways . Although taxes jumped from $501,000 to $8,517,000 , United Aircraft doubled its profits , from $2,380,000 to $4,806,000 ( best ever ) . But Glenn L. Martin profits fell from $2,163,000 to $1,861,000 when its tax allowance rose almost sevenfold to $3,967,000 ; and Douglas Aircraft earnings remained virtually unchanged at $1,820,000.
