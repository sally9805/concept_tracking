Few laymen have ever heard of the golden hamster-but they are likely to hear of it from now on . Thousands of hamsters are being raised in U.S. , British and Canadian laboratories . The furry , golden-brown , short-tailed rodent is a serious rival to the guinea pig . <P> Laboratoiy workers consider the hamster 's laboratory qualifications practically ideal : it is even more susceptible to human diseases than the guinea pig . The gestation period is the shortest known for a mammal-15 days , 21 hours . It begins to mate by its 43rd day , bears its first litter at the age of two months . Thereafter , until the age of one year , when it stops bearing , it can deliver a litter of two to 15 young every month . <P> The first Syrian hamsters arrived in the U.S. in 1938 ; now one laboratory alone ( the University of Chicago 's Hull Biological Laboratories ) has a breeding colony of 1,500 . <P> The hamster is slightly smaller than a guinea pig and looks like a toy bear . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peanuts , dog chow , calf meal . It drinks no water , getting all the liquid it needs from leafy vegetables . At mealtimes , it stows all its food in huge pouches in its cheeks ; later it empties the pouches and chews at leisure . Its only defects as a laboratory animal : it likes to fight other hamsters , and a hamster , if disturbed during a delivery , may eat her young .
