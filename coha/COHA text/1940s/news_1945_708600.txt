txt In the first big controversy on world organization to arise in the international conference to abolish war , the British delegation today seized the initiative and stole the show from the Americans . While the American delegation still was keeping secret its plan for the disposition of the Japanese islands and other territories taken from the axis powers in this war , the British called a press conference and made public the British plan together with an explanation thereof and criticisms of the Amer . Man plan , which had been confiden ? tially submitted to them . Even after the press conference State Secretary Stettinlus continued to withhold the text of the Amer. lean plan , and the press was coin . pelted to rely on the British for information of its contents given in fragmentary form . Recall Previous Conference The incident was reminiscent of the Washington arms conference at which Lord Riddell took the ball away from State Secretary Hughes and became the chief source of information for the American public . Secretary Stettinlus and other members of the American delegation were conferring late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the British . Whether to make the American trusteeship plan public tomorrow or to continue to hold it back pending a meeting of the Big Four slated for tomorrow night was ' the question that caused them much brow wrinkling . Preceding this meeting there had been a dinner for 16 in the Stettinius penthouse atop the Fairmont hotel . British Foreign Secretary Eden , Russian Foreign Commisar Molotov , Chinese Foreign Minister Soong and Stettinius each brought three advisers . Chief subjects of discussion were the American and other amendments to the Dumbarton Oaks plan . Some Amendments Approved The Americans have 16 , amendments which they have prepared , and the total from all the nations represented at the conference runs Into something more that 700 pages . There were reports following tonight 's meeting that a score or more had been approved hut there wad no Indication which ones had proved acceptable to the Big Four . At the British press cdnference today Dominions Secretary Cran. borne held forth for an hour to more than 400 reporters on the pro . visions of . the British trusteeship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader of the house of lords and a viscount , explained that the American trusteeship plan would divide a territory into two categories . There would be a strategic area In which a military base might be established and in which the trustee power would be subject only In a limited degree to supervision by the security council of the proposed peace league . in the remaining area the trustee would be under the supervision of a trusteeship council responsible to the general assembly . " The Americans place the emphasis upon the strategic aspect while the British are more concerned with the welfare of depend . ent peoples and as Britain is an old colonial power perhaps that is only natural , " said Cranborne with a sly smile . He lost no opportunity to picture Britain as the all-wise , solicitous shepherd of the peoples dwelling in British colonies . " Will India be placed under a publicist . " No , " replied Cranborne , " India is not regarded as a backward nation . " Question for New League Palestine , said Cranborne , would continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations . Whether it should cease at some future time to be a territory mandated to the British or any ether power is a question for the ' proposed new league of nations to ' decide . The league also would decide when the people of a trusteed territory were no longer dependent but were ready for self-government . ' Asked if a territory could be transferred from one trustee to another the dominions secretary said : " No , not without the consent of the trustee . Of course a territory would not be given to a trustee ' power not able to administer it . " Cranborne then went at length Into his reasons for regarding the American plan as extremely lacking in practicality and in the solicitude for humanitarian considerations for which the British empire is renowned . Paramount Consultation " From our point of view , " he said , " the American plan is unsatisfactory on three grounds . First , for the United Kingdom government the interests of the indigenous inhabitants are a paramount consideration and in so far as the social and economic problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this supervision is just as necessary in strategic areas as in other areas . Indeed , it is probably in areas of strategic importance that the social problems such as housing , labor conditions , etc. , are likely to assume special significance . " Secondly , and particularly in large territories , it does not seem Possible to draw a hard and fast line separating strategic areas from nonstrategic areas . Consequently , if the security interests were to be properly safeguarded under the United States scheme of subdivision , it might often be necessary to designate the whole of a largr territory inhabited by dependent peoples as a strategic area , a course which , tho no doubt satisfactory from the purely military standpoint , would be open to criticism on wider grounds in that it would remove from the purview of the trusteeship council many of the matters for which the trusteeship system was primarily designed 25 years ago . Civil and Security Functions " Th 1 rdly , the United Kingdom draft , by avoiding any distinction between strategic and other areas , but differentiating between civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an ? nexation or infringement of the At . lantic Charter , but states in a more positive form than does the United States proposal that territories under the trusteeship system will be called upon to contribute from their resources towards international peace and security . At the same time the United Kingdom pro ? posal will not embarrass mandatory powers in the exercise of security functions in the territories concerned . " The American delegation 's trus ? teeship plan represents a compromise between the war and navy departments on the one hand and the state department on the other . The war and navy departments favored outright annexation of the Jap islands conquered by the United States  --  the Ryukyus , the Volcanoes , the Marshalls , Carolines , and Marianas . The navy deemed ownership of the islands essential to the establishment and control therein of the naval and air bases required for the defense of the United States in the Pacific . Objection Held Far-Fetched The state department held that annexation would be a violation of the Atlantic Charter renouncing territorial aggrandizement and favored a league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The navy regarded the territorial aggrandizement argument far fetched as these islands are merely pin points In the Pacific of no economic value . As a result of intervention by President Truman , however , the war and navy departments agreed to a compromise whereby the ' United States would be trustee of the islands , accountable to the league , but would have leasehold of areas required for bases and in these areas American control would be exclusive , The perennial sideline of negotiation at the conference is Poland . When not otherwise engaged Stet tinius , Molotov , and Eden ponder how to break the deadlock on the reorganization of the Lublin Polish government agreed upon by the Big Three at Yalta . A report that Stalin had agreed to invite Stanislaw Mikolajezyk , Polish peasant party leader to Moscow , to discuss the reorganization loosed a wave of optimism here regarding the prospects of settlement of this dispute in time to seat a Polish delegate in the San Francisco conference .                 @ @ @ @
