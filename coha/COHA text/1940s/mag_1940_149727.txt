Recent news of invention and engineering : <P> Going into the gloom of dark cinema houses , people are likely to stumble , bump into others . Ushers with flashlights are nuisances ; small lamps placed near the aisle floors illuminate only small areas . American Cyanamid Co. announced what it considers a better idea : aisle rugs treated with fluorescent dyes , bathed by invisible ultraviolet radiation from small tubes . Such rugs glow softly all over , interfere with nothing on the screen . General Electric 's House of Magic at the New York World 's Fair has a fluorescent aisle rug . <P> For years researchers of Chicago 's Swift &; Co. hunted for a chemical which would delay the spoiling of lard by oxidation and would protect lard 's linoleic constituent , rich in vitamin F. They finally found what they wanted in gum guaiac , made from the sap of the tropical American guaiacum tree . Swift 's President John Holmes said that lard treated with tiny amounts of gum guaiac was odorless , bland in flavor . <P> Plaster of Paris absorbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its electrical resistance . Dr. George John Bouyoucos of Michigan State College made use of this principle in a handy gadget which tells farmers the moisture content of their fields . Blocks of plaster of Paris the size of safety-match boxes are buried with wires leading to the surface . The wetter the soil , the lower the resistance of the buried blocks . Measurements can be taken by merely hooking the surface wires to a Wheatstone bridge , which measures the electrical resistance . By burying a number of plaster blocks at key locations , a farmer can go around at any time and get a moisture map of his land . <P> In neutral but palpitant Sweden , engineers of Ericsson Telephone Co. devised an air-raid alarm which works like a doorbell . The bell can be plugged into an ordinary current outlet in the house . If raiders come , the power plant slightly steps up the voltage in the line , rings the alarm bell in all houses which have one . <P> Rubber which conducts electricity sounds like an anomaly-but such a rubber would be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors . Reason : conducting rubber would continuously discharge static electricity , prevent it from accumulating to the point of spark peril . Static sparks in hospitals have been known to cause anesthetics to explode . In The Rubber Age , Engineer Howard E. Elden of Dunlop Tire &; Rubber Corp . <P> declared that his company has produced a successful conducting rubber . Whereas natural rubber has a resistance of 1,000,000,000,000,000 ohms per cubic centimetre , Dunlop 's conducting tire rubber records only 30 ohms per c.c. , its cable rubber only ten ohms . On how the rubber is made , Engineer Elden was mum . Dunlop Tire &; Rubber Corp . has taken out no patents , for patenting would make the details public , but has begun to market its conducting rubber .
