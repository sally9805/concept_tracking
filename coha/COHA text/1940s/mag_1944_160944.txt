Promptly he promised a government " composed largely of Greeks who have lived in their country under enemy occupation . " Promptly he persuaded liberal Sophocles Venizelos to take the premiership he had declined a week earlier ( TIME , April 17 ) . <P> Popular Premier Venizelos knew what most Greeks in the Middle East urgently wanted : an end to the old Tsouderos cabinet 's dilatoriness , a broadened government capable of administering liberated Greece until elections could be held . His crushing task was to find the right ministers for a " Panhellenic " government , men who would be acceptable to fighting Greeks in Greece , where the Leftist EAM dominates . <P> For the moment Sophocles Venizelos gave himself four main portfolios ( foreign affairs , war , navy , air ) , divided another six among three fellow ministers . At week 's end occupied Greece sent her first envoy to the new exile government : George Papandreou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Premier 's late father , the great Eleutherios Venizelos . Bitterly , passionately , the refugee spoke of Greek suffering under the Nazi heel , urged national unity : " From their graves our dead demand it . "
