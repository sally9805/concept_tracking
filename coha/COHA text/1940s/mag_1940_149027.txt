ARMY &; NAVY <P> Franklin Roosevelt said last week : " If the U. S. is to have any defense , it must have total defense . " The U. S. people agreed with both hands . And last week they wanted to know how much has been done about U. S. Defense , how much remained to be done . After a week of reports , official statements , military arithmetic , they were bound to conclude that the U. S. , materially and mentally , was still far from " total defense . " <P> Work Done seemed to add up to mighty small potatoes . Of $5,400,000,000 which Congress had voted for Defense since May , a piddling fraction had actually been spent . An enormous job of planning had to be done first . In charge of the planning were Industrialists William S. Knudsen , Edward Stettinius Jr. , some 200 high-powered colleagues on the President 's National Defense Advisory Commission . Getting these talented bigwigs down to coordinated work was in itself a big , time-taking job . Up to last fortnight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour 's chat with visitors ; many paced uneasily from office to office , fretting for something to do . But last week the doldrums were over . The commission was moving rapidly out of the planning stage into action . <P> The commission announced that Mr. Knudsen had painstakingly passed on $1,000,000,000 of equipment contracts . Aircraft Coordinator George Jackson Mead placed $100,000,000 of plane orders , got tape-wound Army &; Navy bureaus to simplify their contradictory , wasteful systems of testing and buying planes and engines . Commissioner Stettinius cheerily reviewed his studies of raw materials which the U. S. would need and might not have in wartime , said : " The situation . . . is more hopeful than we anticipated six weeks ago . . . . " For an example of heartening speed , he told of hearing about a stock of tungsten and antimony " near Indo-China . " The supply was bought , loaded on a U. S. ship , on the way to the U. S. within 48 hours . <P> For an example of disheartening delay , Mr. Stettinius wrathfully cited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. Government and Business . One of the commission 's prime concerns is aluminum , which aircraft makers will need in stupendous quantities . At the urgent behest of Messrs . Stettinius &; Knudsen , the House last week was asked to appropriate $25,000,000 for a new TVA dam , wherewith to supply the Aluminum Co. of America with critically needed power . Up popped Republican anti-TVA Congressman McLean of New Jersey , Republican Congressman Dirksen of Illinois , blocked the appropriation . They were unmoved by assurances that one of the bill 's sponsors was the commission 's Utilities Consultant Gano Dunn , whose engineering firm had once helped G. O. P. Candidate Wendell Willkie fight TVA . <P> Work Undone . Up to last week nobody had succeeded in charting the full scope of total U. S. Defense . But the President , with his third emergency estimate in two months , upped the prospective Defense bill for fiscal 1941 to $10,000,000,000-more than even he has needed in any previous year for the whole U. S. Government . Telling Congress what he proposed to do with the $4,848,171,957 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast objectives : <P> " 1 ) To . . . build up the Navy to meet any possible combination of hostile naval forces. *
