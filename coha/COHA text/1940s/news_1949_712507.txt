A vigorous and forthright // BISHOP MANNING , 83 , DIES IN RETIREMENT // churchman , Bishop Manning-leaves as his enduring monument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cathedral of St. John the Divine.li The actual building of the Ca thedral , largest church on the continent , began in 1892 , the year Bishop Manning became a priest . Years later , when he became head of the wealthiest Protestant Epis-1 copal Diocese in the United States , . / he was able to devote much of his , time and energy to overseeing the Cathedral 's stone-by-stone construction . The Cathedral grew in the passing years much in the same fashion as that of the great cathedrals of Chartres and Rheims , and the Bishop shepherded its rise with , the zeal and devotion of an early pilgrim . He lived to see the Cathedral 's vast interior progress to a point where its ultimate beauty ' and majesty could be envisioned . But Bishop Manning was not alone a builder . He was an outspoken , militant practitioner of his faith , frequently the center of controversy . He was essentially a " high church " Bishop and the " low church " members of his diocese occasionally dissented from his views in matters of ritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained a dogmatic theologian to the end . He opposed sensationalism in church matters and could , at times , be a coldly vehement foe of such-proposals as relaxation of the divorce laws or such fads as " companionate " and trial marriages . Called " Medieval Priest " S. J. Woolf , late writer-artist for THE NEW YORK TIMES , left ' the following impression of Bishop Manning on the occasion of the opening of a newly completed part of the cathedral in 1936 : " As he stood ? * * looking out toward the Gothic structure of the building , it was impossible not to feel a spiritual kinship between the medieval church and the trail , 1 ascetic churchman . For Bishop Manning in appearance is essentially the medieval priest . " To the artist , Dr. Manning 's manner was gracious , his voice full , round and mellifluous , and he appeared as genial , kindly and sympathetic . " But , " Mr. Woolf added , " his square-jawed , thin face , his dome-like forehead , his , piercing eyes , his peaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual nature which no amount of cordiality can conceal . " William Thomas Manning was born on May 12 , 1866 , in Northampton , England , a fact that almost kept him from the New York Bishopric when many of the members of the diocese thought that the Bishop should be American-born . He was brought to the United States by his parents when he Was a boy and lived in California for a time , lie was graduated from the University of the South , in Sewanee , Tenn. , and after  --  becoming a priest was made rector of a small church at Redwood , Calif . In 1896 Bishop Manning became rector of a church in Landsdowne , Tenn. , and in 1898 rector of Christ Church , Nashville , Term . a post he held for five years until he was called to New York to be vicar of St. Agnes ' Chapel of Trinity Parish . He became assistant rector of Trinity Church and upon the death in May , 1908 , of the Rev. Dr. Morgan Dix , Trinity rector , succeeded him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reduced Trinity Debt The position required consider-1 able business ability and during , ' Dr. Manning 's tenure the Trinity Corporation reduced its debt from $5,000,000 to $400,000 . Two newt , chapels and several other buildings were erected . In 1918 Bishop Manning served as an Army chaplain at Camp Upton , L. I. , and , upon the death later that year of David H. Greer , Proteetant Episcopal Bishop of New York , he was one of the three rectors considered to succeed Dr. , Greer . The Suffragan Bishop , 1 Charles Sumner Burch , was elected , however . When Bishop Burch died in December , 1920 , Dr. Manning was elected to succeed him in spite of opposition in certain quarters based on the fact that he was British-born . He was consecrated May 11 . The first year of his episcopate Bishop Manning had occasion to make known his views on divorce in a striking manner . He ruled that the Rev. Dr. Percy Stickney Grant , rector of the Church of the Ascension , could not wed Mrs. Rita de Acosta Lydig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lydig had been divorced . The marriage never took place . In the winter of 1922-23 Bishop Manning engaged in a controversy with Dr. Grant , whom he accused of utterances that the Bishop believed bordered on heresy . After a sermon in which Dr. Grant denied that Christ had the power of God , Bishop Manning asked him to disavow this view or resign . Dr. Grant did not resign and the matter was dropped after the Bishop decided that he ' did not have sufficient grounds to bring Dr. Grant before an ecclesiastical court . A few years later Bishop Manning attracted world-wide attention when ha attacked the Roman Catholic Church for annulling the marriage of the former Consuelo Vanderbilt and the Duke of Marlborough . After King Edward VIII of England abdicated in order to marry a divorced woman , Bishop Manning preached a sermon hailing the abdication as a victory for Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin and as " clear testimony by the British people in support of Christian marriage and Christian moral ideals . " Controversy With Guthrie One of the Bishop 's most famous controversies involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the church of St. Mark's-in-the-Bouwerie . Rituals permitted by Dr. Guthrie at the church included graceful dancing by bare-footed young women who were diaphanously although completely clad . Bishop Manning would have none of what he termed " dancing and paganism " in the famous old , church , and deprived Dr. Guthrie of his episcopal ministrations . The matter finally died down . A more serious matter involved plans by the New York City Board of Higher Education to appoint Bertrand Russell , British philosopher , to teach mathematics and logic at City College . Bishop Manning assailed Mr. Russell as a " defender of adultery and disbeliever in God . " He was the moving force in an interdenominational committee that forced the board to reconsider the appointment , but the board sustained its position by a vote of 11 to 7 . Thereupon a taxpayer 's suit was brought in Supreme Court and Justice John E. voided the appointment of Mr. Russell to the post . In 1930 , when Judge Ben B. Lindsey , who had attracted national attention by advocating " companionate marriage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manning in the Cathedral of St. John . the Divine , the Bishop had him ejected from the premises . Later , Judge Lindsey was charged with creating a disturbance , but , after several court adjournments , the case was dropped . A number of theological disagreements characterized , Bishop Manning 's term as Bishop of New York . In 1934 , in an address before the general convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church at Atlantic City , he declared that the Episcopal Church was " fundamentally and definitely catholic in its faith " and that its heritage of the Apostolic succession prevented it from complete union with any other Protestant churches unless they accepted this succession . Anglican " high church " adherents praised his view in this matter , but he was severely criticized by the " low church " groups . This controversy was revived in February , 1943 , when Bishop Manning publicly rebuked the Archbishop of Canterbury on the grounds that the Primate of England had taken sides in the discussion by praising the work of a group that was supporting union of the Episcopal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tenets Although Bishop Manning was a strong conservative , he did not consider himself a fundamentalist . He accepted evolution and other scientific tenets of belief , holding that ? they did not conflict with Christianity . Nor was he in the forefront of the fight for national prohibition in the Twenties : He sanctioned the moderate use of wines and liquors and did not oppose Sunday recreation when it did not interfere with worship . The outbreak of the second World War diverted Bishop Manning 's attention from carrying forward the construction of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine . His views advanced rapidly from a plea for " all rightful aid " to the French and British in October , 1939 , to " utmost aid " in May , 1940 . Later he urged help " without stint or limit " and in May , 1941 , he said : " We should now take our full and open part in this conflict , " In 1939 he denounced Soviet Russia as an accomplice of Germany , but in October , 1941 , he asked aid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " COIP science and common sense dictpte this course , " he'wrote . He.pre , yed for peace , but he announced , that there should be " no peace until it can be made a righteous , peace . " He denounced strikes in defense industries and called fora We:ay awakening in America . He said : " We have no right for help from God unless we are using to the full the powers and capacities that God has given us . " Bishop Manning supported many of President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's social and economic reforms during the first Roosevelt administration . He backed the President in seeking Federal laws to curb child labor and for unemployment insurance . His enthusiasm for Mr. Roosevelt 's program cooled with each succeeding administration and he came out strongly against the President in 1937 in the matter of the President 's plans to increase the size of the Supreme Court of the United States . Bishop Manning constantly voiced warnings ' against proposals which he believed would strengthen " personal government " and called for the free play of democratic institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John the Divine , however , that engaged much of the attention of the small and frailappearing churchman . Into this work he flung himself with an ardor that many found amazing . Host to Other Clergymen Bishop Manning hoped that the cathedral would be a place of worship for all the people and upon occasion he opened the pulpit of the cathedral to clergymen of other denominations . When he introduced a " Sports Bay " in the construction of the cathedral , he was criticized in some secular quarters . This bay is dedicated to the athletes of the world . In 1950 Bishop Manning accepted two tall Menorah lights , the seven-branched symbols of Judaism , from the late Adolph S. Ochs , publisher of TEE NEW YORK TIMES , for places beside the high altar . During the long course of fund-raising for the cathedral , contributions were received from Jews , Protestants of other denominations and from Roman Catholics , During the five years that preceded the financial crash of October , 1929 , 500,000 people had con tributed more than $12,000,000 to the building of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtaining contributions for the vast project . His gently insistent manner wore down more than one wealthy American , although at times , national recessions and wars  --  together with the sharp rise in building costs in recent years  --  impeded the Bishop 's efforts to carry the building pro-1 gram forward . After the Episcopal Convention of 1943 had ruled that a Bishop must retire at the age of 72 , there was speculation as to Bishop Manning 's retirement . Bishop Manning took the position that the ruling of the convention could not become retroactive and promised his followers that : " I shall continue to serve you as your Bishop as long as I am given health and sufficient strength . " Retired at End of 1946 He retired on Dec. 31 , 1946 , and the House of Bishops expressed " profound regret " over his retirement . Charles Kendall Gilbert , Suffragan Bishop , was elected to succeed him . Dr. Manning then moved from the sixty-room Bishop 's house on the cathedral grounds to Bishop Gilbert 's sixroom house at 6 Washington Mews . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and public affairs ton limited extent . He sought to aid a group of Greenwich Village artists who were trying to raise adequate funds to purchase a site for an art center on the south side of Washington Square . On the eve of big eighty-second birthday in 1948 , Dr. Manning declared that he favored universal military training and condemned what he termed " sentimental pacifism " as inviting rather than preventing wars . In February , 1949 , he joined the long list of clergymen and laymen who condemned the conviction of Joseph Cardinal Mindszenty.
