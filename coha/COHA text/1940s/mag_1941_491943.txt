GREAT BRITAIN maintains two ambassadors in the United States , one appointed by the Foreign Office , the other named by The London Times . Lord Lothian , Viscount Halifax ? the Foreign Office envoys come and go , and many Americans do not know their names . But Sir Willmott Lewis , the emissary of The Times , stays . His detractors claim that Sir Willmott is a propagandist beside whom Goebbels is a lout with a toy horn . His admirers maintain that he is an interpreter of events the price of whose wisdom is above rubies . They are practically unanimous in conceding that he has done more to improve relations between England and the United States than any other person , with the possible exception of Adolf Hitler . This despite the fact that Sir Willmott always insists that " the best thing to do for AngloAmerican relations is to leave them strictly alone . " His influence does not derive from any compelling will to power . On the contrary , Lewis is an indolent man , a playboy and an actor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1912 , written to conform to the most romantic American imagination . He out-Hamlets Hamlet . No such English gentleman was ever seen in Mayfair or moorland . When he walks into a drawing room  --  or a barroom  --  you have an impression of bands playing Rifle , Britannia I He is so British that his baffled countrymen say , " But he 's American . " That is true too . He has lived in this country so long , studied it so assiduously , that he has become American-plated . This combination has proved irresistible . The foreigner who genuinely understands us is rare . Sir Willmott knows us so well that he won the National Press Club pool predicting the size of Roosevelt 's 1936 majority . Therefore , people , whether they be Cabinet secretaries , newspaper correspondents or Sioux City clubwomen , listen . He is a male Cornelia Otis Skinner who composes his acts and then presents them alone . He talks steadily , always . Meet him on Pennsylvania Avenue , he will stop and address you as if you were an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lemon in his tea , he will answer with a thirty-fiveminute discourse on their relative merits . He may , perhaps , permit you to talk long enough to prevent his conversation from becoming a monologue , never long enough to permit its becoming a dialogue . He has even silenced Dorothy Thompson , whom he characterizes as " the woman who has discovered the secret of perpetual emotion . " Ji Knight 's Credo T HOUGH he is a British knight from the top of his well-brushed head to his well-brushed boots , his credo springs frankly from the factthat he is " of little streets and little people . " The astonished David Sarnoff , hearing Lewis champion the cause of the underdog one night , exclaimed , " I thought you played with the rich boys . T never knew you were one of us . " The surprise was mutual . His act is a brilliant one , for he combines authentic scholarliness with an incredible memory . Though he may wear the red ribbon of the French Legion of Honor in his buttonhole , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each side of himself . " It is too much to expect that the universal franchise and inequitable distribution of wealth will lie peacefully together for long , " he will rumble in his rich resonant bass voice . Then he will raise his thin eyebrows to Gothic arches , his eyes will gleam , he will slowly wave a long forefinger . " Do you know who said that ? " While you are sorting out Berle or Tug  --  ell or Jerome Frank , he will confound you : " Daniel Webster  --  in 1830 . " An Apostle of Empire Y OU must see as well as hear Willmott Lewis or you lose half the effect . For six months he was on the air , on a coffee program . He was not a success , though his periods were , as always , polished . Even when be has said nothing whatever at very great length , as he often does , you leave him feeling that you have been pausing in an intellectual Sistine Chapel . His epigrams and puns drop as diamonds , master-cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a mistake in his name ; it should be " Bonmott . " Though you may have gleaned no ideas from him , you always go away with something to quote . People often appropriate his verbal gems . One out of every five visiting celebrities has used Sir Willmott 's " I feel like a lion in a den of Daniels . " New Dealers are still quoting his " Who killed the goose that laid the golden age ? " Naturally , he is not merely good entertainment . He is always the advocate of the British Empire . He is a sort of connective tissue between England and the United States , explaining one to the other . For instance : The British embassy went indifferently away on its vacation while the 1927 conference on limitation of armaments ground on . Lewis stayed sweltering in Washington , cabling warnings to the British of the temper of American public opinion , which was hotly resentful of the British demands . Again at the London Naval Conference of 1930 he made it clear to the British that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope , and parity . " When the British repudiated the war debt , Lewis explained and explained , over his own dinner table , at the homes of his friends  --  especially such as the late Senator Borah  --  at Mrs. Borden Harriman 's Sundaynight ( Continued an Pap 47 ) suppers  --  anywhere two or three senators or congressmen were gathered together . He has diagramed the British viewpoint to the isolationists , saying You can not print a positive image of peace on an American negative . " He has never ceased demonstrating why the Neutrality Act is a handcuff to harassed Britain . Too shrewd , of course , to meddle publicly in domestic American polities , he prayed for the New Deal , even if he could not vote for it . In Washington , which knew his sentiments so well , there was no need of hiding them . He was en original New Dealer ; first , because he is more radical than the New Deal ; second , because he is , of necessity , an internationalist . And Mr. Roosevelt 's determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " naturally has compounded that partisanship . Lust November sixth , Sir Willmott recovered miraculously from a depression he said had been caused by a cold . He does not confine himself to great issues ; he knows the importance of small ones . There was the matter of Margaret McReynolds . The American embassy in London had arranged that she be presented at cJurt in 1933 . Her photograph in her gown , complete with plumes , had appeared in the hometown papers ; she had learned the proper genuflections and etiquette . Then her father , Congressman Sam McReynolds , was appointed a delegate to the Economic Conference , to be held in London coincidently . As there were hundreds of delegates , all with wives and daughters , the Lord Chamberlain ruled , in the interest of harmony , that none should be presented . Imagine the misery of Miss McReynolds , already pictured in the papers . Imagine the outrage of her father . Officials at our embassy went to the then Prince of Wales , who pleaded the case to no avail . Willmott Lewis heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belle ; taxied down to his office , and returned to Bill Bullitt 's room at Claridge 's half an hour later with the assurance that Miss McReynolds would be received by Their Majesties . During the Spanish civil war , the Duchess of Athol ' , a lady ablaze with her convictions , came to the United States . Wise Washingtonians noted happily that Willmott Lewis was usually in her train , tweaking her into discretion whenever Spain entered the conversation . Several years ago a munitions investigation on Capitol Hill threatened a scandal concerning the allegation that ( Continued on Page SO ) 31 ? 111 ? 11111111.11* ( Continued from Page 47 ) the King of England was interested in arms contracts . Lewis explained the position of the sovereign and convinced legislators that it could not be . During the Hoover Administration , when prohibition was a fighting word , Sir Esme Howard , then British ambaeoldor , went on record that he thought the law was a fine idea . To hose out the sulphurous response , Sir Willmott counseled Sir Esme 's pacifying promise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not buy another drop . " Which exasperated the other embassies and legations , those founts of fine vintages in an era of bathtub gin . Of the four ambassadors of Great Britain here during Lewis ' twenty years in Washington , only Sir Ronald Lindsay refused to avail himself of Lewis ' knowledge of American idiosyncrasies . Sir Ronald , a stiff-necked diplomat of the Kitchener type , disliked the press , and , although he saw him often , Sir Willmott as part of it . The clunking of the gates of the big redbrick bit of England on Massachusetts Avenue merely made Lewis more important . He became the only point of contact between the Washington correspondents and the embassy . In his latter years here , when anyone asked Sir Ronald a question , he would respond sourly , " Have n't you seen Willmott Lewis ? " Washington laughed , " I told you so ! " when the garden party for the King and Queen , organized without benefit of Lewis , made the embassy a host of enthusiastic enemies . Even today , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you wish to get anything promptly , whether it be a statement from Churchill or a decision on a visa , you do not err if you go to Willmott Lewis . When he went to register as an alien , in accordance with the law , he was asked his nickname . " 1 guess everyone calls me Bill , " he responded . They always have , in all the odd places in the world . For the journalistdiplomat you see today talking suavely with Senator Taft over a glass of champagne in Alice Longworth 's drawing room , kibitzing contentedly in the card room of the Press Club or holding forth to a group of entranced hardware manufacturers at the Mayflower Hotel , is the product of the sort of life that makes small boys dream of being foreign correspondents . The School of the World The American-plating process began in Bill 's childhood . He was born in Wales , in 1877 , " which makes me very , very old , " he insists . Bill has always relished old age and decrepitude with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Orient , veteran war correspondents whom he fathered in Paris during the last World War , meet him now and are startled into " He was old then  --  and no older than he is today ! " His grandfather , patriarch , justice of the peace , and twice mayor of Cardiff , used to take him for walks when he was small . He would talk to the child of the America he had never seen with a mystical and a passionate belief , according to the grandson . " There , my boy , " he would say , waving a hand in the presumable direction of the United States , " there , my darling child , lies the hope of the world . " After preliminary schooling in England , Bill went to Heidelberg , where he was exposed to German Kultur , German beer and German Licder , becom ing proficient in each . Then to France , to the Sorbonne , where he became a young Frenchman and majored in French letters and French cafes . With the facility of a chameleon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it as his admirers would , he outgrew provincialism into the realization that all peoples are essentially the same people . When he finished his schooling , he had acquired a great deal of pure learning , an elastic intellect , a good singing voice and an almost native command of German and French in their more elegant forms . These talents found employment at twenty-five shillings a week on a Brighton paper , writing funeral and wedding notices . Having served this apprenticeship and taught himself , on the side , shorthand out of a book , winning a certificate for taking 220 words of dictation a minute , he set out to conquer Fleet Street . In his Massachusetts Avenue home , with its shining silver and smiling servants , he can grow wistful now about trying to keep alive in dingy London lodgings forever smelling of Brussels sprouts on no more income than an occasional five shillings from a poem . In any case , he did n't come up the easy way . Unable to get a job on a London newspaper , he was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily have been another Ronald Colman in Hollywood now , or a Maurice Evans playing Malvolio to Helen Hayes ' Viola , as what he is . The same latent talent was there , but the cards did not fall that way . The company manager chucked it , leaving the troupe stranded in a South-of-England town . Lewis got hack to London , and there that shorthand schooling got him his first real job , but it was half the world away in Shanghai . The North China Star had advertised for an " assistant editor and shorthand reporter . " The job was more shorthand than editing , but it served . On the China coast , Bill Lewis is a legend . A dashing young blade , everything he did was spectacular . Even his debts , in that land of easy credit . As a gentleman jockey , owning a stable of fast little Mongolian ponies , the racing stock of the East , he was the despair of his groom . At five in the morning the groom would appear at his door , hear " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill 's boots and breeches , to whatever party was still continuing . Bill 's life in the Orient was as full of ups and downs as a seismograph during an earthquake . One time he would be the darling of the local socialites ; another he would be playing the piano in a honky-tonk off the Nanking Road . " Nations get drunk and disorderly , just like people , " he will begin , if you ask him what tie thinks of the present war . His consequent philosophical dissertation will be absorbing , because Sir Willmott has done his research work in was as well . After he had been in Shanghai a couple of years , Bill went to Japan , to Nagasaki , where he married , edited a small daily paper , and learned to speak Japanese with great fluency and little accuracy . In 1903 , when he scented the Russian war on the wind , he journeyed to Korea , recommending himself highly to James Gordon Bennett , publisher of the New York Herald , and securing an assignment . On the covert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bill dug in at Chemulpho . In those days , Korea was a land almost un known . Life there was much like that in the time of Abraham . There were few foreigners , mostly young men . Jack London got there in a rowboat . The Pooh-Bah of the country was William Franklin Sands , a twenty-nineyear-old American who was " adviser to the emperor . " Bill thought he was the most romantic man in the world . Bill cheered up this colony of lonely youths . Then , as now , he was a superb raconteur , and when anyone pinned him down , he would quote Bennett 's " Remember , young man , many a good story has been ruined by oververification . " Handsome , lighthearted , ready to sing , to play poker , to experiment with his talent for " keeping his head above alcohol , " of course he was popular . People told him things . He began to learn discretion . None of the English or Americans ever knew he spoke any other than his native language . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese , and readily picked up the Korean tongue . - Trailing a War Thus he heard at once of the ultimatum issued by the Japanese Admiral Uriu to the two Russian ships at anchor in the harbor ; learned also of the protests to be sent by the captains of the British and French warships also there . The only newspaperman with the story , Bill hired a launch , followed the boat bearing the protest to Admiral Uriu , saw the Russian ships stripping for action , heard the cheering , and spent some pretty terrified minutes before he got out of the line of fire . He wrote his dispatch to the sound of the exploding vessels , and was on his way north with General Kuroki . Then , as now , war news was censored . Bill therefore developed a system of runners who relayed his copy to Seoul , where it was filed on a free wire . When news of his reports filtered back to Japan , the Japanese hunted him up . Bill was banished to Tokyo , where a group of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr. , and Martin Egan were drawing their pay and cooling their heels . At last this group was taken of to Dairen , where they were tantalized by hearing the guns of Port Arthur and finally were allowed to land and to catch up with the war . For once , money had accumulated . Bill decided , therefore , it was high time to go to inspect the " hope of the world . " In 1905 he saw the Golden Gate . The amiable people who showed him New York would have been incredulous had they been told that this eager but profligate young Englishman was one day to succeed General Pershing as president of the Philippine Club ; was to become the friend of Elihu Root , of Chief Justice Hughes and Justice Holmes ; would receive an honorary degree from Trinity College ; that Secretary of State Hull was to talk with him with complete candor . For life in the United States then followed his established pattern . He spent hours listening to his idol , Arthur Twining Hadley , president of Yale ; operated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsisted only through the generosity of his friends . Finally he drifted back to the Orient , first to Japan , then to the Philippines , where he found that his friend Martin Egan was publishing the Manila Times . Presently , Bill was its editor . In Manila , with its Spanish and American colonies set in the midst of eight ( Gantinued an Page 12 ) ( Continued from Page 50 ) million Filipinos , " the limey " became the voice of militant Americanism . He wrote the editorials , a column , moat of the news . He and Edward Bruce , his boss , would sit over cocktails with the editor of the opposition journal , cook up fights , vituperate each other in print . Unable to afford the A. P. , Bill watched his competitor 's cable stories , figured out their probable sequels , printed his guesses as news . He was right often enough to astound his colleagues . When the first World War broke out , he offered his services to England , was told he was more valuable editing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trench . Once , in Manila , during a discussion of the war , someone asked him what he thought of these blank-blank English . " I ca n't say . I am one of them . " " You are ! " Astonishment was unbounded . " We always thought you were a Harvard man putting on dog . " When the United States entered the war , Bill appeared in Paris and met James Kerney in some cafe . Kerney , editor of the Trenton , New Jersey , Times , was head of the Paris headquarters of George Creel 's Committee on Public Information , at President Wilson 's personal insistence . Kerney knew no French , which infuriated him . " What 's that man saying ? " he 'd storm . " Stupid creatures ! Ca n't even speak English . " He was charmed with Lewis , no less by his personality than by his ability to speak French . Kerney applied to Pershing , to George Creel in Washington , and got Lewis appointed as the No. 2 man on his staff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propaganda in Europe . Shortly before the Armistice Kerney went home , leaving the entire job in the Englishman 's hands . For this work Lewis was decorated with the Legion of Honor . Lewis wheedled Cardinal Mercier into the endorsement of a booklet praising American activities , persuaded Marshal Jere to correct an impression made by American Army officers . A party of Dutch editors , taken on a tour of the American front by Henry Suydam , were less than amused by the tale of the virtues of the A. E.F . as sung by its officers . Gilding a Queen Distressed , Suydam and Bill decided the best way to remedy this unfortunate impression was to persuade a Frenchman to tell it again . He selected Joffre , discussed it with him , and then led the party in to the marshal , seated in all his medals , in his office in a great gilded room in Lea Invalides . " I have the most happy remembrances of your queen , " said Joffre , eying Bill anxiously . " Such charm ! Such beauty ! Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilhelmina , famed as a paragon of domestic virtue , as intelligent and steadfast , but scarcely chic . Enchanted , they then went off parroting Joffre 's panegyric on the American forces in France . Lord Northcliffe , in Paris , then , admired Lewis ' adroitness as well as his penetration of American psychology and grasp of American techniques . So , once the captains and the kings departed , after Bill had spent another , and final , period of indigence with only a tentative connection with the Paris Herald , Northcliffe sent for him , offered him the post of Washington correspondent of The Times , replacing Sir Arthur Willert , who was about to leave The Times , That was in 1920 . Since his early years in Washington , when he lived with Harold Sims , attache of the Brit-iah embassy , and rushed from dinner to dance with the then Wallis Warfield , Felipe Espil , now the ambassador of Argentina , Juan de Cfirdenas , now the Spanish ambassador , and others of the smart set of the brassy 20 's  --  sine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says , " I have exhausted time in Washington . I am impinging upon eternity . " The hen vivant who once described , with the love of a sculptor at work , how you take a small melon , slice a piece off the top , empty it of seeds and fill it with strawberries and Grand Marnier , let it stand for twenty-four hours , then throw out the strawberries and serve the melon , has passed . In his place is a gentleman of unreliable digestion who drinks sparingly , and consoles his calory-counting friends with " Eating is a very minor pleasure . " Armchair Reporter The days when he slept in a satin bed in a satin room are gone . While he was married to Ethel Noyes , daughter of Frank Noyes , president of the Washington Star , and long president of the Associated Press  --  whom , it is said , he characterized as a perfect example of what is wrong with American business ? he was a fashionable figure . Now that he is married to the former Mrs. Norma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , with his big hoxer and his library of 7000 books . The only thing wrong with this picture is that he will net like country life ? and his wife likes duck shooting . As a correspondent for The Times , Bill was a prodigious success , both from the viewpoint of its readers and that of No. 10 Downing Street . Though his copy is usually late , though he never writes as well as he talks , his pontifical style of heavy " think pieces , " sometimes meager in news , always rich in meditation , is entirely comprehensible to and appreciated by his audience . If it is true that a reporter is as good as his legs , Bill is not what he used to be , for he rarely goes to news sources , never to press conferences , never to the State Department  --  over whose portals , he once said , there should be graven , " Out ! damned spat ! " He did not go in 1940 to the presidential conventions . " I know all about them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defined as abracadabra , or ten thousand words to that effect . Moreover , constant attendance at party conventions is a homeopathic cure for democracy . " However , he manages to be one of the best-informed men in Washington . He calls on the telephone : sees officials at dinner , reads prodigiously  --  especially American history , past and contemporary ? alwaya with a scratch-pad beside him , and talks to newspapermen . For this purpose he comes up to the National Press Club every day , sees the best of the Washington correspondents  --  who have a theory that he absorbs what they know through his pores , for he never stops talking . In fact , he has a habit of telling you what you know . He 's told Senator Barkley about conditions in Kentucky , paint manufacturers the problems of their business . Once when he 'd bested Herbert Bayard Swope in an argument about facts , Swope phrased a common irritation . " Plausible fellow , " he said , never witty at the ex-or enemy . When he p " **35;1723;TOOLONG " described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the word , " and another as " Savonarola and soda , " he was satirizing ideas , not personalities . He will go to endless trouble for his friends . When Edward Bruce suffered a paralytic stroke and went to a lonely Vermont village to recover , Bill wrote him long , sparkling letters every day of the long weeks of Bruce 's convalescence . When he came back to town , Bill apparently forgot he existed . He 'll do that too . He rarely loses a friend , whatever his many sins of omission . When word came to the British embassy that Bill was to be made a knight commander of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year 's Honors List of 1931 , the ambassador himself phoned the news , located Lewis at the Press Club playing cards . " Oh , my God , " was Bill 's only comment as he went placidly back to his rummy . The celebration organized by his colleagues and attended by 250 men and women of every condition was not casual , and signified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Mayflower Hotel bore the legend " Decorations . " Guests arrived wearing candy-box ribbons , old convention badges and buttons of the Taft and Wilson campaigns . They found five glasses at each plate , though Prohibition still existed , got hilariously tight on five different wines , which , they afterward learned , contained not one tenth of one per cent of alcohol amongst them . They laughed at skits presented in the Gridiron Club manner  --  a stereopticon lecture showing the ruin of Bill 's house after one of his parties , a fake broadcast by Ramsay MacDonald over B. B. C. , and so on . ' All politicians are the same politician . ' " The audience plane to remember that one . He assumes a depth of knowledge and breadth of reason which they do not have at all . This flatters them . Never does he start , like so many speakers , with veteran minstrel-show jokes , and then say , " Now , to be serious ? " With more sophisticated gatherings he is not always so successful . For instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling , it is said , that he tends to defend the indefensible . But he patronizes the American businessman so adroitly that he is in constant demand by them as a speaker , formal or informal ; this despite his being rather to t heleft of the New Deal . Interpreting America His House of Lords presence , his knighthood and his melodious sentences tend to conceal his heresies . When Prentiss Coonley , of the Business Advisory Council of the Department of Commerce , was charged with seeing what could be done to compose the mutual recriminations of Government and business , Sir Willmott was one of the first persons he wig-wagged . Stettinius and Knudsen have asked him to talk with men s  --  sociated with the Advisory Commission to the Council for National Defense . Bill is crafty in his approach . He would blush to be so obvious as to defend the New Deal frontally . No , he keeps severely away from current events , retiring into past American history , from which he dredges out scholarly references , integrating the past with the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to begin solemnly , " who has the power to adjust his environment to himself . " Then he will go on to remind his listeners that , after the Revolution , the men who framed the Constitution realized that if the vast territory to the westward was not settled by Americans , it would be settled by the people they had just fought . To settle it would take both men and money . Wherefore the individual man and his money were granted a legal recognition never known in the world before . Then Sir Willmott proceeds to show that the businessman thought he was the country and tried to take over the Government , looked upon his unique legal privileges as rights . Ile will put his chin into his collar , his voice in his toes , and continue , " To have a continuing democracy , there are two things the individual must have : The first is a home , his physical stake in his government ; the second is a continuing job , which is his security . While there was the turmoil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chance for success . With the growth of big business and the concentration of wealth , that general opportunity has diminished . The thing the average man has is his vote , and that he resorts to in behalf of the man make ing the battle for him . " If the atmosphere is favorable , he may go on to propound his theory that labor 's power will become not economic , but political , as it is in England . He used to argue this point with Samuel Gamper% who had an exactly opposed goal . Regardless of whether you quite understand or like his principles or objectives , you enjoy them . An English gentleman in manner who speaks the American language , he makes you feel you are surpassing in intelligence and perception . What more can you ask ?
