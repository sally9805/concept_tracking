Under a sunny afternoon sky the sleek grey ship moved slowly down New York Bay . She had 464 silent passengers on board . For them there would be no more cocktails in glittering bars with wide-eyed caf socialites , no lavish dinners for affable U.S. businessmen . They were Nazi and Fascist propaganda agents , consular officers and their families , bound homeward to the grim realities of the New Order . <P> There was many an awkward delay before the U.S.S. West Point finally got away . In San Francisco , 2,570 miles away , debonair Consul General Captain Fritz Wiedemann and Dr. Johannes Borchers , German consul general in New York City , with an entourage of 14 people , had had to cancel their passage on a Japanese liner sailing two days before the President 's deadline expired on July 15 . The British safe conduct to Japan had arrived too late . Captain Wiedemann talked to Washington and Berlin . Then he chartered three planes , stowed his party and their luggage aboard , and sped eastward . Said the Captain as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baggage men : " Well have to win the war to pay for this trip . " In Washington , Charg d'Affaires Dr. Hans Thomsen scraped the Embassy bare of cash to pay the Captain 's airline bill ( $14,486 ) . <P> Meanwhile , in Manhattan , glum Germans and sad-eyed Italians were going aboard the West Point . From Ellis Island , where he was taken two months ago for violating U.S. immigration laws , onetime German Minister to Austria Dr. Kurt Rieth was set free . Freed also were Dr. Manfred Zapp and Gnther Tonn , U.S. managers of the Nazi Transocean News Service ( now closed ) , who had failed to register with the State Department as foreign agents . The newsmen were to be exchanged for two U.S. newsmen , Jay Allen of North American Newspaper Alliance , Richard Hottelet of United Press , " detained " by the Nazis since March . <P> Angelo V. Jannelli was close to tears as he joined the long line plodding up the gangplank . He had been Italy 's consular agent at Johnstown , Pa. since 1932 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Said Agent Jannelli : " I 've thought of the United States as my home . " In Fort Worth , Tex. , 72-year-old Consular Agent Atillio Ortolani won permission from the State Department to stay in the U.S. Married to a British wife , with two sons in the U.S. armed forces , Agent Ortolani said he would rather go to a concentration camp than back to Italy . <P> At midnight the West Point was ready for sea . But still it did not sail . She was held up , rumor said , because 234 U.S. consular officials in Europe , on their way to Lisbon from posts in Axis territory , had been halted near the German and Italian borders , were to be kept in Frankfurt am Main and San Remo until the West Point delivered her passengers in Lisbon. * At 3:15 o'clock next afternoon , she sailed at last . <P> The West Point carried more armament than any transport ever seen in New York Harbor : at least four guns , including two 5-in. naval guns , anti-aircraft batteries , machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against magnetic mines . In command of her crew of 750 U.S. sailors , 60 Marines , was Captain Frank H. Kelley , U.S.N.
