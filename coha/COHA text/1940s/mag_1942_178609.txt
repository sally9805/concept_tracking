You , Too , May Be A Guerrilla <P> Anyone who thinks his country might be invaded-which means anyone now alive-would do well to read " Yank " Levy 's Guerrilla Warfare-for instructions on how to harass invaders . Author Levy , 44 , a Canadian-born soldier of fortune , now instructor of British Home Guards , has compiled a civilian 's manual of mayhem and informal murder . His book is a brief , businesslike discussion of contemporary strategy , tactics and tricks for people caught in an invasion , with dozens of helpful hints on hamstringing , backstabbing , sniping and other dust-biting dodges . Author Levy urges householders to organize right away , study the neighborhood topography , spend pre-invasion days learning how to be " a sinister shadow . " <P> Sinister Shadow . The guerrilla should wear clothes of neutral color , should festoon himself with twigs , barks , leaves for camouflage . He may signal his colleagues with bird whistles , remembering always to use the calls of birds in season . He never raises his face to airplanes , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Methods of ambush are important . A wire cable strung across a road at an angle will slide a motorcycle off into the ditch , where the cyclist can be slugged and searched . " Messages may be glued to the soles of the feet . Comb the hair ; look between the toes . " All kinds of decoys may be used to stop cyclists and staff cars or to make them swerve and crash : a couple of baby carriages covered with sacking , a pair of old auto headlamps , operated on batteries , set in the middle of the road . " To attract the closest attention of enemy car drivers or guards , prop up a dead Nazi where they will see him . " <P> Destruction is one aim . A guerrilla learns how to derail and wreck trains , blow up tanks , destroy planes on the ground , dynamite bridges . He steals at night into the middle of an enemy motor lorry park , removes sparkplugs , drops an iron bolt into the engine , puts the plug back and steals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ruined when someone tries to start it in the morning . Or he drops sugar lumps or pours linseed oil into a gas tank , which will immobilize a car by the time it has run four miles . <P> In taking sentries , advises Mr. Levy , the back is the best approach . If that is not possible , the guerrilla covers the sentry with his revolver , steps on his foot , unbuttons his tunic and jerks it down over his arms to lock them . " You may slap his ears with the revolver barrel , to intimidate him . . . . You should also drop his trousers to lock his feet . "
