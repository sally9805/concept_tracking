Goldbugs have a new prospecting tool : the horsetail weed ( Equisetum arvense ) which grows abundantly across the U. S. and Canada . When it grows in soil with a gold content , it hungrily absorbs the metal . Last week Hans Torkel Fredrik Lundberg of Toronto told the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers that for some time Canadian prospectors had been locating gold by burning a clump of horsetail , analyzing the ashes . <P> Called geobotany by Engineer Lundberg , this method of prospecting was developed in Sweden . Tin , nickel , silver copper , many other metals can also be located by plant absorption . <P> Concentration of gold ( if any ) in horsetail ash will be far higher than in the soil it sprouted from . Hence it is practical in some cases to harvest and replant horsetail weed over low-grade surface ore fields rather than mine them . And seed selection may breed a still more efficient horsetail . At present a ton of horsetail from low-grade gold fields will yield as much as 4 oz. of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timothy hay : $7.78.
