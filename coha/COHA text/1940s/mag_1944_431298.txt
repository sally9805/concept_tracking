 | Few people know how their lives can be enriched by a full and proper understanding of this great , free service Free books are one of the great assets of a free nation . In America a system of public libraries has made available to a vast part of the population a great diversity of reading matter . A public library is all that its name implies ? a collection of books for the use of all the people ? and its value is in direct ratio to the use all the people make of it . It is the business of libraries to supply books . You undoubtedly know where the library is in your town or your region , and you already may have discovered for yourself the manifold uses it can be put to ; on the other hand , you may be a Timid Soul , who occasionally thinks of the library with curiosity or even wistfulness but has n't had the time or the temerity to investigate its valuable resources . In that case , you are missing something . Suppose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be delivered at a forthcoming meeting . Maybe your club is studying American literature this year arid your subject is Louisa May Alcott . Now , you always have loved Louisa and for many reasons you are anxious to do well by her . You want to appear to the best advantage before the members of the group , and you are really interested in the subject . You begin to cast around for something to say . Of course you can think of Little Women , Little Men , and Under the Lilacs . But you have n't read them since you were a girl , and you ca n't even conjure up a very clear picture of the books . Besides , you ca n't make a paper-out of the synopsis of two or three books that everybody has read . You may begin to feel a little frantic as the date for your paper approaches . The answer to this pressing problem is the public library . You present yourself to the librarian and state your problem . You will find her not only efficient but friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reference room to look up Louisa May Alcott in the Dictionary of American Biography . Alphabetically , Bronson Alcott precedes his daughter . The librarian might suggest that you read the short account of his life , to obtain some insight into the home life and background of your heroine . A perusal of Louisa May Alcott 's biography in this Dictionary will give you the salient events of her life and also additional references . The librarian then might suggest that you look up the date of publication of Little Women and read some of the critical reviews printed at the time . Poole ' , Index to Periodical Literature which is in most reference rooms would help you locate the issue : of old magazines containing thesE long-ago book reviews . If your paper is really ambitious the librarian would suggest tha you read a full-length biography of Miss Alcott , and she would takt you to the card catalogue to lool up her name . In the file woult appear in alphabetical order card for all the Alcott books the librar , owns , followed by cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These are the subjec cards , the biographies and criti cisms of her as a writer , arrange in a separate alphabet , by author You should choose the one the seems most interesting . Whatever the size of the build ing , the librarians are genuine glad to welcome you , not effu sively but effectively . A libraria has no ulterior or missionary me tives , and her curiosity is limite to the facts related to your use E the @#  | library . If you will tell her , without too many reservations , what you really want , you may spend an interesting and profitable time with her . It is wise to go to a library for an introductory visit when the whole town is not there , with lines of students and other readers waiting for the charging or discharging of books . So choose a quiet , midmorning hour for your visit . The librarian will register you for a borrower 's card , which comprises sign-. ing your name and address and giving a reference . The librarian then will explain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may have ; how long you may keep them ; the library 's rules about the circulation of new and popular books . These simple rules and regulations are intended not to restrict but to distribute privileges . Then she will introduce you to the library . The card catalogue is a collection of cards filed alphabetically in the drawers of a cabinet . All books and important pamphlets in the library are represented by a card or cards in this file . The catalogue has a card for the author of every book , a card for all distinctive titles of books , and a card or cards for each item under the subject . When you look up Louisa May Alcott in the catalogue , you will see how the library 's card-filing system works . The grouping of books in this alphabetically filed catalogue does not represent a similar arrangement of books on the shelves . Books on the same subjects are most useful when found together . In order to accomplish this arrangement , a system of classification is used to assemble books . An almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few facts about it may serve to make the library easier for you to use . You will find a number added to the backstrip of most books of non-fiction . The same number appears on the corner of the catalogue card . It stands for all the books on that subject . Easy to remember are 150 for books about psychology and 810 for American literature . Below that figure , or some decimal division of it , you probably will find the initials of the author 's name . These initials help the librarian to keep the books in what she calls one " class " in order , alphabeted by authors ' names and easy to find on the shelves . IF THE book you want has been borrowed , the librarian probably will tell you that you may " reserve " it . This consists of buying , at the desk , a post card you address to yourself . On the reverse you write the author and title of the book you want . This reserve will be filed with others and , as the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? will be notified that the book is waiting and will be held for 24 to 48 hours . In the reference room , books are kept instead of being circulated . Here are the books you use for source material but do not take home to read . Their use is too varied and too constant ? dictionaries and encyclopedias , atlases , almanacs , and handbooks of miscellaneous inen are . " formation , and many other books the student and research worker need for guidance and direction . You also will find in the reference room ? or sometimes in a separate periodical room ? the library 's collection of magazines regularly received . Here are not only the familiar magazines , but strange ones that prove stimulating and full of ideas . Ask the librarian to show you how to use the index to these magazines ? the Readers ' Guide to Periodical Literature . Most libraries maintain a children 's room full of books for children from the picture-book age . The importance of the work of the children 's and young people 's libraries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building of a library habit , which should be the sound basis for all adult use of books . In most children 's rooms a story hour for the children is scheduled regularly . This leads to an introduction to the books themselves , and induces young people to read what they want ? for pleasure and self-satisfaction and with no sense of compulsion . THE readers ' adviser is a boon to the library beginner or to anyone who needs assistance or advice about books . This librarian , usually released from routine duties , has time to talk with you about your reading . She has more time for the individual readers than has the busy assistant at a crowded desk , and she can and will be glad to help you plan your reading . The adviser will ask you some questions and make notes of your answers ; the information will enable her later to select books for you to read . She will make a list of these books for you , with a brief annotation describing the contents and approach of each book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading , investigate new subjects , or refresh their information , use this service . Later they talk over their reading with the adviser . Under her direction they avoid haphazard reading and their reading is more satisfying and of more lasting worth . The readers ' adviser is the person who will assist you in writing your club paper . She will be interested in helping others in your club group in the selection of reading . She wants to work with clubs , forums , discussion groups , or individual readers . Her field is adult education . Because she usually is as interested in people as she is in books , you will find her a friendly guide , anxious to bring books and people together . The public library has an open door . The librarian has a sense of community responsibility . She knows that a fresh stimulus must be found in print ? in books , pamphlets , and magazines ? if the individual 's life is to be full and worth while . She thinks all men and women want to read , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right books .
