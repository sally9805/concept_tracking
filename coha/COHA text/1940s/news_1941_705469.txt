txt Japanese Conditions Denied Referring to a Tokyo despatch in THE NEW YORK TIMES of March 16 , headed " Japanese Christians to Make Tour of United States , " I should like to call attention to the Ftatement that the Japanese members of the Board of Trustees of the Japan Bible Society proposed that they would raise an endowment of 100,000 yen if the American and British societies would donate the new American Bible Society building in . Tokyo and 75,000 yen to the Japan Bible Society . The fact is that no conditions were made on either side with reference to the contribution by the American and British societies ; and the assumption that the Japanese members of the Japan Bible Society have not fulfilled their obligations is quite unwarranted . ERIC M. NORTH , General Secretary , American . Bible Society . New York , March 27 , 1941.
