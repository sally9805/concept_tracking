FOUR QUARTETS - T. S. Eliot - Harcourt , Brace ( $2 ) . <P> In a little short of 900 lines , these subtle , magnificent religious poems contain more beauty and sense than any book within recent memory . They are capable of charming , and teaching , many thousands among the great general reading audience . <P> T. S. Eliot has never been an artist likely to please the bulk of that great audience . Simply as a rather solemn **26;8301;TOOLONG , he is personally unsympathetic to many . His work lacks commonness in the good sense of that word as well as the bad . It requires a patience of ear and of intellect which many readers lack ; patience not merely in one reading but in many . For a long time , too , it was easy to misjudge Eliot , thanks to certain of his admirers , as the mere precious laureate of a Harvardian coterie . But that time , fortunately , is well past . So levelheaded a man as Somerset Maugham has recently ( in his Introduction to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) done both poetry and plain readers a notable service by introducing Eliot to a large audience , without talking down and without so much as mentioning his " obscurity , " as " the greatest poet of our time . " <P> Eliot is , to be sure , not a poet in the grand antique sense of spontaneous and unprecedented song . But as a devoted artificer of words and as a distiller of experience , he has always been a poet , and a particularly fine one . Unlike many greater and lesser poets , moreover , he has constantly grown and changed . In his youth he was most notably a satirist ; then a mosaic artist of exquisite sensibility , a man who used the perfected expression of past artists as frankly as he used his own , to arrange , fragment by fragment , edge by edge , an image of the desolation of his time ( The Waste Land ) . <P> In 1928 , with considerable hauteur , Eliot professed himself an Anglo-Catholic , a royalist and a classicist , and the chaplet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains the most richly beautiful of his poems . In the ' 30s , taking hints in diction from his brilliant junior W.H. Auden , he wrote the poetic dramas Murder in the Cathedral and Family Reunion . Now , at an age ( 54 ) when the talent of many good poets is dead and buried , he publishes the harvest of his last seven years , these four " quartets . " Of all his poems they are the most stripped , the least obviously allusive , * the least ingratiating in image and in diction , the most direct . They are set in a matrix of subtly intensified , conversational style . To many readers they will look , and remain , flat and forbidding . But those who will give them the care they require will find , here , the finest work of a distinguished lifetime .
