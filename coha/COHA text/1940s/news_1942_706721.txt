txt A serious beef shortage , caused by what he termed unwise Government action , was forecast here today by Albert S. Goss , Master of the National Grange . Mr. Goss , who heads the oldest and biggest farm organization in the country , said the cut in production would begin to pinch in the early winter and would show up most in the better grades of beef . " It is a deliberately created meat shortage , " he protested . " We have the animals and we have the feed . " What is bringing on the reduction of supply , the farm leader explained , is the unfortunate timing of the price ceiling applying to beef . " Beef prices were frozen as of last March along with everything else , " he said . " In March the range stock is thin . We are losing the advantage of putting on 200 or 300 pounds of meat per head . They are selling the cattle because they ca n't pay the cost of feeding them . Animals Too Light " Tne result is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to market shortweight by ZOO to 300 pounds per head , and we are running short in beef at the very time when we need it most . " The farmers have raised the largest number of livestock in history , but the price ceilings will not permit them to fatten them and get the poundage available , and so obtain the benefit . This is not the farmers ' fault . " Price ceilings that have been placed without regard to rising costs are rapidly curtailing supply in a number of lines of farm production , added the National Master of the Grange . " Yesterday in Richmond , Va . just as an example , a member of , , the Milk Commission told us that dairymen were going out of business right and left , " he noted . " Here in New England and the North Atlantic States a great many dairy cows are going to  --  the butcher 's block , indicating that we are driving directly to a shortage of dairy products . Strangling at Sources " I think America 's greatest domestic problem today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm commodities . " This will create serious shortages . The main causes of these shortages are price ceilings which will not permit the producer to meet his production costs . The principal items In these costs are labor , equipment and supplies . " A policy designed to prevent inflation is thus creating shortages which are the greatest incentive of inflation , There is nothing like short supplies to stimulate inflation . " Conversely the best remedy for inflation is ample production . Price ceilings must be flexible enough to provide for ample production . The inflexible character of the price ceilings is now doing great harm . I have no objection to price ceilings if soundly applied for the purpose of preventing profiteering . " Commends Grange Program Mr. Goss ' analysis and forecast of a coming beef shortage , especially in choice and prime beef , was indorsed by Dr. E. W , Sheets , former Chief of Animal Husbandry of the United States Department of Agriculture . Dr. Sheets , who is now associated with the National Grange in a consulting capacity , came here with Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soundness of the Grange policies on the whole question of price control and effort to control undue inflation , " Dr. Sheets said . The former federal livestock Chief observed that the consumer should know that the farmer gets but a small amount of the price paid for meat . Far Under World War " In foodstuffs generally the farmer is getting less than 60 per cent on the average of the high points of what he got during the World War , " commented Mr. Goss . As to pork , the Grange leader added , " We have the biggest tonnage of pork ever coming to market . It will depend on how it is distributed and how the prices are controlled . " The pack of canned berries in some localities has already been cut down nearly 50 per cent , he said , because of price ceilings that would not permit the cost of harvesting and canning the crop . Mr. Goss came . to Boston to discuss farm problems with Masters of the State Granges of all the New England States and New York .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
