Harlem 's 200,000-odd Negroes had their first representative in the New York City Council this week , and the Rev. Adam Clayton Powell Jr . took another step toward becoming the popular hero of U.S. Negroes . <P> Tall ( 6 ft. 4 in. ) , husky ( 210 lb. ) , young ( 33 ) , Adam Powell is handsome , lightskinned , a fluent speaker , a good showman . He went to Colgate University , hurled the javelin on the track team , worked summers as a redcap in Manhattan 's Grand Central Terminal . After a year in theological seminary , he stepped into a ready-made job as assistant pastor of his father 's Abyssinian Baptist Church , whose 14,000 members are the largest Protestant congregation in the world . <P> When his father retired four years ago , Powell took over-against the protest of oldsters who had been shocked by his marriage to a radio and nightclub singer , considered him a little too fancy and convivial for a preacher . His sermons dealt with everyday Harlem problems like high rents , jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his pulpit , kissing the women of his congregation . <P> He made friends outside the church as well as in . He led a picket line of 10,000 to protest the firing of six Negro doctors at Harlem Hospital , led strikes against landlords who charged Harlem 's high rents . He established a committee which has picketed 125th Street stores refusing jobs to Negroes , boasts now that his committee has increased Harlem 's annual income by $1,000,000 . <P> Until he ran for Councilman , on a spur-of-the-moment decision , he had been only a sideline politico . His campaign amazed Manhattan politicians . With no machine support , he ran third among six Councilmen elected in New York City . Helpfully , he mailed 200,000 sample ballots to voters , showing how to mark the complicated proportional representation ballot . In Harlem , which gave him some 50,000 No. 1 votes , there were fewer spoiled ballots than anywhere else in the city . <P> If New York Congressional districts are revised , as seems likely , Councilman Powell may turn up in Washington as Harlem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
