Taking no chances on being scooped on his own long-term fiscal plans for the world , Henry Morgenthau last week released to 43 United and Associated Nations , seven Congressional committees , and the U.S. press a well-hedged description of his much-bruited World Bank. *Billed as a " tentative proposal . . . with neither official status nor the approval of any department of the Government , " the blueprint for a United Nations Bank for Reconstruction and Development was sired by the Treasury 's economist , Harry D. White . But Henry the Morgue made it plain that he had adopted the child . <P> The Plan . Basic aim of the White-Morgenthau plan is to find a way to use the world 's wealth to put the world back on its feet+ The plan proposes that the governments of the world pool part of their financial resources , search out needed investments , and underwrite those that private capital will not-or can not be expected to-handle . Its framework : &gt; The United Nations Bank would have a total capital of $10 billion ( expressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nontaxable , nontransferable $100,000 shares , to be divided among the United Nations by " an agreed-upcn formula " based on " relevant data " such as the amount of national income and foreign trade . According to Treasury definitions of the formula , the U.S. would probably contribute about one third of the Bank 's funds , Russia and Britain about one tenth apiece . <P> But the initial contribution of any nation would be only 20% of its maximum obligation , and not more than one fifth of that need be in gold . <P> &gt; The Bank would be empowered to make loans and to guarantee or share in private loans to member nations , provided:1 ) that the money is not available elsewhere , but 2 ) the loan looks good enough to pay off at reasonable interest , after 3 ) a written report by " a competent committee " has okayed the project , and 4 ) the borrowing government has guaranteed principal and interest . <P> &gt; No nation can cast more than 25% of the Bank 's votes and , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . As a club against small defaulters with big votes ( each share of stock is good for one vote , while each member country would be also entitled to 1,000 votes ) , members who do not pay up can be suspended by the same majority . <P> The Pros . Harry White 's argument for his Bank is the very argument that makes the average U.S. citizen leary of U.S. investments abroad : That the private investor got rooked after the last war . <P> He got rooked , say the Treasury , precisely because his foreign loans were made without any overall supervision , were improperly sold-and oversold-to him and to the borrower , at too-high interest rates and with too little regard for whether the money was actually used productively . <P> A World Bank , says the Treasury , should be able to police its loans much more intelligently . The Treasury pointed to the " sound banker 's " record of Jesse Jones 's RFC to prove that there are certain long-term risks which private capital might reasonably hesitate to take after the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the world , could well afford to underwrite them .
