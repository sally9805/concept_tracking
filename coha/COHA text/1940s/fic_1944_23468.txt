Edward Fenton , bookseller and poet , joined the American Field Service in May , 1942 , and was with the Eighth Army throughout the North African campaign . STILL I LEAVE MY JOY BEHIND A Story EDWARD FENTON H OLDING in one hand a cup of thick army tea and in the other his mess tin , filled with a heavy dollop of porridge on top of which lay two limp slices of bacon , Philip looked around him for a place to squat and eat his breakfast . With half his mind he was wondering if there was any way of ever getting British army cooks to learn to do bacon with any degree of crispness ; with the other , he was debating whether it would be noticed if he sat away from the others . There were , altogether , eight of them , comprising a section of American ambulance drivers . They had all come to the Middle East as volunteers , working with the British Army Medical Corps . For the past month and a half these eight had been attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the breakthrough at El Alamein . They were camped now off the highroad which the Italian colonizers had built to trace the Libyan coast . The Cyrenaican desert was hard where they were , and rocky . At mealtimes the section usually sat together , a little apart from the rest of the unit . But this morning Philip wanted to be away from them , to sit and eat alone . There had been a long drive in convoy the night before . It had seemed endless . One had to keep dispersed at a good distance behind the car ahead . The trackwas bumpy , with minefields on either side and nothing to light the way but a clouded moon . The ambulance had carried four stretcher patients . That meant that every jolt meant pain , which through some kind of unavoidable transference he could feel almost as much as they . When the convoy finally got back and unloaded the patients , there had been time for only a few hours ' sleep . Philip had n't yet washed this morning . His hands felt moist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . And he had to keep to himself until he had eased himself quietly into this day . Bending his legs beneath him , he let himself down onto a hard ridge . It was apart from the rest , and apart , too , from where the Kiwi orderlies of the MDS had gathered in their own cheerful clumps . There was a hard lump of unfeeling inside him , he realized . It had grown together out of the weeks of tiredness , the nightmare sense of never catching up with all there was to be done ; out of the shellings , when all thought and reason fled the mind like the light leaping out of a room in which the electric current has been short-circuited . There were the countless kilometers he had seen all across Egypt and halfway across Libya , banked with surrealist wreckage ; and , as a constant counterpoint , the faces of the others in the sec-tion : He had been with them so much that the sight of them chafed him . They had become unspeakably close , familiar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingernails . He took a breath . This lump , this insensateness , would have to go . There would be a moment when everything caught up , when something actually touched him and he could feel again . Curving both sticky hands around the hot mug , he took a deep gulp . Beside him where he sat grew a scrubby little bush . It was covered with tiny red flowers and , where the green waxy twigs forked , white snails clung . Philip 's sitting down had brushed one of them off . He watched idly as its crinkled slug 's body contracted back into its shell . 16 ) Y THE time he had finished the bacon and porridge , the numbness had begun to recede . The day and its component parts were taking on their own proportions . There , beyond the ridge , were the tents of the dressing station : folded stretchers stacked in heaps beside the entrance flaps , and the great red cross , their precaution against air attack , stretched on the ground in the middle of the camp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ambulances rested , their places punctuated with the sharp rectangles of slit trenches and piles of petrol tins . Farther on were the other vehicles belonging to the unit and the clean little peaks of bivvy tents . The sun was getting higher . Sitting there , feeling the morning grow warm , Philip could almost watch the heavy dew evaporate off the scrub . Figures were moving between the tents , beginning the work of the day , hurrying from the cookhouse to the wards where the wounded men lay ranged on stretchers along the ground and waited quietly for their breakfast . Between Philip and the nearest tent , a Tommy sat on an impromptu latrine , his leg in a plaster cast propped up before him , unconcernedly reading a stray scrap of old newsprint . Philip 's eyes turned to where his own ambulance was parked . Hank Simmonds , his spare driver , was standing beside it . Hank was new to the desert , and was always asking excited MAGAZINE questions about tactics and equipment , and had not yet learned -- if he ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaving now . Toilet things were strewn over the front fender . Philip suppressed the unreasoning irritation which he felt rising inside himself and looked away . Everything that he could see was ringed about by a vast circumference of hard desert . On one side it cut into the sea . At the edges , sea and sand stretched into the sky : there was no telling where one ended and the other began . There was nothing but flat desert rippling limitlessly , and the flat sea with its blue dunes . Over both the sky stretched in a huge curve . " The clear blue cupola , the dome of Heaven . . . " Philip remembered from somewhere , beneath which everything was clear and edged  --  even the shadows . The clouds which hung in it , as though suspended by invisible wires , were crisp and definite . The scene was , in fact , classic . This was the way the world was when it was early . The islands of the Argonauts , the landscape of Homer had looked like this . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seeing this shore , with its low flowering bushes and their immemorial snails and the way it touched the blue sea and sky , made the worn pages of books come clear . A thousand things interred behind the glass of museums reverted to life . Despite the barriers of myth , the rust of centuries , he could imagine ancient figures moving against it , seeing them more clearly than many he moved among daily . He wondered whether the ancient frieze was clearer because of that very thing of legend , those same intervening years , which had worn away the irrelevant details ; just as the many things which obtruded so sharply now kept the present frieze , in which he was a living part , from appearing complete to him and connectable with that other . Here he sat , himself , Philip , under that unaltered cupola , making his figuration in a pattern which he had not yet begun to understand . Into focus around him swam the MDS , the Red Cross flag flying from the reception tent , the dispersed vehicles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of battle dress . STILL I LEAVE Clayt Pierce 's voice cut into the scene . He was talking about a Luger someone had taken off a Jerry at Sidi Barrani . Then Philip saw , not far from his elbow , the snail he had brushed off the bush . It had traveled several feet from where it had fallen . A moist trail streaked the sand behind it . The slime had already begun to dry : the grains of sand which it had stuck together were falling apart in the sun . The brief chart of passage was already nearly obliterated . Something then slid across Philip 's mind . He thought if he tried hard enough he could hunt it down to some definite , perhaps important , connection . Later , possibly , he might . The sun was well up by now . Perhaps , thought Philip , there would n't be any evacuations to make that day . Then he could spend the morning greasing the car and cleaning the filters . There was some extra petrol he had been saving for that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon there might be time for a quick swim . He might even get a few letters written , although letters from here seemed , in a sense , so futile . By the time they arrived ( if they ever did ) , what little you had managed to say would no longer matter . It gave him a strange feeling of being cut off from the rest of his life , not only by time and geography , but through a subtler , less calculable dimension as well : that dimension of war in which everything had changed values and few things seemed directly connected with the rest of the world he knew . LAD HOFFMEIER , the section leader , came la over to the ambulance a little later . Philip had just shaved . His face was raw from using a none-too-sharp razor and cold water . " There 's a job for you , Phil , " Ed said . " Hop over to Reception as soon as you 're ready . " Then he moved on to the next ambulance , a tall cranelikc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the sand . That was that . When Philip drew up to the reception tent , Hank was in the seat beside him . The blankets were neatly folded inside the ambulance and all their personal gear tucked away where it would n't interfere with the stretchers . Clayt Pierce was there already . Patients were being carried out to his car . Ed was there too , watching the loading . He put his foot up on Philip 's running board . " The whole section 's going on this run , " he announced . " We 've got to go about a hundred kilos along the coast road back to the CCS . guess they 'll fly the bad cases back from there . The others 'll go on the hospital ship , probably . " Clayt was waving excitedly . " Phil , come over here a minute , " he called . " I 've got a Jerry here . He does n't understand a word of English and you 're the only one around here who knows any German . Come over and talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated . What was there to find out ? What could one more captured Jerry say that would make anything clearer ? But Hank was already out of the car . " Where is he , Clayt ? Come on , Phil . Find out what he has to say . " Clayt 's Jerry was sitting in the front seat of the ambulance nursing a broken arm in a sling . Someone had given him a cigarette . He inhaled it deeply . He had another cocked behind his ear , but he puffed as though the one he had might be his last . He was very young , with the blunt face of a farm boy . He had red swollen lips , the teeth behind them discolored and irregular . His eyes were small and blue and shrewd . He had n't shaved for days : there must have been at least a week 's growth of blond stubble on his face , His uniform was filthy . The cap sitting jauntily on top of his untidy straw-stack of hair had been wrinkled out of shape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . He sat beside Clayton , looking out with his small peasant 's eyes at the group which had gathered . Evidently the prisoner was pleased with the attention , for his face wore a broad grin . Suddenly with his good arm he gestured upwards towards the sky . " Englander ! " he said . Then in a rapid pantomime he indicated the dropping of bombs : a long whine , and then : " Bornmm , bomm , brrrrroml " The eyes narrowed to slits . He made a cowering motion , shielding his face with his good arm . Then , abruptly , he stopped . His face contracted . His hand reached up to his hurt arm . Surprise , pain , despair rushed across his face . . . . And then suddenly he stopped acting . He looked up at his audience , jerked his shoulder , and laughed . " Go on , Phil , talk to him . See what he has to say . " " What do you want me to ask him ? " " Oh , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's glad he 's captured . " Pete Thompson called out , " Ask him what he thinks of Hitler ! " and another voice volunteered , " When does he think the war will be over ? " " All right , " Philip said . He moved forward so that he confronted the boy . " Guten Morgen , " he said quietly . " Grass Gott , Kamerad ! " " Griiss Gott . " It was what one always used to say . But gradually you began to hear more and more the crisper " Heil Hitler ! " until one day even the school children no longer greeted their teachers in the Bavarian morning with the familiar words , but came stiffly to attention instead and raised their arms in the new way and said the new staccato words . " Gross Gott , Kamerad ! " Philip repeated . The German was silent . Suspicion stared out of his eyes . He regarded Philip carefully Then he glanced over Philip 's head at the group beyond . Deliberately he took out of his mouth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked at it . Aiming , he flicked it away into a bush . When his gaze finally reverted and met Philip 's again , Philip was holding out a packet of Woodbines . " Help yourself , " Philip said in German . " They 're none too good , but they 're all we can get . " Then the boy shrugged and made as if to take one . " No , take them all , " Philip told him . " You 'll want them later . " He took the packet and tucked it inside his tunic , never taking his eyes from Philip 's . Then he took the cigarette from behind his ear . Philip lit it for him . He took a profound puff . At last he spoke , his lips smiling but his pale mistrustful eyes searching Philip 's dark face . " Danke , " he said . All this happened very quickly . Then the others crowded closer , calling out questions for Philip to ask . Philip did so , and translated the replies , thinking meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one might have guessed at first . The boy was young  --  not yet nineteen . He came from Silesia , where his father had a farm . He had been in Libya only six weeks . He showed no surprise at Philip 's fluent German . " Ask him what he thinks of the Eye-ties , " Hank yelled . Philip translated . In reply , the German shrugged and laughed . But it was nervous , senseless laughter . The boy knew something was expected of him . He was laughing because he could think of nothing else . What was there to say to him ? Philip wondered . What could one really ask ? What revelations did Hank and Clayt and the others expect from this Bauer boy , this grimy Lausbub still wet behind the ears ? He had told them all he knew without benefit of translator when he re-enacted what had happened when the R.A.F. came over . He had shown how he had been wounded . What else could he say ? That was all he knew that mattered . Beyond that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back as Silesia . Yet still they asked , hoping for some clue . " Find out what he thinks of the war , Phil , " Pete Thompson called . But before Philip put the question , the boy leaned forward and suddenly began talking in German . He spoke rapidly , stopping only long enough to drag on his cigarette . All the time he ' lever took his eyes off Philip . When he had finished , he put the cigarette in his mouth again and inhaled deeply , breathing the smoke out through his nostrils . Muttering something under his breath , he leaned forward with a quick motion and spat into the sand at Philip 's feet . Then he sat back in his seat and stared through the windshield straight ahead of him , " What 's eating him ? " Danny Winternitz said . " He 's just browned off , " Philip explained quickly . " He 's sore because he 's captured ; his arm hurts , he says ; and I guess he 's worried about things at home . STILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run their farm all by himself . And to make it worse he ca n't see what anybody 's fighting over Africa for . He ca n't understand it . He says he has n't seen anything in Libya yet that he 'd swap for the poorest acre in Silesia , " Danny indicated the gob of spittle in the sand . " What was the prairie oyster for ? " Philip hesitated . " He just does n't like it here much , " he said finally . " That 's all . " " Who the hell does ? " Danny demanded morosely . He called out to the German , " I 'm with you there , pal , even if you are a goddam Nazi bastard . Anybody who wants this place can have it . And they can put it where the monkey put the nuts . " The prisoner made no sign of having heard . He stared sullenly ahead of him . HE ambulances , meanwhile , had been loaded . Philip 's had three lying cases . On the floor were two South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining as they lay waiting on their stretchers . Slung up on the left-hand side , his head a few feet from where Philip sat in the driver 's seat , was a German . He seemed asleep . Philip looked at the card the dispatching sergeant handed him . It enumerated wounds on both legs . Hank read over Philip 's shoulder . " Say , do you think he might have an Iron Cross on him ? " he said . " One of the Kiwis on the operating team got one off a Jerry yesterday . " Philip did n't answer . The dispatching sergeant stood outside the tent checking over his list . Ed Hoffmeier waited beside him for the signal for the convoy to start . The Basutos squirmed on their stretchers , but after Hank handed each of them a cigarette they were quiet again . The sergeant came up : " Room for one more in there , Yank ? Then I 'll hop on , if you do n't mind , and we 'll drive around to Ward Four . There 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the circular track and pulled up beside the entrance flap of the nearest tent . A fourth stretcher was carefully loaded on while Hank helped from the front with the straps . Philip watched through the mirror . He could see a blond head sticking out from under a pile of blankets . The eyes were closed . There was a large M penciled on the forehead . It was a familiar face . He turned with a questioning look to the sergeant . The sergeant pursed his lips : ' Whitey Pate , " he said . Whitey was one of the orderlies . It was no wonder the face was familiar . " But saw Whitey yesterday morning , " . Philip said . " What in the name of ? ? " The sergeant nodded . " Whitey and his cobber , Rodge Barton  --  you know him , the big corporal --  -- had the afternoon off yesterday and they went down to the beach for a swim . I figure the sappers had n't cleared it all up , because on the way back Whitey stepped on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . Rodge managed to duck in time . Then Rodge brought him back here , and the MO did what he could . It took a couple of pints of blood . Right now he 's full of morphia . It 's the only way we could move him . He 's a good lad , Whitey ; I hope he pulls through . " . The sergeant shook his head . " Jesus , I hate those effing mines ! " he said . " Well , that 's the lot now . " He stood up on the running board and signaled to Ed . " There , the convoy 's starting . Off you go , Yank . Take it easy with Whitey , now . " , Philip eased the ambulance into its place in the moving convoy , seventy yards behind the car ahead . They were next to last in line . Pete Thompson , who was the section mechanic , followed in case anything went wrong down the line . The track out of the camp was unevenly rutted , bumpy with much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clenching his teeth until they reached the macadam highway . After that the going was easier , although he still had to be careful of torn places in the road . He drove in silence . Hank spoke first . " Did you know him well , Phil ? " he said . " Who , Whitey ? " Philip said . " I knew him damn well . He was practically the first friend I made in the desert . That was when we were off the Cairo-Alex road , before the push began . Whitey Pate ! I used to go around to see him every day and get my desert sores dressed . There was n't much else to do then , so I used to sit around afterwards . It was Whitey showed me how to do the dressings myself . " " Oh , " said Hank . " Gee . . " Philip remembered those mornings well . It was late summer and he was new to the western desert . He had been grateful for the easy geniality in the MI tent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impersonal , even the guying . One day when none of the others had been about , Whitey had pulled a Jerry shellbox out of its corner . He opened it and showed Philip , among others , a photograph which showed him wearing a dress suit . It was badly cut . A girl in a lace evening dress stood beside him . She was a plain girl  --  too thin , with straight hair and glasses . But there was something which Philip found singularly touching in the serious intensity with which her face looked out of the photograph . Whitey explained that he and the girl had decided to get married when he got back to Christchurch and he was going to start a plant nursery with some money they had saved between them . She was a secretary , but she was going to give up her job and help him run it . Philip had regarded the picture without saying anything . What , after all , was there to say ? Then the photographs were all carefully put back in the shellcase . Philip never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could still see clearly the two of them standing in front of the professional backdrop of classical urn and roses , Whitey 's hair uncomfortably slicked down , and her earnest , plain face . . . . And now Whitey lay on a stretcher in Philip 's ambulance , half the world away from Christchurch . The drug had left his face empty , wiped clean of expression , leaving behind only a peculiar look of defenselessness . The German still slept in the neighboring stretcher . The blacks lay below , their yellow eyeballs rolling up at the ceiling while they smoked and talked to each other in Afrikaans . r convoy proceeded carefully while A the desert slid past , dotted with scrub . At regular intervals beside the road were the white stones which marked the kilo-metrical distances . Sometimes they would pass a group of jagged walls -- all that was left of what had once been an albergo , an Italian halfway house . On them in huge black letters the slogans of Fascism could still be read : CREDERE OBEDIRE COMBATTERE VINCERE , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the road curved along the shore , only one shattered wall remained . It stood there like a piece lost from some gigantic jigsaw puzzle . A piece of the sea and a cloud were framed like a surrealist painting by a gap which had at one time been a window . Across the wall sprawled the words : MEGLIO VIVERE UN GIORNO COME LEONE . . . The rest was broken off . " What does that mean , Phil ? " Philip translated : " It 's better to live one day like a lion . . . " " Than what , Phil ? " Hank demanded . Philip smiled . " That 's something I 'd like to know myself , " he said . Passing them , moving forward in the opposite direction , rolled a constant stream of vehicles . Many had names spelled out across their radiators with bits of tinfoil , or stenciled on the windshields . The faces behind them after a while reduced themselves to mere blanks filling out the khaki battle dress . Some wore expectancy or cheer ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in passing . But for the most part they sat lost in boredom ; or , as they jolted , tried to sleep . To Philip 's mind this was a truer picture of the war than any battle scene : this endless procession of dusty lorries with tired , bored men riding in them all day long with nothing to fill the waiting , staring as they moved forward at unfamiliar landscapes . They became aware of an increasing rumble as they drove on . Then the huge tank carriers rolled into sight . One after the other they passed : Lambeth Bess . . . Elsie from Chelsea . . . Hampstead eath ( the H had naturally enough dropped off ) . . . Gwennie . . . . Everything else was drowned in the noise the vast clanking monsters made . Hank 's eyes followed each of them . " You 'd think the drivers would go nuts with all that noise , " he said after the procession had gone past them . " They do n't , " Philip said . " They like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I carried one once . He told me the noise is so damn terrific they never hear anything else . When there 's an air raid going on they ca n't hear the planes or the bombs . They just plow ahead . They like it that way . Sounds funny , does n't it ? The noise gives them a sense of security . They 're probably right . If something is going to get you , it will anyway . It only gets you rattled if you know ahead of time . " " What was the matter with him ? " Hank said . " Nothing was the matter with him . He got used to it the first day . " " No , " Hank said . " I mean when you were carrying him . " " I ca n't remember now , " Philip said . But he did remember , only too well . Something had broken through that sense of security . He had watched them bury that driver before the MDS moved on from Mersa Matruh . " Look , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're pulling off the road . This must be our piddle stop . " The car ahead had halted . Danny Winternitz had jumped out . Philip signaled to Pete behind him and put on his brake about fifty yards behind Danny . He reached behind his seat and fished out the glass urinal . Then they both got out and opened the back . Inside the ambulance Whitey and the German were still quiet . Philip handed the urinal to one of the Basutos and indicated its use . " I 'll take care of them , Phil , " Hank said . " You go on and have a smoke . I wish that Jerry would wake up , " he added , " so you could find out if he has an Iron Cross . " Philip went around to the side of the car and sat on the running board . The sun was directly above him . As far as he could see , the landscape was still the unchanged stretch of hard desert . He sat smoking , thinking about Whitey . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say , bud , where 's the nearest automat ? " . Ir THE time he was ready to flip the butt into the sand , the convoy was preparing to move off again . Hank had closed the back of the ambulance . " My God , those blacks ! " he said . Philip climbed into the driver 's seat beside him , and they sat there waiting for the line to get under way . Hank turned to him . " I found something in the sand just now , " he said . " A page out of a German book ; it blew right up against me . I think it 's a poem . What does it say , Phil ? " Philip reached out to take it . The sheet was crumpled and weatherstained . He could feel the heat of the sun which had soaked into the paper making it seem almost alive . He smoothed it out and began to read the words . Then Hank saw that he stared at it without moving his eyes . " What 's the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip stuffed the paper into his blouse and turned on the motor . He waited until Danny 's car was well under way ; then he swung onto the road and followed . " What does it say ? " Hank persisted . " Is it propaganda stuff ? " " No , Simmonds , " Philip replied at last . " Sorry to disappoint you , but it 's only an old folk song . I used to know it . " He knew it still , although it was a long time since he had sung it last : the old marching song about the conscript going off to serve his time , leaving his sweetheart behind . . . And when I come , when I come , When I come back again , I 'll come back , my love , to you . Though you weep , though you weep That I must wander far , As though our song were done ; Though there be in the wide world many pretty girls , I 'll be true , my dear , to one . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my luck goes with me , I shall come back here once more : And if you still , if you still .. . Perhaps it would have been better if he had forgotten it , after all . The saddest song in the world , Katharine had said it was . Now Philip knew how right she had been . Well , he thought wryly , this was memory day . First there had been Whitey . And now a weatherbeaten page out of some German soldier 's songbook had blown into his path across the desert to carry him back further still , to a university town in southern Germany . He was sitting with Katharine at a table in the big room at Gratz 's . Townspeople , tourists , students , faculty  --  everybody went there in the afternoon , filling the place with the clatter of saucers and so much talk that no one ever heard the string orchestra which Herr Gratz hired to play anything from Boccherini to Lehar . The room was all green and gold and mirrors . Wherever you looked gilded curlicues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lyres floated across the wails in rococo flight . And there would be Herr Gratz , a genial , mustached balloon , bumbling from table to table ; while Frau Gratz flew between the kitchen and the cashier 's cage , never quite getting anything straight . Katharine would be wearing her hair in braids around her head , and her earrings and necklace of seed pearls , having what Philip teasingly used to call her " hochwohlgeborene j ungfr au " look . They would be laughing and he would address her as " die edle Katharina eon Schnick-Schnack , " and ask her how things were going up at the Schloss . And their friends would be sitting with them , Clarchen and Maxi and Erich and Mathilde , all singing and laughing and talking at once . . . . Dear God , how far away it all seemed now ! How irretrievably far ! Philip recalled how distant anything like war had seemed then . There were occurrences from which they could have drawn inferences . Now that one looked back there had been indications every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was the time when the police came and told Herr Gratz he would have to put up a sign in his caf ? excluding Jews . Herr Gratz had answered helplessly that for years everyone in the town had spent the afternoon in his cafe . How could he start turning people away now ? Furthermore , how could he tell which of the customers were Jews ? The Herr Inspektor would excuse him surely , for he was after all merely the proprietor of a cafe , not a professor of anthropology from the uni-MAGAZINE versa ) / Nevertheless , he was told , such a sign would have to be posted in a conspicuous place . That was the regulation and someone would be around the following day to see that it was there . That evening Herr Gratz stopped briefly at the corner table where a group of art students usually sat . The next afternoon , when the Herr Inspektor came around again , Herr Gratz led him through the shop , into the big room and right up to the mantelpiece . There , between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was painted with gold letters on a green background and bordered with forget-me-nots . Herr Gratz had placed it in a gilt frame dripping with curlicues . From three feet away the whole thing simply looked like part of the rococo decor . Still , there it was , although nobody stayed away because of it . The string orchestra kept right on playing Mendelssohn whenever they felt like it , and nobody ever stopped them . In fact , no one paid enough attention to know . It had been such a joke then ! But what had happened to the Cafe Gratz since , and to Herr Gratz and his wife ? Philip wondered . Then there had been Clarchen . Her parents were wealthy and Jewish . They had a big store in Leipzig . It had been there for generations . Everything Clarchen did was in defiance of her family . " I hate them , " she would storm . " They 're so stodgy , so stolid , so  --  so German ! They have n't had a single new idea in years . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack her Paris clothes and her music and go away without even kissing Maxi good-by . Months later , when Philip left , neither Maxl nor Katharine nor , for that matter , anyone else had as yet had any news of her . Nor was there any knowing what had happened to any of the others . Maxl by now probably had a commission in his old regiment , if he was still alive . If Mathildc had gone home to Belgium for the summer , she undoubtedly had not gone back to Germany . As for Erich , it would be a toss-up whether he was at work in a laboratory , sitting in a concentration camp , or lying dead somewhere with a bullet in his head . And Katharine : she was safe , STILL I LEAVE MY JOY BEHIND possibly , since there had never been any question about her family  --  unless the authorities considered her friends at the university dangerous . But there was no way of knowing , no way at all of finding out where she was . It was more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he had thought it better for her sake not to reply . Probably he ought to feel bitter , he reflected . But he could n't . What one thing was there to blame ? He remembered their last night together . Everything he had was packed . His bags were at the station , and the next morning he was going to catch the train to Genoa . Without a word they had walked all around the town looking at everything together . Maxi had given them the key to his room , and so they went there afterward . They played all the Mozart records . They talked , too ; but never daring to touch on the future . And Katharine did not cry once . But when very gently Philip began to tease her in the old way , calling her the " hochwohlgeborene Frdulein van Schnick-Schnack , " she shook her head and he stopped . They were standing at the window looking down on the town from Maxi 's room . In the street below some students were walking home , arms linked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambulance along the desert coast of Cyrenaica , Philip began to sing the words of the same song : " Muss I denn , muss I denn , zum Stadtele'naus , Stiidtele ' naus , and du mein Schatz bleibst hier . . . . " Halfway through the song a voice joined in , a husky , tentative baritone . It was the German in the stretcher behind him . Philip felt Hank 's elbow nudging him , but he paid no attention to it and kept on singing . . . The morning he left , he and Katharine went to Gratz 's for breakfast . No one else was there . They sat across from each other in the green and gold room beneath the rococo sign with its garlands of forget-me-nots that said : " juden verboten . " They did n't dare look at each other . They fixed their eyes instead on the green and gold plates , the untouched Schokolade , the unbroken rolls . Then , softly , be began to whistle the song . When he came to the part that went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still I leave my joy behind , " she looked up at last . She began to whistle too . They sang it all the way to the station . Once he was inside the compartment he had n't wanted to look out , but after the train started he could n't help glancing back . She was still standing where he had left her . He could see the seed pearls in her ears and at her throat . He saw , too , that she smiled . Her eyes were open very wide to keep any tears from coming . She was still singing . MHE song came to an end in the ambu- lance . Philip glanced into the mirror to see if the German was reflected in it . He lay with his face to the wall . Only the back of his head was discernible . There was a pause . He coughed . Then Philip heard him say in German , " Where did you learn that song , Kamerad ? " Philip named the town . " You know Germany ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Philip answered . " You are English , Kamerad ? " " No , " Philip told him . " American : But I am a volunteer with the English . " " So , " the German said . He fell silent Hank whispered , " Do n't forget about the Iron Cross , Phil ! " " Oh , for Chrissakei Simmonds , shut up , " Philip said . The German coughed again . " You were then in Bavaria , K amerad ? " " Many times , " Philip said . " Then you knew Regensburg , perhaps ? " " Yes , " said Philip . " But it is a long time since I was there . " " I am from Regensburg , " the German said . " It is now a long time since I was there also , Kamerad . " As Philip drove on the German began to talk quietly about Regensburg , recalling his city as it had been when he saw it last . As Philip listened , answering now and then , the barriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left that dimension behind , being now merely two people met in a strange place , united for a time by their nostalgia for a remembered place and a way of life they had both known and had left behind  --  perhaps forever . Was it Katharine , Philip wondered , that made him for the moment feel that this German whom he had never met before , to whom he had spoken only a few words , and whose face he had not yet seen , was less a stranger to him than the men in his own section with whom he had been on terms of daily intimacy for the past months ? Was it the song they had sung together which created the illusion ? Or was it his sentimental recollection of what had been once and would never be the same again ? It was hard to tell . The Bavarian had stopped speaking . He began , instead , to sing softly an old song from the Tyrol , full of the pain and sorrow of having to leave a place one loved : " Innsbruck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sang with him . Then they sang " Muss I denn " once more . Y THE time they had finished , the con- voy had come to a halt . From where they were Philip could look down on the wreckage of what had once been a port . Just outside the curved harbor , the hospital ship waited . It was clean and bright , with a great red cross painted on either white side . It would go all the way back to Alex , riding across the blacked-out sea all lit up like a birthday cake . Beside the road was a signboard stenciled with a large bat and the words BLOOD BANK . This , then , was the end of the trip . They had reached the CCS . Hank looked at his watch . " Took us nearly four hours , " he announced . " What 'll you bet we miss out on lunch ? " One by one the ambulances bumped over the track to the reception tent where Ed Hoffmeier stood giving instructions . When Philip drove up Ed came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent , " he directed . " Then you 'd better get your dixies out and trot over to the cookhouse on the double if you want some food . The orderlies will do the unloading . But do n't forget to pick up your blankets and stretchers afterwards . " " All right , Ed , " Philip said , and drove on . There was a sergeant waiting outside the ward . Philip handed him the patients ' cards . He and Hank reached for their mess tins and mugs , then went around and opened the rear doJrs . Philip glanced inside . Whitey 's face was still unnaturally pallid and relaxed . The blacks had fallen asleep . The German lay shading his eyes with his hand against the sudden shaft of light . " They 'll take good care of you here , " Philip told him . " Good luck , now . " " Good luck to you , Kamerad , " the German called back . Then he and Hank went of to find the cookhouse . After lunch Philip went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blankets . When he had loaded them on , the convoy was not yet ready to start , so he went back for a last look at Whitey . He did n't see Whitey anywhere . An MO was sitting at the desk . Philip went up to him . " A Kiwi was brought in here a while ago ; a mine case . Do you happen to know where he is , sir ? " The MO looked up from his writing . " Morphia case ? I remember him . If any of his kit is still in your car , driver , bring it on in here . One of the orderlies will take care of it . " " No , it 's not that , " Philip said . " I just wanted to see how he was . I  --  well , I knew him . " " Oh , I see , " the MO said . " He was pretty badly shot up , you know . He died about ten minutes after they brought him in here . Tough luck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Philip said dully , and turned away . He was no longer thinking of Whitey , but of the girl waiting for him in Christchurch whose face had looked at him so earnestly out of that photograph . The tune of " Muss I denn " was pounding through his brain . Katharine and Whitey 's girl together were somehow making a pattern in his mind . A HE made his way out of the tent , his foot inadvertently kicked the handle of a stretcher where it jutted into the aisle . Philip looked up to find the narrow blue eyes of the Silesian fixed on him . " I 'm sorry , " Philip said in German . " It was an accident . " In the next stretcher lay the Bavarian , his friend from Regensburg . They were face to face for the first time . Philip started to smile . Then he saw the man 's look . The German was staring at him STILL I LEAVE coldly , no sign of recognition on his face . The illusion of contact and understanding was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeated soldier with two wounded legs , lying in an enemy camp , regarding with hostile eyes someone who was part of the army which had taken him prisoner . It was a look Philip had seen before . It could n't be something he was imagining in the dim light of the tent . " You hurt my arm , " the Silesian was saying sullenly . " I 'm sorry , " Philip repeated helplessly . Then he turned on his heel and went blindly out of the tent into the blazing daylight . Hank was waiting in the ambulance . " Clayt got a belt off his Jerry , " he said when Philip got in . " It had ' Gott mit uns ' on the buckle . . . . Did you get the Iron Cross , Phil ? " " I forgot to ask , " Philip answered . " You 're a funny guy , Phil , " Hank said . " Here you are , right in the middle of the war  --  lots of guys would give their eyeteeth to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to what 's going on around you . " " All right , all right , Simmonds , " Philip said . " I heard you . Give me a cigarette , will you ? " Hank handed him a Chesterfield . Philip thought as he lit it that it must have come all the way from Hartford , Connecticut . He smoked in silence . He was trying to remember if he had actually heard someone whistling softly as he had walked out of the tent . He could almost swear now that he had heard that song : " Muss I denn , muss I denn , zum Stadtele ' naus . . . " Hell , he thought , it was probably his own imagination . It was all in his own mind . But it kept running through his head , with Katharine and Whitey 's girl as a sort of counterpoint . He wished now it would stop . There was no room , no time for ghosts in this new dimension in which he moved . And he , Philip , white , twenty-six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthmark below left clavicle otherwise no identifying marks , was as lost and insecure in it as all the others : as Danny , as Ed Hoffmeier , as the Lausbub sitting there so far from Silesia with his arm in a cast  --  as lost as Whitey Pate . They were all irretrievably isolated in it . In this strange country of war , points of human contact were rare and unexpected  --  at best , uncertain . Out of the morning which had already receded into the frieze of the past , he recalled the snail , briefly disturbed but carrying with him wherever he went his home , his background , his shell : his illusion of security into which he could retreat . Philip thought of the shell of noise which the tank carrier drivers carried with them , which gave them the same illusion . Philip looked around him now , meas. uring the smooth green interior of the ambulance with its neat stretchers and the St. Christopher on the dashboard . Well , this for the time being would have to suffice . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " Do you want me to take the wheel for a while , Phil ? " Hank asked . " No , " he said . " I 'll drive . " Philip switched on the motor . Then he double-clutched to shift the gear . As the car started to move he wondered how long the tracks he left in passing would remain discernible there in the sand , in that classic landscape , under the high , indifferent sun .
