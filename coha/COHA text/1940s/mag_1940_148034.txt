Over a month ago , Wendell L. Willkie 's $1,214,000,000 Commonwealth &; Southern Corp . told the Securities and Exchange Commission it would like to do some financing with and for its subsidiary , the $275,000,000 Consumers Power Co . ( TIME , Dec. 11 ) . Since then businessmen and politicos have played volleyball with rumors about how SEC would handle Presidential-Prospect Willkie 's application . Last week , criticizing Commonwealth &; Southern for dilatory filing of its intentions and for pressure tactics , SEC handed down a decision which neatly forestalled accusations that it was bent on handcuffing business enterprise . <P> Issues before the Commission : <P> 1 ) Stock purchase by C. &; S. from Consumers Power . Lawyer Willkie and the big-time law firm of Davis , Polk , Wardwell , Gardiner and Reed purposely or otherwise overlooked the fact that this kind of transaction does n't require approval . SEC did n't , ruled that the proposed $3,500,000 stock deal was exempt from its jurisdiction , told C. &; S. to go ahead for all it cared . Dissenting were New Deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Competitive bidding , an issue in the case only if Morgan Stanley and its syndicate partner , Bonbright &; Co. , were found to be " affiliates " of C. &; S. ( " standing in such relation to C. &; S. that there is liable to be an absence of arms ' length bargaining " ) . The Commission chairman , Majority Spokesman Jerome Frank made clear the irrelevance of competitive bidding " since there is concededly no rule row in effect which requires such bidding . " To speed matters up , Morgan Stanley and Bonbright agreed to " impound " their cut of the proposed $28,594,000 bond issue , do all their work for glory alone , if the Commission later found them to be C. &; S. affiliates . The Commission accepted this offer , decided ( New Dealers Henderson and Eicher again dissenting ) to table the " affiliates " question . <P> 3 ) Underwriter 's cut on the bonds amounting to a two-point spread including a 3/8 of a point managers ' fee for Morgan Stanley and Bonbright . The Commission conceded that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , the Commission made a point of asking Interveners Otis and Halsey Stuart , who tried to crash the syndicate gate ( TIME , Dec. 11 ) , if they would have offered Consumers a better bid . But investment banking 's No. 1 " outsiders " refused to get down to brass tacks , simply repeated that they wanted competitive bidding . Decision O.K. 'd the bankers ' cut , Henderson and Eicher again dissenting . <P> 4 ) New money , amounting to $10,000,000 of the proposed $28,594,000 bond issue ( the remaining $18,594,000 would refund an older bond issue paying a lower interest rate ) . Under the statute , the Commission is charged with determining if a new security issue is : 1 ) necessary , 2 ) desirable for the issuing company . Halsey Stuart and Otis had offered to put up this new money for common stock instead of bonds , to take a risk as minority holders in Consumers Power instead of adding to its debt as C. &; S. proposed . Because of this offer bond financing was no longer necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for Consumers .
