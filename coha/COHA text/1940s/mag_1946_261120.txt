The New Picture <P> Ziegfeld Follies of 1946 ( MGM ) may not be the " biggest all-star show of all time , " as its sponsors strongly hint , but it will do until a bigger one comes along . A super-spectacular , hyper-Hollywood , tnple-Technicolored variety show , it runs for almost two hours . The total impact is calculated to send cinemaddicts reeling home in a state of dizzy satisfaction . <P> Mercifully dispensing with all traces of plot , Director Vincente Minnelli gets started with a saccharine bit of professional whimsy purporting to show how the late Flo Ziegfeld is getting along in heaven . ( Director Minnelli " thinks he is doing all right , puts Ziegfeld on the same cloud level as Shakespeare . ) Once this pious bow to the Master has been made , Follies slips into high gear , runs through one unrelated vaudeville act after another . Among the best : <P> Champion Swimmer Esther Williams , prettiest amphibian of them all , sliding and slithering through water lilies . <P> Loud , ewe-mouthed , old-Ziegfeldian Funny woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her landlord and a winning sweepstake ticket . <P> Pert Judy Garland ( Mrs. Vincente Minnelli ) burlesquing a world-weary but oh-so-cordial movie queen in a dance-and-doggerel brush with the press . Tenor James Melton and Soprano Marion Bell warbling their way through the wine-cup scene from Verdi 's La Traviata . <P> Debonair Dancer Fred Astaire matching taps with Gene Kelly , also lightfooting with ex-Copacabana show girl Lucille Bremer through a magnificent pantomime of Limehouse Blues . <P> Elsewhere the talents of Victor Moore , Kathryn Grayson , Lucille Ball , Red Skelton , Keenan Wynn and Lena Home peep through the shuffle and bustle . The whole is well-buttressed , as the Master would surely have it , with the Technicolored verities of the half-naked female form . <P> Kitty ( Paramount ) , a lively 18th-Century costume romance , introduces a fullblown cockney waif ( Paulette Goddard ) to the studio of none other than the great Thomas Gainsborough ( Cecil Kellaway ) . <P> The artist sniffs , sends Kitty off to an adjacent powder room to wash . Then he puts her in position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , takes up an artistic stance , begins to sketch . It is only a matter of time before Kitty 's portrait hangs with Gainsborough 's Blue Boy at the Royal Academy , and she , a great London lady , drives the peerage half-mad with her charms . <P> Kitty was taken from a lending-library novel of the same name by Rosamond Marshall . Not the least remarkable thing about the movie is the blandness with which it denatures the heroine of the original book-as loose , if not as active , a hussy as the notorious Fanny Hill . Sample dialogue from the book : " His naked body was darker than the linen sheet on which he rested . ... I bent over him and kissed him the way he had kissed me . . . . Suddenly his teeth bit into my flesh . I gave a little moan . . . . " <P> In the movie , Kitty is almost as blameless as Cotton Mather 's third wife . But she makes out well in spite of her virtues , marrying the gouty old Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the arms of Sir Hugh Marcy ( Ray Milland ) .
