and people did n't think much of her in spite of her good looks . Though , I must say , the times I saw her I thought she looked a little coarse and she certainly had an affected way of walking to my way of thinking . ... Well , I did n't ask him to stop going with her and take me out . I did n't know about his going with her till folks told me later on . Why , I believe it was Eleanor Wright first told me and said she was so glad Henry had been saved from making such a dreadful mistake which would really have ruined him in this town and she was so glad he 'd married me and her husband was so pleased and everything would be fine now ... . Yes , Eleanor Wright told me . I remember . I guess she envied me then and always has , because there 's nobody that do n't know that that old Abner Wright always was a horrible man and always did do things you could n't so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember my father saying that a good thrashing would do that fellow no harm ? . . . Well , of course , it 'd be an insult to Henry even to say that 's not the way he is . . . . Well , of course ... well , of course ... . I 've got to get up and get me an aspirin . . . . I 've got to . . . or I 'll be sick tomorrow . . . . Be sick most likely anyhow . . . . Oh dear . . . do n't have to light a light to get to the bathroom . . . . With the moon up now it 's bright as day in here . . . . Do n't like that lonesome brightness . . . . Oh dear ... . There . . . maybe it 'll do me some good by-and-by . . . . If I could just stop thinking all these jumbledythoughts . . . . She had very full lips  --  that Rita La Belle . I can see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the way she seemed to kind of float and sort of , you might say swim , and you could n't help noticing her figure , just could n't and she had booksp101under her arm , too , which seemed funny . . . . All these years I have n't been able to get her out of my mind and there 's no use telling myself , as I have , that men are different from women and there is n't a man alive that has n't flirted with some girl  --  and you 're lucky if it was no worse  --  before he was married , not one , not even Henry . . . no , not even Henry ... . And , of course , I do n't know , nor ever will , if it was n't worse . . . . I always think of those Garrity girls down street from us with their big fine white bodies and bold eyes and what my father said about their letting the boys take liberties with them . Maybe that Rita La Belle let Henry do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How should I know ? Why do I want to know ? All I knew before I was married was words written in outhousesand horrid drawings and that no nice girl ... . Oh , those pines and stars will drive me crazy yet and not a sound from Henry downstairs to show he 's alive . He sits like a stone ... . Sometimes I think I hate him in a quiet sort of way  --  though there 's not a thing in the world I have n't done for him or would n't . He 's my husband and I 'll fight for him . . . . He knows it , too . . . . That time his secretaryAdeline Hilton had sinus so bad and just had to go way for two weeks over her vacation I thought he might hire that Phoebe Johnson with her painted lips and show-off legs . But he just laughed and said that even as a substitute he 'd prefer a serious , settled person and the person , Mrs. Pugh , he did get was even older and worse-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  there was something so funny about the way he laughed  --  yes , I wondered then if he really meant that or if he would n't have liked that Phoebe and felt sort of refreshed by seeing her and just took that other elderly lady because he knew that there was one thing that I would n't stand for . . . . Just would n't would n't would n't . . . . Maybe I 'm wrong ; goodness , maybe I 'm doing him wrong . . . . But there was something about the way he laughed  --  something that seemed to say : " Things like that are n't for me . . . . I 'm caged all right . . . . Do n't worry , Mother , I 'm not even wriggling . . . " Hedidhedidhedidhedid . ... He did so mean that ... . If I could cry . But I ca n't . Not any more . I used to plenty long , long ago and Henry used to ask me why . Because he thought he 'd certainly never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had in any way you could put your hand on . But I was lonely , just lonely . For the longest time I did n't know why and could n't imagine . I thought I was lonely because my father had died . And later I thought it was because I lost my mother . . . . And it was for a while . Maybe even for a long while . But mostly it was because Henry never settled down , because Henry always chafed and chafed and chafed . . . . Oh , he 'd deny it ; he 'd deny it with his dying breath . He is good and he is loyal . . . . But he 's always been unsettled and dissatisfied because  --  because I was n't like that Rita La Belle . . . . Why did n't I read more books ? Why did n't I learn to dance ? Why did n't I subscribe to the summer theater ? Why this and why that ? And I might have done it if I had n't sort of known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First I felt it and later I just knew . . . . Well , if he was so crazy about that Kanuck girl , why did n't he marry her ? Why did he marry me ? Well , he had , had n't he ? And was n't it right for him to settle down with me and not expect me to be something different from what I was ? Of course I was lonely andp103I am lonely and he and Joy have always been on one side and sort of put me on the other ... . That do n't account for my remembering all these years that Rita La Belle 's lips and hips . But I think I know what accounts for that . Books and dancing and theater  --  that 's all very well to talk about because that 's what you can talk about .... But what is it that women like Rita La Belle have . . . what is it ? I want to know . I still want to know . . . . It was n't like she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been known to carry on with boys like those Garrity girls . . . . No . . . . What is it ? . . . Oh , I 've thought of asking Joy  --  thought of it , yes , because she 's certainly attractive to men and she 's most certainly not like those Garrity girls in any way . And especially after Joy got married the first time I certainly wanted to ask her . But can I imagine myself ? Why , I 'd burn up with shame . And how about Joy telling her dad ? No , no , no . She would n't . I know she would n't . That 's not her way . She would n't betray your confidence . . . . But somehow she and her dad are so close and there 'd be something between them  --  something , I do n't know what . . . . I do n't know . But I ca n't ask and I ca n't tell anybody and I do n't understand . . . . But who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Think I 'd get used to things . . . . I do n't . . . most people do . . . . My mother did . She knew Father was living way beyond his means with his trips and his horses and all the doodads he thought he had to have . And she warned him and spoke to him right smart . But when she saw how miserable it made him to do without and that he was just like a small boy  --  that 's the way she told me  --  that had had his toys taken away and even his fine mustache kind of drooped andp104dragged  --  why she just made up her mind to forget all about it . And she did . And when he died real young she was mighty glad , even though it was a struggle for her and me , that she had n't crossed him and had let him do his way . . . . Well , I could n't do that . Maybe I could if it was horses and doodads ... . Maybe I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just do n't get used to things . Neither does Henry . If he did , would n't he have settled down and let me ? But what did he have to get used to ? He would n't have had anything to get used to if he had n't had that Rita La Belle in his mind all these years and if Joy had been just an ordinary girl ... . If I was a mean woman or a jealous one I 'd hate Joy and I 'm glad that I can truly say I love her dearly and do n't blame her half as much as right way deep down Henry does . . . . Oh , he does . . . . His grand goings-on do n't take me in at all . When they told her at Smith College she 'd better not come back he was furious . He nagged and he stormed and he  --  why , he cried . And of course that drove Joy in the other direction  --  shedo n't like a fuss  --  and all she 'd say was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , it was I had to tell him to let her go to that school of dramatic art in Boston and pay her way , though she would n't take but about  --  Oh , I do n't know , but not enough to live on , according to my way of thinking and what she 'd been used to . And I had to worry and worry that she was n't getting enough to eat even and catch cold and I do n't know what . And that was his fault . Because if he had n't made such a fuss Joy would n't have refused to take what she ought to have had and what he could well afford , from her own daddy . . Well , poor Henry . . . he was punished.  |p105He  always is . He never said anything and I never said anything . We do n't say things . But he must have thought many times to himself , just as I did , that if Joy had n't felt kind of forlorn and forsaken when she was n't hardly twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did and married Buck Browne ... . So of course Henry had to pretend that-it was all wonderful  --  oh , yes , wonderful  --  to prove to himself that what he did had n't had bad results . . . . He gave that Buck quite a sum of money , a thing Joy do n't know to this day ... . Oh dear . . . . And then after the wedding he said : " Now we 'll have a fine time , Mother , just you and me . " And he was as pale as a ghost when he said that and I 'm so foolish I felt sorry for him . . . . And as soon as it was decent he kept running down to Boston where Joy had an apartment on Charles Street not far from the State House on Beacon Hill and not far from the Common around where Father used to say the first Green that came from England about 1701 had a saddler 's shop and from where he came here and took up land because he was tired of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Henry would , bragging of what a fine life Joy was having and what an able fellow Buck was and that he had sold insurance to so and so  --  Oh , Judge somebody and Congressman somebody . . . . I do n't know what all . . . . But I went down too , though Henry , I could see , was n't too pleased , and I did n't like the looks of things even a little bit . Buck was polite to me . Oh yes . He came home with flowers . But everything was sort of strained and a sort of a show put on for my benefit and I 'd see Buck sneak off to a closet off the dining room and drink raw liquor out of a bottle , just tilting the bottle over his mouth.  | ... And Joy was kind of bright and ironical and pale and peaked . . . . I did n't go back any more and I was mighty relieved when she got rid of that fellow ... . I 'd thought Henry would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went on again . . . . I 'd have thought he would have been glad ... Maybe he was afraid of being too glad and so pretended to himself to be furious . . . . Anyhow that was the first time it kind of came to me that when all 's said and done maybe I did n't love Joy any less than he did  --  and maybe more . . . . Goodness . It 's most eleven . My head is a little better . But I 'm as wide awake as if I 'd never sleep again ... . Poor Henry . Raising the devil with Joy over that divorce from Buck Browne was the worst day 's work he ever did for himself . Maybe he thought he 'd scare her into marrying Gilbert Wells  --  and he was willing enough , goodness knows  --  and settling down here in Greenfield . . . . Why , even I knew Joy better than to think a thing like that . . . . Of course she was hurt that her own daddy did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she left home and took a room down in New York with that Rosaleen Defoe  --  though I never believed that that was really truly the girl 's name  --  and would n't hardly take any money and wrote bright snippety little letters that did n't tell you nothingexcept that she did n't want to tell you and said she had a job , though she never did specify . . . . And Henry suffered and suffered . And so did I , but in a different way . . . . Oh life is funny . . . and sad . . . . Because why did n't Henry when he went down to New York and all she 'd do was to meet him at his hotel or have luncheon or dinner with him somewhere  --  why did n't he have it out with her and find out howp107she was living and bring her home if she needed her own home and her own father and mother . . . . Oh no , not him . . . . He ca n't have anything out with anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say nowadays in the papers , come clean . . . . Well , I 've never been one to do a lot of talking either or to pry into people 's affairs . But it 's different with your own child , seems to me . Why , if it 'd been my father he would have had everything out of me in two minutes , just about ... . Poor Henry . Why does he have to be that way ? He 's been a very lucky man , I think . And so does everybody . He 's liked and respected and the store is just grand and he did n't get to be as bad off during the depression as most everybody and according to what he tells me the turnover the last few years has been something nobody could help being pleased with . . . . He do n't deny he gave ten thousand dollars last year when President Ellwood was getting extra endowment for the ' University and Sue says the only reason he did n't promise to give as much this year was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he said he was n't going to be inveigled  --  yes , that 's the way Sue said  --  into having his hands tied by anything so unsuitable and uncalled for . . . . Henry do n't grab for honors either . . . . He 's a lucky man and he 's a fine man . . . . He just wo n't let himself be happy . . . . You might almost call that sinful . . . . Lots and lots of people that have n't got anything like what he has to be pleased and proud with seem happy enough . . . . Anyhow he was relieved in a way when Joy came home over a weekend and told us that she was going to marry John Stewart . She said that since he had been married and divorced and she had been marriedp108and divorced they were n't even going to send out announcements but just go quietly before a magistrate . . . . And I remember how Henry sat there , relieved in a way and then again in another way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also how he got white and winced when Joy told him that he could look up John Stewart in Dun and Bradstreet . . . . It was me that had to ask her did she think she would be happy and she said that both John and she had had very sad experiences and that they were very congenial in many ways and she believed they would build up a very satisfactory life together . It seemed to me then that she was kind of worn-out and was like a person who could n't really have what they wanted but was willing to take something that somebody else had talked them into thinking just as good . . . . Maybe I was wrong . . . . Henry said that it was foolish to think so . . . it was not the kind of thing Joy would do . Well , I do n't know . Certainly looks now and has to me for some time like I was n't as foolish as Henry tried to make me out ... . What does all that thinking help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a dinner party like usual for Father 's birthday day after tomorrow or not ? I think I just will . Joy knows we always do and how would it look to her if we did n't when she was coming home and coming home maybe for a long while . . . . I certainlythink she has a right to come and a right not to have her feelings hurt first thing . . . . Maybe a lot of things would have been different if she 'd always been sure of that . But Henry would n't ever leave her alone ; he would n't ask because he never asks but just the same he made her feel he wanted to know all about her . And I do n't know that I always did right myself ,  |p109though  goodness knows I always wanted to , much as she and Henry riled me . If they had n't riled me so I do n't believe I would have said to Joy that time : " Well , if you 're so smart as your dad says and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pity you ca n't show it some way , have a fine job or make some money or make something of yourself . " Well , that hurt her something terrible , I know . Leastways I saw it had later on and I wished I had n't said it . . . . Saying things that way does no good anyhow . . . . But I ca n't see now that I was so wrong . Because how would we know that anybody is smarter than some other person if they do n't do a thing to show it ? Is n't that just common sense ? . . . And yet I do n't deny  --  never did  --  that Joy is smart . . . . All I can say is what I 've said Even my father , if I was to tell the truth , sometimes got on my nerves with his grand talk . . . . And then Henry trying to get me interested in history and telling me when we was just married I ought to read a book called The Decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Joy ... . Nobody can pretend that I 've had an easy time . . . nobody . . . . I do n't care what they say ... . Guess I 'll have chicken for Father 's birthday dinner and there arc blueberries enough left for a batch of pies . . . . After all , I bet Joy has n't had one of our real New England blueberry pies in a long time . . . . Hope the crusts come out the way they should . . . . I just know I 'll be half dead tomorrow . But Joy is n't coming till the next day and the birthday is n't till the day after that . . . . And I 'll just ask Gertie and Sue and Millie and Alice and that man of hers , Harold Bowers , and tell them they can bring their girl if theyp110want to and not ask anybody else . . . . Then if there 's any talk it 'll all stay right in the family , though I do n't guess Henry trusts them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you say anything in front of that Harold Bowers it 'll be all over Meeting House Street by eleven o'clock in the morning  --  all he knows and a good deal he do n't even know . . . . It 's my opinion that Henry has given him money or leastways signed his notes at the Lamoyle Trust Company . . . . Do n't know why he should . He do n't like him and he is n't crazy about Alice . . . . Not that I care about the money . Goodness knows I do n't miss it . . . . But I hate to have Henry act as though money did n't mean a thing to him because he could n't get anything he wanted for it anyhow . . . . Yes , that is the way he acts . ... It is so . . . . If I let myself go on thinking about that and how he 'd deny it with a straight face I 'll never sleep this night , just never . . . . And I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me  --  Joy and the dinner and everything and I have got an appointment with the dentist for the twenty-first and I surely ought to keep it . ... Hope that Violet do n't run out on me . She does do the rough work when it comes to cooking for a lot of people , like it will on the twentieth . And I do n't have folks often enough to stay in practice . Did n't have anybody come to think of it since we had Rev. Stringfellow and Mrs. about four months ago . . . . Goodness that made my head ache . . . . He and Henry talked about our getting into the war and they got disputing , Rev. Stringfellow saying he was one that did n't believe in war and that a good many of the Unitarian ministers did n't and he mentioned a man in New York by the name of Haynes Holmes or some.  |p111thing  who , he said , would never give in to the wickednessof war . And Henry said it was n't a question of believing or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in murder either . But if there 's gangs out that are determined to murder us why then God , who had certainly forbidden murder , would n't blame us for defending our lives . . . . Yes , that 's what he said . Henry can hold his own with anybody . . . . But it did make my head ache and all the time Mrs. Stringfellow was trying to tell me how their daughter was sure to be Phi Beta Kappa in her junior year at Holyoke and I do n't guess  --  though that was before the piece about Joy in the Free Press  --  I do n't guess her feelings was just the kind a Christian minister 's wife ought to be . ... I came near telling her that because I know how generous Henry has been to Colonial Church , buying them new silver candlesticks and everything , not only recently but practically ever since we got married and he changed over from Baptist to Unitarian and said he was glad to do it because he 'd long stopped believingthe way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian in our church . . . . Mother thought that was mighty fine of a young man like Henry was , and I guess she was right . . . . Just the same I do n't like disputes in the house the way Rev. Stringfellow and Henry disputed . . . . It 's kind of upsetting and makes my head ache . . . . Folks are no comfort to me at all . . . . The reason I do n't trust that Violet is because she told me in a mean quiet kind of way the other day she 'd been offered a job as cook at that day nursery on South Avenue . . . . I do n't believe a word of it . . . . Why , she ca n't cook . . . . Oh well , I 'll get through the dinner somehow . . . . I know Joy will want top112help and she knows how , too . . . . But it 's funny . I never did like her messing around my kitchen the way some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm funny that way ... . There 's Henry getting up . . . . I can hear him ... . Yes . I 'm right . . . . Now he 'll be turning the lights out . . . . He 'll be coming upstairs now . . . . Oh , I 'd better pretend to be fast asleep . . . . If I do n't there might be talk . . . . And I do n't want to talk . I do n't want to . Nononono . . . . There he comes up the stairs . ... Kind of heavy . . . . Like his heart was heavy . . . . Like he was getting old . . . . And he is n't a bit old . . . . Poor Henry . . . . I feel sorry for him just the same ... .  |p113OF  COURSE . They had to be there , all of them , as early as possible : Gertie , Millie , Alice , Sue . To wait for Joy to come home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know by what train or at what hour she was expected . And they knew too that I was embarrassed because I did n't know either . Joy 's wire had n't said when . No wonder , ' considering . But that was between Joy and me . That was bearable and could have been made more bearable . But their gathering here shortly after eleven to wait  --  that was a pretty stiff dose to swallow . Suppose Joy had n't come till late afternoon ? Oh yes , they would have stuck it out and Elizabeth would have asked them to lunch and they would have stayed . Oh yes . I 'm their brother , am I not ? They 're devoted to me , are they not ? My feelings ? Well , was n't it just solicitude for me and the child that brought them here ? What a thing a family is , to be sure ! Odd enough that it was all due to Elizabeth 's unconsideredaction in telephoning Gertie . Because Elizabethis the only one who is not what might be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to admire the influence of her genteel bringing up . But she gets so confused and half-frightened and then does a thing so unlike her , which she would n't in all likelihooddo again in ten years . And promptly the wires hum . Gertie telephones Sue and Sue Millie and Milliep114Alice and Harold Bowers tells Alice whom else to tell  --  Eleanor Wright , of course , though she scarcely knows her , perhaps even Mrs. Wells in order that Gilbert might be told . . . . Ha ! At all events , there they were this morning at a little after eleven . Alone , too , at first . Elizabeth lying down , worn out after an almost sleepless night . . . . I knew she was n't asleep when I came upstairs last night : I knew she could n't sleep any more than I could till almost dawn . We both pretended . . . . Just as I do n't believe I read five pages last night , though I held the book in front of my nose even after Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Tonight I think Elizabeth will sleep . So far as she is concerned the strain is over . . . . And Joy is certainly asleep in her room because , of course , the long motor-trip from New York in this keen autumn weather had tired her and then came the scenes here . She almost literally fell asleep on the davenport after dinner . . . . So , as usual , I 'm awake and alone ... . I do n't quite see why I do n't read . Reading is like a very mild opiate and I might as well get the little good it has to give . Because I do n't really feel things with any real sharpness any more . Everything has become just an annoyance and a nuisance to me . Very little more . I 'm rasped . That 's about all . And so , of course , because I no longer really feel the thrusts  --  because I 'm , you might say , anesthetized except to scratches , why the scratches , the annoyances , the nuisances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still go through the motions . I went through a tragic gesture or two with Joy today . But I do it by rote and from memory . And I 'm just as likely to do so again to try for the moment to half prove to myself that I 'm still quitep115alive and still quite capable of feeling normally and , as Joy used to say , feeling in character , feeling , as powerfully as I used to , the things I used to feel . But I do n't . Joy can get married and divorced as often as she likes . . . . I tried tonight to feel a sense of contentmentand peacefulness in having the child asleep in her room under this roof again . No use . . . . Ca n't make the grade . . . . Mother thinks I hide behind that little ironic laugh with which I react to most things . I can see it in her eyes . She has very clear moments between her confusions  --  emotionallyclear . She has no mind , so she ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's all wrong , though her wrong inference is n't a bit stupid . That little ironic laugh is really all I have left . That 's my only reaction  --  my only natural reaction . Everything else is a little bit put on . I 'm as dry as a bone inside . I do n't even wish for anything any more . Because no fulfillment would do me any good . I would n't know what to do with it . For instance , I wished or thought I wished that since Joy did divorce Stewart and was coming home she 'd stay  --  really stay . Well , when I come to figure it out I really do n't know what good it would have done me . I would have had to pretend really to communicate with her and I would in a sense have wanted to . But that would have been pretense too . Because I 've nothing left to communicate . It 's too late for any communication . My wishes and rebellions and regrets are all stone dead and Joy , hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me voice what is within me , would have been hurt and disappointedby my silence or what she would have thought my hypocrisy and would not have seen  --  why should she at her age ?  --  that I have nothing more within.  | ... Next  --  and that was habit  --  I figured out that now , at last , she might see the value of Gilbert 's long devotionand marry him and settle down and have children . ... And I found that I really did n't want that either . I 'd have to act the proud parent and the fond grandparent and I 'd find that an annoyance and a nuisance . I just want to be left in the living tomb in which I am ... . Or , so it seems to me . I do n't imagine anyone knows himself to the very bottom . And I 'm certainly not pretendingthat , weighing one thing against another and compared to most people , I 've played in particularly hard luck . I 'm having it dinned in my ear the whole damned time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent . But evidently the particular kind of hard luck that I 've had has affected me worse than it would most people . . . . Hope so at least . . . . Because it 's common enough . I know dozens of men more or less in the same fix . They seem to get along well , not to say brilliantly . Well , to outsiders I probably give the same impression . . . . My chuckling over the funniness of that is about my only sincere contribution to life . Everything else is pantomime and shadowboxing ... . I play the game , of course . I did this morning . I did throughout the whole business . And now and then I really felt what I was saying . No , I remembered what I would have felt for many years if these things had happened and I had said then what I said now . Or maybe it was betwixt and between . Must be . Because I did have a kind of occasional tremor ever since Joy 's wire came . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning though I thought then , quite naturally , that she would have to come either on the one-eleven or on the six-forty-one .... But yet I could n't get myselfp117to leave the house and I did feel shaky after having had only about four hours ' sleep . Thought the cool air would brace me . But even after I started to walk on toward Shelburne I caught myself looking back nervously and that 's how I saw first Sue and Gertie and then Millie and Alice coming along . Amusing how importantly they walked . Except Sue . She strode like an executioner  --  eye on the gallows that would destroy her enemy and justify her . I suppose it was their being so funny that gave me the impulse to eavesdrop . Never did such a thing before in my life . . . . Never even thought before how from the conservatory one could hear what goes on in the sitting room and that one can get into the conservatory without being seen . I was surprised at myself  --  just mildly . Kind of a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . Too good . . . too sad . . . . Both , both , God knows ... . Got settled with a magazine to protect me just in case , when I heard Gertie . She was trying not to be too eager : " When did they say she was expected ? " Millie sort of fancied herself a detective : " They did n't say . " Alice started out by being decent . She always does till the rest infect her : " Well , if Elizabeth do n't know , Henry do n't either . I think he 's puttering around out back . If he 'd known when she was coming he would have gone to the store and met the train from there . They do n't know . " So Sue started the campaign ; she certainly has it in for Joy . She snapped like the report of a gun : " Just like her ! " The signal worked . " You 've said it , " Millie agreed . " She pretends to idolize him and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried not to jeer : " He ca n't hardly hold up his head . Would n't be so bad if Henry was n't so prominent . " My prominence . . . But Sue was out for bigger game : " That 's not the worst . The worst is that he 's made such a fool of himself over her . He never said it in so many words maybe . But she was the smartest and best-looking girl in town  --  " Just as well I listened . ( I used to tell Joy that they really felt kindly to her at bottom . ) Because even Alice was bitter : " And then she began by marrying that Buck Browne , a football coach or something when she was n't twenty-one . " " He 's got a fine job now , I 'm told , with one of the big chains , " Millie said . Sue was in great shape : " That 's all in the past . But she might have stuck to John Stewart . He gave her everything a woman could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park West . She  --  well , I have my own opinion . " Next they got chronological and reckoned out that Joy had n't been married to John Stewart for quite two years . Alice produced the tidbit that she and Harold Bowers had consulted whether they had to give Joy a present . " We did it for Henry 's sake , of course . " I do n't know why that made me shiver . I almost laughed so that I could be heard at Gertie 's next flight : " I never could see the sense in people marrying if they did n't intend to stick . She certainly took her time about getting married the second time . Did n't she know her own mind ? " Then Sue got sinister :  | " There was a girl at Teachers ' College summer before last when I was taking courses who knew her . Seems that after she left Buck she roomed with an actress and got a job acting herself  --  " Millie thought I must have known that . Alice agreed and that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do they own me ? Sue said that naturally I would n't . But that this girl she knew told her stories that made her sick and ashamed . For instance that Rosaleen Defoe whose apartment Joy shared was a kept woman . Genie 's mouth watered . You could hear the saliva gurgle . " No ! " She gave a little scream . Sue gathered herself together for one of her big bitter speeches : " Oh yes . They had that apartment and gave parties for men and the liquor they consumed ! Well , this girl I knew said nobody could tell you to what lengths  --  " I thought that was about enough . It 's possible too that I was afraid to hear more . I 've had pangs enough over gaps in Joy 's life  --  gaps as far as I was concerned . I did n't want those pangs awakened , though it 's hardly possible now , I imagine , by the foul gossip of envious females . So I strolled in at this point , as though I 'd just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireplace and threw on a fresh log and turned and looked them over with my back to the fire and said : " Chilly for September . " Alice agreed . Millie wanted to know where Elizabethwas . She had left them right after they had come . I told them she had a headache and was lying down a while . " No wonder , " Gertie burst out . I asked her why . Not that I did n't know how her mind works . " Well , " she said , " with all those pieces in the paper about the divorce . How can a man like John Stewartp120afford to be called guilty on statutory grounds ? ' Do n't everyone know what that means ? " " I think it 's best for us not to inquire into all that , " I said . Tried to make my voice forbidding . No good . Millie piped : " Why do n't you , Henry ? " " Oh , it 's just a thought of mine . I do n't know so many people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known they could n't be stopped . It never has been possible . Genie 's contribution in view of her own history was immense . " Maybe not , " she said . " But there 's some difference between that and two divorces and God knows what all else before thirty . " It was on the tip of my tongue to tell her how Joe Prentiss asked me after they had been married just four years whether I 'd still be his friend if he got a divorce and whether I 'd urge Gertie to let him have one . It was n't that I did n't have the heart to tell her . It just did n't seem worth the fuss. , So I said : " I prefer not to sit in judgment . She 'll tell me . " That did n't stop Gertie either . You ca n't stop a fool : " Did n't she tell you anything beforehand ? " " Only , " I said , " that the decree was going to bepronounced and that she was coming home today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never ! " that I reallyspoke sharply : " It would have been just as well if Elizabeth had n't told you . Not that I criticize her . It was natural in a way . " Sue is the only one that has a brain bigger than a hen's.  | " Are you trying to tell us to go ? " she asked . Well , why did n't I tell them to go to the devil ? Why ? Too late . Too dark . I 've never been able to tell anyone to go to the devil  --  not Abner  --  not . . . . I told Joe Prentiss he must stick . . . . Was it the early poverty ? Was it some deep , original self-distrust  --  some terrible fear , a fear of what ? Of incurring guilt ? Of being blamed ? Of blaming myself ? Too late , I say ; too dark . Anyhow , I did n't tell them to go . So I had to take the consequences . Not that it matters any more . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All that I want understood is that no one , after all , has the right to criticize Joy . Her mother and I accept her judgment as to how she is to run her life . " It hardly reached Gertie . Words do n't reach her kind . " Not very pleasant for you . I bet everyone in town saw that piece in the Free Press with the pictures . " " No one mentioned anything to me , " I said . " That 's worse than if they had ! " Alice cried . That was of course not her observation but Harold Bowers ! It took me a little by surprise . " I can stand it , " I told them . " You need n't worry over me . Joy is Joy . I do n't say it might not be better for her if she were just an ordinary person like the rest of us . She is n't  --  " Genie interrupted me with a scream : " Well , I like that . But I better keep my mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say that about Joy ? Why did I give the fool that opening ? Why do I commit these small betrayals ? It was that . Never mind what I feel about joy 's latest performance , she has n't even the right to comment . Not she . Not anyone . " We wo n't discuss it , if you do n't mind , " I said . But I knew right awayp122that I had n't been sharp enough . Same old stuff year in year out . I mean to be sharp and I fail . The great failure , the failure of failures , the great defeat , the ultimate defeat , the quite ultimate defeat suffered so early left me defeated , left me incapable of being anything but defeated . . . . I was glad that Elizabeth came in at this moment . She had that clear and childlikeand yet slightly suspicious look in her brown eyes that 's got on my nerves so often . Just then I almost liked it . And I somehow liked the way she moved her armchair a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wish you 'd all stop that kind of talk . You do n't understand any more'n I do and I 'm sorry I told Gertie . " She pulled down her skirt . Odd , how all women , younger or older , use that gesture for their own purposes . Just then it was for Elizabeth a gesture of determination . She would have her say out : " Henry pretends to understand . I do n't believe it for a minute . He 's always stood up for Joy , whatever she did . He would if she was to be caught stealing  --  not that she ever would . " I laughed and said : " I think you exaggerate , Mother . " Sometimes , once in a long while , when somehow Elizabeth cuts through her confusions , . she has strength . I used to call it the strength of the weak . It is n't . It 's just the strength of straightness . When she makes an effort to find out how she feels she finds it out . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she does n't have to be afraid to find it , because it 's always , as far as she 's concerned , according to conscience . Lucky for her . She came right back at me : " Not much , anyhow . You used to discipline her whenp123she was a child . Too much I sometimes thought . I used to feel quite sorry and take her part . But it seems to me almost like  --  no , no , I 'd better not say . " I liked her that minute . It always eases me to like her . The girls had all been so brash and brassy , Mother seemed especially fine . I encouraged her : " Since we are talking you might as well speak your mind , " I said . I had no idea for once of what was coming . " Well , like you would have liked to do some of the things she 's done . But then again you were jealous too and hated to have her married . You do n't really mind her being divorced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " She stopped and stroked her forehead . She 's just caught up with what was once not altogether untrue . Today ? I do n't know . . . . There was a queer silence in the room . She took her hand down from her fore-head : " Oh , maybe I should n't have said that . Maybe not . But there 's something to it just the same . " Her lips tightened a little in the way that has always irritated me  --  a sort of signal of willing without thinking . " Do n't you really know when she 's coming ? " " No . But if she is n't here by the one-eleven , she ca n't arrive till the six-forty-one . " " Why did n't you plan to meet both trains ? " Elizabethasked . She put me on the spot . Once in a long while she doe 's . She has no knowledge of my real feelings . She strikes out straight enough , though . So once in a while she cuts . I had so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving me in ignorance but to let it slant . Anyhow , I was prepared :  | " Because she evidently did n't want me to . If people left each other alone more and were more tolerant of each other , this would be a far better world to live in . " Suddenly Elizabeth was childlike and pathetic . I know that 's far from being the whole of her . But , as usual , that aspect of her made me say more than I had any business to say , especially before the girls . So now again this morning when in that pathetic way she said that she was afraid she did n't a bit understand Joy nor ever had , I , like a fool , burst out : " No , and often enough it seems to me I do n't either . And I was madder than the devil when she wrote me coolly she was getting a divorce again . And there 's a sense in which I am and certainly have a right to be mad right now . The piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could feel the eyes of the men at the Chamber of Commerce stabbing through my back yesterday . I know what they said  --  half in pity and half in enjoyment : There goes Henry 's smart daughter again ! Smart ! " Of course that gave the fool Gertie her opening : " Just the same , seems to me you 're always taking up for her . " Well , out of the echo of my dead rebellions I had an answer . Who would , if not I ? " Yes , " I agreed . " Because when Elizabeth says she never understood Joy , what does she mean ? She means Joy is different from her . Well , has n't she a right to be ? And different from me , too ? It 's her life  --  not ours . I 've got no great opinion of the way most people have conducted their lives  --  " I 'll always , I suppose , remember the next five minutes . They 're enough to keep me awake . Elizabeth 's eyes filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how long . " You need n't advertise it that you 're not happy  --  " What a thing for Elizabeth to know enough to say . Of course I turned to her and put my face against her shoulder and said  --  what ? Lies . Lies . Ha ! Lies are better than truth when the truth is so many years too late that it would be a worse lie  --  in action , anyhow  --  than the accustomed and expected and workable lie . . . . I heard Sue 's level monotonous voice . Why the devil does n't she caw like the crow she is ? " That 's very fine talk of Henry 's and it might apply to some cases . But when it comes to plain drunkenness and plain immorality of the worst kind  --  I do n't think this stuff about people leading their own lives applies very well . You could defend anything that way . Any-thing  --  " Just at that moment the doorbell rang and I heard the maid padding through the hall . I knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxi man to put her valises down . What a voice the child has  --  soft , yet with a kind of strictness in it somehow , moving too . . . . I wanted to rush forward and did n't quite dare and did n't quite  --  Oh , how many times the same thing has happened .... I stuck by Mother and watched all those eyes turn to the door . There she was suddenly . . . . How she makes everybody else simply disappear with her dark hair , longer than usual this time , and her blue eyes and wonderful forehead . With her dress too . That tailored beige coat and beige woolen dress and tobacco-brown felt hat and shoes and gloves and bag . Just perfection . And yet I know from the way she 's sometimes come to the store that she probablywent into , say Saks Fifth Avenue or Bonwit Teller and picked up the whole ensemble in a casual yetp126quite precise way in about twelve minutes . When you think  --  and I ought to know  --  how females shop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment and then flew straight into my arms : " Daddy ! " Oh yes , I was moved . There was a lump in my throat . But , well , the thing has happened more or less this way too often and with results that did n't either justify the first emotion or else turned it into something else . . . . But that is n't all ; that is n't the main thing . I 've had to live ; one does ; one even wants to . O.K. You ca n't live with pain the whole time , especially if there 's no counter-balance . Of what ? Some satisfaction that really reaches you . So you get into the habit of repelling pain , keeping it out  --  and with it any emotion of delight , let us say , that you damned well know has a habit of turning into pain . Oh , I can face it quite bleakly nowadays . I prefer Joy to be away and to have my meetings with her casual and almost conventional . Anything else lets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain . Tolerable enough to suffer if it gets you anywhere . But as things are ... . I was on the point of nudging joy . Did n't have to . She turned to Mother and kissed her and said : " Hello , Mama , how are you ? " Elizabeth was needlessly plaintivebecause Joy had come to me first : " Oh , pretty well , I guess . But why did n't you let us know  --  " " Tell you later , " Joy said and looked around . She had n't been altogether aware of the aunts right away , I suppose . Now as she stood there tall and in a way triumphant her eyes hardened a little and a gleam of mischief stole into them . " Hello , everybody ; I am honored by this reception . "  |p127Like  a fat jumping-jack , Gertie had to stick out her head : " You do n't seem very pleased to see us . " There was the tiniest note of laughter in Joy 's throat : " I imagine the mutual pleasure is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl ! Why did n't I let it go on ? Why do I have to smooth things over that should be rough and try to make peace where there is no peace and should be no peace ? Well , I did . I said : " Take off your things , Joy . Have you had lunch ? " And then , of course , Elizabeth said : " There 's plenty in the icebox . Want me to help you get it ? " " No thanks , Mum . I had something on the way . " She took ' off her hat and shook her dark mane into place and tossed her coat and hat and gloves and bag into a chair . What is it about Joy 's movements that is like music ? She stood still and smiled  --  that smile of hers that 's so brilliant and yet so sad , and balanced herself for a moment on one foot with the other slightly raised behind her and her arms outstretched . Where have I seen that gesture ? And she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be home once more ! " For a moment , just a moment , I felt warm inside the way I used to do . " Just as lovely for us to have you . " Joy dropped her pose and looked at me and drooped a little and the warmth went out of my breast . And she said : " Or would be . . . could be .... " Maybe I 'm crazy . But in the silence I had a sensep128of something like a knife being whetted . Sure enough Susan spoke up in her scratchy monotonous voice . I felt like stopping her . But Joy raised her hand a little and listened very carefully . " You mean it would be fine to come home between adventures and have nobody care or question . It would be fine if there were no articles in the papers to bring disgrace on your father and your mother and the whole family . It would be fine if you could do exactly as you pleased and not have to take any of the consequences of your disgraceful actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slow little nod so that her long hair swung forward : " Yes , Aunt Sue , that 's exactly what I mean . What a clever woman you are  --  much cleverer than I thought . If ignorant people did n't sit in judgment without any right ; if the papers minded their own affairs ; if Dad 's business associates and friends regarded him with the affection he deserves and were n't secretly pleased to feel superior to him  --  when they are n't worthy to unlatchthe buckles of his shoes  --  because there 's a black sheep in the family  --  Oh , how right you are ! If people had a little goodness of heart and were n't so supremely rotten ! Yes , yes , then home would be a lovely place .... " She stood there facing them , so slim , so lovely , so alone . I went over to her and stood with her and put my arm about her shoulders . . . . God , I used to have a dream once or twice years ago that Joy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Hawthorne 's story . . . . I said : " Do n't work yourself up into a state , Joy . It 's not as bad as all that . "  |p129I  thought she turned a little pale and sort of murmured : " Maybe not , Dad . " At last , at last they got up to go , the four of them . Of course they 'd been squirming since Joy had answeredSusan . People like my sisters , most people for that matter , I 've noticed , ca n't stand being answered , ca n't conceive of their being wrong and so being set right . They regard any answer to them as just an insultingnoise . They cackled at Elizabeth , all except Sue , who was white with rage and did n't say a word . Next they cackled at Joy . " Well , I guess I 'll be going . Come to see me , Joy , when you have time . " That was Millie , I think . Gertie rose to the occasion again in her opinion : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was you . " Alice accepted the lead : " That 's right . And I 'm sure glad for your father 's sake that you 're looking so well and elegant . " She 'd been estimating the cost of Joy 's outfit to tell Harold Bowers about it . Where do they come from ? What have I to do with them ? Why should they be here ? Why should . . . What is the use of even thinking such thoughts today ? What ? . . . I let them go . They trudged across the rugs of the other room . The door closed ... . Joy stood there looking suddenly smallish and forlorn . Her eyes were on her mother : " You do n't look awfully well , Mama . " " I had a headache this morning . It got some better . Now it 's worse again . All this talk . Oh me , oh my . What 's the use of it all ? If you do n't mind , Joy , I think I 'll go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mind , " Joy said in a toneless voice . Elizabeth went out and Joy , still standing , lookedslowly around . She looked at a chair as if it were aitp130strange object . I saw her dig her nails into her palms . I knew how she felt . God , I knew . . . . And maybe now would have been the time to have it out  --  all  --  all  --  to face it with Joy . . . . I knew I would n't ; I knew I could n't ; I knew it would all no longer be true today . . . . Talk today of pains I felt years ago as if they were present , as though anything could be done ? Might as well discuss the rheumatism of a man that 's been in his grave for years . Just as sensible and useful . . . . So I smiled a kind of a used-up smile and said : " Poor Mother . " " Yes , " Joy answered only half listening . " Not , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circumstances . " Kind of dreamily Joy said : " I suppose so . " Then she seemed to rouse herself . " What do you mean exactly ? " " Well , she does n't really grasp anything , " I said . " Still she was so glad you were coming she telephoned Gertie . Maybe that was a mistake . But it just goes to show  --  " " What ? " She tried to hold me , call me to accounting with her eyes . So I laughed and said : " That her heart 's in the right place . Sit down , Joy . " " I do n't seem to be able to , " Joy said . " All the homelessnesscomes over me again . " That cut , though the old edge is dull enough . Ha , home . . . . I 've brooded on that . . . . Home  --  oh , I know , I 've known for long  --  home is a place where two people , two , keep all their treasures because each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings are broken and the other is the keeper of the cage and rejoices at each gradual breaking of the wing . I 'm an expert ,  |p131I  guess , on the meaning of home . But I wo n't discuss the problems of flight today . . . . Talk to a man with spinal paralysis of doing track stunts . Funny . Ghastly . ... I played the old game : " Why , Joy , what do you mean ? " " Here we are again , as we used to be , Dad . " " I still do n't see . " " You pretending that you and I understand each other and , somehow , have a common point of view . " " Has n't that always been the case ? " I asked . I have believed that . I did n't want to be robbed of that , too . But Joy was clearer and more insistent in her clarity than ever . I might have known at that moment what came out a bit later ... . " And the minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact on which I could lean , you subtly got out from under and  --  became my enemy . " I know I got palish . Never been able to control that .... " How can you say a thing like that ? " Her voice was sad . Yet it was triumphant too . Strange . ... Reminded me of birds suddenly rising in a field ... thrushes . . . meadow-larks ... . " Because it 's so . Because it 's so terribly true . You lured me on and then deserted me . Oh , not knowingly , not maliciously . But you did  --  over and over again . And that , with Mother being what she is , made me feel homeless here , homeless in the world , homeless in the universe  --  " Yes . Yes . Yes . . . I can see it . . . . But would it have made her feel less homeless to have a full view of my own homelessness , my nakedness to all the winds  --  like my pines , like my wild storm-contorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that , not to Joy , not top134I 'd gone crazy . The irony . . . . Ha ! . . . Blandly the child puts my whole misery in a nutshell . As if I did n't know . . . . As if I had n't been punished for not acting according to that knowledge for thirty years . . . . Thirty years . . . . Go on telling me , I thought ; go on trying to rip the grave-clothes off . . . . They 're strong , all right . So I said : " What do I mean then ? Maybe you know . " " You mean slicker compromises with all that irks and degrades , the cultivation of a thicker skin . You do n't mean exercising your own moral judgment and telling all that falsifies and trivializes your life to go to  --  " I ought to be so damned grateful that Elizabeth came in just then with her hair half down , with her eyes half-sleepy and half-alarmed . Otherwise I might have spoken out at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has missed the supreme moment of his free choice and been a coward and a slave at that moment , he 's finished . He ca n't step out into nothingness , emptiness and leave his murdered  --  murdered then to no purpose even  --  behind him . Yes , I might have . . . . And the more fool I. . . . Thank heavens for Elizabeth . She said : " Are you two quarreling ? You woke me up way upstairs shouting so . " We had n't been shouting a bit in fact . But Elizabeth has fine ears . " No , Mama , " Joy said calmly . " It 's just a discussion . I did n't realize we were raising our voices . " " Of course not , Mother . " I reassured her . " You can go back to rest if you want to . This would n't even interest you . " I did n't want her to go . But this scene had happenedp135so often  --  Joy and I talking and Mother coming in with that flicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussing her or else digging up the foundations  --  the very thing I 'd determined not to do . Odd . For once she was almost right . Almost . She sat down in her chair which was next to the one Joy had taken . " Well , I do n't know about that , " she said . " Guess I 'll stay a while . " Joy laid her arm lightly across her mother 's lap . " I 'm tired too , Mama . And talk gets you nowhere . " Elizabeth amused me . " That 's what I 've always told you and your father . But seems like you two are always preaching at each other . " Pity I could n't have kept back my cheap ironic laugh . " Preaching ! Very good . Well , that 's certainly what Joy was doing . " I looked at Joy . She certainly seemed tired . She 'd been elated when she first came in . Now she really drooped . So I said , naturally , that she 'd better go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bags up for her . And somehow  --  but that was natural too  --  it was bound to come , worse luck  --  bound to  --  I looked at my watch . It was barely one o'clock now . A puzzled uneasy feeling came over me and I said : " By the way , Joy , it was embarrassing that you did n't let us know when you were coming . " " I know , Dad , " she said . " That was rotten . I 'm sorry . " " And you were here before twelve . You could n't have taken the train . " It did n't matter , of course . The thing was bound to be said , even if I had n't pried . " No , " she said . " How did you come ? " I asked  | " I motored down . " She was very grave suddenly and drew herself up . That egged me on . " But you came here to the house by taxi . " " Yes , the friend with whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a taxi from there . " A wave of heat shot up in me . Why ? Why ? " What friend ? " " The man I 'm going to marry , Dad . " . . . Well , maybe it was good to feel something again , if only pain and fury . And neither the pain nor the fury have lasted , as they used to do . I used to go around for days with a feeling as if my bowels were melting in my belly ; there were long periods when I retched at breakfast every morning and was afraid that Elizabeth would notice . Nothing of the kind now . Maybe I ought to be grateful for that . Maybe I ought to be grateful that I could go over to the store after Joy and her mother had gone to their rooms and see a couple of salesmen and give some orders about the inventory sale . I feel merely dull and a bit stunned . But at the moment of Joy 's revelation some of the old fury spurted up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appearance of a white rage than the real thing : " You drove with him most of the night from New York ? " " Yes , Dad . " " And , of course , you were recognized at the Green-field ? " " Yes , Dad . " For once I yelled . I have n't yelled in years . In a way , it did me good ; it felt good ; I felt alive for a minute . " That finishes it . That 's too much . I guess Sue was right . I 've stood by you , joy . But I ca n't any more . Youp137look so  --  so pure  --  so  --  No . I ca n't . Just ca n't . I thought you had come home to us , to me , to us . " " I did , Dad , " she said . Oh Joy . . . you can be so truly sweet  --  sweet from the very heart . But I was in no condition to be disarmed . I laughed my ironic laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force the note : " For the parental blessing , maybe , on marriage numberthree in seven years ? Would you mind very much telling me why the devil you did come ? " " Because my heart so bled for you , Daddy dear , as it always does . I did n't want you to hear the news from strangers . I wanted you to meet Anthony  --  " Somehow the name of a man crazed me for an instant : " You could have spared yourself the trouble . You could have spared me the misery . I 've met Buck Browne and John Stewart . You can spare me your current men after this . You can get out of here and go down to the Greenfield and complete the disgrace you 've begun ! " There was a humming in my ears . Yes . Quite right . A strange kind of humming . Joy looked at me wonderingly , inquiringly  --  trying to fathom my motives  --  trying ever so tenderly , I could see that , to understand . There was a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything stood still . God knows what Joy and I would have done or said if for once , for once , Mother had n't come to the rescue . . . . " Oh no , Henry Munson , she 's not going down to the Greenfield . She 's staying right here , if she wants to . She 's my baby , after all . " Yes , I could go over to the store . I 'm sure a man I met in front at the corner of Jewel and Meeting House Streets did n't notice anything queer about me . Nor the salesmen , nor my heads of departments . Peculiar ,  |p138though  , how everything was sharp  --  the odor of cloth , probably the dyes , as I passed a counter of bolts of new fabrics . . . the leather in the shoe department . . . the women in the elevator to the office-floor . . . . They were pretty nauseating  --  sweating , as I 've noticed before , with the eagerness of shopping . You could see the stains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At first my office seemed a strange place somewhere out in limbo . Funny . . . . I thought I 'd find it tough to go home to dinner . But by that time the numbness had set in . . . . We had chicken pie , which I do n't much like . Too hot and messy . . . . Elizabeth acted sort of satisfiedand at peace . Not a gleam of suspiciousness in her eyes . Joy acted as if she felt quite close to her mother but without shutting me out in the least . She told about a few plays she 'd seen in New York ; she asked me if I had read a best-seller  --  I forget which  --  and said she was tired of characters who were almost subhuman and who , therefore , with the best will in the world , one could n't relate to one 's own sensibilities or to one 's own experience . I did n't say much . Told her I 'd been readinghistory , as usual  --  re-reading , mainly , Gibbon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tease a little , as she usually does , but used a new tone especially about Gibbon  --  saidhis work was great and needed to be read and closely pondered in view of the terrible things that were happening in the world in our time . She looked up suddenly and added : " Most people are hardly aware of what 's happening , Daddy . It 's heart-sickening that our country does n't enter the war . . . " That sent a shiver through me and sort of paralyzed me . Joy had never said anything like that before in her whole life . And that was because she had never been under anyone 's influence all her life nor had taken on color from any/body 's thoughts or opinions all her life . Now there was some one . . . . I had n't intended to ask about this man or about what she was going to do anyhow . Now in a sense I did n't have to ask . I knew . I felt a strange gray desolateness creep over me . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth and yawned and asked to be excused . Mother said her headache was better and so she 'd try to make up for lost sleep . So here I am again in this house which is not empty and yet empty for me , as I have been year in and year out , with a book which I want to read and which I ca n't read because my attention wanders  --  wanders out into a void , since there is nothing but a void for me in the world and has n't really been these many , many years . . . . Oh , I know . I tried to fill the void with the child . But it is n't just and it ca n't be done . Her life is her own . . . . I ca n't reconcile myself to what she 's done with it up to now , but that does n't alter the fact . And I do n't forget , no , I do n't , that I shaped my life to please and conciliate others and certainly Joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a little better . I am pretty tired of the frictions and whispers and annoyances . That 's all . . . . I 'd like , at least , to be left alone . . . . Wonder if Mother is asleep ? Do n't want to go upstairs till she is . . . . Want silence , silence , silence  --  at least silence and no words and no bother .. .  |p140MUST  GIVE my hair a good brushing tonight . Did n't touch it last night . Just tumbled into bed and slept . No wonder ! The drive with Anthony from New York was magnificent ; we did n't say much . But we were so intensely together and the sharp wind blew and the stars raced backward over our heads . . . . And then  --  too , rotten  --  Gilbert had to be in the lobby of the Greenfieldand had to see me get out of the car with Anthony and , of course , the situation was in a way obvious . And I owe Gilbert nothing  --  not really . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cruel  --  of all things not cruel  --  and I always or , at least , far too often , succeed in being just that . I ca n't learn to think ahead as other people seem to do . . . . Never dreamed of running into Gilbert ; never dreamed of the aunts ' gathering ; did n't even dream  --  and that was stupid  --  of Dad being miserable and outraged at the turning up of another man . . . . Of course I howl at the notion of Anthony being just " another man . " But Dad ? How is he to know ? How weirdly decent Mother is in crises . Woman 's intuition ? These generalizations , as Anthony says , get you nowhere . . . . My hair is wild . . . . Think I 'm beginning to get an inkling . . . . When I 'm terribly intent on something ; when I 'm quite , quite sure that something is absolutely right  --  oh , wonderfully right and wonderfully beautiful  --  I feel as if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and must be happy with me . I take it for granted that everybodyp141will understand and approve . . . . How can they when they 're on the outside of my experience  --  and not only that , but when they approach it and view it with their preconceptions of me , which are all wrong , and with the general preconceptions about things which are perfectlylousy ? My cheeks burn  --  they really are hot  --  when I think how I drop all consciousness of how my actions must seem . Poor Gilbert , for instance . . . . Divorcedten days ago and driving all night from New York to Greenfield , to Green field , with a man . May do him good . May finally cure him of that yen he has for me . Poor lamb . . . . He never could understand that he had nothing to give me except his wanting me and that it 's not arrogant or wild to find that insufficient for a life . Most girls do actually seem to think it 's enough if a man wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and so men are surprised when their willingness or even their hot eagerness is n't accepted . That 's why I often despised Gilbert . All that he had to give me was his desire for me ; all that all his goings-on showed was that . It never occurred to him that I 'm a human being , too , with desires and tastes and even aspirations and that he had n't a thing with which to satisfy me . And Greenfield and the families and the bank . . . . I could never have got away . . . never . . . . So I wo n't worry about Gilbert any more . . . . Dad . That 's another story . . . . I ought to have thought of his feelings . I know he ought to know better than to take a conventional attitude . But if he wo n't let himself know what he really knows ; if he wo n't let himself be what he really is , what I know him to be  --  then it must be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my job to consider that . . . . Though , I must say , the situation is n't fair . Oh it just is n't fair thatp142parents should judge children and their actions not on the merits of the given case but with their frustrations and their wounds . It imposes a responsibility that does n't really belong and makes you bear a burden that really is n't yours . And Dad ! From his life there should be a pretty bright window looking out on mine . Not that I have n't made the most miserable mistakes and not that I have n't been sorry and ashamed . But Dad 's trouble has been that he has n't had a chance to do even that . Well , he has stood by me most of the time , goodnessknows , and even this afternoon what he asked for was n't , as far as he could see , so much to ask . And Anthony seems to agree that it was n't so much . Amusing , by the way , how men understand each other and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oddest occasions . Of course , it tickled me in a way to have Anthony understand Dad 's situation with such warm sympathy . . . . Guess that 's more than the forty strokes of the brush prescribed by respectable hairdressers . . . . Wo n't be able to sleep tonight . Too soaring ! How black against the sky out there the pines are and I can hear the elms shedding their leaves . " 0 wild West wind , thou breath of autumn 's being . . . . Destroyer and preserver , hear , oh hear ! " There really is n't much of a wind tonight and I 'm happier , it seems to me , than I 've ever been . . . . It 's Shelley 's rhythm that gets me and the nostalgia . . . . And the nostalgia echoes for me a thousand moments . Greenfield and home were always nostalgic for me . . . . There never was any fulfillment . . . . When I was a little girl I yearned for a home I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I loved my real ones , and for my very own self which I wanted to be so different from what it was  --  beautifulP143and heroic and self-sacrificing too . And the more I yearned the lonelier and the more enclosed within my dreams and yearnings I became and almost resented any intrusion of reality and wanted to be left alone with my yearnings and with my images of how everything and everybody ought to be . .. . I did n't think I was particularly good-looking either and wondered a bit later why the boys began to come around and were so insistent and so all over the place . I walked among them like a fey , far-away creature and I meant to be fey and far-away . I was n't going to let any common reality approach me , let alone get hold of me in any way . But I honestly do n't think it was arrogance ; there was even a kind of humbleness about it . I just wondered how everybody could be satisfied with things as they are and with themselves , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me so shabby and second-rate and inadequate . And so I began to live all by myself in a nostalgic private kind of a world . And , of course , I never said a word about it all to anybody because I thought that nobody had ever ever ever felt that way before and what was the use of talking . . . . And school  --  what was it to me ? Oh , I learned quite a bit . But it all seemed to me so irrelevant . I could n't even have formulated the questions I wanted answered at that time . I could n't have asked . But I did know that nobody told me anything I needed or wanted to know . . . . Anthony sincerely , I 'm sure , thinks I know a good deal some ways  --  about life and about , oh , I suppose he means beauty . But I know he 's amused by my ignorance of the kind of things that most supposedly well-educated people do know . . . . But no one at school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awakened me to what they had to say or meant to im- part . So I went on living quite privately , quite by myself and did n't form any close friendships with other girls either because I thought they were satisfied with such little meager things and thoughts . . . . And they were . And people are . And I still think , in spite of my formal ignorance and in spite of my bitter mistakes and wild experiments , that people are satisfied with just husks and then try to pretend to themselves that the husks are good to eat . . . . Take Aunt Sue and the stuff she got off yesterday . She 's a highly educated woman and a teacher and she knows nothing , less than nothing , about the really important living things . . . . Take Dad . No , he knows . And that 's his tragedy . . . . Maybe considering the kind of lives that most people live it 's better for them not to know . No , that 's not true either . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all according to knowledge they would n't have to live so grimly and so falsely and so disconsolately , whether they know how bad it is or not . . . . There I go again . Even now . Well , why not now ? Now at last maybe I 'll have some little right to talk . But it was comical as well as tragic how out of my utter ignorance of life I used to try to tell people how they should react and what they should do . Yet , though my facts may have been all cockeyed , my feeling I still think was right . It was , after all , a feeling for truth and cleanness  --  that people should be altogether candid and pure and seek what they needed and not put up with leavings that made them shudder inwardly . Most people , though , I suppose , do n't even know what they want or what they need  --  what their souls need . Or wo n't let themselves know . There is so much darkness in people 's souls . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . What was it but darkness , at least a darkening that made mep145do some things I 've done ? But my darkness , I think , was n't just bleak ignorance of what I wanted or fear of wanting it because it was different from the wants of others . No , I do n't think it was that . What was it ? It was despair of ever on earth seeing anywhere a gleam of anything or anyone to answer the cry of me , the cry deep in me , the cry that was crying out for what was mine . And the difference between me and other women and Anthony and other men is simple enough : they will not listen to that inner cry . Or else , when they hear it they hush it ; it is n't proper ; it frightens them ; they do n't know where it will lead them . They do n't want to be led on by it . They might find themselves in some outer wild . . . . College was bad . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studious girls were so spiritless ; they seemed to me just to grind along . The others were fools . But my soul and my feet were dancing and the studious girls ' souls seemed to have no rhythm in them and so I rushed around with the fools and accepted all bids to all dances and wore silver slippers even to class  --  not out of frivolousness  --  of course no one saw that  --  how could they ? But out of protest against the fact that the studious girls with whom in a sense I belonged had no souls that danced but souls that crept and obeyed . And the worse my conscience got for not studying and not using my mind , the more wildly I danced and cut up and broke every regulation and wandered out under the moon after hours and smoked in dorm and generally disported myself like an imp , mischievous and perverse . . . . One right word could have broken that spell . . . . Just one . . . . Why has no one ever spoken the right word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They took me for a type . Sub-deb . Deb . Wealthy parents . Good-looking . Swell dancer . May have a brain but why should she trouble to use it ? Skater on thin ice . . . . And , of course , since no one heard my soul crying out I played the part and even overdid it and got more desperate and more desperate . . . . It was sweet of Dad after they shipped me from Smith to offer me the tour to Europe . He wanted me here that summer . But he had a hunch I 'd be unhappy and bored and subjected again to Gilbert 's hot insistence . In a way Dad wanted me to marry Gilbert  --  if I was going to marry . But he did n't mind putting off the evil day . . . . Poor Dad . . . . I did n't specially want to go to Europe  --  certainly not on a conducted tour . I wanted to seek  --  to discover life  --  not to go sight-seeing . . . . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of culture like retrievers . Their slim noses reached out and sniffed . The men were too prissy for words . One , a Yale instructor  --  I can still see him  --  seemed quite human and decent . But he took me for the " type " and avoided me . Poor Dr. Bray . I 'd catch him staring at me . But he was frightened . Thought me a sophisticated wench . Well , I did act the part a little . Almost to the point of world-weariness . I wanted so passionately to know about life and had so little chance and knew so little that I pretended I knew  --  everything . . . . Why does it all go racing through my mind tonight ? Ah well , Anthony here and Dad 's birthday once again and the aunts  --  those voices of the mob  --  showing me up and Dad hating it and defending me and yet in a way agreeing that it looks the way the mob figures it out and wanting at least with a part of him to be spared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I were telling it all to Anthony , though he 's down at the Greenfield , sleeping well and tight , I hope , I hope . . . . Oh Anthony , I wantp147you to sleep well even if I do n't ; I want you to sleep , if you need to , against my bosom and let me watch over you . I never felt that way about anyone before , and it 's a good , good feeling . . . . No , the tour was n't a great success . I 've got a jumble of images in my head  --  Westminster Abbey and TrafalgarSquare And the sweet , prim flowery banks of the Thames and Oxford , very grave and beautiful but  --  my fault , no doubt  --  without any voice for me . . . . In Paris I thought I scented something that might conceivablyanswer some need of mine . And they did take us trailing through Montparnasse and showed us the Dome and Rotonde and Coupole cafes . . . . But mainly we trotted through museums . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Louvre . . . . But it was like so much of life . You did n't stop long enough to let anything speak to you , if by any chance it had a voice . . . . And a guide gabbled so hard such empty phrases in such a dead way . . . I 've always been glad that the weather got unusually hot in Paris that July and they bundled us off to Brittany . For a few days there was no trotting and no gabbling and they left us pretty much alone in Quimper . No way , they must have thought , of getting into mischief there . . . . Oh , it was lovely and pale and delicate ; the Cathedral was all lacy , just like the lace in the shops around the Cathedral square and like the lace-caps of the women and like the sweet , chirpy sound of the Breton language they all seemed to speak . Such a faint washed pale-blue sky and sunlight of such delicate gold . . . . Exquisite . . . . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my window . It was all cool and gentle and healing and I took stock of it . . . or I thought I did . And I thought I found out that I did n't know enough to get the meaning of all I 'd been seeing and that , anyhow , what I needed to know was n't history  --  at least not then  --  or the history of art , but something about the meaning of life for an American girl like me in 1931 . Perhaps it was there or in Venice and Florence and Rome to which we were whisked afterward , and I did have moments of the quite breathless love of something I did n't quite grasp in front of Saint Mark 's and at the Uffizi and on the Forum . But there was no voice for me . . . . Oh , there were voices like great choruses singing . . . . I must tell Anthony that I was n't so dumb as not to be aware of that . . . . But I could n't establish any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the way back the Lago di Garda was like one great baroque jewel or a cluster of them  --  rubies and emeralds . But for the first time in my life I was homesickeven for Greenfield , not that I did n't know even then what a dump it was . But at least it was real : a real honest-to-God place to fight , to get away from , not to let it get you under . . . . Oh , Anthony , you 've picked a very stupid and self-willed young woman . . . . I hope you wo n't be sorry . . . . Even in my happiness tonight and even in my sorrow over him I do blame Dad for what he did to me that fall when I came back from Europe . I was thinking of that this afternoon when I told him that he 'd let me down so often . I tried to tell him why Europe had n't meant so much to me . He closed himself to me ; it was just as though he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any light come through . He talked conventional stuff like my not appreciating my opportunities ; if he had had them at my age ; he had n't even had time or chance to read the books he wanted to read ; what was I going to do with my life . " College was nop149good and travel was no good . Most girls would give their eye-teeth . . . " And so on , and so on . . . . He knew better all the time . But he would n't let on . . . . Of course in a way it makes no sense to blame anyone for anything . You could have reacted differently to the forces about you and you would have done so if you had been different  --  you ! That 's still the decisive thing . You ca n't change the forces ; they 're outside of you ; you ought to be able to control yourself . . . . Fine talk and true enough . And I have known that for a very long time and therefore I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do and if Anthony and I are allowed to live , to be together for just a few years  --  just a few  --  I wo n't say that I ever had anything to complainof or ever ran into any bad luck . . . what one is tempted to call bad luck . . . . All the past will be justifiedby having been the road , however rough and ugly here and there , to this goal . . . . Just the same I had no one but Dad that fall and he failed me . So I said I wanted to study acting and would he let me go to Boston to the Academy of Dramatic Arts there . He grumbled a little but he said : All right . He had a tremendous notion of how wonderfully I 'd acted in school plays and once in a municipal pageant . I did n't thing so very highly of all that myself . But I knew that I had enough aptitude not to seem foolish at the Academy . And I could n't stay home . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of breathing ; no way of learning anything . Mother sweet but indifferent ; Dad imprisoned within himself ; Gilbert and even Harry Bentz gnawing , so to speak , at the threshold . . . . It is n't easy for a girl to account for things even to herself . How about men ? They ought to have straighter ways ; their instincts are so much more direct , at least when they 're in action . Do n't know . Do n't know . I 've been married twice and I feel funnily innocent and untouched . . . . Buck regarded love  --  what a word for it  --  as part of a tear , a bender ; being married simply meant to him going on a bender with the same girl instead of with different girls . John regarded the same thing as an occasional pleasure or convenience or sedative  --  providedthere was n't anything more important in view . Men trying to " make " you more or less casually get so sore when they do n't succeed that you 're tempted to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of sex-pride in them and that they care a whole lot more about having had you than about the actual fact of having you . . . . I know that Anthony and I will have a total togetherness : it will be all of him and all of me . He will give me his whole self  --  all the loveliness in him  --  and I 'll receive that whole self into myself . Yes , I know , I know . . . . Anyhow , Boston was the beginning of things for me  --  the beginning of learning life . At first there was a great lift in it ; later it was n't a bit gay . Wonderful to be free in my studio room on Charles Street and stroll to Beacon and the Common and poke around in the bookshops . My own key . My own hours . Oh , intoxicating ! I seemed like a winged creature . . . . But that lasted actually only as long as I was alone . Pretty soon the kids from the Academy began to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them were pretty vain and artificial . I did like some of the girls , especially Rosaleen , of course . There was always something sturdy about Rosaleen . She did n't lose grip whatever she did . The boys were cute enough . But most of them were fairies . Just the same I began to tingle . Oh , not that I had n't before . But in a pleasantP151way without any urgency . Now there was so much talk and so much , I ca n't call it anything but fornication all over the place  --  maybe a bit more talk than fact . I never really knew . . . . And I was n't a prude and I was too ignorant to be scared , too  --  oh , too sure that if anything was right it would be right all through , beyond conventionand even  --  well , let 's say  --  biology . But there seemed nothing that was even near right . . . . I can remember my room at one o'clock in the morning with empty bottles and filthy glasses full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so desolate with the reek of drinking and petting and necking . . . . I wanted to flee into the night . . . . Not because I sat in judgment . I was actuallytoo shy and self-distrustful to do that . And I also hoped , like an idiot , that some great bloom would one fine day burst suddenly from the muck . . . It did n't , needless to say . I can laugh at myself now for getting up almost every morning with that hope . . . . And then , then  --  I 've thought it over so often  --  Buck had to turn up . I 'd known his sister Peggy at Smith . Poor girl , she was so fat she was afraid to eat anything and given to crushes on females and so had one on me . She wrote me long dull sentimental letters . I answered them , too . She sent Buck right after he 'd got his job in Boston . And after the kids from the academy Buck seemed sort of splendid  --  so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brothers right in the deep middle of the depression and custom-made shirts and gay talk and what teeth ! I was ' so fed up with a slight film of grime and arty talk which  --  something told me  --  had nothing to do with art . . . . No , I do n't think I 'm so much to be blamed . . . . Anyhow , what 's blame ? What does it mean ? We do the best we can . . . . Buck rushed me like mad . He drank a lot , too . More than the kids in fact . But he was in tails and silk-hat and bore up marvelously and was full of energy and laughter from dinner at the Copley-Plaza through a dance and two night-clubs and took me in his arms and carried me up two flights of stairs to my room on Charles Street at three o'clock in the morning . . . . Odd enough , maybe . But I was taut and strained and almost deliberately , almost  --  it seems to me  --  decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of all this eternal talk and tension was like . So , one of those nights after he 'd carried me up , I let him come in , which I had n't done before , and let him make love to me . . . . It was more promise than fulfillment that first time . But I 'd heard that it was , of course . I felt terribly grown up and brave and wise and superior , too , in a way . I sort of giggled at the old tales of the seduced maiden and the broken blossom , at faint memories of a performance of Hazel Kirke or was it The Old Homestead ? . . . And I 'd seen a burlesque of it in vaudeville in which the tottering , white-haired father says : " You ai n't done nothin ' , but it 's snowin ' and out you go . . . " I felt myself mistress of the situation and of myself . This  --  and that was the advantage  --  obligated me to nothing as , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Buck , I thanked my stars , had n't even said he loved me . But I had n't reckoned with Buck nor with the variety of human motives . . . . He sent gorgeous flowers ; he telephoned ; he came and was sentimental . He asked me when we were going to announce our engagement . I teased and hedged . But gradually a selfdistrustcame over me and I became more and more entangled in the physical relationship . It 's such a mysteriousthing . . . . Anthony was the first human beingP153who ever said that to me . . . . All other people either ignored or defiled it . . . . I liked Buck physically in those early days ; I did n't dislike him in any way ; yet more and more when it was all over I felt desolate , oh , so desolate and so desperate and the funny , foolish , atavistic(Anthony 's word ! ) notion came over me that it was because I was living in sin . . . . So I let Buck introduceme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself and when one night , a little more drunk than usual , Buck who , as I found out by and by , could n't keep a thing to himself , but haij to brag  --  when that night in that cute Italian restaurant behind the Statler he said that he 'd looked up Dad 's rating in Dun and Bradstreet  --  why , by that time things were so tangled up and I was so confused and enmeshed that I was helpless . . . . He went to New York and . met Dad accidentallyon purpose and what he told Dad I do n't know and I 've never asked nor ever will . But he was capable of having hinted to Dad that we 'd better get married . . . . When I think of that angle I 'm still humiliated and ashamed . That 's how my grand experiment in freedomended  --  in a ghastly church wedding and an apartment in Brookline . . . . I have n't told Anthony the details . I may when we 're married . No , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staunch as he is , he winces inwardly whenever there arises the faintest indication of the fact that I have had physical relations with any other man . He knows it ; he accepts it ; he does really and truly accept me as I am and would n't have me different . He understands without having to have everything explained to him all that has happened to me and loves me not , oh , thank goodness , not in spite of it , but with , through , all around it . He 's  --  let me think this out  --  yes  --  he 's so aware of my value and rights as a human being , not just a female creature , that he bends over backward sometimes and raises questions that must , as he well knows , lead at least to the tacit acknowledgment of the facts that make him suffer . But he does suffer . . . . I suppose it 's again what he calls atavistic . . . . A remnant of old attitudes now grown ignoble . . . . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell him details . . . . But I 'll tell him one thing I have n't told him yet which should be some comfort to him  --  that I 'm no better than he ; that I 'm worse , much worse , that I 'm fiercely and possessively jealous of his past . And he 's so attractive and he 's fortytwoand he must have had a whole lot more past than he 's ever even let on , and I could tear the hair of every hussy he 's ever touched . So I could . Because he 's my man , exclusively and forever mine and I 'm his woman and I 'll be virgin for him in every sense but a silly one . . . . What did they use to teach us in Sunday School ? Man is fearfully and wonderfully made . He certainly is . . . . I want to be worthy of Anthony 's dignity of mind . But I hope just the same that he wo n't have any pictures or mementos hanging around . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor Buck . The little bit of glamor faded soon enough . I did n't even like his beautiful teeth any more . He had n't a thing to say for himself about anything that mattered . He had wasted his whole ammunition of amusing stories and brilliant gaiety on the " rushing " period . When we settled down in Brookline he did n't feel obligated to amuse me any more and he was just another insurance salesmanand people forgot , of course , that he 'd ever been a football hero and had had his picture in the magazines and nobody made a fuss over him any more and he got morose and pettish and even actively ill-tempered. 1P155have the image of him slouching around in a ten-yearolddressing-gown in what he called his den  --  a horrible little hole filled with college banners and football trophies . Oh , I felt sorry for him enough . It must be plenty hard to be a hero for eighteen months and then be nobody and know that you really are a nobody and are going to be a nobody for life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more . . . . Awful . . . . His sufferingmade me suffer . But also his unashamed humiliation , his hugging his humiliation , made me dreadfully ashamed for him . I even understood his drinking harder and harder under these circumstances , but I could n't help being disgusted , too . Oh , so deeply disgusted . . . . And he insisted on giving parties and that was all right . But he would n't have anybody that had a ghost of a brain in his head . Only his old rah-rah friends from Amherst who could talk about his great days , and their wives . And , of course , nobody would come who had made anything of himself in the world just to revive Buck 's sense of self-importance for him . Oh , what a crew , especially the women . . . . Those parties were just raw and made me think of how really delicate by comparison the kids from the Academy had been , how sensitive and bright and well-mannered , especially the fairies . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not Dad who loves me , not the aunts who hate me . Mother , I almost think , caught a glimpse of it . But I did try just the same to be a good wife to Buck . Money got tighter and tighter with him and I cooked and scrubbed . I let the maid go to save her wages and pretended that two people in a four-room apartment with all modern conveniencesdid n't need a maid . And I got gaunt and sick . My bones stuck out ; you could have studiedP156anatomy by just looking at me . And goodness knows that even the little pagan excitement that had been between us was stone-dead and I did n't want him any more . But he did n't have to say that in the first place I was a dud and he wondered he had n't always seen it and that anyhow his heart was acting funny and he 'd sleep on the davenport in the den thereafter . I thought it over as clearly as I could . He 'd be so much better off without me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making and could have some good clothes again and buy better liquor . Maybe he could " make " a girl or two and that would buck him up and give him some self-esteem . I suspected he was doing that anyhow but in a sheepish hangdog sort of way that took all the good out of it for him . So I told him the conclusions I 'd come to and walked out . . . . Good thing I had Rosaleento go to . . . . Because all I had was a dollar and eighteen cents . . . . Was that so funny ? I thought it funny then and laughed . . . . Not so sure now . . . . Why did n't I go home ? Why could n't I go home ? That 's the one point I do want to discuss with Anthony some day . He 's an anthropologist ; he should know something . Why did Buck act aggrieved ? Why was Dad cold and even more secretive than usual ? Lord ! They act as if there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There may be , of course . There must be oftener than you 'd think from watching people . . . . But when there is n't , there is n't . I was no good to Buck ; he was no good to me . I honestly did n't wish him any hard luck ; I wished him well . But he seemed to be full of resentmentand bitterness . Oh , people are peculiar . Or am  --  1 peculiar ? . . . As for Dad , he was furious in a quiet way . Why ? If people love you ought they not to want you to be happy or , at least , not more unhappy than youp157have to be ? I deliberately did n't tell Dad that I suspectedBuck of unfaithfulness . That might have softenedhim . It 's a legal cause for divorce . My saying that would under the circumstances have been a lie . That was n't the reason I left . The reason was that I did n't love Buck , that his unfaithfulness was indifferent to me  --  in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that deserved any mutual faith . . . . Well , of course , Anthony did say one day about another matter that people live by rubber-stamp concepts in order to keep out the possibility of original action and the terrors of original action . Do n't quite get it . Or , at least , that is n't enough  --  does n't reach fai enough down into the darkness . . . . Breaking with Buck was n't sad in the least . But not being able to go home and Dad withdrawing himself from me for no reason that I could possibly understand and do n't to this day  --  that was sad and cruel and wicked and desperate . I did kind of fall apart after the first sense of having done the right and even kind and decent thing in spite of everybody faded . Rosaleen tried to explainthings and console me . She has a kind of rough and ready wisdom that 's not so shallow when you come to think about it . How gorgeous she was in those days . . . . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what eyes and hair and teeth and also dimples . . . . I can see her sitting on her chaise longue ( it made her feel such a lady ) in her sea-green dressing gown and admiring her own legs . . . . I can see her . I can hear her : " Listen , kid . Buck is peeved because he knows damned well how far above him you are in every way . Tormenting and humiliating their betters is a favorite indoor sport of that kind of cheap male . Raising hell with you and seeingyou suffer was really the grandest thing he had in his lousy life . Of course he 'd put it on the ground that matrimony is a holy estate . They all do . It 's a laugh . But I would n't give him another thought if I was in your place . " " How about my dad ? " I asked her . She shook her head . " That 's something else again , " she said . Then she laughed . " Oh , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't I let it go at that ? I urged her to say what she thought and promised not to be offended . So she said : " Parents want you to stay put and not set them a bad example . " . . . How sad that is , how boundlesslysad . Of course , as soon as she said it I knew that I 'd always known all she meant and all she implied and had n't quite wanted to face it . So I did n't answer her and she was really fond of me and tears came into her eyes as she watched me . " Kid , " she said , " you do n't have to worry . Why do n't you get yourself a job on the stage ? You 've got gobs of talent . Do n't think I do n't know it . More than me or any of the kids . In fact , I have n't any . I 'm just so damned good to look at and to letch after that they always hire me . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a job on your merits . He may want to sleep with you , too . But he 's too clever a businessman to press the point at the risk of your running out on him if he thinks he can really use you . " . . . I do hope Dad is n't awake and tormenting himself . He was n't very kind to me then . He started at me again in that silly stern parent way this afternoon  --  the way that does n't make a bit of sense . Not a bit . Yet my heart always aches for him . He did n't start out to be that way . He does n't really and truly mean to be that way . . . . He knows better , too . . . . It 's his life that has pressed him into a crooked shape . . . . Dear Rosaleen ! How her good earthiness and clearnesshelped me . Ca n't imagine what I would have donep159without her . . . . I wonder how Anthony will view my friendship with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of all the fancy stuff and the foolishness and is Mrs. CaptainO'Sullivan , nee Rose Dooley  --  just like that  --  of the New York Police Force and has Francis Xavier , Jr. , and Michael and Christopher and little Rosemary and weighs  --  ye gods , that girl must weigh a hundred and eighty pounds . Oh , Anthony , will understand . . . . BecauseRosaleen ( I 'm the only one who calls her that now ) still has her earthy wisdom and her honest tongue . . . . When I was nearly frantic wondering what to do about John , did n't she say : " Kid , all he cares about is to have a gilded cage to show ; any other boid ' will do as well as you and maybe a damn sight better . . . . I 'll never forget our apartment  --  it was really just Rosaleen 's to begin with  --  in old Chelsea in New York . . . . I seem to remember just red brick and broken dark-green bottles on the outside . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed and a sort of a couch and some chairs , mostly shaky , and a hot plate . I did n't care much about food . But Rosaleen had to eat . She could n't let herself get thin . Her beautiful rosy flesh  --  not too much but enough  --  was her capital . I guess we drank a lot of milk and that was good for us . Because I began to pick up , too . And , of course , men  --  goodness , Rosaleen seemed to know hundreds  --  took us out to dinner . They were n't particularly fresh with me ; they never felt quite at ease with me and yet they did n't mind being seen with me . That was Rosaleen 's explanation . She used to sort of look me over and say : ' Are n't you a kind of a wisp and a grande dame , too ? How 'd you get that way ? Did n't you tell me your folks were just New England farmers same 's mine were Irish , maybe from the wrong side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her about Grand- father Green and his trotting horses and Mom 's finishing school and things . But I could n't help saying that I 'd bet that in every sense that counted Dad was a much finer gentleman than ever Grandfather Green had been in spite of the genuine cologne from Cologne that he had to have on his huge silk handkerchiefs . . . . I think it was that time that Rosaleen made the remark which first showed me the streak of something that 's half mysticismand half superstition in her and that makes her such a fine wife for Captain O'Sullivan . " Sure , " she said . " In the end ' t is nothing matters but the grace of God . . . " I must tell Anthony about that . I have a hunch that , in his own special way , he 'd consider that a very philosophical observation . . . . Catching myself using his phrasing again . . . . So amusing and so cozy . . . . Ugh , how I trotted about the pavements of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from people in the profession . How I waited in waiting-rooms of managers and casting directors ... . Once I even got to the Guild offices and a pale bald gentleman who must once have been red-haired peered around and said to me in a sort of falsetto with a British accent : " You 're a type we might well use some day . Leave your name and address . But in the meantime I would advise you to go home . This is really not the best way for a young woman to spend her time . " Rosaleen screamed with laughter at that . " Leave it to Phil Moeller to know a lady when he sees one . . . . " Funny . I did land a job . " Second nurse . " Not much . But in a fairly good play . There was a " first nurse " and she had to be stout and competent ; so the second nurse was cast thin and young and spiritual-looking . That'sP161what they said . I certainly looked " spiritual " in the nurse 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more . . . . Oh , I 'm so glad that 's over . . . . I 'm so glad so much is over . . . . It was n't bad . They were all quite fine people . I got enough pay to live on and the play ran for nearly a year . It would have been swell for a girl who really wanted to be an actress  --  an awfully good beginning . But I did n't want to be an actress . I 'd really known that all the time . Often and often I asked myself what I did want . . . . Oh , those walks I used to take from our apartment all by myself westward across Ninth Avenue and Tenth over to the waterfront and watch rough people there who probably lived rather violent lives . I did n't exactly envy their roughness and their violence . I think I did envy their being up against something terribly real and terribly rending . Not that I wanted to be a beer-runner 's woman . . . but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , grief and anguish , but for the sake of something utterly clear , something you could n't doubt a moment , something , someone , to command utter loyalty , wholeness . . . . Oh , I do n't know exactly . A thousand times I tried to put it into some words when I felt so second-rate and worthless . . . . One day Anthony was telling me about an English essayist he 's fond of who said he " wrote for truth not triumph . . . " Wish I 'd known about that then in those days when I wandered around Ninth Avenueand around the waterfront . It comes somewhere near to expressing a feeling I had about what I wanted from life . . . . I remember coming home that summer when the play closed . Dad had asked me not to tell about my being on the stage . Do n't see why to this day . The part and everything were respectable  --  almost stuffy . I was so tired and so glad to come . But there was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . . . . Gilbert thought his chance had come at last . And from his angle I did n't blame him . But his angle was so hopeless . I told him I was n't a " nice " girl and would n't ever be and did n't want what " nice " girls wanted  --  a big home and a social position in my home town . Anything but that . . . . Maybe I ought to have gone a bit further and told him that my chief reason for not for a moment ever considering him seriously was just my regard for him and Dad and Mother and everybody . I would n't ever have had the heart to break with him and so I would have been broken . And seeing I never loved him but just liked him better than the other boys , what would have been the sense ? But when people go in for wishful talking and wishful thinking they do n't expect life to make sense . They do n't at any time , in fact  --  do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been one of my troubles : I did want life to make sense . . . . Poor Gilbert . I really felt sorrier for him that summer than ever . He had n't married ; he has n't yet . He got a final blow yesterday . . . . And I wo n't , as I said , worry about him . . . . But I suppose such devotion is rare and it is tragic that it has n't , from the nature of things or I 'd better say , on account of my own nature , ever meant anything to me . . . . Oh , it was desperate going back to New York that late summer  --  so empty and so dark . No place to stay for me nor any place I wanted to go to . . . . It does me good to think about that here tonight when I 'm safe and at home in the world at last . I felt so homeless then . And what happened to me in New York was about the worst thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I 'd been working sent me to a chap who was casting a play to go on the road and needed my type ( or what he thought my type ) and gave me a lob straight off and three weeks later I was on the road with the company ... . I suppose one reason I had such a very bad time was that I had n't really the physical strength for such a life . Of course , a couple of the women were war-horses . But there were also a couple of girls in the company no older and no stronger looking than I. And they did n't seem to mind so much . . . . But the Pullmans and the hotels and the empty smelly theaters and the crowds beyond the footlights got to be a kind of evil phantasmagoria  --  urn-hum , that 's the word  --  evil and somehow menacing in a sordid kind of way . Yes , sordid , though we stayed at good hotels , at very good ones in the big towns  --  Cleveland , for instance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's right ; I remember the Park-Plaza there . Very pretty . Be lovely to stay there  --  if you could stay and wonderful if you were n't alone but with someone you loved . And the Schenley in Pittsburgh was n't bad and we took a dip South and I have the image of the lovely , lovely garden behind the Biltmore in Atlanta . . . . I had just ten minutes in it . . . . But oh , we plunged about in the Middle West on one-night stands  --  towns , towns , towns , all alike , or they seemed alike and so many hotels really smelly , though they were clean , I suppose , and I did n't really know the names of the towns and did n't want to know them any more and packed and unpacked and got too worn out to take baths even . . . . And caught colds  --  everybody did from time to time in the draughty theaters  --  oh , those draughts from the wings on an empty stage  --  they seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Suppose it was because I was feverish with a cold . But I 'll never forget Decatur , Illinois . . . . Dirty snow and horrible houses and vicious looking posters on fences and a miserable coffee-shop full of depressed-looking people and a sky like dirty linen and not even a bare tree . And Grady , the comic lead , a good enough fellow who managed to live by never letting himself quite sober up and sort of defensivelypretended to himself that he was interested in sights and the state of the country  --  well , Grady burst into my room and asked if I did n't want to go and see the chief sight of the town which , he said , was a factory where they produced all sorts of fascinating by-products of corn and where  --  he could visibly wag his ears like a mule and did at that moment  --  where they had copper cuspidors in the offices of the executives with Cupids and garlands hammered in relief on the copper . I must have been half out of my mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let Grady give me a drink and another out of his hip-flask and hardly noticed it when he began pawing me . . . . But suddenly he quit and said : " Kid , you 've got a fever . Lemme call the hotel doctor .. . " And he rushed down and did . And the doctor gave me some capsules which did help or , at least , brought the temperature down ... . I must tell Anthony about that some day in more detail than I have yet . It 'll help me to make it clearer in my own mind and so , maybe , to get rid of it . Because that was a bad , bad time for me and it still comes back to me in nightmares . . . . I was so tired , oh , so tired and life was so hurried and higgledy-piggledy and so joyless  --  yes , joyless as one of those middle-western smallish-town Main Streets on a winter afternoon . . . . It was the same for everybody , of course . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just do n't . You never never can tell how it looks and feels inside of other people . You can stretch your imagination till it seems to snap like a rubber band . Does no good ... . There was Genevieve Holt , our lead , who got a hundred and fifty bucks a week and had been more on the road than anywhere else for twenty years  --  since she was eighteen or nineteen . And she 'd been in all those towns a hundred times and still called up the papers and was interviewed and clipped the interviews and raised the very devil if the notices of the performances were n't mailed to her so she could clip them too . And if we stayed more than a day she hauled out all her photographs in all her roles and plastered the place with them and looked at them and just purred at the notion of what a great and famous actress she was . It was so funny . She made the director cut two lines of mine because , according to her , they took away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she took it for granted that I 'd hate her and when she found out I did n't give a darn she sort of took to mothering me on the principle that I was just a poor lost sheep who 'd never make an actress . And in her own way she was right . . . And that was n't the worst . . . . The worst was that I did n't hear the cry of my soul any more  --  the cry after what was mine somewhere in the world  --  the cry that I must n't do with less or worse than that , though I did n't know what it was and only knew that I would know it and would recognize it if ever it was given me to see it face to face . . . . The cry was killed  --  I can see it now  --  I 've seen it for a long time  --  by the suppers after the snow . How was that exactly ? . . . Do n't care if I do n't sleep much tonight . Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever did before and Anthony is taking care of me from now on . . . and I of him ... . There was always a sense of hurry and strain on the road  --  always : train , hotel , settling  --  what a word for what we did  --  rehearsal or matinee  --  trying so hard to relax that I , at least , quivered like a tormented telephonewire . Then the evening performance and at last , at last , a little pause . . . . Usually we did n't have to get up early . So supper after the show was the one time when you could sit down and be almost human . But you were so keyed up and so tired that before you could be human you had to have a drink or two or three or four . . . . And I was n't used to it and yet I craved it more than anyone because I had to relax that one time in the twenty-four hours or I 'd have run shrieking out into the streets  --  because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapped . Oh yes , they would . . . . And then we 'd eat and drink some more drinks and at last relax and grow dim and soft , very dim and not giving a damn and seeing death and almost wishing for it and at least twice , I did n't know just how , I got to bed and knew pretty certainly next morning that I had n't been in bed alone .... I 've always been grateful that it was near the end of the season . I stopped drinking  --  just quit cold  --  and when the curse came and I knew I was safe at least physically I collapsed and had hysterics for practically the only time in my life ... . I 'm not a crying girl , Anthony . I can take a lot of things on the chin and give no trouble . . . . I do n't believe Dad ever let on to anyone that I was on the road that season . Do n't know why . It was a perfectlyrespectable thing , was n't it ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll never forget that . Never . . . . I 'd saved a little dough too andP167Rosaleen had an apartment on Riverside Drive now that I could share and Dad came down and he and I had dinner together and went to a show together and he asked me why I did n't come home . But he did n't press me ; I thought he acted awfully queer . He offered me a roll of bills and on a funny sudden impulse I told him I had plenty of money . So off he went in his most gentlemanly way and left me terribly sick at heart and feeling more homeless than ever . I told Rosaleen I 'd never go on the road again ; I did n't have the strength . She was making $175 a week in a musical show , though she was tone-deaf and had no voice but with most of her clothes off she was worth that and more to any manager . And , of course , rich men made her fabulous propositions and she turned them down not because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wanted a husband and babies and a house on Staten Island . Why Staten Island I never could find out . . . . She 'd once been there on an excursion when she was a kid and it stuck in her mind  --  a section , it seems , where there are hills , little hills , from which you can see all kinds of waters and New York , too ... . I 'm so glad she has the man and the babies , dear Rosaleen , and from what she tells me they 're getting the house on Staten Island now . I envied her so for knowing what she wanted and called myself all kinds of a fool . But that was only because the old cry in my heart had n't come to life again . . . . I trotted about trying to get a job on Broadway , any kind of a little . part . But fate is so queer . .. . I had just had beginner 's luck that first time . Now I had what it takes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get a nibble even  --  not one little one . Weeks passed , months passed . . . . Rosaleen did n't know my money had given out . Dad came down and did n't offer me any money because I 'd turned him down that other time . It was n't a bit funny . I hocked one of Grandmother Green 's diamond rings which Mom had once given me and which I 'd never worn ; I hocked a gold necklace somebody had talked me into buying in Paris . I held my head high , too . But it was n't funny . . . oh , not a little bit . . . and the worst of it , the very very worst that I ca n't get over is the mean little suspicion that I married John Stewart for security ... . But did I ? Or was it a different kind of discouragement ? Because I could have asked Dad for money . I could just have gone home . . . . Was n't it most because I 'd reached a dead end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old pride , for all I pretended to hold my head so high , was broken ? . . . Oh , how I had listenedeverywhere in other years for a voice , for a word , for the voice and word that would set me free and give me a chance to live beautifully and gaily and gallantly ? I do n't mean without suffering . No , nor withouttrouble  --  but in a way that was worth suffering and bearing trouble for . . . . ' Well , that seemed all over and I felt beaten and vague and just uncomfortable and even ill very often . I suppose the plain fact is that when you 've got a feeling as if your father and your mother have abandoned you  --  they had n't , of course  --  and when you do n't always get enough to eat and walk till you 're sore in every joint to save subway fare , why , then what Anthony calls the higher operations of the mind have n't much chance to function . . . . And John is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swell case for our getting married . . . . He looked good to me the first time Rosaleen 's friend Walt Smith brought him to see us .... Never did knowp169what Rosaleen 's relations to Walt were . . . did n't care particularly . . . . He was frightfully fond of her and good-looking and had wads of money . I know she liked him very well . But because he was an engineer and quite a big man in his profession she treated him contemptuously because she felt inferior to him , felt almost illiterate in his presence , and Walt  --  who tried to confide in me once  --  could n't bear to reduce her to the status of a kept woman and was afraid to marry her because whenever he was around she acted and seemed more illiterate than she was . . . . So I never really knew how far they got with each other , because on strictly personal matters Rosaleen always had far more delicacythan you 'd give her credit for with her wagging Irish tongue . . . . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring him over . . . . John 's a formal kind of person . I do n't as a rule like that . But I can see more and more how at that particular moment with the things that had happened to me I liked that very much . I felt very desperate and had hours in which I felt as though I 'd been violated and exposed and somehow beaten . And John Stewart whose firm did a lot of business with banks in Northern New England and who 'd actually been in Greenfield to confer with Gilbert 's father and the Directors of the Lamoyle Trust Company  --  well , to him I was n't a raggletagglebob-tailed actress . I was Miss Munson . . . . It is so funny and so sad to think of . . . . It did buck me up at that moment just the same . The last thing that normally would hive interested me .. .. I 'm ashamed of it to this day  --  to this hour . . . . I never before wanted to be a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . John was amusing , too , in his heavyish way . But I liked his solidityand good manners . He did n't make passes at me .   We dined at quiet good places and went to the plays I wanted to see and even once in a while took walks together . He told me all about himself  --  or , at least , what people call and think all . . . . He 'd been divorced a couple of years ago , after a marriage of fifteen years . He had n't any bitter feeling against his former wife who had simply been a restless neurotic sort of woman who ought probably to have had children and ran for years from gynecologist to gynecologist trying to find out why she could n't have any and could n't make up her mind to have them even if she could and then unexpectedly had a Fallopian pregnancy and nearly died and then got more neurotic than ever . . . . She kept herself and himself in a constant stew and did n't a bit mind retiring on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent adherent of Aimee Semple MacPherson . . . . I dare say it was all true . . . . John 's a perfectly honorable and truthful sort of person . He was pleased when I told him I 'd been married before and gave him as honest an account of Buck and me as I could . He said that at his age of forty-three he did n't think he 'd want to marry an inexperienced girl ; he did n't , he said , have much in the way of romance to offer . Maybe , he admitted , he 'd never been a romantic person and that might have had something to do with his wife 's unhappiness . He did n't honestly think so but he did think it only fair to give her the benefit of that doubt . Anyhow , he admired me more than any woman he 'd ever seen or known and he 'd be ever so happy and ever so honored  --  yes , goodness , he said just that  --  if I 'd marry him . I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He explained in a sober way how well off he was and when I stopped him he said I wasn'tP171to be silly ; it meant a . great deal to happiness to be able to be comfortable and free of material care . He had n't always been by any means . He 'd just had good breaks , even during the depression , and now he was member of a firm that had a seat on the Stock Exchange and he could offer me every reasonable comfort and even luxury . I pretended even to myself that I did n't care and just the same I lapped it up and saw myself a lady with an establishment and Fifth Avenue charge accounts . . . . Oh , dear wild pines  --  I did n't even see you then ! I had almost forgotten that there had ever been that crying out in my soul after what was really truly mine . I was scared and wanted to be safe  --  just safe . . . . I was scared to the bone of what kind of a life I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and could n't bear to go home without something to conciliate . . . something to justify myself . . . . So it occurred to me one day , quite suddenly , that being engaged to a gentleman of obviously the highest respectability and considerable wealth and unexceptionable standing  --  Harvard graduate , even Phi Beta Kappa  --  how did John ever get it ?  --  would sort of soothe Dad and Mother and even the aunts . And then I imagined it all , how it would be at home with this announcement and went through those anticipated scenes and somehow lost sight of all the realities I 'd have to face and kidded myself into believingthat I liked John a goad deal more than I did . That , in turn , sort of fired him and spurred him on  --  he 's fine in his way and sensed it  --  and he really was rather delightful in his serious stodgy way . . . . Come to think of it all tonight I see so clearly why Anthony is so very shy of people . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he says that people impinge and obscure ; they divide and darken the soul . They do n't mean to . But they do . And when they themselves are obviously runners in crowds , then they are afraid or ashamed to face themselves and want their souls to be still further divided and darkened . ... That 's what happened to me . . . . Always my life seems to have been cluttered with people and never with tranquil or happy people or people who faced their troubles in a clear way so that I might have learned something from them . No , never . . . . Always there was some malice or some furtiveness . . . . Always that impingement and division . . . . And though Rosaleenwas so good and so warm-hearted  --  there she was and there were her friends and I saw a vision of myself  --  if I married John  --  of being alone most of the time in a lovely spacious place ; and I had a picture of myself taking walks and facing the sky once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where I 'd be maybe the only customer and there would be not even the sound of gabble oT the clatter of dishes . . . . Yes  --  what a joke  --  I married John to be alone and cool ... . I ought to have had sense enough to know that my calculations were n't so accurate when I got home . Mama thought it was all very nice . But she 's never emphaticenough to suit me . The aunts  --  why should I have bothered to think of them ? Just a bad habit and hangover from childhood . Well , they were kind of wry and funny . Said they hoped it would turn out well and that John was really all I said he was . . . . Dad was pale and did n't say much . . . . I almost flew up at him one day . I did ask him what he wanted . He was n't satisfiedor happy to have me traipsing about ; he did n't want to support me and I did n't want him to awayp173from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home ? So was n't , I asked him  --  I , of all people  --  it was funny  --  was n't a wise marriage the best thing for me ? And now I said that he could look up John Stewart in Dun and Bradstreet . . . . I sank as low as that . . . . But why would n't Dad talk ? All he said was : Had I considered carefully all the circumstances and whether John and I were at all suited to each other , and he did n't think it was for him to make any further comments because I was old and also experienced enough to judge for myself . He was no help and was obviously unhappy and my fine act did n't come off at all ... . All that  --  I can see it tonight as almost never before  --  drove me straight into John Stewart 's arms , so to speak . Because I came back to New York feeling terribly orphaned and forlorn and unprotected and he made a fuss over - me in his gentlemanly way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive ones , and he told me to buy things I wanted for the apartment we decided on on Central Park West near Sixtieth Street . It was all sort of , well , sort of healing . And he had no relations except an older sister , quite a nice woman , a widow of some means who 'd always been more interested in her church work than in anything else and she lived in Westchester then and just entertained us a couple of times . Oh , it all seemed peaceful and good . . . . And it also seemed good that John wanted no fussy wedding but was satisfied to get the license and be married by the mayor who was a friend of the senior member of his firm . . . . Our apartment was ready and he was pretty busy and so we just went to Lake Placid for an extra long weekend . . . . I 've never been able to figure out just what our marriedrelationship was . Do n't often think about it ... .  | Why should I ? . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . . . . But it was strange  --  or at least it was to me . . . . Though , I suppose , it 's common . . . . John seemed to feel that our physical relationship was something that we 'd been sort of condemned to  --  all human beings  --  and that it was ( as Amy , his sister once said ) part of our lower nature , our animal nature and so the nice thing for nice people to do was to get it over with in the dark and not mention it . And at that point I did n't mind because I had n't fallen in love with John and was n't too sorry to get the necessary minimum over with , too . . . though I did think it , well , half ghastly and half comical , that he would n't touch me till the fourth or fifth night just to show me that he did n't marry me for that . But I could see soon enough what might have driven his first wife half-crazy because in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later happenings probably also shared his feeling about love . Well , of course , that made him miss our chance . There was a chance .... I 'd made up my mind I 'd do my very best to make John happy and I thought him then and have always thought him a very agreeable man  --  good-looking , well-groomed , well-bred in every way . But it never occurred to him to woo me at all . He did n't know what it was and if anyone would have explained it to him he would have been horrified .. . actually , I do believe . . . . Oh yes , it must be common and it explains a lot , an awful lot and I must be queer , I suppose , not to have known it before . But maybe the kids of my generation are different in that respect and John was just enough older to have missed all that differenceand agreed in all such matters instinctively with his father who had been an elder in the Presbyterian Church , Fifth Avenue at that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1930 .... It came so clear to me that day when Anthony was poking fun at Saint Paul and said that most people seemed to agree that it was better to marry than to burn , but not a whole lot . . . . I love the way Anthony throws back his head and laughs ... . Afterward he added that they took good care not to have it a whole lot better ... . Oh no , John and I had no chance . . . . He was n't capable of letting us have a chance . Not in any way . Because he was n't even companionable in a mental way . After we got married he did n't talk about feelings or thoughts or life  --  ever  --  not ever  --  just about transactionsand objects  --  about things and public events . He never read a book , just papers and magazines  --  oh , fairly serious ones : Fortune and even , I think , a Journal of Economics and now , after we were married , he bought tickets for farces and musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a hard week he wanted to relax and be amused and drop his worries over what the country was coming to under this administration . ... I hardly knew when I married him that he 'd gone to the Harvard School of Business Administration . I 'm so ignorant that when I think of Harvard I think only of some beautiful , beautiful little essays by Professor George Santayana and of Professor Baker 's workshop that the kids in Boston used to talk about . John had n't heard of Santayana and he said that it was common knowledge that Baker 's students were all more or less nuts . . . . Did I even enjoy the apartment and being alone in it ? A little bit at first .... I did take a few walks and go to a little tearoom . . . . But , of course , John wanted to entertain and show his new wife and I did n't blame him for that and did try to throw myself into it . Oh ,   I really did . . . . I even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no friends I could ask . Rosaleen flatly refused to come except to see just me in the afternoon . And John 's friends . . . John 's friends .... I 'm gratefultonight that I 'll never have to see them again . So grateful . . . . Awfully fine people . Who am I to doubt it ? None of them had ever made a mistake or , if they did , they would n't let on . They had all the virtues . But they had no souls . No , I must n't say that . But they must have been brought up to be so ashamed of having a soul that they 'd deliberately forgotten ever having had one . Because , if that was n't so , they must once in a while have sort of blundered into saying something about thoughts or feelings that were their very own and they would n't have been so scared of any book or play or anything that could have pierced to where their feelings were . They talked politics in a mechanical querulous way and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had bought or would buy and about cards and golf and what their children liked or did n't like to do and eat and wear and servants . . . . And they told stories  --  I mean , the men , of course  --  and many of the stories were dirty stories . . . . I told Anthony about that on one of our earliest days . He said : Yes , it was most pitiful that to so and so many respectable people in the world the only contact left with the deepest and most sacred thing in life was through the dirty story . . . . Why do I go over all that again ? Oh , I suppose to be conscious of my release and to hug my happiness to my breast . Maybe I should n't . . . . But I have n't had much to hug . . . . I used to be so glad when they played bridge . It was a relief after the talk . I made a point of learning to play a good game and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though I was ever so careful , that I was n't their kind . The men would kid me and kid John a little . In a weak moment he 'd told them I 'd been on the stage . That seems so funny now . . . . " How 's the actress ? " " You 'd better look out , John . Artists are temperamental , you know . " " Know the story of the businessman who married an opera singer ? Well , it seems that this singer . . . " The fools . . . the fools . . . . Oh , and it did make me mad that Dad was impressed by what seemed their solidity and their good clothes and stuff like - that . Of course , they did n't tell their stories or clack their cheap jokes the few times he was there at a party . I 've always loved that about Dad that people just do n't , somehow , in his presence . . . . And yet that , too , put me at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buck and his pals pulled themselves together when Dad turned up ... I did stand up to it all for nearly a whole year . For a whole year John had no fault to find . Oh , it 's so funny that the aunts and Dad , yes , Dad too and maybe even Mother , though she does n't say so , think I 'm so frivolousand light-minded and just changeable . . . . I did try so hard to live that life of loneliness  --  oh , how lonely and desolate it got  --  and of being married and not loved . You could n't call John 's every Friday or every other Friday 's surreptitious embrace love . . . and those dreadful , dreadful people . . . . And I wanted to go on standing it ; I did n't deliberately quit . But my nerves did . I 'd get up in the morning feeling as if my head was clasped in an iron ring that was being squeezed tighter and tighter . . . and I cried for no special reason and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time , I yelled . . . yelled at the maid and at John . . . . Could n't read or think or do anything . . . . Went shopping and did n't want the stuff when it came . . . . Once even took drinks to buck me up for John 's homecoming and then had the bad luck to have them affect me more than any three drinks ever did in life . . . . Seems funny in a way now . But it did n't seem funny then . . . . John got worried , awfully worried . But not about me . About himself . About his peace and comfort and his comfortable routine . I could see it in his eyes and sticking out all over him before one morning at breakfast he burst out : " Just like Lil . ... Jesus , do I always have to pick crazy females ? Just my rotten luck . " . . . I did try to reason with him , did n't I ? Not that minute , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . I was calm and affectionateand did my best . . . . Of course , I was afraid it was hopeless . John was too old to change . Maybe not too old but too frightfully self-opinionated and set in his ways . He would n't even try to see that there was anything wrong for me in our lives . . . would n't even try . . . . Well , of course , he could n't without revising all his notions  --  every one of them  --  and no man wants to do that or can even if he wanted to . . . . He 'd made a lot of money and that was his idea of success in life and since he was successful , why , he could n't imagine that he could be wrong or mistaken about anything . He 'd got to be a success and a big shot , smoking Corona-Coronas and driving a Packard and not caring how many cases of Haig and Haig ( pinch-bottle ) his guests consumed in the course of a season  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex is dirty and Roosevelt a dictator and a crazy man and that only long-haired foreigners , probablyP179with real lice , cared about anything except money and machines and games and comfort . He had . You could n't even deny it . So he was right , was n't he ? And I was a hysterical female , was n't I ? And though he hated the thought of a second divorce and paying a second batch of alimony  --  he was paying Lil $150 a week  --  I could see him sort of turning it over in his mind if it would n't be cheaper and easier in the end ? . . . Oh , after that one outburst he was ever so gentlemanly . . . . " Sorry you do n't adjust yourself better . " " Just as bad for you as for me . " " If there 's anything you want , dear . . . " I could n't act natural with his friends any more . I had to put on an act to stand them . I did that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right ... . But John was n't fool enough not to see through it and that made him nervous and uncertain of himself and made him feel uncomfortable at his own parties . I was sorry about that too ... . We dragged along . That 's all you can say . . . . I went to see Rosaleen who told me not to worry about John but asked me to look before I leaped . She just wanted me to be sure to know what I 'd do with myself . I said I could n't let my soul go crying till I was withered and old for three meals a day and a roof . She said that was all right , but that if you did n't have at least , let 's say , two meals a day and a roof , too , your soul would n't be crying out for its desires very long either . " So , " she said , " it 's tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee . Be realistic ! " She grinned at herself for using the word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and keep looking for the right man . " I told her I saw her point and it was a good one and I was inclined to envy a girl that could take her advice , only I was n't the girl . She laughed and said she knew it ... .   Then John early last spring had his bright idea ... . Oh , how bright for both of us , oh , how wonderful for both of us . . . . He said he had to go to Boston for a month on business and would I like to come , too . The change would do me good . . . . I can remember the day , the hour , the light . . . . It was at dinner and there were just a few small bulbs lit in wall-sconces and four candles on the table and through the dim room and actually creeping up John 's face there was something like the faintest , faintest flush of dawn .... I 'm a little fey maybe . . . . But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said I 'd love to go . That cheered him . He said he 'd have to do a lot of entertaining  --  men at business conferences evenings and so would I mind if we took two adjoining suites . Mind ! But I was a lady and said : " If that seems best to you . . . " Then I said : " Oh , John , let 's please , please stay at the Bellevue ; I love that neighborhood . " He said he did n't ; he 'd prefer the Ritz or even , Christ , the Statler . . . . But he pulled himself up short and was a gentleman . " Does n't really matter . O.K. I 'll wire the Bellevue . " Then he said , as near grinning as I 've ever seen him , with a sting of irony against me and against himself for having married a creature like me : " We 've got a fellow in our Boston office you 'll like , by the name of Ted Frank . He started out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a sharp not very pleasant laugh  --  " but he got infantile paralysis when he was about nineteen . Walks on crutches . Well , for some reason he switched over to mathematics and I 'll admit he 's a shark . Been of great use to us ; made him a junior partner last year . His statistical graphs are a wonder . But he 's certainly nuts . . . " I laughed , but pleasantly : " Like me ? " John looked at me almost affectionately . HisP181tolerant condescension did him good . " Remember it was you said it , not I . . . " I had n't noticed the spring in a long , long time ... . Seems to me I 'd been sort of buried . . . . But last May in Boston it came all over me . It 's like spring here at home . Well , maybe a little softer  --  not quite so stern and delicate . . . oh , so lovely . . . . The buds on the Common were just bursting and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were already sprinkling the sun-filled streets here and there . I knew somehow that something was going to happen to me that was wonderful .... I felt so young and clean . Funny little stabs seemed to pierce my heart . The shops on Boylston Street seemed to me the brightest I 'd ever seen . But I poked around a lot in the bookshopson Ashburton Place and in all the neighborhood and bought a lot of poetry  --  especially a lovely volume of Elinor Wylie , all her poems  --  I 'd just known scraps before  --  and , oh , you do n't cry over her . Your heart weeps a little but your eyes are brave .... " I was , being human , born alone . I am , being woman , sore beset , I live by squeezing from a stone the little nourishment I get ... " No more ... no more ... . I did n't see much of John and managed somehow to forget about him and when he turned up for dinner I managed to be gay . He 'd really never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the heart , with a sense of freedom , I did n't know how or why . And it made him surly . Are n't people queer ? Yet so easy to understand in some ways . He wanted the change to do me good and yet when it did he had an uncomfortable feeling that it was doing me good because I was free of his environmentand habits and friends and that , again , irri- tated him and he resented it . Not that he wanted me particularly . But so long as I was Mrs. Stewart he wanted me , damn it , to be that exclusively and nothing else and subject to no other influence . And that would n't have been so unjust either if he 'd done anything on his part ever , ever , to make me want to be that . . . . But he thought what he had to offer was so wonderful that only somebody who was " nuts " would find it at all unsatisfactory . And , of course , I was a kind of waif and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really know that and had no right to assume that I 'd be permanently grateful for just a home , like an alley cat ... . Anyhow  --  how I can see it  --  he did bring Ted Frank to dinner and I knew more piercingly than ever that something wondrous was going to happen to me . It was n't Ted . Oh , not because Ted 's poor twisted legs were in iron braces and he dragged himself about on crutches . Oh no . . . . And John 's real coarseness came out that evening . Though he knew me well enough to know that his so-called honor was entirely safe in my keeping as long as I was his wife , he 'd always kept a rather careful eye on me even at his own parties and had been annoyed if I exchanged more than three words with a man , which I rarely did . . . . This evening he left Ted and me almost ostentatiously at about nine , saying he had to see some men and almost smirked with security because his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I will always love him for bringing us together . He saw my whole situation that first night and I knew he saw it , yet neither of us betrayed our knowledge of that knowledge . He simply said how hard it was for him to live in the midst of these men of money and affairs , not because he despised money and affairs as instrumentalities with-P183in such a society as ours , but because all the men had made final ends of these things and despised all toward which these things were to help us  --  art and meditation and dignity . . . . I did n't say much . But he must have seen how I needed to hear what he had to say . Because as a rule Ted is silent , almost too silent and just listens to others with his pale little face leaning slightly toward his left ' shoulder . I said I 'd heard he was a musician and asked if he kept up his music . He said : Would I come up to his apartment for tea next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street just by Arlington and a friend of his was corning too and he 'd promised to play to that friend  --  his oldest friend and his closest  --  on the organ he 'd had built into his apartment . I said all right I 'd come . But this time my intuition failed me because I said to myself later after I 'd gone back to the Bellevue that I 'd rather have heard Ted talk than sit there with somebody else and listen to music ... . Well , maybe that failure in intuition was a sort of protective thing . . . . If I 'd known  --  no , I could n't have known  --  but if I 'd even suspected I might have been too scared to go . As it was I started a bit early  --  it 's not much of a walk from the State House to the corner of Arlington  --  and watched the buds and birds on the Common and was more tranquil and also more light of heart  --  oh , so light  --  than I 'd been in years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaulted roof of Ted 's studio and the gilt organ-pipes with a blue window behind them and Ted 's saying : " This is Anthony Foulk . " . . . I took you all in right away , Anthony , though I could n't have described you then : your nice rough tweed suit and sweater underneath , casual but not a bit athletic , and your head just on a level with mine ; your dark hair with the little tiny streaks of gray curling at the edges , and how your sleepy brown eyes got big and clear and sort of sudden and your nose  --  I love your nose , Anthony , even though you say it 's too big like your French grandmother 's . It has power and sense . And I saw from your mouth right away that you had suffered but would n't mind suffering more if you approved of the reason . You can laugh at me , if you like . . . . But I did see just that . . . that your mind has to approve of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of perception that gave me such a new feeling  --  honestly , Anthony , a new heaven and a new earth and made me feel so strangely safe with you right away . . . safe as I 'd never felt before . . . firm with my feet on earth  --  a good earth to be on  --  and with my head in a skyey , dawnlike place . . . . You did see , you admit , that I had confidence in you , a kind of confidence I 'd never had in any other human being before and that 's why , I do believe you , for a " shy feller , " as you say you are , you were so amazingly fresh with me right there on the spot , and even before we 'd sat down on the davenport together  --  we 're always on davenports , are n't we  --  you asked me what I was doing being Mrs. John Stewart . . . . Ted served tea and I did n't answer you right away and it seems to me we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew we 'd better gain time to catch our breath .... Then Ted explained the device he had had specially made for him so that he could manage the foot manual of the organ without proper feet and asked what he should play . And you said : " Something simple and beautiful . . . " And Ted played a few things that did seem , oh , so warm and so heavenly , so heartfelt and gay and also overwhelm-P185ingly sad but without any gray or any ugliness in their sadness . . . You 've told me since what they were , Anthony  --  a couple of old English madrigals and a Handel gavotte and Mozart and some part of Beethoven 's Sonata Pathetique . . . . And as we sat there listening  --  sat side by side  --  our hearts , Anthony , kept coming closer to each other . . . and I think and you agree that our bodies spoke too in a fine delicatetrembling way because , as you say , the soul is embodied in the body and so the body is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped and got hold of his crutches and climbed down from his tall seat and asked you was that all right . And you said : More than . You turned to me and wanted to know if I agreed . And before I knew it I said that the music reminded me so of the poems of Elinor Wylie I 'd just been reading , though they were so modern . And your eyes sort of burned and you wanted to know precisely why ? And I said that I hardly knew unless it was that all the best things had some deep similarity of mood . Then Ted asked us if we did n't want a Scotch and soda and we said almost in the same breath : " You bet . " And then you said , while he was mixing the drinks , that I had n't answered your question about what was I doing being Mrs. John Stewart . " What do you know about John ? " I asked . And you said : " Only what Ted has told me . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " Then you were fresh , were n't you , Anthony ? You said the individual and his little tricks did n't matter , but that all these men of business and affairs , or nearly all , were overgrown adolescents who were frightfully solemn about second-rate things  --  things that were quite all right and necessary in their place but second-rate and were unbelievably frivolous about everything that was first-rate and of first-rate importance . . . . Had n't I noticed that , you wanted to know . . . . And , of course . I said that though I had n't ever used those words it seemed to me I 'd seen nothing else all my life about everybody I knew except that all  --  all sacrificed their e very lives  --  I was thinking of Dad , too , of course  --  for second-rate things like money or the opinion of fools and tried to pretend that the great things were either trivial or indecent ... . It was pretty swell and self-restrained of us , was n't it , Anthony , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then  --  especially because you must have known that Ted would understand and not mind . In fact we 've been such ladies and gentlemen , because I would have given myself to you unreservedly , body and soul , right there on that first afternoon because I knew  --  and that 's the only reason you have to call me a smart girl  --  I knew that the old cry of my soul had been heard at last and been answered at last and whether I could really have you or not I 'd better have whatever little bit of you I could to remember . . . . Was it the next day or the next or the next on Boston Common under the trees by the little lake that you told me that , since we 'd , thank God , married each other on sight you could indulge your prejudice against even technical adultery and why risk any guilt when you just did n't need to , seeing that society at the end of so many ages had at last reached the wisdom of several ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , I knew you were an anthropologist and had been teaching in California and now had from October on a **27;2861;TOOLONG government job doing actual field and research work in the Southwest ? And was n't it funny how I felt we 'd be ever soP187well off on that , much better off than John could ever be with all his wads and wads of money ? .. . Oh , how the cl , auds are scudding across the stars ... . Wo n't I get any sleep tonight ? . . . It 's better to be kept awake by happiness than by grief or pain , anyhow . . . . We 'll still have something to go through tomorrow . . . . I ca n't hurt Dad too sorely on his birthday . And yet , and yet .. . . when your own has come to you , your very own at last , at last , your first duty is to it ... . What days those were in Boston . . . . You wanted me to tell John right away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that we were going back to New York that afternoon by plane because he must be in his office first thing in the morning . So I phoned and told you , remember ? . . . And two days later  --  because now I had to get away from that tomb of an apartment before one of John 's Friday night impulses  --  I told John I wanted a divorce . Pretty quaint what everybody here thinks about that or . what they think they ought to think out of some self-protective instinct . No , that is n't it either . . . . Not even protecting their selves but the miseries they do n't know , poor things , how to get rid of . . . . And so they talk pulp magazine stuff about broken homes and broken hearts . . . . Of course , John set up a howl at first . He has a strong property instinct even about property he does n't want and gets no good out of and he 'd come to regard me as a piece of property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitch ? Oh , he was a fool who might have known from the way I ditched my first husband that I was an unreliable slut . . . . Phew ! . . . Just as you say , Anthony . Just like an adolescent . Because he did n't love me and never had and I was a nuisance to him and an annoyance . So I let him go on till he was tired . Then he took a drink and , funnily enough , asked me if I wanted one too . I said no thank you very nicely . And then I said it did n't make any difference to him , after all , who the man was that I 'd fallen for or , in fact , whether I 'd fallen for any . He must know that our marriage had long been unsatisfactory to him and so what was the good of going on ? He 'd had a second drink by then and had done a bit of reflecting with calmer nerves . So he said  --  I will tell Dad some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I said . But , he went on , business really was n't what it had been . He was damned afraid we 'd be rushed into this lousy war and everybody taxed out of existence pretty nearly and he was in no position to risk a scandal on top of it all or to pay any kind of alimony  --  oh , a trifle maybe  --  but nothing like what he paid Lil . . . . I could see his mind working . If it cost him very little and gave him no trouble he could see himself living at his club and having a fine time . I did n't let him worry long . I told him there would be no scandal and that I did n't want any alimony and would sign any paper to that effect . " Oh , " he said , " better take twenty bucks a week or so . " He got up and walked up and down . He was arranging the fine quiet time he 'd have in his mind . I said no thank you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think it would be fair or decent to take a cent . Whatever the reason , I had n't made him very happy and so indeed it was for me to thank him for all the money he 'd had to spend on me . He kind of peered at me , Anthony , actually from all sides , as though I were a strange lady he 'd never seen . Then he said : Well , if I meant that it certainly showed a very fine spirit and that he certainly appreciated it when peoplep189were n't just mercenary and that if ever in the future I needed a friend he certainly hoped I would n't forget him .... : - lust tell Dad .... " Certainly , " he said every other minute and . his relief and delight were really pathetic . I do n't blame him . . . . He wanted to be comfortable and middle-aged and not be interfered with ... . Oh , Anthony , you said I was like a bird soaring through a sky at dawn . . . . You 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it was a funny place to say it  --  the lobby of that quaint stuffy little hotel in the forties where you advised me to take a room because you were staying in another even funnier and stuffier little hotel in the next block . It was , was n't it ? But your meaning was exactly right , as it always is . Getting out of that apartment of John 's , leaving all that behind , did make me feel like a creature whose wings had been tied and were now set free . But there was more to it than that . . . . It seemed to me that all my life I 'd been trying to say something , to convey something that was my very own , that had to be said . And no one had ever heard me . Once in a while someoneeven listened or seemed to listen . But no one ever heard . Dad could have , but he would n't let himself . No one else had the ear to hear . . . . And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I spoke . Half a word would have done and you had the sentence . And in the same way all the talk of all the people I 'd ever been with did n't really ever make much sense to me . Oh , I usually knew what they meant for themselves . But those meanings had no meaningfor me . And so I 'd been like a creature bereft of speech making my way through a strange world of unintelligible noises . . . . And though I 'm an ignorantP190girl in so many ways I always know just exactly what you mean by everything , Anthony , even when you speak of your science . I do n't know any facts . But I always understand your interpretation of the facts you give me because I grasp right away that if I had known the facts that 's just what I would have thought about them too . . . . It was n't all easy , though it was all soaring . We had to tell each other a lot about our past and it will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . And it 's full of pain to both of us , even though we both know that without that past we would n't be the people we are now , and that our happiness and harmony are due to what we are now and therefore to what our experiences have made us . It 's so clear as thought and so full of shadows as fact . Am I talking you , Anthony , or am I talking me ? I do n't any longer know . But this we do know , both of us equally , even though you 've reflected more and can therefore put it in stronger and exacter words : There 's too much naked maleness and femaleness in love . The male has his suspicions about the female and the female about the male and even in the very act of love they hold out on each other and next turn away from each other , each pursuing a stealthy private life which is streaked with suspicion of the partner , and estrangement , the female having her preconceived notions about the male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best cases all they achieve is an amused and kindly tolerance . But we 're two human beings , Anthony , who understandand trust each other to the very core and to whom God has given this ineffably beautiful passionate attachmentand keen deep longing for each other too andP191our bodies , when we are married , will speak to cacti other full of trust and understanding and tenderness . . . . Speak and sing together , Anthony , and not just one wreaking himself and one being wreaked upon . . . and not merely seven minutes of sadism on the one side and masochism on the other and then silence and coldness or even aversion . .. . And did I tell you  --  no , I did n't because I must n't hurt you even when , on your own principles , you ought not to be hurt  --  that both of my husbands  --  golly , it hurts even me to say that , though it 's so funny too  --  well , both , each independently , of course , accused me of a lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a little woman and lean on them . And I almost thought I was an odd creature , too , and all wildness and loneliness . . . . But , of course , there was nothing to lean oft , not a thing . And you need n't worry , Anthony , though I know you do n't think about things that way : I 'm leaning on you ; I 've been leaning on you almost from the first moment I saw you ; I ca n't imagine any longer what it was to stand so alone ... . But , then you lean on me , too , and I 'd think it a loving exaggeration if I did n't see you act it and not only say it  --  you , Anthony Foulk , of all people , you with that element of unconscious sternness about you . " Did n't anybody ever call you Tony ? " I asked you . And quite quietly you shook your head : " No . Nobody . " . .. You need n't be afraid . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit . But when you snuggle your head against my shoulder you 're a good deal of a small boy , just the same . Yes , I know about you ; there never was anybodyyou trusted enough to let yourself go even a little bit . I know . . . I know how it is myself ... .   Were n't those months and weeks in New York  --  spring weeks and summer weeks  --  lovely ? For the first time I liked New York in summer  --  sidewalk cafes and rides on top of the bus and even ferryboat rides . .. . Were n't you clever , Anthony , to have saved so much on your little salary that we could even see plays and hear some of the Stadium Concerts and dine out of doors at the Brevoort once or twice a week . And you bought lots of books , too , some for you and some you wanted me to read . And every week brought the final decree nearer and so us nearer to each other ... . Maybe I should n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you has made me forget a lot ; it changed things in my imagination to what they are not  --  it transformed them into your moral atmosphere . I 'd forgotten , for instance , how the aunts were . That 's why I was so taken aback by the sight of them when I came and answered Susan so sharply  --  took the trouble to , I mean . . . . I even revised my memories of Dad and thought he 'd immediately see and also let himself see , . . . And , of course , poor lamb , he both could n't and would n't and had been made miserable enough by the divorce , not to speak of my turning up right away with another man . Maybe we should n't have come together . . . but there  --  my old difficulty  --  and yours too , dearest  --  when we know that something 's right we expect everybody to perceive it and feel it just the way we do . We stick out our necks and do n't know that we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about when you wrote a paper which was a direct slap in the face of all the heads of your profession from Boas at Columbia up and down and you thought they 'd all thank you for the revelation of truth and revise all the stuff they 'd written and stood for fromp193twenty to fifty years . . . and you were surprised and outraged , at least at first , when they raised the very devil and nearly lost you your job . . . . Oh , how well I understand that , how well . . . how well . . . . And , of course , we 're paying for that again  --  as we both always have . . . . And that 's really what I wanted to think about and to think all over again tonight and I ca n't imagine  --  well , yes , I can too  --  how somehow all my past would come alive again here , in my old room , with the dear pines out there , this night , this hour ... . You had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ought to come to the house this morning . And I was n't any more either , after what happened between Dad and me yesterday  --  he never did order me out of the house before  --  but I did n't see just under the circumstances how I could do without seeing you a bit longer and , as you said , the fat seemed to be in the fire anyhow . And it was marvelous , whatever came or went , to see you here  --  here , here . . . . There 's someingcleansing and healing about it . And after the aunts and everything I just had to see you come in here  --  I always liked that whitish gray suit with the ambercoloredbuttons and your tan pullover  --  and have you take my face in your hands while the sun streamed in the windows and say : " You 're so beautiful I can hardly stand it . " I 'm still a little shy when you say things like that and you know it , of course , and so you added : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been mistaken for the prettiness that our happy country is so chock-full of . " I 'm beginning to know perfectly how your mind works . So I said : " This is going to be good , is n't it , dearest ? " Of course you said : " It certainly is . Ten thousand Earl Carrol cuties do not add up to the sum of one  --  you . " I pretended to applaud in fun . You were quite serious : " The difference is one in kind . " " Anthony , " I said . " Please do n't flatter me . " Then you grinned again , though I know how verygrave you really were : " A scientist never flatters ; hedefines . " I leaned against you . " How did I ever live without you , Anthony ? " " I ask myself the same question every day , " you said . " It was dreary and dull and lonely . " I wish I had n't said next : " I was n't even lonely . Or maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare to be alone . " You were suddenly a little wan : " That happens . " " Now I 've hurt you , my precious , " I cried . You took both of my hands . You speak to my hands , do n't you , and they to you . " We 're going to hurt each other , my darling , from time to time  --  quite without meaning to . But it 's better to be hurt by what is past and done with than by things that are ; it 's better to be hurt by echoes than by voices , by fading memories than by living facts . " I had a small moment of dismay : " You 've got it all figured out . " " Had to , my heart . It 's my way . " I looked up into your eyes . The pain in them had been conquered . " And it 's a good way , " I agreed . " Ca n't help wishing though sometimes that we 'd met long ago and been each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't , " you said . " Neither can I. It 's aP195pretty deep instinct . But look about you at men and women . Better than to be the first love is to be the true love . What is true is likely to be lasting . " Oh , we were in each other 's arms , were n't we , and so deeply . You are my man , Anthony Foulk , and I am your woman . I never felt like that before , and I do n't believe you did either . The situation came all over me suddenly . How could I help it . I got out of your arms and sat up like a lady . " We must n't forget what we came here for . Dad will come in any moment now . " You laughed and got up and stood there on the rug facing me : " Will he order me out of the house ? " I laughed too : " I dare him to . " " Well , " you said , " I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I cried . " Why , Anthony ! " " Not a bit . " Now I knew you were going to be slightly didactic . It fills me with a certain  --  well , yes  --  glee . " You tell me he 's always thought the world of you . No man , according to him , had a lovelier or more brilliant daughter . " " Right , " I said . " So , " you went on , " he quite properly expected to be able to be very proud of you . O.I . What happened ? Jenny Jones graduated from Radcliffe with high honors and got a marvelous job and Jessie Smith married young Moneybags and has that mansion on University Drive . And Joy Munson ? Expelled from Smith , no job she dare mention , twice married , twice divorced and about to marry a third time . Whom ? An anthro- pologist with no social position , no money and a salary of $4750 . Is that a pretty picture ? " Of course , you laughed and so did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you put it . What 's wrong with me that I do n't quite ever see his side ? " Now you were immensely grave . How I love you , Anthony , when your mind begins to glow and burn . " You , young woman , are deficient in a sense of social realities . Few people live the lives they wanted to live or the lives they like . If they have bright and handsomechildren they want from them social and **26;2890;TOOLONG for their lost dreams and bartered freedom . With these lost dreams and this bartered freedom they want at least to have bought something . Your poor father got no normal return on his investment . Is that clear ? " Oh , dearest , I got up too now and faced you . You were ever so right . But you left one element out of your accounting . I had to tell you about that . " The reason I blame my father for raising these rows is that he knows better . If he were like his friends and business associates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lawyer or the sensitiveness of an undertaker  --  fine , that would let him out . He has n't . He has n't . Oh , Anthony , there have been times when he 's let me see his real self . He knows that truth is better than cheap triumph and that even to be seeking something high , however falteringly , is better than to be contented with things that are mean and second-rate . " I 've always thought like that , Anthony . But I laugh and blush now thinking of that speech of mine . I'mp197already beginning to use your ways of expression . Why , it was you who told me about the English essayist  --  what 's his name ?  --  that you 're so fond of who said he wrote for truth not for triumph . Anyhow you 'd gotten your teeth into the argument and said : " That makes it all the tougher for him . " " How ? " I asked . " He 's probably had to be contented with the mean and second-rate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've blamed him for just that . " You shook your head then : " You should n't . People can almost never buck society . Society is too strong . " " All right , " I said . " Should n't he be happy at my having a chance then ? " " That 's asking a terrible lot . The example of even the smallest victory makes defeat harder to endure . " You were sad when you said that , my dearest , sad as though you were sorry not only for Dad but for all men . . . . It 's that , it 's that in you  --  oh , and so many other things too  --  but it 's that not least that makes you the answer to all the crying of my heart through all the years ... . " I can see that , " I said . " I can see that that must be so mostly . But in this case it is n't someone to whom Dad can begrudge anything . It 's me . It 's Joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl Dad used to take me places with him  --  out in the country and in the woods  --  and pour himself out to me in , oh , a very real way . He tried to fill me early with his own sense of the beauty and sadness of things and the mystery of God 's dealings with man . He did . He really did . " " And in recent years ? " you asked .   " We 've walked more apart , " I had to admit . " I wanted to tell him about myself  --  all , all ! He would n't let me . He 'd ward me off with some conventional platitudethat would make the words stick in my throat . " You nodded as though you understood that too . I teased you just a tiny bit for knowing so much . But you protested : " It 's not so hard to understand . I do n't want to be coarse and call it jealousy . Just the same  --  " " Oh , Anthony ! " I cried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it this way : he did n't want to be hurt by knowing about the things that took you away from him . " " They did n't  --  not really ! " " No , " you agreed . " But how was he to know that ? And now his worst inner fears are coming true . " " Why now ? " I asked . Then you grinned just a little , did n't you ? " Because , " you said , " I 'm really taking you away . At least I hope and trust . " Then you grinned a little more and got sententious as you do  --  you know you do  --  when you 're a little shy . " I 'm fatal and final . " Ah , dearest , that hit home . All of Dad 's loneliness came over me . I looked into your eyes , Anthony ; you looked into mine . With you I 've learned not to stop at the shallow places . We wade in . " I know , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretended to myself I did n't and you make me drop the pretense . It 's very sad and not at all just . Dad 's not happy and never has been ; nothing in his life is right for him  --  not the big successful store nor , nor anything . He knew it long ago . I was to make up toP199him for everything . I was , in a way , his star . But I do n't think he knows himself just how that was to be done . Nor do I. And so , whatever I 've done  --  there the thought of him has been clawing at my very heart . It 's love , of course ; but even more it 's been compassion . At the strangest moments that wrenching pity for Dad has come over me and gripped my very vitals . " You laid your strong tender hands on my shoulders . " It 's a recurrent phenomenon , dear heart . If Freud is right and the sons once killed the Old Man of the tribe , it may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may have been out of that unbearable pity , too . " You dropped your arms and I took your head in my hands to kiss it . Oh , and  --  yes  --  just then we heard footsteps . . . . Dad . . . . Dad was sort of cool and pale and ever so businesslike . He actually tried to sneer a little at the thought of what his attitude to man number three ought to be . . . . Did n't quite make it . . . . He 's too sweet . . . I tried to be natural . " Hello , Dad . This is Dr. Anthony Foulk . " Funny and pathetic , the formal way Dad said : " How do you do ? " You were dear , Anthony , and funny too  --  the way you half-stretched out your hand and Dad just sort of took it and you said : " Sorry to be a nuisance , Mr. Munson . But since Joy and I are engaged it could n't be helped . " Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Are you a doctor of medicine ? " I wanted to giggle . I know by now how that question teases you , Anthony .   I 'd seen it a hundred times , only you 've taught me to define it and it is infuriating . " That 's pretty sickening . " Dad actually tried to grit his teeth . " I 'm no reactionary and no prude . I 've gone my own way and can be pretty independent . But when a girl not yet twenty-nine marries twice , is divorced twice and I shudder to think what all else and then turns up immediately with still another man  --  well , that 's mere looseness and people have a right  --  " I had my arm through Dad 's by this time . Remember , Anthony ? And I had you by the lapel of your coat . Your face was red . Lucky I 've got a little bit of influence over you already , darling . . . . There was no sense in you and Dad continuing to shout past each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought that was enough now and said : " Anthony , my darling , you go back to the hotel now and have your lunch and write the letters you told me about and I 'll telephone you this afternoon . " I do n't know whether you caught the astonished look on Dad 's face when you sort of broke into a smile and said : " Of course , sweetheart . You 're right , as usual . Goodbye , Mr. Munson . " Dad just mumbled a goodbye and peered at me . I was taking a part in my relation to you , Anthony , that was utterly new to Dad . But he threw off that impression ; he would n't let it sink in and make any inferences from it . Because when I got back from taking you to the door and seeing you get into your car he was droopy and crushed and worn-looking . I actually believe he was pitying himself . I did n't have the heart not to ask him if he was tired . " The news is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salespeoplein the store know ; Miss Hilton , my secretary  --  you remember her  --  had the cheek to say quietly : P203'It may n't be as bad as it looks like now . ' My barber  --  " I could n't help laughing a little and I asked : " Is it really truly your opinion , Daddy , that I should arrange my life according to the opinion of the salespeopleat the Wright-Munson Company and of Miss Hilton and of the barber ? " Dad surprised me now . He does now and then . Yes , he has before . . . . I can remember other times . " Is n't that pretty cheap of you ? " he asked . " You know they 're just examples . All sound and good people would have the same reaction . At that , public opinion has broadened . In my father 's time a divorced woman was an outcast . Well , that 's all over . But  --  but this  --  but your carryings on ... " He made me feel childlike and unprotected and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " My very voice was small and shy . " Why did you break up with John Stewart ? " he asked . That was unexpected and I was still feeling a little like a scolded child . " I hardly know any more , " I said . " Anthony has helped me to forget all the ways of the dead people , the people who were n't ever really alive . I was n't of any more use to John than he was to me . He went to his office in the morning and came back at six to dine . He paid the bills and played golf on Sundays and holidays . We also went to dinners and once in a while to a musical show and we gave dinners and parties and people talked a little gossip and a little politics and a little  --  oh , I do n't know , because nobody ever said anything , and Friday night , if he was n't too tired , he 'd want to sleep with me  --  "   " Stop ! " Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . .. . " All right , " I said . " All right . Anything more you want to know ? " Dad was so rasped ... . " Why did you come home and bring that man with you ? " That helped me , Anthony ; that recalled to me our talks , of course , and you 're agreeing with me that I must follow the feeling that urged me to go . " I 'll tell you , Dad , " I said . " I need n't have come ; that 's quite true . Anthony and I could have got married and gone off to the Southwest where he works . But you see , you 're my daddy , and I ca n't , of course , remember a time when you were n't there and often and often during the years we 've been very close to each other , have n't we ? " " God knows we have , Joy . " Oh , Dad , I had n't meant to pierce you so nor pierce myself so . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , did n't I ? " There must even be something in that stuff about the call of the blood , " I said . " I ca n't just get rid of you ; I ca n't just leave you out of the reckoning . I know that in a way I 've gone counter to all you hoped and wanted . Yet I always thought that way deep down you only pretended to yourself that you wanted any worldly kind of credit through me . I honestly thought that in your heart of hearts you wanted something different and better . Did n't you , Dad ? " Then Dad spoke out of his true self at last , at last : " I always thought there was something unusual , something even great in you , Joy . "   " I know you did , " I said . " And I 've never been able to justify that belief of yours in any way that you understood or wanted to understand . So I came home to justify myself to you a little at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to myself . But that was it . And Anthony Foulk was to be my justification  --  " Yes , Anthony . . . . You are right . . . . And of course I 've known it . The relation of father and daughter is so strange and difficult . Every father wants his daughter to marry well in his special sense of well and yet resents the man  --  any man , every man . . . . " Good Lord , " Dad burst out . " Another man ! " What else , what else ? I wanted to ask . Unless a girl has a compelling business of her own  --  profession or art or what-not  --  it 's bound to be a man . Glad I did n't say that . . . glad I stuck to us and said : " That 's just what Anthony is not  --  another man . He 's the substance amid shadows and the living among the dead . " Oh , that went home . Dad believed me , I know . And he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was white  --  poor lamb . He switched off : " You know what my life has been . " Now he had me . " I think so , " I said , " though whenever you 've told me anything or hinted at anything you 've taken it back and unsaid it two days later . " " A man has to be loyal . " That depressed me so . Why will Dad always scurry back behind some rubber-stamp ? " That may mean such different things  --  some good , some pretty terrible . But go on , dear . " " I 've had nothing . " Oh , Dad was bleak . " Emptiness ,  | Joy , except for you . And since you 've been twenty you 've been away most of the time . And that was bad enough . You know I hoped you 'd marry some fine boy here . " " Yes , " I said . " Anyhow you think so now . " " Why should n't I have ? " he asked . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and what has been here again and again and all around me was whispers and evil reports behind my back and silence to my face . Silence . I come on a group of men at the club and suddenly they stop talking . I 'm a minute late to a Chamber of Commerce meeting and they 're too exuberant  --  trying to cover up what they 've been say-ing . " Then I could have cried . That was so true . " Things were getting a little better , " Dad went on . " Then came the bombshell of your divorce from Stewart . Still I was ready to defend you and stand by you and I hoped you 'd come home in spite of all  --  " " Well , I did , did n't I ? " " But alone , Joy , alone ! " He did shout now . " Not trailing a man through town . Not that ! Not yet , not right away , not now ! I do n't see how I can stand it ; I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think because she says little that it is n't telling on your mother and you know that the sisters have never been fond of her and they torture her through you . You just do n't think . You have your fun and let the chips fall where they may . " Oh , I would have been crushed , crushed and contriteand nothing else if he had n't talked about the fun I 'd had . That , that  --  Oh , Anthony , I know we 're both too unconscious of what people think and too sure of the good impression we 'll make and terribleP207stickers-out of necks . Seeing it in you has made me see it ' more clearly in myself . But that bit about my fun . . . . I cried . I did . But I laughed too . " Fun ? " I said . " That 's funny . I 've tried to hack my way through darkness to a little light . And nearly everything is so dark and so touched by death . And yet what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of the light . Has n't it ? Is n't that so ? " He would n't answer . He was like a stone . He was letting me down again . So I let it rip . " But now come the men at the club and the men of the Chamber of Commerce and the salespeople at the Wright-Munson Company and Aunt Gertie and Aunt Millie and Aunt Alice and Aunt Sue and undoubtedly the Reverend Mr. Stringfellow and they all say  --  oh , like a chorus  --  I can hear them  --  sort of in unison : There must be no light . Darkness is good enough for us . Why not for her ? The hussy always acted as though she were better than the rest of us . See what comes of it ! Plain immorality . It is funny . It 's far far funnier than even you know . " I cried hard . I think I sobbed . No wonder I had to do what I did later ; no wonder I 'm sleepless . I had n't cried in so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe if I were . But once I got to crying this afternoon I guess I shed all the tears I should have shed  --  sounds a bit melodramatic but just happens to be so  --  for years and years and years . . . . Guess so . . . . Of course , Dad 's own eyes got all dim and he was choky and he begged : " Do n't , Joy , do n't . " And , of course , though he did n't mean to do so , he took advantage of my emotional state and stroked my hair the way he used to do when I was a kid and said : " All I ask is that you consider your mother and me a little . We do n't know  --  any of us  --  how long we 've got to live . Mother is really far from well . " " What do you want ? " I asked . He pushed the advantage he had over me . Yes , he did . " You 'll agree , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulses have cost you pretty dear . " I had to admit that . " Yes , Dad , I do n't deny that . " " You married Buck Browne on an impulse . You suddenly married Stewart on another . I do n't know and I do n't want to know what other impulsive actions you 've been guilty of and what you 've paid for them . " As he meant it , that was grotesquely false . But at that moment I was so down and so soft and weepy I thought it must be true . So I just asked him please , please to come to the point . " I do n't ask much , " he said . " Stay here for a year , for six months . Help your mother and me and the family to have a clearer position in the community where we 've lived so long and where we 'll die . Think the whole matter over . Test your own feelings . Then , after a while , if you still feel as you do , announce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married . " I sprang up , Anthony . I was never so terrified in my life . No wonder I had to go over all I felt I 'd be plunged back into  --  all  --  all the darkness . I cried out : " And if I lose him ? " Dad laughed . Yes he did . A hard laugh too . " If he 's all you say he is how is that possible ? " I tried to come out of my mushiness and be hard and straight . " I 'm beginning to talk like Greenfield already . I mean this : If we lose each other in the confusions of the world ; if his faith in me is diminished ; if lifeP209begins to blunt the fine edge of our oneness and our concentration before we have a chance to  --  " " Tell me sincerely , Joy , " he said , " is n't that a little far-fetched ? I 've never asked you a favor before . I ask you to stay here six months and then , if you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give the man that much of a test too . You never have before . If he 's the man you tell me he is he 'll consider my proposition fair enough . " " It 's wrong , " I cried out . " It 's wicked ; it 's playing with death . " Dad drove his point home . " Will you do as I ask ? Will you help your daddy out that much this one time ? " " You leave me no way out . " Why did I say that ? " I have your word ? " he asked . " You have my word , " I answered . Why ? Why ? I must have run an honest-to-goodness temperature . . . I was wild when I realized what I 'd done . . . . I had to see you , Anthony . . . just to be sure I had n't had a long long wonderful dream , a crazy mirage and was back in my old life of the times before you came to me . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed , that there was someone like you in the world who thinks your thoughts and speaks your words . Was n't it lucky , lucky that I remembered Timkins ' bar and could describe the exact location to you over the telephone , Anthony ? Was n't that fine ? Do n't know how I got through the rest of the day ; do n't know how I got through the dinner . . . . Could n't eat , of course , just kind of feverishly quivered and Dad talked and then lapsed into long silences and Mama just kind of felt that everything was upset and sort of crazy but would n't let on but quite deliberately  --  it 's her habit  --  withdrew into herself  --  oh , simply went off wandering in her own mind or seemed to ... . And I was wild and yet in a way paralyzed and did n't have the nerve to call the taxi till it was eight o'clock and I 'd asked you to meet me at eight and then the funniest thing happened for this one-horse town  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times  --  that the taxi-man had just come from Montreal and was new on his job and did n't know where South Street was and fooled around and fooled around till I saw Timkins ' dim little sign a block away and paid that fool and ran ... . I 'll always love Timkins ' place as long as I live . Had n't changed a bit  --  the long bar and the high-backed brown wooden booths opposite and that nice beery smell and Pete , same old Pete at the bar with his precise Irish face and his cool contemptuous eyes pretending to see nothing and taking in everything and just two young chaps a little bit drunk at the bar . . . and you , you , Anthony , getting up in one of the booths where you 'd been sitting with your face toward the swing-doors so that you could see me the minute I came in and so get up and I could see you  --  just like you to take that little extra thought . . . . You and I , you and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . . . . Oh , it was like  --  like laying down a heavy burden and like coming out of a blinding fog  --  just like that and you were n't a bit put out . Anthony , but sweet and glad and you said with a kind of triumphant expression : " So you did manage to get away . "   " But I 'm late , I 'm late , " I said , " and you know that 's not my way . " " I know , " you said , you lamb , with so much conviction . " Dad could n't very well say I was n't to meet you . I 'm no child . So he wrangled about where . " Telling it to you took all the ugliness out of it . " Naturally , " you said . " I simply vetoed your coming to the house , " I explained to you . " I needed to be with you . . . you ... " ' You squeezed my hands . I told you how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel ! " Then I added that I did n't really blame him . It was the pain in him that made him shout . And then you said so crisply : " It usually is , " that somehow we both began to giggle and I teased you : " Are n't you the bright boy ? " " Me ? " you said . " Look , sweet , I 've got a paternal ancestor too , do n't forget . Best guy in the world . But he wanted me to go into the warehouse-trucking business . And I assure you that to this day I have pangs now and then because I just could n't . " " Of course you have , " I said . " There ! " you said . " Who 's bright now ? " " Well , " I said , " we just ca n't help it , neither one of us . " You bent over and kissed my hands and said : " That 's always been my opinion . " The least little things between us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sweet . . . . " Did he know you were telling me to meet you here ? " you asked . " No . He had the delicacy to leave the room when I phoned . He 's at home now torturing himself as to where we are . He does n't know I know of the existence of Timkins ' bar . Mother really does n't , though she 's lived here all her life . We used to sneak here when we were seniors in high school . " You beckoned to Pete then and , of course , you did n't realize that Pete knew that I knew that he knew who I was and that he was speculating at a mile a minute and it sort of made me tingle and I pretended not to notice and used my lipstick . Pete 's voice was stony : " What 'll it be ? " " Two Scotch and sodas , " you said and I do n't know why I quailed before Pete and gave a little cry : " Not for me , Anthony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean that , sweetheart ! " You did n't notice how Pete said : " One or two or what ? " Yet you did sniff some kind of impertinence too . Because you were so stern when you said : " Two ! " Somehow we both laughed , did n't we , and I chat-tered : " Oh , Anthony , is n't it whacky ? You know that liquor means next to nothing to me . One reason I could n't even try to make a go of things at one time of my life was that the crowd around could n't have a good time unless they were soused . It was all ever so postwar still . And you 're beautifully drunk only when you 're exquisitelysober . And here I am in the depths of embarrassment because somewhere in me I can hear Dad saying  --  Mother would n't soil her lips with such things  --  saying something about a girl who drinks whiskey in a bar with a man . " Pete served us while I was going on and I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , do you think he heard me ? " Then you threw back your head and laughed , did n't you ?   " Oh , my sweet , you amuse me so ! " " Glad I amuse you , Doctor , " I said . " Well , " you said , " better to laugh than to cry . " You were suddenly grave . You wanted to know . I still played for a little time : " I 'm not at the point of crying about this . " " Neither am I , " you said . " But you told me on thephone that you 'd given your father a certain promise . " I felt myself shrink and my voice get small : " Yes . " You were willing to spare me all you could and give me a little more time , were n't you ? " I do n't know what it is yet , " you said . " But you gave that promise out of the same whacky deference to the father image ' that made you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , let 's at least enjoy our drinks . " You were thirsty , were n't you ? I took a few sips too . Then you were fortified and said in your crisp way : " Out with it ! " So I had to tell you . " Dad broke my heart and so my will too . I promised him to stay at home six months or so and then , if our feelings had n't changed , announce our engagement in proper form . " It did hurt me for a moment , I confess , to see your immense relief . " Well , " you said , " that 's not so bad in itself . " " You do n't think so , Anthony ? " I asked . " I 'm in the depths of despair and terror over my cowardice . " Oh , you were grand , Anthony  --  you were , you were . You took both of my hands in yours again across the table , Pete or no Pete  --  and he was watching , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at such a moment . And you said : " If you knew me as well , Angel , as you 'll know me ten years from now you would n't mind the facts involvedat all . I have n't had any better luck in life hitherto than you . Maybe worse . Nothing but death can separate me from you . If you love me . You do , do n't you ? " I told you , Anthony , I told you . I did n't know , you know , I had it in me to love anyone so  --  so deeply , so unselfishly . Yes . Unselfishly . " Why , then , " you said , " I 'd be happier and less lonely knowing you were thinking of me a thousand miles away than actually being with anyone else I 've ever known or ever imagined . " I wanted to snuggle against you , Anthony . And I 'm no snuggler . " You 're sweet , " I said . " I feel the same way about you . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the other things he pleaded , I know he has an even deeper feeling . " " What is it ? " you asked . " Oh , that it 's so undisciplined , so lecherous , so , oh , savage , to get a divorce in August and marry again in September . As though , like an animal , one could n't wait . " Oh , but you flew up . And somehow I loved you all the more for your flame of rage . " That settles it ! " I could just feel Pete listening in the small of my back and I did n't care . " I think you 'd better break your promise . I 'll get a license tomorrow . " Was I meek ? Did you think it of me ? " Why does that settle it , dearest ? " I asked . " Whac infuriated you so ? " P215You , shouted . Oh , yes , you did . " The rancid and inexcusable folly of people . Savage ! Ha , I ' heard that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more cruelly crushed by taboos and conventions and the resultant inhibitions than we are . We are least like savages when we follow our highest monitions at the expense of taboo . The high man is subject only to his conscience and his God . " How you rang out , Anthony , like a bugle ! Never cease . . . never ... . " I 've known my father in certain hours to have an inkling of just that fact , " I said slowly . " Maybe so , " you said . " I hope so . But take that other bit of yours : You 're like an animal if you do n't wait . Well , the animals do n't know what it is to wait . ' They mate by instinct in the mating season . Then they quit . Man alone knows love and choice and impatience and devotion and renunciation . Man alone . " " Yes , yes , " I agreed . How could anyone not ? " How clear that is , once you think . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What ca n't loose and silly people use as an excuse ? But that 's nothing against fact or reason ; that 's only a condemnation of their own looseness and silliness . " I felt a little forlorn for a moment , Anthony , as though you 'd somehow moved away from me into a stark cold world of thought . That 's why I begged you to stop being so stern . Oh , how you melted right away . " I wo n't , my heart . And I take back what I said about your having to break your promise . I know your father is subject to all kinds of pressure  --  social , per-sonal . " " He is , " I said . We were so cozy again . " And he ca n't get away . There 's no escape for him  --  not any .   Not even a holiday . He 's never really had a holiday . Wherever he goes all his involvements go too . And Mother who really adores him could n't even be brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except my goings-on , though she 's never been anything but sweet and gentle with me . According to her he 's a very happy man  --  successful , prominent , in good health , an example of all the virtues in his community . " I laughed and yet I felt a little weepy too . " And , Anthony , look : My career , as it must seem to average people , does look a bit God-awful . I 'd like to comfort Dad a little for a little while . I 'd be happier in the long run if I did . But I ca n't , ca n't lose you now that I 've found you . " You saw the moisture in my eyes , did n't you ? And you took your big lovely linen handkerchief out of your top pocket and dabbed my eyes with it right there at Timkins ' across the table . . . . " Not a chance , " you said . " Try to get rid of me , young woman . It ca n't be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll have to decide on other grounds . " " All right , " I said . " Let me see . Let me see . I want to please Dad because I 'm so dreadfully sorry for him and also to ease my own feeling of guilt toward him . " " Correct , " you said . How your eyes held mine . How I knew what you wanted me to say , not because you wanted me to say it but because you wanted me to have the insight out of which to say it . I 'm beginning to know you . " But if I do that I yield to the very prejudices that have ruined his own life . I 'll be making it easier for myself but really I 'll be playing into the hands of theP217very forces that make for all the misery and all the tyranny in the world . " How you can glow . " Bright girl . Wonderful girl . As wise as you are beautiful . " You were so solemn I had to grin : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case , if anything . " But now you grinned too . " Let 's have another drink on that ! " " Dearest , " I whispered . " It 'll be all over town to-morrow . " " Naturally , " you said right out loud . " So we might as well enjoy the advantages of our inevitable disgrace . " And you sort of snapped your fingers at Pete and called for two more drinks . He brought them right away , and we could n't help almost laughing in his face . " When do I have to make up my mind , what there is of it ? " I asked . " Well , " you said , " first , it 's over two weeks before I have to leave for the West . " " But what will you do ? " " Whatever you want me to . Whatever will make it easier for you . " I think the way you said that married us , Anthony , much more than any minister will . You said it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine yourself doing anything not tenderly regardful of me , as though that was , of course , your particular job in life . Did n't know such things were . . . . " I 'll stay here , " you went on , " or I 'll go back to New York and then return here . Whatever seems best to you . " What I felt was too intimate and piercing for big words . I just said :   " You 're a good kid . " He finished his Scotch and soda at one draught . I like the strength and definiteness of all his actions . He never fumbles . Yes , that 's right . . . . He seemed to catch an edge of my thought and to want to sort of sum things up . . . . Yes . He hates loose threads . " Listen , Joy . Let 's understand each other . You 're the only woman I 've ever loved or wanted . The only one . We 'll get married ; we will , please God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up your mind about this thing . It 's only a detail . You 've stated the pros and cons as well as anyone could . O.K. Suppose I stick around for another day or two anyhow . " " Do that , " I said . " You 're everything to me . I 'll call you in the morning . " " Fine ! " We got up and Pete came over and you paid him and asked him if he 'd call us a taxi and you must have given him a big tip because he said : " Sure . You bet . Right away . " " I 'll take you home , sweetheart , " you said , " and then keep the taxi and go back to the hotel . Eh ? " I told you that would be sweet . And it was . . . it was . . . . And I knew from the lights that Dad was still up and I also knew he was relieved that it was n't what you could call really late . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midnight . . . . And will I ever ever get some sleep . . . . I ought to try to get a little ... . Tomorrow  --  no , today  --  it 's today and it 's been today for hours and hours  --  is the dinner party  --  Dad 's birthday  --  andI ought also to make my decision . . . ought . . . ought . . . . And I know I wo n't be tired , even if I do n't get much sleep . I 'm too alive to be tired and the world is too beautiful for me to be tired . Oh , P219if people were happier they 'd be less tired than they are . . . . I 'm so sure of it , so sure . . . . Now . . . . I never knew about that before . Oh , there 's the dawn  --  so faint a flush on the sky 's rim  --  faint still as the flush on flowers that are half-open . . . . Did you sleep , Anthony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Good morning . . . . Wo n't it be lovely when we live together . . . when we can say good night . . . when we can say good morning . . . good night ... good morning . . . good night . . . good morning ... . P220GOOD OLD SHELBURNE ROAD with the clean wind ... . Tramp , tramp , tramp .... I 've walked it  --  How many times ?  --  hundreds , hundreds . . . . Came out here years before I ever thought of building the house . Came out to see the pines with the wind in their faces . . . . Guess that gave me the idea to get strength walking with the wind in my face . . . . Clean wind  --  straight from wild plateaux far North . . . . Does a man good to get out of the heat of houses and out of the heat of people and be by himself with the earth and the wind . . . . People are so hot and so urgent . Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose it depends on the people and what you feel about them . I 've never felt anyone as cool or healing except Joy  --  Joy now and then . . . . One reason I do n't play more golf  --  fine and wide and cool and windswept as the links are  --  is the people , the people and their talk  --  their hot talk ; even when it 's amusing and casual , it 's hot . . . . On this road it 's always been cool for me and Mother 's always resented my tramping it just out of an instinct she has . Was afraid of my being cool and alone . . . . Well , she got a lot off her chest this afternoon . Ca n't say I do n't respect her for it ... Joy knows about the coolness of the road . Always did . . . . Said when she was just a girl : " Had a good tramp , Daddy ? You look so much better . " There areP221things no one ever knew except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't admit it . . . . Could n't , would n't . Did me good , her knowing , just the same . And today  --  she 's the same as ever and yet changed . How 's that ? She 's more the same than ever , more freely herself , less , well , repressed . No , not repressed at all . Sort of victorious  --  victoriously herself . Gentle as ever . But somehow authoritative . . . . The way she packed that man Foulk off yesterday . . . and he enjoyed it . The way she packed me off fifteen minutes ago and told me to go for an hour 's tramp before dinner . . . and I enjoyed it . I 'm enjoying it now . She knew I could n't for once get through that dinenr and evening without some relief . I would have exploded  --  badly . Not because it 's any good or anything can be changed or improved ... . Just irritation , just too much in two days . Maybe , too , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wonder where she did meet that fellow . . . . Anyhow , her coming in at a decent hour sort of calmed my nerves and I did get quite a bit of sleep last night ... . Building up here gradually even though this town does n't grow so very much . Spoils the sweep of road .. . spoils . . . . That is n't what I want to think about . Thinking stuff to conceal the thoughts I want to think  --  want and do n't want . . . . What is the use ? Did all this have to happen  --  all this tearing up , plowing up , unburying of corpses ? . . . And Joy had to come  --  and I wanted her really , too  --  but did she have to come for my birthday and it was that , her coining , that made the ghouls begin to dig . Ghouls . . . . I do n't mean Mother . She did n't dig up ; she does n't dig up ; all that must have been alive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be a little peace and quiet after today , after we get through that dinner tonight  --  that birthday dinner .   Maybe . . . Joy promised me ... maybe Joy and I can have a few good times . What am I fooling myself for , as I have again and again and again ? What for ? Oh , Joy will keep her promise . And what good will her being here do me if she 's here to keep a promise  --  even if keeping it gives her a kind of satisfaction ? It wo n't be a free being here because she 'd rather be here than anywhere in the world . Just as my being all I 've been and doing all I 've done is worth nothing , nothing , nothing . . . . Keeping promises . . . . Not disappointingpeople . . . . Free choice . Nothing else is any real good . What does the Gospel say : Whose service is perfect freedom ? ... That 's what 's good . . . . Merciful God . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service that was not perfect freedom to their souls  --  why the world would n't last two minutes  --  society of any kind would blow to thunder . No , I 'm not wise enough to think it out . It looks as if more death is required of us than life . Do n't know . . . do n't know ... . Ha ! Right about here near that clump of silver birches I used to begin to think that thought . . . . Would be winter mostly and after dinner . Dark road with no street lights nor traffic lights as far out as this in those days . By moonlight or even just starlight those birches would gleam and shimmer and then I figured out  --  funny and sort of superstitious  --  that I was far enough , especially from the old house down on Jewel Street nearer the lakefront  --  I 'd figure out or just have an instinct that now I might think that thought and have that weird fancy . . . . Was n't originally my own idea . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read that story in school . But I kept the book and came on it years and years later . Story called Wakefield . . . . Wakefield lived with hisp223wife and children in their house and seemed a good man and well enough satisfied . One day he stepped out . Without a word . Just stepped out . Never came back . Never was heard from again . Yet it seems that he did n't go far . Just a few blocks away . . . managed not to be seen , found , observed . . . managed . . . . Of course , that part 's unlikely and just a story . Point is he left . For what ? To be alone with his own soul . . . . Guess his real hopes were gone and his true love  --  what he thought his true love  --  lost , lost , and it was too late for him to do anything he ever really wanted to do . So at least he wanted to be alone , not to be bothered , just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quieter , sadder and quieter . ... It used to haunt me , that tale , walking evenings along here and coming to the silver birches . . . . Have n't thought of it for quite a while .... No wonder it comes back to me today . . . . Did all that have to happen ? .. . But I might have known . . . . Very little is ever spared me of what could happen . . . . Because I seem calm and cool and they lay it on thick . Everybody lays everything on thick . Started first thing this morning . . . very first thing ... . Had n't slept too badly and was glad to be in my office . Nice cool bare place with a good far view from those top-floor windows  --  my office . Always does me some good . Do n't have to have people . Can order them out politely . Can say I have no time to see so and so . . . . Well , I saw right away that something funny was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mail which was pretty clearly not business mail and from the telegrams but from Adeline 's perkiness . She seemed neater and more withered than usual . Why does she always smell of starch ? . . . She 's just about the last woman with long hair and when she pokes her head forward because she wo n't wear stronger lenses her hair smells musty . First-class secretary . . . been with the company for twenty years and never missed a day . . . never missed a day . . . . Ought to be hung out in the wind . They used to leave people on the gallows in the old days , I 've read somewhere , and the wind tossed them ... . All that mail made me feel suddenly dreary . Tried to be as usual and said : " Good morning , Adeline . " She gave the mail a last pat over my shoulder and come close . " Good morning , Mr. Munson . Fine morning . " I looked at all that stuff . And I made a mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept it aside instead of remarking on it and pretending I did n't know what was up . Because , of course , that gave her an opening . " Do n't you really remember ? " I smiled . . . . Why do people smile when they want to scowl ? It 's supposed to be a virtue . It 's become a lie ... takes the guts out of life . . . . I should talk ... . " I did n't think of anyone making a fuss , " I said . " Well , Mr. Munson , " she said , " other years nobody does much . But this year your birthday coincides almost to a day with the fortieth anniversary of your connection with the store . " She took up an attitude there in front of my desk like someone going in for what used to be called elocution and said : " From cash boy to President . " Most men in business would have been pleased , I suppose . Some would have laughed .... It just rasped me . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've always been all wrong and unable to have the right feelings and reactions . Too late to change . . . . And , anyhow , a kind of a mean suspicion came to me  --  mean but true . .. .   " Why go on about it today ? " I asked . " I 've been President for eighteen years . Seems to me I 've been running this store one way or another ever since  --  Never mind that . " The suspicion came up in my throat like indigestion , like the results of a sour stomach . " Adeline ! " " Yes , Mr. Munson . " There 's something malicious about her . Talks about her fine job and what a fine boss I 've been . Talks too much . . . . And has it in for the whole world . . . . Result of permanent virginity , of course . . . . Musty . . . . She and my suspicions and all that had happened  --  well , the combination was almost too much . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd rather not say , if you do n't mind . " Do people have to be like that ? I wonder .... I 've often wondered . . . . It 's like their smiling . . . it 's like all the things some wind ought to blow clean . . . . They 're not clean . . . . Joy is the only one who 's clean . . . " I most certainly do mind , " I said . " Who ? " " Mr. Wright . " She knew she was lying . She knew the thing from A to Z as well as I. Been around long enough and used those chilly near-sighted eyes ... . " You mean Eleanor Wright , " I said . " That 's what you mean . Thought she was getting ready to go South . " " Did n't do her arthritis much good last year . And now that she 's practically confined to her wheelchair it did n't seem worthwhile . " " But she has a telephone , all right , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought so . So she read about my daughter'sdivorce and then telephoned all over town heaping up a mountain of poisonous gossip from everybody ,   including my sister Susan . Then the bright idea came to her . " " Mrs. Wright always was pretty smart . " It did n't strike me till later , not in a sense till this moment , what a contemptible thing that was to say under the circumstances . But just then I was going on with my own thoughts . " And the bright idea , " I said , " was this  --  to make a big fuss over me which I 'd have to pretend to accept as consolation but which in cold fact was meant to rub salt into my supposed wounds . She put the old man up to it . Abner Wright 's mind does n't run in that direction . " Adeline acted quite innocent . Oh , she has no grasp of exact facts of any sort . But she 's seen a lot these twenty years and she spends all her spare time putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long .. . oh , for long ... . " He 's coming to see you this morning , " she said . " When ? " I asked . " Most any minute now . " No , I do n't have to turn back yet . . . . I can go on till I reach the woods . . . maybe even have five minutesin the cool woods before I turn back to lights and people . . . . Have n't had to see much of Abner in recent years . He 's taken his money and stayed away . . . . Says he 's glad things are going so well and his income is so large but rather not see the new-fangled ways at the store .... " Do n't feel no more hardly like it was the store my father started and he certainly made something of . . . " Possible . . . very human sort of way for an old man to feel . . . . Wo n't say , ca n't say that he finds it hard to bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite pleasant to remember his benefaction top227me . . . how he virtually " made " me . . . . Do n't know . ... He may be , far as he 's concerned , perfectly sincere and utterly unable to imagine what he did to me ... . I get so confused with the world and everything the world says and means or wants to mean or thinks it ought to mean  --  that I myself ca n't sometimes recall exactly how it all went  --  step by step , treachery by treachery , and on my part cowardice by cowardice . Abner was a Judas .... But so was I. . . . But I had to be on account of Ma . . . . Did he have to be ? I must n't .... I blame other people for digging up the dead . . . . Ha ! ... Yes , I 'll get to the woods ... . Did n't really think this morning . . . just went numb ... got up and walked to the window and looked out and told Adeline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'd take care of the rest of that stuff later . Then the buzzer sounded and Adeline said  --  and I swear there was a faint sort of evil in her voice  --  that Mr. Wright was coming up now . Furthermore , she said , there would be a committee of the employees later on ; they had a present for Mrs. Munson and me . Good Lord . . . . But the door was already open and there was Abner  --  Abner Evander Wright . . . . He 's shrunken , though he never was a big man . Got to remember he 's all of seventy-seven . . . . Same well-tailored black suit with the long coat . He 's still the old-style respectable merchant with a dash of the deacon . . . bald as an egg now , but his eyes bright and blue and full of the old slyness  --  kind , too , in a way , but stealthy .... I ought to know . . . . I ought to know . . . . Shaky now , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . ... Same old senseless , infuriating titter . . . . Wind 's died down . . . but I can see the dark woods from here , dark except for more birches . . . . Be sun- set soon . . . . Be night before I get back . . . . Sunset  --  fine word  --  set of the sun  --  would n't care if it set for good . . . . No , I do n't quite mean that either . . . . We do n't know , I sometimes think , exactly what we do mean  --  any of us , any of us . . . . Once I thought God knew . . . . Whole lot less sure now ... . I did my best . He 'll never know  --  not he , not anyone . ... I got up and I smiled and I said : " Well , well , well . You have n't been around for months . Glad to see you . Sit down , Abner . Do . Make yourself comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward and sidewise like a dog 's . Said : " I guess that 's all for now , Adeline . " She went out straight and prim . She was in a rage . That did me a little good . I got up and shook hands with Abner and sort of helped him lower himself in the leather chair . He tittered : " Good to be here , Henry . We all been thinking about you these days . " I simply said : " I guess you have . " He settled himself deeper in the chair . " Thinking . Thinking . Hee-hee-hee . Not much else for an old man to do . Well , I did my share of work till I retired . " " You certainly did , Abner , " I said . " And we did n't have no gadgets in my time , " he tittered . " Work was work . Abbie 's boys are hell-bent on going to college . Just like your joy was . Hee-hee-hee . " That was the entering wedge all nicely sharpened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " Fine , fine . I tell her not to waste her husband 's goodP229money on this rah-rah business . It 's just a way of shirking . Especially her youngest , Fred .

Take , I said , take Henry Munson . He wanted to save money to go to high school . Well , he did n't . Next he studied nights by himself thinking he 'd prepare himself for college . Well , he could n't . Too many family responsibilities . Hee-hee-hee . Then , like a good man and a good citizen , he got married and buckled down and no more nonsense out of him .

Forty years . " ... Where have they gone , the forty years ? It 's fall again .... Hour by hour life seems long .... Year by year it seems short enough . . . . Good thing for most .. . maybe for all ... . " Does n't somehow seem that long , Abner , " I said . " It do n't for a fact . No , it do n't . Seems like yesterday when I said to you : Henry , it do n't do you no good to be seen with that Rita La Belle even if her mother was a Wells . Her father was a Kanuck all right . I knew him . By golly , he used to paint pictures of women without no clothes on . Hee-hee-hee . ' Member ? " " I do , Abner , " I said . " And I said to you , as I was telling Abbie and her mother , I said : You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a fine girl , a grand girl , come of a fine family , too . Did n't I say that to you ? " " You did , Abner , " I said . " It all comes back to me like it might ha ' been this very day . And that must be nigh unto thirty years . Is that right ? " " That 's right , " I said . " Sure , sure . Because Eleanor was saying that your girl Joy must be all of twenty-nine . Hee-hee-hee . " " Not quite , " I said . " But pretty nigh , I guess . " " Yes , " I said . " And I was telling Abbie and her mother how I said to you . And furthermore I said , I ca n't promote no young man to be in charge of advertising and publicity and responsible for hirin ' and firin ' girls and women who 's married to a Kanuck . And I was right , was n't I , Henry ? "   ... They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really a kindness . . . . Still , what good did it do if they did n't drug his heart ? " It would seem so , " I said . " And it was a good thing that Kanuck girl left town , I told Eleanor . They said she went to study dancing , did n't they ? " " I believe so , " I said . " Dancing . Hee-hee-hee . " Abner lowered his voice . He was furtive . . . . Fox . . . dog caught stealing ... . " I heard a joke about a dancer once , Henry . First she stands on one leg  --  " Swine , too . . . . It 's the swine who inherit the earth . . . . No . That 's wrong . Still : they do inherit the earth . . . . Did he think I 'd let him go on ? I pretended to laugh  --  quite loud : " Never mind , Abner . That 's hardly becoming for us , is it ? " He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue eyes . For once he did n't titter . " Well , Henry , that 's as may be . I seen quite a bit of life in my time . " Why did my heart sink ? . . . Why do I want the wind to blow me to pieces ? . . . Oh , I despise myself . . . like , like ... and then again I do n't .... My birthday again . ... I . . . the worm that dieth not , dieth not ... . " I have n't , Abner , " I said . He twinkled out of his swine 's eyes : " I do n't believe you have for a fact , Henry . Well , I do n't mind telling you today I ai n't sorry for nothin ' ! So long as the wife and the community do n't know . What people do n't know do n't hurt ' em . Why , at that first big Chicago Fair  --  course I was n't married then . But you would n't remember . Hootchie-cootchie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't believe you ever had anything much to do even with that Kanuck girl  --  " Oh , I suppose that had to come sooner or later .. . sooner or later . . . that I would n't be spared that . . . that a swine would grunt it at me . . . that I missed , that I lost ... irretrievable . . . . I said what I felt thirty years ago and what he 'd understand now ... . " I loved and respected her , Abner . " He tittered . It was more like a rat 's squeak . Maybe only seemed so to me . Like the squeak of the rats in Father 's barn . . . . He began slowly to heave himself out of the chair by his big knotted red hands on the arms . . . . " I guess you did at that . Hee-hee-hee . " More like the rats than ever . " Well , Henry , I 'm sure glad to have been visiting with you about old times like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart . Shake , Henry . " I touched his hand , did n't I ? Well , of course I did . More . Worse . I acted as if everything was all right  --  as I always do , liar that I am , hypocrite that I am , coward .... What 's the use ? I said the proper thing . When do n't I ? " I certainly appreciate your coming , Abner . Rememberme to Eleanor and to Abbie and her husband . " " I sure will , " he said . I took him to the door and opened it for him and closed it behind him and then latched it because I did n't know exactly what I 'd do next  --  maybe cry ? Maybe scream ? Nothing of the sort . . . .

Ca n't be brought back and ca n't be re-lived . . . . And just when a man has settled down to that conclusion and is good and cold inside  --  they begin . . . . Abner . . . . Elizabeth . ... Elizabeth . . . unbelievable ... . Walked home , did n't I , at a quarter of four and went right upstairs to our bedroom , thinking Elizabeth was in the kitchen directing the maid and getting things ready , hoping I 'd have half an hour by myself , planningon a shower . There was Elizabeth rocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she hates with such a troubled look in her eyes . . . . I must start back . . . . But I can go slowly through the dusk and the dark and watch stars come out . .. . The way back is always shorter than the way out , even when it 's the same distance . . . . I 'll always , I think , see Elizabeth from now on as she sat there rocking .... I 'll always hear the things she said to me . . . . Oh , maybe not . . . . " Why , Mother , " I said , " I thought you 'd be busy from what you told me ? "   " I was till just now , " she explained . " Had my chickens all nice and everything , you know , and my pies ready . Then Violet got a telephone call ; seems her sisters husband is dying . Anyhow she ran right out on me . " I tried not to act relieved . " These maids . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . " " It made my head ache dreadfully . " " We 'd better call the whole thing off , " I said . " No sense in it anyhow . " " No , we wo n't call it off . Joy is in the kitchen . She 'll take care of things till I get up my strength . " My heart rose a little . That seemed homelike , almost  --  oh , as if there might be something festive . " Joy ? That 's fine . Fine . And you feel a little better now , do n't you ? " " Yes , " Elizabeth said . " And I 'd have felt even better if that old Eleanor had n't called me up just before I was coming upstairs . She talked and talked . How did you make out with Abner ? " " Oh , all right . Though you know Abner always did make me angry from time to time . " " I know , " Elizabeth said , " and he is n't so much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Eleanor . Goodness , gracious me . " How we are trapped by any bit of sympathy , by any appearance of agreement . I walked over to the bureau to see what linen I 'd change to and let myself think aloud . Have n't done that three times in thirty years . And today  --  of all days . . . . " Abner 's always been a braggart . I do n't say he did n't work hard in his time and did n't use a lot of sense . P236But he never denied himself a single thing he wanted all his life . " I 'm afraid  --  I 'm sure I sounded bitter . How foolish of me . " Not a single thing . " I knew right away from the way Mother started rockingharder what a fool I 'd been . " And you did , of course . " " I would n't say that , Mother . " She rocked and rocked . " I know , you never did think I had any sense . " " Now listen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " But I knew I was trapped .... Escaped for years and years . . . escaped a discussion till things were no longer living and no longer true . . . so I thought we 'd just let it all go . . . . But Mother 's voice had a strange faltering determination in it : " I know what I know , even if I do n't read books and did n't care about this big showy house and did n't  --  " " Do n't let 's go over all that , Mother . " I almost plead with her . " No one is finding any fault with you . " " Just the same I know that you 've always felt pretty sorry for yourself . " I tried to laugh , did n't I ? " The last thing I 'd dream of doing . " Her mind took a kind of a leap . But she knew her direction all right . " But , after all , you did marry me . Nobody forced you to . " Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . If I 'd spoken a few love-words to her now , as I 've done again and again , she might have stopped . . . . Something in me must have wanted to help tear up the scars . . . . Otherwise why did I ask : " Whatever do you mean ? " P237There was an old , old rancor in her voice . It must have died down from time to time . . . but it never quite died . . . I heard that from her now . " You could have married that Rita La Belle . Everybodythought you would . " " Oh , I do n't think they did , " I said . I 'd got over that weakness . I wanted to put things back where they had been . " Everybody has a flirtation or two when they 're young . You were my only sweetheart and you are still . " I wanted to go to her and soothe her . She got up and stood behind her chair . . . . Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day for not being like that sort of woman . Every day for thirty years . Think I do n't know ? " ... You live beside another . . . you share the bed ... . You do n't know . . . do n't know . . . . I looked at her straight . " Ca n't figure out what makes you say things like that ! " " Well , " she said , " maybe it was Eleanor 's telephoning . Maybe it was Adeline calling up to say the people in the store were giving us a set of china . What do we want with more china ? My , my , all the things we 've got now ! Maybe  --  but , goodness , I think of it often enough without . " " You do ? " I seemed to feel my eyes stretch wide . " Oh yes . I do n't read books . She would have . I do n't like to have much company . She , oh , she would have filled the house with grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York to take in the shows and I do n't care about our subscribing to the Alumnae Concerts . Well , I never did care much about things like that . Father did or , leastways , pretended . I just did n't . And you were n't brought up to it neither . And I do like to sew and I do n't always want to wear those old boughten dresses from the store or from New York ... " I had n't seen tears in her eyes for years . " Mother , Mother , " I cried . " What 's got into you ? " " I do n't know . Not exactly anyhow . There are things might better be left unsaid . I never expected to say them . But there ! And most of all you blamed me for  --  " Never had I seen her eyes so cold and so , oh , hostile . ... The tears were gone ... . " What ? " I asked . " I do n't know how I can say it . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call cold . " She blushed like a girl . . . . Good Lord . . . . Her eyes softened ... . " I 've loved you in my own way , Henry . " Maybe I 've never felt sorry enough for her and too much for myself . I can admit it here and now . . . . I meant what I said at that moment : " Of course you have . And now let 's forget all about it and prepare for the birthday party . " It did n't sound right , though , even to me , what I said . " That 's the way you always put me off when I want to say something . So I quit saying much . But I 'll finish now . " It was very strange . . . . I must walk more slowly ... . Plenty of time . . . . There are those birches again ... . Did I want her to go on ? Anyhow , I told her all right , to go on if she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead a little . She said : " So I 've never had you to myself . There was always somebody better than me . Always the memory of that woman and later on  --  oh , ever since she was a little girl  --  Joy . "  |p239How  bitter that was to me . " How does Joy come in ? " I asked . " She has n't even been around so very much in recent years . " " But it was her you were thinking of . You confided in her . Maybe you two never said it in so many words . But you and she agreed that I was kind of foolish and that you 'd had a hard time . She was the only thing you cared about . She was the kind of woman you would have wanted for a wife . And , of course , it most killed you every time she got married . And it 's most killing you now . And I ? Oh , I 'm just Mother ' and you both tried to be careful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make you uncomfortable . But you considered me the way people consider a bad child that they ca n't get rid of . " Is anger always a screen ? Maybe not always . . . . But where would it get us today to try to unravel  --  to try to find out how much of what she said was true the way she meant it ? . . . Nothing to be done about it . . . . The past is like a wall . . . . You ca n't batter it down . ... Better turn your back , it seems to me . " It 's preposterous , " I said , " that you 're jealous of your own child . " " Do n't you go blaming me . It 's your fault . It is n't Joy 's either . I have n't blamed her . She 's my only baby and I love her . I 've been less hard on her than you , because I knew you egged her on . " That did seem to me going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  yes , that 's right  --  tense as I 'd never seen her before . " Oh no , " she said . " You always let her know how unhappy you were and how dull life was for you because you not only got married but stayed married and did all the things that other people do who want the respect of their neighbors and their community . It was written all over you all the time . So , of course , it gave Joy the idea that a person ought to do what they want to do . And then when she did just that you went and blamed her because you wanted to keep her to yourself . " One way of looking at it . . . maybe . . . . But I just felt terribly tired and discouraged . . . . Certainly not like arguing . . . . " Is n't it a bit late in the day for all that ? " I asked . " We 're not as young as we were , Mother . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . I have n't had such a wonderful time either . But you 'd better dress now , if you 're going to . " Oh , it was stupid to flare up . Just nerves from all that 's happened the last two days . " You 've put me in the right mood , have n't you , for dressing for my birthday party ! It 'll be horrible ; it 'll be a mockery  --  " What a blessing that Joy came running in , pink and triumphant , with one of her mother 's big aprons on and with a sort of singing in her voice : " Everything 's going to be fine , Mom , just fine . The chickens are browning deliciously  --  " Then , naturally , she stopped and looked at the two of us , looked from her mother to me and asked : " What 's wrong ? " " Nothing , " Elizabeth said . " Do n't pay any attention . " Something in me ripped . . . . Think I see now why . .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and where to stop . I 'd made , so to speak , the arrangements . For Elizabeth to do that  --  well , there was somethingconfusing and infuriating about that . I looked at Joy and her eyes seemed to draw everything out of me.  | " Mother has just told me that my whole life has been virtually a sham  --  that I 've always loved another woman and blamed her for not being like that woman , and that I 've been so crazy about you because I thought you were the kind of girl I should have married and that I 've been hard on you because I was jealous of you , and that , that  --  oh , what 's the use ! And now on top of that she calmly tells me to dress and face a birthday party . My God ! " " Yes , " Joy said quietly . " I understand . " What had I expected her to say ? What ? Why did I cry out : " What is it you understand ? " Again , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these last few days . . . so earnest and calm and good ... . " I do n't think , Daddy , that you 're in a mood to listen . It 's a bad moment for discussion . " She looked at her wristwatch . " It 's twenty of five . Look , Dad . You go and take a long walk . Then come back and change . It 'll give Mama and me a chance to finish the dinner and dress , too . Nobody 's coming till half past six . How 's that ? " Her eyes told me as plain as words that she knew how hopeless talk was and explanation and then the expression in them plead with me . And I said : " Maybe that is the best thing to do . No doubt . " And I went out and closed the door softly behind me and stood still for a moment at the head of the stairs . Should have gone on . . . but that latch never clicks  --  never has  --  especially when you try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Good Lord . . . eavesdropping for the second time in two days . . . . Never before in my life .   ... I could just feel Elizabeth turning her eyes to the door : " I know I 'm foolish , Joy , " she said . " But I feel sorry for your father just the same . " " Yes ? " " Because I did n't force him to marry me , you know . He was older than me  --  old enough to know what he was doing . And he 's acted like a martyr year in and year out and you know he has . " Have I ? Have I ? ... Do n't believe it . . . . Ca n't be possible ... . Joy did n't say yes or no . She said : " Maybe , then , it 's wrong to be a martyr  --  wrong to oneself , wrong to the other person , too . Is that what you mean ? " Poor Mother . . . . That was beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't rightly understand you , " she said , of course . " No , I do n't think that 's what I mean . What I mean is that when people deliberately choose their partners they should abide by that choice . I know I have . I did n't care how poor your daddy was in the beginning nor I did n't care so much when he began to make all that money . I was glad to be Mrs. Henry Munson and if he 'd been satisfied , as he ought to have been , I would n't have had a thing to complain of . Not a thing . " Merciful God , as if satisfaction were in a man 's will ... as if he did n't want to be satisfied if only he could be ... as if he did n't pray for it . . . . Joy 's voice was hard : " Then you would never have let him go ? " I never heard Elizabeth so shrill and sharp : " Why should I have ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of it . That 's why I do n't see why I should be sorry for him . " I could hear Joy sigh . It was almost a groan . " Tough , " she said . " Oh , more than that . As for being sorry for Daddy  --  he 's broken my heart a hundred times . But do n't think , Mama , that I do n't appreciate what you 've had to bear . I do . I do indeed . Only  --  " " Only what ? " Elizabeth was still shrill . " Oh , it 's so hard to explain and it 's all so sad . We have no time for more talk now . The dinner is planned and the aunts will be here and Alice is bringing her husband , is n't she ? " " Yes , she 's bringing Harold . Goodness , I wish I 'd never have to see any of them again . " " I know it , " Joy said , " and I do n't blame you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd stolen your father from them and as if I did n't appreciate him . Well , they are n't so much , are they ? " " Certainly not ! " Joy 's voice was warm . Glad it was . Glad she said that . Glad she went on : " I 've been furiousat that a hundred times . And the funniest part of it is , of course , that they do n't know Dad at all . So what they think is of no importance . " All the shrillness had gone out of Elizabeth 's voice . " You 've been a comfort to me a good many times , Joy . Funny I should be so jealous of you , now and then . " Joy is the only human being who ever makes sense as far as I 'm concerned . Why ca n't I understand better what she does  --  or do n't I want to ? She kissed her mother now . I could hear it . Just right . ... And she said : " Do n't you worry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You always look particularly sweet in it . I smell the chicks . And I want to put in a telephone call before I dress . " " Did the man deliver the ice cream ? " Elizabeth asked . " Yes , " Joy said . " Everything is hunkey-dorey . You have n't a worry in the world . You could even lie down for ten minutes . " " You know how to fix things when you want tot " Joy laughed . " Darling , my strength is as the strength of ten . " " What a funny way of talking , " Elizabeth said . " Why ? " Joy laughed again : " Because , Mom , as the poet goes on to say , because my heart is pure . " Then I went , though I heard Mother begin to say something else . . . . Crawled down the stairs of my own house .... Out on the Shelburne Road .... Nearly back again . . . . Do n't know that my walk 's done me so much good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my head  --  turning , turning . . . . No nearer any conclusion about anything in spite of all that turningof the wheel . . . . I 'm beginning to wonder : Do we ever reach conclusions in any way that makes sense . ... Oh , some kinds  --  whether , on the basis of last year 's figures , we should order so many hundred gross of this or of that , depending also on whether the stock has permanent demand or should be peaked for sales , and what the original mark-up should be . . . . Oh yes . . . . Conclusions like that can be reached with considerable certainty . I can tell pretty accurately how many fortyninecents ' brassieres we 'll sell . . . . But the things that matter . . . . Good Lord . . . . Stars out with a cold glitter . . . and that last , big house on Delancey Street there with all the windows on the first floor glowingP245orange is my house . . . . And the people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by this time , my sisters . . And none of us really knows anything and certainly none of us knows much about each other , except maybe Joy and I  --  and that 's only a little . .. . Wish I could stay out here and think and watch the stars and feel the wind while they have the dinner without me . . . . Must n't just stand here . . . . Might bump into Gertie or Sue or . . . . What a world . . . . Ha ! Always remember a little tag from a poem in one of the books I bought to prepare for college . . . . Funny old poem .... Do n't know who wrote it . . . do n't know it made much sense .... But those last words . . . . Never could forget them : " What are we ? I know not . . . " That 's Alice and Bowers across the street .... Well , here I go ... . P246IT IS ALL in me forever now : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Joy with her head against my shoulder . And a little before that Joy with her indescribably shining eyes defending herself and me . Yes , herself and me and so much more  --  the very freedom and goodness of life . . . . Why did n't we linger for another hour in the dark ? Because our hearts were too high , too near bursting . We had , each of us , to be alone with the image of the other , with the image and scarcely endurable knowledge that we had found the way to that rare place which is both ecstasy and home . . . . Of course , we knew it before . We knew it in Boston . We knew it during those months in New York  --  on our long ferry rides , on our excursions into the Jersey woods , in our all-night sessions in remote foreign quarters , eating exotic dishes , sipping exotic drinks , learning the heights and depths of us , finding ourselves instinctively together in every depth , on every height , watching more dawns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew . And we would have gone into outer wilds together , seeing that we are both creatures of the wild . . . . But just because we are that ; just because we are , as Joy says , stickers-out of the neck , born rebels and reformers of life itself , it is good , good beyond measure that we do n't have to waste our strength on smaller frictions and minute social conflicts but can live from a center of peace .... P247Even so it will be breathless . Even now I 'm tempted to put my hand over my heart to still it a little , a very little . I dare not , simply dare not think of the actual sacraments of our marriage . They will be sacraments and mysteries . They will be akin to glory and to vision and yet pierce us with human sweetness to the marrow . . . . And if ever two people needed the mystery of oneness , it is we two who have always been alone . Joy has been very much alone . She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard no answering voice . And as for me ... . Odd enough that this high hour should be mine in a hotel room here in Greenfield . Is it that hateful , slick , mechanical place  --  a hotel room , with no evidence that there is such a thing as the human spirit but the Gideon Bible on the dresser ? Well , what 's happened is that my aloneness , my desolateness has been taken away from me . I belong to Joy and she to me and through that we both belong within the universe itself , and all the ugly mechanics of the world are softened and melt into another pattern that is irradiated by the spirit of our love . . . . The fragmentariness is gone and the jagged fragments stick into us no longer ... . That 's it . . . . The sharp fragments stuck into me early . . . . I could n't make the Chicago of my boyhood and youth hang together . It was wilderness . It was n't wilderness to the other boys . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environments such as Joy 's are as alike as one drop of water is to another . . . . The " I " is the decisive factor . It is , quite scientifically , by God 's grace that certain people are incapable of enduringmeanness and spiritual mediocrity and shabby compromise . But it 's a terribly lonely business and more , far more than others we need through love to be given the power and joy to bear our peculiar destiny . We 're recusants . . . . Could n't go into Father 's warehouse and trucking outfit ; could n't go in for a run-of-the-mill profession that might bring in money ; could n't stay married to Lucille . Not would n't , as the fools think . Could n't break the discipline of the soul and slither along the easiest way to money and respectabilityand success . . . . People like you and me , Joy , ca n't let well enough alone . The " well " is n't good enough . It 's no good to us at all . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through love as others need bread ... . We 'll be no more imprisoned in alien moral atmospheres . We make our own . We need no more bend and strain after some communication with a deaf world . I used to go through stiff angular gestures to diminish the remoteness between me and man and his world . I shall never need to do that again . I used to do it at the demand or supposed demand of an outside force . But this demand was like a sergeant 's shouts in a barracksyardor a policeman 's whistle . We obey mechanically . They work no inner change ; they do n't persuade ; they have nothing to do with the will which remains quite unchanged , quite rigid . And we so yearn to be broken and be broken into and to have a living fountain struck from the rock of our isolation . We yearn for that so much that we go on hoping it will happen and look forward to meeting someone of whom we have heard good reports and we go stupidly even to parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faint yet quivering little pang of hope that this time , by the oddest of chances , oh , surely , this time there will arise before us one who will speak a magic word or be capable of a magic gesture that will take from us the burden ofP249that heaviness and melt the ice congealed about our hearts . . . . Of course , I love Joy 's loveliness . My eyes drink it in . But I do n't love her on account of her loveliness . I ca n't separate that or any other characteristic of her from the wholeness of her . I simply knew that first afternoon in Boston that her entire being was the magic word and the magic gesture . She broke me and broke into me at once and the angular attitudes through which I had been going almost always began to melt into fluidity and a current set in and began flowing from her to me and , I believe and pray , from me to her which brought and brings to life all that was dead and frozen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was dim and fearful , all has been warmed and irradiated ... . I think that this is love between two human beings . And if this state lasts , their love will last . The only chance for human love , anyhow . I 'm being moderate in my thoughts  --  trying to be . It 's an old old instinct ; we want to propitiate fate ; we do n't want the dark powers to think we 're too happy and too sure . We knock wood , so to speak , by understatement . But , of course , I 've really been sure from the first hour on  --  the first hour in which I saw Joy and heard her voice and spoke to her . We were at once not strangers . And most people are so accustomed to being strangers that they expect nothing else and nothing other . I did n't myself  --  I know it now  --  look forward to more . Doubtless , I would have said I did and did in fact say so . But our statements which spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be are always tacitly corrected in practice , and we renounce emotionally the hopes too high to entertain . There 's a prudence in this , too  --  a self-protective instinct . I know that now , if I never knew it before . . . . People meet and people part . Since they have remained strangers and are united at most by a group of habits , they can part with no more than the ripping of that group of habits . There 's a certain pain in that and a great deal of discomfort , as both Lucille and I found out , as thousands of others have done . But the pain lasts for days only and the discomfort for weeks only and today I have to think hard and reconstruct details in order to imagine , even to imagine , the six years that Lucille and I were married . . . . Joy need n't be jealous of my past . I 'm myself astonished at how little mark that long relationship has left on me . I must have lived within myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucille lived inwardlyI do n't even know ; I do n't think I ever really knew . I listened to her talk and after the first year or two did n't think that it made much sense and came to disregard it . Closed up more and more and that was a chill tight safe way of living . It was safe . Safe , if nothing else ... . Now I 'm cleft open ; I 'm cleft asunder . I 'll never be safe any more . There is another walking around in me ; a miraculous twinship has been established ; I 'm reborn and reborn no more alone and as one . As a wind bends two blades of grass that grow next to each other out of the same small spot of earth , so all the winds of the world and all the winds of fate bend Toy and me together and one can not be bent without the other ; we sway in the same rhythm ; we are as two strings upon a single instrument : they must vibrate harmoniously together . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other is so too . It loses tension , quality and voice . The change that Joy has broughtp251to my whole being , toward my whole way of being , is so rooted in innermost processes of the mind and probably therefore of the nerves and of the body itself that I feel sure  --  surer than of almost anything else  --  that my very life is dependent on her and on her being and on that being 's remaining utterly attuned to mine ... . No wonder that the vast majority of people are not dissatisfied with the mediocre feelings and experiences of which they are easily capable , or that even those capable of greater tensions are shy of them . For a love like mine for Joy is a terrifying thing . I can not know whether she will always remain as attuned to me or as deeply within me as she is now ; she has the right of aloneness and necessary withdrawal ; I must respect that in her , as she would in me . I can not tell whether her past has left her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the right to have been more touched by her past than I have been by mine . But I shall suffer if it is so . Yet it would be a damnable thing to impinge with any suffering of mine upon her right to her attitude to her own past . Not only is it hers . But human relationships mold a woman more , perhaps , than they do a man . Woman is more passive and plastic to their influence . . . . A man who is not a brute by any means can have an affair with a woman and hardly remember how she looked and stumble at recalling her name . It 's happened to me . To whom has n't it ? Here , in our society , it has been notoriously the commonest thing in the world during the past fifteen or twenty years . . . . But a woman ? Can she be wholly free , as wholly as a man , of the impress of relationships that have literally invaded the sanctuary of her body and therefore of her soul ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool to think such thoughts , especially tonight ? Not quite . I 'm simply aware of the gravity  --  the very life and death quality and decisiveness of my love for Joy ... . Yes , and that decisiveness has other consequences . We want children , Joy and I. The thought is almost unbearablein its poignant wonder . It seems to split my marrow . But I shall never want Joy to force the note of our continuous oneness or to take it for granted , to assume it when it 's not a living reality , merely becauseof our common parenthood . I do n't ever want that unity substituted for the initial unity from which it sprang . I want the miracle that has happened between us to remain pure and self-sustaining ... . It is a miracle , by God . I 've lapsed into these rather somber reflections  --  not that I 'm not a somber kind of creature in a way  --  because tonight the last obstacle was removed and the last seal broken and I know now that Joy and I will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is so great that it fills me with certain terrors . When we 're together there is no terror ; I have no misgiving whether I shall be equal to ultimate , quite ultimate experience . Joy is really a much braver person than I am ; perhaps women  --  though to generalizefrom her is stupid  --  are braver than men : braver about bearing both ecstasy and pain , surer of themselves , too , in these primordial matters , as they have a perfect right to be . I 'm scared that somehow or in some way I may be inadequate to joy and so may diminish the thing by which I live henceforth . I have no such small fears when we are together . She has such high courage and such luminous clarity about us ; she shines through my very being and in that light of hers I become as high-hearted and as gay as herself .... P253Of course I 've known it as a matter of science for years and years : man is afraid of woman . Primitive men do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with taboos  --  isolate them before , during , after menstruation , keep special mysteries from them , have them in some cases use a different vocabulary . And all men in all civilizations pretend that women are weaker than they are , fragile and in need of protection and try to prove that to themselves by crippling their feet in China or loading them with tall headdresses and crinolines or stuff like that . All vital statistics show the superior toughness and enduranceof women , their immense courage and tenacity to life . Man is stronger in a couple of muscles , purely localized ones , and in a sense from the neck up . And that superiority or at least difference from the neck up is actually a source of weakness . Man has more imagination and can think of more things to fear and when he has any touch of creative imagination he 's ditched ... . And also , men devaluate what they fear . All human beings do , in order to kill that fear . And that accounts in great part for the smudging and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the higher functions . And of that the male is guilty . It accounts for all the violent moral dualisms and for the Fascists and Nazis tearing the women out of the fabrics of civilization and limiting them to cooking and parturition . . . . The subjection of woman in all ages is due to man 's fear of his inadequacy . . . . When men , as among us , could n't keep women in harems any longer or in the " home " any longer they still had the one refuge  --  the degradation of sex . If sex is dirty , well , what the hell ! Every man is a devilP254of a fellow and the female the mere objective instrumentof his devilishness . . . . That way he is n't afraid . ... Oh , of course , the thing has deeply infected many women , too . I ought to know . Is n't that the story of Lucille and me ? Like most men she wanted  --  well , what ? Orgy . In one word , that . But I suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim . They 're licked from the start . .. . So are men . But they do n't know it . They experience the pleasurable bodily anticipation and the pleasurable pang of physical relief . Of course , they pay the price . Amusing that so many people know the old Latin adage : Every animal is sad after coition , and consent to it , instead of taking it as a symptom of the wrongness of the whole business . . . or , at least , of their attitude to it . . . That 's what I always somehow seemed to know . . . . Those were pretty wild tough girls in Chicago in my college days . It 's a wonder some of us boys did n't get into worse trouble than we did . Those multiple orgies and the boys betting as to who could reach the climax first and the girls screaming to get up to cleanse themselves . I joined in only twice .... I was so filled with horror and despair for the girls , because they were n't even professional prostitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were " treated " and given presents . They lent themselves to this sort of thing apparently just out of a desperate wildness  --  a crazy confusednotion that this , too , was " fun . " I think that wondering about them started me wondering in my sophomore year concerning just what made people act the way they do .... And then came  --  yes , that 's right  --  Freud 's Totem and Taboo and next Frazier 's Golden Bough and , of course , I did n't know till years later the errors in his conclusions and then did n't I have to stum-P255ble all by myself ( the assigned reading was of course Walden ) on Thoreau 's Essay on . Civil Disobedience ? But it was grand  --  that steady incandescence of the mind , that deep sense of being on the threshold of a true understanding of man and his problems . . . . My course was determined for life ; my path lay pretty clearly ahead of me . Have n't known any wavering since . And it is wonderful , really a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keenness of her perceptions and out of aware experience has been able to lay hold of the right central way of thinking about human problems . . . . That 's a sort of genius for living : to apprehend directly what others have to conquer slowly , laboriously , studiously . . . . Yes , it 's that that I feel as the element of the victorious in Joy . It 's that in her that seems to wind me up when , like a watch , I feel run down ; it 's that in her  --  that , too  --  which makes musical for me the many hours which used to be as devoid of resonance as leaden coins ... . God , yes , I turned what good solid citizens consider whacky pretty early . Poor Father , he did try to take an intelligent interest in his children 's education . He had n't much trouble with Amy , always apparently so clear and sharp , with her blonde precise little personalityand definite taste for social work , bound to get a good job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow unlikely to marry , as in fact she has n't ... . How she 'll love Joy in a strange contorted shy hopeless kind of way . . . . But the ' ourses I took after my sophomore year  --  they bothered Father . He fancied himself rather the strong silent type and seemed , in fact , always to live in a thick private world of his own . He must have had some interest outside of business and storage warehousemen 's conventions . . . . But But he and I really never managed to communicate . He would n't let us or did n't know how . He wondered what I was going to be . He kept telling me what a fine business we had and asking whether I had n't better take some courses in business administration . And when I had to tell him that I had already taken a job for the summer after graduation in the Southwest for archaeological field work , digging up the remains of pre-historic Indian cultures  --  I always remember that shock  --  he seemed to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , and sat down with a sort of gasp . I told him I was sorry and slipped in the fact that I 'd probably be able to support myself at graduate school . He was n't a swearing man and it shocked me when he said : " Hell , I 'm not interested in that ! " He did n't try to argue ; he 'd seen it coming , of course . I do n't believe he even troubled to tell Mother . . . . I must tell Joy more about that . It wrenches me still . Mother had always failed Father badly . Of course , it was tragic enough that that first child of theirs died of scarlet fever at four . But it was bitterly unfair to Father that Mother let it darken their entire lives  --  she had some subconscious motive for that , of course and became , as Amy once said in her flat but bitter little way " a perpetual weeping willow " and took to Christian Science and just went around again , according to Amy  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing her duty . " I sometimes actually wonder how Amy and I came to be begotten . Quite accidentally and tiredly , no doubt . But I confess  --  and it 's a weakness in me  --  that I 've really never pondered closely on my parents and their fate , as Joy has on hers . . . . But , of course , she had the motive of her father 's unusual affection for her and also hisp257unusual character . . . . There 's something impenetrable about my father . His father was a teamster in the early Chicago days and must have been a fine fellow . He was a Welshman and a Methodist and a great singer in choirs , as the Welshmen are , with a rude fine streak of poetry in his nature . I had to drag even these facts out of Father piecemeal and in a deadly kind of way . There was n't a trace of any of that left in him . With a strange hard vulgar arrogance he sniffed once or twice at a few Welsh expressions he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Odd and damnable that contempton certain levels of American life for all that makes man a little human . . . . It 's a dreadful weakness ; it 's kept us out of the war so far . We must , we must get in , if any shred of our souls is to be saved . All that is decent in civilization is being murdered , murdered and we think we can attend to " business . " Father wrote me just that the other day . And he has n't the excuse of senility . He 's only sixty-five and quite the man he 's always been . No , they talk that inconceivably immoral and blasphemous stuff in so-called solid business circles in the Middle West . The concept of " business " as having an absolute value and not as being merely a functionalthing by which material goods are produced and distributed in order that the higher activities of man may be the more freely exercised  --  that concept is the mark of decay in our civilization , as other civilizations have other marks of decay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as badly mired in materialism as capital . Nobody thinks of intelligible ends  --  only of second-rate means . . . . I need n't worry about that . We 're part of mankind . We do n't live on another planet . The war will come to us if we do n't go into it . Then a purgation may set in . . . . Funny , I always get a little angry when I think of Father , though I 'm not a bit angry at him . Probably I get angry so as not to suffer over my being so damned sorry for him ... . Common mechanism . . . . I tried to tell Joy one day how it was after my graduation from the university to get from Chicago to the Southwest . People do n't know America who know only cities and resorts or only little farms in the smaller states , lovely as they can be . And though the plains begin , of course , in Illinois , yet there 's a feeling that they 've been tamed and cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sense of lousy weather but not of elemental storms or vistas . There are a few vestiges of grandeur in Wisconsin  --  in the lake-country . And Indians do still set up their tepees by the sides of those lakes now and then . . . . But the Middle West is too stuffy with machinery and the machine mind . I 'd rather have Utah which looks like the bones of some eerie planet tumbled out of space and ruined here . . . . Western Texas and from there on  --  Americans should take compulsory tours there when they 're young . God is still in the desert and machinery is still a kind of death . . . . And when men make the machines their masters they 're subjected to death . . . . I think Joy will love the Southwest . The freedom of the spirit there will be a natural element for her . I 'm sure , quite sure . I 've told Joy , too , how after that first summer 's work I could n't bear to go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . But I have n't begun yet . I 'm not accustomed to telling anybody about anything . Few people are . We communicate a few surface things and these things , being merely surface , are false even when in an obvious way they are so . I suppose  --  it comes all overp259me  --  I 've sort of hugged my realities to me and almost scorned the communication of them ; my privacies both of thought and of experience have been luxurious to me . All that 's changed ; all that 's over . I 'll be , of course , as taciturn toward the world as ever . But Joy is beyond the world to me in one sense and my whole world in another . I want her to know to the point of vicarious sharing all that I have been , felt , done , seen until I am within her as she is within me , until the form of oneness , which we achieved almost at once , is filled with the content of our experience . . . . It will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . And not until I 've told her all the intimate truth about everything will I be quite free and quite whole . . . . There 's an amusing aspect to that . I can see us at breakfast five years from now and I can hear myself suddenly saying : " Listen , Angel . Just this minute it 's clear to me that that time  --  you remember , of course  --  there was another motive . . . " And joy will say , perhaps : " I never told you , did I  --  maybe I repressed it  --  that when Rosaleen and I were living in Chelsea ... " Yes , it will be like that . I think the impulses of a love like ours are akin to the artist 's impulse of communication . With this difference , that the artist wants to speak to the world , while each of us is satisfied to speak to one and wants , in fact , above all else , to confinehis speaking to that one  --  the one and only . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and only . I 'm almost tempted to agree with the old fancy of the human heart that for each aware soul there is a one and only . How rare it is to find that one . . . . How rarer still to find no insuperable obstacles between two such . That was the second part of the miracle in a world as confused and as full of all kinds of bondage as this , Joy : that when we met we were both morally and in the deepest sense free spirits and could make our eternal compact on the instant . But I 'll be able to tell you , Joy , why I could n't go back to Chicago . No doubt the situation at home had something to do with it . But it was deeper . Chicago sprawls so formlessly ; I never could make it denser or make the fragments form a whole . And formlessness is homelessness to me . And formlessness is lack of style , lack of cultural intention . New England has style . This town and old Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all have style . And a Navajo pueblo and a Papago village and even a small Mormon town in all its heart-breaking bareness , all these have style . Of course , I 'm thinking " shop . " But I took to this " shop , " as Joy sees already , not accidentallybut out of a passion for form in life which began , doubtless , in my hunger and thirst amid the formlessness of both Chicago and my parents ' home . If my father had been a man like my grandfather , a singing Welsh Methodist who attended Eistedfodds , my hungers and compensations might have been other . Although , of course , such after the fact suppositions make very little sense . Anyhow , I loved Boston ; I loved Cambridge . It tickles me , Joy , that you 're a New England girl . Your personal style is exquisitely akin to the best New England style  --  a few of the old churches and mansions , white villages with avenues of elms , clear mountain waters , the best verses of Emerson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You , of course , loved old Boston too . But you had bitter things happen to you there . . . . I did n't .. .. I 'm happy that we met in Boston , sinceP261I dare hope that that will make you forget the old bitterness and that we 'll always be able to go back to Boston in memory of our meeting . We will ; I know we will ... . I had a good time at Harvard right away . I met Ted Frank . That was the best . Ted , though he did n't know a damned thing about my work , caught my special notions at once . They clicked with some he had . He thought , as I did , that what is known as science had obscured the fact that in the beginning of all things is the soul of man . He had arrived at that conclusion through mathematics . So he at once pricked up his ears when I told him that all the theories of all the leading anthropologists were all wet , because none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group-souls primarily and were only secondarilydetermined by environment . . . . Well , that was in the very roaring twenties , just before the crash . God ? Soul ? Hell ! Love ? Hell ! Machinery , money , gin , fornication ad lib . The great age of the morning after and then another bender to make you forget the morningafter . On the threshold was the " red decade "  --  the time of the fellow-travelers and the pink rich and Russia of the Soviets identified for not a single damned reason with everybody 's private compensatory Utopia . So grateful , Joy , that you never fell for any of that stuff . Nearly all the people just a few years younger than I did . You did n't ; you could n't . Of course not . Too clear and too scrupulous . But it was maddening to see how almost everybody was , so to speak , singed by it . My professors , big men and men of merit too , smiled tolerantly at my " fool " theories because those theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . By God , a great purgation had to come .   ... It 's coming . . . coming .. . . I 'm just a little too old for combatant service , Joy . Do n't suppose they 'll take men of thirty-six or seven . But if they do , I 'll go . If I can I 'll go . The anti-Christ is loose in Europe , Joy . But he was subtly in our hearts too .... I 'll prove that to you , my one and only , as a scientist . God knows how long we 'll have each other . Let us be close , my beloved , close , close ... . It was great fun at Harvard . I was not much more than a kid and enjoyed intellectual belligerency . Every summer I got a job at field-work and so I sort of surreptitiouslyscribbled my dissertation in a tent during magnificent desert nights and sprung it on the faculty committee the minute I 'd completed my residential requirements . . . . Some scrap , that was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O.K. 'd my dissertation and let me take the final oral exams , and grinned at my impudence in trying to prove from the significant differences between two Amerindian culturesin precisely the same physical environment that the ultimate causative factor in styles of culture is psychical . . . . Their nastiness came later .... I 'm tempted to forget that . Tonight , of all the nights and days of life , I 'm tempted to forget all that is n't fine and clear . But they did n't recommend me for a job and jobs in our field are few . They just adopted what Ted called a policy of masterly inactivity . They played dead . If it had n't been for good old Dr. Parsons , the government man under whom I 'd been working summers  --  you 'll meet him , Joy  --  I might have had to go back to Chicago . Ca n't I see Father 's heavy contempt for a doctor of philosophy out of work ? Parsons did n't take to my theories either . But he did n't take to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the time and he did n't believe that the time for even hypotheses had come yet and if I 'd work with him summers he 'd get me a job to hand out whatever pap I liked to students during the winter . . . . You 'll like him , Joy , and be amused at the way his beard quivers when he 's being contemptuous in his cool way . . . . He did get me a job teaching . Assistant professor at $1750 a year . Oh , it 's a great profession , Joy . And most of the colleagues  --  notall , of course  --  ever so prissy . But even the prissy ones are extricated by the very nature of things from the merely gross and material and in the end its the only profession for a man who wants to live the life of the mind and consequently it is in the highest sense manly and human both . Yes , Joy , I 'll defend it even now that I 'm glad to be entirely in research . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when all is said and done , they do , however feebly , represent the human spirit in a set-up in which the coarse views of coarse materialists have spread quite enough disaster ... . We 'll live out there , Joy . We 'll start as soon as we 're married . So soon as we 're married . It 's hard to grasp . Even tonight it 's hard to grasp . It will take me years and years to fathom the miracle . Maybe I never will . Maybe I 'll die  --  I think I will  --  still in the midst of grasping the fact that it 's you , Joy , you , that I am holding in my arms  --  you , the destined and the wonderful , and not some accidental creature . . . . That 's the point . What is commonly known as love and what is commonly known as closeness are so accidental  --  accidental even though one can adduce causes , what are called causes . I want you to understand about Lucille and me .   I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common denominator between that relationshipand ours , and that for me to say , as in literal fact I must , that I 've been married before seems somethingbetween a blasphemy and a bawdy joke . And when I say that I do n't mean to be cheaply unfair to Lucille . That 's not the point at all . The point is that she and I were never married , though we had a license and a certificate and lived together for six years and in the beginning certainly felt quite a fondness for each other . . . . How am I going to explain that to you ? Just how ? Let 's see . First , I had lived fairly chastely  --  especially for that period . There was that woman , that school teacher , in a course in psychology I took . She was n't young and she was n't anything to look at . She was clever and desperate  --  just desperate . The now or never moment in a life . She 'd saved up money and had an apartment and got me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing had happened . Do n't believe poor Hester got a single even agreeable sensation out of it . I did n't much . She wanted to try again and again . Maybe a dozen times . Luckily , summer came and we both left . Pretty dreary and pretty sad . . . . And that was about all . . . and it left me hungrier and more thirsty for cleansing than I knew . . . . So there I was in that divine climate , in that almost perpetual sunshine alone and aching at twenty-six . And the girls in my classes , hatless , lightly clad , with that lovely free grave yet incandescent nonchalance of the modern American girl  --  a thing altogether lovely and right  --  well , the girls were almost more than I could bear . And being a teacher I had to be veryP265strict with myself . Very properly so . . . . And along came Lucille . . . . It was a class in sociology I had to teach . Rather fool subject . No substance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucille was small and dainty and had bright hair and bright eyes and a superb skin . Rose-petals and then some . She was a good student , too . Or seemed to be . She really had only a little gift for mental mimicry , seeming to understand and seeming to ask the right questions . But when a girl has skin like that and a man is twenty-six and most of the students are far from clever and the girl with that head and that body listens so carefully that she can ask the right question . . . . She was a senior , too , not far from graduation ; she picked me as her faculty adviser . . . . I 'm going over the facts once more to myself so as to have a clear grasp of them ... . She met me at the College Inn with her mother , quite a decent sort of woman , slightly arthritic , which is the reason why they had left Eveleth , Minnesota , where the father , the late Mr. Trask , had once  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why Lucille had gone to college here . . . . Naked passion gilds . The gilding seems to act as a scabbard and glitters ... . Must tell Joy that observation . Is it as true of woman  --  that delusion of power ? God , even Mrs. Trask did n't seem a bore then ; Lucille and I went walking , having again met , on the campus under those heavy lustrous stars . I explained my theories to her , the very abstruse ones , too . She took my hand in both of hers and pressed it to her young bosom . . . . I dug away near town that summer and came in several times a week and was n't surprised that Lucille and her mother stayed during the quite fierce heat
