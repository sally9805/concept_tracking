Henry Adams had damned the place with the faintest of praise . " Harvard College , " he wrote , " was probably less hurtful than any other university ... It taught little , and that little ill , but it left the mind open , free from bias , ignorant of facts , but docile . . . " In effect , " the school created a type but not a will . Four years of Harvard College , if successful , resulted in an autobiographical blank , a mind on which only a watermark had been stamped . " <P> Adams graduated from Harvard in 1858 , and returned to the Yard as a professor in 1870 . Though he did not know it , and would probably have been scandalized to hear it , he was teaching in what has since come to be regarded as the beginning of Harvard 's golden age . Last week , present-day readers could catch a little of the shine of that era through a new book by onetime Harvard Lecturer Rollo Walter Brown ( Harvard Yard in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The Big Names . It was , for the most part , the age of Charles W. Eliot , for 40 years ( 1869-1909 ) Harvard 's president and the grand seigneur of U.S. education . He was an erect and lofty gentleman , who " always had a fight on my hands , " and who could be both imperious and impatient in waging it .

There was Barrett Wendell , who looked as if he might have stepped out of the court of Queen Elizabeth ; pudgy Josiah Royce ( " the Rubens of Philosophy , " William James called him ) ; and Philosopher George Herbert Palmer , who once told a student : " It will hurt nothing at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fact , I sometimes think it would be a good thing . . . " And there was Charles Eliot Norton , the unappeasable pursuer of beauty . After his death , students guessed that he , would enter Heaven shading his eyes against the glare and protesting : " Oh !

He had wandered from art to medicine , to psychology ( " The first lecture on psychology I ever heard being the first I ever gave " ) , and then finally to philosophy . He was forever reading the books of unknown authors , or listening to the lectures of his juniors , lest he overlook some undiscovered genius . He detested " educated cleverness in the service of popular idols and vulgar ends . " As a teacher , he preferred thinkers of another sort : " Our undisciplinables are our proudest product .
