For six months , Federal Judge Harold R. Medina had suffered the taunts , insults and studied defiance of defense lawyers with weary patience , as they popped up like hammers on a honky-tonk piano-to protest , to object to rulings , to object to rulings on objections , to object to rulings on objections to rulings . Fortnight ago , Harold Medina , who had often talked as if he had had enough , acted at last . When the Communists ' lawyers tried to outshout him , as they had so often done before , Medina peremptorily ordered them to " sit down , " and had marshals see that they complied . " Your field day is over , " Medina snapped . In Manhattan 's Federal Court , the eleven defendants ( accused of conspiracy to teach the violent overthrow of the U.S. ) looked stunned . Even the lawyers seemed a bit subdued . <P> A Regular Formula . Medina warned defense witnesses that they might be jailed for contempt if they refused to answer proper questions , cut them off sharply when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ku Klux Klan or the Atlantic pact . " This trial would go on for an indefinite period if I received all the evidence offered every time two Communists talked to each other , " he said . <P> Last week sallow , bigheaded Robert G. Thompson , New York State chairman and a member of the Communist national committee , took the stand and promptly ran afoul of the new Medina . Thompson had been head of Ohio 's Young Communist League from 1938 to 1941 . Had he ever used the party slogan : " The Yanks are not coming ? " Thompson was vague : " Very possibly ... in all probability . . . it would have been consistent with policy at that time ... " Judge Medina broke in impatiently : " That 's a regular formula . It 's maybe this , and maybe that , or I may have , but he knows well enough whether he used it or not . " <P> " He Did n't Say . . . " Thompson had also referred to discussion by " the party 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only the " ranks " of the national committee . " You agree that in the Communist Party ' the ranks ' means the national leadership ? " prodded the prosecutor . " I object , he did n't say he agreed , " said Defense Lawyer Richard Gladstein . Judge Medina broke in : " That 's right . It might have been-he assumed it was-it may have happened-it probably was the case-it was most likely so-but Mr. Thompson did n't at any time agree it was so . " <P> But by week 's end , the evasive Mr. Thompson had admitted , with Judge Medina himself taking over some of the questioning , that the U.S. Communist Party taught 1 ) that violent revolution is inevitable in all imperialist countries ; 2 ) that the U.S. is an imperialist country ; 3 ) that the dictatorship of the proletariat can only be achieved through violence . <P> Said the new Medina grimly : " This trial is going to move now .
