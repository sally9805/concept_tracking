In sharp outline Canadians saw this week how two World Wars had buttressed the Dominion 's agricultural economy with a fine manufacturing industry . The lesson was recited by Reconstruction Minister Clarence Howe , who stood up in the House of Commons to give a final report on Canada 's World War II output and an outline of peacetime industrial prospects . <P> The war record was impressive and well known : as an arsenal of the Empire Canada had produced 16,200 aircraft , 28,000 heavy field and naval guns , 1,500,000 machine guns and rifles , 8,000 ships , 800,000 vehicles , ammunition in the millions of rounds . To turn out these and scores of other items , Canada had doubled pig-iron production , tripled non-ferrous metal production , increased chemical manufacturing 233% . Said Howe with pride : " This unprecedented expansion . . . has resulted in manufacturing becoming the leading industry of the country . . , and on a production rather than an assembly basis . " Turning to peacetime production , he pointed out that the Government had spent $720 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-quarters of it on facilities wholly owned by the Crown . At least two-thirds of this was suitable " for good use in peacetime , " and " satisfactory progress " was being made in conversion . At the same time private industry , which spent half a billion dollars in war plant expansion , had now earmarked $200 million more to boost output . <P> Canada , Howe declared , " had gained a new place as an industrial nation . " To hold that place in peacetime , the Dominion would have to probe new export markets , expand old ones .
