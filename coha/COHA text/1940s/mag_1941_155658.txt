They call it all sorts of names : " jeep , " " beep , " " peep , " " bug , " " chigger. " * But by any name this homeliest item in the U.S. Army 's rolling stock , the 2,200-lb. midget combat car , has , after a year and a half of service , been recognized as an unexpected and unique success . <P> Lieut . Colonel Ingomar M. Oseth , the Army 's No. 1 jeep expert , said last week : " Transportation in the U.S. Army is at least 50% superior to that of any other army in the world , and the jeep can grab a big share of the glory . " Echoed Major General Courtney H. Hodges , Chief of Infantry : " It is , the most useful motor vehicle we 've ever had . " The men who have to use it give it even more affectionate pats on its sawed-off back . <P> The jeep , a stubby , bouncy crossbreed between the half-ton command car and the motor tricycle , is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of only 80 in . ( Ford V8 : 114 in. ) and a fourwheel drive that provides enormous traction for its 42-h.p. engine . It has no trouble pulling light field pieces , can skitter along a road at 60 m.p.h . Designed to replace motorcycles and sidecars for reconnaissance work , it can go anywhere a cycle can , and a lot of places a cycle ca n't . It can be used as a troop carrier ( three men easily , six with crowding ) , weapon carrier ( machine guns , 37-mm. anti-tank guns , mortars ) , communications truck ( to mount radios and carry wire ) . It has been successfully carried in transport planes and it is planned to try dropping it from a plane with a giant parachute . <P> The jeep positively will not fly , but there is a widespread notion in the Army that it can do anything else . Last week in Washington there was a rumor that the midget was going to be equipped with 75-mm. guns . Since the jeep 's practical load limit is 800 lb. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3,900 . But it is steady as a mule under the recoil of a 37-mm. antitank gun . If , under stress , the jeep should turn over , it is a simple matter for a few soldiers to set it right side up again . <P> Some 2,500 jeeps are now in use . The Infantry and the Armored Force are each equipped with about a thousand , while the Cavalry and Field Artillery have another 400 . They are part of an original order for 4,500 , distributed among the Ford , American Bantam and Willys-Overland factories . Newest contract for 16,000 more is held by Willys-Overland , which is scheduled to deliver the goods in four or five months . Present plans call for 95 jeeps to each Infantry regiment . <P> The fame of the jeep has spread so far that the British , Dutch and Canadians are investigating it . Until the British began using jeeps in Africa , no foreign army had anything quite like it . But , in war or peace , the jeep appears to have a long future ahead of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural experts expect the jeep to be an invaluable asset to the farmer , and many a soldier is firmly determined to get one after the war , for his personal use . <P> Most common designation : " jeep , " an all-inclusive Army nickname for anything insignificant , from a raw draftee to a tiny observation plane .
