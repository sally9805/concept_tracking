A new , double-action vaccine that protects children against diphtheria and whooping cough at the same time was described at the Atlantic City meeting of the American Public Health Association last week . The vaccine , a combination of standard diphtheria toxoid and a new preparation containing the germs of whooping cough , was developed by Dr. Pearl Luella Kendrick of the Michigan State Department of Health . <P> So far , Dr. Kendrick and a group of Illinois health officials have tried the vac cine on several groups of children , whose ages ranged from six months to five years . None of them had vaccine sickness from combined doses . The diphtheria toxoid , of course , protected the children completely ; the newer pertussis vaccine reduced the usual number of cases of whooping cough , moderated the disease in children who were attacked .
