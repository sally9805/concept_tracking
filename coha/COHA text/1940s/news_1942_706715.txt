txt PresIdent Roosevelt , responsible sources revealed tonight , has prepared for issuance Monday the most drastic order affecting the everyday , life of Americans in the nine and a half years since he became President  --  a decree limiting all wages , salaries . and farm prices in the United States . At the same time the order , as presently drafted , will create an economic administrator to see that these and other policies to hold down the wartime cost of living are carried out . Wendell Willkie , Gov . Herbert IL Lehman of New York , and Bernard M. Baruch were among those mentioned as possibilities for the job . Voids an Act of Congress . Aside from its impact on every American , the order is deemed even by the President 's advisers who helped him draft it to be almost revolutionary because the farm price section will , in effect , set aside an act of congress  --  a provision of the price control act which specifically forbids any price ceilings on farm products at less than 110 per cent of parity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are below it The President will assert his wartime powers and duties are sufficient to justify such unprecedented action , to prevent a threatened runaway rise in the cost of living . Hits $75 and Under Level . As outlined by government officials who can not be quoted by name , the President 's action involves the fol. lowing : I. Wages  --  Defined as any work paid for by an hourly rate , or other personal compensation less than $75 per week . The President is expected to order that no wage rates be in. creased above their Jan. 1 , 1941 , level by more than the rise in the cost of living since ? then , which is roughly 15 per cent In the case of . persons working by the hour this will not . affect increased pay resulting from working more hours per week . It was understood that persons whose wages have increased more than 15 per cent since Jan. 1 , 1941 , would continue on the basis of such increased wages . 2 . Salaries between $75 per week and $7,500 per year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether these will be frozen at existing levels or permitted to increase with the same cost of living formula applied to wages . S. Salaries over ** in. creases . Freeze at Present Levels . 4 . Farm prices  --  To be frozen at existing levels for the time being , subject to probable revision later In the case of some products . Certain of the revisions , it was said , would be downward . These are the general policies scheduled to be enunciated in the order . Many details will be left to the administrator , including probably such questions as pay raises accompanying bona fide promotions . In some cases , - enforcement will be indirect . Income tax laws will be used particularly to back the President 's statement of what employers should do about wages . Make Evasion Expensive . By refusing employers the usual " business expense " deductions fog unauthorized wage increases , which would automatically increase the taxes of the employers , officials believe the government can make it too expensive to evade the wage policy . Most eimployers , as a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluntarily . The order is not expected to take any direct action on other cost-of  --  living angles , but the President is expected in his message to congress and radio address to the public to emphasize the supplemental need of more taxes , more war bond purchases , payment of debts , avoidance of hoarding , more rationing and similar measures . Any setting aside by executive Eat of the legislative props for farm prices might be expected to result in protests from the congressional Serra bloc and from additional members of congress concerned with the prerogatives of the three branches of government . It is apparently in an effort to forestall some of this criticism and to answer some of the objections in advance that Mr. Roosevelt is planning a message to congress before his ad. dress to the people Monday . Th1 message probably will constitute at explanation of the step  --  the Presl dent has said that it will not be f request for any legislation . It was recalled that when Mr ** sent his message to con cress in 1990 advising it of the des @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for outlying air an9 naval bases , he sent along simultane ously the opinion of former Attorne3 General Robert H. Jackson , now Supreme court justice , upholding his authority for the act . In that case , too , the President 's message consti tuted a report and an explanation to congress rather than a request foi any congressional action . Attorney General Francis Biddis and other justice department officials are known to have conferred al length with the President and his ad. visers in connection with the new anti inflation program . Recall Biddle 's Argument . In this connection some observers recalled as possibly significant a line of argument Biddle took before the special term of the Supreme court recently In opposing successfully the efforts of Nazi saboteurs to obtain writs of habeas corpus freeing them from the custody of a military com ? mission appointed by the President . The defense contended that certain phases of the President 's order establishing the commission violated a congressional enactment stipulating the manner in which military trials should be conducted . Biddle denied any violuIlon , but argued that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution vests In the President in time of war give the right to supersede an act of congress ; . If this contention is made by Biddle in connection with the anti-inflation program , the Supreme court 's formal opinion in the saboteurs ' case , forthcoming at the term starting next month , would be watched with additional interest . It Is entirely possible , however , that the court might not treat of this phase of the saboteurs ' case , or , if it does , the opinion may be held to have no bearing on the antiinflation program .
