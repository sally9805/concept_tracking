The American Mother is a perfectly wonderful woman , wrote Caf Columnist Paul V. Coates in the Los Angeles Mirror , but most of the time she is also a " perfectly lousy cook . " So why all this sentimental drivel about " Food Like Mother Used to Make ? " Give him a nightclub table any time and some breast of guinea hen . <P> For thus insulting Mom and Home Cooking , Columnist Coates last week was paying a heavy price . More than 260 readers had flooded the Mirror with letters challenging Coates to take potluck at their homes , and vowing to make him eat humble pie . A man with a cast-iron stomach and an eye for a circulation chart , Coates accepted most of the 260 invitations and offered prizes for the tastiest meals . <P> Hostess No. 1 was Mrs. Elizabeth LaPointe , a 56-year-old grandmother and telephone operator . The man who came to dinner sampled her fruit compote , eggs soaked in pickled beet juice , Norwegian meat sticks , Norwegian coffee , snowball cookies and cinnamon rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had let the lemon fluff collapse . Coates pronounced the LaPointe dinner " delicious . " <P> A few nights later , after downing four predinner shots of bourbon at a Syrian home , Coates danced the dubbke ( " No serious threat to the samba , " he told his readers ) . He put away exotic dishes ranging from kibbee ( lamb cake ) and yabrac ( grape leaves ) to baklawa ( pastry ) . <P> By week 's end , 32-year-old Paul Coates had gained five pounds . He had sampled Scotch haggis ( oatmeal and suet pudding ) , frankfurters &; sauerkraut , spareribs , and potato latkes ( pancakes ) , still had some 250 meals to go . A thoughtful reader had sent him a tin of baking soda , but Coates was no quitter . Gritted he : " I 'll follow through . "
