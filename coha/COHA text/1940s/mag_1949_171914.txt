In eight weeks , 99,029 Britons had trooped to see the evidence - 400-odd paintings and sculptures that the Royal Academy had bought &; paid for from the proceeds of the Chantrey Bequest ( TIME , Jan. 10 ) . Were they as good as the Academicians insisted ? Or did they belong back in the cellars of London 's Tate Gallery , from which they had been momentarily resurrected ? <P> By last week the critics stood withTate Director John Rothenstein-hanging was too good for most of the Chantreys . With Rothenstein they agreed that over the past 70 years of Chantrey buying , the Royal Academy selection committees had picked a high percentage of bad pictures and missed a lot of good ones . Wrote a Manchester Guardian Weekly critic : " Once the eye has been thoroughly glazed by the pompous onslaught of indomitable mediocrity , it is fascinating to wander limply through the galleries , no longer resisting ... " In the Spectator , Harold Nicolson suggested that a detailed , illustrated catalogue of the Chantrey purchases should be prepared ( in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decorate Makerere College in Uganda or the corridors of some Fijian veterinary school . " <P> Academy President ( and horse-painter ) Sir Alfred Munnings galloped to the defense of the Academy by attacking modernism : " The director of the Tate may be able to tell us why a painting of a head with two noses is better than the landlady 's favorite The Bath of Psyche , by Lord Leighton . " Old folks generally liked the paintings , too . Said one blackstocking : " They remind me of my youth . Besides , I know what the subject is meant to be . Ca n't do that with pictures nowadays . " Said another : " So frightfully British . . . and I do love the cows . " <P> But Director Rothenstein had made his point . The selection committees had purchased no Hogarths , Reynoldses , Gainsboroughs , Constables , Turners , Blakes or Lawrences . Among later artists , there were no canvases by Whistler or Rossetti-though there were a great many by Royal Academicians . This week , except for about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth looking at , the exhibit went back into deep freeze - Psyche and all .
