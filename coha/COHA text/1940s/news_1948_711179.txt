txt John L. Lewis must wait until court resumes at 10 a.m . April 19 to learn whether or not he is to be convicted of contempt for not stopping the coal strike " forthwith , " as the Government contends . Justice T. Alan Goldsborough announced the delay in rendering a verdict after listening to the Government 's summing up of its case against Mr. Lewis and the United Mine Workers of America . Mr. Lewis sat solemnly still as assistant United States Attorney General H. Graham Morison , making . the government 's final argument said , " It is a very grave matter we bring before the court . " The government 's chief counsel , a slim young man with a thin-timbre vioce , averred it was " crystal clear " that an April 3 court order directing Mr. Lewis to call off the strike " forthwith " was disobeyed . Contempt Charged Mr. Morison argued that testimony " points directly to the fact that these defendants did not co  --  nply with the order of this court and are guilty of criminal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered his miners to return to work April 12 ? nine clays after the court order was issued , and after he had won a settlement of the pension dispute which started the strike March 15 . But the Government contends that this order came too late to save Mr , Lewis and the UMW from contempt . Welly Hopkins , chief counsel for Mr. Lewis and the UMW , declined to offer any final argu-ment , The defense believes that the " abundantly clear record " failed to prove the Government charges , Mr , Hopkins said . Lewis Grimly Silent " The court thinks it would be helpful , " Judge Goldsborough had explained , - " to the court and in the public interest for both sides to present their case . " The judge then added almost hopefully , " If the defendant wishes to be heard at this time , the court will hear the defendant . " Mr. Lewis remained seated . an inscrutable frown clouding his impassive countenance . The crowd turned its gase on the defendant . Mr. Hopkins arose in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken as a whole , fails completely to establish a case of civil or criminal contempt , " he replied , He added that further response was unnecessary . The court . then recessed until April 19 , when Judge Golds-borough will hand down his verdict . Inside , press and spectators filling every available seat heard Mr. Morison review the now-familiar history of the pension dispute which set off the strike . He said the evidence " shows that the defendants took no action to comply with the order of the court until April 12 , 1948 , when they dispatched two telegrams to subordinate officials and local unions . " He said it was important for the court to remember that these telegrams were not sent until one week after the restraining order was served on Mr. Lewis . " The court ordered defendants on April 5 to act forthwith , " Mr. Morison said . " They did not act , but , in their own good time , took no action until April 12 . " Defendants have argued in their answer that there was no strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was signed and that therefore there was nothing to call off when they were served with the restraining order . Oral and documentary evidence , fresh in the minds of all , dissipates this argument completely and conclusively . " Affront ' Alleged Mr. Morison described the Marzh. 12 Lewis letter telling union locals that coal operators had " dishonored " their agreement as the " catalytic agent " which caused the strike . He said it was ' ' an affront to common sense " to deny that the work stoppage ' was a strike by the union . " It is taxing credulity to the breaking point to suggest that these men , so widely separated , would walk out by the hundreds of thousands in a welter of individual decisions . " Mr. Morison said . He then pointed to Mr. Lewis ' April 12 settlement announcement notifying the miners that the contract had been " honored . " He said it had " forever destroyed the fiction " which Mr. Lewis had tried to create " that he had not ordered a strike or made a strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued that the March 12 letter was sent by Mr. Lewis " with full knowledge of its effect .
