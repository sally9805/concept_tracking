txt Mrs. Ethel Epstein , wife of Henry Epstein , the Democratic candidate for Attorney General , was dismissed yesterday by Mayor La Guardia as his labor adviser . She charged at once that the Mayor had ousted her as an indirect blow at her husband . Mrs. Epstein said at her husband 's campaign headquarters in the Hotel Biltmore that she had been notified of her dismissal in a letter from the Mayor yesterday morning . She insisted that the Mayor , far from finding fault with her work , had increased her salary last July . The real reason behind his action in dismissing her , she said , was his inability to forget or forgive Mr. Epstein 's support of William O'Dwyer in the 1941 Mayoralty campaign . She said also that the Mayor , who is supporting Dean Alfange , American Labor party candidate for Governor , had blocked an A. L. P. endorsement for Mr. Epstein . Says Mayor Does Not Forgive In a radio address over WHN at 9 o'clock last night Mrs. Epstein repeated her charges , emphasizing that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused the Mayor of " spite " and said he had attempted to sabotage President Roosevelt 's efforts to elect the candidate of his party . " You will remember , of course , that Henry Epstein opposed the Mayor 's re-election in 1941 , " she said . " The Mayor is not the sort of man who will forgive or forget . The Mayor succeeded in forcing the American Labor party to find another candidate for Attorney General . But he could not stop the A. F. of L. and the C. I. 0 . from endorsing the candidacy of Henry Epstein . They knew his record on every labor question and they knew that the failure of the A. L. P. to nominate him was a political deal engineered by the Mayor . " It is difficult to believe that the Mayor 's spite , already vented against Henry in the pressure he put on the American Labor party . is not yet satisfied . It had to include my dismissal . " Throughout the campaign the Mayor has assiduously attempted to sabotage the President 's efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactionary , Dewey . This is a fact which the people of this city and State will have to recognize in evaluating correctly Mayor La Guardia 's conduct in this election . Charges Opposition to President " Although this is not the first evidence of the Mayor 's bitterness toward President Roosevelt , it is the most open and direct effort which the Mayor has made to oppose and frustrate the President . " It has become known about the city that the Mayor is determined to show , if possible , that he can do more for Alfange than President Roosevelt can for Bennett . How do the people of the city feel about that ? Are they for Roosevelt or are they for La Guardia ? How do Ithe working people feel about it ? Are they for Roosevelt and his support of John J. Bennett , or are they for La Guardia and his support of Dewey reaction through the pretense of supporting Alfange ? " I remember well the Mayor 's first administration , and it was good . I worked closely with him through his second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What a pity to see such a change in such a man ! But the war is more important than any quarrel that Mayor La Guardia may have with President Roosevelt , more important than the Mayor 's opposition to the New Deal program . And no matter what efforts the Mayor may make to interfere with the Roosevelt program , we must support the President in his choice of John J. Bennett for Governor .

Mayor La Guardia confirmed Mrs. Epstein 's departure from his office and said he had named Magistrate Edward C. Maguire as her successor . The magistrate will receive no pay as labor advisor . Mrs. Epstein 's Reply In reply to the Mayor , Mrs. Epstein wrote : Dear Mr. Mayor : This morning I received your letter telling me that my services in your office are at an end . It is with regret that thus involuntarily I end my six years of employment in the New York City administration . These past four years have witnessed the steady growth of confidence of trade unions in the office of the Mayor and an increased reliance by employers on the services of that office . You appreciate , I am sure , the greatly increased scope of our activity during the time that I have been your labor secretary .
