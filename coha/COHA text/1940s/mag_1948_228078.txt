" America 's Family Magazine " was out to raise a bigger family of readers . Last week , as a recruiting poster , Look ran a double helping of cheesecake on its cover : a hairy-chested youth and a golden-haired girl , lolling in bathing suits more fiction than fact . The whole magazine also had a new look . A new art director , Merle Armitage , had restyled the covers ( with a white background ) , cleaned up the cramped typography , and given the magazine a fresh , well-ventilated air . <P> Look had never looked so healthy , or been so prosperous . In the second quarter of 1948 it had sold a record $2,867,000 worth of ads , half again as much as last year . For the 13th quarter in a row , circulation was also up . With 2,910,104 ( up 361,000 in a year ) , the picture magazine had almost caught up to Collier 's ( see below ) , currently less than 14,000 ahead . <P> The publishing team responsible for Look 's success was President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fleur Fenton Cowles , 38 , associate editor . <P> Woman 's Angle . Mrs. Gowles won her reputation as a career girl before Look did . As a 16-year-old Bostonian with a gift of gab , she talked herself into a $100-a-week advertising job with Gimbels in Manhattan . By 1936 she had an advertising agency of her own and was making $20,000 a year . On Passport No. 1492 , she was the first U.S. businesswoman to visit Europe after V-E day . In 1946 she quit her agency to work with the Famine Emergency Committee . Nine months later she and Publisher " Mike " Cowles , friends since 1941 , were married ( he for the third time , she for the second ) . <P> <P> " I was mad about his mind , " said Fleur . The madness was mutual . Mike Cowles found that his bride had so many ideas for Look that he put her to work on it . She knew little about magazine editing but she knew what she liked-and thought other women would too . She added sections for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that every issue had " female appeal . " Look began capturing women readers . " Before , " says Fleur , " it was bought by two million men , and women read it sort of by inheritance . " <P> 32-Hour Day . In Look 's Fifth Avenue GHQ , the two have offices to match their personalities . Mike Cowles , deliberate , slow-spoken , has a sedate , paneled , 13th-floor office , a neat , clean desk . His wife 's , eight floors below , has bright lime-yellow walls , a royal blue rug and a littered blond mahogany semicircular desk . Fleur dresses dramatically , sports an uncut emerald ring as big as a horse chestnut , talks fast and crisply , smokes and likes Scotch &; soda . Both she and Mike wear black hornrimmed glasses . In their spare time , Mike plays tennis ( " enormously good , " says Fleur ) , while she paints . <P> But they have little spare time . Between them , the Cowleses figure they put in about 32 hours a day thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Fleur says , " are held in our library between 11:30 p.m. and 1:30 a.m. "
