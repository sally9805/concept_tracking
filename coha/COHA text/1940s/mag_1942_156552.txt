Amid the cheery bustle ushering in a new campus autumn the blow fell . Secretary of War Stimson told U.S. colleges that the Army had decided to take every able-bodied college man as soon as he reached draft age , even reservists who had been excused from active duty to continue their studies . His announcement , coupled with probable lowering of the draft age from 20 to 18 , seemed to many a college president a death sentence for colleges . <P> College presidents hastened to Washington for a confab . At Yale , Freshman James A. Atwood III went so far as to put in a phone call to the White House in a vain effort to find out where he stood . At Brown , balding President Henry Wriston denounced the Stimson decision as " a clear reversal of War Department policy . " Said Wriston : <P> " Ever since the advent of the crisis , public officials and military officers have directed at the colleges and their students a series of conflicting statements , warnings , threats . There have been almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicts of authority , clashes of personalities , lack of understanding ' in this matter as in the case of rubber . What is the remedy ? It is the same remedy that is now being tardily applied to the rubber problem-a single coherent policy . " <P> Unhappy college presidents last week would almost have welcomed a revival of World War I 's fumbling Students ' Army Training Corps . Despite its inefficiency , S.A.T.C. at least put the boys in uniform , gave them a definite job to do , saved colleges from bankruptcy ( by means of Government subsidy ) . Washington admits that by contrast it has vastly bungled the job this time . Typical bungles : <P> &gt; Undergraduates have been torn between hard choices : 1 ) to quit college and put on a uniform ; 2 ) to mark time in college while waiting for a commission . <P> &gt; They are under a dizzy recruiting barrage by at least five different groups : Army , Navy and Marine reserve units , War Manpower Commission , war industry . <P> &gt; Because reservists are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlistee knows whether he will be allowed to finish his studies-or be put in a job where he can use them . ( Adding to the confusion , the Navy last week said that for the time being it did not intend to follow the Army 's example in inducting reservists . ) Enlistments have been spotty , ranging from 75% of the undergraduates at Yale to 6% at N.Y.U. <P> &gt; Though the Government demands that colleges help train technical specialists for the Army , it has not backed up its demand with cash . <P> Secretary Stimson , riled by the criticisms of Brown 's Wriston et al. , retorted last week : " My statement . . . has been interpreted in some quarters to mean the end of all higher education for the duration of the war . This is a misapprehension . . . . It is hoped that colleges will maintain their training of students in engineering , medicine and other sciences . " Liberal arts colleges were more alarmed than ever . <P> Result of all this confusion is an estimated 20% drop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop last year . This has alarmed not only college presidents but the Army &; Navy , for U.S. undergraduates constitute their No. 1 pool of potential officers .
