Again &; again for the last six months , the scene has been repeated in war plants all over the country . <P> A tall , lumbering , grey-thatched man with a quizzical look and the three silver stars of a lieutenant general quietly strolls in . Quietly he walks up &; down the production lines , looking hard , saying little . Sometimes he stops , shows a workman how to handle a tool more smoothly . Sometimes he reroutes a whole line . He leaves without fuss , flies on to the next plant , the thanks of production bosses ringing after him . <P> Lieut . General William S. Knudsen is a happy man again . The Danish immigrant who rose to be production boss of General Motors but who , as half-boss of the ill-fated OPM , seemed to be a square head in a round hole , is working hard at a job he likes . He knows that what he does is worth while and is appreciated . <P> Lieut . General Knudsen started his tireless jaunt February i , three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army Production . He has been to 350 plants in nearly a hundred cities and towns ; he has flown 55,000 miles over the U.S. ; he has talked to thousands of Americans about their work . In six swift months Knudsen has had an experience that would make any land-conscious American poet desperately envious . No poet of words , he is the kind of American who fingers shiny , greasy machines with a conscious , tactile pleasure-and because he loves machines they seem to work well for him . <P> His trips have brought no revolutionary changes in production ; but in an hour 's visit he finds a dozen ways to save precious time and critical materials . Typical Knudsen touches : <P> A Southern shell plant had conveyor lines running lengthwise ; when shells reached the end of one line they had to be carted by truck to the start of the next line . Knudsen revised the lines , made one start where the other ended . Said he : " Now throw your trucks out the window . " <P> In an Ohio plant he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be made of steel instead . <P> There have been small changes . Multiplied in hundreds of plants , they are invaluable . Last week a telegram for Knudsen ticked in to the War Department 's Signal Office . It was from Nash-Kelvinator , now making airplane propellers : " Final production for July exceeded by more than 50% the figure for any previous month . This is a new high , a tribute to ' Knudsen month ' inaugurated by your recent visit . Kindest personal regards . "
