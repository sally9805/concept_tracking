txt WeSther , arbiter of military history , threatened tonight to influence the start of " the greatest field exercise the Army has ever staged , the biggest it probably ever will stage , " as a tropical storm curved in toward the Gulf coast . More than 450,000 men are- assembled and 1,000 planes of the Army , Navy and Marine Corps , two armored divisions , two cavalry divisions , parachute troops , tankdestroyer battalions and all the paraphernalia of modern war are ready for the " zero hour " which will initiate two weeks of the largest manoeuvres probably ever held in this or any other country . Arrayed through the rice fields , swamp lands and dry rolling ranges of the East Texas-Louisiana area and the slash pine forests that checkerboard the wild and difficult terrain were the Second and Third Armies of the United States . Lieut . Gen. Walter Krueger , commanding the Third Army , and Lieut . Gen. Ben Lear , commanding the Second Army , awaited from Army General Headquarters the order starting the war game . Zero Hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly any time after noon today , but the tropical storm which has been skittering about the Gulf of Mexico for the past few days was roaring toward the Texas coast and was expected to strike the bayou region anywhere between New Orleans and Galveston , with the center between Galveston and Port ' Arthur . The winds were not of extraordinary velocity ; on the storm 's fringes winds of only twenty-five to thirty miles were expected . But many of the 145 bombers and 167 pursuit ships of the Third Task Force , commanded by Major Gen. Herbert A. Dargue , which is acting Is air support command to the Third Army , were shifted , for safety , to airports farther inland and out of the storm 's path . The ceiling was expected to be below 1,000 feet in much of the manoeuvre- area through part of tomorrow and the lowering gray clouds with high humidity which characterized the Sunday-beforebattle were accompanied by gusty and fitful winds . Since the manoeuvres are intended as a training exercise in the coordination of all arms  --  particularly task and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes participate . Lieut . Gen. - Leasley J. , Chief of Staff of Army G. H. Q. and manoeuvre director , told 2,000 officer umpires yesterday that this manoeuvre , which " may be our last , " is a " test of tank warfare and anti-tank defense . " " We are definitely out to see , " he said , " if and how we can crush a modern tank offensive . " The Red , the Sabine and the Calcasieu Rivers are terrain obstacles of importance . The Red River , which now lies between the two opposing Armies , is expected to play an important part in the test . Troops to Have " Free " Scope The manoeuvres are intended to be the most realistic in our history . They will be as " free " as possible ; . that is , umpires will exercise no more control than is necessary to keep them from degenerating into a free-for-all scrap . General Krueger 's numerically superior Third Army  --  the " Army of the South " ? has somewhat less than 250,000 men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coast and to be acting as a covering force for other troops being pushed north behind them  --  their objective an advance up the Mississippi River to cut the Union in two . General Lear 's army of more than 100,000 men is a theoretical advance force of a defending army , which will try to push General Krueger into the sea . The manoeuvres will be conducted in phases , with pauses between each phase , and the two armored divisions and the parachute troops will be assigned first to one side , then to the other . In an interview with the " war correspondents " assigned to his Blue forces , General Krueger pointed to the tremendous problem of supply involved by the manoeuvres ( there are 40,000 motor vehicles in the Third Army alone ) , which has so far been successfully solved , praised the health of the troops and the medical facilities prepared from them and emphasized that the manoeuvres were for training purposes , particularly the training of the higher commands and staff in handling large numbers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
