The three latest fugitive bigwigs to be chased out of their country by the rolling swastika fled first last week to hard-pressed Athens , then to Jerusalem . They were 17-year-old King Peter of Yugo slavia , his 22-day Premier , General Dusan Simovitch , and Dr. Vladimir Matchek , Vice Premier and Croat Peasant Leader . They were 17-year-old King Peter of Yugo slavia , his 22-day Premier , General Dusan Simovitch , and Dr. Vladimir Matchek , Vice Premier and Croat Peasant Leader . About all they took with them was the grim satisfaction that Adolf Hitler will have a tough time making that hetero geneous land make sense . They knew because they had tried to . <P> In the partitioning of his new province on the Adriatic Sea , Hitler must consider as many as six claims . Even before the war had officially ended , the Axis jackals had begun to snarl over the latest spoils . <P> &gt; To Germany went the northwest province of Slovenia , which with its German minority had been until 1918 part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might get a share of territory in the north , east and south . <P> In gratitude for their pro-Axis campaign of terrorism . Hitler deeded to Croat extremists under Dr. Ante Pavelitch* a Croat State that will be about as free as the " independent " State of Slovakia . <P> What Italy would get remained a mystery . By her work in the war , she had earned nothing , but it seemed likely that for propaganda purposes Mussolini must be given something . While Virginio Gayda was pettishly scolding Swiss newspapers for belittling Italy 's contribution to the victory , Italian troops entered two South Dalmatian ports and the Roman press hopefully remembered Venetian colonies in Dalmatia 150 years ago . But Dalmatia , with its excellent Adriatic ports , belonged to Austria more recently and is a favorite German vacation resort . <P> What the Nazis planned for the stubborn Serbs they did not disclose . But whether there would be a puppet state or a new province of the Reich , it was certain that Germany 's hand would be heavy upon them because : 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ) Germany needs Serbia 's copper and foodstuffs . They would probably not get much food from Serbia this year , thanks to war damage and the dislocation of agriculture which the German push has caused in all Balkan countries . <P> In true Balkan fashion , one excitement was leading to another . As Yugo slavia fought its last battles , word came of border clashes between Rumania and Hungary over the portions of Transylvania handed to Hungary last year by the Axis , and of a threatened coup d ' tat in Rumania by the irascible Iron Guard . It looked as though Hitler was due to discover that even a smashing victory would not keep the Balkens quiet . <P> * Sentenced ( in absentia ) to death in France for instigating the assassination of King Alexander in Marseille in 1934 , Dr. Pavelitch will probably be pardoned . Last week , there was already a movement afoot to free three accomplices , now serving prison terms .                    @
