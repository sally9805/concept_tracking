During the ' 20s , when British Novelist Aldous Huxley was writing sexy , sophisticated novels ( Point Counter Point ) , the fashionable thing was humanistic materialism . By this week it was plain that the times and Author Huxley have changed : the new vogue is mysticism . <P> Mystic Huxley , for some years a resident of California and a latter-day disciple of California 's mystic Gerald Heard , has called his newest book The Perennial Philosophy ( Harper ; $3 ) . Under 27 headings , Author Huxley has presented the principal tenets of mysticism in his own words , illustrating by quotations from Mystics Eckhart , Lao-Tzu , William Law , many another . <P> But Huxley plainly intended his new book to be neither a show piece of erudition nor a collection of wise old sayings and bright young remarks . Instead , he designed it as a manual of man 's relationship to God , as stated by certain saints and mystics . How successfully this perennial philosophy gets across to the reader depends largely on the reader . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immanent and transcendent - the Whole of which all things , especially man , are a part ; 2 ) that man 's great potentiality and purpose to achieve a union with the Whole ; 3 ) that man can achieve such union only by ruthlessly eliminating all human desires and illusions of a separate self , letting the divine element work and grow within him . But self-improvement faddists looking for a 15-minute-a-day course to " happiness " need not apply . Sample Huxley dicta : <P> On Two Worlds . " The world inhabited by ordinary , nice unregenerate people is ... so dull that they have to distract their minds from being aware of it by all sorts of artificial ' amusements . ' . . . For those who have deserved the world by making themselves fit to see God within it as well as within their own souls , it wears a very different aspect . " <P> On Salvation . " For what is probably the majority of those who profess the great historical religions , Heaven signifies ... a happy posthumous condition of indefinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . and a compensation for the miseries inseparable from life in a body . But for those who . . . have accepted the Perennial Philosophy . . . ' heaven ' is not an exclusively posthumous condition . He only is completely ' saved ' who is delivered here and now .
