The impact of the Germans ' robomb blitz on the lives of London 's working people has not been told by the daily communiqu 's " Damage and casualties were caused . " This is the story told to TIME Correspondent Sherry Mangan by a London toolmaker in a defense plant . ( Place names are necessarily fictitious . ) <P> The factory went on holiday the 17th of June . I did n't want my holiday that week so I went on working . Alerts were steady and we were taking spells on the aircraft-spotting tower . Well , at one particular imminent-danger warning I was on the tower and over a flying bomb came . She missed and fell and I thought , " Christ , right smack on Hillford Garden , " - that 's where we live . So when the imminent passed I went to the gate and got on the phone to a neighbor and there was no answer . Just then a lorry pulled in and the driver said : " Do n't worry , Mate . I hear it was smack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pub -a good 300 yards away from my place . <P> I was just idling off when a fellow on a bike buzzed up . " I want you , " he said . " Your place has copped it . " He lent me the bike-decent bloke he was-and I burned up the main road toward home . Soon as I got near I could see it was close - crowds and the most awful bloody wreckage all over the lot , police lines streets away . ... I took a quick look . Our house was standing-well , more or less standing . But it was blitzed to bloody hell-the roof clean off , the windows and doors gone , the walls sagging . <P> Somebody standing about said she thought Kit was in the back garden so I slipped and slithered through the rubble to the back and there she was , with the kids , all alive . That was one good moment . It was bloody lucky you know . <P> Kit was wandering around the garden with a cloth to her mouth . She was bleeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and she was partly hysterical . And all the chickens were up in the trees flapping their wings which sort of added to the unreality . Paula , ( 10 ) , was quiet and subdued . Young Andrew , ( 3 ) , had a mouthful of dirt from the blast and was crying miserably . Funny about Andrew-he would n't go through the house to the street and for three days he howled if you took him near a house at all . <P> Off to Grandmother 's . I told young Paula to pack up whatever of her clothes she could find among the wreckage and push off to her grandmother 's place at Puddleston by herself and I told Kit to take the nipper to my mother 's at Ashmont . She did and I pitched in on the job of cleaning up the wreckage . . . some of the lads from the shop came to give a hand . <P> The big point was to get the junk off what furniture was n't smashed and patch the roof quick against rain . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some eight inches from the sidewalks so we could n't risk ladders . We had to climb the inner sidewall and snake a tarpaulin through , weight it and throw it over the front and back walls since you could n't stand on them . And you never knew when the floors would go . Yes it was a bit sticky , that .
