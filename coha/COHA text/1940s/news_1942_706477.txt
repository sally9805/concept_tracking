txt Noise Wardens Suggested When Mayor La Guardia ruled that automobiles could not remain parked all night along the streets here it served a double purpose . I hope this law will remain in effect after the war . Residents of this city can now obtain at least a few hours ' sleep without being startled out of their wits by auto horns and wheezing old motors missing fire . The blasting of auto horns , however , still is something that needs attention during these days of war nerves . Taxi drivers seem to have taken over the right of way and sound their horns for no good reason at all , trying to beat the light , rounding corners at high speed , rushing for fares or just breezing along Park Avenue . In addition , we have parked taxicabs with radios going full blast underneath one 's windows . It occurred to me that the average civilian hates unnecessary noise , but he ca n't do anything about it . He lacks authority . If we have air raid wardens doing their bit , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility toward the government of their own city . HOWARD J. BUTLER . New York , June 7 , 1942.
