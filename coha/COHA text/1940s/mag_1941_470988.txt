WHEN Marconi visited the Century of Progress exposition at Chicago in 1933 he spent a good deal of time at the amateur radio exhibit , admiring the equipment and genially passing out autographs to goggle-eyed fans . The father of radio explained to the manager of the RCA pavilion , who was frantically trying to draft him for the commercial show , " You know , I 've always considered myself an amateur . " Had Marconi been an American he would probably have called himself a " ham . " Commercial operators of the early wireless days applied the epithet contemptuously to the non-commercial fraternity , and it stuck . But any sense of disparagement which it might once have conveyed disappeared with the First World War . When we entered that conflict there were about 6,000 hams in the country , and 3,500 of them were soon serving as radio operators or signal officers in the armed services . To-day the federal government has licensed 60,000 amateurs , among whom you will find some of the fastest and smoothest radio operators in the world . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those charged with the responsibility for national defense . In these times of air power , panzer thrusts , and highly motorized battalions , with radio the only possible means of contact among units , the potential value of a big reservoir of civilian radio-communications talent can hardly be overestimated . Of course in normal times the public knows little about that aspect of amateur activity and cares less . And , partly because the amateurs are clannish , the public knows a lot about them that just is n't so . To the average citizen the ham is still a small boy given to tinkering with radio in such a manner as to break into a Town Hall program with " CQ , CQ , calling CQ , " or superimpose a staccato of clicks and buzzes on the pianissimo passages of Beethoven 's Fifth . The picture is inaccurate : the average age of the contemporary ham is about thirty , and ninety-five per cent of the interference he is blamed for comes from other sources . But it is true that he tinkers and experiments . So does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would n't have a broadcast receiver in your home . Even the commercial radio people will tell you that the hams have contributed substantially to the technic which makes the wheels go round . And , while lending a hand in the creation of the farflung communication and entertainment facilities of the modern world , they have simultaneously built up a telegraph and telephone network all their own , which tides over many an emergency until the regular machinery is functioning again . That again is something which the average comfortable citizen does not think of every day ? but he thinks of it when flood , quake , fire , hurricane , or snow strikes swift and hard . But to consider the ham only as a technician would be to neglect the social and political significance of his collective personality . He has given us an example of twentieth-century pioneering which would be hard to match in any other field , and a striking demonstration of the compatibility of individual enterprise with group purpose . And he has done this principally in America , because here he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never thrived in countries where freedom is regarded , in Signor Mussolini 's elegant phrase , as a putrefying corpse . Even before the present World War the totalitarian states had largely regulated their amateurs from the international ether . Amateur radio thus serves as a kind of international barometer of civil liberties . It is only in the Western Hemisphere , and particularly in the United States , that the ham is afforded facilities in the way of power and wave-length assignments adequate for serious experimentation and the pursuit of amateur happiness . Consequently over eighty per cent of the world 's hams are Americans , united in the closest approach to a perfect democracy that exists . They are found in every walk of life , from college professors to orchestra leaders ( Andy Senella and Raymond Page are hams ) , to garage mechanics , aviators ( the late Frank Hawks was a radio amateur ) , WPA workers and millionaires , to radio engineers and professional radio and wire operators on a perennial busman 's holiday . Amos ' n ' Andy , farmers , baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Presidents ' sons ( Herbert Hoover , Jr. ) , bell hops , and even authors are among the rank and file of amateur-dom . Radio is the only thing they have in common ; their interest in radio is the bond that unites them over the breadth of continents and ? less and less as the war spreads ? across the seas . Many of them have been on the air for years and never meet in the fifsh . When they come face to face the rssults are sometimes interesting . A group of Florida amateurs were visiting Orlando , and it occurred to them to drop in on a friend they had " worked " many timesin the Florida State net . Night had fallen by the time they found his residence , and the house was uninvitingly dark . Reconnaissance to the rear disclosed no light . Without much expectation of finding anyone at home , they rang the doorbell . Footsteps caught them just as they were turning away and the door swung open . Their friend welcomed them . " Come on in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some lights . " He led the way up a flight of stairs , turning on lights as he went , and then down a long hall to a blacked-out " shack . " ( The radio room is the shack , whether it be a corner in the parlor , bedroom , kitchen , attic , cellar ? or actually a separate building . ) The pungent odor of melted rosin hung in the darkness , and , as the host once more switched on lights , a ribbon of smoke curled up from a hot soldering iron . " I was just working on the rig , " the hana explained . Then they all remembered ? W4DWI is blind . There is no physical handicap , other than total deafness , that precludes ham operation . Hundreds of amateurs are shut-ins , many of them bedridden , where the movement of a hand across the counterpane spans distances unlimited . II Distances were not so unlimited in the pioneer days of the wireless art , just after the turn of the century , when Number One Ham Marconi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitators among the boy-electricians of the time . George Clark ? pioneer ham , RCA engineer and publicity specialist for three deeades ? records what hap-pened : ? with a footnote , " G. Marconi worked 1800 miles ; G. Clark , 200 feet . " Two hundred feet was pretty good . Any reception was an event in those days . All that was known about Marconi 's detecting device ? the " coherer " ? was that it contained metal filings in a glass tube . The amateur filed down a nickel and a dime to make such a gadget , with the net result that he was out fifteen cents . Even after the crystal detector was invented it took years before the simple details of its construction got round , mostly by word of mouth , and the amateurs made it their own . Those who could not obtain a sensitive piece of silicon or carborundum rummaged in the coal bin and after interminable trials occasionally discovered a piece of anthracite that would pick up the longed-for dots and dashes . But transmitters were few and far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precarious state of adjustment , nobody was sending , and when somebody was sending the chances were the detector was out of kilter . " I heard a station last night , " was a claim that might or might not be believed . It was not until the close of the century 's first decade that the hams , using spark coils for transmitting and improved crystal detectors for receiving , were " getting out " over distances of several miles . And it was then that they had their first brush with people who did n't like them ? the first of a long series . Ex-ham Jack Binns had just transmitted his immortal CQD ( the SOS of that day ) , saving several hundred lives on the S.S. Republic . Wireless ( or radio ? they 're both the same ) was beginning to be appreciated in the shipping business and in naval communication . The great problem was interference . Tuning , if any , was broad , and the operators were getting in one another 's way . The ether was a frontier , anarchic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept appointments on New York 's West Street docks to settle with their fists arguments that had started with a " jamming " incident during a voyage . But the hams were the greatest pest of all . Radio law did not exist . If you wanted to put up a station and transmit you asked leave of no one . You planted yourself on any wave length , usually with only the vaguest idea of what it was , and not giving a hoot anyway . Call letters were self-assigned generally the initials of the station owner . If you jammed someone he swore at you ? there were no regulations regarding the " transmission of obscene language " and you returned the compliment . There existed no official distinction between ham and commercial stations . There was E. N. Pickerell ( ex-ham , later Chief Operator on the S.S. Leviathan , still later in charge of aviation radio for RCA ) who operated WA , pioneer commercial station at the Waldorf Astoria . Every time Pickerell would open up , W. E. D. Stokes , Jr. , who owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile away , " sat on the key " ? with the approval of his millionaire father , who owned the latter hotel . A ham might heed the request of a commercial operator to lay off , or he might ? and frequently did ? tell the commercial station to go to hell . The resulting resentment gradually converged on Washington , D. C. When President Taft signed the Alexander Bill , on August 17 , 1912 , the frontier days of radio were over . This bill provided for the licensing of all stations and operators , limited the ham to 1,000 watts of power , and relegated him to the 200-meter wave length , then considered worthless for communication purposes . It was expected that in the course of a few years he would quietly expire . ( Since then he has circled the globe on less than one watt of power and on still shorter , more " worthless , " wave lengths ! ) But the ham survived in spite of the lawmakers . Among other things , what kept him alive was his natural tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common interest . As the number of hams increased they began to form a kind of scientific fraternity from which the social and mouetary criteria of the outside world were tacitly barred . In New York City , the boys of the Bronx , using homemade condensers coated with tinfoil still redolent of Liederkranz cheese , compared notes over the air with the affluent amateurs of the West Side ? five miles distant , geographically , but a social light-year removed . The social gulf did not exist so far as ham radio was concerned , but superior financial underwriting did enable the West Side hams to erect bigger and better stations and thus speed up technical progress . In 1909 they formed the Junior Wireless Club , Ltd. ? later the Radio Club of America ? and held meetings at the Hotel Ansonia , with the aforementioned W. E. D. Stokes , Jr. , as president . One member of the club was a lad named Armstrong , with a penchant for pole-sitting . Atop a 150-foot antenna mast at his Yonkers home , young Armstrong would sway precariously in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooed him down . Armstrong was only nineteen years of age when , with both feet on the ground , he discovered that he could do remarkable things with the audion ( your radio tube of to-day ) invented by pioneer ham Lee DeForest in 1906 . In the course of the next decade the DeForest and Armstrong circuits revolutionized the entire radio art , especially communication on the short wave lengths to which the amateurs were confined . It was a decade and a half later that Armstrong again went in for pole-sitting . The " pole " this time was one of the hundred-foot towers of WJZ on the roof of the old Aeolian Hall , on West 42nd Street , New York City . He was Major Armstrong by then . To make the pole act more interesting , he did it in the dark of night and stood on his head on top of the strap-iron ball that crowned the tower . For this feat he was permanently barred from the premises by ex-ham , ex-commercial operator David Sarnoff , President of RCA . Armstrong 's originality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invented Frequency Modulation , which gives every sign of revolutionizing radio broadcasting as we now know it , and he made a profitable dicker with RCA subsidiaries . To-day Armstrong ? now Professor Armstrong ? climbs the towers of his FM transmitter at Alpine , N. J. There is nothing phony about those pictures you see of him silhouetted against the sky ? and no one can shoo him down . About the time that the Radio Club of America was founded the ham was combining , first into neighborhood groups or local clubs , then on a nation-wide scale . In 1915 the American Radio Relay League came into being under the organizational guidance of ham Hiram Percy Maxim , inventor of the Maxim silencer and pioneer in amateur radio and the development of the automobile . The idea of relaying messages over distances which could not be spanned by a single station proved to be the integrative force the amateurs needed . Distance has always had its lure , and it provided the incentive for the amateur to improve his equipment and his operating ability . In January , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same year the United States entered the First World War , and the U. S. Naval District Communications Superintendents sent out peremptory orders to all amateurs to close their stations , sending and receiving ; to lower antennas to the ground , and to disconnect the apparatus . Two hundred meters was silent . But it came back strong as soon as the ban was lifted . The termination of the War brought a new era in radio . It marked the beginning of the end for the old spark transmitter , particularly prized by the amateur for its pyrotechnics , the ozone it generated , the lights it dimmed for blocks around , and the byproduct of sound which drove the neighbors crazy and raised the belligerence of landlords to the boiling point . But long before the government forbade these high-voltage fireworks the hams recognized the superior efficiency of tube transmitters and voluntarily forsook their daily Fourth-of-July celebration for the tube circuits invented by DeForest and Armstrong , which made long-distance transmission possible and radio telephony practicable . Tubes were hard to get in the early twenties . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotch . But no one who really wanted a drink went without one , and prohibition actually helped the amateurs obtain their tubes . One of the authors of this article owned the second tube transmitter in New York City . The ham is proud of his equipment ? regardless of how " haywire " it may be ? and hospitable by tradition and instinct . So when a stranger knocked at the door of the shack one day he was made welcome , and the blue glow of the Western Electric tubes was pridefully displayed . The stranger 's interest in the tubes was gratifying indeed until he flashed a gold badge identifying himself as a member of the secret service ? the FBI of those days . He was checking inventory for the Navy on the complaint that a flock of tubes disappeared every time the fleet anchored in the Hudson River . This was before the days of Alcatraz , but Atlanta was in existence , and the ham 's story was that he had bought the tubes from someone ? he could n't recall the name ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ham stuck to his story ? and the federal man departed with the tubes . A hurried call was made to a neighboring ham before the fleet sailed for winter maneuvers off Guantanamo . " Get hold of the operator on board the Shawmut . Tell him 2PI needs a couple of VT-2 's and three VT-1 's . Same price ? two quarts of gin for the lot . " The amateurs were the first broadcast audience . Experimental radio telephony was nothing new . Professor ( ex-ham ) Fessenden had broadcast a Christmas Eve program back in 1906 with " Silent Night , Holy Night " and " Adeste Fidelis . " DeForest in 1912 had broadcast the Metropolitan Opera . But these were pioneer efforts before there was even a potential audience , and they made history rather than entertainment . Shortly after the War , DeForest put on regular shows , phonograph records , and variety with well-known vaudeville stars , from his stations at Highbridge and Ossining , N. Y. And then there was Frank Conrad , Assistant Chief Engineer of the Westinghouse Company , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending out phonograph music from his ham station in Pittsburgh in 1919 . By this time there were several thousand amateurs who listened , and when not occupied with the serious business of communicating in code they shared the entertainment with relatives and friends . An almost fatal error ! The layman discovered that there was something on the air besides dots and dashes . The idea of hearing voice and music ? regardless of quality ? without benefit of wires had a distinct novelty appeal . People began to ask if they could obtain receiving sets of their own , and the hams obligingly built a few . A Pittsburgh department store laid in a stock of simple receivers which anybody could operate , and the public made a rush for them . It caught on like Mah Jongg ? but never petered out . Conrad 's 8XK was moved to the Westinghouse plant , where it became KDKA . The company began manufacturing radios on a production basis , and the broadcasting boom roared over the nation . Thereupon the hams , who had let the camel into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered in those days were of inferior design ? inferior even to the earlier ham models from which they were copied . They were incapable of separating one station from another , and actually transmitted whistles and bloops which were blamed on amateur interference , along with every other kind of noise from X-ray machines to sparking elevator motors and atmospheric static . The hams had had few dealings with humanity in the mass , and what they knew about coils and condensers was of no assistance in their public relations . Reacting from their first baffled astonishment , they began hitting back . A first-class row was in the making ? reminiscent of the commercial-ham fracas of two decades back ? with the lunatic fringe on both sides sounding off loudly and more loudly . One irate broadcast listener proclaimed , " If that is the station that is broadcasting code , my suggestion would be that instead of hiring a lawyer , the matter be placed in the hands of a vigilance committee for action ! " At about the same time a prominent ham wrote , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say I hope the amateur may see the day when he can tramp on the grave of the nighthawk broadcaster , and kick his tombstone into perdition beyond recall . " III The quarrel was ended without serious casualties , but even to-day the ham is blamed by the radio listener , whom he warmed at his breast , for most of the latter 's woes ? those natural concomitants of radio reception , fading and atmospheric static , plus the noise-making by-products of modern civilization : neon lights , diathermy machines , automobile-ignition systems , traffic lights , any kind of a light flasher , thermostats ( for goldfish bowls or oil heating ) , incinerators , smoke precipitators , electric shavers , fluorescent lights , ultra-violet ray machines , and even trouble within the radio itself . Actually , the amateur is strictly required by law to operate his equipment in such a manner that it will interfere with no other service ? and he does . If you are bothered with strange radio noises call in a radio serviceman ? do n't bother the local radio inspector or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's unsavory reputation is partially legend ? a hangover from the wild and woolly days of wireless , and another is that most broadcast listeners are introduced to him through the back door of amateur radio , the " 160-meter fone band , " close to the State police and high-fidelity broadcast channels . Here the opinion one receives of the ham is truly sad . He appears to be a moron broadcasting his idiotic jargon on a spectrum of the ether that might be used for better purposes . This , however , does not present a fair picture of ham radio . The least experienced and lowliest amateurs gravitate to this band because of government restrictions and natural limitations . Only amateurs possessing the highest of the three grades of government licenses are permitted to operate fone on the more desirable ham bands , and many of those lacking the IQ to pass the relatively rigid examination for the Class A ticket continue to display their limitations on 160 meters . But the jargon of the ham is no index to his mentality , ability , or justification for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , when only code transmission was possible and every word had to be spelled out , not only by letters , but by the dots and dashes composing the letters . Abbreviations were essential . Many were borrowed from Morse land-line practice and a comprehensive list of international " Q-signals " developed . In telephone transmission they have only a ritualistic value ? the abracadabra of the initiate ? and the fone hams cling to them for precisely this reason . Instead of " go ahead " they say " K. " Signing-off is done with " SK " ? the radio code equivalent of Morse " 30 , " the venerable adieu of the press wires . A " QSO " is a contact ? a complete interchange of communications with another station . " Hi " indicates laughter , the four dots ( h ) followed by a space and two dots ( i ) having a mildly risible lilt in code . QRM and QRN are respectively interference and static . The expression " 73 " is another dating back to the old Morse days : it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 88 " is used to send " love and kisses . " " OM " and " OB " do duty respectively as " old man " and " old boy . " The original feminine counterpart " OW " ( " old woman " ) was quickly shelved as soon as a few girl operators appeared on the scene , giving place to the more chivalrous " YL " - " young lady " ? applied without regard to age . When she marries even an Indian child marriage ? a " YL " becomes an " XYL " ? " ex-young Iady . " " DX " means distance . The most prevalent abbreviation of all is " CQ . " This is the mating call of the ham , both telephone and telegraph ? a general call signifying to all within range that the operator is lonely , that he desires contact with another station ? any station . It is not , as so many broadcast listeners have assumed , the call-letters of the most popular ham station on the air . The amateurs operate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compete seriously with commercial communication facilities , does carry a considerable volume of traffic . Amateur messages are usually delivered by mail or telephone , with the statement that a reply filed with the delivering station will be transmitted free of charge . The delivery of 200 to 300 messages a month by a single station is by no means unusual . The cost of mailing and telephoning messages is a part of the ham 's not inconsiderable overhead . He welcomes this expense and bother because he enjoys what he is doing and takes pride in handling traffic with increasing speed and accuracy . And then , his wave lengths are precious to him , his hold on them precarious ? and he is not unmindful of the value of the public 's good will . Most amateur traffic is of a trivial nature ? birthday and Christmas greetings where the recipient is not worth even a one-and-a-half-cent stamp , routine good wishes , and declarations by the sender that he or she will write soon . Occasionally the content announces sick-ness , birth , death , departures , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sender evidently being too broke to write . Train and hotel accommodations are often reserved by ham radio . In the preparation of this article , with the co-authors separated by the width of the continent , messages filed in New York State reached Hollywood in a few hours , and replies were forwarded with the same expedition . Thousands of messages originate at fairs , and practically every exposition provides facilities for notifying the people at home that you are having a swell time , weather is fine , and wish you were here . Some 23,000 such messages were transmitted from the New York World 's Fair station W2USA . The ham station at the Florida State Fair gets rid of 4,000 in two weeks . Messages between government outposts such as the Philippines , the Panama Canal , Puerto Rico , Guam , Hawaii , and the States arc , as a rule , of more consequence . The elapsed time is usually better than air mail , and Army officers , enlisted men , and their families often avail themselves of ham radio facilities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that Federal monitoring stations had plenty of time to ply their direction finders and apprehend the operator . Army-amateur stations in most of the training camps substitute for delinquent post cards between draftees and home . An amateur in Tampa , Florida , not so long ago was asked by a station north of the Mason and Dixon Line if he could deliver a message to a passenger aboard the Silver Meteor before the train was shuttled to its ultimate destination , St. Petersburg . The ham said he 'd try to get away from work the following afternoon when the streamliner pulled in , and ZOT ( go ahead and transmit ) the message . The text ? jusx TO RELIEVE YOUR MIND NELLIE IS FEELING MUCH BETTER LovE ? seemed reasonably urgent , so the ham knocked off at three o'clock ( losing a half day 's pay ) and was on the platform when the Meteor snaked its way round Ybor City . He tipped a porter to page the addressee , who shortly appeared ? one of these elderly perennials who occupy the green benches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiles , he asked the ham what he owed him , and when the amateur said " Nothing , " he tried to press a ten-cent tip into his palm . This too the ham refused ; amateurs are not permitted to accept compensation , direct or indirect , for their services . The old gentleman made up for it with his thanks . " I could n't sleep last night , " he said , " worrying about Nellie . My daughter fed her potatoes , which everyone should know is indigestible for dogs . " Any ham will take a message from you , and if it is handled through the well-integrated and disciplined network of the Army Amateur Radio System , or the reasonably dependable facilities of the American Radio Relay League , it will probably get through . However , the reliability of the amateur system is not always on a par with the instance of the potato-eating Nellie . There is the case of a message sent from Hawaii to a relative in Texas , announcing the birth of a baby boy . A return radiogram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WANTED STOP I AM DELIGHTED The reply to this message came by clipper in the form of a wrathful demand for explanation . It developed that one of the receiving operators , unable to cope with static , inteference , or quality of transmission , had written DISGUSTED instead of DELIGHTED . And then there was the ham who balled up the name CATHERINE ( who was " feeling fine " ) with the result that it was copied as CATHETER . IV All of this is a lot of fun for the participants , but the reader has a right to ask for a critical audit of what the amateur receives from society and what of fundamental value he gives in return . MAGAZINE What he receives can be summed up in a very few words . He is granted a little more than five per cent of the wave lengths useful for general communications purposes , as compared with the fifteen to twenty per cent occupied by the broadcasting stations . He is permitted to transmit with a power which , although small , is adequate for his purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests in code , radio theory , international agreements , and radio law . To insure compliance with the regulations , his signals are checked by twenty-six offices and seven monitoring stations of the Federal Communications Commission . The other side of the balance sheet will require considerably more space . We have already outlined the ham 's services in the development of the radio art . But he does much more than this . Sometimes he saves lives . Out on the lonely island of San Nicholas , seventy miles west of Los Angeles harbor light , a baby was dying . On the island , inhabited by only a few sheep ranchers , no expert medical aid was available , and the child 's parents sat throughout a night of agony , pinning their hopes on a miracle . Late the previous afternoon the one San Nicholas ham station , W6JLF , had sent through an urgent CQ to Los Angeles , through a station at Redondo Beach . The receiving amateur notified the Redondo Beach Police , who in turn passed on the emergency message to the Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to the home of Dr. William E. Brown , picked him up with his medical kit , and screeched harborward . Coast Guard Patrol No. 259 cast off its ropes as Dr. Brown leaped aboard , and in the dawn the boat hove to in the lee of San Nicholas . Two hours later the doctor pronounced the child out of danger . The heroic role of individual amateurs in disasters is old stuff to most of the public and more or less taken for granted . But few people know of the magnitude of the group effort and the elaborate organization behind it . In the New England-Long Island hurricane of 1938 the Army Amateur Radio System alone handled more than 8,000 messages dealing with emergency relief . " Acts of God " first lay low the relatively vulnerable telegraph and telephone wires and poles , disrupting wire communications . There remains only radio ? mostly ham radio . For although police radio , forestry stations , and special emergency stations exist , it is impossible to place these in predetermined strategic positions , whereas the amateur is ubiquitous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistling through some ham antenna . About 2,600 amateurs are organized by the American Radio Relay League into an emergency corps , which in times of disaster works in prearranged co-operation with the Red Cross , National Guard units , and municipal and State police . All members of the Army Amateur Radio System , the NCR ( Naval Communication Reserve ) and the National Guard ( whose radio equipment , incidentally , is manned by hams ) automatically become available as emergency stations . About forty per cent of these are capable of operation from power plants independent of the light lines , and many of them have apparatus , including power supply , which can be moved to the most advantageous location in an afflicted zone . Special tests are made several times a year ? preparedness drills which are essentially sham battles with hurricane and flood . Ever since Donald B. MacMillan took Donald H. Mix , 1TS , on his Arctic expedition aboard the Bowdoin in 1923 , explorations and similar ventures have depended wholly or partially on amateur radio to keep in touch with civilization ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expeditionary personnel and in dependence upon amateur stations as points of contact . The dirigible Shenandoah on a countrywide cruise worked with hams in thirty-nine States , and her ultimate breakup in midair has been attributed to the abandoning of such contacts , which might have warned her of the storm in which she met her doom . Together with the Bowdoin , the schooner Morrissey of the American Museum Greenland Expedition , commanded by Bob Bartlett , bruised her bows against the Arctic ice for a decade and , through the hams , was never out of touch with home . Amateur radio has been with Byrd on every one of his expeditions , with Wilkins and the Southern Cross on her flight from California to Australia , with MetroGoldwyn-Mayer in the filming of " Trader Horn " in Africa , " Eskimo " in Alaska , and other pictures . Ham radio cooperated with Wilkins and Ellsworth aboard the submarine Nautilus , accompanied the Wyatt Antarctic expedition , the Bol-Inca expedition , and was with one of the present writers on the first land-plane circumnavigatory flight of South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bermuda . The government in recognition of the hams ' potential utility makes every effort to train them through the Army Amateur Radio System and the Naval Communications Reserve , and these efforts are now being accelerated for emergency purposes . The Chief Signal Officer of the Army is directly responsible to the President of the United States for the administration of the AARS . He is assisted by a " Liaison Officer AARS " and a " Chief Radio Aide , " the latter usually being a prominent civilian radio amateur . The Army Signal Officer in each Corps Area carries out the plan of coordination between the Signal Corps and the ham members in that area . While many of the AARS operators are officers in the Signal Corps Reserve , in the AARS itself no military service of any kind is required or expected . The main idea is to make an expert of the ham in code work and army procedure . The NCR is more closely affiliated with the Navy than the AARS is with our land forces ; it is , in effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? to improve the operating ability of its members , and to familiarize them with the procedure of traffic handling , which , incidentally , is entirely different in the two services . These very real achievements of the hams in national defense have unfortunately been obscured of late by the agitation over real or fancied Fifth Column activities . Privately owned radio stations obviously offer possibilities for assistance in espionage ? a fact that has long been recognized by the dictator governments and by the writers of international spy yarns . No amateur transmitters are permitted to-day in any of the belligerent nations , and the American ham has felt the pressure of war ever since Poland was invaded . At that time he was warned by the Federal Communications Commission and the ARRL to watch his step , express no partiality over the air , and deport himself generally so that our neutrality would in no way be jeopardized . Sharper restrictions were imposed last year when the United States discarded its winter coat of neutrality for the spring apparel of nonbelligerent aid to the Allies . The ham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Western Hemisphere , and to converse in any language other than English . More recently the use of portable and mobile equipment has been restricted , and all operators , commercial and amateur , are fingerprinted and must definitely establish their citizenship . These precautions , however , should not be allowed to cast suspicion on the hams as a group . There is not the slightest ground for suspecting bona fide American amateurs of Fifth Column activity . It is much more likely that treasonable communications would be carried on through unlicensed and illegal stations , and that the American ham will be of material service in detecting and locating them . It is worth noting that long before General Mola coined the Fifth Column phrase , operators ' licenses were issued only to American citizens , and no one , not even a citizen , could secure a station license for a transmitter located on premises under alien control . Should the United States definitely enter this war , our government might follow the example of the other belligerents and stop all amateur operation . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amateur stations might be allowed to continue operation , as well as universities , National Guard amateur transmitters , and certain other stations . This would promote the further training of non-enlisted operators . Then again , while wars are man-made and man-timed , floods and hurricanes come and go as they please , war or no war . The ham already has shined up the dimming tradition of the first World War . The War Department recently announced , " The matter of utilizing amateur radio stations for national defense purposes is under study by the Defense Communications Board at the present time . " On the first of August , 1941 , there were close to 10,000 hams in the U. S. armed services . The Selective Service questionnaire filled out by every draftee asks him only two questions in reference to special qualifications ? one of these : Is radio your hobby ? Army amateur draftees , by order of the Chief Signal Officer , are automatically inducted into the Signal Corps . Hams in general are sifted to fill radio needs in other branches of the services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort Leonard Wood , says , " From my own standpoint , I should be only too glad to have my radio section filled with amateurs . " An ensign , instructor at the Navy 's largest radio training school , wishes that the entire student body were made up of hams . There exists to-day a definite shortage of maritime radio operators ? owing to enlistment and draft and by the commissioning of all available ships . To meet this emergency , the U. S. Maritime Commission has set up a of the group effort and the elaborate organization behind it . In the New England-Long Island hurricane of 1938 the Army Amateur Radio System alone handled more than 8,000 messages dealing with emergency relief . " Acts of God " first lay low the relatively vulnerable telegraph and telephone wires and poles , disrupting wire communications . There remains only radio ? mostly ham radio . For although police radio , forestry stations , and special emergency stations exist , it is impossible to place these in predetermined strategic positions , whereas the amateur is ubiquitous . Wherever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ham antenna . About 2,600 amateurs are organized by the American Radio Relay League into an emergency corps , which in times of disaster works in prearranged co-operation with the Red Cross , National Guard units , and municipal and State police . All members of the Army Amateur Radio System , the NCR ( Naval Communication Reserve ) and the National Guard ( whose radio equipment , incidentally , is manned by hams ) automatically become available as emergency stations . About forty per cent of these are capable of operation from power plants independent of the light lines , and many of them have apparatus , including power supply , which can be moved to the most advantageous location in an afflicted zone . Special tests are made several times a year ? preparedness drills which are essentially sham battles with hurricane and flood . Ever since Donald B. MacMillan took Donald H. Mix , 1TS , on his Arctic expedition aboard the Bowdoin in 1923 , explorations and similar ventures have depended wholly or partially on amateur radio to keep in touch with civilization ? both in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in dependence upon amateur stations as points of contact . The dirigible Shenandoah on a countrywide cruise worked with hams in thirty-nine States , and her ultimate breakup in midair has been attributed to the abandoning of such contacts , which might have warned her of the storm in which she met her doom . Together with the Bowdoin , the schooner Morrissey of the American Museum Greenland Expedition , commanded by Bob Bartlett , bruised her bows against the Arctic ice for a decade and , through the hams , was never out of touch with home . Amateur radio has been with Byrd on every one of his expeditions , with Wilkins and the Southern Cross on her flight from California to Australia , with MetroGoldwyn-Mayer in the filming of " Trader Horn " in Africa , " Eskimo " in Alaska , and other pictures . Ham radio cooperated with Wilkins and Ellsworth aboard the submarine Nautilus , accompanied the Wyatt Antarctic expedition , the Bol-Inca expedition , and was with one of the present writers on the first land-plane circumnavigatory flight of South America and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The government in recognition of the hams ' potential utility makes every effort to train them through the Army Amateur Radio System and the Naval Communications Reserve , and these efforts are now being accelerated for emergency purposes . The Chief Signal Officer of the Army is directly responsible to the President of the United States for the administration of the AARS . He is assisted by a " Liaison Officer AARS " and a " Chief Radio Aide , " the latter usually being a prominent civilian radio amateur . The Army Signal Officer in each Corps Area carries out the plan of coordination between the Signal Corps and the ham members in that area . While many of the AARS operators are officers in the Signal Corps Reserve , in the AARS itself no military service of any kind is required or expected . The main idea is to make an expert of the ham in code work and army procedure . The NCR is more closely affiliated with the Navy than the AARS is with our land forces           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
