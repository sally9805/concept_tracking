The talks , ? like those made on Sunday afternoons by the . late Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia , will be carried by WNYC , the municipal station , but details have not , been worked out . The Mayor said he expected to be on the air for half an hour once a month , but that he would speak Imore frequently if he felt that the people . were not getting accurate information on the city 's business . " I have no feud with the newspapers , but I have a responsibility to explain matters to the people , " the Mayor told City Hall reporters , 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are newspapers and newspapers . I may from time to time correct misinformation that some newspapers have given in the past , particularly during the campaign . " I shall continue to be frank with the newspapers ; but if they distort the facts ? as some of them have done  --  the people are entitled to know the truth . That wo n't be done with the intent of feuding with newspapers as such . " Asserting that in an editorial after election one newspaper had declared " with great pontification " that it would support him if and when he was right , the Mayor said , " I might be compelled from time to time to let the people be the judge of when I 'm right , rather than let any newspaper make that decision . " The Mayor was asked if he tended to hold out news items for use in his radio broadcasts . He did n't reply directly but said , " I have a responsibility to the people to see that they are accurately informed independently of private media .

" The people are entitled to know as much as we can give them in the way of information . " Mindful of the fact that once in ' 1945 , during a newspaper delivery strike , Mayor La Guardia gave a highly dramatic reading of the Sunday comics on his broadcast , a reporter asked Mr. O'Dwyer if he intended to read the comics . The Mayor puffed on his pipe a moment and then replied , " I would n't be surprised if the people would enjoy what I have to say , sometimes . " Mr. La Guardia began his weekly talks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harbor . He continued them until Mayor O'Dwyer took office , on Jan. 1 , 1946 . The talks covered ? a variety of subjects and attracted a wide audience . In mellow moments the , late Mayor might give a new recipe for spaghetti or beef goulash . At other times , in his high-pitched tones , he would unleash bitter attacks on " tin-horn gamblers " and plead with dice-players and horse bettors to break themselves of " this terrible , terrible habit . " During the press conference yesterday Mayor O'Dwyer 's attention was directed to a newspaper story to the effect that the municipal transit system appeared to be facing an operating deficit for the current fiscal year . He was asked if the city planned to raise bus fares to 10 cents . " The question has n't come up yet and I do n't expect it to come up , " the Mayor answered . ?

The Mayor said he had instructed Corporation Counsel John P. to defend the law as a friend of the court . " Our position is positive , " he said . " We 're up there ( in Albany ) to support the bill as far as we can . We shall await a decision on it for further action and there is no comment on further action . "
