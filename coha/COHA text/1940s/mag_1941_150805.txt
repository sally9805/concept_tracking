<P> No U.S. Secretary of War in 75 years has faced such a situation as Henry Lewis Stimson faced last week . He had 1,500,000 soldiers under arms and many of them wanted to go home at a time when he was sure that they were desperately needed . <P> When the House of Representatives by a one-vote margin told draftees and guardsmen that they would have to serve 18 months longer than they expected , dissatisfaction in the ranks was bound to reach its worst . In that crisis Henry Stimson proved he lacked neither energy nor courage . <P> The night after the service-extension bill was passed he went on the air to broadcast a message to the Army : <P> " I realize that this the extension bill means sacrifice on your part . . . . The world is today facing a situation which is more dangerous to its general peace than any situation which has existed during all the years of recorded history . . . . Today these three Axis nations , Germany , Japan and Italy , openly announce their intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Our own hemisphere , thinly populated , rich beyond all other continents in natural resources , is an inevitable ultimate target for these marauder nations . " <P> Man of Logic . If these reasonable words did not bring soldiers to toss their hats in air and give a rousing cheer , no one had cause to be surprised . For the quality of Henry Stimson is to persuade rather than to rouse . His lack of success at rabble-rousing was demonstrated 31 years ago , in 1910 , when Theodore Roosevelt , just returned from Africa , picked Henry Stimson , the crack U.S. Attorney in New York City , to run for Governor of New York . Banking heavily on Henry Stimson 's record as buster of the sugar trust , successful prosecutor of the famed market manipulator , Charles W. Morse , T. R. called on New York to rally behind young " Harry " Stimson . He might as well have referred publicly to Charles Evans Hughes as " Spike . " On the stump high-collared Henry Stimson spoke as he did in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the time came to tear into Tammany mugs he politely " begged to differ with them . " The result was inevitable : a Democratic landslide . <P> The incidental effect of that landslide was significant . It launched the political career of a young Harvardman who was to learn how to appeal to crowds : in it Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt won a seat in the State Legislature . <P> Today if the rank &; file of the Army is to be roused to a patriotic fervor . Franklin Roosevelt rather than Henry Stimson will have to do the rousing . But good morale is composed of many things besides fervor , and in all these things Henry Stimson is effectively busy . <P> Work Done . Besides the conviction that danger to the U.S. is real , one thing that will help to restore Army morale is more equipment . Another thing is better officers . Henry Stimson is making progress on both fronts . The equipment is being built , incompetent officers are being weeded out . And the consensus of high Army officers is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Army , Henry Stimson has been a cracking good Secretary of War .
