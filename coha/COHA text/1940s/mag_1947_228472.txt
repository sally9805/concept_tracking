A month ago , concerned over reports from Greece , Secretary of State George Marshall secretly sent a special envoy to make an appraisal . The man he sent was Major General Stephen Chamberlin , the War Department 's Director of Intelligence . Last week , General Chamberlin was back . His report , in a nutshell : the U.S. experiment in Greece-the first application of the Truman Doctrine-is going very badly . <P> The failure could be put down to two main causes : 1 ) the appalling weakness of the Greek Army ; 2 ) a personal feud between the two equal U.S. plenipotentiaries in Athens , Ambassador Lincoln MacVeagh and Dwight Griswold , special head of the U.S. mission . <P> The entire Greek Army now consists of only a little more than nine divisions . General Chamberlin , who was Douglas MacArthur 's wartime operations officer , found that even under the most favorable conditions it would take the Army a year to regain mastery of northern Greece , which is at the mercy of the guerrillas . <P> General Chamberlin , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military aid at least to the point of assigning U.S. officers as advisers to Greek division commanders , and 2 ) abolish the special mission to Greece and concentrate the entire U.S. effort under one man . As between MacVeagh and Griswold , General Chamberlin recommended MacVeagh.
