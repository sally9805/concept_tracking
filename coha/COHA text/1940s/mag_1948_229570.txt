Ike said no . <P> The renunciation was almost without precedent in U.S. political history . For months the Eisenhower star had risen steadily in the public-opinion polls . As a potential Republican nominee , he was the only candidate in sight who seemed to have a sure chance of beating President Harry Truman . But last week General Ike abruptly took himself out of the race . <P> He did it in an 802-word letter to Leonard V. Finder , a New Hampshire newspaper publisher , who had urged Ike to accept a draft call . Though it took him 790 words more than General William Tecumseh Sherman , Ike was just as unequivocal . He wrote : " My decision to remove myself completely from the political scene is definite and positive . . . . I could not accept nomination even under the remote circumstance that it were tendered me . " <P> Why had he waited so long to say it ? For two reasons , Eisenhower explained . One was the fear that " such an expression would smack of effrontery . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which calls upon every good citizen to place no limitations upon his readiness to serve in any designated capacity . " <P> But now Eisenhower was convinced that " unless an individual feels some inner compulsion and special qualifications to enter the political arena , which I do not , a refusal to do so involves no violation of the highest standards of devotion to duty . . . . It would seem almost superfluous for me to add that as long as I live I shall hold myself in instant readiness to respond to any call by the Government to military duty . " <P> Confusion . The announcement threw Eisenhower 's mushrooming supporters into instant confusion. * In Manhattan , the national headquarters of the Draft Eisenhower League retired to think things over . In Chicago the news arrived just in time to interrupt a press conference announcing the merger of two Eisenhower clubs . <P> The first instinct of most Eisenhower backers was simply not to believe it . But Newsman Roy Roberts , an early Eisenhower booster who had predicted Ike 's withdrawal just two days before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a Page One story in his Kansas City Star , he wrote : " Too many did n't believe it when Ike Eisenhower said he did n't want to be President . He did n't , and does n't . He was n't politicking or trying to egg on the demand . " <P> Roberts was also one of the first to try to explain why Ike had done it : " Innately , he felt his career already had reached a climax when he received the surrender of the Hitler armies in Europe . . . . Anything after that , even the presidency , would be anticlimactic. "
