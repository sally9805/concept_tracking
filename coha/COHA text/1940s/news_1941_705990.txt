txt PATERNALISM : Not Prosperity It may be well to keep in mind the fact that the apparent prosperity of the past few years has been the result of enormous spending of public money by the government at Washing-ton and the consequent spending ability of those millions of citizens who have been receiving substantial checks from Washington . By this spending of many billions of dollars tl , e army of unemployed has been considerably reduced , but had it not been for this favor of a paternalistic government the number of unemployed would doubtless have reached twenty million by this time . For neither President Hoover nor President Roosevelt took any steps whatsoever in line with the principles of political economy to correct the causes of industrial depression and so to liberate those natural forces which always work for prosperity . Laissez-faire does not mean " hands off " of a bad system of government ; it means the democratic plan of removing artificial obstructions so that natural law may be permitted to exercise itself for the public good. ?
