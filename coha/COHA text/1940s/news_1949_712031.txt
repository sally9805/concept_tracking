txt WASHINGTON , May ** first United States negotiator of the North Atlantic defensive treaty interpreted it today as offering to its European members no absolute and unconditional ? guarantee of instant American action even if they were invaded in force . Robert A. Lovett , former UnderSecretary of State , who began the conversations that led to the covenant 's signature by the twelve countries , gave to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee substantially this view of the-obligations it would impose . He stressed that these obligations were . real and heavy ones . However , he expressed the opinion that in any eventuality  --  including , for example , a major Russian invasion of Norway  --  the United States was not committed as to the " time , way and method " that it would act . Mr. Lovett appeared on - this point- to depart from the spirit of the opinion given earlier to the committee by Dean Acheson , Secretary of State , who actually brought the treaty to completion . Confronted last week with the same hypothetical question as to what this country 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that making war could be its only answer . He suggested in effect that the moral commitment in this case would to him be clear , even though he had said many times that the treaty reserved to each of its members the right to determine its action if one of its partners were assaulted . Mr. Lovett , for his part , emphasized that he was not a lawyer and thus felt some hesitancy in speaking about points that had legal and constitutional aspects . He said under questioning by Senators Forrest C. Donnell of Missouri and Arthur V. Watkins of Utah , Republicans , that he doubted that expeditionary forces could be sent to the rescue of any invaded country unless Congress had declared war . " Suppose , " asked Mr. Donnell , " that 500,000 Russians attacked Norway . Would it be necessary that Congress be consulted before // the President , acting under the obligations of the treaty , could send American troops to Norway ? " " The President , " Mr. Lovett replied , " would have to consult Congress before there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligation of the pact  --  that an attack upon one is to be regarded as an attack upon all  --  give the President the same power to act as though the attack had been made on the United States itself ? " asked Senator Donnell . " It would not , " Mr. Lovett said . " Then , if Congress were in recess , any action toward sending troops would have to wait till Congress was convened ? " Mr. Donnell inquired . Mr. Lovett said that he " assumed " there would be an " emergency " session of Congress in such a case . " You think , " Mr. Donnell went on , " that the President could not send troops to Norway until Congress had declared war ? " " Yes , " replied Mr. Lovett , " but I am not a lawyer . " Senators Donnell and Watkins have been taking a strongly critical tone toward the treaty , which the committee is examining preparatory to recommending its ratification by the Senate . Ratifica , tion would require a two-thirds ' majority . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of State : " Does n't the treaty bind us to consider an attack on London the same as if our own country had been attacked ? " ' No , sir , " responded Mr. Lovett , " it does not . " Congress Held Not Bound " Does n't it actually bind Congress , in effect , to take the same steps as it would take if our own territory were attacked , and to proceed in the same way ? " " No , sir , that is not my understanding , " Mr. Lovett replied . " I do not think , " he added , " that , Article V ( in which the treaty declares that an armed attack against one of the members ' shall ' , be considered an attack upon them all ' ) gives any assurance that the line of action we take must be identical with the line we would take in case of an attack at home . " " Have n't we in effect created , in advance , a situation which as a matter of practical operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war if any treaty member were attacked ? " asked Mr. Watkins . " No , " Mr. Lovett said . " I ca n't agree that that was the intention . " Mr. Acheson had emphasized that the decision to go to war remained one for " the constitutidnal. authorities . " The chief difference in his testimony from that of Mr : Lovett was that he indicated , in the matter of the Donnell hypothesis of a Russian invasion of Norway , that so far as he was concerned there could be no question of weighing the timing or nature of American action in any such circumstance . He was not asked , in this connection , to go precisely or exhaustively into the question as to how a state of American belligerency should be brought about . In his direct statement to the committee appealing for Senate ratification of the treaty , Mr. Lovett asserted , in an obvious reference to the current easing of East-West tension over Berlin : " Recent events have only deepened my conviction that this treaty reflects the basic interests of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with any foreign power will not succeed in diverting our attention from these basic interests .
