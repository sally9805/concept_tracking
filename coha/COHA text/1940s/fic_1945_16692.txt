1 EXT . THE ENCHANTED COTTAGE - VERY LATE AFTERNOON FADE IN LONG SHOT . The season is mid-winter and it is already completely dark . DISSOLVE 2 INT . LIVING ROOM - THE ENCHANTED COTTAGE It is warm and cozy in this living room . Its only illumination comes from a lamp on the piano , plus the dancing light from a crackling log fire . Two men  --  Hillgrove and Oliver , are in the room . Hillgrove , having finished a few last notes on the piano , swings around on the piano bench , so that his back is to the piano . Oliver , in the shadows , his features not seen , is comfortably settled on a sofa , a few feet away . &nbsp; HILLGROVEYou know , Oliver , if I had any real courage  --  or maybe if I were a coward , it 's very often the same thing , they tell me  - -  -  ( pauses ) I 'm not sure I 'd play my little composition for you and Laura at all . &nbsp; BRADFORDIf I believed you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) And why would n't you play it for us , if I may be so bold ? &nbsp; HILLGROVEI do n't see how I can be doing justice to my theme . For instance  --  well , the very walls of this cottage  - -  -  I 'm going to try to show people they 're not walls at all  - -  -  that in a certain sense they 're magic . And that the air you breathe here , you and Laura , it is n't just air  --  it 's something only certain people can breathe fully , blessed people , because the cottage is enchanted and only those  --   --  2  --  ( lightly ) You can see it 's a bit hard to put it into music , ca n't you ? As he says this he gets up and makes his way , a shade uncertainly , as a blind man does , to a nearby end-table on which there are cigarettes and matches . He lights a cigarette and returns to the piano bench . Oliver , throughout this part , pays no particular attention to Hillgrove 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted fact . &nbsp; BRADFORDI know you 've done it . &nbsp; HILLGROVEThanks . I 'm hoping after you 've heard it , you 'll still -- - He is now back at the piano bench . &nbsp; HILLGROVEOliver , I 've given recitals all over the country , but I must say , this is really something unusual . ( gestures with his head toward the staircase ) Waiting for half your audience to come back from putting her baby to sleep . 3 INT . NURSERY - FORMERLY LAURA 'S BEDROOM There is no light in this nursery , because a young child has just been put to bed . His mother  --  Laura  --  alongside his crib , finishes her lullaby , leans over softly to make sure he is asleep , kisses him gently on the forehead , and leaves the room silently . ( The thin moonlight coming through the window has served to show the sleeping child . Laura is simply a figure . Her features  --  though the audience must not know what it 's being deprived of  --  are not seen. ) 4 INT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second floor directly into the living room . 5 INT . LIVING ROOM Hillgrove simply looks up as he hears her coming down the stairs . Oliver , as she approaches , rises to his feet .  --  3  --  &nbsp; PENNINGTON ( as she comes into the room ) He 's really the best boy that ever was . Went right to sleep . She walks over to Oliver , who puts his arm tenderly around her as they sit on the sofa . &nbsp; PENNINGTONNow ! &nbsp; HILLGROVE ( not seriously , striking a chord on the piano ) You sure you really want me to play it for you ? &nbsp; BRADFORDYou do n't leave this room alive until we 've heard it . &nbsp; HILLGROVEWell , if you 're going to force me  --  He swings around , as if addressing an audience . &nbsp; HILLGROVELady and gentleman  --  the first performance anywhere of " The Enchanted Cottage , " a tone poem for orchestra and piano , by John Hillgrove . Mr. Hillgrove  --  yes , the Mr. Hillgrove himself  --  is at the piano . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) He 's becoming quite an important pianist , you know , Oliver . Why according to some music critics  --  &nbsp; BRADFORDShhh ! Must n't disturb the artist . &nbsp; HILLGROVE ( starting to play , a few words after the opening of his speech ) In a true sense , you two have had as much to do with composing this , as I have . &nbsp; BRADFORDTrying to place the blame elsewhere in advance , are you ?  --  4  --  &nbsp; HILLGROVEBecause it 's really your story , your poem  --  and I know I 'd never have been able to set all this ( he gestures toward the walls ) to music , if you had n't supplied the theme , the notes and the chords of flesh and blood . Because from the day I first became aware of " The Enchanted Cottage "  --  in the twilight  --  I sensed its inherent magic . I longed to tell its story in music . DISSOLVE 6 EXT . COTTAGE - TWILIGHT CLOSEUP of a beautiful old arch windows . THE CAMERA FULLS BACK and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of an old ruined house . The floor plan of the wrecked dwelling is still extant , marked by the ruined walls and chimneys overgrown with ivy and wild flowers . It is the end of a summer day . The CAMERA PICKS UP a trail of a rambler rose that has wound up the arch window , AND TRAVELS WITH the rambler over the ruins to the cottage . The cottage had obviously once been a wing of the manor house itself , and now , left in this solitary state , it has a curious disproportion . Its fireplace chimney is huge ; its roof , strangely slanting , steeply pitched ; its front window , strikingly large . As Hillgrove 's narration continues , the CAMERA HAS FOLLOWED the rosevine TO the cottage , and then PULLED BACK until we get a VERY LONG SHOT of the cottage , with the New England shoreline and sea in the f.g . &nbsp; HILLGROVE 'S VOICENo place has ever had  --  could ever have had  --  a more enchanting legend . Here it was  --  all that remained of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English Nobleman , come to live out his life on these New England shores . The house had burned , but its plan was still marked by the crumbling walls , over-grown now with moss and ivy , wild roses and forest violets . Miraculously , one wing had been saved from the flames  --  the kitchen wing . It had been remodeled , and the nobleman used to lend it to young married couples to live in as long as they wished . But by the time I first saw it , this gracious tradition was abandoned and almost completely forgotten . The present day owner , I had learned , was a lone widow , who kept her distance  --  and made others keep theirs . DISSOLVE OUT DISSOLVE IN  --  5  --  7 EXT . SEASHORE - DAY SHOT of Hillgrove , his small nephew Johnny , and the dog Danny , as they pause on the shore . There is a high bank over them . Hillgrove stands immobile , the sea wind blowing his hair . His attitude is one of listening . &nbsp; HILLGROVE 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nephew walk me to where I could stand and try to sense the rapture of the love behind those walls . Those things mean music . But it continued to elude me . The CAMERA PULLS OUT GRADUALLY AWAY FROM them until the sea is in the f.g . At the end of this bit of Hillgrove 's narrative , a huge wave breaks in front of the camera DISSOLVING the scene . DISSOLVE 8 EXT . COTTAGE - DAY LONG SHOT of the cottage . It is winter now . The flowers and vines that had covered the ruins are gone . The foliage from the birch trees has fallen . A wind is blowing , and a few leaves fall listlessly in the air . In the far distance is the sound of churchbells ringing . &nbsp; HILLGROVE 'S VOICEIt was not until that wintry Sunday morning  --  bitter cold it was , remember , Laura ?  --  when you rode to the cottage on your bicycle , that I began to feel perhaps the meaning of this strange enchantment would not continue to elude me forever . DISSOLVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rides along , the CAMERA EXAMINING MORE CLOSELY the details of her physical appearance . Laura rides up in front of the broken wall of the cottage . 10 EXT . ROAD AND COTTAGE - DAY SHOT of Laura as she kicks the upright rest on the bicycle into place , so that the bike stands by itself . Then , as she passes through the open gateway entrance , she becomes aware of a young boy  --  Hillgrove 's nephew , Johnny Stanton , shown in Scene 7  --  stealthily making his way toward the front door , on tiptoes . ( He is bundled up in a mackinaw , a scarf and mittens . Laura , too , has protected herself against the cold . ) He becomes aware that someone is behind him , and turns , startled .  --  6  --  &nbsp; HILLGROVE ( as he sees Laura ) Oh ! &nbsp; PENNINGTONHello , Johnny . &nbsp; HILLGROVE ( aware that he needs an excuse ) Hello . I  --  I was just  --  I was just taking a walk . Laura smiles at him curiously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ever gets to see her or anything  --  well , I thought I 'd kinda find out myself about the witch . &nbsp; PENNINGTONWhat witch ? &nbsp; HILLGROVE ( thumbing toward the front door ) In there . &nbsp; PENNINGTONJohnny , that 's just Mrs. Minnett who lives there  --  and you know it . I 'm calling on her myself . You do n't think I 'd go calling on a witch ? &nbsp; HILLGROVEWell , everybody says  --  &nbsp; PENNINGTONI 'm afraid you 're just a couple of hundred years too late for witches , Johnny . &nbsp; HILLGROVE ( sadly ) I guess I 'm a couple of hundred years too late for anything . There 's no buffaloes anymore  --  or Indians , anyway , scalping Indians  --  or sailing ships  --  or  --  &nbsp; PENNINGTONI would n't worry , Johnny . Something will turn up .  --  7  --  &nbsp; HILLGROVEYou really think so ? Laura nods reassuringly . &nbsp; O.S. VOICETaxi ! Taxi ! Johnny turns in the direction of the voice and Laura follows his gaze . There , at the gateway entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( to Laura ) My Uncle John calls me Taxi  --  so excuse me , will you ? I got to catch my fare . Hillgrove has heard the sound of the voices and looks toward them . &nbsp; HILLGROVEWhom are you talking to , Johnny ? &nbsp; HILLGROVE ( not quite knowing how to make the introduction ) This is  - -  - this is my Uncle John . And this is Miss Pennington . &nbsp; HILLGROVEI 'm John Hillgrove . &nbsp; PENNINGTONHow do you do ? &nbsp; HILLGROVEI hope Johnny has n't been up to anything  --  he should n't be up to . &nbsp; PENNINGTON ( with a smiling look at Johnny ) Not a thing . &nbsp; HILLGROVE ( mouthing , but not pronouncing the words ) Thanks ! Thanks a lot ! &nbsp; HILLGROVEI 'm staying in the village with Dr. Stanton , my brother-in-law , for a bit  --  and when Johnny and I take a walk , there 's frequently a little confusion as to who 's responsible for whom .  --  8  --  &nbsp; HILLGROVEUncle John is a great pianist . He plays the piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your enthusiasm , if only you were a paying audience . Good-bye , Miss Pennington . Nice to have met you . &nbsp; PENNINGTONGood-bye , Mr. Hillgrove . As if it were a part of an established routine , Johnny places himself easily alongside Hillgrove . Hillgrove puts his hand lightly on Johnny 's shoulder and they walk up the path toward the gateway . Laura watches them go for a moment , then herself continues on toward the door of the cottage . As Hillgrove and Johnny get to the gateway , they stop for a moment . &nbsp; HILLGROVEYour friend Miss Pennington , has a very pleasant voice , Johnny . &nbsp; HILLGROVEYeah ! Only  - -  -  well , there is this you do n't know , Uncle John . She 's terrible homely . &nbsp; HILLGROVEThat 's not nice , Johnny . &nbsp; HILLGROVEDo n't you always say to me I should always tell the truth ? And do n't Ma ? And do n't Pa ? You just ca n't please people . Hillgrove smiles affectionately and squeezes the boy 's shoulders slightly . &nbsp; HILLGROVEThere 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; HILLGROVEIf you say so , Uncle John . ( pauses ) But she is homely . 1  --  8  --  Section Details 11 EXT . COTTAGE DOOR - DAY Laura , at the door , stands irresolute for a moment , apparently trying to decide something , then she squares her shoulders a bit , lifts the knocker and lets it fall .  --  9  --  A moment later , as she is removing the gloves from her hands , the door is thrown open and Mrs. Minnett appears on the threshold . For a second she stares at Laura , as if considering denying her admittance . Then a slight change comes into her eyes , as Laura smiles timidly . &nbsp; PENNINGTONI 'm Laura Pennington . My landlady said you wanted to see me , Mrs. Minnett . &nbsp; MRS . MINNETTCome in . She stands aside to let Laura enter the cottage , then follows her , closing the door behind her . 12 INT . COTTAGE HALLWAY - DAY Mrs. Minnett pauses at the living room entrance and turns back to Laura . &nbsp; MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . I 'll get some hot water for tea . &nbsp; PENNINGTONThank you . Mrs. Minnett continues on down the hallway , disappearing within the kitchen . The moment she is out of sight , most of her timidity and nervousness leaves Laura . Eagerly , and full of anticipation , she enters the living room . 13 INT . COTTAGE LIVING ROOM - DAY Laura comes down into the room , looking about her with unconcealed curiosity . This , the main room of the cottage , is not just an ordinary New England parlor . It was once the kitchen of the old manor house , but it has been remodeled into the living room . There is a large fireplace , with a fire glowing on the hearth , and near the front window , a small square piano . There are two windows  --  a large one which overlooks the garden , and a mullioned one , below which is a wide window seat . In the b.g. we see into the entrance hallway , and look directly onto a staircase , which leads up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laura hesitates , a pleased look on her face . Here is a place where she belongs , here is a room that is after her own quiet heart . She takes off her wraps , and places them neatly on a chair . She hears Mrs. Minnett returning with the hot water , and with a nervous start , turns quickly around to greet Mrs. Minnett . Mrs. Minnett is carrying a china teapot filled with hot water . Laura comes forward quickly to assist her . Mrs. Minnett , however , shakes her head , and herself pours the hot water into the waiting earthenware teapot . She indicates that Laura is to sit down in the chair opposite her . Laura sits a little stiffly in the chair , while Mrs. Minnett , across from her , fixes the tea things . &nbsp; MRS . MINNETTHow do you like your tea ? &nbsp; PENNINGTONOne lump , please . No milk . Mrs. Minnett hands Laura her cup , then pours her own . She takes a sip . A smile of pleasure lights her face , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Laura and comes directly to the point . &nbsp; MRS . MINNETTI understand you 're looking for a job . &nbsp; PENNINGTONYes , I am . I suppose I 'm really looking for a home . &nbsp; MRS . MINNETTI need a young woman to help me . Someone who does n't cling to the foolish belief that this cottage is  --  ( abruptly ) What do you think of this cottage ? &nbsp; PENNINGTON ( unprepared for the question , confused ) Why , it 's  --  it 's  - -   - -  -  &nbsp; MRS . MINNETT ( interrupting ) It 's not haunted . You know that , do n't you ? It 's not haunted . &nbsp; PENNINGTON ( smiling ) I 'm sure that  - -  -  well , when people say haunted , they do n't really mean that  --   --  11  --  &nbsp; MRS . MINNETTYou 're not superstitious . That 's good . ( pauses ) You just came back to Eastwood a few weeks ago , did n't you ? &nbsp; PENNINGTONThe beginning of December . &nbsp; MRS . MINNETTThings did n't work out with your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there really was n't enough for her and her family , let alone  --  &nbsp; MRS . MINNETTThere are some that are meant to be wanderers , and others  --  it 's no good for them to go looking for things . How long since you 've been away ? Seven years ? &nbsp; PENNINGTON ( half to herself ) Nearly eight . When my mother died there was n't anybody left here that  --  I belonged to  --  &nbsp; MRS . MINNETTI thought when you went away you 'd come back . &nbsp; PENNINGTONI hoped back here , where I grew up , I might find  --  I do n't know really what it was I wanted to find  --  a place I belonged , I guess , and  --  someplace that when I woke up there in the morning , I 'd be glad it was another day  --  and when I went to sleep , I 'd know It had meant something to have been awake . &nbsp; MRS . MINNETTYou 're young , at least  --  you can hope . ( pauses ) I 've rented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work . The people are coming again today to look at it . They want it for several months , with a housekeeper and maid . That 's us.  --  12  --  &nbsp; PENNINGTONIf you really want me , I 'd be glad  --  &nbsp; MRS . MINNETTThe work wo n't be hard . You 'll get your room and board  --  and ten dollars a week . &nbsp; PENNINGTONThat 's quite satisfactory . &nbsp; MRS . MINNETT ( rising ) Then we 'd better get started . They 'll be here directly . You can get your things later . Laura sets down her cup , rises , and follows Mrs. Minnett . &nbsp; PENNINGTONThere is n't very much to get , really . DISSOLVE  --  12  --  14 INT . COTTAGE LIVING ROOM - DAY FULL SHOT . The room is immaculate now , beautifully dusted and swept . Mrs. Minnett , her hair hidden by a dusting cap , is just concluding sweeping the hearth clean with a besom . She puts the besom aside , picks up a dusting cloth , and begins to dust the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both Laura and Mrs. Minnett wear white aprons . Laura is very happy in her new work . &nbsp; PENNINGTONThese people who are renting the cottage  --  are they a honeymoon couple ? &nbsp; MRS . MINNETT ( shortly ) Did n't ask . &nbsp; PENNINGTONI was hoping you were going to renew the old tradition , Mrs. Minnett . &nbsp; MRS . MINNETTWhat old tradition ?  --  13  --  &nbsp; PENNINGTONWhy , the one about this cottage . How for over a century it was rented , to honeymooners . &nbsp; MRS . MINNETTThat tradition is broken . ( pauses ) I broke it . &nbsp; PENNINGTON ( unable to suppress her reaction ) Oh ! &nbsp; MRS . MINNETTThis cottage was deeded to my husband as a wedding present . It was to have been our home  --  ( bitterly ) Tom 's and mine . Only I 've had to stay on here alone . Nearly twenty-five years that  --  ( interrupts herself ) You know what loneliness is , do n't you ? Real loneliness ? &nbsp; PENNINGTONYes ! &nbsp; MRS . MINNETTI thought you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  She leaves her sentence unfinished . After a quick look at her , Laura continues with the chrysanthemums . Mrs. Minnett returns to her dusting . O.s. is heard the sound of a car driving up and stopping .  --  13  --  15 MRS MINNETT MOVES QUICKLY TO THE WINDOW AND PEERS OUT SHOOTING OVER her shoulder , we see , outside , a large , expensive convertible in front of the cottage . A man is helping a woman out of the car . &nbsp; MRS . MINNETTThey 're here ! You open the door for them . She gathers the dustcloths and besom in hand , and vanishes into the hallway toward the kitchen . Laura quickly sticks the remaining chrysanthemums in the vase and starts with them to the piano , but she gets only half way across the room , when the knocker falls loudly . She is undecided for a moment .  --  14  --  &nbsp; PENNINGTON ( hurrying on toward the piano with the chrysanthemums ) Come in ! 16 INT . COTTAGE HALLWAY - DAY The door opens and Oliver Bradford and Beatrice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , followed by Beatrice , goes to the living room threshold and peers into the room . &nbsp; BRADFORDHello ? Anybody home ? He turns as he detects movement in the room . Section Details 17 INT . COTTAGE LIVING ROOM - DAY Laura has just put the vase down on the piano , but she is concealed by the huge satiny blossoms . &nbsp; PENNINGTONCome in , please . Oliver and Beatrice enter the room and walk toward the piano . &nbsp; BRADFORDI hope I 'm not too early , Mrs. Minnett . I brought Miss  --  He stops abruptly as Laura comes out from behind the vase . &nbsp; BRADFORDOh , I 'm sorry . ( to Beatrice ) Darling , this is not Mrs. Minnett. ( to Laura ) I 'm Oliver Bradford . I stopped by last week and persuaded Mrs. Minnett to rent her cottage to us . &nbsp; PENNINGTONI know . I 'm Laura Pennington . I  --  Mrs. Minnet , her dusting cap gone , her hair tidied , emerges from the hallway . Oliver sees her .  --  15  --  &nbsp; BRADFORDHello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BRADFORD ( introducing Beatrice ) This is Miss Alexander . Mrs. Minnett . &nbsp; BEATRICEHow do you do , Mrs. Minnett . &nbsp; BRADFORDAnd this  --  &nbsp; BEATRICEThe maid ! Oh , yes . Laura gathers up the cut stems , which are on a paper , and picking up the scissors too , goes with them into the hallway , turning toward the kitchen . Beatrice , meanwhile , has been looking around the hallway and into the living room . She turns to Mrs. Minnett . &nbsp; BEATRICEIs there a dining room ? &nbsp; MRS . MINNETTNo . Oliver indicates the big fireplace in the living room , the fire glowing brightly on the hearth . &nbsp; BRADFORDI thought we could dine by the fire , dear . &nbsp; BEATRICEOh . &nbsp; MRS . MINNETTWould you like to see the upstairs ? &nbsp; BEATRICEThank you . She starts toward the stairs with Mrs. Minnett , then pauses to look at Oliver who is gazing about the living room . &nbsp; BRADFORDI 'll stay here , dear . I 've already seen it .  --  16  --  &nbsp; BEATRICE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts up the stairs with Mrs. Minnett . &nbsp; BEATRICE ( to Mrs. Minnett ) My mother warned me that men are n't interested in the practical side of house-keeping . &nbsp; BRADFORDIt 's a law . He steps down into the living room , removing his topcoat , then places his coat over the arm of a chair , lights a cigarette and looks around the room interestedly . A framed needlework pattern on the chimney breast of the fireplace attracts his attention , and he goes over to it . The design of the pattern consists of a family crest surrounded by a chain of fifteen links , each link enclosing the name of one of the first fifteen states of the union . Oliver examines the pattern curiously . 18 TWO SHOT of Oliver and Laura . Laura re-enters the room with a small vase of flowers , which she quietly puts on the table . &nbsp; BRADFORDWhat an odd pattern ! ( to Laura ) Did this belong to the old boy who first built the place ? &nbsp; PENNINGTONIt was his family crest . The chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American states . &nbsp; BRADFORDWhat a charming idea  --  for an Englishman . Oliver sees a beautiful old goblet on the mantel and he picks it up admiringly . It is a very large goblet , holding a good fifth of liquor . &nbsp; BRADFORDThis is really an old goblet , is n't it ? Ca n't even read the inscription . Was this the old boy 's too ?  --  17  --  &nbsp; PENNINGTONNo . That was given to the favorite son and his wife . They drank a toast from it on their wedding night . Oliver stares incredulously at the enormous goblet . &nbsp; BRADFORDYou mean just the two of them killed this ? &nbsp; PENNINGTONSo the story goes . &nbsp; BRADFORDWhew . I 'll bet they did n't need a candle to light their way to bed . ( to Laura ) All this was in the old house , hmmm ? &nbsp; PENNINGTONNo . The old house burned down shortly after it was built . That was over a century ago . This wing was all that was saved . The son was the first to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big goblet back on the mantel . &nbsp; BRADFORDWhen you had a cocktail before dinner in those days , it really meant something . Laura smiles and turns away . &nbsp; BRADFORDYou must have been here quite a while  --  with Mrs. Minnett . &nbsp; PENNINGTONOh , no ! I came only this morning . &nbsp; BRADFORDBut you know so much about the cottage . &nbsp; PENNINGTONI was born in the village and lived there for years . When I was a child , I heard all the stories there were about the cottage . It was like  --  like living near a fairy tale . Everyday you could walk by  --  and see where all the stories happened .  --  18  --  &nbsp; BRADFORDNext thing you 'll be telling me it 's haunted . &nbsp; PENNINGTONOh , no ! It 's not haunted ! ( pauses ) It 's enchanted . Oliver had n't expected a serious answer to his mocking question , and looks at her with a bit of surprise . &nbsp; BRADFORDIt comes to the same thing , does n't it ? &nbsp; PENNINGTONNot at all ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's to be restless and uneasy  --  and afraid . It 's ugly . But enchantment  --  that 's to be happy  --  and gay . It 's  --  it 's beauty . ( eagerly ) You see , all the people who lived here loved one another . They all found their heart 's desire . In her enthusiasm , she has walked near the mullioned window . She looks at it and turns excitedly , calling to Oliver . &nbsp; PENNINGTONLook ! Here are their names  --  young men and young women who in this very room pledged to love each other forever . 19 THE CAMERA MOVES IN for a CLOSE TWO SHOT , as Oliver joins Laura at the mullioned window . She points at the panes of glass , which are engraved with many signatures and dates , such as  --  Elizabeth and Michael , 1780 ; Cecelia and Edward , 1784 ; Judith and Richard , 1793 ; Helen and Christopher , 1798 ; Charlotte and William , 1803 ; Fanny and Henry , 1805 ; Jane and Thomas , 1811 ; Katharine and Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and John , 1834 ; Louise and Francis , 1840 ; Evangeline and Clement , 1844 ; Victoria and Philip , 1856 ; Daphne and Nathaniel , 1863 ; Isabel and Charles , 1871 ; Margaret and Eugene 1876 ; Mary Ellen and Malcolm , 1886 ; Penelope and Albert , 1893 ; Phyllis and Harold , 1899 ; Lillian and Roger , 1904 ; Susan and David , 1909 ; Abigail and Tom , 1917.  --  19  --  &nbsp; BRADFORD ( reading two of the signatures at random ) " Evangeline and Clement , 1844 ...

Laura realizes she 's been drawn out more than she would have liked and starts to retire into her spinster shell as Oliver 's attention is diverted by the entrance of Beatrice and Mrs. Minnett . He walks up to Beatrice and puts an arm around her fondly . &nbsp; BRADFORDWell ? &nbsp; BEATRICEDarling , it 's your idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'd say they were prosaic . &nbsp; BRADFORDCome , come now !

Bradford means that he 's applied for a commission in the Army Air Corps . He used to be a flier . &nbsp; MRS . MINNETT ( somewhat startled ) Oh ! &nbsp; BRADFORD ( misinterpreting her alarm ) Do n't worry , Mrs. Minnett  --  the Army 's not my sole means of support . My mother has money , large gobs of it . I 'm really a very good risk , in spite of the  --  uncertainty of my profession . &nbsp; BEATRICE ( who does n't like such jokes ) Really !  --  21  --  &nbsp; BRADFORD ( reaching into his pocket ) At any rate , I have a check for the first two months ' rent . &nbsp; MRS . MINNETTNo thank you . Later will do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you 're going to have us on your hands for quite a spell , you know . At least , until I get my commission . And I really do n't expect that for three months . Mrs. Minnett is staring at him strangely , her eyes darker ana more far-seeing than usual . &nbsp; MRS . MINNETT ( with odd quietness ) It may be sooner than you think . &nbsp; BRADFORD ( amused ) My commission ? Not a chance . Army red tape , and all that . They tell me down in Washington  --  Beatrice is looking impatiently at her watch . She interrupts . &nbsp; BEATRICEOliver ! &nbsp; BRADFORDOh , all right , darling . We 'll show up on Tuesday , Mrs. Minnett , and I hope  --  He sees Laura standing apart near the mullioned window . He smiles at her . An idea strikes him , and he turns to Beatrice . &nbsp; BRADFORDDear , let me have your ring , will you ? &nbsp; BEATRICEMy ring ? &nbsp; BRADFORDYour engagement ring . Now that we 're going to settle down here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up all the old traditions .  --  22  --  &nbsp; BEATRICEWhat are you talking about ? &nbsp; BRADFORDJust give me the diamond . You 'll see . Laura , sensing what he wants to do , goes over to the desk . Beatrice takes the ring from her finger and gives it to Oliver . He goes over to the window and starts to scratch his and Beatrice 's names on the pane , but at the first stroke , the diamond falls out and rolls to the floor . &nbsp; BEATRICEOh , Oliver ! &nbsp; BRADFORDI 'm sorry . &nbsp; BEATRICEWhat are you trying to do anyway ? &nbsp; BRADFORDI 'll explain later . Laura has found the loose diamond , and gives it to Oliver . &nbsp; BRADFORDThank you .

Laura frowns , and thinking that Mrs. Minnett has returned to the room , calls out to her over her shoulder as she picks up the calendar . &nbsp; PENNINGTONYour calendar 's way off , Mrs. Minnett . You 're  --  let me see , today is  --  December 7 , ' 41 and April 6 , 1917  --  why , you 're just twenty-four years , ten months , and one day off schedule ! She turns around with the calendar in hand , but then stops short , seeing that she is alone in the room . Wonderingly , she puts down the calendar and crosses to the hallway , where she stops , staring before her . Notes 11 EXT .

Oliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army Air Force , is packing his things ; Beatrice is helping him . ( They are packing only the few regulation articles of officers ' wear that Oliver can take with him . ) Trying to help in the packing is Violet Price , Oliver 's mother . She is a pretty , very feminine woman , soft and excitable and not of much assistance in the packing . Everything Mrs. Price takes out of the bureau drawers and puts on the bed to be packed , Beatrice or Oliver must return patiently and surreptitiously to the place from which she had originally taken it . Her husband , Oliver 's stepfather , is Frederick Price , a tall , robust , well-tailored man , wholly material , completely insensitive . His hair is graying fashionably . There is a feeling of great urgency in the characters ' actions ; they are playing against time . &nbsp; FREDEICK ( looking at his wristwatch ) You 've got exactly thirty-five minutes , Ollie . &nbsp; BRADFORDThanks , Freddie .

You give no quarter , you get no quarter . I can remember back in ' 17 --  &nbsp; VIOLETYou 'd think people would have learned better in twenty-five years . It 's simply ridiculous , Oliver .

Oh , dearl . Her eyes light on a sports sweater which she had laid out for Oliver and which he has returned to the bureau drawer . She holds it up and looks at him reproachfully . &nbsp; VIOLETDo n't you want to take along this nice warm sweater I knitted for you , Oliver ?  --  26  --  &nbsp; BRADFORDIt 's not regulation , mother . Mrs. Price reluctantly puts the sweater back . &nbsp; VIOLETWell , if they 're going to decide what 's regulation and what is n't ! &nbsp; BRADFORDThey are assuming quite a responsibility , are n't they ?

Mr. Bradford has received his commission and already reported for special duty .

Towards the close of her talk with Mrs. Minnett , the sound of airplanes has begun to be heard o.s . It becomes louder . Mrs. Minnett pays no attention but Laura looks up , to see a formation of bombers high up in the sky above her . &nbsp; PENNINGTONI wonder what ever happened to them . &nbsp; MRS .

She is clearing the dishes , stacking them neatly in a tray which is to be lowered in the disinfectant solution that is in one of the sinks . The kitchen is neat and clean . Over the sink on a shelf is a large box upon which the words " CANTEEN SUPPLIES " are printed in large letters . The head of the senior hostesses enters . She is a vain , middle-aged woman , who is , without much luck , trying to ignore her years . She is thoroughly superficial and is acting a part .

Suddenly o.s. , over the sound of the rain , is the noise of an automobile coming to a stop . Oliver pauses and goes over to the window . 47 SHOOTING OVER Oliver 's shoulder , we look DOWN to see that a large expensive car has stopped at the front gate . Frederick Price is opening an umbrella , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they get out of the car , and run through the rain up the path toward the cottage door .

O.s. is the soun of the front door knocker downstairs . Oliver makes up his mind . Quickly he closes his bedroom door and turns the key in the lock .

When he was a little boy , I can remember  --  There 's simply no reason for him to run away from home .

As she does so , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems weary and depressed . &nbsp; FREDERICKNo luck , I 'll bet . Mrs. Price shakes her head despondently and sinks with a sigh onto the sofa .

There 's some fresh hot water here . &nbsp; VIOLETThank heavens , tea ! I 'd love a cup , dear . Beatrice sets about preparing a fresh cup of tea for Mrs. Price , who sinks back upon the sofa , daubing at her eyes with her handkerchief . There are tears in her voice . &nbsp; VIOLETHe wo n't even unlock the door . He told me to go away . &nbsp; FREDERICKWe might just as well go home . We 've done our best .

I  --  I even cried a little . But I 'm afraid he 's just like his father . Beyond all persuasion . Beatrice looks at her for a moment , then returns to her chair and sits down . &nbsp; FREDERICKLook here , Vi , I 've got an idea . What say we leave him up here for a bit ? &nbsp; VIOLETIt does n't seem to me we 've got much choice . &nbsp; FREDERICKA few weeks of living here with himself , and I 'll wager you he 'll appreciate a little friendly society . &nbsp; VIOLET ( ignoring Frederick ) Whatever happened between you two , Beatrice ? &nbsp; BEATRICEBetween us ? &nbsp; VIOLETSomething did happen between you and Oliver , did n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the girl . &nbsp; VIOLETDid you quarrel ? Is that really why he ran away and came here ? &nbsp; BEATRICE ( shortly ) No . We did n't quarrel . &nbsp; VIOLETWell , then there 's just one thing to do . You 've got to go upstairs and talk to him  --  because if there 's anyone who can persuade him to leave this dreadful place and come home , it 's you .  --  47  --  &nbsp; BEATRICEI could n't ! &nbsp; VIOLETYou 're our only hope . &nbsp; FREDERICKListen , Vi , I told you , if I could n't persuade him  --  why , it stands to reason  --  &nbsp; BEATRICEHe wo n't talk to me . &nbsp; VIOLETBut you do n't know , dear , for certain that he wo n't  --  until you try . &nbsp; BEATRICEI wish you would n't ask me , Mrs. Price . &nbsp; VIOLETIf you fail , we 'll give up and go home .

She waits , then knocks again .  --  48  --  &nbsp; BEATRICEWo n't you talk to me ? Wo n't you ? Please ? There is still no answer . As she proceeds with her ploa , she begins to lose confidence , and her voice gains a more desperate tone . &nbsp; BEATRICEI meant what I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be married right away . I 'll look after you  --  and I 'll try to make you a good wife . ( pauses ) Oh , why did we have to have this terrible war ? You see , Oliver , that first day when you came home , no one had told me . And when you turned and looked at me , I was n't prepared . That 's why you thought I --  ( pause ) Wo n't you speak to me , Oliver ? I ca n't help it if I 'm weak . I tried to be bravo about it . Really I did . I did try . I did !

Weeping , despite herself , she starts downstairs . DISSOLVE pp . NA-23 &nbsp; pp. 49-68 51 INT . OLIVER 'S COTTAGE BEDROOM - TWILIGHT Oliver , in silhouette , is huddled in a chair , his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , o.s. , comes the sound of the Prices ' car as the motor starts , and the automobile is driven away . Oliver raises his head and listens for a second . The sound of the motor car dies away . Oliver rises and crosses the room to the door . He unlocks the door and opens it . Outside in the hallway is only silence ; there is no one about . He half shuts the door , but it does not completely catch . Wearily brushing his hand across his brow , he turns from the door and starts back across the room . Almost simultaneously there is a loud clap of thunder and a flash of lightning . As if there might be a witness , he covers his head with his hands as he crosses the room to the window . Restlessly , he stands at the window for a moment , and then turns away from it in torment . For a moment he falls into a chair , then rises and stumbles across the room to the chest of drawers , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He fumbles in his pocket for a book of matches , finds it , strikes a match , and holds it in front of his face , peering at himself in the mirror . The CAMERA MOVES UP for a CLOSEUP of the reflection in the mirror , SHOOTING OVER Oliver 's shoulder as he sees himself . This is the first time we see Oliver 's face since the plane accident . His features have changed shockingly . His face is haggard , the muscles pulled down on one side giving him a hangdog look . Deep shadows-are under the eyes , and his dark eyes are haunted with moments of suffering . The nerves on one side of his face are apparently frozen , for he can betray no emotion with the features of that side . All of his emotions are thus rendered curiously twisted . A smile , a frown , a sneer  --  they are all made sardonic by the unplastic mask that is one side of his face . The light flares up brightly on the match then dies away , leaving him again in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightning , giving us another view of this horrible side of his face . After a moment , as if transfixed , during the flash of lightning , Oliver pounds his fist on the dresser top . Then , half mad with anger and driven to desperation by the cruel turn his destiny has taken , he comes to a quick decision . He draws back , opens one of the top drawers , searching among the neat piles of clothing for something . CLOSEUP of Oliver 's hands as they discover a revolver . BACK TO SCENE . Oliver takes the revolver slowly from the drawer . 52 INT . COTTAGE UPPER HALLWAY - TWILIGHT SHOT of Laura as she comes up the stairs and goes toward Oliver 's bedroom . She has a lighted kerosene lamp in her hand which she is bringing to him . She pauses a moment , and then knocks on the door , which is still slightly ajar . At the same instant she knocks , there is a loud crash of thunder . She hesitates a moment , and then thinking Oliver may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his voice , she pushes the door open . As the door swings gently open , Oliver is revealed with his back to her . He has raised the revolver in his hand and has just snapped off the safety catch . 53 INT . OLIVER 'S COTTAGE BEDROOM - TWILIGHT Laura has paused , with a sharp gasp upon her lips . Oliver , hearing her and observing the light that has come into the room , turns toward her . As he sees her , he lets his hand fall in almost exaggeratedly slow motion , and the revolver drops out of it . Exhausted , he falls down into a chair near the table where the lamp has been put . Laura walks toward him , looks at the revolver , then picks it up . Oliver turns away .  --  50  --  &nbsp; PENNINGTONI 'll  --  take this ( pausing ) If you do n't mind ? &nbsp; BRADFORDIf you want .

OLIVER 'S COTTAGE BEDROOM - NIGHT Oliver is sitting alone at the table near the lighted lamp , musing unhappily . Outside , the rain is still coming down . A knock sounds at the door , and Oliver raises his head . &nbsp; BRADFORDYes ?

He opens the envelope and reads the brief letter , while Laura goes about setting a small table in front of the open fire . Oliver reacts to the letter 's contents with a frown , rises impatiently , crumples the letter , throws it into the fire and stands for a second watching the paper burn . &nbsp; PENNINGTONI 'm afraid she was very upset when she left this afternoon . &nbsp; BRADFORDMy dear Miss  --  I 'd be most grateful if you 'd mind your own business . Laura turns away . &nbsp; BRADFORDLook hero , I 'm sorry . That was extremely rude of me. ( crossing to her ) But do n't you understand ? Do you think I want people to see me  --  the way I am ?

You ca n't realize what it is to face life like this  --  ugly and  --  Oliver breaks off as he looks at her and suddenly realizes that the girl he is talking to is herself ugly , and that she has been ugly and aware of it all her life . She continues to look squarely at him . His is the first gaze to break . He averts his eye , not so much from her as from the realization that he has made a cheap fool of himself .  --  52  --  &nbsp; PENNINGTONYour supper , Mr. Bradford . As he turns to look at her , she moves his chair up to the table , which is ready for him . Slowly , he comes over and sits down . He seems incapable of further action .

COTTAGE LIVING ROOM - DAY Through the glass French doors leading out into the garden it is evident that It is a bright sunny day . The doors are closed , and It is quiet and still in the room . Oliver comes into a part of the scene , and pushes the doors open . Immediately the world becomes alive with the sounds of spring . a robin is singing , and there are other birds calling from the tall trees . 57 EXT . COTTAGE GARDEN - DAY Oliver steps out into the garden . He looks ill and depressed . His unlit pipe in his mouth , he saunters along meaninglessly . The trees and shrubs are budding with fresh leaves , the sun is warm and bright , there is a clean smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound of birdsong , there is the rush of the small waves of the sea breaking upon the shore .

She looks up at Oliver and smiles , half in embarrassment , at him . 59 LAURA AND OLIVER &nbsp; PENNINGTONGood morning . Oliver nods an abrupt greeting to her . He is in an extremely bad mood , but ca n't help looking down wonderingly at the design she has been cutting . &nbsp; BRADFORDWhat 's that you 're doing ? &nbsp; PENNINGTONA block print . &nbsp; BRADFORDLooks as if you were pretty good . He turns away and resumes his troubled pacing . His back is to Laura , who takes a quick look at him . &nbsp; PENNINGTONI work on them every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of block prints once in Boston . Some of Holbein 's they were . That 's what started me . It was obvious they took both infinite patience and time , and ... well , I had a lot of both . Although it 's equally obvious I 'll never got as good as Mr. Holbein . &nbsp; BRADFORD ( stops and turns to her ) Ever done anything with your prints ? Shown them to anybody , I mean ? He resumes his pacing without waiting for an answer . &nbsp; PENNINGTONWell , I entered some in an exhibit once . Some seascapes . And I won a prize too . It was n't first prize  --  but it was a prize .  --  54  --  Oliver turns to her again . &nbsp; BRADFORDI used to win prizes too . Tennis  --  polo  --  and  --  He picks up one of the tools and looks at it . As he continues the talk , he sits down . He is becoming more relaxed , which is what Laura has been after . &nbsp; BRADFORDI must say , it 's kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knew a fellow used to make ship models in glass bottles . Always asked him to tell me why . Never got a satisfactory answer . &nbsp; PENNINGTONWell , I do block prints  --  ( she thinks for a moment ) because I like to do block prints . &nbsp; BRADFORDThat makes sense . He used to tell me . with him it was because  --  it had a resemblance to life , if you looked at it largely . All of us  --  one way or another  --  we were full master schooners or whaling ships or brigantines or even canoes  --  ready to sail into life  --  only there we were , locked up in glass bottles . ( smiles ) Just like to make them . I never thought of that . I bet he never did either . &nbsp; PENNINGTONIt 's a matter of finding something you like . &nbsp; BRADFORD ( with an ironic smile ) Sure , sure . What if I were to take up something like this wood blocking business ? Ca n't you just hear the people I used to know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've heard about it , have n't you ? Oliver Bradford 's won a prize for a wood block ! Of course , he 's had to give up tennis , and he 's sold his horses but he 's really doing the cleverest things  --  " He leaves the sentence incomplete . Embarrassed , Laura looks down at the simple tools in his hands . &nbsp; BRADFORDI 'm sorry . I was n't trying to belittle your work . &nbsp; PENNINGTONI know you were n't . You 'll find a hobby of your own one of these days  --  I hope . &nbsp; BRADFORD ( smiling ) Be careful ! You do n't want to talk like Freddie , do you ? &nbsp; PENNINGTONFrom the way you say it , I 'm sure I do n't  --  and I do n't even know who Freddie is . &nbsp; BRADFORDThat 's the best tiling that can happen to anybody . Not to know who Freddie is.

You 'd be amazed how few people have any .  --  56  --  Laura looks at him , realizing that she is not supposed to answer him . They look at each other for a moment . Then he turns away abruptly and moves off among the ruins . She looks after him with sympathetic concern , then , sighing , she begins to gather together her block cutting equipment .

Hillgreve nods to the boy good-naturedly , and Johnny runs out into the hall .

Fairly often , they seem silly to other people .  --  60  --  &nbsp; PENNINGTONI know what you mean . Particularly about this cottage . &nbsp; HILLGROVE ( eagerly ) Do you ? Because somehow I  --  well , my main feeling is that if I were to get to know it  --  to know what it 's about  --  it would be more than just a cottage to me . It has a life of its own , to me , and everything connected with it  --  Mrs. Minnett , for instance . I wonder about her . &nbsp; PENNINGTONWhen she first came here , she came as a bride . She was to have lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last war . Time seems to have stopped for her  --  the day her husband went away . &nbsp; HILLGROVE ( nodding ) She has withdrawn into the past . I see .

Laura moves forward and takes his arm . &nbsp; PENNINGTONLet me take you to Mr. Bradford , Mr. Hillgrove . I 've only just left him in the garden . Hillgrove nods , as she guides him toward the garden , first picking up his hat and stick . Section Details 64 EXT . COTTAGE GARDEN - DAY Oliver knocks the ashes from his pipe , striking the bowl of the pipe against one of the ruined fragments of the old manor house . O.s. is the sound of Laura 's voice .

Laura leaves them . Hillgrove pauses for a moment , waiting for Oliver to start talking , but Oliver is not too happy to be in the presence of a stranger . Hillgrove tries to break the ice . &nbsp; HILLGROVEForgive me for intruding on you this way , but my brother-in-law , Dr. Stanton , suggested that since we were neighbors , we might also be friends . &nbsp; BRADFORD ( shortly ) I ' m not-much good at friendship or anything else these days . There is a brief pause . Oliver has half turned away Hillgrove leans forward quietly . &nbsp; HILLGROVESick man , are n't you ? &nbsp; BRADFORD ( bitterly ) Do n't I look like one ? &nbsp; HILLGROVE ( simply ) I would n't know .

( meditating the question ) By cultivating other senses , ray boy . It 's a fascinating game . It opens new worlds to you .  --  63  --  &nbsp; BRADFORDHow ? &nbsp; HILLGROVE ( searching for the right words ) Well , in place of these two eyes that are gone , I have a hundred invisible ones that see things as they really are . The other senses come to your aid . Touch , smell , sound . There comes a heightening of perceptions , a  --  a sort of sensitivity to all living things . For instance , nature is more beautiful than I know it and human beings more understandable . Sometimes , I feel it was before the Argonne that I was blind , and that it 's only now that I see ! &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of words . Oh , maybe you 've kidded yourself into thinking it 's true  --  maybe for you it is true . But it would never work for me . &nbsp; HILLGROVEWhy not ? &nbsp; BRADFORDBecause I still want the same things I wanted when I was strong and healthy . In the hospital , I used to sit at my window , where I could see some kids playing tennis . I 'd watch them for a while  --  until I just could n't stand it ! &nbsp; HILLGROVE ( quietly ) I used to play myself . Matter of fact , one year at Forest Hills I won the mixed doubles with Mrs. Wilson Jones . &nbsp; BRADFORDHillgrove  --  John Hillgrove  --  why of course ,  --  I 've read about you . You used to have a terrific forehand drive . &nbsp; HILLGROVEThat 's right . Oliver is silent .  --  64  --  &nbsp; HILLGROVEI batted my head against many a wall , just the way you 're doing .

You 're a complete individual . Remember that . Your trouble is that you 're like a man who 's reached a place where the road branches off into many little side paths . You do n't want to go ahead  --  you want to go back . You 're confused . At the hospital , they told you , " Go ahead . But do n't go that way . Nor that way . Go this way !

He has clearly recognized the handwriting . Unhappily , he opens the envelope , takes out the letter and starts to read it . It 's several pages in length , but the first page clearly contains a message of doom . He does n't finish the letter . He is stunned . It 's as if he had been hit over the head with a blunt instrument . He holds the letter loosely in his hands ; it might easily fall from them . He is literally staring into space . Then , almost like a sleepwalker , the last few pages unread , his eyes wide open , he starts out of the room . Laura enters . &nbsp; PENNINGTONMr .

If necessary  --  if I do n't care to come home  --  they 're determined to close the house at Bar Harbor and spend the summer with me , to start with .

He pauses , conscious of her reaction . &nbsp; BRADFORDI had no idea I was going to ask you , but I 'm glad I did . Will you believe me that the very asking makes me realize I 've been thinking about it for some time  --  and that I mean it with all my heart ? &nbsp; PENNINGTONIf you want to marry  --  to get rid of your family  --  there must be dozens of girls who 'd suit your purpose better than I would . &nbsp; BRADFORDDo you think I have such a great choice ? A hideous casualty for the rest of my life ! &nbsp; PENNINGTONI understand . I get the chance because  --  &nbsp; BRADFORDOh ! I 'm a blundering fool . I Would n't have hurt you for anything in the world . &nbsp; PENNINGTONIt was stupid of me to be upset . It is n't as if I were n't aware of my ugliness.

Day dreams as well as night dreams . Merciful dreams , in which we 're as lovely and desirable as the loveliest and most desirable woman in the world . It 's cruel  --  to destroy those dreams .  --  74  --  &nbsp; BRADFORDI only felt that no woman in the world would marry me except out of compassion  --  I know you have a lot of that  --  ( pauses ) You know how desperate I get at times . But I promise I 'd try not to be too much of a burden . When I felt a black spell coming on , I 'd sneak away and hide in my room until it passed . With you , I would n't have them often , because I like being with you . I like to hear the sound of your voice , your laughter . She turns her head slowly and looks at him .

( long pause ) I 've got to keep on hoping that You 'll say " Yes . " &nbsp; PENNINGTONI do n't want to say " Yes , " just because you want a wife  --  and I happen to be here . Do n't you see ? &nbsp; BRADFORDYes , I see . I see  --  that you Could n't possibly care enough . &nbsp; PENNINGTON ( impulsively ) But I do care .

She clings to him gratefully a brief second , drawing courage from his unspoken love . Then , holding his hand , she turns with him , and they go out of the room toward the stairs . 135 INT .

Hillgrove has come forward , his voice taking on a tone of the greatest urgency . &nbsp; HILLGROVEPlease remember , the next few minutes may be the most important in their lives . You hold their chance for happiness in your hands . &nbsp; FREDERICKThere 's entirely too much mystery about this whole thing to suit me . In my opinion  --  O.s. are the sounds of Laura 's and Oliver 's steps as they come down the stairs . Mrs. Price and Frederick turn toward the entrance way . Frederick frowns curiously . Mrs. Price is twisting her handkerchief with nervous anxiety . The steps grow louder , then cease . There is a mome n't pause of dead quiet . 136 OLIVER AND LAURA APPEAR - BUT AS HIS FAMILY SEE THEM Oliver is again as we saw him , after he was hit , and Laura is the plain little spinster we met at the beginning of the story and in fact , seems even more forlorn now , because her expensive afternoon gown hangs wretchedly on her .

He turns , then presents Laura with the greatest pride . &nbsp; BRADFORDMother , you know my wife , Laura . &nbsp; PENNINGTON ( extending her hand ) I  --  I 'm so glad you 've come to see us , Mrs. Price . Mrs. Price takes Laura 's thin hand and barely prosses it . She can scarcely get out the words of greeting . &nbsp; VIOLETHow  --  how do you do ? &nbsp; BRADFORDYou 've met Freddie , have n't you , Laura . &nbsp; FREDERICKOh , yes , yes !

Because you 're the first  --  you and Freddie . Outside of John here  --  there 's nobody else that knows . &nbsp; FREDERICK ( thinking it over and deciding to start to get things straight ) Look here , Oliver . I really think  --   --  110  --  &nbsp; BRADFORD ( chuckling ) Poor Freddie . It 's a greater shock to you than anyone else , is n't it ? But you 'll soon get used to the change .

You poor , poor darling ! &nbsp; BRADFORD ( comically , he thinks ) Mother , just because you 're happy , there 's really no reason  --  &nbsp; VIOLETForgive me , darling . I did n't mean to go to pieces like this . It 's only that I  --  oh , I love you so much , Ollie , and if you 're really happy  --  well , I guess that 's all that really matters . ( to Laura ) I 'm glad he married you , my dear . Believe me , I am . Because it 's clear you 're such a very loyal girl and have so much to give him  --  oh , so much more than just a  --  a pretty girl . Laura , startled , drops the cup she is holding in her hands , and It shatters on the floor . There is an awkward pause . Then to cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delicate broken pieces . Oliver turns and looks at his mother . Laura puts the pieces of broken china on the tea-table . She looks at Oliver with frantic desperation and sits down at the tea-table . &nbsp; VIOLET ( wanting only to get out ) You must n't bother about tea , Laura , you must n't . I could n't swallow a mouthful . I  --  I 've got an awful headache coming on . You 'll excuse us , wo n't you , if we just run along ?  --  111  --  ( kissing Oliver hastily ) Goodbye , you poor darlings . ( to Frederick ) Come along , Frederick . &nbsp; FREDERICKYes , Vi . Frederick and Mrs. Price go out together . The front door is heard to close . Laura and Oliver , stunned , do n't look at one another but turn slowly and look toward Hillgrove. 138 CLOSE SHOT of Hillgrove . He has one hand raised to his brow .

Mrs. Minnett darts a pitiful glance at Oliver and Laura , then lowers her head again . &nbsp; BRADFORD ( relentlessly ) Have you ? Have you seen any change whatever ? &nbsp; MRS . MINNETTNo . Laura , with a sob , presses her cheek against Oliver 's coat . &nbsp; BRADFORDLook at us ! Mrs. Minnett does not raise her head . &nbsp; BRADFORDLook at us , Mrs. Minnett ! With an effort she turns her eyes toward Oliver and Laura , who hold her glance tensely , drawing themselves up stiffly . &nbsp; BRADFORDThere is no change now ?

Keep your love burning  --  keep it burning  --  and I promise you you 'll never be anything to one another but fair and handsome ! ( pauses , then exultantly ) That 's the charm . That 's the secret to the enchantment this cottage holds . It 's of your own making .  --  114  --  She strikes the backs of her clenched fists to her brow . &nbsp; MRS .

The desk is set apart or is of such a pattern as to indicate a difference between his positio and that of the others . Despite the general illumination of the room , there is a special drop light suspended directly above the sketch , so that his face , when first shown , being outside this light , is not completely realized . Another man  --  Jim  --  is standing alongside the desk , relaxedly , apparently awaiting some comment from Oliver . Oliver looks up and reflects for a moment , before speakin It is now revealed that one side of his face has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scene 51 . ) Jim , however , pays absolutely no attention to this .

Harry , a sketch in his hand , comas into the scene and drops the sketch on the table . &nbsp; BRADFORDHi there , John ! ( pauses ) What 's that ? What 's that ? The rest of the scene is shot from an angle that includes Jim and Harry . Actually , Oliver 's voice comes over scene throughout most of it . Harry is staring intently at Oliver 's scar . Without looking at him , almost as if unaware of what he is doing , Jim raises his farthest foot , swings it in back of him and kicks Harry sharply in the leg . Harry , after a quick reaction and look at Jim , stops looking at Oliver and looks at the sketch . &nbsp; OLIVER 'S VOICEOh , I see . I should have guessed , Laura . He was saying good night , was he ? Well , tell him I said good night to him ..... No , I wo n't be late .....

She moves it about half a foot nearer the piano , then walks back to the sofa and turns off a lamp on a table alongside it . &nbsp; PENNINGTON ( to Annie ) Now ! Annie turns the switch . All the other lights in the room  --  an overhead light and side brackets  --  go out , leaving the light from the standing lamp as the only illumination This gives the room a very warm , pleasant effect and casts most of it , particularly the easy chair and the sofa , into a deep shadow . &nbsp; PENNINGTONThat 's it , Annie . Annie turns the light on again .  --  5  --  &nbsp; HILLGROVE ( a highball in his hand ) This is truly the most comfortable method of superintending my concert arrangements I 've ever experienced .

( nodding ) It is an improvement . As he says this , he gets up and makes his way , a shade uncertainly , as a blind man does , to the little table next to the sofa , on which there are cigarettes and matches . He lights a cigarette and returns to his easy chair . Laura , through this , pays no attention to his minor fumbling and unsteadiness . His blindness is an accepted fact . As he returns from the table : &nbsp; PENNINGTONThat 's debatable , John . After all , I cooked the dinner . There are three quick rings on the doorbell . &nbsp; PENNINGTON ( jumping to her feet ) Oliver ! ! Annie starts for the door , but Laura beats her to it .

For instance  --  well , the very walls of the Enchanted Cottage  --  how can I really show people they 're not walls at all ? That in a certain sense they 're magic and that the air you breathe in the Enchanted Cottage  --  it is n't just air but it 's something that  --  that only certain people can breathe fully .

It is the end of a summer day . &nbsp; HILLGROVE 'S VOICENo place has ever had  --  could ever have had  --  a more enchanting legend . Here it was  --  all that remained of a great estate , built long ago , by an English Nobleman , come to live out his life on these New England shores .

The cottage had obviously once been a wing of the manor house itself , and now , left in this solitary state , it has a curious disproportion . Its fireplace chimney is huge ; its roof , strangely slanting , steeply pitched ; its front window , strikingly large .

It had been remodeled , and the nobleman used to lend it to young married couples to live in as long as they wished .

It is the end of a summer day . &nbsp; HILLGROVE 'S VOICEFrom the first time I became aware of it in the moonlight I sensed its inherent magic . No place has ever had  --  could ever have had  --  a more enchanting legend . Here it was  --  all that remained of a great estate built long ago by an English nobleman , come to live out his life on these New England shores . The house had burned , but its plan was still marked by the crumbling walls , overgrown now with moss and ivy , wild roses and forest violets . Miraculously , one wing had been saved from the flames  --  the . kitchen wing . It had been remodeled , and the nobleman used to lend it to young married couples to live in as long as they wished . But by the time I first came upon it , this gracious tradition was abandoned and almost completely forgotten .

The CAMERA PICKS UP a trail of a rambler rose that has wound up the arch window , AND TRAVELS WITH the rambler over the ruins to the cottage . The cottage had obviously once been a wing of the manor house itself , and now , left in this solitary state , it has a curious disproportion . Its fireplace chimney is huge ; its roof , strangely slanting , steeply pitched ; its front window , strikingly large . As Hillgrove 's narration continues , the CAMERA HAS FOLLOWED the rosevine TO the cottage , and then PULLED BACK until we got a VERY LONG SHOT of the cottage , with the New England shoreline and sea in the f.g .
