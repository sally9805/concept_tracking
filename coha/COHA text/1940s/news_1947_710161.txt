txt A state department plan to send Russia 35 million dollars worth of American industrial equipment without requiring payment a shipping charges stipulated by congress came to light today . E. L. Fisher . assistant general counsel of the lend-lease administration , agreed with Sen. Russell ( D. , Ga. that the deal " would clearly have been a subterfuge to escape the intent of congress . " The material  --  oil field , electrical . and machine tool equipment . among other items  --  was ordered by Russia before President Truman stopped lend-lease on V-3 day , but has not been delivered . Congress required that Russia and other nations receiving goods in such cases should pay 21,4 per cent of their value to . cover shipping costs . Rebate Promised Reds Fisher told the senate appropriations committee , however , that the lend-lease administration , operating under the.state department , had agreed to give . the soviets a subsequent .214 per cent rebate . His testimony at a closed session Friday was made available today by the committee . It produced additional senatorial ' opposition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reporter he thinks the appropriations committee will refuse to approve it . This would stop the state depart . ment 's arrangement , because Controler General Lindsay Warren told the committee he will not approve the transaction unless congress passes legislation making it legal . Administrative Costs Barred A provision inserted by congress in legislation last " year to liquidate lend-lease prohibited the payment of administrative expenses to ship supplies after Dec. 31. 1946 . The state department then arranged for interested governments to pay the cost of the materials they had ordered under lend-lease contracts , plus 21/2 per cent to meet the expense of shipping them . " With Russia , ' Fisher said . " the state department started out by saying it figured the administrative expenses would be about 214 per cent of the goods . " It Russia would contribute 214 per cent of the value for these administrative expenses now , 214 per cent would be knocked off what Russia owed when it negotiated the final settlement . " Russia Only One Favored Russell asked whether similar arrangements were made with other countries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The others were assuming the burden . " " In the case of taking the 214 per cent from Russia and deducting it In the final settlement , " said Russell , " that would clearly have been a subterfuge to escape the intent of congress ? " " Yes , " Fisher replied . Bridges said that in the case of Russia It would mean " taking 21/2 per cent from nothing , because they have not paid anything on lendlease . " " That Is true , " Fisher said . Settlement Bids Ignored The committee previously had reeelved testimony that Russia had ignored all American requests for a settlement of 611,260,000,000 in war lime lend-lease aid . There had been testimony that born o of the equipment was built to Russian specifications , but Russell said much of it is farm equipment , tractors , telephone , and telegraf poles . Warren agreed that the government ought not to have much loss in disposing of such items if they were sold as surplus . Fisher testified the Russians would have 30 years to pay 35 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was " an awfully bad contract . "
