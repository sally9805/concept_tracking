txt WASHINGTON , Feb. 10 ? Clinton P. Anderson , Secretary of Agriculture , hitting back in a dispute over falling farm prices , accused Representative August H. Andresen , Republican , of Minnesota , today of contributing to a " further upset " in the market . Mr. Andresen is chairman of a special House committee which yesterday set out , with denunciations of the Secretary , to investigate the price break of last week . Coincident with the Secretary 's rebuttal , in which he argued that Mr. Andresen had made " completely untrue " and " loose charges " harmful to the farmers , news of fresh and broader declines in the big Exchanger , sharpened the controversy in Congress . The matter of investigations into commodity speculation , in which so far the price to the consumers has been stressed most , appeared about to change somewhat in emphasis and aspect . Mr. Andresen suggested some such move yesterday by stressing an assertion that the Administration , by stopping the buying of wheat , had caused " the bottom to fall out " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than $200,000,000 . " Mr. Andresen 's office first intimated this afteronon that he would retort before the day was out to Secretary Anderson . Later , however , in an indication that the dispute had reached a point of considerable gravity , it was said that the reply would be deferred until tomorrow . A senate committee that has been investigating commodity speculation also appeared to be considering whether it , too , should enter the new situation brought about by the market decline . The group 's senior Republican member , Senator William F. Knowland of California , said in the absence of its chairman , Senator // Homer Ferguson of Michigan , that nothing would be done " this week . " However , it would be well to " keep in touch next week , " he added . Secretary Anderson 's statement , issued in response to accusations made in the *House ' yesterday . by the Minnesotan , said : " Representative Andresen ' S statement about commodity markets is so far away from the actual facts that the inevitable conclusion must be that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ( Government ) manipulated or rigged prices , his statement that some people profit ed by ' advance inside information ' and his report that I ordered Government buying of wheat stopped , last week before the sharp break in th emarket are all completely untrue . " There is no basis whatever for any of these loose charges . Making them at this time can serve only further to upset the market with continued uncertainty to farmers I and harm to many other elements our economy . " End of Controls Recalled Recalling that Representative Andresen had said that " the crash " demonstrated that " the Truman Administratioa has dominated and fixed the price of grains and other commodities since July 1 , 1946 , " the Secretary stated : " He should not mention that date in connection with rising prices . That is the date when price controls were eliminated . The country was promised that production would keep the cost of commodities in line . " Mr. Andresen is quoted as saying that ' while thousands of small speculators and traders . lost their shirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipeline of insider information were able-A o get out of the market without loss or to take a short position and make tremendous profits in a few days . " Again I insist that he name those speculators whom he knows were ! tuned to the . pipeline of inside information . ' I know of no such person . He knows of no such person . Again I charge him with bear hunting with an empty gun . I challenge him to produce one name and show how it was tuned to inside information . I see people who are wired for sound , but I know of no one who was tuned to inside information on this market drop . " Mr. Andresen earlier had demanded that Secretary Anderson name the trader who had been mentioned by the Secretary as having sold a million bushels of wheat " short " on Feb. 4 , the first day of the price break . ' " We want to know , " the Representative asserted , " whether the trader had inside information . On a. transaction like that he must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looks like he knew in advance what was going to happen . " Secretary Anderson took no notice today of Mr. Andresen 's demand . He told reporters yesterday , however , that the transaction was that of a private speculator who had no connection with the Government .
