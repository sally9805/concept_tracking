For six weeks Axis planes have kept up a concentrated bombing effort on Malta that has no parallel in this war . Operating 24 hours a day , Axis high-level and dive-bombers have raided the island over 150 times since Jan. 1 . As many as 17 alarms have occurred in 24 hours . <P> Still undecided about the final explanation for the concentrated attacks , London hinted at invasion last week . But with General Erwin Rommel hanging on in Libya by the skin of his gritty teeth , the bombings probably covered a concerted German effort to get reinforcements to his Afrika Korps and put him back on the offensive . By bombing Malta , the Axis had probably rendered ineffective any R.A.F. bombing operations from the island . As a result , Axis shipping has an even chance of getting to Tripoli and Tunis unbombed , either at base or in transit . <P> However the bombings helped shipping to Africa , it was too late to help one big chunk of Rommel 's Army . Last week , 5,500 Axis troops in the narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the eastern edge of the desert battlefield , gave up . Dusty , thirsty , hungry and 2,200 miles from their main body , they ran up the white flag , surrendered unconditionally to Major General Pierre de Viller 's South African and Free French forces .
