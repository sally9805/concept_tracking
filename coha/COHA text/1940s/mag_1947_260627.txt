No football team ever left West Point with such a send-off and such a premonition of doom . Two M-8 armored cars escorted the squad to the station , where guns boomed out an eleven-gun salute . The brave men of Army were going out to face mighty Notre Dame for the last time . <P> All week long , newsmen pounded out sentimental obits on the end of U.S. football 's Big Game . Why had Army chosen to drop Notre Dame from its schedule ? The consensus : Army , reduced to peacetime status , just did n't have the arms &; the men to conquer Notre Dame . <P> It was no secret , either , that the two coaches-Army 's Red Blaik and Notre Dame 's Frank Leahy-were n't exactly cronies . When asked about it , Leahy said : " I have no animosity toward Blaik ... I do n't know the man . . . . " A couple of cold , windy days later they posed for a wintry-faced picture ( see cut ) . <P> Notre Dame-Army had n't always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had gone to neither school , and paid up to $100 a seat to act as if they were charter alumni . When it first visited West Point in 1913 , Notre Dame was an unsung little Indiana college . In those days spectators got in free , Notre Dame got $1,000 guarantee for the trip and cleared $83 profit . In this game the late , great Knute Rockne ( an end ) and Gus Dorais ( a quarterback ) put on a great passing show . Until three years ago , Notre Dame had a top-heavy edge of 22 victories to five losses . Then , while Leahy was off to war , Army 's super-dupers , led by the great Davis &; Blanchard , humbled the proud Irish two years in a row , 59-0 , 48-0 . But , until last week , a Blaik-coached Army eleven had never scored on a Leahy-coached Notre Dame team . <P> The experts ignored Leahy 's coachly gloom ( " We are not equipped . ' We do not have the weapons " ) , made the Irish an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's trigger-armed Quarterback Johnny Lujack . But no sooner had the game begun in jampacked Notre Dame stadium than Leahy uncovered another weapon : a Fighting Irish player who was actually Irish . It took Halfback Terry Brennan exactly 21 seconds to take the opening kick-off and scamper 97 yards for a touchdown . That took the spark out of Army , although they fought hard and had carefully memorized Coach Blaik 's elaborate plans for stopping Johnny Lujack 's passes . To make things tougher , Notre Dame uncorked a ground attack it was n't supposed to have . Final score : Notre Dame 27 , Army 7.
