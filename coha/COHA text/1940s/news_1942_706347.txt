txt Lashing out against Mayor La Guardia 's reduction of $868,358 in the Park Department budget for 1942-43 , Park Commissioner Robert Moses said yesterday that the recreational facilities of his department might better be closed than operated under conditions which made increased vandalism possible and diminished public safety in the parks . Declaring that the park system could not be operated properly on his allowance of $9,920,192 for next year , Mr. Moses said the Mayor 's reduction was " an arbitrary cut that does n't represent any study in the needs of the Park Department or how the department can function . " His budget for the current year is $10,788,551 , and he had asked a 1942-43 budget of $11,940 , - 593 . By cutting the department 's budget to $9,920,192 , therefore , the Mayor took more than $2,000,000 from Mr. Moses ' request for the budget year beginning on July 1 . " Prices are rising for necessary material and equipment , " Mr. Moses said , " and the general effect will be that there will not be enough of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be less vandalism now ? " Mr. Moses asked himself . " No , " he answered himself . " Will the parks be safe ? " he asked . " No , " he replied again . Displays Crime Clippings The Park Commissioner flourished a sheaf of newspaper clippings about his head as he walked rapidly to and fro in his office at 80 Center Street . They told of assaults of violence on persons using the parks , including the fatal stabbing of a 15-year-old boy , the conviction of two Negro youths for rape and the strangling of another person by " muggers " who were furious because he had only 14 cents in his pocket . " That 's a cheerful thing to have happen in our parks , " he commented . " If a person would only realize the size of the beats a cop must patrol in the parks , you would then realize what chance you would have in case of trouble . You 'd be at Eighth Avenue and the patrolman would be at Fifth Avenue  --  if he happened to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This department has operated on the theory that the people wanted additional recreational facilities and that the Mayor advocated and supported extension of the park system . If the public does n't want to maintain them cleanly , decently and safely , we had better not have them . That 's all there is to my philosophy of it . The system can not be maintained properly on the basis of this budget . " Criticizes Mayor 's Bookkeeping Mr. Moses was annoyed over the Mayor 's inclusion of a credit of $854,930 which was applied to the Park Department by the Mayor . The sum ostensibly includes Park Department revenues from its selfsupporting projects , which by law must go into the general fund of the city for the reduction of taxation each year . " That 's the funniest bookkeeping I ever saw , " he remarked . " Under the law this money should go into the general fund instead 9f being earmarked for Park Department purposes . It 's impossible to figure it out at this stage of the game . " Asked if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' 7 do n't care how they do it , so long as it is real money and not Mexican . " The Park Commissioner criticised the Mayor indirectly for cutting the 2 per cent city sales tax to 1 per cent in his last campaign for re-election . " If the 1 cent sales tax had n't been cut off before election , we would have had enough money , " he said . Mr. Moses said the usefulness of the department 's thirteen indoor pools would be zut in half by the // MOSES DENOUNCES CUT IN PARK FUNDS // Mayor 's plan to operate them on one shift a day instead of two shifts . Some facilities will be closed , he said , while others will be so poorly manned and protected that the result will be bad for the city . Cuts Disturb Other Officials While the Park Commissioner was outspoken in his criticism , other department heads were worrying over how they would continue under the 10 per cent cut which the Mayor carried through almost the entire budget . Acting Borough President Cornelius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get along under its total of $1,187,757 , a cut of $116 , - 065 . Borough President John Cashmore of Brooklyn said his new budget would require extensive study to determine just how it affects his staff . Ordway Tead , chairman of the Board of Higher Education , said he was fairly well satisfied with the $9,532,352 allowed for his agency , though it involved a cut of $333,101 from its budget request . Mr. Tead said the cut probably would mean small staff reductions in the four city colleges , but added that the city institutions would be able to carry out their work effectively . Francis S. Moseley , president of the Teachers Alliance , which claims 8,000 members , criticized the Mayor 's cut of $3,000,000 in the education appropriation . Instead of being cut , he said , the wartime education budget should have been increased . He attacked the Mayor for using budget reduction as a spur on the Legislature to pass a retirement bill requiring education employes to retire at 65 , and said the actual classroom ratio was higher than the Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C.
