Little Father Lenin was having a tough time of it . In 1942 , the Finsbury Borough Council had erected a statue to Russia 's First Proletarian in front of the Holford Square house in which he had once lived . Since then , the dead-white bust on its red marble base has had nary a moment 's peace . Time &; again it has been defaced-once with black paint of such tenacity that the slyly benign features remained permanently piebald . <P> Then , on a gloomy midnight last December , especially irreverent and irresponsible vandals went to work on the bust with a hammer . Result : no nose , a gouged-out chin , a scar on the left cheek , a chewed-off ear . This , the London constabulary decided , was too much of a good thing . The memorial was covered with a huge black tarpaulin and three bobbies detailed to perpetual guard duty . <P> Last week , Tory M.P . William Shepherd rose in Commons . Asked he : " Is it not a waste of three policemen 's time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he left without paying his rent. * Can not the Home Secretary get this bust put in an institution ? " <P> Replied Home Secretary James Chuter Ede , with simple dignity : " No , sir , there are many statues in London which give rise to acute controversy . . . . We have to live and let live in these matters . " <P> Said Tory M.P . Sidney Shephard : " Is it not a fact that this statue is covered by a tarpaulin and can not be seen by the public ? " <P> Said Ede : " It is a great pity that some of the other monstrosities in London are not similarly treated . " <P> <P> * Not so ; a libel , declared Finsbury 's Town Clerk .
