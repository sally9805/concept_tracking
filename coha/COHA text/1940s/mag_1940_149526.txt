Fifty years ago few divorced persons were so brazen as to appear in any church . But like the horseless carriage , divorce has since become such a commonplace ( 16 out of every 100 U. S. marriages ) that U. S. churches have changed their tune . Few officially allow their ministers to remarry divorced persons ( save innocent parties in divorces for adultery ) or admit them to Communion after remarriage . Unofficially , many U. S. churches allow both . Last week the relatively small ( 1,900,000 members ) but influential Protestant Episcopal Church , which in law and practice has been among the strictest , made ready to reconsider its stand . The church 's Commission on Marriage and Divorce unanimously proposed a canon which , if adopted at the Episcopalians ' General Convention in Kansas City next month , will permit a person divorced on any grounds whatsoever to remarry and then obtain the church 's blessing . <P> The commission 's new version of the marriage canon still forbids Episcopalian marriage for divorced persons , still provides that anyone remarried by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Communicant . " The new feature is a provision that " he or she may apply to any Minister of the Church . . . for the restoration of such status and for a blessing upon their union . The Minister . . . shall then lay the petition and his findings be fore the Bishop . . . . In case of a favorable judgment , the Minister in his discretion may bless the parties to the union , using such parts of the Office for the Solemnization of Matrimony as are pertinent thereto . " <P> Chairman of the Commission on Marriage and Divorce since it was set up in 1925 has been grey , liberal Right Rev. Herman Page , 74 , retired Bishop of Michigan , who feels that " the church must start with biology and the sanctification of sex . " To implement this realistic view , the new canon would require every clergyman to make sure that the Christian ideal of marriage as " a life-long union of husband and wife " is understood and sought by the persons to be married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort " to realize that ideal . Every clergyman is further required to " use all diligence in preserving the peace and concord of every family within his cure , " and " whenever the security or permanence of any home is imperiled . . . it shall be the duty of the parties to such dissension to lay before him the causes and circumstances thereof , and it shall be his duty to labor by all godly means to restore them to charity with each other . " <P> Commission-chosen to expound the new canon was Professor Howard Chandler Robbins of Manhattan 's General Theological Seminary . His statement that " forgiveness should be characteristic of the Church , and allowance should be made for the individual 's attitude , " showed what an ecclesiastical revolution widespread divorce has wrought . For paradoxically , Episcopalians , despite their strong stand in the past against divorce , almost certainly have the highest divorce rate of any U. S. sect .
