The painful trench foot of World War I has reappeared in the present comparatively trenchless war . In World War I , soldiers got trench foot from sitting for hours with their feet in mud or cold water . The result was something like severe chilblains , something like a burn : circulation slowed ; feet became numb , swollen and white ; sudden warming sometimes brought blisters and ulcers . The worst cases got gangrene , which meant amputation . Today 's trench foot has different sources : <P> &gt; Doctors call it immersion foot when a seaman 's feet are bloated after long chilling in the sea water shipped by an open lifeboat . <P> &gt;The airman 's form of trench foot was reported last week in the Washington Star : flyers may develop swollen , whitish hands or faces which take months to get well if they whip off masks or gloves for a few moments to make fine adjustments at high altitudes . The accident happens so often that many U.S. doctors in England have made it their chief research . <P> Cold Cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water or minutes in freezing air , the treatment is to handle the injured flesh gently , keep it cold , sprinkle sulfanilamide on all raw spots , and very gradually bring temperature back to normal . In this way , Royal Canadian Navy surgeons made a fine record in treating 150 North Atlantic survivors exposed from 30 hours to 22 days : there were only seven amputations . In England , doctors keep the affected parts in cold water . The Canadians have evolved a refrigerating unit with leg openings like prisoners ' stocks , so that a patient 's body can be kept warm while cold air blows over his feet . Once when a unit broke down and the patient 's feet got warm and painful , doctors found him dangling his feet out the window in the Canadian winter . <P> Misplaced good intentions may result in irreparable damage . The crew of an " internationally known ship " sunk in European waters were rescued by fishermen . The sympathetic rescuers massaged swollen feet briskly ( breaking the weakened , almost-dead skin ) and applied hot-water bottles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to have their feet amputated.
