DING to and fro in the world of planned agriculture and up and clown in it , you conic to a man in Western Kansas planting his wheal in the dust . You say to him : " Do you expect it to grow ? " He says : " No , I 'm not expeetieg it to grow . That 's why I 'm planting it . " And with that he goes on . Then you meet the count-a , agent , who administers this world , and ask him : " Why does a man say he plants his seed in the dust because he does n't expect it to grow ? " " He does it to qualify , " says the county agent . " You mean to qualify for a policy with the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation ? " " That 's it , " says the county agent . " He 's expecting a drought . " " Like betting the Government he wo n't make a crop . If a drought comes , he wins the bet and the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it around here , " the county agent answers . " And what 's more , if the Government has to pay the farmer on his insurance policy , it will he whirling too . ' ' " How can both of them win ? " " The price of wheat will go up . " " What does the Government win if the price of wheat goes up ? " " Plenty , " says the county agent . " Just plenty . Do n't you know it owns a lot of wheat ? That 's wheat it has been taking of the hands of farmers who had borrowed money on it from the Commodity Credit Corporation . Then you might say the Government would win in another way . If there is a drought and the crop is short , it will he saved the expense of removing a surplus . To get us rid of one hundred and twenty-eight million bushels of wheat from the last crop , the Government had to pay out thirty-three million dollars as export bounties . " The Taxpayer and Wheat AITITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V on . The American taxpayer has a gambling interest in wheat and did n't realize it . lie is gambling on the bull side . A drought will be to his advantage . You begin to play with the idea . Suppose the price of wheat should double . But why think only of its doubling ? Why not corner the wheat , put the price to five dollars a bushel , and begin to balance the budget ? Certainly there is a retch in it , or somebody at Washington would have already thought of it . The catch is that at last someone has to buy the wheat . Everybody who eats bread has to buy it .. The cost of all food would rise . The Government 's relief bill would go up . After all , it seems to ho only the farmer who can win . So there is no help for the budget , but it still remains that if the drought comes and the crop is short , it will not be necessary for the Government to pay people to export wheat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will he saved 5:33,000,000 in export bounties for " removal of surplus , " as it tactfully appears in the budget . To the American taxpayer that is what the dust storm over there on the horizon may be worth , and now , as you look at it , doesa't it seem a little less ominous ? It has a lining . You could n't have imagined that a drought might be a bargain , and with that you stop worrying about it and begin again to notice those white signs that keep appearing on little outbuildings , grain cribs and barn doors . You stop to examine one . It is the seal of the Ever-Normal Granary , signed by the Secretary of Agriculture . Touch it not , under pain of fine and imprisonment . Then the padlock . The farmer comes out to see what you are doing . Ile asks you where you are from . You say you are just from going around . He says too many people are just going around . " So that 's the Ever-Normal-Granary seal , " you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . You explain that you are not trying to find anything the matter with it . Does the grain under such it seal belong to him or to the Government ? He takes time to look you over , and says : " I 'll tell you that when you tell me what the price of wheat will be six months from now . Are you that smart ? " " You mean that if the price goes up the grain is yours , and that if the price goes down it belongs to the Government , for what you have borrowed on it . Meanwhile the Government is paying you seven vents a bushel to store it here . " " That 's it , " he says . " Maybe you are too smart . " You say : " I hear there is a lot of weevil in grain stored like this on the farm . " He says to that : " Do you ? " " How about yours  --  or this ? Have you broken the seal to look at it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . " I ai n't . If that grain was in one of them fine concrete elevators at Kansas City , there 'd he another kind of weevil eating it up . There 's human weevil too . Maybe you 're one of them . A little insect weevil wo n't be so bad if it 's there . It 's helping to put the price up , and that 's more than human weevil ever done . " All of that was autumn . When winter came , the fall-sown wheat that should have been high enough to hide a rabbit , with cattle grazing on it , was in the very best areas a faint green tinge to the slanted vision , and in Western Kansas it was blowing away . Day after day , the sky was dirty with dust storms . The weather map , showing deficits of autumn moisture , was the most alarming anyone had ever seen . Moreover , it was suddenly discovered that the wheat reserve  --  that is to say , the surplus over from the last crop in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an expanding insect world , its food . supply having been increased in a miraculous manner by the storing and sealing of so much grain under Government loan in farm bins , where it could not be properly turned and treated as it would be in commercial elevators . A Prayer for Meld Adversity TT IS only prayer that now can save the wheat crop , 1 and yet the prayer must be a little pulled , for fear it may be overanswered . So they say : " Not the dust bowl again , 0 Lord . Not that . Leave the land where it is . But not too much wheat , either . Not enough to hurt the price . . Just a little drought in a reasonable way of speaking . " The price of wheat was going up . When it was eighty cents a bushel in Kansas City , wheat under seal on a Kansas farm was worth less than the farmer had borrowed on it from the Government , and the Government was welcome to it . When the price was ninety cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both the Government and the farmers were winning . One day in December , wheat crossed a dollar on the Kansas City market , and a member of the wicked grain trade , looking up at the blackboard , said : " Drought and weevil work for the AAA . Moro of that Joseph luck . " He said it bitterly , as a matter of course . The grain trade is sore and melancholy , and has the premonition of becoming a ghost , permitted to survive only as a voice to intone the prices current . For Government now is not only grain merchant unlimited , duplicating the facilities and absorbing the functions Regarding it as a gigantic spec'ulatiuu , the strength of the Government 's operation is that it has the public treasury behind it ; the weakness of it is that it must be always on the bull side . as they would say in the grain trade , since its whole purpose 18 to uphold priees . Thus it has the character of a perpetual corner . quite regardless of the state of supply and demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in grain only in definite prospect of scarcity . They wi add know that if they underestimated the silverly or overestimated the demand , or if Nature turned a miracle against them , they were bound to fail , as generally they did , for want of money to go on buying forever . From this nature of the Government 's operation as a perpetual corner , with intent to uphold the price , it follows that if it can not absolutely control production , which has never yet been possible , a time must come when it . will need some Joseph lurk , else the Ever-Normal Granary will burst . Drought is much cheaper and more effective than export . bounties as a way of removing the surplus . Thus you arrive at the contradiction that what this planned world of agriculture needs from time to time is a lucky drought . It may sound cynical when the grain trade says it . Nevertheless , besides being true , it has happened twice before . There was a lucky drought in 1934 and another in 1936 , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Nature in these words : " Actually , unfavorable weather did to production , to an extreme degree , what But in 1937 , next after the drought , crops were enormous , and then arose the Ever-Normal-Granary idea . The Iwo years after that also were fat , lid the fact of three fat years coming in is row like that is what happened to strain the timbers of the granary . Acreage Reduced , Craps Increased So it is that if you were all agricultural correspondent. , writing a piece on the outlook for the current year , you might say something like this : " The prospects for drought are much more favorable as to wheat than for corn . It is true that in the Corn Belt , too , the autumn was the driest ever known , with a rainfall hardly more than one third of normal . Yet a drought that might happily remove the wheat surplus would not necessarily save the corngrowers from the disaster of another large crop ; the difference being that whereas wheat , winter wheat especially , requires autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the rain that falls after May . " The fact is that with corn the Ever-Normal Granary is already bursting . To hold only some of the corn it has been obliged to take off the hands of the farmers , who could n't sell it for enough to pay off their loans , the Gov-eminent has built nearly 40,000 sheet-steel tanks , called corn poppers , each Bolding about 2000 bushels ; and they add a strange new feature to the Corn Belt iaodscape , especially in lawn . it would have been quite as cheap and certainly sorer to stun. the ? orll ill cum mewl al elevators , whore i 1 , milk be better taken care of , hut . the Government felt justified in putting itself to this large extra expense for two reasons . It thought the corn ought to stay near the farms ou which it was grown , for there , if anywhere , the bulk of it will be ultimately consumed ; and , beyond that , it wanted to keep the surplus in the farmer 's eye , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CrOVernment tanks , which contain only the corn the Government has become owner of , farmers , too , have been buying steel tanks and building new cribs out of the seven cents a bushel they receive for storing corn on the farm . Now , there are three kinds of corn in the Cora Belt  --  namely , Government-owned corn . sealed corn and free corn . That is culled free corn which is held out of the Ever-Normal Granary for all uses of corn . In December , with the Government lending fifty-seven cents a bushel on sealed corn , free corn was selling iu Iowa at forty-five cents . What happened in Iowa was a grand pleasantry ' . various cash benefits and indemnities held out to them by the Government , the farmers agreed to cut their corn acreage 10 per cent , because ( here was already a dangerous surplus and the Government was holding the hag . Well , then the farmers selected , of course , the best soil ; they bought more fertilizer , they planted their rows chaser , and they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed had been known for several years , yet the effects hitherto grad been limited by the supply . To produce this seed , the corn plant has to he pollinated by hand , and to get the breeding of it under way on a large scale took time and capital . The cost of it is seven or eight dollars a bushel , but it increases the yield by one third or more . Last year for the first time there was enough of it . The total result was that on fewer acres Iowa produced the finest and almost the largest corn crop in its history  --  more than kilt ' a billion bushels . The average yield was 51Y2 bushels to the acre , yields of 100 bushels were not uncommon , and there were extreme records up to 160 bushels to the acre . This crop , on top of the surplus already there , was prodigious . Another one like it would have the aspect of an economic disaster . The farmers have agreed this year to it further cut in acreage of 12 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while they had an uneasy conscience about what they had done . The Des Moines Register , which is the great Corn-Belt newspaper , proposed the question : Are the Iowa farmers guilty of chiseling if they use hybrid seed and plant corn thicker in the field while at the same time accepting Government checks for cutting down acreage ? " Then it sent out and got opinions on it , and the final opinion was : " He 'd be a fool not to do it . In this day and age , it 's up to every man to employ the most efficient production methods . If he does n't , he 'll be left by the wayside . " Which means , of course , they will do it again this year if they can , and that only Nature can save them . Only such as are by nature unsympathetic to agriculture , or those who have not ion.rnied thernsclvhs car what the rltll.ional agrieul Lurid poliey is , could 111:11i0 an observat ion sic ltene as to say the farmers were ? lii , s0Hig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a private-profit company selling crop insurance on a year-to-year basis , so that a farmer could get his bet down after he saw the dust storm , would lose its shirt . But the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation is not in the business for profit . Its business is to help the farmer . It . is true that when farmers , in return for cash subsidies and other benefits , have agreed to cut down their acreage tinder a production-control program , and then try to grow more than before , they are not co-operating with the Government to limit production . Nevertheless , if by any such means they are able to increase their own income , they are in a positive way assisting the Government to make its agricultural policy effective . The Agricultural Palley For what is that policy ? It is to increase by all possible means the farmer 's income : it is to increase his share of the national income , or , in other words , it is to redistribute the national income in the farmer 's favor . This is definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act . The " objective . " says the AAA , is to ' assist the fanner in obtaining a fair share of the national income . " The law authorizes cash payments out of the public treasury to farmers for the sole purpose of increasing their income . These payments , says the AAA , are to accomplish " iii themselves a partial redistribution of the national income . " The national agricultural policy , says Secretary Wallace , is to get for the farmer " a larger slice of a bigger pie . " How shall the pie be made bigger ? First by giving the farmer a larger slice of what Ili ore is . Then the pie will be in better halanee  --  and " this better balance in turn , " said the AAA , " would serve to stimulate the general economic activity which was necessary if the national income was to be increased . " In trying to bring this policy to pass , the Government has been again and again frustrated , sometimes by the Supreme Court , sometimes by Nature , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaving in a wicked manner . " During all the years of the existence of the AAA , " it says itself , " the farm programs have been under ceaseless attack by powerful and organized forces of opposition . " Never yet has the farmer 's slice of the pie been as big as the Government tells him it ought to be , and this in spite of anything the Government has been able to do about it . Knowing all this , or believing it , the farmer feels morally free to beat the program in any way he can . Although in a particular ease it may appear that he is chiseling the Government , yet nevertheless in a large sense he is co-operating to give the agricultural policy the true effect it was intended to have  --  namely , that of increasing his income . Payments for co-operating in the soil-conservation program ; payments for reducing his acreage ; crop-storage loans ; removing the surplus at . pu I die expense , as by export bounties ; and crop insuran  --  ethese are all ways : Ind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when still it is not enough then it sends him a United States Treasury eheek , not for anything lie has dune or not done , but ' amuse he has not yet received enough . what is to prevent those other groups , identified by Mr. Wallace as labor , corporations and industry , from raising their bargaining power to a point at which again it will be superior to that of the farmer , as evidently they could do , having done it before , and seeing , besides , that the farmer is hound to be the minority group ? Shall the farmer 's bargaining power be raised again by law ? And will not that of the other groups be raised again ? Where should we think we were going ? But suppose that did not happen . Suppose the bargaining power of agriculture were raised to that indefinable point of equality and could be held there against the majority groups . Then you have another problem . Agriculture in that ease would seem to offer a degree of security and a certainty of income such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attraction , how could you keep new people in great number from moving into it and adding themselves to the excess population now trying to sustain itself on the soil ? Every plan for raising the bargaining power of agriculture , to give it economic equality or parity , aims to control the price . Then follow certain things that are true whether you like them or not . You can not control the price unless you control production . All attempts so far to control production of the great staples have been defeated . It is proved that you can not do it by controlling acreage , because the production per acre must in any case be variable in the whim of Nature , and because , secondly , on the man side , it may be increased to an amazing degree by method , as in cotton or corn it was . There is , in fact , no way at all exactly to control agricultural production as you would control the production of pig iron . It is possible to control the supply that comes to market ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , you can control the price . But the only way to control the supply is by compulsory restraint , as when you say to each farmer that only so much shall he sell and no more . Closing the Land That has been tried , and in some cases it has worked , but it can work only for a while , and then either it will fail , as it did in cotton , Or you will be furred to take the final step , which is to limit access to the land . You could say : " Agriculture is a closed industry . No more people shall enter . " Or you could say to the newcomer : " If you eat it , all right , but no more production for sale . There is already production enough . The supply has been carefully adjusted to the demand to protect the price . If you add anything to the supply , it will hurt . the price . On the other hand , it is not fair to the people already here that they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thus a totally regimented agriculture and a realization of that picture which the Secretary of Agriculture , seeing the logical consequences from afar , wrote in his first book  --  on the gatepost of every farm a legal notice of what it may grow and how much , and the price at which it shall be sold , with penalties for disobedience , signed by the AAA . A consummation abhorred , and yet one toward which agriculture is walking with its eyes closed . With more than one tenth of the Federal Government 's total expenditures now going to the aid of agriculture , it is natural to ask what there is to show for it . Have the fortunes of agriculture been improved ? There can be no positive answer . It would be impossible to prove that agriculture 's slice of the pie has been increased at all . If you take the AAA program by itself , as if nothing else had happened , and simply add the AAA checks received by the farmers to the cash proceeds of their crops , as the AAA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can not take the AAA program by itself . The idea that giving the farmer a larger slice would tend to restore prosperity did not stand alone . Parallel was the idea of raising wages at the same time , to increase the buying power of labor . It was all one price delusion . Mr. Wallace 's Wet Drought Mr. Wallace now speaks of " the bargaining-power ' liars which gave workingmen an added income of billions of dollars a year . " These billions of dollars a year added to the industrial pay roll increased the cost of everything the farmer bought ; and so , to a very great extent , perhaps in whole , the increase in the farmer 's income was absorbed and canceled . And thus the greatly advertised intention was defeated . Never was the AAA able td deliver to agriculture the larger slice to which it was entitled . The more it was defeated the farther it went with plans to control production in order to be able to raise prices . Never was it able to control production . Retiring millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as before on fewer acres , the farmers bought more power machinery and intensified their methods , with this effect  --  that at a time when industry was unable to absorb its own unemployed , the labor of millions of men was dispensed with on the soil . Perhaps one half of the total unemployment now existing in the country is so accounted for . But although no one can say for sure how much the economic status of agriculture has been improved , if actually at all , it is certain that if it were suddenly let go of , its state would be , immediately at least , much worse than if the Government had never touched it . However , such a thing is not going to happen . It can not . The Government has gone too far . It has laid its hands directly upon 4,000,000 farms and become responsible for their welfare . There is no kind of sowing , reaping , fattening , bringing forth or increase but it is touched and let or hindered by an AAA form sent out from Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be administered becomes a problem in itself . The AAA says : " If the program is to tit precisely all individual farms , it must be , when taken as a whole . voluminous and complicated , or else , within the framework of national requirements which are few and simple , it must allow county committees the latitude and discretion to adapt the program to a multitude of local variations . Yet , to be successful , a national program has to he operated in every region with a considerable degree of uniformity . This creates the problem . " Quite so . And if it is n't already clear , Mr. Wallace explains it simply . He says : " What we need is greater centralization and decentralization . " Something like a wet drought . For all the AAA has Cost and for all it has done , we have with us the plight of agriculture , still as it was . That is true . Yet simply to make the statement and leave it would be unfair . You must have some idea of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owing to en amazing increase in the productive power of human labor on the soil  --  this from the use of power machinery and the intensive application of seieutilic knowledge  --  we now have many more people on the land than are needed there to produce all the food and raw materials we ourselves can consume , Secondly , American agriculture , having a standard of living higher than that of any other in the world , definitely rejected competition with peasaut labor elsewhere . Once we had put a tariff of forty-two cents a bushel on wheat and twenty-five cents a bushel on corn to protect the American farmer , we were on our way out of the world market as a competitor . It is more clearly to he seen in cotton , Sooner than sell our cotton at a price the world would pay for it , we piled it up by millions of bales in warehouses , and there it is , devouring its own value in storage costs , with the result that other countries are growing more and more cotton , on cheaper Laud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopoly as the world 's supplier  --  a monopoly we could hold only so long as we were able and willing to produce cotton at a cost and sell it at a price that would discourage competition . When , for these reasons , we came to have on the land more people than could be sustained there by their own exertions at what we consider the minimum standard of American living , we fared a very difficult . problem . But it was not an agricultural problem . It was a problem that involved the welfare of our entire economic scheme . Agriculture on these terms was not expansible . Industry was and is expansible . Therefore , the only true solution was for industry to expand more and faster in order to absorb the excess farm population , If the Government were going to intervene at all , the rational thing would have been to increase . if possible , the incentives that move business , to goad and stimulate the profit motive . Unfortunately , beginning with the New Deal , there was a Government that thought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a Government obsessed at the same time with the idea that industry had hogged the national income . Its statisticians divided the total farm population into the total Meanie from farming to show that farm people had a lower income per capita than industrial people , which , of course , was true . Therefore Congress , saving that what it did was to enact a national agricultural policy , passed a series of strange , long , very complicated and sometimes ingenious laws , all with intent to redistribute the national ineome in favor of farm people , by law . These are the laws the AAA was ( Tented to administer . The AAA has been the instrumentality . The scheme has net worked . The reason is that under the free American : system . oral much of it as survives , you Punnet redistribute the Da t itmal income among the different economic groups , taking it from this one and giving it to that one , by law . There is a way to do it . And this is the crux of the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , if you want it , that only a totalitarian government can do it . e " Forget him , " a door guard snarled . " He never existed . His name is not to be spoken . You hear ? " The Chinese raised a thin finger and thin voice , and both shook , " You saw nothing . You heard nothing . You know nothing . Even those words , " lie muttered , " they stole from us and put into the mouths of monkeys . " Gesturing for Hammond to move on , he warned , " Remain silent . " John hoped Helen did n't know that one of the guards , given an order , was following , head down , hands in sleeves . Why ? " Food . nurse , " he said , as , walking , he tried to piece together what had happened . There was n't enough for a decent guess . The restaurant Johnny selected was a small one with a good cook , up a cleft in Chinatown where once there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen . seated , with the owner hovering about , was slipping- off her jacket when the guard padded in ; he stood there , face bleak , exiimining the diners . Merchants at their dinners . Four young Chinese , teapot on table , staring at their emptied bowls as , having eaten , they played the tea game . Parties of tourists eating noodles and chile:enwith-almond . There was the appetizing odor of vegetable oil in the cooking pans , pungent mushroom sauces , ten . While the owner asked if the lady wished tea flavored with jasmine or gardenia , John kept an eye on the guard . The Chinese seemed undecided ; then he shuffled over to the young men . John believed that the tea game , if only for cigarettes , attracted the old fellow . The four sleek heads were he 'll ; one Mall , whose bowl dried too swiftly to win , said that since it had bevome impossible to import fine tea from China , the game was nn longer interesting . Another jeered at him , saying that without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The door guard said , " Fools ! " and the four saw him for the first time . The old man 's left hand clawed out of his sleeve and seized the edge of the telllecloth ; one furious jerk sent the tea things crashing to the floor . The restaurant owner bleated that the young men , knowing nothing , intended no in111 suit . The Chinatown visitors , startled and frightened , jumped from their chairs . " Sit still , " Johnny said to Helen . " That old fellow followed us here from the tong building . I 've learned something . " The guard went to a vacant table , demanding tea , which , scalding hot , he drank , highhinder-fashion , from the : pout . While the young Chinese slipped away , the owner went about . apologizing to his guests ; when he reached Hammond 's table , Johnny said , very low , " Th. maid wishes pearl tea . " The owner began to tremble , Badly upset , he said , " One is already dead because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G'eng Shi drank the last while entertaining a new maid , instead of saving it for the proper purpose .

John said to Helen , Lean forward as if you were working out on me . First , explain tea gambling . It 's an old game . A wager is made ; here it was just packages of cigarettes . Bowls are filled with tea , and then emptied by Leine handed around among the contestants until 7111 have been sipped dry , making sure that the bowls are really empty . Next , the bowls are placed on a table , or , in Japan , Lill the floor , so they can he watched .

" Helen tried to look adoringly at Johnny , because the guard was watching : she said , " What 's 01111 got In do with what happened , Johnny ? " " Plenty . The old man went wild when inferior howls , and pearl tea . supposed to evaporate very slowly , were nurntioned . The restaurant owner said /lint the last pearl tea in Chinatown was improperly used , meaning ; that it was n't saved for gambling . So the tea genie is mixed up in this business . Let 's go back a hit . U'eng Shi , before he died , said that hare 's fur could n't dry first . Well , I 've heard of porcelains called tiger 's masks and duck 's wings , so why not hare 's fur ? Nor was the merchant raving when he said , ' dew alai the thirsty sun .

The G'eng-family guard , sniffing , announced that he was hungry , and a butterfly Canton dish heaped with pork-with-mustard was hastily brought him . Johnny could see that , fur all the Chinese ate noisily , he continued observant . " Your own mess , " John said to Helen , ' ' is much better than it looks . Now , there was gambling , with somebody using the hare's-fur bowl . But there was no pearl tea to put in it . Weise Shi , showing off before a new maid , must 've drunk it . He 's been blamed for that . Why ? Beeause of what the guards said at the tong building . His name is not to be mentioned in Chinatown . We know he lost ? " " And then the highhinder killed him .

Helen ran a caressing finger across the back of Johnny 's hand , and smiled , and looked as abandoned as she was able . " Quit that , " Johnny warned , " or you 'll lie kissed .

" " So do I , " Hammond admitted ; but he also thought about the guard eating with one ham because the other , eon-'sealed in the wide sleeve , held a gun . He wondered if Helen 's ideas about Chinatown were changing . " Everything you 've said makes it look as if the dead man 's been blamed for not having the right tea .

" He was glad he had n't said anything about the gun which the old man kept concealed up his sleeve .
