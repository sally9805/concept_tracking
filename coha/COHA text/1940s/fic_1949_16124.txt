OVER THIS we HEAR the STRAINS OF " LA MARSEILLAISE " , starting with a slow tempo , becoming louder and as the SCENE progresses , taking on an almost furious discordant tone . At the top of the map is SUPERIMPOSED the legend : " FRANCE - 1794 " Suddenly the black dot bursts into flames . The flames spread , enveloping the entire map until the screen is filled with a raging inferno . At the source of the flames a tiny speck becomes visible . As it ZOOMS INTO PROMINENCE we see it is a guillotine . Over the guillotine and the fiery encircling background , the title : " REIGN OF TERROR " rises from the bottom of the screen in flaming letters . As titles FADE OUT : B. LONG SHOT EXT .

Yesterday this book disappeared . &nbsp; CHARLESWhy do n't you make up another one ? &nbsp; ROBESPIERRE ( shaking his head ) You do n't understand . Some of the names are men who work on my own committee . They suspect , yet no one knows for sure whether his name is on the list . It is this fear that gives me control of the Convention . Once they know they 're on the list , they 'll all join forces . I can hold them one by one -- but not as a group . That 's why it is imperative I get this black book back before its contents become known . &nbsp; CHARLESWhom do you suspect of taking it ?  --  29  --  &nbsp; ROBESPIERREI suspect everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Come on up , Charles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a rough shove , send him halfway up the stairs . Madelon turns and DISAPPEARS from view into her room .

How do I know Robespierre has n't sent you ? &nbsp; CHARLESIf Robespierre sent me , I would be Duval . &nbsp; MADELONI 've only your word Duval is dead . Maybe it was part of Robespierre 's plan for you to take Duval 's place . After all , you 're an aristocrat . Barras represents the people who took away everything you once had . Why should you want to help him ? &nbsp; CHARLESBecause I 'm a Frenchman . And there 's only one man who can save France and put an end to this terror . Barras.  --  40  --  &nbsp; BARRAS ' VOICEI wish I were that confident . Charles turns at the sound of the voice . BARRAS APPEARS before a pair of drapes , having just stepped forth .

Fouche strikes a match which casts a feeble light over the desk . The rest of the room is immersed in black shadow .

The match light sputters out in Fouche hand , returning the men to the darkness of the room . &nbsp; FOUCHEIt 's not here . &nbsp; CHARLESIt must be in this room . Fouche strikes another match and lights the lantern suspended from the ceiling . As the wick ignites and the flame rises within the lantern , a hearty glow fills the room disclosing three of the four walls are lined from floor to ceiling with solid bookcases containing innumerable volumes of black-bound books --  all of them exactly alike , bearing the same black leather backing .

Fouche 's hands claw desperately at Charles ' vise-like clench around his throat . Charles chokes him relentlessly . Fouche 's struggles grow weaker , his knees buckle , his jaw sags as he gasps for breath . The pupils of his eyes roll up into his head , leaving only the whites visible .
