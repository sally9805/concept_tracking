In his 53 years , William Grant Still has had as much success with his symphonies , symphonic poems , ballets and chamber works as other U.S. composers ( TIME , June 7 ) and certainly more than any other Negro composer . Nonetheless , he felt there was one unresolved dissonance . " All my life , " says he , " my aim has been opera . " <P> For twelve years , sometimes collaborating with his writer wife , Verna Arvey ( " she takes over where I fail to function " ) , he has toiled away on the composition of seven operas . A slight , sloe-eyed man whose hobby is turning out toys for his two children , he even fashioned miniature sets for his operas in his Los Angeles home . Some of the operas he junked as not good enough , but he saved four . A few years ago , the Metropolitan turned down his favorite , Troubled Island , with a libretto by Negro Poet Langston Hughes , because it called for something the Met could n't assemble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting cast . Says Still : " I have been patient ; others would have given up , but I have exercised an enormous amount of determination . " <P> Emperor , Then Tyrant . Last week , Composer Still 's determination paid off . He sat nervously but happily in an up-front orchestra seat while a sell-out New York City Opera Company audience saw the first performance of a Still opera . <P> The City Opera 's energetic little Director Laszlo Halasz had pulled out all the stops to put on Troubled Island ; he had Haitian Jean Leon Destine and his troupe to do the voodoo dances . He would have had to look far for a better baritone than the Met 's burly Robert Weede to sing the lead role of Jean Jacques Dessalines , the Haitian slave who made himself ( in 1804 ) an emperor , then a tyrant , only to be duped by his mistress and shot in the back . With Marie ( The Medium ) Powers as the rejected wife who came back faithfully to bury her husband , and George Balanchine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have had no trouble at all . <P> Children of Misery . But it did . Poet Hughes 's libretto turned out to have far more peroration ( " Children of misery , tomorrow we must be free , " etc. ) than punch . And Composer Still 's music , sometimes lusciously scored , sometimes naively melodic , often had more prettiness than power . In all , Troubled Island had more of the ' souffle of operetta than the soup bone of opera . With a little seasoning here &; there , some listeners thought , it could even be made into a Broadway hit . Composer Still 's first-night audience liked it fine , anyhow . Exultant , happy , and even more determined after taking six curtain calls with the cast , Still said he planned to keep on trying to write grand opera . Said he : " You do n't realize your mistakes until they stare you in the face . I discovered my weak points . "                 @ @ @ @
