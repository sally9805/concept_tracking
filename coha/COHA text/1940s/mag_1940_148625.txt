Every house in Madrid last week displayed either the flag of Nationalist Spain or a picture of Francisco Franco , or both . Along the broad , tree-lined Gran Via and the busy Calle de Alcala leading to the Puerta del Sol , from new flagpoles fluttered thousands of the red- gold flags , flanked by the emblems of Spain 's single Fascist party , the Falange Espanola , and of the traditionalist Requets . Each pole bore the single word : Paz . <P> For a fortnight Spain and its tubby little Caudillo had been working up to a celebration of the first anniversary of peace . On April 1 , 1939 , Generalissimo Franco issued his last communique , announcing the end of 32 months of civil war . This year , for the first time since the days of Alfonso XIII , Seville celebrated Holy Week with traditional splendor , and to Seville last fortnight went General Franco to give his blessing to Spain 's return to Catholicism. * Back in Madrid , he was acclaimed by thousands of Madrileos in a Falange-sponsored demonstration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3,000 Army officers at luncheon in the Royal Palace . Finally , this week , came the celebration of Peace Day . <P> In a black uniform and the red beret of the Falange , El Caudillo reviewed 15,000 troops marching through the flag-bedecked but still war-scarred streets . Behind the troops marched column after column of Falangists , led by Franco 's brother-in-law Ramon Serrano Suer , chanting their battle song , Face to the Sun . Fighting planes roared overhead . Authoritarian Spain had been told it had much to be happy about . Special editions of Government-controlled newspapers had shown the contrast between Spain of a year ago and Spain of today . Brother-in-law Serrano , who is also Minister of Government ( interior ) , had inaugurated a public-works program calling for the erection of 700 workingmen 's homes in the suburb of Usera . Just announced were a new air service treaty with Italy and a trade pact with Japan . <P> Scars of War . But the truth was that in Spain 's year of peace few war scars had healed . And if anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of looking like after a year or so of total war , Spain was the place to see it . A few miles from the Puerta del Sol , Madrid 's hub , lie the desolate ruins of suburbs where fighting raged for more than two years . The $50,000,000 University City is a pile of rubble , and in West Park , where trenches still remain , only 33 trees are left standing . In Barcelona and Bilbao , Spain 's first and second seaports , the destruction is almost as great . The Government has estimated that it will take at least ten years to carry out the reconstruction program already planned . <P> With economic life upturned by the long struggle , the cost of living has increased 50% in Spain in the past year . Wages have not gone up . Bread lines in Catalonia are longer than during the blockade of the Republic . In Valencia , famed for its arroz dishes , there is a scarcity of rice . Aristocrats dine at Madrid 's Ritz on chick peas . Butter , eggs , meat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be had at all .
