txt A B-50 bomber , Lucky Lady II , returned here this morning from the first non-stop , round-the-world trip ever flown . Taking on fuel in mid-air from B-29 Superfortresses converted to aerial tankers , the big plane , a modified B-29 itself , completed the globe-circling 23,452 miles in ninety-four hours and one minute  --  two hours under four days  --  and two minutes ahead of the time of arrival planned at the take-off . Refuelings , at an undisclosed altitude and at a speed still a military secret , were made easily and without incident at four bases .. The B-29 tankers rose and met the Lucky Lady at Air Force bases in the Azores , Dhahran in Saudi Arabia , the Philippines and Hawaii . The Lucky Lady II left Fort Worth at 12:21 P. M. Eastern standard time , Saturday , Feb. 26 . It reached Lagens Air Force Base in the Azores at 3:55 A. M. Sunday ; Dhahran at 11:30 P. M. Sunday ; Clark Air Base , Manila , at 8 P. M. Monday , and Hickam Air Force Base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane crossed the air base tower at 10:22 A. M. today and again touched earth at 10:31 . Officially , It 's Just Routine The trip , as significant in the matter of distance as the recent three hours and forty-six minute transcontinental flight by the jet bomber XB-47 was for speed , was officially described as . " routine , " which meant it proceeded according to plan . But to the top-level officials here to greet the fourteen tired crewmen , the flight was of considerably more than " routine " importance . They were inclined to regard it as historic , a giant step in the direction ' of an American air power second to none . It means , said Lieut . Gen. Curtis E. LeMay , commanding general of the Strategic Air Command , that the United States Air Force could drop an atomic bomb , taking off from this country , " any place in the world that required the atomic bomb . " He was asked whether a similar method of mid-air refueling could not also be adapted to the fighter escorts . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see why it could n't be done . " During - the war American forces had to take Iwo Jima before they were close enough to Japan to give fighter protection to B-29 's attacking the enemy home islands from Guam . " An Inevitable Step " The relative importance that the Air Force attaches to the flight was made apparent also by the rank of the officials here to sea the plane land . In addition to General LeMay were W. Stuart Symington , Secretary of the Air Force , who flew here from Boston ; Gen. Hoyt 8 . Vandenberg , Air Force Chief of Staff , and Maj. Gen. Roger Ramey , commanding general of the Eighth Air Force . Secretary Symington , a champion of the giant B-36 , the world 's biggest bomber and the Air Force 's chief weapon of strategic warfare ; stated without apparent reluctance today that the new mid-air fueling techniques " turn medium bombers into inter-continental bombers . " This was a category to which the B-36 heretofore had exclusive rights . " In our opinion , " said the Secretary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air power . " The crew of fourteen who. took the Lady around the world seemed ' thoroughly satisfied with the trip . Capt . James Gallagher , of Melrose , Minn. , commander of the plane , told correspondents after the landing that " everything was quite normal . " The planning was excellent , " he said , " and everything worked out very well . " Then he added : " It usually does , as a matter of fact . " The " significant thing " about the flight , he said after a moment 's thought , was that " you can go anywhere in the world at any He and his crew , though freshly shaven for their homecoming , showed signs of fatigue . Refueling experiments began last summer , and the world flight is only the first - of a long series of long-range flights , according to General Ramey . He said that all equipment and logs would be examined and analyzed to enable engineers and planners to improve their operations . The Lucky Lady II was in hourly communication with both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It also kept in touch with posts of the International Civil Aviation Organization and with air-sea rescue stations . A secondary test for the flight was the degree to which security could be maintained , officials said . Although hundreds of persons actually knew of the flight , no word of it escaped to the public . Not even the International Civil Aviation Organization was aware of the real nature of the flight ; whenever air clearance was filed for each leg of the trip , the number of the plane and the pilot 's name were changed . Fire on First Plane The flight was made on a " pointto-point " plan . From its take-off here the flight plan was filed only as far as Lagens Air Force Base , Azores . When the plane passed over Lagens the coordinating officer there filed a new flight plan to the next point , Dhahran . This was done , said the Air Force , to provide a check at each refueling point indicating that the plane had successfully taken on fuel and continued on its course . Lucky Lady II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another B-50 had taken off twenty-four hours earlier , on Feb. 25 , but had to put down in the Azores because of an engine fire . Headquarters here immediately dispatched ? the second plane . The Lady is an operational aircraft carrying the regular twelve .50-caliber machine guns , but nd bombs or ammunition . To stretch fuel capacity and provide an extra margin of safety special gasoline tanks were installed in the bomb bay . It was estimated that the plane had another seven hours and thirty minutes of fuel when she landed . Captain Gallagher said that he and his co-pilots kept the plane between 10,000 and 20,000 feet and that ground speed averaged about 239 miles an hour . Crewmen worked in shifts , remaining on their jobs four to six hours and then taking four to six hours off . It was a double crew , with three pilots . The B-50 , escorten in from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base at Tucson , Ariz , by three B-29 's , made its trip-ending pass over the tower at 10:22 A. M. , and touched down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , but the landing was smooth . Mr. Symington , and Generals Vandenberg , LeMay and Ramey were at the door to meet and congratulate the fliers when they piled out .
