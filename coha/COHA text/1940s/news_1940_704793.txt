txt Italy declared war on Great Britain and France yesterday afternoon , to take effect at one minute past midnight . The land , air and sea forces of the Italian Empire were already in motion . It is a war , as Premier Benito Mussolini announced to the people from his balcony at the Palazzo Venezia at 6 in the evening , against the " plutocratic and reactionary democracies of the West . " For the moment that does not include the United States , but few Italians believe that they will see the war to a finish without havinL the Americans against them . Signor Mussolini expressly excluded Turkey , Switzerland , Yugoslavia , Greece and Egypt as enemies unless they attacked Italy or the Italian possessions . Turkey provides the burning question of the day . Italians are absolutely convinced that the Turks will not move against them and will not honor their agreement with the Allies . It is hoped to confine Italian activity to France , Great Britain and the Mediterranean and to keep the Balkans tranquil . If that can be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Action Discounted Russia has washed her hands of the struggle . The Italians know that any disturbance in the Balkans will immediately bring her in ; but as long as the struggle is confined to the west and south the Soviet will do nothing either to hinder or help . This was told to your correspondent a few hours ago by a very authoritative source , It was emphasized there were no aE eements about furnishing material or anything else , nor any threats or promises . The Italian Ambassador , Augusto Rosso , left in the morning for Moscow and Ivan Gorelkin , Soviet Ambassador , is coming back to Rome , thus ending a long period without such representation . The Italians were anxious to restore full diplomatic relations in this critical period , according to this writer 's informant , and the Russians agreed , but without compromising themselves . It thus appears that Premier Mussolini has embarked on this dangerous venture without really know ? ing what Soviet Russia will do in the long run . President Roosevelt 's speech clearly has come too late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halt this conflict , the Italians say . Whatever brake Mr. Roosevelt may have exercised was overcome by the momentum of the whole Fascist policy . Once it was set in motion , nothing could stop it . The Italians do not lielieve that the United States can affect the issue , whatever it does . They are // DUCE GIVES SIGNAL FOR ITALIAN ENTRY // sure American help can not assume large proportions for many weeks , before which they believe the war will be over . Ever since the beginning of the war Signor Mussolini had said that when he came out on the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia the people of Italy would be speaking . From that moment it was known that when he spoke Italy would already be at war . So when the word finally went around to gather in the Piazza Venezia and all the squares of Italian cities and towns , no one could doubt what the announcement would be . The first resolute words that were spoken ended the long and nervewracking period of suspense , with its dramatic ups and downs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always rising tension . Long ago your correspondent was able to say that Italy would be at war before June 20 , probably between June 10 and 20 . Sometimes it seemed that it was coming sooner , but never was there any hope that Italy would stay out of the war indefinitely . The pressure from the United States appeared to be having effect . In Moscow Soviet spokesmen referred to Italy in strong terms that seemed to indicate Russia was also trying to restrain Signor Mussolini . But American pressure had to he ignored and the Soviet was really offering no objections , except to involvement of the Balkans . As far as France was concerned , it is now clear that the elimination of former Premier Edouard Daladier from the Cabinet , far from being a coileiliatory gesture to Iatly , was the last act of defiance . M. Daladier , it is stated here on high authority , was working with Pierre Laval , former French Premier , to capitulate and make a separate peace , or at least to make generous proposals to Italy . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the end . King Victor Emmanuel , one must presume , was not restraining Premier Mussolini and has put himself at the head of his nation . Immediately after the great gathering in t he Piazza Venezia , the crowd surged up the Quirinal Hill to the palace , where the King awaited them , wearing his field uniform . As Ise stood on the balcony and saluted , the crowd shouted , " Savoie ! " again and again . Already the Premier had spoken of Victor Emmanuel as " His Meje , sty the King and Emperor , who has always interpreted the soul of his Fatherland . " With those words ended any doubts that might have been held about the King 's feelings or actions . He has never thwarted any of the plans or desires of Signor Musolini . Missions First to Learn The diplomatic missions were probably the first to realize that Italy was entering the war , for they received notification early in , ' the morning that the Sicilian Straits had been closed with floating mines during the night . Thus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currents are strong through those straits and some of the mines are being carried away . For the moment that is the only act of hostility that is known with certainty to have taken place . All the wild reports about every place from Corsica to Jibuti , French Somaliland , are still in the realm of potentialities rather than faces . Real hostilities were to begin at midnight , hut , of course , the armed forces were already under way when the Premier spoke . In actual fact , since fighting is impractical in the dark , it was expected the first attack would begin with dawn . The war fever began to grip Rome in the morning and mounted steadily as the news of the great gathering in the Piazza Venezia was passed around . There were still some who hoped it was merely connected with the fact that the day was Navy Day , but that belief was gradually dissipated , more by instinct than through any certain knowledge . Rumors began to fly early in the afternoon that Corfu had been taken , a landing made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Italian troops were on the march into France . Those trying to check on the open secret that the liners Rex , Conte di Savoie and Augustus , which were supposed to sail on specified dates , were being used as troop ships , found the Italian Line offices closed and other sources of information equally uninformative . U. S. Liner Reaches Leghorn The America export liner Exochorda has got through to Leghorn and should be in Genoa by tonight , but her passage through the Mediterranean may well be perilous , as both Leghorn and Genoa are within easy bombing distance of France and Corsica . About 200 Americans have planned to sail on the ExchorSa from Genoa . The first official information of what was coming appeared in the Ministry of War 's announcement . that the blackout regulations were to go into effect . Evening newspapers throughout Italy carried the regulaticns and they were broadcast . Only a " partial blackout " was ordered , in that streets were to be dimly lighted and automobiles to use blue lights . Then Rome began to hum and buzz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Piazza Venezia . Fascist party men went from shop to shop along the Corso Umberto and other main avenues leading into the Piazzia Venezia. ordering the stores to close . t 5 o'clock . Gradually the huge piazza became Sense with persons knowing that a ; neat historic moment had come for Italy . By 6 o'clock fully 100,000 men ind women were packed in the ) pen square and the converging streets . Many thousands of new posters vere scattered over the already coyired walls of Rome 's houses . They ielped to stir feelings a little , but posters have become commonplace n recent weeks . All Ordered to Listen Then the radio began announcing hat at 6 o'clock Signor Mussolini would speak and all citizens were o gather in the main square of ! very city , town and village , where oud-speakers had been set up coniected with installations of the Some radio stations . Dozens of imes during the afternoon an aniouncer came to the microphone to nake that same report . In between nartial music was played . At 5:40 the microphones were tuned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listeners everyehere could hear the cries of the uge crowd , which knew now that it was to listen to the most fateful words that had been heard in Italy since 1915 . Already the evening newspapers in every city had spread the news . Rome 's Lavoro Fascista , for instance , was clear enough with its huge headlines and a photograph of the Premier in uniform . In the Piazza Venezia itself the excitement was rising to a high pitch . Each individual spread his own emotions and was , in turn , caught up in a sensation of mass hysteria that always accompanies such a moment in history . Shouts became screams , and the excess of feeling had to be shown in action as well as by voice . Waves of movement seemed to ripple up and down the surface of the vast crowd . Persons pushed and nudged each other , jumped up and down and turned around meaninglessly . On the radio a German was speaking to the listeners in the Reich , telling them how " the whole Italian people speaks to us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , too , he said , right tinder the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia . At 6 o'clock precisely the Premier appeared on his balcony in his Blackshirt militia uniform , setting off the already aroused emotions of the people as if with an electric charge . Never did he appear more dominating , more sure of himself . Never has his voice been so clear and strong . At another window stood the Foreign Minister , Count Ciano , in the uniform of an airman . He , like Ettore Muti , Secretary-General of the Fascist party , is doubtless going to join his squadron , the " Disperata , " which he led in the Ethiotime today , preparing to take over British , French and South African affairs . The staff also helped various Lat-in-American citizens who had asked aid in getting steamship and railway accommodations . Pope Bows to Decision ROME , June 10 ( UP ) ? The latest expression of Pope Pius indicated that he had become resigned to Italy 's entry into the war and that the Holy See would turn from efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reconstruction after the fighting ends . It was believed the Holy See would maintain its seat at Vatican City , in the heart of Rome , as it is the intention of the Italian Government to maintain the capital as an open city , free of troops , in order to spare Rome 's historical treasures from possible bombing . The Vatican however , has arranged air-raid shelters and will observe blackouts along with Rome . pian war . Because Signor Muti was away , his substitute , Pietro Capoferri , called for the traditional cheer : " Viva Il Duce ! " Despite the loudspeakers , Signor Mussolini 's words could not be on the outer edges of the square . There one found a surprisingly light-hearted attitude , in some eases , toward the grave news he was going to impart . Those who heard well , however , responded with enthusiasm . The announcement that the declaration of war had been handed to the Allies ' ambassadors was cheered tremendously . The mention of the King brought out the greatest enthusiasm of all , except near the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then the response was deafening . " Proletarian and Fascist . Italy is for the third time on her feet , " he cried , " strong , proud and more compact than ever . There is but one categorical watchword binding to all ; it has already penetrated and fired the hearts of all from the Alps to the Indian Ocean : Conquer ! And we will conquer  --  to give finally a long period of peace with justice to Italy , =to Europe and to the world . " People of Italy , rush to your arms and show your tenacity , your courage and your valor ! " At 6:20 P. M. it was over . The Premier was called out to his balagain five or six times , and then the crowd marched off toward the Quirinal Palace , bearing their placards , some of which had single words , like " Tunisia , Jibuti , Corsica , Suez , Malta , Cyprus . " These are the war aims of Fascist Italy , plus one other , expressed this way on one of the placards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracies . " U. S. Embassy Kept Busy ROME , June 10 ( IP ) ?
