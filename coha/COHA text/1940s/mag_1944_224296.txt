Few months ago a quetzal , rare and beautiful national bird of Guatemala , was brought to Guatemala City and put on exhibition in the zoo . The people were indignant ; the quetzal , their symbol of freedom , was said to die if imprisoned. * They waited . Sure enough , the quetzal died . The people nodded their heads . <P> Dollars &; Blood . Visitors from the U.S. have loudly praised Guatemala 's Dictator Jorge Ubico . They have admired Guatemala 's orderliness , its clean-swept streets , its impressive public buildings . But these observers did not see , or else ignored , the real Guatemala behind this faade . Last week , after a stay in Dictator Ubico 's realm , a TIME correspondent reported in detail on one of the world 's most flagrant tyrannies . <P> Back in the days of waning dollar-diplomacy , Dictator Ubico was " elected " President with U.S. blessing . Guatemalans noted that at the same time ( 1931 ) the potent United Fruit Co. wanted a juicy concession which the previous regime had refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first important act as President was to force the Assembly to pass the concession bill . <P> Three years later Ubico entrenched himself , canceled all legal limits on his tenure . Guatemalans never forgot the massacre which took place at that time in which scores of students , workers , prominent citizens suspected of plotting a rebellion were seized in their houses , killed without formality . Hundreds were thrown into prison , tortured , executed . Cried Ubico , admirer of Hitler 's 1934 bloodpurge : " I am like Hitler . I execute first and give trial afterwards . " <P> After this blood bath Dictator Ubico met little serious opposition , although he often refreshed his people 's memory by preventive drizzles of blood . An efficient administrator , he kept tight rein . Plots melted before his pervasive spies , his alert police under shrewd , ruthless Roderico Anzueto . No Guatemalan felt free from secret observation . Today , even Cabinet ministers are under close surveillance . <P> Touring Solomon . Dictator Ubico likes to parade around the country on " trips of inspection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers , a mobile radio station and an official biographer , he tears along the roads at breakneck speed . Landowners greet him with floral arches , sometimes line up their Indian laborers days in advance to await his coming . During brief pauses in the villages , he judges intricate cases of law in a minute flat , fires judges , reverses court decisions , releases prisoners , slaps others in jail . Often he makes up his mind simply by staring at a prisoner . Over the portable radio he gives advice on cooking , fishing , agriculture , engineering , military science , history , economics . He even teaches the natives of Lake Atitln how to handle their boats . <P> The Economist . A firm believer in low wages , Ubico keeps them down by decree . Only skilled workers in the capital city earn as much as 50 a day . Farm workers get 12 to 20 . Food prices in Guatemala are fairly low , but hardly low enough for such wages . Most Guatemalans live in hunger and rags . Ubico often reminds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coincided with local prosperity . Says he : " If the people have money , they will kick me out .
