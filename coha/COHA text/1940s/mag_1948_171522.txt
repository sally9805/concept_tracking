The pale , ailing little priest prepared for his speech as usual , by spending four or five hours in concentrated prayer . This time , he fainted as he knelt in prayer , and had to be carried to the rostrum . There his strength returned and the words poured from him with such power and passion that many of his hearers wept . <P> To Father Riccardo Lombardi such experiences as this one in Sicily are part of the day 's work . But the day 's work to Father Lombardi smacks of the miraculous , for he feels himself to be a man possessed . " It is not I who do these things , " he says , repeatedly striking his breast with his white , bunched fingers . " It is Jesus . " And all up &; down Italy , in the big cities and the little towns , the people believe that it is Jesus indeed . <P> Wherever Father Lombardi goes , the crowds turn out . In Milan and Palermo , crowds of 120,000 to 140,000 have stood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heckle him-to " burst the bubble of Father Lombardi " - they often find themselves unable to speak ; sometimes they are moved even to renounce their political faith . And Italians who have remained cynically on the political sidelines are stirred by this unpretentious priest as no one has stirred them since Saint Francis of Assisi . <P> " See the Results . " Riccardo Lombardi was born 40 years ago in Naples to a devout , middle-class family from Piedmont . He began preaching while still a student at the University of Padua ( he estimates that he has talked to a round total of 4,000,000 people ) . His favorite authors are the two great Catholic mystics , Saint Teresa of Avila and Saint John of the Cross , and in his tiny , bare , blue-walled room in Rome 's Via Ripetta he spends most of his time praying . During his travels he tries to keep himself always " in communion with God . " <P> Says he : " I find strength , not in books , not in reasoning , nor even in feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' presence . I ca n't explain it because it 's supernatural and I ca n't put it into words . . . . Look at the works , see the results . In 1944 I traveled through Italy without making any arrangements . With no money . There were no trains . No regular bus routes . I never arrived late at a single lecture . That ca n't be coincidence for a whole year . It 's Jesus that does it . " <P> " God Wills It . " Jesuit Father Lombardi believes that the Jesus who came to earth at the decline of Roman civilization , and again manifested Himself in Saint Francis at the close of the Dark Ages , is about to come again to the troubled and despairing world . To prepare the way , Father Lombardi this month is launching his biggest undertaking-a " crusade " which he calls fronte dell'amore ( the front of love ) . Love is his rallying cry and his bridge between the spiritual and the political worlds : " Men and women , arise ! A new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the age of Christian solidarity when wealth will be voluntarily and freely bent to the common good without the need of violence but through love . . . . Dieu le veult.
