If there was any doubt left , Citation proved last week that he is a great race horse-probably the greatest since Man o ' War . <P> He stumbled at the start of the $100,000 Belmont Stakes , but that only lent a touch of showmanship to his performance . An ambitious upstart named Faraway ran with him for seven furlongs before Citation killed him off . Once out front , Jockey Eddie Arcaro let Citation roll . He won by eight lengths-and became the eighth horse in history to win the triple crown ( Kentucky Derby , Preakness and Belmont ) . His time for the mile-and-a-half , 2:28 1/5 , equaled Count Fleet 's for the swiftest Stakes ever run . Said Arcaro afterwards : " Too bad I did n't know that . <P> 1 might have let him run for a couple of more jumps at the head of the stretch . " <P> Citation has won more money in today 's inflated market ( $544,700 ) than any horse before him at his age . Would he be another Man o ' War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who last week became the first jockey ever to win the triple crown twice , was n't selling Citation short . Said he : " What a horse ! He 's terrific . I still do n't know how fast he can run . "
