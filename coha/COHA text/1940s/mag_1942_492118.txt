20 March 28,1942 EVERY once in a while someone writes to Dr. Albert Coombs Barnes asking him for details concerning his discovery of Argyrol . To one of these letters received not long ago , Barnes replied : " I first made the product in 1778 while serving as a private in the Colonial Army at Valley Forge . The weather was severe , we had little food and less clothing and we were devastated by disease . It was my ambition to relieve that suffering that prompted me to make the product and earn the encomiums of my glorious chief , General George Washington . All the apparatus which I employed in making my first experiments and completing the finished product are on exhibition in General Washington 's headquarters at Valley Forge . A plaque above the apparatus duly commemorates my achievement . " It did n't occur quite that way . The summer of 1900 had been very hot in Heidelberg and this was the hottest day of the summer . But Barnes doubts that the heat had anything to do with the memorable incident of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student in chemistry . He was drinking beer with another student and talking about nothing in particular . Suddenly there came to him , like a great light , the method for making Argyrol , which was to bring him a fortune of many millions . For eight years he had been mulling over in the back of his mind by what means a silver compound could be evolved for use as an antiseptic which would not have the burn of silver nitrate . " All that time the idea was maturing in my subconscious , " he says . It just happened that while I was in the beer garden my subconscious was ready to deliver it . That 's all there was to it . If I had been in bed asleep , my subconscious would have waked me . My subconscious is very inconsiderate . It usually comes along with ideas at four o'clock in the morning . " His subconscious had n't done all the work on Argyrol , however . Barnes now knew what he must do to get Argyrol . The problem of how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Barnes returned as quickly as possible to the United States and got busy . His laboratory was what he had rigged up in the basement of the family home in South Philadelphia when a boy in high school . His mother remembered the months after he came back from Europe as a period in which he always seemed to be pushing her cooking aside to boil evil-looking chemicals on her kitchen stove . Translating the prescription he had received from his subconscious into reality was a long process . Meanwhile he had to have a job . A chemical company where he had worked before going to Germany hired him again as consultant . All his spare moments were occupied with his Argyrol experiment . He kept working on it even while on his honeymoon in Europe in 1901 . When he and his bride moved into their home in the Overbrook section of Philadelphia , Barnes set up his laboratory in the kitchen and spent most of his evenings there . Barnes had asked one of his professors at Heidelberg to recommend a capable chemical technician . The professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he induced to follow him to ? America . The doctor explains that he needed a technician to supervise the manufacture of Argyrol . " An architect does n't build the houses he designs , " Barnes says . " An experimentally proved thing had to be adjusted to the mechanics of doing it on a big scale . I did n't know how to do that , just as a household cook would n't qualify as a chef in a large restaurant . " The German had arrived in Philadelphia in 1900 , Barnes getting him a job with the same chemical company which employed him as consultant . The doctor discussed his experiments with the technician , but says the German had only a technical hand in perfecting Argyrol . By 1902 , Argyrol was ready for the market ; the two of them forming a partnership toward which Barnes provided all the capital ? $1600 . With what remained after buying the essential equipment , they hired eight rooms in a small hotel in West Philadelphia . Argyrol 's success was immediate and sensational ; the first year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one twenty-seventh of that . The doctor 's own acute sense of promotion helped . He gave a bottle to the late Dr. Edward Martin , a nationally known surgeon who had been one of his teachers in medical school , asked Doctor Martin to test it , and when the latter reported that it was an antiseptic superior to any other , pleaded that Martin put this in writing . Reproducing this endorsement , Barnes mailed out copies by the thousands to the medical profession . The next year he went to Europe , distributed Argyrol samples in London , Glasgow , Dublin , Berlin and Paris to eminent surgeons and physicians , and brought back a sheaf of such endorsements , with which he circularized the profession nationally . Thenet profit in 1903 was $100,000 ; in 1904 it was still higher and offices were opened in such places as London , and Sydney , Australia . " It was in the bag then , " he says . Each year the income from Argyrol increased , and Barnes at thirty-five was a millionaire . During this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch passing freight trains of the Pennsylvania Railroad . He strould note the numbers on the cars . " I would see , for instance , 118,250 , " he says , " and I would say , ' Pooh , I got that much money . ' Then one would come along with , for instance , 382,198 , and I would say , ' Pooh , I got that much too . ' Then one would go by with , for instance , 778,538 , and I would say , ' I 'll have that much before long . ' Finally I had to give up the game because boxcar numbers did n't run high enough . " Argyrol has several uses in medicine , chiefly in combating infections of the mucous membrane . One of these is in the treatment of colds and allied infections of the nose and throat . A more dramatic use is to prevent gonorrheal ophthalmia , an infection of the eye which is the greatest cause of infant blindness . A few drops are put into the eyes of most new-born babies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a preventive and cure of gonorrhea . It cut down the prevalency in the United States and kept the disease in check in the AEF during World War I. The formula still is secret , thanks to a crafty move by its inventor . He talked about it with me recently in general terms , saying , " I took a proteid which Color Photographs by Pinto Brothers ( Cr // exists in nature  --  an example would be the white of an egg . Then by a chemical process I converted that into another proteid , a hitherto unknown product . The final proteid I mixed with silver to produce Argyrol . How I made the synthetic proteid may be revealed after my death . " He got the name from the Greek word for silver , argyros . He is also the inventor of a tonic , Ovoferrin , which means , roughly , eggs and iron . Ovoferrin was n't the spectacular success that Argyrol was , but it has been a very good money-maker , at that . He patented neither Argyrol nor Ovoferrin , registering their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Argyrol as a patent medicine , or to himself as a patent-medicine man . Argyrol was an important scientific discovery and he would not demean it , he says , by patenting it . There was another and more practical consideration , however . A patent expires after seventeen years , when anyone can get access to the formula . By not patenting Argyrol , Barnes did not have to reveal the formula , in the first place , nor since 1919 , when his patent would have run out . There is nothing to prevent others from making Argyrol under another name ? if they only knew its composition . That Barnes did n't give the formula to the medical profession , instead of manufacturing it himself and amassing millions , has brought him some criticism . Barnes grows a little violent when this is mentioned . If he had done as his critics urged , he asserts , a commercial manufacturer would have got hold of Argyrol . " The receipts then , " he says , " would have been spent for yachts and subsidizing chorus girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefited by that . " Barnes ( continued on Page 781 protests that he has no personal fortune ; that it has all gone into art and education . In 1908 , he and his German partner having disagreed , Barnes instituted court action for a dissolution of the partnership . Barnes paid the German several hundred thousand dollars for his interest in the firm , and launched the A. C. Barnes Company on his own . There has never been another business like the A. C. Barnes Company . For the sake of the equilibrium of American industry , it is probably just as well . Barnes had bought the hotel building for $8000 , and he now decorated the walls with fine paintings . The A. C. Barnes Company did n't have a boss . " We never needed a boss , " says Barnes . " We had a common respect for the personality of each employee . Each participant evolved his or her own method of doing a particular job in a way that fitted into the common needs . " The personnel numbered then only eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it never exceeded twenty-five . The manufacture of Argyrol was rather simple . Although in its final form it is a liquid  --  druggists make it into a solution  --  it goes from the factory in the form of little crystals . The pouring of the crystals into bottles Barnes enjoyed particularly . That was because it was done to the rhythm of Negro spirituals . All hands , he included , joined in the singing . If the system of education in the raw he put into effect had been followed generally , it is conceivable that factory workers in the United States now would all be savants and aesthetes . Barnes felt that no work day should be longer than six hours . As a concession to other businesses , however , he kept the plant open for the regulation eight hours . But he decreed that the employees would knock off from 12:30 to 2:30 each day and devote themselves to the study of philosophy and psychology , with the teachings of William James and John Dewey their guide and inspiration . It did n't bother Barnes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William James with Jesse . One of the Negroes could neither read nor write . The two others had attended sporadically the lower grades of school . Two of the women had not done better . The three other women were graduates of a small-town high school . One of the latter . Miss Mary Mullen , showed a flair for James and Dewey and was placed in charge of the seminar . Miss Mullen later became an associate director of the Barnes Foundation , the art school Barnes endowed . Philosophy With a Punch The workers went after knowledge with gusto . Instruction was by very informal discussion . The atmosphere of the schoolroom was avoided . Grammatical blunders were passed over without notice . Psychology was taught simply and painlessly . " It was shown , " Miss Mullen recalls , " how intelligence is capable of changing the toil by which a livelihood is gained into free self-expression , and so transforming drudgery into art . " Barnes testifies , " We devoted two years to William James , starting with his Talks to Teachers , then progressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Religious Experience , most of which we found comparatively easy going . But we foundered on his Radical Empiricism . About this time Dewey 's How We Think was published , and it brought a means of clarifying and adapting what we had read . Bertrand Russell won their hearts with his Free Man 's Worship , and Santayana was soon in the ascendancy with his Sense of Beauty , the pretty thorough study of which was responsible for our trying to learn something about painting . " One of the men , Johnny White , had some skill as a boxer . " We put William James into his boxing , " says Barnes , " and that enabled him to become a challenge ' or the bantamweight championship . " Johnny was booked for a match in Philadelphia , the winner to have a crack at the title . Barnes put on the gloves with Johnny at the factory to get him in shape . " I trained him , " says the mentor , " in a technique that had but three simple fundamentals : One . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper . Three . Do n't do anything foolish . And that 's all there is to William James . " The staff turned out in a body to watch Johnny , primed to a fine edge on William James , fight the other fellow , who had unimaginatively relied on road work and bag punching . William James backed up Johnny superbly on the offensive , but on the defensive he was inadequate . There was nothing in William James to take the dynamite out of a knockout rignt uppercut Johnny 's untutored opponent landed on the chin . Barnes denies that William James failed in this test . " The other fellow , " he says , " just happened to know the psychology of William James better than Johnny , although probably not by that name . " Personal perplexities were taken up at the seminar and rationalized through psychology . A Negro named Jake presented a provocative case . The other men reported , " Jake beats his wife . " Barnes told them , " We wo n't bother about that as long as he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show up for work ; Jake had been arrested . It was n't on the complaint of Mrs. Jake ; neighbors had been disturbed by Mrs. Jake 's screaming . Barnes analyzed the situation for the fledgling psychologists and philosophers : " If Jake beats his wife , and she likes it and does n't complain , we do n't approve of that , but we do n't think it is any reason to hold him up to scorn . Jake is a sadist and his wife is a masochist . " This , Barnes recalls , was a perfectly logical explanation to them , and Jake was restored to respectability . Problems in Pegs But Jake was n't the only problem for psychological consideration . " One of the Negroes , " Barnes relates , " had a conflict between his desire to become a chauffeur and his liking for the job he held with us . We gave him the privilege of oiling and adjusting and tinkering with one of our automobiles , and his self became integrated . A mature woman employee had so much energy she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapping bottles . We removed the contention by placing her in charge of the stock and shipping , where a new motor co-ordination is necessary nearly every minute . " One of the men , however , stopped Barnes completely . The worker gave his previous employment as barbershop . One day Barnes asked him if he thought he could cut Barnes ' hair . He said he could . Barnes got scissors and clippers and the Negro proceeded with the haircut in Barnes ' office . When he was finished Barnes looked in the mirror . What he saw frightened even him . He turned on the man . " What the hell did you ever do in a barbershop ? " he demanded . " I shined shoes , " said his man , simply . Barnes set up a trust fund of $250 , - 000 for the employees . The money was invested in municipal bonds , and the ( Continued on Page 801 employees received the income in monthly bonuses . Although the company was sold in 1929 to the Zonite Products Corporation  --  which moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. C. Barnes Co. ? Barnes ' employees still get about $125 a month each from the trust fund , and will for the rest of their lives , though they may have other jobs . Business bored Barnes . Sitting around watching the money pour in was monotonous . One day he said , " I 'm through with this thing , " and announced his retirement . He had lunch at the Bellevue-Stratford and went to a matinee . By evening he was wretched with idleness , and the next day he was back at the office . For a while he had a chance to enjoy his natural abilities as a cop . Complaints came in from doctors here and there that Argyrol was n't having the proper results , or , worse , was having dangerous results . It developed that a fraudulent Argyrol was being made and sold with the connivance of some druggists . Barnes organized a sort of G-man squad and traveled the country . He discovered a bootleg Argyrol combine operating in New York . " I called on the New York police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was going on . I said I 'd like a search warrant for an East Side drugstore . The commissioner said ; ' I 'll give you Pete . He 's better than a search warrant . ' So it turned out . We asked the druggist where he kept his stock of Argyrol . When he said he had none , Pete floored him , we ran down into the cellar , and there we found and confiscated one hundred thousand bottles of fake Argyrol . " It was an easy step from Argyrol to art for Barnes . He believes all things in life are related and has always linked his successive phases of activity . However dissimilar they might seem to someone else , he has managed to carry a connection progressively over from one experience to another . Argyrolinto-art was uncommonly easy because he maintains that there is no distinction between science and art , anyway . Barnes had begun to paint at the age of six and had kept at it until his twenties , when he had painted 106 canvases . One day he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did it to escape further self-deception , " he explains . A Painting Credo He never again put brush to canvas , but his thwarted love of painting persisted and , as the money continued to roll in , he decided to make a new career for himself as collector and connoisseur as steps on the way to realizing his dream of establishing something new in art education . Putting Nelle Mullen , sister of Mary Mullen , in charge of the company , he sailed for Paris . For nearly thirty years thereafter , except during World War I , he made two trips a year abroad , staying three or four months in summer , a month in winter . In getting his bearings as a collector , Barnes bought a lot of stuff that he shudders now to think about . He long since has rid himself of most of these relics , keeping a few to mortify himself , but hiding them from other eyes . Modern art then was new and sneered at by museums , most dealers and critics . Instinctively the American disagreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unfair to suppose that his enthusiasm for the March 28,1942 new art had no better source than mulishness . The late William Glackens , a good and an unconventional artist , had been a classmate of Barnes at Central High School , Philadelphia , and the two had played on the same semipro baseball team . Calling upon him on one of his early returns from Paris , Barnes said , " Glack , you 're a painter and I 'm not , but I think azanne , Renoir , Picasso , Matisse , Degas , Monet and two or three other young French artists are a damned sight more gifted than the fashionable painters and will be remembered long after them . They have n't been recognized yet because the art officials are politicians and humbugs . I want you to go to France and buy for me what , in your opinion , are representative paintings of these artists . " The Old Masters ' Sons With the $20,000 Barnes gave him , Glackens returned with twenty pictures comprising a cross section of the newer French painting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a significant , to him , discovery : the distortions practiced in greater or less degree by all these artists , which disgusted the Paris bigwigs , were actually in the great tradition of Titian , Michelangelo , Tintoretto , El Greco and others of the old masters . He satisfied himself that the French moderns were the legitimate successors of the masters , their fashionable rivals so many stupid daubers . The reader will have his own opinion as to that , but , practically , it was a smart conclusion . Seabiscuit once ran in a $2000 claiming race and went unclaimed . Had some horseman had the discernment to see a future champion in the cheap claimer and snapped the horse up for $2000 , he would have been no wiser or luckier , as you prefer , than was Barnes . From then on the Argyrol money was down on the French moderns . And the French moderns won , with Barnes their proprietor , their angel , their champion . Barnes usually has shied away from disclosing where he got his pictures and for how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was preparing an article on an American artist and asking if it was true , as she had heard , that Barnes had paid the highest price ever paid for a painting by this artist , and if he still had it in his gallery . Barnes answered : " The equivalent of asking me to confirm rumors would be asking a lady to make a statement for publication if the rumor is true that she bought the most expensive pair of panties ever sold by Lit 's Philadelphia department store ' and if she is still wearing them . " The fact is that Barnes acquired many important pictures at prices that amounted to larceny . He picked them up in Left Bank garrets , in cafes where the more impecunious young artists had left them in settlement for food and wine , and in junk shops . Barnes knew what he wanted  --  and where to find it . Once he went into a small jewelry store to have his watch fixed . On a pile of rubbish in a corner he saw a painting by Henri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars . The jeweler , who had never heard of le douanier Rousseau , said that the artist had left it with him in payment for the repair of a clock . It is now regarded as one of the best of all Henri Rousseau 's paintings , and Barnes says he could sell it handily today for $40,000 . In a junk shop Barnes found
