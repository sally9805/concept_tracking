In the coastal jungle of Vera Cruz state , bulldozers chewed their way last week through rain forests and matted vines . They were clearing a path across the waist of Mexico for an 800-mile-long fence . Its purpose : to check the northward spread of aftosa ( foot- &-mouth; disease ) , which had already infected about one-sixth of Mexico 's 13 million head of cattle and brought nightmares to Texas ranchers . <P> Other U.S.-aided attempts to wipe out aftosa by killing all infected and exposed cattle had bogged down against the iron-hard resistance of the Mexican campesinos ( TIME , Dec. 8 ) . So slaughter was replaced by quarantine and vaccination ; a part of the substitute plan is the fence now abuilding . From a starting point on the Gulf of Mexico , it will run across the states of San Luis Potosi and Zacatecas , then southwest to the Pacific at Puerto Vallarta . North of the line , which is guarded by more than 15,000 Mexican soldiers , 1,000 Mexican and U.S. technicians , there is no aftosa . <P> South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec ( where another , shorter fence will be built ) , veterinarians are experimenting with aftosa vaccines shipped from The Netherlands and Argentina . If they work against the Mexican virus , and if the government can persuade skeptical campesinos of the necessity of sticking a needle into their animals every six months , Mexico hopes at least to control aftosa . U.S. experts are bearish , point out that the quarantine-vaccination method has failed in Europe . Like most U.S. cattlemen , they believe that the only cure for aftosa is wholesale slaughter .
