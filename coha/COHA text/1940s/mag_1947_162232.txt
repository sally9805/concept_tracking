By 9 a.m. the doorman guarding the gallery on the seventh floor of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange began turning visitors away . Inside , jampacked spectators looked down to the trading floor where traders were clustering , half an hour early , around the octagonal steps of the coarse-grains pit . Since September 1943 there had been ceilings on oats and barley and trading had all but died . Now a free market had returned . <P> In the " pulpit " stood Quotation Recorder Bill Poulden watching the clock . At 9:30 , as the grain pits were opening in Chicago and Minneapolis , Poulden rang the gong and the pit burst into a bedlam of shouting and arm-waving . <P> Up Goes Grain . Tall , aggressive John McDowell , Manitoba legislator-farmer who had campaigned for ending controls and reopening the Exchange , shouted down the rest with his stentorian " Ninety-five for May oats .

Many farmers were angry because ceilings were lifted after most of their harvest had been sold . Others who had gambled on the lifting of ceilings and withheld their crop were sitting pretty , with paper profits of 20 to 35 a bushel . <P> Directors of the United Farmers of Alberta demanded that the Dominion Government halt Exchange trading in coarse grains , put all buying through the Canadian Wheat Board ( which now buys virtually all wheat ) . In Saskatchewan , Agriculture Minister James Gardiner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He was confident that if there were abuses in Exchange trading , the Government would ask Parliament for authority to do what U.F.A. asked . <P> Livestock feeders had been worried over the end of ceilings , and even more because many grain growers refused to sell before prices went up .
