His landscapes of a single lone omb tree , with zinc-white rinsings of the moon , his gaucho dances at dusk in orange groves or tiled patios , his dames of the epoch of Rosas gossiping in red dresses on crimson sofas in scarlet damask rooms , his nocturnes of the old market or the environs of Malvin , his two wonderful paintings of the murder of Facundo Quiroga on the diligence , and above all the strange series of Negro customs , candombe dancers , wakes , the mongrels chasing the funerals on foot , the parades and festivals are an inexhaustible pageant of a rich past , the best of which are splendidly painted . <P> This is a description of the work of the late great Uruguayan painter Pedro Figari , one of whose pictures was on view last week at Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art .
