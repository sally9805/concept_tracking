and for discussion of its aims . They are the essence of what we are fighting for . The administration itself must also redouble its efforts to make the war agencies really efficient . Are Jesse Jones and the Federal Loan Administration ob ? structing a necessary expansion of productive capacity ? If so , he should be replaced or brought into line . Army officers in charge of procurement who have not the capacity to handle such a big job must give way to a competent agency of supply . We are now far better prepared than at the beginning of any other war in our history ? but so are our enemies . ' We must manage , not merely to produce more and more , but to produce enough to win . That accomplishment is still far ahead of us . Finally -- though this necessity seems remote at pres ? ent ? we must be ready to win the peace after we have won the war . Shall we repel invasion only to suc ? cumb to depression and misery in our internal econ ? omy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world for peace ? We are late in preparing to meet the assault on democracy . We do not dare be equally late in knowledge of how to make democracy fit for survival . Just as we were going to press , The New Republic received from Representative Thomas Eliot of Massa ? chusetts , who has an article elsewhere in these pages , a brief , straightforward account of the scene last Mon ? day in the House . We offer this eye-witness report as a rendering of personal history in an hour when the personal histories of 130,000,00o Americans merged into one : Perhaps this should be written by someone who was in the Congress in 1917 . I was not ; I can not make com ? parisons . But in the nature of things , there is little to compare . Our territory and our people have been ruthlessly attacked ; and that is all there is to it . That is the way practically all members of Congress are feeling today , and the President 's address struck that single , simple note . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was greeted with whole-souled , solemn , fervent applause . The few shouts ? which did not begin until after a minute or so of clapping ? seemed perhaps out of place ; a falsetto rebel yell issued only from the throat of a bellicose Pennsylvanian . One Democrat sat silent through it all ; he was , in fact , from Missouri ? and after the President had spoken , he voted " Aye . " ? As for the President , the toss of the head was there , but not the smile . The pictures do not show Wilson , on April 2 , 1917 , as having a lined and almost haggard face ? that was to , come later . But Wilson had not been up all night , listening to reports of American battleships sunk and Ameri ? can lives lost . He spoke then of making the world safe ; but you knew that , today , Roosevelt was speaking of making America safe and keeping America free . Everywhere there was a quiet relief that unity had come upon us , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt left the rostrum , just for a mo ? ment the head went up and the chin shot out . Some of us were more moved at this moment than at any other time , for we felt that this man had fought hard to win this struggle without war and now was starting undismayed to lead in a more desperate conflict . There were some speeches in the House before the vote was taken and perhaps that was advisable . Speakers seemed wisely selected ? the two party leaders , two women , an American of Irish descent , a New York interventionist , a Southerner , and a leading isolationist . Most of the speeches were reasonably free of the first person singular ; those of Mr. McCormack and Mr. Bloom were the briefest and the best . The roll call reflected both the quiet solemnity and the new-found unity . Few men shouted " Aye " ; most of us spoke it quietly , for it was a vote which many had never expected to cast . When Miss Rankin voted " No " there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galleries ; it was made louder by some members earnestly saying " sh-sh . " I heard no expressions of anger at Miss Rankin , and several of admiration for her courage , if not for her realism . NVe knew that we had to cast that vote , and that we could not possibly guess to what green pastures or what barren ruins the path we now take would lead us . But by being true to our heritage , we may retain the best things in our past . Words to Remember Millions of words have been spoken on'the air since the fighting began in the Pacific ? many of them fool ? ish , some calm and helpful , some stirring . Of all the words none has exceeded in quiet good sense , in deep human understanding and in democratic pride those spoken by Mrs. Roosevelt on Sunday night . Hers were words to remember , and we reprint excerpts from a broadcast that deserves the widest attention : We know what we have to face and we know that we are ready to face it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women in the country tonight .... You can not escape anxiety , you can not escape the clutch of fear at your heart , and yet I hope that certainty of what we have to meet will make you rise above these fears . Whatever is asked of us , I am sure we can accomplish it ; we are the free and unconquerable people of the U. S. A. To the young people of the nation , I must speak a word tonight . You are going to have a great opportunity ; there will be high moments in which your strength and ability will be tested . I have faith in you . I feel as though I were standing upon a rock , and that rock is my faith in , my fellow citizens . Now that war has come we need the spirit of Churchill , who less than a month ago , and after Britain 's greatest victories , said : " I have never given assurances of a speedy or cheap victory . On the contrary , I have always said that the hardest moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead . " If the people of Britain can suffer their homes to be destroyed , their cities to be ruined , their armies to be defeated many times and still respond with pride to these words , then so we can . Americans , with good reason , like to think of them ? selves as the best informed people on earth . They de ? mand all the news and , whenever possible , they want to get it before it happens . Obviously they now face a world in which news will often be hard to get . In wartime censorship of military news is clearly neces ? sary , and certain restraints on the press are to be ex ? pected . As a matter of fact , some voluntary restraints have been in effect for many months , and the transition from the semi-war state to the total-war state should be relatively easy for the press and its readers ? provided the censors do an intelligent job . The sole object of that job should be to prevent military secrets from falling into the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the democratic spirit and democratic traditions . For practical reasons , moreover , it is wise to tell the people as much as possible . Nothing is so likely to damage this nation 's morale as the feeling that the government is holding back information without warrant . Ameri ? cans are so constituted that they would rather have bad news than no news at all . In an atmosphere of offi- cial silence rumors will breed fast and they will feed on the kind of half-truths that the Axis may be ex ? pected to send us over the short waves . The main thing for the censors to remember is that Americans can be trusted . They are a mature people who have made good use of freedom . It is freedom that they are fight ? ing for . If the function of censorship is to withhold only news of importance to the enemy , so is it the function of press and radio to supply military news only of tested value to the public . Our commercial radio , for example , has proved its ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still to be seen . Sunday was a gala day for the networks ; they " dedicated " them ? selves to a twenty-four-hour-a-day coverage of military news , with commentators on the air from every quarter of the nation . Much of the material was repetitious ? and understandably so , since it was important to inform the many who had not heard the earlier broadcasts . But much , too , was of absolutely no value , impressive only as an example of radio 's dexterity in going the rounds of its commentators . Now that the first surprise is over , we hope this kind of fireworks will be discour ? aged by the radio heads . A few simple statements of facts at regular intervals will be of far greater value than a hodgepodge of fact and rumor , of assertions followed by denials . Public calm is essential to united action and can be helped enormously by prompt deliv- ery of the best available news . Ambitious seeking after " coverage , " at the expense of accuracy and discrimina ? tion , is national hysteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of convincing the authorities that censorship should be applied on a broad scale . Japanese in America The inability of the average American to distinguish between a Chinese and a Japanese has led the Chinese in this country to devise ready ways of identifying themselves . In Los Angeles Chinese will wear dis ? tinctive buttons ; in Seattle they will carry identification cards . The reason can be understood , and the Chinese are to be congratulated on their ingenuity . We hope , however , that they are taking an unnecessary preven ? tive step . If Americans are as sane as there is ground for believing they are , they will not persecute or harass the Japanese in the United States . As we all know , many Japanese have lived long and usefully in this country and in all senses are entitled to protection and respect . The government authorities can be trusted to deal with Japanese who do not fall into that cate ? gory . We can get along better without the hysteria of 1917 . Last Monday 's newspapers , understandably enough , gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed by the President to arbitrate the union-shop issue in the captive coal mines . The board , with Mr. Fairless of U. S. Steel dissenting from the opinion of Dr. John R. Steelman and John L. Lewis , did the proper and indeed the expected thing in grant ? ing the United Mine Workers the union shop . As Dr. Steelman pointed out , the UMW had organized 95 percent of the 53,000 captive miners and 99.5 percent of all the miners in the nation . Under the circumstan ? ces the UMW was fully entitled to the union shop . The New Republic strenuously objected to the means by which Mr. Lewis attempted to obtain the union shop last month . The means , a strike that threatened the victory program , were wholly wrong . The end was right , and now it has been obtained by means to which exception can not be taken . The activities in the United States and the Western Hemisphere of German and Italian fifth-column groups have been pretty well exposed , but spokesmen for Franco 's Spain have attracted little attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ category . It ought to be noted , none the less , that representatives of the Phalanx , now Spain 's only legal party , are at work in this country and in Latin America . The Pha ? lanx 's dream is that one day Spain 's empire in the New World will fiourish again and while awaiting that day ( Hitler 's triumph in Europe is to usher it in ) , the Phalanx seeks busily to win converts to the cause and ideas of the Franco regime and fascism in general . Most of its proselyting is done in Latin America , but the Phalanx has not neglected this nation . It pub ? lishes magazines and a tabloid paper and holds meet ? ings and raises funds under various auspices . All this is on the record . But unless the Phalanx differs from other Fascist organizations , a great deal may be going on off the record . Americans have the right to know . The New York Post has moved that the Department of Justice investigate Phalanx activities . The New Re ? public seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that American-made tanks are the finest of their kind in use on any battlefront brings to mind a suggestion we heard made recently by a good friend ' of labor . This suggestion was that the morale of American workers could be infinitely bettered if they were enabled to learn in some detail how tanks or any other piece of fighting machinery made in their factories had stood up in actual combat . The practical obstacles to carrying out that suggestion may readily be seen , but the idea remains a good one . If the work ? ers in X factory could know just how their tanks had fared in , say , the action around Tobruk , the war would be brought home to them more sharply than it could be in any other way . And a sense of achievement might supersede that ineffectualness which many Americans seem to feel . The week began at 2:26 P.M. , Eastern Standard Time , Sunday , December 7 , when WOR interrupted a broadcast of the Giants-Brooklyn football game in New York City to say that Japan had struck at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many months members of Congress and their constituents had tried , most of them with great sincer ? ity , to decide whether this particular act or that one was , in a favorite word of congressional debaters , " tan ? tamount " to war . There was great division of opinion about the width of the oceans which border the North American continent . There was a nationwide hope that war , which all saw as inevitable , could be qualified by a phrase or a word or a reservation of some kind . The echo of the bombs that exploded on United States soil at Pearl Harbor silenced the qualifying word . The continents closed . The argument ended . It was war . The ' Senate recognized the fact of war unanimously , 82 to o . Absentee members concurred . The House voted , the declaration 399 to I , Miss Rankin of Mon ? tana , one of the two present members of the House who opposed the declaration of war against Germany in 1917 , again being unable to overcome her scruples against fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most Americans respected her . President Roosevelt signed the joint resolution at 4:10 . Individual Americans responded according to their natures , which are various . General Robert E. Wood said , " Of course the America First Committee will support the war . " This apparently was the end of:the Committee . Senator Wheeler said , " Everyone , regard ? less of party affiliations , must back up the administra ? tion . " Senator Nye observed bitterly that " the United States has done its utmost to provoke a quarrel with Japan . " Charles A. Lindbergh belatedly advocated sup ? port of the government . The New York Daily News went on worrying about whether elections would be held and said that we must " fight for America first for a change . .. . If the Philip ? pines , Hong Kong , Singapore and Dutch East Indies can cash in on our defense of ourselves , fine ; but if they can not ? well , our first duty is to ourselves . " The oceans on the big globe on the first floor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Colonel Patterson 's editorial rooms . But The News withdrew an anti-war cartoon , in its later editions . The Chicago Tribune said : " Recriminations are useless . .. all of us , from this day forth , have but one task . " Westbrook Pegler chewed nails and wrote : " In a brawl with Adolf Hitler who is , after all , the principal enemy , it is well to have a man in the White House who will not bother to break clean or keep his punches up . " Dorothy Thompson kept her eye on the ball : " The only logical answer to Japan 's declaration of war against us is to reply with a declaration of war against the Axis . . . . As sure as God made little green apples , Germany is going to declare war on us when it pleases her to do so . " The fact of the week was that the diverse American people , who form a democracy , had become a united people . There had been no coercion .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
