Jut-jawed Manager Joe McCarthy of the New York Yankees , who seldom uses superlatives , wagged his head and said : " He made Dick Merriwell look like a bum . " <P> The man he was talking about was Bob Feller . The Cleveland Indians ' pride &; joy had just pitched a no-hitter that was a prime cut above the average no-hitter . This time luck had practically nothing to do with it ; the 27-year-old Iowa strong-boy had just.rared back and blown down the Yankees , baseball 's most fearsome array of sluggers . The victory tasted doubly sweet after two recent defeats and press-coop barbs that Feller 's $45,000-a-year right arm was losing its sting . <P> Before the game , deadpanned Robert William Andrew Feller , six pounds underweight at 183 , went through his usual routine . He hunted up a razor-blade and shaved down the hard calluses on his right thumb and ring-finger . He picked up a baseball to see if it felt light and small ( a good omen ) or heavy like a pumpkin ( a bad omen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feller was finally ready for the first pitch . His arms heaved from below his knees to a great overhead stretch , his left leg twisted up &; around , he practically put his gloved hand in the batter 's face , his right arm snapped through with as much wrist English as though he were cracking a blacksnake whip . The Yankee lead-off man hardly saw the first one that buzzed by with a full two-inch hop on it . <P> Exactly 132 pitches later , rapid Robert Feller had walked five men , fanned eleven , and given up nothing more substantial than two lazy outfield flies . For this great performance , he rated about 75% of the credit . The other 25% went to lean-jawed , iron-man Catcher Frank Hayes , who outguessed the Yankee hitters all afternoon . When they expected the fast one , Hayes signaled for Feller 's equally effective curve , or his new slider ( a pitch that begins fading away from a right-handed hitter halfway down the alley ) . Said Feller : " I did n't shake off his signals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who guessed Yankee pitching as well as Yankee batting , won the game , 1-0.
