txt The stoppage of coal mining , which has been in effect in ? the bituminous fields since March 15 and which on Monday spread to the anthracite mines , had reached the point by , yesterday where the critical necessity of a break in the deadlock between miners and operators was dictated both by legal and economic considerations . It was difficult to see how John L. Lewis and his miners could hope to continue for more than a few more hours at most to ignore with impunity the order of the Washington District Court to resume work and to enter into collective bargaining with the mine owners . Late in the afternoon some hope appeared that the beginning of that break might - be in sight . Although he failed to put in an appearance or to vouchsafe reply to an invitation of the operators to meet with them yesterday , the head of the coal miners condescended , as evening was approaching , to send a conditional acceptance to a meeting this afternoon . The conditions were rejected . But it remains to be seen whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skies in this longdragged-out dispute , or whether it is merely a fleeting rift in the clouds . One thing is clear , whether the real break is to come from the participants in the controversy , from the Government or from the courts , matters can not be permitted to drift as they have been drifting much longer , for the strain on the national economy is daily becoming more and more serious . Secretary Krug has estimated that on the basis of known inventories and normal consumption a thirty-day strike would curtail or shut down 36 per cent of the nation 's power plants , 56 per cent of the by-product coke plants , 56 per cent of steel and rolling mills , 69 per cent of the operations of the Class I railroads , 36 per cent of the cement mills and 43 per cent of other industries . Meantime the acting head of the Commerce Department reports that steel production , which had been running at 93 per cent of capacity prior to the stoppage , will be down to around 72 per cent this week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that further curtailment of service is already being considered . " Should the stoppage continue for another ten days ( which would be another week , as of today ) it will be necessary , in the interest of conserving the dwindling coal supply , to embargo all freight on railroads except commodities essential to the public health and safety * * * " Thus far we have referred only to the potential danger that the continued cessation of coal mining holds for the normal health and welfare of the community . But no one needs to he told at this day and hour that these are not normal times  --  that if the United States is to fulfill its pledges and its responsibilities toward the democratic , peaceseeking nations of the world it must gear its economic activity to the requirements , not of one , but of three fronts . In addition to meeting an abnormally high domestic demand for goods and services , it must translate into concrete , physical terms its commitments under the Marshall Plan , and at the same time furnish the materials vitally needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconceivable that a nation which has demonstrated its farsightedness , its generosity , and its innate sense of world responsibility by ' setting up the machinery and providing the vast sums required under the European Relief Program will sit quietly by and see this monumental effort undermined by the irresponsible behavior of one labor leader .
