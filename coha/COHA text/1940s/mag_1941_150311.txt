Last week the Army waved aside a rule of more than 100 years ' standing and announced that henceforth ex-felons could wear the Army uniform . But not all ex-felons . Still barred were men convicted of " heinous " offenses . To the Army heinous offenses meant treason , murder , arson , rape , kidnapping , sodomy , pandering , sexual perversion , traffic in narcotics . Also barred were men twice convicted of felony , or thrice of misdemeanors having to do with alcoholism or drug addiction . <P> Why the Army decided to change its rule , no Army man specifically said . At any rate , the Army could now expect some more recruits .
