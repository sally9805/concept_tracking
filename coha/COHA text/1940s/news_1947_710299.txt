txt House and Senate Republican leaders disagreed today over the effect in lost revenues of a personal income tax cut retroactive to Jan. 1 . This question has considerable bearing on prospects of a Senate drive to change the effective date to July 1 . As the House moved toward passage tomorrow of his tax reduction bill , Chairman Harold Knutson of the Ways and Means Committee said that Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio was " confused " in stating that because of the retroactive feature revenue losses in the 1948 fiscal year would exceed House estimates by $1,900,000,000 . Mr. Knutson admitted , however , that the reduction in tax receipts during the year , which begins July 1 , would amount to $326,000,000 more than the $3,836,000,000 estimated in committee 's report to the House . He said that the committee 's figure merely showed how much the taxpayers ' total bill would be reduced in the twelve-month period while the new estimate of actual revenue losses took into account additional payments the Treasury would have to make during the year to refund overpayments made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's assertion that in the final analysis the bill 's retroactive provision would cost an additional $1,900 , - 000,000 in revenue losses . But he calculated that only part of the loss would be reflected in the 1948 fiscal year . The rest , according to his appraisal , would be divided between the fiscal years 1947 and 1949 in consequence of revised tax estimates to be made by taxpayers in the current fiscal year and a lag in other collections and refunds which would carry over into 1949 . The important question to many Republican members of Congress , however , is the tax bill 's effect on revenues in the 1948 fiscal year , since this is the year in which the party hopes to balance the budget and make a substantial payment on the national debt . Their program for accomplishment of these aims was predicated on estimates that tax reduction would cut anticipated revenues by $3,500,000,000 . The figure now has been raised to $4,162,000,000 at the least . Senate opponents of a retroactive tax cut were expected to capitalize on that point in seeking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mr. Taft , who is chairman of the Senate Republican policy committee . Mr. Taft declined to comment today on Mr. Knutson 's statement , but he said that he believed the bill was a good one except for its retroactive feature . He seemed confident the Senate would pass it without other substantial changes . House Passage Expected Democrats fought a losing battle against the measure during the first of two days ' debate in the House , and leaders of both parties predicted passage tomorrow . The House bound itself to make no changes in the bill by adopting with little controversy a Rules Committee recommendation to prohibit any amendments from the floor . Consequently , the bill must be passed , sent back to the Ways and Means Committee or defeated . Democrats generally admitted privately the futility of opposition , and their position was stated frankly to the House by Representative Adolph J. Sabath of Illinois , former chairman of the Rules Committee . " I realize that you will pass this bill , " he said , pointing to the Republican side of the chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you have the majority and can do it . But you will regret it . The American people will realize that you should have dealt more fairly with the low-income groups . " The House prepared for a final vote tomorrow with Republicans almost solidly behind the bill , which gives relief to all taxpayers . Persons with net taxable income of $1,000 or less a year ( after deductions and exemptions ) would receive a 30 per cent cut and most others would get a 20 per cent reduction . The opposition , led by Representative Robert L. Doughton , Democrat , of North Carolina , was based largely on the argument that enactment might preclude any payment of the $260,000,000 national debt . " To date , " Mr. Doughton said , " hopes of a balanced Federal budget still are but hopes . Only when payments are made on the debt from the proceeds of taxation will we be able to feel that the nation actually is on its way out of the fiscal wilderness into which the war plunged us . " He asserted that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requested by President Truman in his budget message would be exceeded when all appropriations bills for the 1948 fiscal year were passed . He called attention specifically to requirements of $400,000,000 for aid to Greece and Turkey , other foreign expenditures ' that may become necessary and about $300 , - 000,000 in benefits to agriculture now being considered . These were not included in the Truman budget . The opponents argued also that the bill gave a disproportionate amount of reductions to wealthy taxpayers . " Under the guise of tax reduction it was intended as a windfall for the rich and a handout for the poor , " said Representative Walter . Lynch , Democrat , of New York . Mr. Knutson and other . Republicans emphasized the need for giving middle and high income groups relief to stimulate enterprise and free venture capital for investment , thus maintaining prosperity . " It is a fair bill , " Mr. Knutson said , " because it puts the axe to punitive taxes designed by alien minds and whizzed through subservient Congresses  --  a tax program that fitted neatly into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Americans and make of this a nation of automatons . " Representative Robert W. Kean , Republican , of New Jersey , accused the Democrats of using " trick figures " in attempting to show that lower-bracket taxpayers would receive smaller reductions than others . " When a man 's taxes are already very small , " he said , " a decrease in taxes can have only a small effect on his . spendable income . "
