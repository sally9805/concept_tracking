Singapore and the English Channel THERE is a great deal of loose and oversimpli ? fied talk in this country about sending all or part of the American fleet to Singapore , and it is advisable for the American people to keep their heads . Presumably the object of sending the ships would be to deter Japan from attempting to occupy the Dutch East Indies and Singapore . That this is a desirable object is self-evident . If it could be attained by just sending ships to the East , so much the better . Japan may indeed be bluffing , as is so widely assumed ; but by poker definition only Japan knows that , and the Only way for America to find out is to call her bluff . In other words , the final decision on whether Ameri ? can ships would have to fight on the way out to Singa ? pore would be Japan 's , not America 's . That being so , it is better for America to remember that priority mat ? ters in politics as well as in arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sound . All American action everywhere must be governed by the fact that there is a European war in progress . That war is incomparably more important to America than the Far Eastern war , and therefore all American action in the Pacific must be conditioned by the neces ? sity of avoiding a war in the Pacific . This imposes no irremediable handicap , since as a matter of fact it is possible for America to accomplish its aims in the Pacific more effectively by acting in the Atlantic . In plain words , it is better to keep the ships at Hawaii and do more to help England . Then the question of sending ships to Singapore may never arise . It is hardly necessary to argue the wisdom of avoid . ing a war with Japan now . The fact that the fascists want such a war is fairly condusive evidence . Further ? more , it is a fact that there has been more talk in this country about sending American ships to help Great Britain in Singapore than there has been in Great Britain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . America might win such a war and win it quickly . But the risk is out of all proportion to the gain . If Japan took up the challenge and America , in the decisive naval engagement , destroyed the Japanese fleet , it would not serve to keep Japan out of the Netherlands Indies and Singapore unless Great Britain won in Europe . If Germany won , America would of course have to recall its fleet to the Atlantic . If America were to lose the decisive naval engagement ? and it must be remembered that the American fleet would go into action against the handicap of fighting thousands of miles from its base ? then quite literally the Ameri ? can continent would be at the mercy of any powerful opponent on either ocean . And if the Germans should win in Europe , the most melodramatic imaginings of those who now seem hysterical might become real . Even if there is only one chance in four of such an eventuality , the risk is not warranted , principally be cause it- is not called for . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Temporary possession of territories there by the Axis is disagreeable but not serious . Permanent possession will be determined in Europe and not in the waters that wash the Malay Peninsula . The outcome in Europe will decide posses ? sion of the Dutch East Indies and Singapore , rather than the reverse . It is the outcome in Europe that must be kept in mind . There are only two reasons for American concern over the South Pacific . The first is that there Japan might strike a blow that would paralyze Great Britain . The second is that by taking Indo-China , the Dutch East Indies and Singapore , Japan would begin the formation of a great Pacific and Asiatic Empire that could jeopardize the whole of the Pacific area and com ? pel the United States to maintain a huge navy and eventually go to war . Incidentally , Japan would thus be able to interrupt America 's supply of rubber and tin . The first reason is not very solid . Great Britain can not be paralyzed in the South Pacific . Her fate is being determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to have saved her Singapore base if she herself had succumbed to Germany . If Great Britain does not come through , possession of Singapore will hardly help her . She will not keep Singapore , or any other colony . If she does come through , she will get it back . If she has to make efforts to do so , we can then properly con ? sider how much help we wish to contribute . And we can contribute help then at a minimum of risk . From the point of view of saving England ? either because of fear of fascism as the principle of world organization or because a bloc of fascist empires would be deemed a menace to American security ? it would serve little purpose for America to deploy its strength thousands of miles from the main battlefront . England can be saved in Europe alone , where her real danger lies . There , too , lies the threat of fascism as the prin ? ciple of world organization . Germany , not Japan , is the source of both threats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . Or , at least , it can be dealt with relatively easily . The second reason has more substance . Japan must indeed be restrained if there is to be peace and security in the Pacific . There can be no stability if Japan is on the march . There can be no stability if she can take and keep sovereignty over the territories of the South Pacific and begin making her way along the southern coast of Asia to the borders of India . The point is that Japan can be most effectively and easily restrained , not in the South Pacific but in the Atlantic , not by sending 828 a navy to Singapore but by giving to England air ? planes , munitions , ships for convoy , credit and what ? ever else is required for use against Germany . All possible pressure should be levied against Japan . Whatever diplomatic , political or economic devices can work to frighten off the Japanese , or penalize them , should be put to use . But if America is forced to a decision ? that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be better to let them go , for the present , and concentrate on Europe . That means not only to con ? tinue help for England on the present scale but to double it , expedite it and , as a matter of national self-interest , make it the first charge on the nation 's economy . This will be less costly than a war in the Pacific , now or eventually , and it will be equally effective . It may even be more effective . If the Germans should be defeated and the British navy could leave European waters with immunity , Japan 's days in Singa ? pore would be numbered . The British Grand Fleet could move toward Singapore from its home waters and the American Battle Fleet could start west from Hawaii . If the Japanese fleet were massed at Singapore , it could be cut off from its home ports , which would be at the mercy of the American fleet . If it came out to fight , it would face a superiority of three to one . Meanwhile Japan could be cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ships at Panama , Suez and Hawaii would sever her world trade and shut off all supplies except such as could be obtained from the neighboring continent , and these would not suffice . Japan would either be under siege , her naval arm pinioned at Singapore , or she would have to fight un ? der conditions that would spell defeat . For Great Britain and America it would be a simple and easy war , and its results would be decisive for decades . In fact , thus might be offered an opportunity of laying , easily and quickly , once and for all , the spectre of a war or series of wars in the Far East . If Japanese aggression were once stayed and China assured of independence ( as she would be if Japan were effectively suppressed ) , then the forces that make for war in the Pacific would be nullified , at least for the present . From this point of view , in fact , it would not be particularly , unfortunate if Japan did set out on an adventure toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she can not be reached . She can mass her power around her islands and invite others to come at their peril . She can fight in her home waters and thus fight with tremendous , if not decisive , advantage against any enemy which has not an enormous supe ? riority in ships ? something no other nation now has . This asset Japan loses if she stretches her naval line more than 1,500 miles to Singapore . Then she must guard and supply bases in the Dutch Indies and Singa ? pore , keep communications open and fight far from her home bases and sources of supply . Under such circum THE NEW REPUBLIC stances she would suffer from the same disabilities that now operate against Western countries in the East . Japan 's land lines are already dangerously attenu ? ated in China . In fact , so large a part of the army is now drawn out on the continent that sectors of China have had to be evacuated to organize the expeditionary force presumably intended for the southward advance . Supplying the army in China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already put the country on short rations . The consumption of materials and capital has gravely depleted the country . Japan 's condition may not yet be desperate ; but it is perilous . To take the Dutch East Indies and Singapore would entail heavy losses ? probably in ships and men , cer ? tainly in materials . Both garrisoning and provisioning would put a strain on the country that would drain its vitality farther and faster . The war in China is not over . There is no prospect of Japan 's being able to reduce her commitments there . There is less prospect of peace by compromise now than there was in the past . There is still no basis for com ? promise . The kind of peace that Japan would be wil to offer , China will not accept , since it would be tantamount to accepting the status of a Japanese pro ? tectorate . The kind of peace that China would agree to , Japan can not offer , since it would be tantamount to acknowledging defeat and thus inviting a terrible reck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargain depriving China of Russian supplies and cutting'up Eastern Asia into spheres would not necessarily bring China to her knees . China 's dependence on external sources of supply for defensive war has been exagger ated . It is great , but not vital . Furthermore , while a Japanese-Russian treaty is not unlikely , an agreement that both would live up to is more than unlikely . It is to Russia 's interest that Japan slowly bleed to death . Russia is hardly likely to stanch the flow . She may sign a diplomatic document agreeing to stop helping China ) but she will continue to help , regardless of her sig ? nature . The war in China will go on , and it is to America 's interest to provide enough help to China to make that war as costly to Japan as possible . America should deny as much war material to Japan as she can . She should give further credits to China and shipping to trans ? port supplies bought with those credits to Rangon7 for shipment over the Burma Road . China should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only because a strong and independent China is a guarantee of peace in the Far East but because thus the whole Japanese menace can be laid . It is not enough to prevent Japan from extending her sway southward . It is necessary also to prevent her from establishing a continental empire . Disputed dominion over China is as certain to produce chronic wars as disputed control over South Pacific colonies rich in raw materials . In DE CE M BE R 16 , 1940 fact , China still is the crux of the Far . Eastern conflict . The whole Singapore-Dutch Indies question is only a complication , induced by the European war . If , however , China continues resistance on the pres ? ent scale and , in addition , Japan extends her lines 1,500 miles or more to the southward , then ? after having had to fight two land and sea engagements ? Japan will be attenuated to such a degree that under pressure applied at the right points , she will snap all the more easily . That Japan will have to be dealt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she should be dealt with by changes from within . That is to say , the Japanese people should dispossess the military caste of power and put a stop to megalomaniac adven ? turings . But such action is now more remote than ever , for the military caste has , for all practical purposes , dictatorial power . The next best solution would be for Internal economic exhaustion to bring Japan to invol ? untary retreat and probably , in consequence , cause the overthrow of the military caste . This may come about . But if Japan succeeded in extending her sway through 829 the accident of the European war and thus replenished her strength , a situation would arise that would force other nations to fight America in particular . Japan has to be dealt with , and probably she can be dealt with more easily if she overextends herself by going as far as Singapore . This , of course , is contingent on Great Britain 's coming through . The crux , that is to say , is British survival in Europe . Everything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefrom . Whatever Japan does now in the South Pacific should be put in the category of unfinished business . For America there is only one sensible course . Concentrate on Europe . Give all help to England . Bring England through . Then the Far East will take care of itself or be taken care of with ease and dispatch . And thus , incidentally , the door will be closed to what might in time come to be America 's own imperialistic adventurings in the East ? undertaken originally for legitimate defensive pur ? poses and maintained for the wealth and power they yielded .
