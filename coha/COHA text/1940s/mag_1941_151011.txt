Ickes Avenue <P> Sirs : <P> Your article in TIME , Sept. 15 , on Secretary Ickes proved very interesting but did not do him justice . Enclosed is a picture of a street named in the Secretary 's honor see cut . The scene is Mason City , Wash. , a small town which grew out of the Grand Coulee Dam . In the picture you may notice only back doors opening onto Ickes Avenue . This is also true of all the houses on this street . <P> Mason City will soon be a ghost town and Ickes Avenue a ghost street . <P> WILLIAM F. EGELHOFF Cambridge , Mass . <P> Junior 's Bib <P> Sirs : <P> . . . About Mr. Lindbergh one thing has always puzzled me . . . . What has this mechanic and aviator ( and a damned good one ) ever done that makes him think he is a guiding light for mankind ? Is n't this what the psychiatrists call a form of megalomania ? It 's presumptuousness at the least . Now that he has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be merely ridiculous-he becomes a menace to the very ideals of tolerance and justice which we are trying to strengthen and deepen . If we must have Junior in politics let him keep his bib clean . <P> HARRY SUYDAM Northville , Mich . <P> Sirs : <P> In your screwy attack on Charles Lindbergh ( TIME , Sept. 22 ) for classing Jews with British and the Roosevelt Administration as those crowding the nation into war , and charging " the ex-hero 's appeal to prejudice and bigotry , " you misrepresent him and the whole movement for a Constitutional war or none . I have read every issue of TIME and have found it usually fair . But this is so unfair and foul it stinks . <P> HIRAM B. HARRISON San Antonio , Tex . <P> Sirs : <P> Ex-hero is right ! TIME certainly gives Charles A. Lindbergh his proper title in your issue of Sept. 22 . ... <P> For a national hero that Des Moines outburst now makes him a national " dud " and probably the most unpopular national figure in America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as quickly as it takes to pack up and go home . <P> FRANK W. HICKS Gillette , Wyo . <P> Sirs : <P> The New York Herald Tribune quoted by TIME is all wrong . Lindbergh did not " whistle up Old World racial hatreds here . " He merely called attention to the fact that Old World hatreds and rivalries have been , and are being , used here by the forces that control the means of propaganda . The three groups he named are trying , for their own selfish interests , to get this country into the war . It is they who " whistle up the hatreds . " <P> NOEL A. DUNDERDALE Chicago , Ill . <P> Sirs : <P> As a lifelong pacifist , of American birth , may I state that all true Americans must deprecate the testimony , argument and speeches . . . bringing racial questions into the discussion of war or peace , whatever the motives of those who raise the issue . <P> The myth of Jewish solidarity is as fantastic as the myth of Catholic solidarity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided on purely racial or religious lines . But American solidarity today is being undermined by exciting such myths on such a bitterly discussed question .
