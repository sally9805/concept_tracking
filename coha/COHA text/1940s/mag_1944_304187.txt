If you have lost a hand , an ear or the side of your face in battle or in an accident , a Detroit sculptor named Beaver Edwards can make you a duplicate , in three weeks , so lifelike that only close observers can tell the difference . Like Hollywood 's Jack Dawn ( TIME , July 12 ) , Beaver Edwards makes his realistic faces and ears of a rubbery plastic . Jack Dawn learned his methods as a Hollywood make-up chief . Beaver Edwards developed his by teaching sculpture at the Michigan College of Mortuary Science . <P> Sculptor Edwards ' specialty is hands . He can take an impression of a man 's good left hand , make him a right-hand copy of it so realistic that even the fine skin lines show . The hand will hold a pencil or cigaret ( see cut ) , and the fingers bend naturally if leaned against something solid . The coloring is lifelike ( if it wears off , it can be touched up temporarily with leg make-up ) . An Edwards hand and arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard mechanical hands are lifesize , and when covered with Edwards ' special plastic would look monstrous . Last week Edwards was planning to make an articulated plastic hand by using a smaller than life-size mechanical model . <P> Sculptor Edwards says he does ten times as much business as anyone else in lifelike anatomical restorations . War is booming his business so heavily that he gets a new order every day , works seven days a week , has practically abandoned sculpturing .
