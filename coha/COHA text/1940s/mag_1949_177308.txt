It was high time , thought State Representative Floyd L. Snyder , that the Missouri Waltz be established as Missouri 's official state song . He introduced a bill to make it so . Then , to be sure all his fellow legislators could hum what they were voting for , he invited the orchestra of Missouri 's Lincoln University ( for Negroes ) to swing through it for them . There was only one thing Snyder forgot : the lyrics . <P> From the university 's music-department head , O. Anderson Fuller , came a brisk reminder : " In this song you will find such words as ' mammy ' , ' pickaninny ' and ' darkies ' , which render any song unfit and unworthy of such a high honor . " Lincoln 's orchestra , he wrote , would have to decline the invitation to play it . <P> Replied Snyder : " My interest in the song comes not from the text but from the melody . " The Kansas City Star picked up the same tune in an editorial : " Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be expected to remember them anyway . " Last week , Missouri 's lower house apparently agreed , approved Snyder 's bill , 91 to 31.
