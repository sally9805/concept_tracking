txt Cambrai here two words were censored was ferociously bombed twice just after 9 o'clock yesterday morning . It was full of refugees , and when I left the town two hours later by bicycle , because no other means of transportation was available , heavy smoke clouds rose from four words censored building , and a few miles away Douai , Arras and Peronne presented the same spectacle . Fourteen words censored Its psychological objectives apparently are to terrify everybody into running away and submission . The value of the former depends on the ability of the Germans to hold the mastery of the air and prevent quick repair work from being done where it is essential . About the effect of these bombing raids on the nerves , no soldier or civilian who has suffered one has any doubt . They are hellish . Every soldier agrees that shelling and machine-gunning , as they were done in the last war , had nothing of the terror of these 300-mile-anhour dives to a height of about 200 feet and the scream and pound , pound , pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little automatic switch . Bombers Fascinate Watcher When these raids happen somewhere else , but within sight , they leave the observer with a curious sense of abstract interest . On Thursday evening we stood in the one word censored square in front of the hotel and saw twenty-four German bombers float overhead in good formation without any hurry . Twenty-nine words censored . In the evening sky they drifted lazily across , and as soon as they were safely away everybody watched them interestedly . Then , while they // NAZI DIVE BOMBERS TERRIFY REFUGEES // were still in sight , came thud , thud , thud in such rapid succession as to be almost continuous . The attack was undoubtedly being made on a column two words censored . In these cases , it had been explained to us the day before , discipline counts tremendously .

If they are caught in the open the casualties are very heavy , but the French claim that during the advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was such an impressive thing from the far-away onlookers ' viewpoint that the reality of its nearness did not touch the inhabitants . For days before they had been busy receiving and - eding on their way Belgian refugees . Raid Leaves Uneasiness There were sometimes air-raid alarms , but no bombs had been dropped on Cambrai itself . Like Nancy , just a week earlier , it seemed to be leading a charmed life , protected perhaps by its guardian angel , Louis Bleriot , the first man to fly the English Channel , who was born there . After that raid on Thursday , however , there was some uneasiness . How it reached the people it is difficult to say , except that it was produced by the spectacle of the indifference of these twenty-four raiding Germans five lines censored . By Thursday evening the four remaining newspapermen , two French journalists , H. Taylor Henry of The Associated Press and myself , decided that we were , by the fact that our escort and guide one word censored had left without saying good-bye twenty-two words censored . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any kind and decided to do on Friday whatever seemed advisable as to going to meet the battle or let it come to us . When we saw the colonel commanding the local garrison that evening he recommended that we leave in the morning , as there were no more trains that night . The others felt they would like to stay in the district . I decided to return to Paris . So yesterday near 7 o'clock I went to the station to take a train that was scheduled to leave near 6 . Curiously , it had left at 6:40 , so I left my baggage and decided to take the next train , about 10 . At breakfast Mr. Henry and I discussed the situation and decided again to see the Colonel . As we walked down to the barracks I noticed a bicycle shop and , having had urgent need to steal a bicycle to get away from the advancing Germans in the last war , I recommended that we might take an option on a couple before seeing the Colonel , business being evidently brisk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grips Residents The atmosphere had suddenly become strained . At the barracks we found that not only had the colonel gone but that all the archives were being packed and taken away . Twenty words censored . Anyhow , it seemed a safe thing to buy those bicycles because whatever trains might be running would be so crowded that to ride on them would be worse than pedaling fifty or sixty miles . There were some delays over the transaction and it was just after 9 when we left the shop for the station and the hotel , where we were to collect what baggage we could carry . I suggested as we turned into the station square that we turn left and leave our newly acquired steeds at the hotel garage while we collected our things . As we swung into the square we suddenly heard them coming . It gives the impression of sixty express trains all soaring at once . ' The air is filled with commotion , fury and dread . They had probably sailed in high up and then dropped into that terrific dive , quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in for it and dashed around the corner on our bicycles as the first whistling noise of the falling bombs shrilled out above the roar of the engines . The air was rent not only by the noise but by everything that was flying around and behind us . It was filled , too , with a nasty bitter smell of smoke . Seeing the planes rise over our heads . we dashed dowy. the street for proper shelter behind sandbags because we were certain they would come back again and they did , but only roaring up again into the sun without dropping anything . Mr. Henry started off to cycle up the street to the hotel . I was engaged with a little boy calling pitifully , " Mama , mama . " When I had found the boy 's father I could still see Mr. Henry ahead and started pedaling along to overtake him , rather interested in an exercise I have taken little for more than thirty years . Just as the railroad station came into view , that terrific rush began again . The plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if there should be no bombs . I and my bicycle spreadeagled on the sidewalk behind the corner of a house . Mr. Henry , farther up the street , had the back of his bicycle wheel bent and burst by a bomb splinter , surely the first war correspondent to have a new bicycle disabled under him . It seemed in its way all good fun to get up again and dust one 's pants and feel , " Well , that 's that . " But I went straight to the station building . In the last war it was damaged but never destroyed . Eighteen words censored . Inside the hall lay at least a dozen bodies of innocent refugees of all ages . One word censored a woman three words censored was sitting five words censored calling pitifully for help , her face streaming with blood . Three words censored . Where the first lot of bombs had fallen , the dead were even more numerous . Six words censored . After doing what I could , I rejected the idea of searching for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . On our bicycles we started out for what was to be a seventy-five mile ride along with an enormous exodus of people , and some of them the finest people in France , the farming people of the Somme Department , with their grand horses and great wagons . As we entered one village the town crier was giving the news . By order of the prefect the Mayor was announcing that everybody must leave in an hour . ' What am I to do ? " one fine-looking woman exclaimed . " My husband is mobilized , I have three children , six horses , thirty-two cows and nobody but myself to care for them or drive them on the road . " Throughout the afternoon and the night and this morning this endless procession of farming people leaving their rich farms was moving westward . It was pitiful and heartrending , but supposedly it is the only thing to do against an enemy whose airmen bomb as they bombed Poland .                 @ @ @ @
