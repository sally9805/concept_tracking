While the presidential campaign purred smoothly along , some of the local races were hotting up . Last week 's hottest : <P> Connecticut . In a Republican year in a normally Republican state , a Republican governor should have little trouble getting reelected . The news from Connecticut was that Governor James C. Shannon , who succeeded to the office last March on the death of Governor James L. McConaughy , was getting a run for his money . The man who was doing it was ex-OPAdministrator Chester Bowles , who was crisscrossing the state , dropping in at the county fairs ( sometimes joining in the softball games ) , and appearing three times a week on a radio program on which he invited voters to send him all their personal complaints . He hammered away at inflation , proposed a " voluntary " price-control plan . Governor Shannon still figured to win . Chester Bowles 's ambition was to pile up a vote impressive enough to give him a share in taking over the receivership of the Democratic Party . <P> Illinois . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily defeat the Democrats ' leftish Paul Douglas , who ignored the party regulars , doggedly waged a futile one-man campaign from his station-wagon jeep . But the Republicans ' handsome playboy , Governor Dwight Green , was facing real opposition from political amateur Adlai Stevenson ( TIME , March 8 ) . Backed by the nominally independent ( but actually pro-Republican ) Chicago Daily News , with the full support of other papers as far away as the St. Louis Post-Dispatch , Candidate Stevenson was hitting hard at graft , shakedowns and kickbacks in the state administration . Cried the News : " The Green administration . . . nourishes a swarm of grafters , chiselers and racketeers who grow bolder every year . " Even if Pete Green rode into a third term on the Republican tide , socialite Lawyer-Diplomat Stevenson was learning some lessons for the future in the rough &; tumble of Illinois politics . Said Stevenson : " If it 's true that politics is the art of compromise , I 've had a good start ; my mother was a Republican and a Unitarian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended up in his party and her church . " <P> Ohio . If popular ex-Governor Frank Lausche returns to the Executive Mansion , Republican Governor Tom Herbert will have only himself to blame . Practical John Bricker had been shrewd enough to separate the state and national ballots when he was running for governor in 1940 , thus avoiding burial in the Roosevelt landslide . But bumbling Tom Herbert had refused to ask the legislature to unite them again last summer to take advantage of Tom Dewey 's pulling power . Plainly bored by Herbert 's long-winded campaigning , many a Republican was listening to the impromptu , Lincoln-quoting speeches of Democrat Lausche , who had whipped the whole state machine to win the nomination , now was playing a lone hand with little mention of the rest of his ticket . His chances on Election day depended on the strength of an increasingly common curbstone comment : " I vote Republican but I 'm going to cut over for Lausche. "                   @ @
