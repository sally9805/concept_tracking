ROBERT Louis STEVENSON ( 196 pp. ) - David Daiches-New Directions ( $2 ) . <P> I remember him as if it were yesterday , as he came plodding to the inn door , his sea-chest following behind him in a handbarrow ; a tall , strong , heavy , nut-brown man ; his tarry pigtail jailing over the shoulders of his soiled blue coat ; his hands ragged and scarred , with black , broken nails ; and the saber cut across one cheek , a dirty , livid white . I remember him looking round the cove and whistling to himself as he did so , and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so often afterwards : <P> Fifteen men on the dead man 's chest- Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum ! <P> in the high , old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and broken at the capstan bars . . . . <P> Robert Louis Stevenson 's Treasure Island , which was first published in book form in 1883 , is one of the western world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice of literary criticism has either ignored it or rated it as the literary equivalent of scooters and bubble gum . Now , Cornell Lecturer David Daiches ( Poetry in the Modern World , The Novel in the Modern World ) , like Stevenson an Edinburgh expatriate , has made an attempt to increase his countryman 's stature with a careful , interesting , but rather timid analysis of Stevenson 's works . <P> Emigrants &; Strangers . Roaming through the streets of Edinburgh , the hills of Pentland , the romantic Highlands , Novelist Stevenson and Critic Daiches are as happy together as two old emigrants swapping reminiscences of the old country . But in most other matters they are temperamentally total strangers . Studious Critic Daiches is chiefly interested in showing that if Stevenson had not been cut off in his prime , he would have parked his little scooter and become as profound and dignified as Sophocles and Shakespeare . Romantic Novelist Stevenson ( a tubercular who was to die in Samoa at 43 ) was chiefly interested in enjoying the lively , glamorous places to which his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporaries , Stevenson did his utmost to escape from ordinary , everyday life . But he was too little of an esthete to flee into the world of art-for-art's-sake , too much of a romantic to want the grim , bare world of the French realists-a world whose fiction he described , in a rare burst of savagery , as " that meat-market of middle-aged sensuality . " After a spell of youthful Bohemianism , Stevenson dropped anchor in his own fair harbor-the world of Treasure Island , Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde , The New Arabian Nights . <P> <P> Unrealistic Realists . It was an escape of which he was not in the least ashamed . " There is an idea abroad among moral people , " he wrote , " that they should make their neighbors good . One person I have to make good : myself . But my duty to my neighbor is much more nearly expressed by saying that I have to make him happy-if I may . "                 @ @ @ @
