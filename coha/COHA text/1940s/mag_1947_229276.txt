Pablo Picasso was a changed man once again . A change of scene had done it . He had left Paris last summer to roam the warm Cote d'Azur . At Antibes the 17th Century Castle Grimaldi , which had been turned into a museum , caught his eye . The curator happened to be a friend of his and told 65-year-old Picasso to make himself at home . <P> In a holiday mood , Picasso swept his new quarters free of archaic coins and archeological treasures , painted the walls bright green to soften the Riviera sunlight , locked himself in with an armload of paints and brushes , and started to work . For eight hours a day , for almost four months , he worked . <P> Only the seagulls , swooping and screaming in the blue rectangles beyond Picasso 's green studio , could glimpse what he was up to . When museum visitors paused to inquire why a first floor door was barred , the guide sympathetically explained : " There 's a crazy artist inside ; nobody can enter . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found ( and reported in last week 's Parisian Arts magazine ) was almost enough to ring the bells in art-conscious Paris . His discovery : the past-master of distortion and despair in oils had been painting like a happy man once more . <P> Infernal Cycle Closed . Picasso , said Art Critic Rene Rennes , is " working on some very large paintings . . . and it must be said that the spirit of these works constitutes a new phase in the history of Picasso . Ever since the disgust and indignation expressed in Guernica , his canvases have been more or less in the same idiom-the expression of murder and barbarism , but at Antibes Picasso has closed the infernal cycle of Guernica . Luminous Mediterranean skies replace the black sun of Spain at war . Centaurs play pipes and an inspired woman , a sort of Goddess of Joy , dances in the company of little goats . . . . The message he sends from Antibes is one of hope and grandeur . " <P> Picasso himself was back in Paris last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had locked up his Riviera labors-about 50 pieces , including gouaches and drawings-and left the key with his friend the curator , who hoped that Antibes would make the green museum room a " Picasso Hall . " That was all right with Antibes ' practical-minded Mayor Jean Pastour . " In my mind , " said the Mayor , " Picasso 's paintings are . . . monstrous things . . . . Yet the world is full of madmen who love Picasso , so if Picasso gives our museum some paintings , we will accept and exhibit . Perhaps some crazy fool would come to see them and the town would make money . "
