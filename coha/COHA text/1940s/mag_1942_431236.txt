H ERE is a U. S. Army fighter plane ? the Lockheed P-38 ? which , viewed from a certain angle , looks like three airplanes instead of one , until you see that it consists of a fuselage mounted between two slim engine nacelles and two sets of tail surfaces . Here is another ? the Republic P-47B ? packing about the same weight and wallop as the P-38 , but utterly different in size and contour , with a single engine so large that it dwarfs the rest of the plane . And still others , some of more or less " conventional " design like the Curtiss P-40 's , with the pilot sitting amidships behind the engine , or the engine in back of the pilot as in the Bell P-39C , or with pusher propellers like the Bell YFM . They differ in what can be seen and more in what can not be seen ? in armor , fuel tanks , superchargers , and auxiliary equipment ? and yet every one of them is a U. S. Army fighter and nothing else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flown by the same service , show  | such variations in design ? One reason is that development is proceeding at a very rapid pace , and a lot of good ideas are competing for supremacy . But a more compelling reason is the complexity of the problems which call for solution . After all , to say that a plane is designed to fight is pretty vague . When ? by day or by night ? Where ? at 30,000 feet altitude or 3,000 ? Whom ? is it to attack enemy bombers or protect friendly bombers ? When such questions are asked it becomes evident that the fighter plane must be designed for one or two fairly specialized jobs . When we survey existing models of fighters on this basis , a more or less logical pattern of design and development begins to emerge . There are three principal types of fighters on the basis of range . The interceptor is designed for operations close to its base . The pursuit plane for night fighting and extended day operations requires a considerably longer range , while heavy fighters for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the interceptor . The name indicates what its job is ? to get off the ground on the shortest possible notice , climb with the greatest possible speed , and scare off or shoot down bombers , if possible before they can reach their objective . It is essentially a flying machine-gun nest ? a small , highly maneuverable plane with a big engine . The engine must be big to get the plane up there fast and to give it the advantage over the bomber in speed ? which , nowadays , calls for 400 m.p.h. and up . The interceptor is an inherently limiter : type of plane , capable of carrying only a few guns , no great amount of ammunition only enough gas for a few hundred miles of flight , and one man to do all the work of piloting and shooting . For the interceptor pilot the motto is , If at first you do n't succeed , give up and fly home . He just has n't the ammunition or the fuel to do anything else . And there is no point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the bomber is pretty definitely known . For all these reasons the interceptor is essentially a daylight weapon . But because the interceptor can do deadly work when the conditions are right , bombers fly mainly at night . The night pursuit plane does not need the high maneuverability and top speed of the day interceptor . It is not going to engage in a dogfight . On the other hand , it needs much more gas capacity , for ordinarily it will take some time to find the bomber . For this purpose the night fighter is equipped with some form of long-range detection device . Even after the bomber is located and sighted , considerable stalking time must remain in the gasoline tanks . When the opportunity for the kill finally presents itself , the pursuit plane must close in and do the job quickly .  | Day interceptors are almost always single-engine planes . For a given amount of power a single-engine plane is more maneuverable than a twoengine plane . Night fighters may have one engine or two . The multi-engine fighter may also be advantageously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armament in the form of 20-mm. cannon or larger , and machine guns of .30 and .50 caliber . The crew normally consists of two men . Such planes are suitable for patrol work and long-range hunting , and also for escorting friendly bombers . The design of fighter plane , is conditioned as much by bomber performance as by the characteristics of other fighters . It is the bomber which works destruction on land and sea , and the ultimate function of the fighter is to down bombers . The fighter tackles an enemy fighter to put him out of the way so that he or someone else can get a whack L t a hostile bomber or some similar flying objective . The way in which bomber design affects fighter design is well illustrated by the application of superchargers , first to bombers , then to pursuit planes . A gasoline engine normally loses power as it gets into the rarefied atmosphere of the higher altitudes , where the cylinders gulp in less air for each piston stroke . This loss can be counteracted by increasing the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or by supercharging . The original Boeing Flying Fortress had a top speed of 250 m.p.h. at 13,000  | feet with its four motors wide open . With the same motors supercharged , it is good for more than 300 m.p.h. at 20,000 feet , and it can cruise comfortably at 245 m.p.h. at 30,000 feet . The same thing must be done for fighters intended to operate at high altitudes , but it is harder because of limited space and weight allowances . With the above considerations in mind we can discern the general design pattern of our current Army fighter models . Almost all the types to be described have proved their merits in actual combat . Naturally some are better than others . A few will fall by the wayside , others will undergo further development . Later models will be quite different from their prototypes , and a lot better . Typical of the one-engine , one-seat fighters designed for sea-level operation ? which means between sea level and an altitude of about 20,000 feet ? are planes like the Bell P-39 Airacobra and the Curtiss Hawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,150-h.p. , liquid-cooled Allison motor which drives a three-bladed tractor propeller through a 10-foot extension shaft . Landing gear is of the tricycle type . The armament consists of a 20-mm. cannon in the propeller hub , as well as light and heavy-caliber machine guns . The weight of the plane , loaded , is 7,380 pounds , this includes sufficient ammunition for fairly sustained fire . The range at the most economical cruising speed is 1,100 miles , which is very good . A plane with these characteristics is more than a match for the equivalent Messerschmitt , the Me-109F , and approximately equal to the British Spitfire . But only up to about 16,000 feet . The later Curtiss Hawks are designed for somewhat higher ceilings . The current model stems from the original P-36 , through the P-37 and the more highly streamlined P-40D and E. The earlier P-40 's compared favorably with the older Spitfires and Hurricanes ; the latest type is believed to equal or excel any of the European fighters . Increases in speed and high-altitude performance have been achieved in spite of greatly increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Army fighters specifically designed for high-altitude operations ? between say 16,000 feet and the present effective ceiling of about 35,000 feet ? include the Republic P-43F Lancer and the same company 's P-47B Thunderbolt . The P-43F is powered with a Pratt &; Whitney Twin Wasp 1,200-h.p. air-cooled engine . The loaded weight is slightly less than that of the Airacobra ? 6,900 pounds . Armament consists of large  | and small-caliber machine guns . The companion Republic pursuit plane , the P-47B , is at present the most powerful of American single-engine , single-seater fighters . The motor is a 14-cylinder , 2,000-h.p . Pratt &; Whitney radial , driving a four-blade propeller . High-altitude performance is obtained by means of a turbo-supercharger . This plane is said to have reached a speed of 680 m.p.h. in a power dive . The U. S. Army has two twin-engine fighters for escort service and special missions . One is the Lockheed P-38 Lightning and the other the Bell YFM-1A Airacuda . Both are armed with cannon and machine guns . The P-38 is the faster of the two , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run as high as 3,000 miles . The P-38 carries a crew of one or two , the YFM a crew of five . For high-altitude service these heavy fighters are equipped with turbo-superchargers . Weights of two-engine fighters run around 11,000-14,000 pounds , as compared with 6,000-8,000 pounds for single-engine fighters . The U. S. Navy uses air-cooled engines for its carrier-based fighters . Such planes must be equipped with arresting hooks which engage horizontal cables on the carrier deck to bring the plane to a quick stop in landing . This calls for stronger and heavier undercarriages . The wings of some of the later types fold so that more planes may be accommodated in a given deck space . Gasoline capacity is at least 50 percent higher than in land-based planes of the same type . In spite of these handicaps , naval fighters are nearly as fast as the equivalent Army aircraft and the service ceilings are about the same . Principal naval fighters are the Brewster Buffalo ( F2A ) and Grumman Wildcat ( F4F ) . The latest model of the latter , the F4F-3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pratt &; Whitney air-cooled twin-row engine . Its cruising range is about 1,000 miles . Most efficient operation is at 20,000 feet . Normal armament consists of four .50 caliber machine guns . For light dive-bombing operations two 11-pound bombs may be carried . This plane is said to have been dived at over 500 m.p.h. , but another Navy fighter , the Vought-Sikorsky Corsair , F4U-1 , is even faster . The Navy also has an experimental two-engine fighter , the Grumman Skyrocket ( XF5F-1 ) . It is interesting to compare these American fighter planes with European models . The German Messerschmitt Me-109F is in the same class as our latest P-39 's and P-40 's . It is powered with a 1,150 h.p . Daimler-Benz DB-601N motor , liquid-cooled  | and supercharged for a 40,000-foot service ceiling . The speed is 362 m.p.h. at 13,000 feet , and 380 m.p.h. at 21,000 feet , the latter being the top speed . Range is 370 miles at 307 m.p.h. ( 1.2 hours ) , and 600 miles at 262 m.p.h. ( 2.3 hours ) . The principal novelty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 900 rounds per minute ? just below the normal rate of fire of a modern machine gun . Loaded , the plane weighs 6,000 pounds . It is said to have been especially designed for dogfights and admittedly has a faster climb than the British Spitfire , but the latter has shown better maneuverability in encounters . The British Beaufighter I is a two-engine , two-place fighter adapted from a medium bomber . Each engine is rated at 1,400 h.p . The armament is very heavy ? four fixed cannon in the fuselage and six fixed machine guns in the wings . The maximum speed is fair ? 330 m.p.h. , and the service ceiling is 29,000 feet . The opposing German fighter , the twin-engine Me-110 , has a higher top speed ? 365 m.p.h . Another German twin-engine fighter , the Focke-Wulf FW187 , with about the same maximum speed ( at 20,000 feet ) is said to have a service ceiling of 39,000 feet . Equivalent American two-engine fighters like the Lockheed P-38 are believed to be superior in speed , climb , and hitting power . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , power and altitude performance , maneuverability , fire power , and armor protection . Speed , to prevent the enemy fighter or bomber from escaping by diving or straight flight . Power , to prevent the enemy from escaping by zooming , and maneuverability so that he can not elude his pursuer by a sudden change  | in direction . Fire power is vital so that the enemy may be put out of commission the few seconds of close engagement . Since the enemy has exactly the same purpose , the best possible armor protection must be provided . Almost all the basic factors ? speed , power , altitude performance , weight , etc. are tending to rise . Speeds are or will soon be between 400 and 450 m.p.h. at altitudes between 20,000 and 35,000 feet . This means that the airplane must be as small as possible to reduce drag . Weights , nevertheless , are increasing because of ordnance , armor protection , and engine requirements . Supercharging is essential for efficient operation at high altitudes . Two general types of superchargers are at present availablecentrifugal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which utilize the exhaust gases to drive a turbine wheel which in turn drives the compressor . The geared superchargers are simpler , but they work well only at the middle altitudes . The propeller presents a similar problem . A propeller which may be satisfactory at sea level and under take-off conditions will have entirely unsatisfactory propulsive efficiency at high altitudes and high speeds . A propeller suitable for a medium-powered engine will not work with a larger engine . The propeller tip speed can be increased only to a given point , and of course the diameter is limited by structural considerations . Consequently the tendency is toward a greater number of blades . Modern propellers for high-altitude flight must be equipped with pitch control . Between take-off and terminal-velocity dive the pitch range may have to be as high as 40 degrees . The pilot can not attend to it ; he has too many other things to do . Automatic pitch-control devices are mandatory . Protection and fire power seesaw in the air as in battleship design . Bigger guns call for thicker armor , thicker armor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight and cut down speed . Again the solution is by compromise ? the continued installation of both .30 and .50 caliber machine guns on fighters is one example . At first .30 guns were adequate . Heavier armoring brought .50 guns and cannon . Small cannon are valuable when the pursuit plane tackles a bomber . Aerial engagements with machine guns must be fought at close quarters , usually not exceeding 300 meters . On the other hand , a pursuit plane armed with a cannon can damage a bomber and sometimes bring it down , without coming within the effective fire area of the bomber 's machine guns . Radical developments in future fighter designs are possible , even probable . Perhaps the most rapid progress may be expected in night fighting and in what may be called engineering the pilot for combat at high altitudes . In wartime these and other matters are best left to the imagination . The enemy will find out about them in due course , but he will have to get the information in the air , and , we may hope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
