The four-motored plane from Chungking came down at Moscow 's airport . China 's Premier T. V. Soong was the first to alight . He wore a blue suit , but not his horn-rimmed spectacles . Russia 's Foreign Commissar Viacheslav Molotov greeted him . The foreign colony stood by , including U.S. Ambassador W. Averell Harriman and British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr . A guard of honor snapped to attention . A band played the national anthems of China and Russia . <P> Immediately T. V. plunged into a round of diplomatic activity which might well mark a new era in Chinese-Russian relations . Within his first four days in Moscow , China 's indefatigable Premier saw Generalissimo Stalin twice - with " most gratifying " results , said well-informed sources . He conferred three times with Ambassador Harriman . He was wined &; dined by Molotov . He went to a performance of Tchaikovsky 's Nutcracker Suite . The audience claqued thunderously for his benefit . <P> No communiques were issued , but high diplomatic sources said that T. V. and the Kremlin were discussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern . Speculation ranged over these possibilities : <P> The Chinese and Russians might be negotiating a pact . It might mean Russian military aid for China in its fight against Japan . It might mean economic assistance . <P> In return for such help , Chungking might grant Moscow a warm-water naval base ( presumably Port Arthur ) and railway rights in Manchuria , thus restoring to Soviet Russia the privileges Japan had taken from her in 1905 and 1933 . <P> Moscow might press the Chinese Communists to come to an agreement with the Chungking Government , thus scotching China 's dangerous internal conflict . <P> Moscow might be proposing a territorial deal . In return for concessions in Sinkiang , Inner Mongolia , Manchuria and Korea , the Russians might support a Chinese claim in French Indo-China . <P> Enter a Mongol . On the fifth day of T. V. 's mission another visitor suddenly arrived from the East : Marshal Kharloin Choibalsan , Premier of the Mongolian People 's Republic ( Outer Mongolia ) , the vast , semiarid , herd-rich heartland of Central Asia . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like T. V. , he was greeted by Molotov , a guard of honor and national music . Like T. V. , he conferred with Stalin . <P> No communiqu disclosed the reason for Premier Choibalsan 's appearance . The non-Soviet world knew even less about him than about his Soviet-dominated country . But it knew that he wears the Order of Lenin , for " conspicuous services in organizing material aid to the Red Army in the Mongolian People 's Republic , " and that in any discussion of Chinese-Russian relations , Marshal Choibalsan 's nation will play an important part .
