The most useful activity possible for men and nations in 1948 was the prevention of World War III . Last week the rate of that activity took a spurt . If it could be increased about ten times and maintained at that higher level for about 15 years , the chances of avoiding World War III would be good . <P> World War III would come a lot closer if world Communism grew in power to the point where it felt able to attack the U.S. Since World War II ended , Communism 's power had grown faster than any rise in Hitler 's power between 1933 and 1939 . The Communists were not the X in the equation . Their intention to rule the world had been proclaimed a thousand times , and their strength under various circumstances could be fairly accurately forecast . The unknown quantity was the Western world . How seriously would the West try to resist the Communist expansion ? How ably would it go about that resistance ? <P> Last week the West 's intention looked firmer , its ability brighter than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That Shook the Diplomats . U.S. Ambassador to Britain Lewis W. Douglas emerged last week from an international conference and said : " In ten days more progress has been made than in the preceding three years . " If Douglas was right , the Communist kidnaping of Czechoslovakia had cost Russia more in ten days than it would get out of Czechoslovakia in ten years . <P> Douglas was speaking of an " agreement in principle " between six Western nations on what to do with Germany ( see below ) . It had been reached at long last when the U.S. , goaded by the Czech crisis , stepped up pressure on France . The same Czech crisis had spurred the French to the realization that they had at least as much to fear from Russia as from Germany . Even plainer was the fact that only closest cooperation between the Western powers , including the U.S. , could protect France from either Germany or Russia . <P> Other ripples from the Czech crisis last week reached Brussels , where five Western European nations made rapid progress toward a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain people were talking unity-military , economic and political . <P> Perils Ahead . Dangers , both immediate and long-range , were scarcely dispelled by these hopeful actions . Finland was threatened today ; Austria might be next ; Italy would go through a crucial test in its April 18 elections . Wherever the Communists took power by election , they made sure , as in Poland , that they would never lose it by election . And when they lost elections , as in Czechoslovakia , they sought other roads to power . The democracies had to win every kind of contest every time in every country . The Communists only had to win once ; then the country was withdrawn from contest , and could be liberated only by revolution or war . <P> The chances of World War III depended on the outcome of a whole series of struggles . Europe obviously could not be won without U.S. dollars , but it surely would not be won by dollars alone . What would it take ?
