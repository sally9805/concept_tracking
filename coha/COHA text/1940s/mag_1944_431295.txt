THE room was big and bare . Light from four fat candles tried to fight its way through the gloom , but could get no farther than the little mellow circle around Leonid Lebedev and his three associates , who at about a plain pine desk , the room 's only piece of furniture . Outside there was a constant low rumble as truck after truck rolled west of Kiev , capital of the Ukraine , toward the front ( map , page 516 ) . Every few minutes this rumble would be broken by the high-pitched roar of a tank rumbling by . And then there would be the slug , slug , slug of the hard boots of the soldiers trudging off to fight and die for liberation of the Ukraine . Lebedev , chairman of Kiev 's new City soviet , a blond , smiling young man who looked surprisingly like Jack Benny , stopped what he was saying and listened . From down the road came those unmistakable minor tones of Russian song , tones that always seem so Slavic and melancholy to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in the cold night they were singing as they marched off to battle . I stepped to the window and peeped from behind the blackout . The night was dark , but there was a faint moon , its rays highlighting the tips and sharp edges of the soldiers ' bayonets as they swung by in song . I turned back to Lebedev . He raised his eyes and smiled a proud smile . " You say that sounds sad , " he said . " Well , it is n't . Those soldiers are happy . Why , it 's even a happy song ! Those soldiers are happy because they 're liberating the Ukraine . " Every Russian seems to love the Ukraine . It 's their land of romance , of southern skies , guitars , soft music , and girls with honeycolored hair and bright-blue eyes . But the Ukraine is more than that . It has much of the richest agricultural land in the Soviet Union . It has fine cattle and hogs , and its mineral wealth is far from being fully explored . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Vasili Chervonov , were all young men . While their army fought on up ahead , they stayed here and built as others liberated . There is work to be done in the Ukraine ? millions of man-hours . Rebuilding Cities and Villages Kiev once had close to a million people . Now it has about 70,000 . Throughout the other parts of the Ukraine which the Red Army has freed in its brilliant autumn and winter campaign , it is almost the same story . Hundreds of the Ukraine 's pretty little villages have been burned or blasted from its rich earth . Thousands of head of cattle have been removed to Germany . Enough hens to stock the farmyards of a State in our Midwest have been shipped west by the invaders . Factories have been smashed , set fire to , or blown sky-high with dynamite . All of the fine bridges that spanned the great Dnieper ? water artery of the Ukraine ? have been torn down or scattered in its waters by explosives . The mighty Dnieper Dam in the Dnepropetrovsk sector is ruined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once stately public buildings of its cities have been wrecked . What was once a land of proud beauty has become one of the most desolate places in all of vast Russia . Thousands of collective farms have been robbed of their tractors and of the mechanized farming equipment installed at such great price , labor , and sacrifice by the Soviets . I  |p513  have been into farmhouses where even sewing machines were taken away by the Nazis . But life is slowly taking shape again . Out into the villages the Soviets are sending agricultural experts . These experts are rounding up all the old farmers and women . There are no young men left . They are all in the army or have returned to the soil as soldier dead . The old men and women are gathering day and night with the officials and planning for spring . There are many scenes through the country that tug at one 's heart and make those of us who have been reporting on the war for a long time wonder again why the cold , calculating plans of high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A small village outside Kiev is an example . We were bumping through it in a mudcovered but efficiently humming United Statesmade truck . Our driver wanted a drink of water . He stopped at what had once been a house because he saw some people around a well . An old woman , her shawl wrapped about her head in Ukrainian fashion , was dragging her tired feet through the rubble left by fire . Under her arms she was carrying a picture . " This was your home ? " I asked her . She started and looked at me with frightened old eyes as she took a firmer grip on her picture . " Do n't be afraid , grandmother , " I told her . " I 'm an American . " The old lady relaxed her grip on the picture . " Yes , it 's my house , " she said . " I was born in this village and married here . I have lived in this house for forty-two years .

I do n't have a home any more and I do n't have a husband any more and I do n't know what has happened to my sons . " She tenderly showed me her picture .  |p514  " This was my husband . The night the Germans came through here we ran for the woods . We hid there , and then when we saw the fire my husband said he was going to look to see what was happening . He never came back . What , oh what have they done with him ? " Many " Never Came Back " Vera Kravchenko 's husband is not the only man who disappeared like that . Soviet reports almost every week carry a dispatch about the advanced column of the Red Army , which has come across a long column of Russian civilians being marched westward as the German Army retreats . There have been cases of as many as ten thousand being herded down a snowy road by German Tommy gunners . Think of those the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the Ukraine I have seen villages like the one where Vera Kravchenko lived ? little places that happened to be in the way of a big mechanized army and got wiped out . They , too , are rising again . In many places old men who managed to hide their broad axes from the invader have gone into the forests , felled trees , and cut them with their own hands into boards . Then they have dragged the boards back to their villages to make places where they can sleep and be warm . Until the authorities have moved in with sawmills and lumber , these peasants have followed more or less the same system . Where their houses once stood they have dug out basements . They have cut trench doorways leading to these square holes in the ground . With the wood they have cut from the forests they have made walls which rise from the ground about five feet . On top of them they have built little slanting roofs , and their women have put on a quick thatching to hold back the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have modeled little fireplaces , and with anything they managed to save they have moved in . Thousands upon thousands of Ukrainians lived this way this winter , and in the fierce patriotism that has swept through their land they are at home again ? deeply wounded , to be sure , but at least there is a roof over their heads , and warmth ; and it is theirs , not the Germans ' . Ukrainians Love Song and Dance Ukrainians , above all other Russians , I believe , love song and dance . I do not necessarily mean the opera and the ballet and the symphony , for they rightly belong to Leningrad and Moscow. * But I mean simple melodies with harmony , and dances into which boys and girls , husbands and wives , and even old men and women throw themselves with an abandon that is fine to see . I have met many Ukrainians since I came to the Soviet Union in 1941 and I do n't recall one of them who could n't sing or dance ? or at least would n't try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above all other people I know , seem to have . It would be very hard for a Ukrainian to live without making music or without turning a toe or slapping a foot to music . Realizing this , Soviet authorities quickly did something about it . It may seem strange to tell that singers and dancers followed the Red Army into many areas . But that is what happened , and they were just about as welcome as the soldiers themselves . I had the great pleasure of attending the opening performance at the Kiev Opera House after the Germans had retreated . For some reason they did not destroy the Opera House or its lighting system . I do n't know why this was . Perhaps they just did not have time , for they fired everything else around the city that seemed to have anything to do with culture , including the University Library and some of the buildings of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences . It was an unforgettable evening . The house was dark when we entered because the manager had to save precious gasoline to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We felt our way to our seats  |p517  and just sat there . A few of us had flashlights , and they made a strange sight as they cut through the dark house , showing the way for Red Army men and women and citizens of Kiev who were coming to see their first entertainment by their own people in over two years . The Germans had kept the Kiev Opera House going nightly when they occupied the city . They used some Russians -- much against their will ? but most of the Soviet performers who got caught in the city wriggled out of performing in one way or another . Moscow had sent out a number of artists to fill in on the bill , but the bulk of the cast was Ukrainian . They sang that night with notes that came from the heart , not from the lungs . We felt the reality of the front , too , because the performance was punctuated throughout by Red Army guards entering with bavo neted guns and calling out for this and that officer and private . There were soldiers sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rifles sticking up from between their seats . All of the reoccupied cities are experienc ing the same thing . Theaters which were not destroyed by the Germans were opened almost immediately . and where there are no theaters , standing per formances are being put on in the best and biggest place available . Guitars and Accordions for Reoccupied Areas Moscow has sent several loads of guitars and accordions to the Ukraine , for Stalin who knows his people perhaps better than any other national leader realizes these items are just as lm portant in rebuilding the occupied areas as are bread , meat . clothes , and tractors ( page 520 ) . This summer when the great yellow moons of the steppe spread their golden light over the fields , sowed this time with Soviet grain . songs of the Ukrainians will float once more out into the soft Russian night . Who will be there to play for them and who will have strength enough after a hard day 's work , much of which is being done by hand this year , you may ask . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . " Have a heart and have a soul . All else is passing fashion , " may be a saving among a great many Russians , but in the Ukraine the ancient saying should include the guitar also .  |p518  I spent a very happy evening one night in the Ukraine with some people who had a guitar , warm hearts , and certainly souls . They started things out with a bowl of borsch , that wonderful red soup of the Ukrainians ; and so far as I am concerned it ended with a wellknown Ukrainian poet ? I said poet ? kissing me smack on the mouth , his flowing white mustaches thrown in . This old man said he had been composing poetry since he was nine , but he simply could not do it while the Germans were around . But now , " he declared , throwing wide his arms , " we are free . Our Red Army is here . and look , we may not have much more than borsch , but we have our music . Why , we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was going to write any more poetry . " Write poetry ? " he asked in amazement . " Can that boy help playing a guitar ? I 've got to write , just as he has to play . We are Ukrainians . " It was this kind of people that Erich Koch , Hitler 's boss of the occupied Ukraine , tried to induce to turn out crops for Germany ? willingly . He told them that if they excelled in their labors for the Wehrmacht , he planned to re-establish private ownership of the land in the Ukraine and that the peasants would enjoy such " benefits . " The peasants became slightly disturbed when they found some of the handbills which Koch had passed out to the Nazi soldiers . They read : " I as Commandant of the Ukraine and by the Fuehrer 's will , must open her up and make her useful for the New Order in Europe . The question is to bring in a new population , which will be the greatest work in European history . I am doing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your names or your money : I ask only for your faith in National Socialism . " Farmers Effective at Sabotage Relatively speaking , the Nazi occupants of the lush Ukraine got very little from her rich vastness . Chief reason was lack of cooperation among the people . From what I have seen of the war , I believe the farmer can hold out better against the invader than members of any other group of society . A farmer has a way of seeming to work  |p519  without working . He can plant his seeds under supervision , and still they wo n't grow into much . He can till his land in the same way , and he can harvest his crops with the fine art of sabotage . This happened on a wide scale in the Ukraine . It was impossible for the Germans to watch everything . They had hundreds of so-called agricultural agents and they had their Gestapo , but back in the steppe lands and behind the woods and all along the little rivers and streams of the Ukraine the Soviet guerrilla was at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans , and when encouragement was not needed , he showed them how to wreck quietly the best-laid schemes of Nazi planners of the " New Order . " Unlike Germany , the Ukraine does not have fences spread about its fields . Cows , hogs , and chickens have a kind of communal way of hanging around their respective collective farms . When the Germans failed to find fences , they asked the peasants how they kept from losing their stock . " We do n't , " lied the farmers and their wives . " We must have wire to build fences . We have been losing our cows , chickens , hogs , and sheep for centuries , and we will keep on losing them . " Finding enough wire to fence in the Ukraine was too much for factual-minded Nazis . They told the Russian peasants they would just have to do the best they could . They gave them stiff warnings not to let their animals get lost , but the peasants only shook their shaggy heads and said the Germans asked the impossible . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , German agricultural agents ? who flew into rages many times ? accepted the situation as caused by a lack of wire . When the Red Army withdrew from the Ukraine in the first year of the war , it did not have time to take everything with it . Numerous pieces of farming equipment had to be left behind , especially in remote areas . The Germans used some of these in trying to till the land , but many of them , too , were sabotaged . Those that were . still in working order were shipped back toward Germany when the Red Army advanced in its present offensive . The Ukraine is badly in need of farm machinery , and it is being hurried here as fast as the Soviets can get it . There is a big struggle to make an all-out showing in spring planting this year , but from the Russian authorities with whom I talked , I got the impression that this will be very difficult . Machinery is one of the worst problems . Most of the Soviet Union 's tractor fa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out tanks and other monsters war . Tractors , of course , are being made and will continue to be made throughout the war , no matter how long it lasts . But in a nation a tremendous as this ? one that occupies roughly one-seventh of the earth 's land surface ? many many tractors , harvesters , and other types agricultural machinery are needed . It is gigantic task , and it is going to take several years to get the Ukraine back on the production basis it once enjoyed as the breadbasket of this Nation . The Nazis brought few pieces of farm machinery into the Ukraine , and the genera : result was that the peasants tilled largely by hand . I am afraid many of them will have to continue this way until the Government can get full supplies into the land . Many of the officials I interviewed hoped America could send over some mechanical equipment , but they realized , naturally , that our contribution must , in the scale of things . be small ( pages 515 , 523 ) . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited some of the United States ' finest farming lands around Lancaster , Pennsylvania , and in other States , and found that the farmers through these areas also were in need of farming equipment , especially parts . Factories Blasted and Burned One of the Ukraine 's biggest factories which turned out parts for farming plant . Then , when they were driven out , they converted the factory into one of the most thorough piles of rubble I have seen in this war . The factory was a couple of city blocks long and about a block wide . The Nazis set about a hundred charges of explosives in the walls and under the supports and set them off all at once . Using anything of the former factory is out of the question . Another parts factory will be built in the capital of the Ukraine , but it will have to be on a brandnew scale . The same thing happened in Kharkov . Before the war , the Soviets manufactured a considerable amount of farming machinery in this city of once-numerous modern factories and buildings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they evacuated they blew them up or burned their insides out . Kharkov , generally speaking ,  |p526  was burned , whereas Kiev was blasted and burned . In rebuilding these factories and bringing new farming equipment to the Ukraine , such cities as Krivoi Rog , Kirovograd , and Nikopol must , of necessity , play a big role . As this issue goes to press , the long Battle of the Ukraine is all but ended . Scattering the invader 's divisions in the Dnieper 's Big Bend , the Red Army has crossed the Dniester into Romanian-held Bessarabia . To the north , it has broken into prewar Poland ( map , page 516 ) . Krivoi Rog 's high-grade iron ore is available for rebuilding the Ukraine . Some 60 percent of prewar Russia 's iron ore came from Krivoi Rog . Nikopol 's recapture makes the task still easier , for this city mines manganese , the steel strengthener . Kirovograd was once one of the biggest grain centers of the Ukraine . It will soon return to that role , for the Germans were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Konev 's Army of the second Ukrainian front that they did not have much opportunity to lay waste the grain elevators and mills . The Ukraine needs power and needs it badly for rebuilding . The tremendous Dnieper Dam , which the Russians destroyed as they fell back in August , 1941 , supplied the Ukraine with much of the electricity which turned the wheels of its many mills and factories , and that , of course , can not be replaced for a long time ( page 531 ) . Realizing full well the part power plays , the Germans consistently went for the lighting plants whenever they were forced from the cities by the drives of the Ukrainian armies . This is greatly handicapping the Soviets in bringing old life back to the reoccupied land . Kharkov and Kiev , the two biggest cities of the Ukraine , did not have a power plant left , a bulb burning , a streetcar running , or hardly an electric wire left intact after the Germans left . The Plight of Kharkov Kharkov was one of the worst messes I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city electric wires and telephone wires hung limply from poles like giant strings of spaghetti . The Nazis sent out squads equipped with special shears atop long poles , and they systematically cut the wires between every two poles . Outside Kiev , especially to the north where power lines ran  |p527  into rich agricultural lands , they repeated this operation ( page 519 ) . I have ridden along roads here for ten to twenty miles and seen wires snipped every hundred feet ; yet the Russians by now have established much order in these public utilities . Kharkov , Kiev , and even badly wrecked Poltava , have electricity and coal , and wooddriven engines are spinning dynamos . It will take months , perhaps even years , for the Soviets to electrify the Ukraine as thoroughly as they did before Hitler 's invasion . Many a little hut had electricity in those days , but I am afraid it is going to be candlelight for a long time . Government Helps Small Business It is factories and mines of the Donets coal basin that must have power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along on a rapid scale . And in Stalino and Voroshilovgrad industry is getting a foothold again , but it takes driving and sweating and long hours . One of the most interesting features of reconstruction of the Ukraine is the Government 's encouragement of individuals opening small enterprises for private profit . The first official notice of this came in Kiev in Pravda , the city 's leading newspaper , which the Russians started printing the first week after the city 's recapture . The notice advised any citizen , who so desired and who had the qualifications , to start a small business . This is not so radical as it might seem at  |p528  first , for profit is allowable on a small scale and under certain conditions under the Soviet Constitution . Private enterprise must compete against State trade , however , and taxes on it are high . A number of restaurants have sprung up in several cities as a result of this policy . The owner goes about operating in the following fashion : He applies to the cooperative trading organization of his city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating . If the officials feel he is capable of carrying on his business , they rent space to him , usually where he wants it . From then on he is more or less on his own . Restaurant operators then go into the country or to market and buy up all the cabbage they can locate to make borsch . They purchase pigs , chickens , eggs where they can find them , striking bargains with the peasants , who are allowed to sell or to do as they please with anything raised or produced above the norm allotted them . The operators must then make their own arrangements about hiring cooks , waitresses , and waiters ; finding cooking utensils , plates , and so on ; and getting together enough chairs and tables for their customers . Authorities help out where they can . It may sound like a terrific undertaking . Frankly it is , but lots of these little businesses are under way . A cooperative tobacco factory , manned by Ukrainians invalided by war , is being planned . Officials do not predict how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the general impression is they will exist during the reconstruction at least . When I was in Kiev several restaurants were already operating and doing a big business . German Printing-press Money The Germans flooded the Ukraine with their printing-press money when they came in . It is still around almost everywhere , but it is worthless . The Soviets did not redeem it , and virtually every Ukrainian has a sock full of it . I brought back some for souvenirs after a recent visit to the occupied area . A peasant woman was delighted to receive some Russian rubles for it . The trouble was that when word got out ? and it gets out fast in the Ukraine ? that some crazy Americans wanted to buy some German money and would pay good rubles for it , we were swamped . Folks young and old came from wood and valley , and it became very difficult to tell these kind people that we wanted only a few pieces of German money for keepsakes and to show in Moscow . The money was designed fairly artistically , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of it had worn through in two years ' handling . It was printed in German and the Ukrainian language and usually bore a portrait of the German conception of a Ukrainian maiden or young man . " What are the . liberated peoples doing for money ? " I asked . Officials described the uniform plan . As soon as possible they block out what enterprises , what factories , what rebuilding , what schools , what places of entertainment and municipal services can be started soonest . They call in people for jobs and , after consultation with them , assign workers to various positions . However , the choice is mostly up to the individual . He can apply for whatever job he wants . After questioning them on their qualifications and experience , the authorities then advance their people money against their earnings . There is no interest , and the money may be paid back just about as a worker wishes . This policy is very broad and extremely elastic , it was explained , because the persons with whom the Government is dealing have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered aplenty . " Help Wanted " Signs Urgent Every City Soviet ? a kind of town hall ? which I visited in the Ukraine had its outer wall plastered with notices of " Help Wanted . " It is a heartening sight to see these people out in front of the City Soviets studying notices , most of which are written out in longhand . Building trades want men and women for bricklaying . The carpenters ' trust wants experienced labor ? " Please bring saws and hammers if Germans did not steal them from you . " The city school system wants teachers ? wants them immediately . Plumbers please apply at such and such a place . Electricians badly wanted . And there are already notices for girls to drive streetcars and buses . In many sectors the Soviets have hurried in instructors and teachers , responsible persons who can teach quickly the basic principles of a trade to young boys and girls or to older people who are willing to learn something about a busihess in which they , in their worst dreams , never imagined they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been encouraging . Spring planting and work on collective farms have not drawn so many applicants as are needed so far . This is to be expected , for  |p529  most people who live in a city prefer to continue to live there even though their homes have been ruined by the invaders . They want to start fixing up the old place . Authorities in the Ukraine have plunged into the difficult task of getting everyone registered and identified again . Care is taken before handing a new Soviet passport to an applicant . During the occupation , the Germans took up all Soviet papers and issued new ones ? German identification cards to citizens . This process of sorting everyone out again , taking down his former address , occupation , relatives , and so on is a time-consuming job and , of course , requires hours of detail . A citizen usually has someone known to the authorities to vouch for him , and generally this is sufficient . Raising the Sunken Dnieper Fleet During this winter the Kiev river front has been one of the busiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the Dnieper the sunken Dnieper fleet . This is a little-known story . When the Red Army advanced across the steppe east of the Ukrainian capital , and the Nazi commanders saw that they could not hold the Russian push , they ordered the sinking of all ships , boats , and barges along the river . The Dnieper is readily navigable , and the larger portion of its steamers and barges tie up here for the winter . In their great haste the Nazis ordered up dynamite and assigned special squadrons to this job . They did not want the craft to fall into the Soviets ' hands in usable condition . " Blow them into the heavens , " was the order . When the dynamite squad arrived at the river to set off the charges , they found many of the ships sunk , and those that had not reached the bottom were slowly settling .  |p534  While Nazi officers screamed and raged on the bank , the ships disappeared , and they had to take their dynamite back and put it under more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Soviet rivermen , who had been left behind in Germanoccupied territory , heard of the plan to blow up the Dnieper fleet . In the dark hours the Russians stole to the river bank and , climbing aboard many vessels , opened enough valves and petcocks to sink most of the ships . Where they did n't have time , they cut holes in the bottoms . None of these patriots was caught . Then the Red Army came in and , when there were time and workers , authorities began the hard , long job of raising the vessels . Konstantin Guzykin took charge . " In two months , " Guzykin reported in January , " we have raised as many boats as we would have raised in such operations in eight months before the war . " I realize , " he added , " that the secret of this lies not in any high degree of mechanization , but in hard work , pure and simple . Everything depended on the workers themselves . " The raising of a fleet which numbers more than a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clock or Overtime During the height of the activity , when rivermen were rushing to get the ships to the surface and into dockyards in time to repair them for spring navigation , there was no such thing as a time clock or overtime checks . Workers just worked , that 's all . Diver Ivan Zemlyany made 15 trips to the icy bottom of the Dnieper in one day . The water was exceedingly cold despite his thick diving suit , which was not heated , and 15 trips is a high degree of patriotism in that kind of water . Uacob Levin , director of Kiev 's repair shipyard , went four days and nights with hardly more than a couple of hours of sleep . Besides managing the shipyard , he lent a hand in repairing and supervised some of the electrical jobs and foundry work . Directors of the project were shorthanded , for , as stated before , man power is scarce in the Ukraine . " We simply do n't have enough people , " said Levin during some of his busiest hours . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kiev , but the rest of Kiev , we realize , has duties , too . We 've just got to work on . " It was a hard battle against time , for the Dnieper , of all the rivers of the liberated Ukraine , needed ships for spring and summer . The Nazis left the railways and roads in bad shape . Military traffic must pour over these communication lines as the Red Army drives westward , and never before were ships so valuable . Ships " Manned " by Women The Russians take advantage of their broad , deep rivers and are excellent rivermen . The traffic these vessels will handle before next fall will be amazing . Women play a great role , too . Just as some ships on the Volga are manned by women captains , engineers , and stevedores , the same thing is planned for the Dnieper fleet. * The Soviet Union has an increasing number of women boatmen . They seem to like their work , too .
