The New Spirit ( Disney ) reveals the astonishing fact that one of the world 's most beloved cinema actors earns less than $50 a week . That miserable retainer not only has to support himself in the extravagant style to which Hollywood is accustomed , but also has to feed , clothe and house his three adopted nephews . This underpaid box-office paragon : Donald Duck . <P> Bachelor Duck has complained about a lot of things , but his salary ( $2,501 ) is not one of them . Its revelation is pure patriotism on his part . His employer , Walt Disney ( whose reputation is any thing but a pinchpenny 's ) , was asked by U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr . to make a picture reminding U.S. citizens that millions of them are expected to pay an income tax for the first time this year . <P> The New Spirit , an eight-minute cartoon short , opens with the indignant Duck throbbing to a radio voice telling of the new spirit in the U.S. Exhorts the radio : " Your country needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag-wave as he implores the radio to tell him how he can help . Says the inexorable machine : " By paying your income tax . " <P> Donald , at that , is fit to be tied . But the radio goes to work on him . " Taxes to beat the Axis ! " it chants . When the Duck realizes what armament his money will buy , he ca n't wait for Tax Day . His pen , blotter , inkwell , account book go to work on his short-form income-tax blank ( for incomes under $3,000 ) . Donald finds he owes a $13 tax . He scurries all the way to Washington to get it in on time . <P> Although the cartoon does not make the new short-form blank crystal clear , it gets its propaganda across with the anesthetic blessing of laughter and great good humor . As cinema , The New Spirit is a most effective job . It has a brand-new patriotic melody , The Yankee Doodle Spirit ( composed in one day by Oliver Wallace , who did the Dumbo tunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disney has anything to say about it , U.S. World War II propaganda will be leavened with a humor and an artistry that were absent from World War I 's . The New Spirit is his first U.S. Government film . Made in four weeks , it set a record for the studio , which usually takes six to eight months for a short . <P> Disney 's facilities are now 75% given over to wartime production . His schedule : 20 cartoons for the Navy on airplane and warship identification ; eleven more for the U.S. Treasury ; 52 for the State Department , promoting Allied and Hemisphere solidarity ; twelve for the Rockefeller Committee and its Hemisphere good-will program ; one for the Department of Agriculture , publicizing Lend-Lease aid to the Allies ; a recruiting short for the U.S. Merchant Marine ; three more bond-selling shorts , and an Army anti-tank-rifle training film for Canada ; a series of U.S. Army training films similar to the Navy 's . <P> Sullivan 's Travels ( Paramount ) . Scenarist Preston Sturges , who became a cinema director two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( The Great McGinty ) , advertising ( Christmas in July ) , and the boy-meets-girl formula ( The Lady Eve ) . He now aims his brisk sarcasm at the moviemakers themselves .
