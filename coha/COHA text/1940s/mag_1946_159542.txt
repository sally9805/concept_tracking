INDIA <P> The armed might of the British Raj stood on the alert for further trouble . Although mutinous seamen returned to their duties , sympathy strikes broke out . Boiling India last week had cooled down to a simmer . <P> General Sir Claude Auchinleck , British Commander in Chief in India , made two concessions : 1 ) Indian troops , whose recall from Indonesia was demanded by nationalist rioters , will be withdrawn within five months ; 2 ) there will be no mass punishment of mutineers and rioters . <P> But even while Indian leaders were condemning the mutiny and riots , there were threats of further violence . Simmering India might soon boil again .
