txt Hope for the success of the Israeli-Egyptian armistice talks rose high tonight when the delegations concluded their second meeting with an announcement that they had concluded discussion of one item on their agenda and had agreed on the preamble to an armistice agreement  --  all in fifteen minutes . On Egyptian insistence , details of the meeting were kept secret . However , unless the draft agenda was changed after its submission to yesterday 's meeting , " item three , " which they concluded today , covered assurances against further attacks by either side or // the infringement of each other 's territory . The communique said only that ' the meeting had begun at 4:30 P. M. , that it had lasted fifteen minutes and tia .. " item three " had been concluded , after which the delegates had approved " a document setting forth a number of principles which both parties have agreed to and which will constitute the preamble of the armistice agreement which is being negotiated . " United Nations circles here , however , no longer seem to consider failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody is far too cautious te say so openly . Bunche Sees Both Sides The system being used is to go over the ground with each delegation separately beforehand , so that there is no risk of striking unexpected snags that would delay the proceedings in plenary session . Dr. Bunche saw both sides this morning , and it was noteworthy that when they all met together they settled two distinct points in fifteen minutes without any of the ' wrangling over procedure so customary in United Nations sessions . Lebanon may soon join the armistice talks here , it is rumored , but a qualified United Nations official said that it would be pointless to invite Lebanon or other countries until it was certain that the talks Iwith Egypt were going to succeed . At that point , he said , it was likely that all the Arab countries , would finally consent to discuss the armistice . The Lebanese were meeting the Israelis ' today at Ras en Naqura , on the coast at the frontier , to discuss the evacuation of Lebanese territory held by Israeli forces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evacuation was an indispensable condition before they would consider any talk of an armistice . Constantine Stavropoulos of the Mediator 's staff left by air this morning for Beirut , but the trip was said to have been merely for the purpose of reporting on the meeting at Ras en Naqura . In Deepest Mystery The Egyptian delegates have insisted on shrouding the meetings in the deepest mystery possible . They objected to being photographed and flatly refused Dr. Bunche 's request that the meetings be open to correspondents . The communiqu ? , as originally drafted yesterday , gave details of the agenda but the Egyptians insisted on their suppressiim . The delegations were still preparing tonight for the most ticklish items on the agenda  --  those coverbig the withdrawal of troops and their reduction , and the establishment of permanent armistice lines and neutral zones , as provided by the Security Council resolutions of Nov. 4 and 16 . The next point to come up is expected to be the Faluja pocket where an Egyptian brigade was cut off by Israel and still is virtually isolated . No date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further conferences by each delegation with Dr. Bunche will precede it . The critical stage for the talks , however , will come when they reach the discussion of the withdrawal . In the past the Egyptians have always insisted that it must mean restoration of the lines as held before the Israelis launched their offensive in the Negeb on Oct. 14 . Israel never has shown any disposition to accept that view . Ask Reduction in Strength The Security Council 's resolutions also call on the Israelis to reduce the strength of their forces in the field , to establish permanent armistice lines beyond which neither may advance and to arrange neutral zones between their lines into which neither side would penetrate . Each side naturally is anxious to make sure that it yields no more than the other , and both sides ? but especially the Egyptians  --  are keenly conscious of the opinion at home . The Israelis always have been willing to accept an armistice though the question of the terms might be discussed , but the Egyptian public has been nourished on that idea that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
