MAKE THIS THE LAST WAR-Michael Straighf-Harcourt , Brace ( $3 ) . <P> LET THE PEOPLE KNOW-Norman Angell-Viking ( $2.50 ) . <P> When the curtain rises on the post-war world the scene may be something like this : 6,000,000 German soldiers fleeing in disorder ; 5,000,000 foreign workers and prisoners of war abandoning Germany ; 2,000,000 Hungarian , Rumanian , Bulgarian and Spanish soldiers pouring home from the Eastern front ; 3,000,000 Poles straggling back to their wasted territory ; 50,000,000 Soviet citizens surging back into western Russia . <P> These desperate homegoers will return to many villages that have been destroyed and towns that have been razed or are filled with strangers . They will bring with them orphans , old and insane folk . They will bring scurvy , trachoma , malaria , typhus , and dysentery from eating grass and earth . Starvation may be so prevalent that the cannibalism of 1919 may again strike eastern Europe . Railroads that should carry these desperate people will be totally disorganized ; horses may all have been eaten . No reserves of fuel and clothing will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide them . China , Japan , Malaya , The Netherlands East Indies will repeat this picture in other versions . <P> Such is Author Michael Straight 's conception of the post-war scene . His Make This the Last War attempts to provide a plan-of-life not only for these desperate multitudes but for people the world over . Son of the late Willard Straight ( founder of The New Republic , of which Author Straight is an editor ) and brother of R.A.F. Acting Air Commodore Whitney Willard Straight , Author Straight took a triple-first degree in economics at Cambridge University , worked in the State Department as economist of the European Division . Now 26 , he is awaiting induction as an aviation cadet in the U.S. Air Corps . <P> No such youngster is beknighted Nobel Peace Prizewinner Sir Norman Angell . At 68 Sir Norman has written 32 books , sat in the British Parliament , worked five years in the U.S. as a ranch hand . The British Empire 's most noted apologist in America , Sir Norman 's latest views on the post-war world have caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its February choice along with Tregaskis ' Guadalcanal Diary . <P> Sir Norman describes himself as " a Socialist in the British Labour Party or the American New Deal sense of the term , " admits that " Socialists differ . . as to what Socialism really is . " Safely unSocialist is his view of the causes and cures of World War II . Let the People Know attempts to convince " the average busy citizen " that wars are not caused by capitalists , vested interests , empires , divisions into Haves and Havenots . Wars come , he believes , because ordinary men are mis-educated , prejudiced . They come , especially , because man is nationalistically minded .
