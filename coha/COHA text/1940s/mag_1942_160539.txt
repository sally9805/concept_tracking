Soldiers of the American Revolution had the privilege of sending mail free-even before there was a U.S. A century later the privilege of the frank was so grossly abused and over-extended that Congress abolished it , restored it two years later to a comparative handful of free mailers : Supreme Court justices , Cabinet members , members of Congress , Government officials ( for transmission of official business ) . Last week the Yanks joined the frank ranks . <P> The President signed the second War Powers Bill , authorizing postage-free transmission of " any first-class letter mail matter . . . which is sent by a member of the military and naval forces of the United States " to families , sweethearts and friends in the U.S. , its possessions and territories .
