txt ALLIES IN ACCORD President Reveals Stalin Was Informed of Plan by Churchill ' NOW IT CAN BE TOLD ' How Decision on Second Front Move Was Made Is Described By W. 11 . LAWRENCE Special to Tag NEW Toss TISIES . WASHINGTON . Nov. 10 ? Declaring that a second front has to be tailor-made and custom-built and can not be purchased ready made in a department store , President Roosevelt gave his press conference today a detailed account of the months of planning that preceded the French North African expedition and the limiting factors that made impossible a large-scale Allied offensive across the English Channel before the middle of 1943 . In excellent humor . Mr. Roosevelt leaned back in his chair , puffing on a cigarette and described tersely how Prime Minister Winston Churchill and he had decided on the African offensive as early as the end of June , but had to take it on the chin in silence when ignorant outsiders , who could not have been cognizant of the fact , were demanding something  --  a second , front  --  that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their principal fighting allies . Chronology of Planning The President 's chronology of offensive planning , with the first decision to attack across the English Channel being changed to an expedition into French North Africa . cleared up a major change in language relating to a second front from the June 12 joint communiqu ? issued by Mr. Roosevelt and Vyacheslaff M. Molotoff , Soviet Foreign Commissar , and the June 27 joint statement of the President and Prime Minister Churchill . On June 12 , when the President and Commissar Molotoff said that the United States and Russia had reached a full understanding on the " urgent tasks of creating a second front in Europe in 1942 , " a final decision to abandon the Channel offensive in favor of the North African attack had not yet been made , it appeared from the President 's recital . But on June 27 , when the President and Prime Minister said simply that coming operations by the military forces of the United Nations would " divert German strength from the attack on Russia , " this government and Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa . The final decisions on the North African move , including the points of attack , the number of men to be employed and the problems of transport and naval protection , were settled toward the end of July at the London conferences of the Prime Minister and British military and naval leaders with General George C. Marshall , Army Chief of Staff ; Admiral Ernest J. King , Commander in Chief of the United States Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations , and Harry L. Hopkins , personal representative of the President . The actual date of attack was decided by the end of August , he said . As the President explained it , in response to a request for a " now it can be told story , " the inception of the offensive action in which the American and British armies are engaged in North Africa goes back to about two weeks after Pearl Harbor , when the President invited Prime Minister Churchill and his joint staff to COM " to Washington just before Christmas . The time had come , tie said , // ALLIES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two Allied nations that had the most military and naval forces . They discussed the desirability of offensive action , the President said , and various offensives were considered , especially the possi , bility of a very large frontal attack across the English Channel . This was considered in the light of ' the problems involved ? having sufficient materiel , especially airplanes , to make the operation reasonably sure of success , and the problem of shipping men and materiel to the other side in time . At that time the military opinion was that the proposal was feasible , and a good deal of work toward this end was done , he added . But the more it was studied , the President went on , the more it became apparent that , because of physical limitations , an attack across the Channel could not be carried out in the year 1942 . The physical limitations enumerated by the President were the production of munitions , the training of sufficient men , and the transportation of men and materials to the other side . Therefore , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of May or the beginning of June to consider the issue of an offensive on a very large scale , which would be compulsory if an attack across the Channel were to be made , some time around the middle of 1943 , or of starting in 1942 an offensive on a smaller scale , in which the problems of manufacture , training and transport would not be so great . Mr. Churchill and he , aided by the combined Chiefs of Staff , surveyed the possibility of an offensive more limited in scope , and by the end of June , general agreement on the African offensive had been reached . By the end of July , certain fundamentals of it , such as the points of attack , the numbers of men involved , and the shipping problems , had been determined upon . After this conference Prime Minister Churchill flew to Moscow to acquaint Premier Joseph Stalin with the decisions . Interrupting his chronology , the I President observed that it was about that time that people began talking about a second front  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the end of August , he said , the date had been decided on . But , the President said , Mr. Churchill and he had to sit by and take on the chin in silence the demands of ignorant outsiders . At the suggestion of Stephen T. Early , White House press secretary , the President explained that he did not mean the adjective ignorant to be a term of reproach , but merely a statement that persons outside the top military and governmental leadership could not be cognizant of the decisions that had been reached and plans that had been made . Both Mr. Churchill and he had discovered about a year ago that in a world war you ca n't walk down the street and go into a department store and purchase and walk out with a second front , the President went on . They found out that they are tailor-made and custombuilt . If you 're going to have one anywhere in the world , you first have to decide on the suit material and then take it to an expert clothesmaker and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A lot of folks have now discovered that fact , he said . It is a good rule in all wars , he added , to know that if you send an expedition out without careful planning , only in rare instances will it succeed , and then only if the other fellow makes all the mistakes . But with hundreds of thousands of lives involved , you should try to coordinate operations with a reasonable chance of success . The North African offensive took a great deal of preparation , he said , and had to be tied in with operations all over the world , to find out what we had in totals of men , planes , tanks , guns and other munitions in order to discover whether we would have to rob Peter to pay Paul . One question that had to be settled was whether certain objectives would have to be surrendered in order to achieve others . You ca n't carry out at top speed objectives all over the world whether you would like to or not , he went on . You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total manpower , and getting the men and weapons to the place where you fight the enemy . All this goes back to the fact that you ca n't buy a second front in a department store ready made , he observed . Mr. Roosevelt was asked to relate his chronology to the second front agreement with Mr. Molotoff . Without revealing military secrets the President said that reporters could assume that our principal fighting Allies had been taken into consultation before anything was done . One reporter noted that Mr. Early had been present at the London conference in July when the final decision for the North African offensive had been reached , and the President laughed and said that he thought Steve had done the whole thing . One reporter asked if the decision to give up a frontal attack across the Channel this year was related in any way to the Dieppe raid , where Allied losses were very heavy . The President said that the Dieppe raid and things all over the world , including China , were considered in second front discussions . Another reporter asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the November elections in this country . The President said that the date had been picked without any thought of the elections . With obvious reference to the large Republican gains in last Tuesday 's election , he added that only this morning James F. Byrnes , Economic Stabilization Director , had remarked that it was an anomaly that while the President had shifted the celebration of Thanksgiving one week ahead , he had not been able in the case of the North African expedition to move the elections back one week . The implication was that the Republican gains would have been less if the news from the war fronts had been so encouraging when citizens cast their ballots . Continuing his detailing of preparations the President said his numerous letters to Marshal Petain of France , Generalissimo Francisco Franco of Spain and the others had been written about a month ago , and two or three days after that he recorded in the Cabinet room his speech in French that was broadcast to the people of France . Only Admiral William D. Leahy , his Chief of Staff ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two special operators were present when the transcription was made , he said . The President was reluctant to discuss future offensive actions in relation to the North African expedition , declaring that he did n't want any one to assume that the total of expected offensive had been limited in any way by the present operations . To questions about invading Italy and similar moves , the President quoted with approval the remark of Secretary of State Cordell Hull : " Let 's get firmly established in Africa before we talk about the future . " President Roosevelt warned strongly against over-optimism . He recalled an earlier warning by himself against giving way to peaks of over-confidence and valleys of depression . We must not get unduly optimistic over this action , Mr. Roosevelt said , just as it is useless to get unduly pessimistic over reverses . The President explained the lack of news in Washington regarding the invasion as due to planning by which a lot of very good American news reporters were taken with the invasion forces . These men , he added , can see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London . On the other hand , Mr. Roosevelt added , the military leaders who report to Washington are in much the same position as the soldier who said he was too busy dodging bullets to write letters .
