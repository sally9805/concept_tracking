In the Juan Fernandez Islands , 300 miles off the Chilean coast , the lobster season was in full swing . From now until August , the goletas ( sloops ) would bring into Valparaiso some 150,000 lobsters-the island 's one cash crop . Shipped to Santiago or flown over the Andes to Buenos Aires , the langostas ( unlike the Maine lobster , they are clawless ) would bring fancy prices ( $2 to $3 ) in the toniest restaurants of the Chilean and Argentine capitals . <P> Practically the only other island income comes from an occasional hardy tourist who makes the five-to-six-day trip from Valparaiso to see where Robinson Crusoe ( who ate goat meat , turtle eggs , but no lobsters ) was famously marooned . <P> Literary Material . It was on Ms-a-Tierra ( Landward ) , largest ( 58 square miles ) of the Juan Fernndez Islands , that a Scottish sailor named Alexander Selkirk was put ashore in 1704 after a row with his captain . There he lived in rugged solitude for four years . When he got back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and from his account Daniel Defoe wrote The Life and Strange Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe. * <P> Today , on the side of the hill that was Selkirk 's lookout is a bronze tablet , put up in his memory by the captain and officers of a British ship which visited the island in 1868 . Hard by the beach where Crusoe found Friday is now a fishing village , San Juan Bautista . In it live most of the 560 Juan Fernndians . Sixty live on the smaller island of Ms-a-Fuera , 90 miles farther out . Santa Clara , third of the group , is uninhabited . <P> San Juan Bautista has no movies , only three stores . Streets are mud lanes , and there are no hotels . The single school-house takes pupils only through the third grade . The islands have no doctor . <P> Cash Crop . The town centers around the wharf and the offices of the three lobster companies that hold lobstering concessions from the government . All the dories on the beach are owned by the companies , which supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn the lobstermen go out to set and pull their pots , returning at dusk to sell their lobsters to the companies for ten pesos ( 30 ) apiece . For the fishermen and their families , life in the Juan Fernndez is monotonous and lonely , and the sea is full of danger . Even so , they say , they prefer it to the unknown risks of life " on the continent . " <P> <P> * Robinson Crusoe is not the only literary offspring of the Juan Fernndez . In 1719 , a mariner aboard the English privateer Speedwell shot a black albatross . Seven months later , the Speedwell was wrecked on Ms-a-Tierra 's rocky shore . On that episode Samuel Taylor Coleridge based the shooting of the albatross in The Rime oj the Ancient Mariner .
