Nothing brings out the artist in able Painter Julien Binford like a chocolaty skin . His Negroes are something that Negroes admire . Sixteen new Binfords made his one-man show last week at Manhattan 's Midtown Galleries look like a black-belt village on Saturday afternoon . The canvases showed Negroes playing harmonicas , shooting craps , teaching Sunday school , and a vigorous study of two bucks locked together in a razor fight ( one of Painter Binford 's childhood memories ) . In most of these pictures , somber tones of the sooty bodies and faces stood out in contrast to the brilliant light of a lamp , the yellow interior of a church at night , the flame of a match . All reveal Artist Binford 's understanding of Negroes . <P> Born in Powhatan County , Va . of an old Southern family , tall , good-looking Julien Binford was awarded the Ryerson Traveling Fellowship ( $2,500 ) in 1932 , spent three years studying in Paris . Returning to the U.S. with a charming French wife , Painter Binford bought himself " a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting the local Negroes . He also succeeded in arousing the local white population . Commissioned last spring to paint a mural of the burning of Richmond ( 1865 ) for the Saunders Station Post Office , Binford submitted a preliminary sketch nicely calculated to lose him the job . His rough drawing showed a street scene jammed with looters , a mother trying to escape with her baby over prone bodies , a half-naked woman who has torn off her blouse to prevent herself from being scorched , a horseman riding roughshod over all . <P> Said a past president-general of the United Daughters of the Confederacy : " It is one of the most horrible things I 've ever seen . " Said Bishop James Cannon Jr . in the Richmond Times-Dispatch : " The woman 's back and hips are poorly portrayed . " Said Artist Binford : " When and how did this bishop become an authority on the ' backs and hips ' of nude women ? Scat , Bishop ! Get off my scaffold . I am not trying to swarm your pulpit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> But he had just completed another assignment-a 12-ft. - sq. mural for a Negro church at Shiloh , Va . This is one of the rare occasions that a Negro congregation has commissioned a white artist to decorate its church . The mural , unveiled with impressive ceremonies , forms the background to the church 's baptismal pool . For this job Painter Binford was paid in produce . " The local Negroes , " he explains , " who have spent months posing for and watching me paint this mural , inaugurated for my benefit and unknown to me a ' Harvest Home ' in their church . " Now the Binfords have enough preserves , potatoes , beets , corn , chickens to tide them over the winter .
