The Anglo-American correspondents in Moscow were invited to spend a literary evening at VOKS , the Russian society for the promotion of cultural relations with foreign countries . The guests were to meet and hear some of Russia 's foremost correspondents . There would be refreshments and great good-fellowship . <P> After two hour-long speeches in Russian , by Author-Correspondents Konstantin Simonov and Vsevolod Vishnevsky , beaming VOKS officials relinquished the floor to the Anglo-Americans . <P> Up jumped the Philadelphia 's Inquirer 's huge , clarion-voiced Al Kendrick . " I have listened with great interest for two hours to the accounts of our distinguished Soviet colleagues of their life at the Russian war fronts , " he roared . " I should like to take about two minutes of their time to tell how we cover the war in Russia . It may surprise them to learn that . . . the way we cover the great patriotic war of Russia is to sit in our rooms at the Hotel Metropole , read what our Russian colleagues write in the Russian papers , and cable this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get really near the front has been blocked . . . . " <P> There was an embarrassed silence , and then the London News Chronicle 's Paul Winterton got up slowly . " I should like to add to Mr. Kendrick 's remarks , " said he . " Not only is our only source of news about the Russian fronts what we read in the papers from your correspondents , but furthermore we consider that a poor source . . . . We think we could do much better work if we were allowed to go to the front . " <P> The New York Herald Tribune 's veteran , witty Ed Angly fired a barb : " It is possible that the British and American Governments should be grateful to the Russian foreign office for making sure that there will be no casualties among correspondents . . . . " <P> The chairman of VOKS , nervously trying to turn the tide , declared that VOKS was powerless to help the correspondents , and that they Said famed Soviet children 's poet Simeon Marshak : " We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poets ; we can not help you . ... " <P> Taking issue with his colleagues , Reuters ' dry , Scottish John Gibbons declared : " I disagree very sharply with what Mr. Winterton said . I definitely do not feel that the work of Soviet war correspondents has been bad . . . . They have been to Leningrad and Stalingrad . . . . Even if they were the most incompetent nincompoops in the world they would write stirring articles about those things . . . . " <P> The perspiring president of VOKS rapped hesitantly . " We wanted to have you meet some Russian writers , " he said plaintively . " We did not expect this . Perhaps we had better have some refreshments . " <P> The meeting finally broke up . Next morning , most of the Russian correspondents who were there flew to the Yugoslav front to witness the junction of the Russians with Tito . The Anglo-American correspondents , as usual , read the Russian papers .               @ @ @ @ @ @
