Kenneth Wolf , II , expects to have his Ph.D . in chemistry when he is 16 . He will probably get it , too . At Cleveland 's Western Reserve University he leads mathematics and organic chemistry classes full of students years older than he is . His classmates at first kidded him relentlessly , especially about girls , but finally Kennie told them off : " The subject of girls becomes interesting only when the body matures , " he explained . " Mine has n't . It will later . " <P> Kennie was kicked out of grade school because , said the principal , " he disrupted the class , asked too many questions , volunteered too many answers . " Dean C. William Huntley of Western Reserve , a child psychologist , decided that college was the place for the boy . On I.Q. tests Kennie scores about 182 , which means that his " mental age " is about 20 . When he entered college last autumn , his fellow students regarded him as a repulsive little smart aleck . Since then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still enough of a small boy to raid the sugar jar in the chemistry laboratory . But when he was questioned about his chemistry , Kennie answered , " We 're running the oxidation sequence on methanes . Little work with the aldehydes and ketones . " <P> Kennie 's intellectual , Russian-born parents are both leftish lawyers . During World War I , Father Wolf defended Eugene Debs and other " seditious " characters . Little Kennie first amazed his parents at four months-by speaking a whole sentence . Just after his first birthday he tackled a first-grade reader . When he was 22 months old , his mother heard a Liszt air coming from downstairs . She thought Kennie had started the player piano , but she found the baby pounding out the melody himself . <P> Since then music has overshadowed even chemistry as Kennie 's greatest interest . " I suppose there are eleven compositions now I 'd be willing to claim , " he admits . His symphony has never been played : " It 's not necessary . I can hear it . " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Composer Paul Hindemith . Kennie is now the only outsider allowed to attend rehearsals of the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra . <P> Folklore holds that child prodigies usually come to no good . Kennie 's parents and Psychologist Huntley think otherwise . Group studies of bright children ( e.g. , by Stanford 's Lewis M. Terman ) show that they usually turn out healthier , wealthier and wiser than average children .
