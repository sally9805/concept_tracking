Was the Japanese conception of morale , which includes a devoted belief in suicide rather than surrender , beginning to crack ? Some observers who had seen Japanese blow themselves up at Guadalcanal , <P> Buna , Attu or Tarawa thought that perhaps it was . <P> Reports last week from Hollandia , Dutch New Guinea , said that 150 Japanese had surrendered there . Some of them stood beside a road until a U.S. truck gave them a lift to prison camp . <P> It might have been that the Japs at Hollandia were only supply troops ( i.e. , scrubs of the Japanese Army ) and not the fighting garrison General MacArthur expected to find . It was too early to generalize . But obviously not all Japs yearned to die with their colonel ( see p. 20 ) .
