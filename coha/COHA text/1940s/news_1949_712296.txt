txt The " double tenth " - 10th day of the 10th month  --  will acquire fresh significance in China this year , if the Communists proclaim a new national government in Peiping Oct. 10 and if Soviet Russia accords diplomatic recognition on the same date . Anticipation of such a twin development emerge from both Nationalist and Communist China at the close of a week 's fighting that has cost the former the significant east-coast seaport of Foochow , 450 miles northeast of Canton . Hitherto , the fire crackers and other jollifications on Oct. 10 have celebrated the foundation of the present Chinese Republic in 1911 . The founder of this , Dr. Sun Yat-sen , charged the Kuomintang ( Nationalist Party ) with : First , unifying the country , second , teaching it to rule itself by democratic means during a period of " political tutelage " ; and , third , handing over administrative power to the people when they were educated enough to know how to use it . First Aim Achieved After World War I , the first obective was achieved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but China 's own Communists were alienated in 1927 . Thereafter the Kuomintang clung to its power monopoly while fighting a civil war against them . I said it put up an unconvincing facade of power-relinquishment at the first National Assembly  --  staged elaborately at Nanking in the winter of 1946 . It was all supposed to appear most democratic . The Chinese Communists would have no part of it . Neither would the Democratic League , including China 's closest approach to liberals . So the same old reactionary show went on , under the same old dictatorial management of Gen ? Aug. 19 . Ten airplane flights removed all but a few of the personnel to Hong Kong , adjacent British crown colony . The United States Ambassador , James Leighton Stewart , is back in the United States for consultation after difficulty and delay in getting away from Communist-held Nanking , the former Nationalist capital . United States Consul-General Karl Rankin has arranged to commute between Hong Kong and Canton by air until the %current capital falls .

It scarcely will feel repaid if its experience is no happier than that of the people who have stayed behind in Shanghai . , No Comment.7 -- let The Russian Embassy has clung to China 's Nationalist government in most brotherly fashion up to now  --  going ? on the road with it out of Nanking . But , since Washington 's historic White Paper , was produced , the Nationalists have been charging Soviet Russia with sorts of international rnisdemeanors . Soviet Russia has to date made no reply . The official Nationalist written reaction to the Washington White Paper dubbed China 's Communists " thorough Marxists and tools of Moscow . " China 's Communists are not likely to be offended by that in these days . Previously , their boast used to be that they neither received nor needed aid from Russia . Yet Kao Kang , chairman of the new SinoSoviet Friendship Association , declares now : " At a time when China is about to enter the period of new democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the help of world revolutionary forces  --  first and foremost the many-sided help of the Soviet Union . " Militarily Gone Militarily , Canton was virtually in the Communists ' bag by Aug. 19 . News of the fall of Tayu , 170 miles away on the Yan River road , expedited the tempo of evacuation from the temporary capital . Communist Gen. Chen Yi 's Communist armies , fresh from the capture of Foochow , were fewer than 300 miles away , heading southwest from above Amoy . At the same time , Communist spearheads were reportedly thrusting toward Lanchow in the northwest . This is the center of Chinese road and air communications with Soviet Russia and Central Asia generally . It is only about 150 miles from the Tibetan border . Just recently the Communists have captured several islands which served as bases for Nationalist sea blockading forces , used against mainland ports . Though the war goes thus badly against them the Nationalists insist they will fight on from Chungking and the island of Formosa . So the end is not yet in sight .
