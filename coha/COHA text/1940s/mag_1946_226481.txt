When Diego Rivera went home from Paris in 1921 , he saw his native Mexico more appreciatively . Particularly he cast a fresh eye on a primitive art that no one else seemed to care about . He journeyed into the Pacific Coast provinces west of Mexico City , and began picking up pieces of precious art for about a peso apiece . <P> Word got around among the Indians of the region that there was a wealthy painter willing to pay money for the oddities they plowed up in the fields or found in digging ditches . A steady stream of natives came to his door , bearing grotesque clay figures of humans and animals , whistles , pipes , beads . The stuff gradually overflowed the two houses Rivera owns . <P> Mexico 's National Museum showed little interest in these oddments . The Museum was too busy spending money on such academic sure things as the arts of the Mayas , the Mixtecs and the Aztecs . <P> Six months ago , Salvador Toscano , who is an official of Mexico 's Palacio de Bellas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airing . When art historians got busy on the collection they found that what they had long called Tarascan art , and knew almost nothing about , was actually a collection of several cultures in the states of Michoacan , Jalisco , Colima and Nayarit . A German-born ethnologist , Dr. Paul Kirchhoff , was called in to lend a hand . He found that Rivera had one of the greatest treasuries of the day . <P> Last week Senor Toscano 's exhibit opened in Mexico City ; 90% of it was from Rivera 's collection . The show was front-page news in Mexico City , which was as unusual as an art show making Page One in New York City . <P> The Idea Was Fun : Visitors to the gallery found themselves in a world as whimsically engaging as first-rate Disney . The pre-Columbian art of the Indians of Western Mexico had a freshness of its own ; none of the stern beauty of Aztec forms or the glum formality of Mayan relics . When the Indians were not laughing at themselves , they were good-naturedly caricaturing someone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humps ; in erotic figures phallus outweighed man . <P> Almost all the sculpture was in clay , uninhibited , unschooled , and surprisingly modern-looking . One figure , which looked like one of Disney 's Seven Dwarfs , stood bent-kneed , bat in hand , as if timidly waiting for the next pitch . Another was a subtle , tender caricature of a man 's face with the head and body of a fat , droll dog . <P> The show 's real breathtaker was an entire Indian village peopled with small figures from three to five inches high . Whatever the action-women nursing children , acrobats tumbling , people dancing , others just loafing-everybody seemed to be having a lot of fun .
