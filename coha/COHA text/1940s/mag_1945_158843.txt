Less than two months after the aircraft carrier Franklin had been hit off Kyushu by two Japanese bombs and turned into a floating inferno ( TIME , May 28 ) , the same fate befell her elder , more experienced sister , the Bunker Hill . The circumstances were astonishingly similar : the ship was at flight quarters ( launching planes ) . The enemy aircraft dived through the Bunker Hill 's own combat air patrol so suddenly that they could not be splashed by U.S. fighters . <P> A Zeke ( old-type Zero ) dropped a delayed-action bomb which penetrated the Bunker Hill 's flight deck , went out through the ship 's side and burst over the water . But the Zeke itself crashed on the after half of the carrier 's deck , crowded with 34 loaded planes , ready to go . That kindled a raging fire . Then a Judy ( dive bomber ) dropped a 500-pounder through the flight deck , and crashed into the base of the island structure . The Bunker Hill 's fight for life was on . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pete " ) Mitscher , boss of the whole vast Task Force 58 , happened to be away from his usual perch on a high chair on the flag bridge , where some officers and men of his staff were killed . Two other places where Mitscher might have been were hit - an office and his living quarters , where all his clothing except " the uniform he was wearing was destroyed . Soon Mitscher had to transfer by boatswain 's chair to the destroyer English , which flew his three-starred flag with unaccustomed pride . Mitscher soon went to another carrier . <P> Carrier 's Escape . The Bunker Hill 's fight for survival lasted through many agonizing hours . A huge pillar of smoke billowed from the after half of the ship , where blazing gasoline and oil sloshed around . Crewmen manned hoses in the face of flames which scorched them to the limit of endurance . Part of the Marine detachment stayed in an ovenlike compartment , throwing bombs and rockets overboard . Tons of water , covered with burning gas and oil , were spilled off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by the navigator , Commander Charles J. Odend'hal Jr . <P> When the explosions ended and the fires were out , the chaplains led volunteers in a search for the dead . Next day , 352 men who had died to save their ship were committed to the sea ; in all , 393 were killed or missing , 264 wounded . <P> The Bunker Hill had won her Navy nickname of " Holiday Inn " because her career started with holiday strikes ( Armistice Day , Christmas and New Year 's ) against New Britain and New Ireland , a year and a half ago . Last week Holiday Inn , closed for alterations at Puget Sound Navy Yard , ranked next to the Franklin as the most cruelly ravaged U.S. ship ever to reach port under her own power .
