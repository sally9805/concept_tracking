Round No. 3 had begun . U.S. labor was again asking U.S. industry for higher wages . Boosts ranging from 8 to 12 an hour had already been won by three middle-sized C.I.O. unions-the Amalgamated Clothing Workers , the Textile Workers and Harry Bridges ' longshoremen . These gains came peaceably . <P> But last week Round No. 3 produced its first crisis . It arose out of a demand by three A.F.L. unions , representing some 50,000 Western Union employees , for a 15-an-hour hike . Western Union offered to give from a penny to a nickel more per hour to 9,029 workers , nothing to the rest . The unions branded the offer " insulting , " called a strike for this week . <P> After intervention by the new Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service , set up under the Taft-Hartley Act , the strike was called off-for sixty days at least . <P> But for U.S. industry , which for months has been free of major strikes , this was a disturbing symptom of trouble to come . Even more disturbing was the news that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his miners a $1,200-a-year pension at 60 ( after 20 years of service ) . If the operators failed to accede to this demand by Jan 1 , Lewis would have an opportunity to call a strike in March . <P> By spring , Round No. 3 would be going full blast . The C.I.O. 's two giants , the steelworkers and the autoworkers , would both go to bat on new contracts in April . The steelworkers ' Phil Murray planned to drive hard for an annual wage . The autoworkers ' Walter Reuther wanted a price roll-back , * but did not expect to get it . In Washington last week , Reuther said : " What we 're after is not dollars but purchasing power . If industry and Congress keep on failing to reduce prices , we will fight on the only front open to us-wages .
