txt The top leaders of the American Communist party served notice yesterday that they would pursue a policy intended to defeat United States aims if this nation were involved in a war they considered " unjust , aggressive , imperialist . " Declaring that United States military preparedness and the North Atlantic defense pact raised a real threat of war embroiling France and Italy in military operations against the Soviet Union , the American Communist leaders said they would oppose such a war and cooperate to defeat its aims and bring it to a speedy conclusion . The statement setting out this policy was signed by William Z. Foster , national chairman of the party/ and Eugene Dennis , general secretary . It followed similar declarations by the top Communist leaders of France , Italy , Germany and Great Britain . Mr. Foster and Mr. Dennis said : " If , despite the efforts of peace forces of America and the world , Wall Street should succeed in plunging the world into war , we would oppose it as an unjust , aggressive , imperialist war , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deepest interests of the American people and all humanity . " Even as Lincoln , while a Congressman , opposed the unjust , annexationist Mexican War and demanded its termination , so would we Communists cooperate with all democratic forces to defeat the predatory war aims of American imperialism and bring such a war to- a speedy conclusion on the basis of a democratic peace . " The flurry of declarations from the heads of the Communist parties began with that of Maurice Thorez of France in an address on Feb. 22 before a meeting of his party . He said : " If the common efforts of the freedom-loving French do not succeed in bringing our country back into the camp of democracy and peace , if later our country should // be dragged against its will into a war against the Soviet Union and if the Soviet . Army , defending the cause of freedom and of socialism , should be brought to pursue the aggressors onto our , soil , could the workers and people of France have any other attitude toward the Soviet Army than has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Holds Discussion Absurd Palmiro Togliatti of Italy commented on this in a statement to a newspaper on Feb. 26 . He said he considered it " absurd " to discuss a war between the Soviet Union and Italy , but when asked what the attitude would be if the Soviet Army were to pursue an " aggressor " on Italian territory , he said : " I think that in this case the Italian people can not but condemn all aggressions and would have the evident duty of helping the Soviet Army in the most effective way possible to give the aggressor the lesson he deserves , letting the whole world ? know immediately that the Italian people  --  or at least the great majority of their active and fighting part  --  think this way will help without a doubt to check aggressors and preserve peace . " Harry Pollitt of Great Britain , general secretary of the Communist party , told party leaders on Feb. 27 that British Communists would try to stop any " imperialist aggressive war against the U.S.S.R. " He said : " If provocateurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an imperialist aggressive war against the U.S.S.R. , we will reply in the same way as Ernest Bevin in 1920 ? organize strikes and councils of action to prevent that war from being carried through . " The statement of Mr. Foster and Mr. Dennis was in the same vein as ** Pollitt 's , but less specific . Mr. Dennis and the other members of the national committee of thb American Communist party are on trial in Federal Court here on charges of conspiracy to organiza the party to advocate tie overthrow of Government by force , and violence . Issued From Headquarters The statement was issued from the national committee 's headquarters on the ninth floor of 35 East Twelfth Street in response to ' requests from two newspapers and ' a news service for comment on the Thorez - Togliatti statements . A spokesman handed out mimeo-1 graphed copies , explaining that it had been written by Mr. Foster and Mr. Dennis in collaboration . Mr. Dennis , according to the spokesman , was in his office on the some floor . Mr. Foster , who is ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his home on Walton Avenue , the Bronx , and exchange ? drafts with Mr. Dennis . Asked if the succession of declarations did . not indicate that the leaders had been directed to issue them by " Moscow , " the spokesman said , " No , that 's nonsense . " After the reporters had read the statement , a stenographer took down their questions . They fallow : " What means would the Communists in this country take to oppose this so-called imperialist war that this country would be engaged in ? " " If this country were engaged in a war you considered unjust , aggressive and imperialist , would you promulgate or support a general strike ? " " By ' all democratic forces ' do you mean Russia snecifically ? " " If in- such a war the United States should be invaded , would the Communist party undertake to support the forces of the invading armies , namely , the Soviet armies ? " " In such an event ( let us assume the war is considered unjust and imperialist ) would you attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production ? " " Will the Communist party in this country oppose the military forces of this country- if it is engaged in a war with Russia ? " The stenographer took the questions in to Mr. Dennis . Shortly thereafter the spokesman issued the following note : " Mr. Dennis was tied up in a conference on the coming trial of the eleven Communist leaders scheduled to open next Monday at Federal Court . Shown a series of written questions , he glanced at them and stated that he would seek to answer them during the course of the trial . " One of the newspapers referred to in the statement was THE NEW YORK TIMES . Last Monday the city desk of TH- , TIMES wrote Mr. Foster , asking him to reply to a question posed in an editorial in this newspaper last Sunday . It read : " ' What would . be the attitude of American Communists if Soviet Russia should charge Canada with aggression , land an army there and pursue Canadian forces across the border of the United States ; would American Communists have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , of aiding in the most efficient way th , Soviet Army ? ' " Mr. Foster and Mr. Dennis did not reply directly to this question but they indicted in the statement that they had read it by quoting a phrase from the next sentence in the editorial : " The event is we hope , wildly improbablye , but we have a right to know the answer . " Although the statement did not go into specific policies as had Mr. Pollitt 's the recent history of the , American Communist party is a ' clue to what the American leaders had in mind . Policy Was Changed Before the Stalin-Hitler Pact was signed in Moscow on Aug. 24 , 1939 , the Communists were ardent , supporters of an anti-fascist front and campaigners for collective security . ? On the signing of the pact they did a flip-flop overnight , opposed recruiting and conscription with the slogan , " The Yanks Are Not Coming . " They denounced the war between Germany and England as " the imperialists ' war , " and opposed aid to Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gun , not a man . " Campaigning for American neutrality , they denounced Franklin D. Roosevelt , then President , as a " warmonger , " accused " Wall Street " of fomenting war and formed innocents ' fronts like the American League for Peace and Democracy , the American Youth Cangress and other groups to urge isolation . - When campaigning was unavailing , the Communists turned to direct action . They fomented strikes in the war plants through which this country was rearming , among them the North American Aviation , the Vultee Aircraft and the Allis-Chalmers plants . In the latter plant especially the strikes , were pressed with increasing violence and lawlessness . They colonized the maritime unions and fostered unrest in its personnel . But when the Soviet Union was invaded on June 5 , 1940 , they did another flip-flop . Mr. Roosevelt became " our superb leader , " the war a " people 's war of national liberation " and a " holy cause " and the slogan of the day , " Fight , America , fight ! " Strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just or how unrelated to the war effort ; war production was spurred and the draft pressed , many Communists themselves entering the armed forces . Once the war was over , Communists among the troops started a concerted campaign , " Bring the boys back home . " In the last paragraph of the statement the Communist leaders referred to a peace drive they are about to . start . This is parallel to a world peace drive being prepared by the Soviet Information Bureau , an agency under the Soviet Council ' of Ministers . The American effort will include well-publicized conferences of intellectuals , of women and of youth . In addition , Henry A. Wallace , who collaborates with the Communists in the Progressi-'e party , has invited sympathetic leaders throughout the world to join him in " barnstorming " .. for " peace " in the spring . Pietro Nenni , Italian deputy who collaborates with the Communists ; Pierre Cot , former French Cabinet Minister , and Konni Zillacus , left-wing member of the British Parliament , accepted .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
