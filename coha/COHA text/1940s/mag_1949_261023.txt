Like most retailers , the Grand Leader Store of South Bend , Ind . had been bucking a deep depression in appliance sales . One week in July it sold just six refrigerators . But the following week it sold 247 . <P> The difference was a little black box with a face like a parking meter 's and a slot like a piggy bank 's . Called the Meter-Matic , it is similar to pay-as-you-go meters used during the depression , then discarded when money began growing on trees again . The gadget is fastened atop the refrigerator and the purchaser drops in a quarter a day ( or more , depending on the installment conditions ) ; if he fails to drop the coin in the slot , the electric current shuts off . <P> Chicago 's International Register Co. sells the hungry little gadget to retailers for $6.95 . By last week , only a month after going on the market , the Meter-Matic was on some 5,000 refrigerators . In one of its zones , Nash-Kelvinator began July with the largest inventory it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The General Furniture Co. , in Chicago 's slummy South Side , sold more than 2,000 refrigerators and other appliances in two weeks , almost all on the meter plan . <P> Retailers using the Meter-Matic plug the slogan : " No money down , as little as 25 a day ! " Merchants who have attached meters to stoves , washers and television sets have run into a snag : customers tend to feed the meter only when the appliance is in use . But shrewd retailers have gotten around that by attaching the meter to the refrigerator , no matter which appliance is bought . Refrigerators are different : they have to keep going .
