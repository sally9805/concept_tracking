TIME 'S Correspondent Walter Graebner , after a trip up the Volga into Russia , filed the following dispatch : <P> We have met Red airmen , and they are good . At Stalingrad our boat took aboard 100 or so pilots and mechanics who had just been in action at Voronezh . They were members of a famous Stormovik group commanded by Colonel Boris Rivenshstein , one of the Soviet Union 's greatest airmen . <P> Rivenshstein visited our cabin to practice his English and play phonograph records . He is 32 , handsome and blue-eyed . He has been flying since he was 17 and has a handshake like Joe Louis ' . Stalin has received him three times . His group , fighting almost continuously on the Moscow , Kalinin , Orel and Voronezh fronts , has shot down about 200 German planes , and in six attacks recently destroyed 167 planes on the ground . The group has lost 20 Russian planes and 13 pilots . " Twenty for one is a good enough average , " Boris says with smiling eyes and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more remarkable because the principal business of Stormoviks is not to shoot down Nazis . The Stormoviks are ground-strafers . With their two cannon and two machine guns , they swoop down to ten or 15 meters , then blast away at tanks , motorized vehicles , grounded planes and troops . One of our visitors was a young lieutenant who had the tail of his Stormovik shot away when he was hardly ten meters ( 32 ft. ) off the ground . Nevertheless he landed well inside the Russian lines , with his hip and both sides of his face injured , and walked back to his camp . He arrived six days after the crash . <P> Boris and his boys say that the Germans are not a patch on what they were in 1941 . Their bombing was pretty bad a year ago , but it is terrible now , and each time they come over they come higher than last time. * <P> Boris 's men , and nearly every other soldier we have met , had one question uppermost in mind about England and America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the feeling in your country about the second front ? " <P> With no malice whatever , the soldiers let us know that the Russians have been counting on the establishment of a second front . They all said , in one way or another : " If England and America hit Germany from the west , she would collapse this year . " <P> * The high morale of Colonel Rivenshstein 's group unfortunately does not alter the fact , attested by Moscow communiques and dispatches , that the German air force has had decisive numerical superiority on the southern front . A local exception to this rule was the Voronezh sector. - ED.
