SCOTT-KING 'S MODERN EUROPE ( 89 pp. ) - Evelyn Waugh-Little , Brown ( $2 ) . <P> This short novel from Evelyn Waugh ( published in Britain in 1947* ) reads like a malicious parody of his good ones . It is the story of a middle-aged teacher of the classics who happens to become ( through some " blood-brotherhood in dimness " ) the greatest living authority on an obscure 17th Century Central European poet named Bellorius . On the Bellorius Tercentenary , Scott-King is invited to Simona , a city in Neutralia , for the celebration . <P> The Disguised Professor . Neutralia itself ( which , Waugh cautiously explains , represents no existing state ) has suffered from " dynastic wars , foreign invasion , disputed successions , revolting colonies , endemic syphilis , impoverished soil , masonic intrigues , revolutions , restorations , cabals , juntas , pronunciamentos , liberations , constitutions , coups d ' tat , dictatorships , assassinations , agrarian reforms , popular elections , foreign intervention , repudiation of loans , inflations of currency , trade unions , massacres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a totalitarian republic whose dictator is popular because he kept it out of World War II <P> The Bellorius Celebration takes place simultaneously with a religious pilgrimage , a gathering of stamp collectors and ; congress of 500 women athletes . Scott-King 's companions include a battered newspaperwoman , a law professor substituting for someone else , a Swiss scholar who wanders into the hills and is murdered by partisans . Since the British government has no official knowledge og Scott-King 's presence in the country , his is compelled to leave by the underground disguised as a nun , and is at length deposited at a small Mediterranean port among various royalists , anarchists , Ptainists , terrorists , ex-Gestapo men , Italian airmen , Turkish prostitutes , Hungarian ballet dancers and Portuguese Trotskyites . He winds up eventually at a Jewish Illicit Immigrants ' camp in Palestine where one of his former students recognizes him and establishes his identity . <P> The Tired Master . Even in the distressed state and anything-that-goes philosophy of U.S. book publishing , Scott-King 's Modern Europe ( which also appeared in Cosmopolitan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short story expanded just enough for book form . The studied anticlimaxes and the resolute deflation of the funny scenes give it a grisly monotony ; the book suggests a tired master who seems to be trying to see how far he can go in revealing his contempt for his large and profitable audience . Out of it , however , Scott-King emerges as one of Waugh 's rarer characters . <P> The inconsequence of his journey does not in the least detract from the impression ( rather reluctantly given ) that he is , after all , the embodiment of some old English virtues : heroic without knowing that he is , eloquently monosyllabic , honest , scrupulous , sane , reserved , decent . He deserves more room than he gets . <P> * And written between Brides head Revisited ( TIME , Jan. 7 , 1946 ) and The Loved One ( TIME , July 12 ) .
