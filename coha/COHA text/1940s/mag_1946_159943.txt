In the huge cream &; green arena of Milwaukee 's auditorium a voice shouted : " I want to call a spade a spade and tell this convention I am a Communist . " He was a delegate to the meeting of the C.I.O. 's United Electrical , Radio and Machine Workers . As photographers rushed for their cameras , press-shy President Albert Fitzgerald grabbed for his microphone : " You boys behave . These vultures are about to take pictures . " <P> Actually , most of the 3,500 delegates sat quietly patient through the vicious wranglings of right-and left-wing leaders . Everyone knew that the C.I.O. 's biggest Communist-dominated union was going to stay dominated . <P> Even slim Jim Carey , onetime U.E. president and now secretary-treasurer of the C.I.O. , knew that his fight to oust the Communist-line triumvirate could never amount to more than a test of strength for future battles . On the second day Carey made his bid : a resolution to bar Communists from union office . It never came to a vote . By a landslide majority of 2,827 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every member all rights and privileges . . . including the right to hold any position . . . regardless of craft , age , sex , nationality , race , creed or political belief . " <P> Next day , by just about the same ratio , they voted back into office U.E. 's Big Three : waspish Albert Fitzgerald , no Red himself , as U.E. 's figurehead president ; Communist-wired James J. Matles and Julius Emspak , U.E. 's real bosses , as top organizer and secretary-treasurer . <P> As the smoothly disciplined convention rolled to a close , delegates rose to their feet for a minute of silence in honor of two departed friends of labor . For Sidney Hillman the minute shrank unaccountably to 20 seconds , as clocked by newsmen . For Franklin D. Roosevelt it was extended to 65 by sharp-eyed , sharp-tongued President Fitzgerald . He growled afterwards to press-table timekeepers : " Was that one long enough for you , you bastards ? " <P> The A.F.L. last week had its own comments on the issue of Communism-in-labor : <P> Cautious A.F.L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a straight-talking guide to Communist doubletalk . Sample : " They are willing to promise you the moon to convert you into tools and catspaws . . . . The Communists do not want to see the anti-poll tax bill and the fair employment bill adopted . By placing themselves in the forefront of these measures , they knew they were helping to defeat them . " <P> In Chicago , the A.F.L. 's Upholsterers ' International Union gleefully announced the acquisition of 5,000 disgruntled , anti-Communist members of the C.I.O. 's Red-upholstered United Furniture Workers .
