Last week a big worm turned in Wall Street . Underwriters Morgan Stanley &; Co. haled SEC into court , demanded that it reverse its Dayton Power decision and return $90,844 in underwriting fees . <P> This particular phase of Wall Street 's long fray with SEC started in February 1940 , when Morgan Stanley agreed to let SEC " impound " the fees due them on a Dayton Power Co. bond issue , until SEC made sure the bankers were no " affiliate " of the utility . At the time , this seemed like a mere formality to Morgan Stanley ; they certainly were not affiliated with Dayton Power , the money was just as good as theirs . But it was n't . Last April ( TIME , April 14 ) SEC ( in what Morgan Stanley termed a " fantasy " ) declared Morgan Stanley was a Dayton Power affiliate , via Columbia Gas &; Electric , <P> United Corp . and J. P. Morgan . Therefore , said SEC , there was no " arm's-length bargaining " on the bond sale . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got nothing . <P> Whatever the court decides , one thing is plain : there is some fight in Wall Street yet-or at least in Morgan Stanley .
