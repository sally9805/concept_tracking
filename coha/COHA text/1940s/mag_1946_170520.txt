From his office window last week , Harry Zinder , chief of TIME-LIFE International 's Cairo bureau , could see the flocks of turkeys , geese and fat-tailed sheep , the herds of goats and gamoose ( water buffalo ) moving through the cluttered streets to the holiday markets . Christmas was at hand , and Zinder , as usual , was finding it a time of rejoicing and confusion . <P> <P> Arab members of his bureau had already celebrated Courban Bairam , their holy festival ; the Copts and Orthodox adherents would not celebrate theirs until Jan. 7 . From past experience Zinder knew that by some miracle of cookery the turkey would come out right . The cook , who abhorred pots , would beat together a pair of Shell gasoline tins and roast the big bird over " one of those vertical blow torches known as Primus stoves . " Nevertheless , there would be open house Christmas Day at the Zinder 's home on the Nile , and the weather promised to be typical for Egypt in December : clear , warm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be much the same this week with all of TIME Inc. ' s 294 members overseas . And for most of those who had spent the bleak Christmases of the war years abroad , there was a special difference this year : their wives and children were with them . <P> From Vienna , John Walker reported proudly that he had managed to secure a " fine little electric train " for his young son , Michael . The Walkers had a Christmas tree and hoped to festoon it with popcorn strings-if they could find some popcorn . <P> Times were hard in Nanking , but the Fred Gruins had a fat goose ( no turkeys available ) and Fred Jr. , aged five , was all set to chop down a little evergreen growing inside the bamboo fence of the Gruin 's ten-mow ( 3 ? - acre ) " estate . " In Shanghai , Bureau Chief William Gray , his wife " Freddie , " and their three children , looked forward to being in their new house on Columbia Road . Said Gray : " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the mao erh to tzu ( cat 's ears or thorn of holly ) and startle passing ricksha boys with God Rest Ye Merry , Gentlemen . " <P> <P> Christmas trees were sparse in London ( those with a diameter of more than 2 inches rated as timber and required a special license from the timber control authorities ) , and it took considerable conniving to lure a plum pudding out of the grocer , but the children 's toy supply had improved . For English members of the bureau like June Rose , the season offered an additional prospect : " The whole family is finally demobilized , and we 'll sit around the fire together in civilian clothes for the first time since 1939 . " <P> In Paris , bureaumen had thoughtfully tucked away such choice items as truffles , chestnuts and chocolates , and William Chapman 's two small sons , Benny and Johnnie , eagerly awaited the appearance of their new Santa , Pre Noel . In Buenos Aires , Christmas was certain to be one of the hottest days of summer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day by going swimming . It was just as certain to be a white Christmas in Moscow , where Bureau Chief Craig Thompson and his wife were pointing for a Christmas Eve party at Spasso House , home of U.S. Ambassador and Mrs. Walter Bedell Smith .
