Sirs : <P> The title of your column The Presidency , at least insofar as the May 10 issue is concerned , is a misnomer . Why not make it " Pan the President ? " The problems which necessarily plague the leader of a great democracy in wartime you term a " mess . " Then , from out of the depths of your infallible wisdom , you conclude- " The mess was , in the last analysis , of his own making . " . . . <P> SAM HOUSTON <P> Hollywood , Calif . <P> &gt; Neither TIME nor Franklin Roosevelt is infallible ( see below ) . - ED . <P> Sirs : <P> . . . Your utter hate of F.D.R. and his Administration and , essentially , for all his works-is splattered venomously over most of the first pages of the May 10 issue . . . . <P> PRIVATE STANLEY WELLS <P> Wm . Northern Army Air Field , Tenn . <P> Sirs : <P> " Over the White House the air was black with chickens coming home to roost . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subtle sarcasm . . . . <P> PATRICIA M. ELLIS <P> San Francisco <P> Sirs : <P> ... I think you do a public service in your candid presentation of the Presidency v. Lewis , which is the type of balanced presentation of facts that is too little available elsewhere . <P> HUGH R. MACMICHAEL <P> New York City <P> Sirs : <P> . . . Printing stuff like that about John Lewis . What are you trying to do ? Start another civil war at a time when every effort of mind and body should be turned to the task of winning this war and planning for the future ? . . . <P> ERNEST A. LINCOLN JR . <P> Miami <P> Sirs : <P> . . . Your analysis of the coal dispute between the President and Lewis is so distorted , so bitter toward the President , so relatively charitable toward Lewis , that anyone not acquainted with TIME 's habitual method of sensational and " out on a limb " journalistic style would actually believe you favored Lewis over the President . . . . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The write-up . . . on the coal strike was grand . It places the blame where it belongs - on the Administration . . . . <P> PRIVATE HOWARD BORNET <P> Fresno , Calif . <P> Sirs : <P> Regardless of what TIME says , President Roosevelt is doing a splendid , bang-up job of leading this country in the most crucial period of American history . . . . <P> A. A. DOMONT <P> Muskegon , Mich . <P> Sirs : <P> . . . If others feel as I do they must wonder at your mild-mannered treatment of Mr. Roosevelt . . . . <P> You are quick enough to lay into Mr. Lewis ( and I , too , agree ) , but why kiss F.D.R. by utterly diffident reporting . . . ? <P> C. C. DEWEY <P> Wyndmoor , Pa . <P> Sirs : <P> If the opinions and reactions of several hundred soldiers at Fort Jackson , making up a good cross section of our fighting men , are at all worth considering , then you 're not just " all wet " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thwarted and outmaneuvered the head of 135,000,000 people . " . . . <P> After all is said &; done , what American would want to think of our leader as a " Superman " . . . ? We 'll be content to leave those attributes to comic strips and Der Fhrer . . . . Our President is a man , a mere mortal , whose " chickens come home to roost . " We do n't expect him to be infallible . . . .
