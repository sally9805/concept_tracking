In backward U.S. country districts last week ( and not-so-backward ones , too ) , " water witches " paced solemnly , holding forked twigs of peachwood , hazel , willow or witch-hazel , the butts pointed upward . Some muttered incantations ; some prayed ; some were intensely silent . At last the twig swung downward or spun around wildly . <P> On that spot , according to the ancient art of " divining , " " dowsing " or " water-witching , " the rural landowner should sink his well . There he could seek and certainly find water . <P> Some dowsers were undoubtedly sincere , accepting no fee and believing themselves to be agents of an unknown natural law or supernatural force . Others were small-time swindlers . Their hoary profession survived because , in the many parts of the U.S. level enough for farming , underground water was easy to find , at least in spring . But honest or crooked , the U.S. Geological Survey was against dowsers . <P> It had put together a fascinating booklet on the subject ( Water-supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dowsers , beginning with Moses , who lifted up his hand , and with his rod he smote the rock twice : and the water came out abundantly ( Numbers 20 : 11 ) . Few modern dowsers hoped to equal Moses , but some of them offered prizes , such as oilfields or mineral deposits , which Moses and his nomads never coveted . <P> " Divining " with rods or twigs or arrows goes back to earliest history . But " dowsing " in its modern form , using the forked stick , seems to have started in 16th-Century Germany . Even educated men like Melanchthon believed that the twigs of trees above mineral veins drooped downward , attracted by the deposit below . Miners in the Harz Mountains put this principle to hopeful use , searching for minerals with forked , ore-seeking twigs . <P> The practice spread to England when German miners were imported to Cornwall during the reign of good Queen Bess . Some religious authorities condemned it as fraud or dealing with the devil . Others gave it clerical approval . From England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going strong , with most of the emphasis on water-finding . Modern , up-to-date dowsers often abandon the hallowed forked stick for an elaborate gadget pretending to use some scientific phenomenon , such as radioactivity or radar . That is dowsing just the same . <P> One mile across Washington , the Department of Agriculture was battling another perennial set of rural superstitions . Examples : <P> In the South , farmers were still planting root crops in the dark of the moon , and above-the-ground crops when the moon was full . This practice , probably as old as agriculture , was supposed to steer the plants ' efforts in the right direction . Elsewhere , farmers still believed that a silver coin in the churn would make butter come faster ; that a storm was brewing when pigs ran around with sticks in their mouths , or when cats and rats played together after sundown.
