It had been 30 years . Driving through the jack-pine country of northern Wisconsin on his calls , Doc MacKinnon reflected : it had seemed much shorter than that . In the long country-doctor days and broken nights of George Elliott MacKinnon , now 60 , he had brought hundreds - thousands- of children into life . Many a Finnish logger had come to his office in little ( pop . 452 ) Prentice , Wis. to be patched up after a knife fight . There had been fevers , croups , contagions , the flu epidemic of 1919 , when Doc was out on the drifted roads for eight subzero days &; nights , . with a steaming horse pulling his sleigh and a fresh animal trotting behind . On his lonely rides Doc had worn out the sleigh , a buggy , a snowmobile , a Chewy , a Star and 15 Fords . <P> Now what had come over Prentice , Doc wondered ? On the street , last week , people kept telling him , " Please do n't have any babies on Thursday . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all cleaned up . The next morning ( after getting up at 5 to deliver baby No. 2,891 ) he discovered why : it was " MacKinnon Day " in Prentice . <P> Parade on Main Street . By early forenoon 2,500 people had crowded into town and Doc MacKinnon was standing in a reviewing stand watching 450 of his " babies " march past , with stork-decorated floats , and a band . After that he was presented with a shiny 1946 Ford , and led before a microphone . <P> " I knew you were about to blackmail me someway , " he said , " but I did n't know just how . " Then his voice choked up and that was the end of his speech . <P> But MacKinnon Day was just beginning . The Lutheran Ladies ' Aid gave a smrgsbord . The Monday Study Club gave a reception . School was closed and children gathered at the Village Hall , presented the Doc with a 21-jewel Hamilton watch and sang : <P> " . . . of his skill we love to tell ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night there was a Community Club dinner in the Lutheran Church . Just as it ended Doc got an emergency call ; Earl Ames over in Ogema asked him to come right away . Everybody in town went to the town hall for the evening program , anyhow . The school principal made a talk . Mrs. Tyler of Tomasawaka was introduced as the " Songbird of the North " and sang If I Had My Way . The crowd sang too . They were still there at 11 o'clock when Doc got back to report : " The mother nearly died , the baby nearly died , I nearly died , but we all lived . The baby was blue and I had to dip him in hot and cold water . " <P> While everyone applauded , Doc was handed a check for $1,300 drawn on the State Bank of Phillips . Some people thought he looked a little tired when the gathering broke up . But he was up early again , next morning . As usual , he had plenty of calls to make .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
