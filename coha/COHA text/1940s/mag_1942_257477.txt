Almost half of the nation 's 180,000 doctors had to register in the draft this week , and many a civilian worried about being left doctorless . In large cities , at least , he need not worry . <P> Only half the registered doctors are expected to pass their physical tests or be free of dependents ; besides , the Army &; Navy , which have over 13,000 doctors already , will take only about 18,000 more this year . According to Colonel Samuel Joseph Kopetzky , medical head of Selective Service in New York City , the doctors who are left would probably be sufficient to fill the needs of any community . <P> The main problem of civilian medicine , said Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur , head of the American Medical Association 's Council on Medical Education and Hospitals , is to save the doctor 's time . Henceforth trained physicians will have to spend most of their time in their offices , will make only urgent house calls ; chronic and convalescent patients will have to be moved out of hospitals to make room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take over simple medical tasks . <P> To keep up the yearly output of 6,000 new doctors , the Army will now defer from the draft first-and second-year medical students . Premedical students who do good work will also be allowed to continue their studies . All deferred students will be given reserve commissions in the Army Medical Administration Corps . <P> Yet , in spite of these assurances , many parts of the country are worried about their medical future . Examples : <P> Several counties of Kansas have only one doctor left . The Kansas Medical Association will probably ask retired doctors to take up practice again . <P> In prosperous Westchester County , N.Y. , 50 of the 950 physicians are already commissioned ; by the end of the year as many as 225 may be in uniform . <P> In the last few weeks the Army &; Navy have called out many Base Hospital Units which were organized by doctors &; nurses in general hospitals . Many of these hospital units were founded during World War I. These units will serve in general military hospitals , similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
