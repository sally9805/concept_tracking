The best newspaper in the U.S. rarely uses up space to talk about itself . Recently the New York Times took two-thirds of a column to report how the American press is spending over $50 million on plant expansion . But the Times spared only two lines to tell about the biggest project of all , its own $6,000,000 rebuilding job . <P> By late next fall , when the hammers are stilled and the plaster dust settled , Manhattan 's sedate Times will be settled in one of the fanciest quarters in the business . An air-conditioned building with pastel walls , glass-brick partitions and functional furniture , it has cozy bedroom suites for executives , playrooms and dining rooms for all 3,300 staffers and a city room so vast that the city editor has to use a microphone to page his far-flung reporters . <P> Meet the People . The Times no longer lives on Times Square ( but still flashes its headlines to crowds there , from a traveling sign that girdles its old wedge-shaped building ) . Its present home is half a block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annex that breaks through to 44th . This week it will open a fancy information center , where readers may pore over bound volumes and Microfilm editions of the Times that go back to 1851 . <P> The rest of the floor , barred from the public 's view , is all but finished . It is filled with the block-long city room , where Managing Editor Edwin L. James 's staff nightly assembles all the news that 's fit to print . Executives sit at the south end , a full block away from some of their reporters . Turner Catledge , assistant to James , was given a pair of opera glasses by his staff to survey the farthest reaches of the room . Near by sits City Editor David Joseph , a shy , balding , quiet-spoken bachelor of 61 . His public-address system is one-way ; staffers who want to talk back have to hike over to his desk . <P> Room with Bath . City Editor Joseph , who probably does less editing than any city editor in the business , has no need for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Publisher Arthur Hays Sulzberger , General Manager Julius Ochs Adler , Editor Charles Merz , Sunday Editor Lester Markel , Columnist Anne O'Hare McCormick and Managing Editor James , in case they are stuck at the paper all night . Joseph takes his leave of his morning-paper staff by 6 p.m . He and his assistants assign the Times 's 150 reporters to stories , but the editing is done by copyreaders , which helps explain why the Times sometimes reads as if nobody edited it at all . <P> As a documentary newspaper , the Times prints more news ( 165 to 185 columns a night ) than any other paper ; it is one daily where the editors , not the admen , determine the size of the paper each day . " We get a million words a day in here , " said a Times executive . " Not counting what is duplicated , we have around 600 columns of news to trim down . The editing has to be for length and for accuracy ; we ca n't stop to rewrite many stories . " Readability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to solve . "
