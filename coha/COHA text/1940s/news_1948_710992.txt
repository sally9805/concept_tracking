txt As the fuel oil crisis created by the shortage of transportation and by the repeated , storms worsened lyesterday , rumors grew that a black market in fuel oil had developed . The Board of Transportation admitted that it had been the first victim of " gouging . " William Reid , chairman of the board , confirmed a report in The Journal of Commerce that the board had been forced to pay $6.20 a barrel for heavy fuel oil on Thursday to get 5,000 barrels for its Fifty-ninth Street power plant to keep the subways running . Posted harbor prices range from $3 to $3.90 a barrel . The oil involved iii the Board of Transportation case is an industrial grade . Of " squeezes " on heating consumers there were rumors but no confirmation . Mayor O'Dwyer , Police Commissioner Arthur W. Wallander , regional fuel coordinator , and Charles H. Sells , state fuel coordinator , issued warnings that the city and state would act promptly to stamp out black marketing . After a meeting at Police Headquarters with 100 oil and coal wholesalers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the first Agri of a black market in fuel oil " the city would ask the Board of Health to declare an emergency and " will distribute the fuel itself if necessary . " Mr. Wallander said he was confident that fuel was being distributed equitably but added that the Police Department would invOstigate any fuel interests " not playing the game . " After a conference with the Policy Committee of the Fuel Oil Industry , representing the major suppliers , Mr. Sells said he had heard rumors of black marketing . but had obtained no concrete evi dence .. " It is unfortunate but true that we have a very susceptible situation for black market operations , " the ' state official remarked . - " The minute there is any evidence of-black market operations Lon -- an ? abnormal scale , I am prepared , and the Governor ( Thomas E. Dewey ) has - agreed to take state-wide measures on- a legislaItive or other basis to stop it , " he declared . With fuel oil supplies iri the state estimated to be 15 per cent below normal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a six-point program for oil conservation aimed to bring ' demand into line with supply . The major point was an agreement that all companies suggest to their distributors through their wholesalers that deliveries to_the consumers be- cut 15 per cent ' below last year 's deliveries . Under the oil industry 's voluntary program for allocating supplies and pooling Moldings to spread the supply tquitably , a few companies had adopted the 15 per cent proposal . The program makes it industrywide . The program , which is designed to assure an equitable sharing of the fuel oil supply and assure that no hardship cases occur so long as . consumers cooperate by conserving in the use of oil for heat , follows : , 1 . The committee suggests that ' all . old consumers of fuel oil for heat as of Dec. 31 , 1947 , be cut 15 per cent . below last year 's consumption immediately .. 2 . Distress cases may apply to . local coordinators who shall designate the amount to be suppIied.and by whom it shall be supplied . 3 . Oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse of this system .4 . Local coordinators shall meet periodically with local distributors land company representatives to determine the amounts of fuel oil which may be available . or may become available for distress cases . 5 .. A distress case shall be de , fined as follows : ( a ) a customer who has no previous regular source of supply ; ( b ) a customer who had not heated with fuel oil prior to Jan. 1 , 1948 ; ( c ) a customer whose previous supplier is out of business or out of oil . .6 . Local coordinators shall distribute equitably . all distress demands among the available suppliers . For New . York the . regional coordinator-is Mr. Wallander and the local coordinators are the Borough Presidents ' deputies working under him . Mr. Sells pointed out that Mayor O'Dwyer had set up his organization before the state organization was set up . The state will help the local set-up all it can but it will not interfere with it , he said . Upstate , except in the cities that have local set-ups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Department of Public Works and the local co- ' ordinators - are the county assistant engineers .. Mr. Sells warned that if consumers did not conserve oil voluntarily by reducing their consumption 15 per cent , more drastic measures might have to be taken . Sharper cuts may have to be imposed ? and theatres and bowling alleys . and similar establishments may have , to be closed , he said . ? The 15 per cent drop in supplies is only an estimate but it is the best available , he . explained . However , if consumers cooperate to this extent , he added , it can be hoped that the state can go through the winter without a further cut . In any event , he added , whatever the supply , it is going to be shared- equitably . Mr. Sells said he believed every ' oil producer was making every effort-to increase production of fuel , oil and there- was no - evidence at this time that this would create shortages in other petroleum products . ' He warned-that if there was ' any increase in fuel- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 or March 1 , if then . The first meeting of the coordinators and distributers will be held next Monday .. The oil policy committee adjourned " subject to call , but decided to-meeta again within a fortnight . Despite heroic ? efforts . by deliv-I dry . crews , some ' of them working fourteen to sixteen hours ; fuel oil deliveries were still off yesterday . Mr. Wallander said fuel oil deliveries were 60- per ' cent of normal yesterday but he pointed out that this : - was 100 per cent better than on . Thursday . " The weather is to be- colder , which will aggravate the situation , " he added . Mr. Wallander said about 100 fuel oil dealers ? attended the con- ' ference with the Mayor , himself ' and representatives- of all city departments . He said the city administration was looking forward to an equitable distribution of fuel oil but warned that the police would " take appropriate action if there is any black marketing . " Mayor O'Dwyer said that most fuel oil companies were cooperating and warned those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallander also spoke on this theme . The conference lasted for three and a half hours , during which Mr. Wallander explained that the department 's function would be mainly to coordinate distribution , as it did not want to regulate . The Mayor said that while most companies were cooperating , a few refused to deliver . to - homes certified by the police as " hardship cases . " Some of these , he ex ? plained , had not received deliveries lor two weeks . The 5,200 miles of city streets all are passable and there is no excuse for failure to distribute fuel in such cases , he added . Mr. O'Dwyer reported that the Police Department was receiving about 2,500 calls daily from consumers who were having trouble getting needed deliveries . ? Complaints received from the Health Department of no oil yesterday totaled 2,369 . No heat or not sufficient heat complaints totaled 1,586 . Since the beginning of the storm last Friday a total of 9,408 no heat complaints were received . The largest number , 1,721 , were received last Tuesday . What happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Transportation was related by Mr. Reid . Until recently the board had been getting No. 6 fuel oil at $3.75 a barrel under an agreement that has now expired . The board advertised for new proposals but got no bids . Then the snowfall came . The board , realizing that the subways would have to carry an extraordinary burden because of the failure of surface facilities , checked its power supply . The Consolidated Edison System could not give all the extra power required as the utility also helps meet other emergencies elsewhere in the state . The board decided to use some of the extra boilers in the Fifty-ninth Street plant . Twenty-five concerns were canvassed for the oil , but only one , a Staten Island broker , made an offer . No blame attaches to the broker , who offered to deliver oil to the dock by barge at the $6.20 price , because the broker had to pay a comparable price to get the oil . Lazarus Joseph , Controller , refused to approve the deal , while one of his subordinates made a vain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that no obi was available at a cheaper price , everyone , including Mayor O'Dwyer , approved the $6.20 deal , the oil was delivered and the subways continued to run their heavily burdened lines . The supply is enough . for two or three weeks . The board is trying to make arrangements for . delivery of a- large supply at -a more reasonable price .
