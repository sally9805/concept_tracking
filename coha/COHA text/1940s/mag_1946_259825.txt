There were 400 newsmen present at the opening of the United Nations organization in New York City 's Bronx . They were there to tell readers everywhere what went on as U.N . settled down to work . They were there also to subject the proceedings to the kind of journalistic observation and recording which has become a significant part of the U.S. brand of democratic government . <P> TIME was there , too ; in force , but not in numbers . Covering U.N. , now that it has gone to work , is not like covering a national political convention . For that kind of job you need a posse of experienced reporters to keep track of all the fast-breaking , variegated happenings which add up to the selection of a U.S. Presidential candidate . In U.N. , however , the debate takes place in front of you among the members of the eleven-man Security Council . A transcript of it is available at the close of each session . What counts is the research and background and the expert knowledge which , together , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting and present them to you as a clear , integrated , dramatic story . <P> It is not a job for amateurs . A university journalism student could tell you , more or less , what went on at U.N. , but what it means is another matter entirely . That is why we have assigned Robert Elson , chief of TIME 'S Washington bureau , to cover these important opening sessions . Elson , who was a fledgling reporter at the old League of Nations in Geneva in 1928 , has been the cornerstone of our U.N . coverage from the beginning . <P> With him at the birth of U.N . in San Francisco were Max Ways , now editing International and Foreign News , Anatole Visson , who can get along fluently in six foreign languages , and our Pacific <P> Coast bureau head , Sidney James . Later , when U.N . reassembled in London for its first formative meeting , our continuity of coverage was upheld by John Osborne , new London bureau head , who , as Foreign News and International editor , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et al . <P> Now , Elson 's only assistant at U.N . in The Bronx is Visson-but he has a very important function . Russian-born and a onetime European journalist , he has the job of seeing that we get the full drama and feel of the meeting . You have to hear the delegates speak and know what they are saying in their own tongues to catch the full flavor and sharpness of the debate . It also helps to be able to talk to them between sessions in their own languages . <P> <P> So much for the staff directly representing us at U.N . Those who complete our presentation to you of U.N . and its doings are the International , Foreign News and National Affairs writers , editors and researchers . <P> Altogether , they illustrate two basic concepts of TIME 'S kind of journalism : 1 ) that news , to be adequately presented , has to be studied deeply before it can be written , and 2 ) that the pool of knowledge to which our reporters , writers , editors and researchers contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information that any single journalist can provide . <P> Of course to have U.N . operating just twelve miles away from our home office here in Manhattan ( see map ) saves our writers , editors and researchers a lot of travel time . It is also pleasant to learn that ten of the eleven members of the Security Council read TIME regularly . Although they will undoubtedly turn out to be our severest critics .
