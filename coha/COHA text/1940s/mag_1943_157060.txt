Registrants may express preference for any of the three services , are assured their choice will get " the fullest consideration practicable . " Of those who pass , 20% will be sent to the seagoing outfits for training . The Army will get the rest . But the draftees who fail the test will not be sent home into Class 4-F . If they can meet the old physical standards they will be inducted , for service in the Army only . <P> <P> *Late in World War I both enrolled a few draftees.
