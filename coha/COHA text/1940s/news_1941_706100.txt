txt Limits on the hours that women an work in defense industry have seen lifted by the Commonwealth if Massachusetts , it was reported it the State House today . This step was viewed as one of the biggest contributions to the expansion of war production to be made here since America began its defense program . Hitherto women in Massachusetts have not been allowed to work more than nine hours a day , nor more than 48 hours a week . There was one qualification to the 48-hour limit . Women could work as many as 52 hours in seasonal industry , provided their average for the year did not exceed 48 These restrictions covered also male minors . Seven-Day Week Also women hitherto have not been permitted to work later than 10 o'clock at night . Consequently factory night shifts have taken ) women up to 10 p. in. , but no longer . Now the door is opened in ' vital defense industry to their being employed on liter night shifts . Women are also enabled to work seven days a week under another ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest in seven . This law applied to both men and women . It is an old law which has been extended at various times until now the only exemptions arc to be found in theaters and garages . The 9-hour-a-day and the 48-hour-a-week provisions for women were passed in 1919 when Calvin Coolidge was Governor . This is the first time they have ever been lifted . These old statutes were laid on the shelf by James T. Moriarty , Commissioner of Labor and Industries , in the determination to let no red tape hamper defense production for the duration of the war . He acted under the emergency powers given him under the General Laws at the appeal of President Roosevelt for seven-day-aweek production and with the cooperation of Gov . Saltonstall . No Blanket Permit However , Commissioner Moriarty is by no means granting a blanket permission to employers to v ? ork women more than the standard hours of the past . He is confining his permission strictly to defense industry . Civilian business , certainly at present , will not be allowed to employ women for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be made to him and proof submitted that the work on which women are employed is bona fide defense . In other words , defense plants will have to prove their needs , and the State will then try to help them . Nor will defense plants be forced to wore women for more hours than they have in the past . The decision on that will obviously be left to each plant according to its requirements . Lifting of the hour restrictions may be particularly useful to a The Massachusetts State Fedora. plant in a town where there is not , lion as good a supply of labor as in a ! its large center . In the big cities there are reports still of unemployed unskilled men . Employers will have to prove the necessity of working women after 10 p. m . The Commissioner has the authority to permit this , but will make a study and determination in each plant making request . The law 's limits on hours of women have long been recognized among labor people as a barrier to full production of defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to plans just made .
