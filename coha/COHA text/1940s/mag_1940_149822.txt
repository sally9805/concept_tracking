A little over one hundred years ago Harriet Martineau , a deaf but gifted English spinster , toured the U. S. equipped with reforming zeal , a philosophical and inquisitive mind , and a huge , old-fashioned ear trumpet which she aimed like a blunderbuss at the people she questioned . She discovered that only seven occupations were open to U. S. women : domestic service , keeping boarders , teaching young children , needlework , weaving , typesetting and bookbinding. * In 1840 two U. S. ladies , Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton , attended a World 's Anti-Slavery Conference in London , were first barred because of their sex , then permitted to listen to the proceedings from behind a screen . They walked down Great Queen Street that night , boiling mad , resolved to return to the U. S. and launch a holy war for woman 's rights . <P> Last week in Manhattan some 300 delegates assembled in a Woman 's Centennial Congress to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the struggle . It was a strange , emotional gathering , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern world contrasted with a vague program of action . It began with foreign delegates reporting on the status of women and of the women 's movement under totalitarianism . It ended , after about 20 hours of speechmaking and report-reading , with a Declaration of Purpose : " . . . to use our freedom to support , defend and preserve the Constitution , and to work for the progressive securing of freedom , social justice and peace for all people . " <P> What Next ? The Congress was not quite in the dilemma of the Prohibition Party after the adoption of the 18th Amendment : What to fight for ? But it faced a comparable problem of having achieved its obvious ends and of trying to find out the best uses of its power . In 1848 , Elizabeth Stanton called a convention of woman's-rights seekers that adopted a Declaration of Sentiments modeled on the Declaration of Independence : " The history of mankind is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations on the part of man toward woman , having in direct object the establishment of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grievances . Last week 's Congress pointed out how few of them still applied : <P> &gt; " He has never permitted her to exercise her inalienable right to the elective franchise . " <P> &gt; " He has compelled her to submit to laws , in the formation of which she has no voice . " <P> &gt; " He has made her , if married , in the eyes of the law , civilly dead . . . . He has taken from her all right in property , even to the wages she earns . " <P> &gt; " He has monopolized nearly all the profitable employments , and from those she is permitted to follow , she receives but a scanty remuneration . ... " <P> &gt; " He has denied her the facilities for obtaining a thorough education , all colleges being closed to her . " ( Last week it was reported at the Congress that 4,000,000 U. S. girls were in high school , 500,000 in college . ) <P> &gt; " He has usurped the prerogative of Jehovah himself . ... He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy her confidence in her own powers , to lessen her self-respect , and to make her willing to lead a dependent and abject life . "
