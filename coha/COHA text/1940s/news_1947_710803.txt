txt AFL REBUFFS LEWIS , OVERWHELMS PLEA TO DEFY LABOR LAW Convention Votes to Amend Constitution So Its Unions Can Get Act 's Protection ENDS HIS VICE PRESIDENCY Step Makes Unnecessary Oath by Lewis to Give Locals Access to the NLRB By LAWRENCE E. DAVIES Special to Tnz NEW Yoga Tans . SAN FRANCISCO , Oct. 14 ? John L. Lewis pleaded in vain today with some 700 fellow delegates to the American Federation of Labor 's annual convention not to " debase " themselves by amending the federation 's constitution to give ' Federal labor unions protection under the Taft-Hartley law . The convention voted to amend the constitution . For fifty-six minutes Mr. Lewis stood on the convention platform , ridiculing fellow officers , denouncing the new labor-management act , predicting the next session of Congress would make labor " grovel even more " if the AFL followed now those leaders " who run like cravens before the Taft-Hartley law . " He even gave notice that if the convention elected to take " this astounding action " which he opposed , " I can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the council of the American Federation of Labor . " " I will not be a candidate for election to this debased board , " he added . But after hours of argument , with spirited verbal exchanges between high AFL officers , the convention rejected the Lewis pleas and voted overwhelmingly to amend the constitution . Hutcheson ( loins Lewis Foes  - -  - A roll-call vote was unnecessary . When President William Green . put the motion just before 6 P. 7st. , observers estimated that hardly more thhn 100 of the delegates supported the president of the United Mine Workers . Even William L. Hutcheson , president of the Brotherhood of Carpenters , who had sided with him in recent executive council sessions , stood with those favoring the constitutional amendment . Under the amendment the title of vice president is stripped from thirteen members of the executive council , leaving in name only two officers , president and secretary-treasurer . The thirteen presContinue4 on Page 30 , Column 4 LEWIS VOTED DOWN BY AFL .

Lewis Is " Unsmiling Mr. Lewis was in his - best form when he walked , unsmiling , . eyes straight ahead , to the platform to make an appeal which he knew in advance was a - vain one . The committee on laws , headed by David Dubinsky , president of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union , had recommended the amendment , Thomas Kennedy , the miner union secretary-treasurer , had spoken against it . Frank Turco , representing the Newsboys Federal Union in Seattle , had brought applause and laughter by saying that " John Lewis has more respect in the American Federation of Labor than all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began-in typical Lewis fashion . " Thou shalt not muzzle the ox , " he said in measured tones . " But the Congress of , the United States designated 15,000,000 workers in this country , organized into unions , as being cattle . Congress placed an economic muzzle on each of you . " What are you going to do about it ? Oh , I see , they 're going to change the Constitution . God help us ! " Describing the Taft-Hartley Act as " the first mighty savage thrust of fascism in America , " he said it wa-s " bought and paid for by campaign contributions by the industrial and business interests of the country and the Republican party . Turning on AFL leaders , he said he himself belonged to " an organization whose members pay the officers to fight for them , not deliver them into slavery . " ? Those who bowed- to the act reminded him , he added , " of the Biblical passage , ' Lions Led by Asses ' , " and he referred to a " mighty host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having their thinking done for them by fat and stately asses . " " Paid Enough , " He Declares " You should think about these things , " he told the delegates . " You are paid enough . I try to shut my mouth and occasionally do some thinking . That 's what the AFL should do . " Mr. Lewis suggested it was unnecessary for hini to say he was not a Communist . He said the mine workers had been in the vanguard in " opposing the cast-iron Oriental philosophy of communism or any other ism in this country . " He chided other AFL leaders by saying that the Federation got its membership " by filing along behind the armored divisions of the UMW and mopping them up . " There would " never have been ' a CIO " if the AFL had listened to the mine workers in 1934 , he asserted , and instead of having 7,600,000 members today it would have had 25,000,000 " in my judgment . " Mr. Lewis said that he was opposing-the amendment on principle , that changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technique , to lie to escape responsibility . " He was interested only , he added , in obtaining " repeal " of the Taft-Hartley Act and he warned the delegates that " if you grovel enough ' in this convention you 're going to have more to grovel for when Congress meets next . " " If Congress sees us run , " he added , " they 'll fashion some sharp spears and makes run faster . " Concluding his speech , he said his threat to leave the executive council might be interpreted as " holding a gun before the head of this convention " but denied this was true . " I 'm merely stating the case , so you can act with full knowledge of the facts , " he added . " For , as far as that 's concerned , I think this Federation has no head ; I think its neck has just grown up and haired over . " Applause and shouts of " Pour it on , John , " came from the galleries at frequent intervals during the mine leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , president of the Brotherhood of Teamsters , the largest AFL international , who has opposed Mr. Lewis on the antiCommunist affidavit issue from the start , referred obliquely to one of the Lewis jibes in beginning his own speech in reply . " Delegates and fellow belly crawlers , " he shouted , " I want to say to the previous speaker that the Brotherhood* of Teamsters never crawled in their lives . When the mine workers were there on their bellies we tried to lift them up . " I do n't think we should take this issue half so seriously as the representatives of the United Mine Workers make out . The question is not of much importance . The executive council . will have the same powers , and will function just as before . " Why are we doing this ? To help 286,000 members that need our help . There is certain legal procedure to change the law and it is n't by revolution . Personally , I 'm happy to have a chance to say by affidavit , ' I 'm not a Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay with the federation even if the federation disagrees with me . We should not pull out every time something goes against one of us . I feared- two weeks ago we might have to take the teamsters out temporarily but my instructicuis were to protect my own union , but the overruling of Denham by the NLRB makes that unnecessary . " Mr. Tobin said that the NLRB chief counsel was not so much to blame for the present situation in the AFL " as we- - ourselves , " for " we have to protect the federal Unions and we could n't get unanimous action . " The attack on the Lewis stand was continued by George Meany , Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL , who called the issue a " practical problem " which could not . ' ibe solved " by impugning the integrity of men who feel they , can best represent their membership by complying with the law of the land . " He demanded that the AFL " not pull Communist chestnuts out of the fire , " saying that in 19 ' 35 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into the CIO and they 're there today . " " The president of the United ? Mine Workers , " Mr. Meany shouted , " said that Phil Murray is a. prisoner of the Communists . agree . Who walked out and left . him a prisoner ? " This was a reference to Mr .. Lewis ' return to the AFL after helping to found the CIO and be-. ing with it for years , Mr. Meany continued : " From 1935 to 1940 the president of the United Mine Workers with . his right hand upheld the NMU. against communism , but with his ; left hand he made friends with . Harry Bridges ( president of the CIO International Longshoremen 's ; and Warehousemen 's Union ) , Mi .. chael Quill ( head of the CIO Transport Workers ) , Jules Emspack : ( secretary-treasurer of the CI() Electrical Workers ) , Lewis Merrin ( recently retired president of the : CIO Office and Professional Work-. ers ) and all the other stinking ' America haters who love Mos- ? cow . " Mr. Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a correction . When he began speaking , Mr. Meany objecteed . " Point of order , that 's not a correction , " he shouted . President Green told Mr. Lewis he might proceed " as a personal ) privilege " and the mine leader said , " Of course Communists came into the CIO . " Then he told of plans being pushed by AFL leaders to bring CIO unions and their memberships into the federation . " In the light of that , " he went on , " I ask who now are willing to become the comrades of Communists ? " Mr. Meany rejoined to this taunt : " Whatever action this convention takes this delegate will go along with it . He wo n't pick up his bat and ball and go home . " After several others had spoken , Mr. Green and Mr. Dubinsky stated the issue and asked for a favorable vote on the amendment . The result was about what had been predicted . The Lewis battle , which ' had I been in process of building up during the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , including adoption of a vigorous foreign policy statement , and speeches by Kurt Schumacher , chairman of the Social Democratic party of Germany , Joseph Keenan , labor adviser to the American Forces of Occupation in Germany , and Henry Rutz , special AFL representative in Germany . The laws committee proposed that the AFL require each union to pay the parent body 26 cents a year for every member for " emergency purposes . " This , would add an estimated $2,000,000 a year to an estimated $1,000,000 to be realized by a per capita tax increase for publicity purposes . Some top council members savor asking every AFL member to contribute $1 each voluntarily . This would all add up to what some delegates suggested might be the largest political fund ever raised by a political organization . A bitter attack on Soviet foreign policy occupied the morning session . The convention called for free trade unions in Germany as a key to prevention of World War III and put forth a broad program to alleviate " grave international tension . " Charging that the primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and promote chaos , " the convention threw the support of the 7,600,000 AFL members to the Marshall plan , asking for exploitation of " every type of voluntary action " to block any domestic economic disruption that might threaten because of extensive exports to Europe . At the same time it demanded Government controls , ii necessary , to check speculation and inflation if voluntary regulations failed or if serious shortages should develop in grain or other commodity markets . The Federation urged amend . ment of the United Nations Charter to abolish the " Big Five " vetc power , . and asked that all powers withdraw their armies of occup ? tion " from other lands simultane. ously " and end peacetime military conscription . Adopting without debate a report of its committee on international labor relations , read by Matthew Woll , an AFL vice president , the convention accused the " Soviet dictatorship " of " treating the United States as if it were already at war against the American people . " " The Soviet propagandists , " the report stated , " have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have been pouring out billions to help save millions from famine on both sides of the iron curtain . The Soviet Government-owned press and its servile agents and tools in every land are feverishly howling for an economic collapse in the United States . " In Germany the " enormous military machine of Russian totalitarianism and its vast network of agents and henchmen have been mobilized to control the reviving trade unions , " the report charged , adding : " Just as Hitler needed a supine and helpful Russia in his rear before he could launch World War II , so must the Russian dictators have a Germany controlled by them before they can risk plunging mankind into World War Ia . The maintenance of a free , healthy , democratic and independent Germany is , therefore , the key to the prevention of another international conflagration . " The convention included as a target of its slashing attack the world federation of trade unions , to which the Congress of Industrial Organizations but not the AFL belongs , and in which Russia plays a dominant role . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " economic disintegration " included release of all prisoners of war with permission to return to their homelands and " resume as free men and women their active part in rebuilding economic life .
