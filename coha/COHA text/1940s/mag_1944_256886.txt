Every now &; then Manhattan 's glassy Museum of Modern Art stages a strange but provocative show . Some visitors are impervious ; others leave with their bonnets abuzz . Last week , on the somewhat dusty subject , " Are Clothes Modern ? , " the " Museum confronted visitors with some sharp displays and comments by Austrian-born Architect-Designer Bernard Rudofsky . On the thesis that clothes are always artificial , often absurd , sometimes harmful , the exhibition ranged from clanky chest armor to bird-cage bustles . <P> " Are Clothes Modern ? " jeers at the world and his wife for wearing symmetrical shoes on unsymmetrical feet , for walking on the punishing pavements of cities when resilient plastic composition would carry weary legs twice as far , for not wearing toga-like clothes-the only truly modern costume , which can flow from machinery like newspapers from presses. * <P> The show was not the Museum 's most successful flea-in-the-ear . But the average visitor was bound to react to some of the exhibits , come away with an idea or two , even a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big toe in the middle : Looks better there . Why not change the feet and keep the shoes ? <P> On seeing a centaur-like figure caricaturing the bustled woman : Rather decorative as a matter of fact . <P> On reading that women passionately defend high heels because they are a focus of erotic attention : Is that bad ? <P> On gazing into the last exhibit , a plain , full-length mirror : It 's a good thing that woman behind me does n't know how funny she looks . <P> <P> * Reports from Germany last week said that Reich Marshal Hermann Gring had taken to wearing a toga at tea .
