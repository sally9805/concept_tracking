DOSTOEVSKI-Ernest J. Simmons-Oxford ( $3 ) . <P> Behind the black-bearded , wild-eyed , dome-browed face of Fedor Dostoevski brooded one of the great analytical minds of literature . This " engineer of human souls , " as Biographer Ernest Simmons calls him , graduated from a military engineering college in 1843 , tunneled such depths into man 's mind , spanned such cataracts of feeling , built such a monumental Cloaca Maxima of passionate drama that a contemporary critic said of Crime and Punishment that people with strong nerves became almost ill over the novel , and people with weak nerves were obliged to cease reading it . <P> Dostoevski 's life was as subterranean as the human nature he wrote of . As a young writer he haunted the windy corners and foul alleys of hated St. Petersburg , was sentenced to death for revolutionary conspiracy , instead spent four years in prison , six years ' exile in Siberia . Jailed with murderers &; thieves , he exclaimed : " What a wonderful people ! On the whole I did not lose my time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wretched affair with Polina Suslova , a wild , rebellious hussy who bobbed her hair , wore dark glasses , never went to church . He lusted for roulette , thought he had a " system , " was systematically cleaned out . He sifted the newspapers for tales of murder , scandal , disaster , folly . The wary police eyed him till death exiled him for good in 1881 . <P> This sinning , suffering , repenting novelist has impressed two generations chiefly as a religious philosopher . Predicted cranky , omniscient Oswald Spengler : " To Dostoevski 's Christianity the next thousand years will belong . " <P> With this view Ernest Simmons , onetime Harvard professor and biographer ( 1937 ) of Byronic Poet Alexander Pushkin , has little patience . Simmons denies the widespread notion that Siberian exile altered the thought and method of " one of the most original novelists in world literature . " Dostoevski 's originality combined 1 ) his distrust for Western European culture ; 2 ) his belief in feeling against reason ; 3 ) his expert , unprecedented child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radicals in The Possessed ; 5 ) his great character types-the Meek , the Double , the Self-Willed . <P> The Double , or split personality , such as Raskolnikov of Crime and Punishment , " thirsts for power and is powerless , he desires to torture and to be tortured , to debase himself and to debase others , to be proud and to humble himself . " Dominance of one trait characterizes the Meek ( quixotic Prince Myshkin of The Idiot , as also the Self-Willed ( the murderer Verkhovenski in The Possessed ) . <P> " They call me a psychologist , " pro tested Dostoevski . " It is not true . I am merely a realist ' in the higher sense of the word , that is , I depict all the depths of the human soul . "
