txt The next question we face in Greece concerns our attitude toward the regime . In what manner and to what extent does the program in support of Greek independence commit . us or entitle us to intervene in internal politics ? One thing we can not do is to impose on the Greeks a government of our choosing . This would be to do what we accuse the Russians of doing in their satellite states and what we are acting to prevent them from doing in Greece . Aside from that , however , aside from satisfying the Greeks , any American mission would find it extremely difficult to conjure out of the hat an administration that would satisfy the assorted views of Americans . There just is n't any political hat that fits more than a fraction of the citizens of Greece . Every one who has tried it knows that even in the comparatively tranquil days before the war , before Metaxas , one of the trickiest reporting jobs in the world was to get and give a balanced view of the political picture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood have been poured out , fear and misery have produced a kind of delirium inside the country , and outsiders going in with eyes turned Right or Left fail to see the poor people in the middle . Background Is Needed It takes a lot of background to understand the situation we are now stepping into . Our professed principle is to free the country from the panic that demoralizes government and people and give them a chance to choose the kind of regime they desire . This should ' be the guiding principle of our policy and we should resist the easy temptation to depart from it . The catch is that the Greeks will continue to be politically divided . On the main issue , between monarchy and republic , the balance was very close in peacetime . It may have swung decisively during the war ; nobody knows , because in last year 's plebiscite republicans voted monarchist in fear of a Communist dictatorship . This is ' the kind of false choice people make in the trap of terror . It is one of the reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal conditions are restored . Creating a normal atmosphere will be in itself a powerful political influence . So will the controls the American Government will place on the use of the money allotted to Greece in the aid program . Already mapped/ out , these controls will govern military expenditures , agricultural production , reconstruction , currency stabilization , even government costs . While the proposed powers are strictly advisory , they can not , help affecting the economic and political administration of the country . The military advisers , for instance , will be in position to demand that a truly national army is organized to combat irregulars of the Right as well as of the Left . The economic experts will be in position td weed out the overloaded bureaucracy , described by somebody as " a form of unemployment relief , " presumably for the friends of those in power , and put back on farms or in factories young men who join the guerrilla bands because they have no other occupation . Seasoned observers caution against the use of direct political pressure . They hope that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the British , will not repeat British mistakes . It is noteworthy that the chief mistake , in the opinion of these critics , was too much interference in politics . In fairness to the British it should be remembered that they marched into a very hot spot when they entered Athens in 1944 . The EAM was determined to seize power without waiting for an election . It attempted to do so by force , and this rising , with its reckless bloodshed and the reckless measures taken to suppress it , started the train of reprisals and vendettas that turned Greece into a land of terror and its civil war into an engagement in the campaign for control of the Balkans . The Situation Clears The situation is clearer now . Greece has been adopted as a position the United States feels bound in its own interest to strengthen as a barrier against indefinite Soviet expansion . The report of the American member - of the United Nations investigating commission confirms the charge that Yugoslavia and Bulgaria have interfered in Greek internal affairs with the aim of annexing Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pres- , ident Truman and Secretary Marshall to act . The question of Greek democracy comes in only because without our support the Greeks ifIrould have no chance to develop into a democracy and the area of free choice left in Europe would be so much narrower . The present regime has few defenders . It apparently has no program but anti-communism and no capacity either to improve the lot of the people or to unite them by a generous gesture of reconciliation . The Greeks deserve a leadership that heals dissension instead of aggravating it , but . it must be said that they have seldom had it . Today 's Government is about as good as the average between the wars . It was voted in by a large majority in an election watched by several hundred foreign observers . The responsibility for the exclusion of the Left parties lies on those who abstained from voting . They are not prevented from agitating ; there is an active Communist headquarters in Athens and the Communist newspaper , Rizopastis , is free to publish daily attacks on the Government and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more like democracy than anything in the neighborhood .
