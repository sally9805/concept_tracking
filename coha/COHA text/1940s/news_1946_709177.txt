txt Plain Speaking Is Expected It is indicated that the President intends to deal in his address not only with what has not been done by Congress following his recommendations , but how some of the things it did were done . It is indicated , too , the President 's word , will leave little if anything to the imagination as to just how he feels about some Congressional actions . Nor was the plainspeaking of the President expected to be confined wholly to Congress . There were signs that a part of the address would be focused upon the labor-management situation , with Mr. Truman letting the country know , without picking a quarrel with labor , how he stands and reacts to developments in that field . After the Presidential yacht Williamsburg tied up at the Washington Navy Yard early this morning , Mr. Truman had breakfast aboard and then drove to the White House . He slipped away later and was driven to Union Station , where he welcomed Mrs. Truman and their daughter , Margaret , on their arrival from their Christmas visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the station only by a small detachment of Secret Service men . During the rest of the dky the President 's usually long list of callers was cut down to a single visitor . Work on the address , : hich had not been completed dur ? . , g the cruise , was the order of the ay . gress thus far viewed the Democratic legislative situation against a background such as the following : The " full-employment " program , passed in materially modified form by the Senate and giving way to far greater revision in the House , remained in conference , untouched through the Christmas adjournment . The measure through which the ; President sought to increase unemployment compensation to a country-wide maximum standard of $25 a week for twenty-six weeks remained shelved after months during which no efforts have been made to revive it . The national health program has made no progress . Notice has been served on the , Senate that soon after its return an attempt will be made to call up the measure to establish a permanent Fair Employment Practices Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other impending programs . Mr. Truman vetoed the $51,000,000,000 appropriation cutbacks bill , rather than accept along with it a " rider " which would have forced the return of the United States Employment Service to the States within 100 days . Minimum-wage legislation , to inicrease the present floor of 40 cents an hour to 65 cents , and to 75 cents ( ' in two years , must undergo further hearings before Senate action is taken . This measure , however , is not viewed as being in serious trouble , though it may undergo revision . While the President 's September message to Congress contained no ; legislative recommendations , he has since sought prompt action on his fact-finding committee plan . Hearings have been scheduled for Jan. 14 , the day Congress returns to work . Some Presidential recommendations regarding the supporting of agricultural prices have been carried out in one form or another . but there lies ahead a major Congressional battle over the Administration 's desire to revise the parity price formula .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
