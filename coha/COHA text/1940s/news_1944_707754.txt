txt Governor Thomas E. Dewey declared tonight in a radio report to the people on State affairs that he has striven to establish in Albany " a genuinely competent and progressive government , in sharp contrast with that type of government which talks fine phrases of liberalism while seeking to impose its will and its whims upon the people through centralized bureaucracies issuing directives from a distance . " The Governor said that after his first year in office he was able to report a fair beginning on the task of " cleaning out , from the departments and agencies . of the State , the accumulated cobwebs of twenty years . " " In the last twelve months , " he added , " without interrupting or disturbing for a moment the dayto-day business of the State , that job has made tremendous progress . We have now in Albany a complete administration , infused with new blood and new energy , filled with a spirit of team-work between the legislative and executive branches , working in cooperation with each other , with the people of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are closest to the people . " Praises Soldier Vote Law Although the 3,000-/ord speech was devoted mainly to legislative and administrative accomplishments , Governor Dewey repeatedly drew a contrast between State and Federal affairs . He defended the State 's soldier vote law as " simple and workable " and criticized the Federal plan backed by President Roosevelt 's supporters in Congress . " This soldier ballot , " he asserted . " will not be the blank piece of paper which was sponsored in Washington , nor will it , as the National Government tried to do , deprive the soldier of his constitutional right to vote for every office to be filled . " It will give every man and woman in the armed services , by the simple act of signing his name once , ot valid vote for every candidate from President down to the local officers in his home town . " Under this New York law voting is simpler for a soldier on ' foreign service than it is for a citizen here at home , and the honest ' ballots cast by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other proposals would have permitted . " Governor Dewey said the $163 , - 000,000 surplus with which the State started this fiscal year was piled up as a result of abnormal wartime conditions and of good State housekeeping . He warned that it is a fund to be held hi trust for those who are in the armed forces and for the millions of war workers who will turn to peacetime pursuits when hostilities cease . Reconversion Plans Under Way He said the State is hard at work planning for the day of reconversion to peace . " When the day of reconversion comes , " he said , " New York State will approach it , not merely with blueprints and bond issues to create new debts ; we will have ready for instant use a minimum of $163 , - 000,000 cold cash . Moreover , the State Department of Commerce is working intensively with business , big and small , all over the State , for the new industries and quick change-overs , which will provide the great bulk of opportunity and employment for our people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent reduction in the State income tax , but said the most gratifying feature was the introduction of a new and simpler one-page form . He said the State was fortunate to have , in the president of the Tax Commission , a Cabinet officer " who is out to make taxation more simple , rather than to drape it in mysterious complexities . " Governor Dewey said eighteen recently enacted amendments to the Workmen 's Compensation Law will help correct long-standing evils in its administration and that his goal is to " drive the thieves permanently from the field of workmen 's compensation . " Singled out for special praise was the creation of a State School of Labor and Industry at Cornell University , which , the Governor said , can become a " meeting ground for industrial statesmanship . " Explains Racial Program Referring to failure of the Legislature to enact anti-discrimination legislation proposed by the committee which had been studying the problem , the Governor said it was riot submitted until two weeks before adjournment of the Legislature and that he was advised that , " despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken at the 1944 session . To assure progress in the Meantime , he added , he recommended passage of a bill , recently signed , creating a twenty-threemember commission to study the problem . The Governor included among the year 's accomplishments elimination of the so-called " means test " for care in county tuberculosis hospitals ; enactment of a bill paving the way for efficient reorganization of the Health Department ; centralization of administrative authority in the hands of the New York City Superintendent of Schools ; elimination of legal technicalities standing in the way of proper aid to the blind , the aged and needy children , and progress in the establishment of centers for the care of children whose mothers are emp'oyed in war industry . Governor Dewey discussed what the Stale had done and was doing for returning veterans . He said unemployment insurance was assured to every returning New York veteran ; that a commission had been created to study plans for aid of veterans and to assist them and their families in learning of the many provisions which exist for their help ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that plans had been set in motion for a system of vocational courses throughout the State .
