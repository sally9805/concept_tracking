( MARCH OF TIME ) is a scoop by a British UNRRA cameraman , Peter Hopkinson , who has made more intimate shots of Russian life than most foreigners manage to , and has succeeded in bringing his film out uncensored . There are revealing glimpses of plain Russians in the streets , in hospitals , in theaters , in churches , in schools , in orphanages . Some of the film 's most interesting revelations are not breathless news , but are very convincing . Among the strong impressions left by this study of scores of faces : 1 ) Russians are bitterly poor but their fortitude evidently goes as deep as their poverty ; 2 ) religion , among religious Russians , is still a strong and deep-rooted influence ; 3 ) children are treated with kindness and gayety , and the treatment blooms in their faces ; 4 ) the Soviet bureaucracy , whatever its sins and shortcomings , appears to have a strong sense of responsibility toward the masses-if none toward individuals-and the masses respond with loyalty ; 5 ) unlike the handful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary Russians represented in this film look as likable and trustworthy as any other large group of human beings .
