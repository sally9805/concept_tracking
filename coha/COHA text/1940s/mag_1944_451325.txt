rEit fourteen years of close association with George Santayana , I find myself separated from him by the exigencies of war . At the moment of writing , he is living in a private nursing home in Rome , while I have returned to the place of my birth , New York . Naturally I have been unable to keep in touch with him by letter and inform him of the many anxious inquiries made by his friends in this country . Under the circumstances , I have felt a kind of persistent inner compulsion to solidify in words , while the materials of memory are fresh and plastic , my recollections of him . The Santayana that I know is the older Santayana : he was sixty-three when I first met him . His life may be divided conveniently into two parts , the line being drawn when he gave up teaching at Harvard in 1012 and left America for good . To the first half belong the poet , the interpreter of poetry and religion , and the author of The Life of Beason . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory only of Santayana II the elderly gentleman who turned novelist for a season and gave us The Last Puritan , the metaphysician laboring for years on his profound Realms of Being , the autobiographer now completing his Persons and Places . In 1926 , when I was twenty-one years old , I left New York to live in London , and I intended to continue my studies abroad as long as I ? or rather my grandmother ? could afford it . My interests were divided equally between poetry and philosophy , and in the writings of Santayana I had discovered a wonderful marriage of the aesthetic and intellectual sides of the mind that moved me deeply . So after a year in England I decided to write an essay on his work . For six weeks I shut myself up in a room on the top floor of a boardinghouse in South Kensington . When finally my essay was cornA New Yorker who has lived and studied for many years abroad , pleted I determined to send it to Santayana himself and ask him to tell me frankly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied me with his address , and the rest I left to fate . A week of anxiety ensued , and then one morning a letter postmarked Roma and addressed in a large , clear handwriting arrived . To put it tritely , my fondest expectations were surpassed by the flattering comments he made on my paper , which was subsequently published in the Journal of Philosophical Studies . In replying to Santayana I expressed my desire to meet him . I mentioned that Rome would be a long and expensive trip for me , and that if he intended to come to Paris in the near future , I could manage that much better . He answered in clue course and suggested that if I cared to take the sea voyage from Tilbury to Naples , he would be pleased to defray the expenses of the trip . As I look back over the last twenty years of my life , I ask myself if I have ever been quite so happy , so filled with suppressed excitement , as on that morning in early April , 1927 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailed for Italy . In Rome , I booked in at a small hotel-pension in the Via Quattro Fontane . Santayana 's large but rather old-fashioned hotel was islet down the street in the Piazza Barberini . ( He had already lived there for about twelve years when I first met him . ) I remember I was a bit nervous about seeing him , and loitered for a long time in the broad sun-splashed piazza . At last I sent my name upstairs and was soon in the lift on the way to his apartment . I had never seen a photograph of Santayana , and only knew vaguely that he must be over sixty years old . But I had imagined him as rather thin and very remote . I was wrong down to the last detail . The man who arose from his.desk to greet me was portly and genial . A contagious smile , large brown flashing eyes ( extremely Spanish ) , and an ample waistline ( which I always associate with affability ) reassured me at once . Something youthful about his manner and conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . I forgot completely that I was with a much olcler man ; and for his part , Santayana was surprised when I told him that I was only twenty-two . I remember vaguely that he seemed rather impatient that afternoon when I spoke about his poetry or his earlier books on aesthetics and religion . He said something to the effect that " aesthetics is only a part of psychology , " and reminded me that Matthew Arnold was " in the air " when he wrote his Interpretations of Poetry and Religion . Perhaps he dreaded that I would ply him with carefully planned technical questions , as so many young students and professors did at their first and only meetings . If ho failed that afternoon to measure up to a very immature ideal of the " great philosopher " that I expected to meet in Rome , it is because I misunderstood a certain lightness of word and manner that is characteristic of Santayana in conversation . There was certainly nothing " difficult " about him , and this was all to the good as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to luncheon , and afterwards we would either go for a stroll in the Pincio or take a carrozza to some place of interest in Rome ? if it was too distant for walking . Museums and picture galleries were excluded , however , for it tired and bored Santayana to mingle with the groups of wide-eyed tourists shepherded by shouting guides . And of course he had seen and studied everything as a younger man . Sometimes we would visit a remote church to see , for example , a lovely window of stained glass ; or drive to a position on one of the surrounding hills that afforded a wonderful view of the campagna and the city below us . I could not have had a more sympathetic guide : Santayana knew Rome like a native , and we did things in a very leisurely manner . From my own point of view , our luncheons together were great events ? and I am speaking materially as well as spiritually . At first he took me to very fashionable restaurants : the subterranean Ulpia , the elevated sunlit Castello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glorious Villa Borghese . But later on we frequented a popular Italian restaurant in the heart of the city . Food always made an enormous difference to Santayana : it was striking the way it would fortify him almost immediately . All the fatigue of a longmorning of writing , and the weight of age , seemed to disappear like magic as soon as the bread had been broken and the wine poured . I tried not to tire him : I never planned any special question to ask him and after luncheon I let the discussion grow out of what George Meredith has called a " post-digestive calm . " One afternoon , however , I inadvertently ruffled the more sensitive side of Santayana 's nature . We were gazing at St. Peter 's from some high point of vantage , and Santayana , after pointing out the private railroad that ran through the spacious grounds of the Vatican , began explaining some de , tail of ecclesiastical administration to me . For some obscure reason ( I am a low Presbyterian ) I suddenly blurted out as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All this has nothing to do with the simple Master who walked by the Sea of Galilee . I wonder indeed what He would think if He returned to the world today and saw this power organization at work . " Santayana was not only astonished but angry at my remark . I think he considered it a crude and impertinent expression of a provincial kind of Protestant prejudice . He controlled himself by saying nothing and we walked along in total silence . I realized I had been a bit flippant , and I apologized for my hasty observation . He forgave me immediately , and I remember fairly accurately what he then said , because it made a strong impression on me . " I 'm a little surprised at your attitude , " he began , " because I hoped that you were more sympathetic to a great tradition like the Catholic Church . Even if its early history is bloody , ? full of political intrigue and other imperfections , ? is it not perhaps wiser to accept such a tradition in toto than to pick flaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself ? you can not hold the official doctrine , it is better to regard the whole thing as an expression of the human spirit than to attempt to get back to a few hypothetical sayings and actions of its alleged Founder , and then base your whole religion and theology on such a flimsy foundation . " The trouble with Catholicism , " Santayana went on , " is not that it is too ornamental or symbolic , ? the usual Protestant criticism , ? but that it is too human ? too good to be true . I simply can not believe that nature at large can conform so closely to the heart 's desire . " We were having tea one afternoon in a cafe near the Esedra ? that " crescent of modern white buildings " the visitor first sees as he leaves the railway station . I had then been in Rome for about six weeks , and as my funds were getting low , I said something to the effect that I must return to London shortly and arrange things for my trip back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarked that it would be a pity not to see Paris . I answered that I planned to stop there for a few days before crossing the Channel to England . Suddenly he turned to me and said in a very frank , almost boyish way : " How would you like to help me with the preparation of The Realm of Matter ? I could do with a secretary for a year or so , and you 're just the person . " I was so startled and excited by his question that I nearly strangled on an undissolved lump of sugar in my teacup , but I managed to answer quite calmly , " Why , I think it 's a splendid idea . " The conditions subsequently agreed upon could not have been happier from my point of view . In the first place , Santayana was to turn over the manuscript of The Realm of Matter to me ( I shall have more to say concerning the nature of any secretarial duties shortly ) ; secondly , I could live wherever I wished in Europe and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when it proved convenient ; and lastly , he promised to support me until his book was ready for publication . This time limit to our arrangement was emphasized by Santayana , as he did not wish to mislead me in regard to my eventual future . But he said that the work on The Realm of Matter " would occupy us " for about two years . A few days later I left for Paris . I did not take The Realm of Matter with me , as Santayana said he would bring it himself to Paris at the end of the month . And in the meantime he advised me to brush up on my French so that I would feel more at home . 3 WHEN Santayana arrived a little later , I was surprised to learn ? in view of his customary detachment ? that for several summers he had been in the habit of residing with an old American friend , Mr. C. A. Strong , in an apartment on the Avenue de l'Observatoire near the Luxembourg . As I had heard nothing previously about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old gentlemen had exchanged letters before deciding whether or not I should be a possible nuisance in Paris . But Mr. Strong must have been impressed by what Santayana wrote him , for I was soon invited over to the Left Bank for discussion . I discovered that their apartment had become a kind of summer headquarters for visiting American professors , and one afternoon Henri Bergson had come over from Passy for tea . As it is impossible to move in the orbit of Santayana without taking into account the existence of the less famous philosophical body of Mr. Strong , I shall say something more about him . Santayana and Strong ( I shall now drop the Mr. ? as he himself shortly urged me to ) had been friends since college days , and judging by early photographs that I have seen of them , they must have been two very good-looking young men when they shared a Harvard fellowship together in Germany over fifty years ago . But Strong had become exclusively and passionately interested in a set of philosophical puzzles that have been dignified by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be defined roughly as an attempt to explain how we know what we know without studying philosophy . This was Strong 's self-appointed lifework , and having toiled unceasingly over his puzzles for four decades , his hottest soul had become embittered by a strange lack of public attention . Fortunately , I had read one of his books , The Origin of Consciousness , and he was delighted to find someone who appreciated his labors . I listened with great interest , o everything Strong said , for although I was Santayana 's avowed disciple ( a source of unavoidable irritation to Strong ) , all problems in philosophy were fresh and fascinating to me . But with Santayana it was different . His mind was made up : his official doctrine had been made public . And Strong 's inability or refusal to recognize this obvious fact amazed me . In my innocence I failed to realize that nothing could be more calamitous to a man of Strong 's nature ( and there are other philosophers like him ) than to have any question finally settled . Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some day there might be a scarcity of bones to growl over , but it is somehow repugnant to the Protestant conscience itself , which demands either a subjective Devil or an epistemological problem to wrestle with forever and ever . Strong was a lonely man for all his wealth , and the fact that he had become a cripple , and had to use a wheelchair to get about in , had not helped matters . Unlike Santayana , he depended upon other people to keep his spirits up . He was miserable unless there was some fellow philosopher at hand for him to whet his thoughts on . And for years Santayana had served this purpose admirably . Although on all the major issues in philosophy they were in substantial agreement , when it came to some special minute bone of contention , there was often a violent tempest in a teapot . For Strong had worked very hard over his puzzles , and it dismayed him to find his old and distinguished friend reluctant to accept his pet solutions . But behind all these superficial disagreements were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic by family ties and senthnent , and a litterateur as well as a metaphysician ; while Strong was an American , a Puritan by instinct , with an admiration for the scientific side of philosophy : 4 MY PENSION ' was only a few minutes from the Champs Elysees and there I came to work on the huge manuscript of The Realm of Matter , written in Santayana 's own hand . He explained what he wanted me to do . He had composed two or three drafts of nearly every chapter of the hook , and ho asked me to study these alternative accounts of the same topics , mark out the passages or paragraphs I liked best , and then try to reconstruct , as it were , the ideal chapters to compose the final version of his book . I was duly impressed and somewhat alarmed at the nature of my task , but Santayana was sympathetic and genial , and I knew of course that he would have the last word about everything . As a matter of fact , he was rather fed up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the burden of revising a difficult book onto another person . Although I was unaware of it at the time , lie was already beginning to sketch out the chapters of The Last Puritan ? a novel which had been revolving in his mind for many years . I might as well anticipate the course of events and confess at once that on the whole I failed to help Santayana as much as he expected me to ? at least , this is true of my work on The Realm of Matter . The painful discovery that I was not an indispensable collaborator did not dawn on my mind immediately . I would study each chapter leisurely , and then write out a list of " suggestions " on a separate page . And though a number of my incidental hints were accepted gratefully , I fear that those ambitious reconstructions were silently rejected . Apart from philosophy , I think it was a relief for Santayana to get away from the apartment and have a different kind of friend in Paris . I showed him my poems ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strong did not share ) ; lie helped me with my French , using Le Temps as a kind of daily textbook . And sometimes we went to a matinee at the Odeon or Thatre-Franeais . In the evening we would often meet at some caf ? - restaurant ? say the Angleterre on the Boulevard des Italiens . After a Pernod ( sometimes two ) he would order dinner to be served outdoors in the cool of the evening . Philosophy was forgotten as we watched the gay cosmopolitan throng or commented on the casual news of the day . That is to say , technical discussion was banned , but I felt that I was realizing a certain philosophy of life that I had never found in America . Around nine-thirty Santayana would say good-night . He liked to stroll alone by the Seine for about a half an hour before taking his favorite foot . bridge across the river on his way to the apartment near the Luxembourg . It actually took more than two years to trim The Realm of Matter down to fighting ? or rather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my meager share in the preparation of the book was finished . And late that June , Santayana and Strong had gone to Glion-sur-Montreux in Switzerland instead of Paris , for the latter had decided to spend the summer at his clinic , and had persuaded San . tayana to go to a near-by hotel so that he could drive with him in the afternoons ? and discuss epistemology. 5 IHAD just decided to leave Venice and prepare for my return to America , when I received a letter from Santayana . He asked me to come to Switzerland for the rest of the summer , saying that he and Strong wanted to see me . Naturally I was delighted at the idea of seeing Switzerland for the first time , but I wondered if this visit was intended as a gra. cious farewell gesture . When I arrived at Montreux the following night , it was so dark that I could see nothing of my new surroundings , but the air ? especially after Venice ? was like a glass of cool champagne . The hotel bus was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santayana had waited up to greet me . He was in a very jolly mood , and I think the mountains must have done him good . After the usual exchange of polite inquiries , lie came to the point of my visit , " If you still do n't want to return to America , " he said , " I think that Strong has something of interest to tell you . He is now writing a book on the origin of the mind , and it might be a good idea for you to live in Florence this winter and assist him in any way you can . But Strong will tell you the rest himself . " Relieved by these unexpected good tidings , I slept well that night . It must have been around nine-thirty in the morning when I was awakened by Santayana 's knocking at my door . We had arranged to have breakfast downstairs together at half past eight , and I imagine he had got tired of waiting for me . But have n't you seen yet the view from your balcony ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several minutes admiring the magnificent panorama , and Santayana pointed out and identified for me the distant towns and mountain ranges . Although he is nearsighted himself and thinks in words rather than visual images ( he once told me that when lie dreams it is always of people talking rather than of how people look ) , he can appreciate large masses of color . I led a very luxurious life at Glion for the rest of the summer . Santayana and I had all our meals together in the spacious dining room , and several times a week we would go driving with Strong after luncheon . Santayana worked hard as usual in the mornings , and most of our conversation took place at mealtime . The dining room was a bit too noisy and glaring for him , but on Saturday evenings , before the weekly hotel dance , he would rise to the occasion and order champagne as well as our customary wine . Santayana had visited Strong many times at his villa in Fiesole , and he had duly warned me of the Anglo-American aesthetic accent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is true that Bernard Berenson lived a few miles away at Settignano , and that the Sitwell family was equally distant ; but the famous Villa Medici ? where Lady Sybil and Percy Lubbock held court ? was situated within a stone 's throw of Strong 's winter philosophical headquarters . All in all , I passed a difficult winter with Strong . Apart from his fanatical desire to convert other people to his own epistemological point of view ( which itself was constantly undergoing modifications , so that you never knew exactly where you were in an argument with him ) , I suffered intensely from colitis . It was the psychological climate that affected me as much as the dampness of a cold Tuscany winter . I had no friends or external distractions to relieve the monotony . Strong and I would talk philosophy by the hour , and it would be ungracious in me not to confess that these endless conversations sharpened my own ideas and helped to define , by way of contrast , Santayana 's own position in theory of knowledge . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Essays on the Natural Origin of the Mind ? and it was generous of him to acknowledge my assistance in the preface . Whenever I write an article on epistemology nowadays , I realize anew that those long hours at Fiesole were not misspent , and I am still haunted by the spectacle of Strong shaking his finger at me and saying , " Cory ! That is not the right word for what you really mean . " Finally , when the spring came and turned Florence into a paradise again , Santayana invited one to Rome for a long visit . He had gathered that I was not happy at Fiesole , and so had arranged with Strong to look after me until the following autumn . 6 Tr WAS during the spring of 1030 in Florence that I began jotting down my impressions of Santayana in a diary and forming , I believe , a more adequate conception of the man himself and his way of life . I lived at his hotel and so had a good opportunity of observing him " at home . " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To begin with , he dressed extremely simply . He had two black suits , a winter and a spring overcoat , and three pairs of shoes ( I am excluding an old pair of evening pumps that Santayana had purchased in Boston over forty years ago and still wore occasionally ) . If you add to this a black felt hat , half a dozen white shirts , and two black tics , you have almost his entire wardrobe . The economy of life was manifested in the simple and long-established routine of his day . He would arise at seven in the morning , slip on an old dressing gown , a pair of socks and slippers , and then breakfast ha the sitting room at precisely seven-thirty . This meal consisted of tea and toast and a soft-boiled egg . At eight o'clock he would go to his desk , wrap an old rug around his legs to keep him warm , and after glancing at his correspondence , start working in earnest . He would write steadily until half past eleven . Then Ile would have his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I usually turned up about noon , and read his London Morning Post in the sitting room until he had completed his toilet . If the weather was fair , and it generally is in Rome in spring , we would walk to a near-by restaurant for luncheon . And here Santayana would " let himself go " to a certain extent : I mean there was nothing especially abstemious exemplified in his choice of food . He would often order a dish that struck me as being rather rich , such as a spicy Indian curry or an elaborate cake for dessert . And he drank two or three glasses of wine ? a mezw-litre ? with his food . ( It astonished me the way he poured leftover wine on his cake when the dessert was served . ) After luncheon he would go for a walk in the Pincio . He preferred as a rule to be alone in the afternoon , now that there were no new sights for us to see in Rome . I frequently spied him in the park reading his newspaper , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pincio is full of lovely promenades . He would return to his hotel about four-thirty , put on his slippers and dressing gown , and either read a book or attend to his correspondence ? but would do no more serious writing . Around six o'clock I would drop in for a chat . I say chat , but some of my most personal conversations with Santayana occurred during this brief half hour or so before dinner was served in his sitting room . I never dined with him : I had my dinner downstairs in the hotel restaurant . To complete this bare description of a typical day in the life of my friend , it only remains to add that he read until about ten o'clock before retiring . In my mind 's eye I can see him walk over to the large front window that opened on the Piazza Barberini , and gaze for a few moments up the lighted Via Triton ? before drawing the curtains for the night . Santayana liked that view from his top-story window : it was gay and yet sufficiently distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physically above the traffic of this world . I remember how it impressed me when I discovered that Santayana would never read any notices or criticisms of his work ? unless some old friend happened to send him a clipping . He detested the solicitations of literary agencies . Middleton Murry has wisely said that Santayana 's detachment is a condition of clear thinking , but other less friendly critics have put it clown to a dread of contamination ? or perhaps ultimate snobbery . Whatever way you look at it , the fact remains that he lived above the popular movements in the intellectual world . Santayana is said to be reluctant to meet people , and it is rumored that he has dropped many casual acquaintances who have mistaken themselves for friends . It can not be denied that he has manifested a certain dread of interruption , for that is what the imputation of being unsocial boils down to in his case . His dread of interruption is grounded on a practical consideration . Santayana was over sixty when I first net him . There were still a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were burning brightly . And he had to protect the daily routine that had been devised expressly for this purpose . There were a few people who came from time to time for luncheon , students or professors for the most part . And sometimes I helped Santayana in a very practical way , for after luncheon he would excuse himself , but suggest that I should go in hisstead for a walk with the disappointed student or professor . I became callous to the stony silence or rather forced conversation that usually resulted from this expedient . Of course there were a few older friends of long standing that Santayana welcomed in a different spirit every five years or so ? old Harvard friends like Lawrence Smith Butler or Horace Kellen . And the late Lady Russell ( " Elizabeth " ) used to write him when she was to be in Rome . 7 SOMETIME in June , 1932 , after I had at last returned to London , I received a long letter from Santayana . He said that he required my material assistance again ( The Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and offered to support me indefinitely . I had been making a little money doing book reviews and occasional articles for English literary periodicals , but it was a relief to know there would be something more regular to depend on . In his letter Santayana also wrote me that , despite his long absence from the classroom and lecture hall , he had consented to deliver two final public ad. dresses ? one in Holland and one in England . He first went to The Hague in August for the commemoration of the tercentenary of the birth of Spinoza , and read a remarkable paper on " Ultimate Re . ligion . " Then , early in September , he crossed the Channel for the first time since World War I and came to London . I had engaged rooms for him just off St. James 's Street in the quarter he knew so well . His object in coming to London had been to fulfill a long-delayed promise made to the Royal Society of Literature when they had honored him with their gold medal some years before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paper when you receive the gold medal , but Santayana had been in Rome at the time and was excused on the promise that he would deliver an address at some future date . So he had decided to kill two birds on one round trip in 1932 , and follow up his Spinoza lecture by giving one on " John Locke and the Frontiers of Common Sense " in London . One of the first things Santayana did in London was to buy a gray hat , an umbrella , and a raincoat , in the Burlington Arcade . Although I assured him that many people in England wore black felt hats , he insisted that he would look less conspicuous in a gray one . We lead luncheon every day at Hatchett 's ? that charming old restaurant in Piccadilly that Santayana had frequented before the turn of the century . Then we would go for a long walk around the Serpentine in Hyde Park . I enjoyed very much being with Santayana in London , but he was not happy the:re himself . He thought the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He asked me not to tell any of his old friends that ho bad returned to England . If they should discover his presence by some accident , well , that was fate and he would accept the consequences . I think Santayana felt his age more in England than anywhere else . He had been there as a younger man and all during the First World War , and he regarded England as a segment of his past , a green and distant episode in his life , that could not now be revived or added to with any spiritual profit . His heart was in Rome and he told me frankly that he was " longing to go back there . " But there was first this business of his lecture to be attended to . Although his address on Locke was well received ( the applause was loud and sustained at the end ) , Santayana himself was far from pleased with his performance . To begin with , he had been rather exasperated by the distinguished old windbag who introduced him . A more distressing feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inexcusable fact that there was no light over or evert near his rostrum , and he had to hold his manuscript at an angle to catch the flickering daylight from a distant window . But despite this handicap , the fatuous chairman , and the fact that lie had been out of practice for so long , lie did very well . His voice was low and deliberate and eloquent ; and his perfect accent , so free of anything adventitious or local , with nothing of Oxford or Boston in it , surprised his audience . They had not expected a " foreigner " to speak so well . Personally , I have never heard anyone speak a purer English than Santayana : it is impossible to place him geographically by his pronunciation . I can well believe that his lectures were a daily delight to his pupils at Harvard . The day after his lecture , Santayana left for Dover . He remained there for a few days until the Channel was reported to be calm ( he has always dreaded and suffered from seasickness ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during his brief stop in Dover he had found time to revisit Canterbury and to revive some old impressions . 8 IT HAD not been Santayana 's intention to publish The Last Puritan during his lifetime . But when his publishers got wind of the fact that the manuscript was nearly ready by the summer of 1934 , they naturally clamored for the right to publish it as soon as possible . Santayana could not make up his mind what to do . He never for a moment entertained the idea that the book might become a howling success ; his only concern was to keep it on as high a level as possible , so that his friends would not think that he had made a mistake in turning novelist for a season . I remember his saying to me : " I do n't care a hang what the general public think of the book , as long as my friends ? both personal and in the spirit ? do n't feel that I was foolish to attempt such a thing at all . " In other words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , discriminating audience for which it was written . But before telling his publishers definitely that he would comply with their wishes , he wrote me a letter in August  --  I was summering in Sussex , England ? and said he would be happier if I road the manuscript and told him frankly just what I thought of it , " It will help me to make up my mind about publishing it now , " he wrote , " if I know the reaction of a normal , representative human being to my novel . " When I received the manuscript sometime in the autumn , I read through The Last Puritan quickly in order to get a general impression before setting to work on it in detail . And it was obvious to me at once that here was an opportunity to be of help . In the first place , I spotted immediately a good many phrases or expressions that impressed me as being old-fashioned and stilted . For example , Santayana , wishing to state that Oliver was going for a swim , would describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suggested that a " dip " or " plunge " would probably do the business as well as his own way of putting it . On a somewhat larger scale of criticism , I later came to feel that one or two themes had been sufficiently developed in certain chapters , and that they tended to lose their original force by being reintroduced and emphasized in other directions . So I sent the manuscript back to Rome with all my suggestions carefully typed out . In about a fortnight I heard from Santayana , and he wrote that lie was studying my " commentaries " with interest , but preferred to defer the question of revising his book until I arrived in Rome on my annual spring visit . It was always with the keenest pleasure that I looked forward to returning to Italy and visiting Santayana , and this time I was more excited than usual , for I was eager to hear from his own lips what he thought of my " commentaries . " Although I arrived in Rome rather late on a March evening , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still up , and he must have felt my eagerness to talk about The Last Puritan , for he put his hand on my shoulder and said : " Cory , I do n't want to discuss the novel this evening . But I will tell you that I have decided to accept nearly all your suggestions . " I was immensely flattered and relieved . And to this day I feel that it was magnanimous of Santayana to admit openly that I could help him to such an extent . Of course he knew that my suggestions were not those of a carping critic , but perfectly spontaneous . And that , I believe , is why ho sometimes accepted them . I told him candidly that I expected his novel would have a " quiet success , " but that I doubted very much if its appeal would be popular or lasting . He fully agreed with me . Sometime early in April , Strong turned up in Rome . Because he had little to do and was extremely curious about The Last Puritan , Santayana gave him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being amused by the characters depicted against their New England background , Strong solemnly explained that some of Santayana 's old friends and relations in Boston might be " hurt and offended " by the " hasty caricature " of their psychological traits and social setting . As I have never considered Santayana an indiscreet person , I urged him to disregard these admonitions . So , despite Strong 's solemn strictures , the manuscript of The Last Puritan was duly revised and sent off to Constable in London . It first came out in England in the autumn of 1935 and was well received . As usual , the Sunday Times and the Observer made a new book by Santayana the subject of their leading book reviews . But it was hardly an outstanding literary event . One did not feel that a reading of The Last Puritan was an intellectual duty to be performed at all costs ; it was simply a matter of interest that a well-known philosopher could write a charming , if somewhat involved , novel . The enormous success of The Last Puritan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its peculiar mass psychology . Granting that the novel had been accepted by the Bookof-the-Month Club and was enthusiastically and fully reviewed , and that Santayana has a considerable reputation in America outside of the purely literary and philosophical circles , I fail to see how the general interest and appeal of The Last Puritan , as a novel , could have been sufficient to make it the top fiction best-seller for many weeks . Perhaps I am entirely mistaken . Perhaps in the character of Oliver many a sober reader has found a ghost of his own soul-searchings , or in that of Mario a vicarioussatisfaction of a secret desire to be perfectly at home in the world of nature and society . As for Santayana himself , his reaction to the reception of his novel was typical . When I visited him in 1936 , the excitement over the book had somewhat abated in the United States , although it was still selling well . " How does it feel to be a famous novelist ? " I asked him . " I do n't like it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the first place , it 's the last thing in the world that Oliver would have desired ; in the second place , I do n't need the money ; and lastly , I 'm bothered to death with letters from the most remote quarters fan mail , ' I believe they call it . Just look at that huge parcel over there ! " Santayana was really pleased with the success of his novel , but I think that he turned to the writing of The Realm of Truth with a sense of relief a few months later . He was eager to forget the furore over The Last Puritan . 9 SANTAYANA was by now over seventy , and although he would still walk two or three miles a day after luncheon , the desire to get back to his rooms and put on his slippers was increasing . When Santayana was well rested , in the morning , or just after dinner , the sparkle of his conversation was as bright and entertaining as ever ; but he had become extremely careful to reserve his best hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss philosophical questions during his " off hours . " For this reason , the intermittent visits of Strong to Rome used to worry him more and more . Despite the fact that they would both formally agree beforehand not to discuss philosophy , and Santayana would gladly live up to his part of the contract , it was literally impossible for Strong ( because of his ruling passion ) to avoid " turning on epistemology " ? as one might the radiator or the radio . And this would inevitably lead to bitterness and dismay . The bitterness was Strong 's , because he was unable to convince Santayana of the soundness of his " latest view " on some minute issue , or to persuade his old friend to reconsider the advisability of revising the entire Realms of Being . The dismay was Santayana 's , because he could think of no way , short of a complete rupture of relations , of postponing these unhappy meetings . If it had not been for certain admirable qualities in Strong , the situation might have been more difficult . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search for the Truth , if narrow and tinged by fanaticism , was unflagging , and he was a most learned person . For example , he read Greek and Latin easily , and knew and spoke fluently both French and German . And his retentive memory was extraordinary . I was amazed at his knowledge of historical events and dates , and at the ease with which he traced some out-of-the-way quotation to its remote source . As an illustration of Strong 's moral character when a matter of principle was at stake , I shall never forget his firm attitude whom , in May , 1937 , Hitler visited Mussolini in Italy . On the day when the two dictators were due to drive through the streets of Florence , all hotels and private residences were ordered to hang out their flags in honor of the occasion . But Strong resolutely refused to do so . Although the authorities several times telephoned his villa and demanded angrily that he comply with the order issued , and his servants literally begged him to , he turned a deaf ear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather be fined or go to prison than show any respect for Hitler 's visit . And when one remembers his age and physical condition , I think he showed remarkable courage . Unfortunately , not all of his compatriots in Italy were so exemplary in their behavior. 10 TIE clouds were gathering over Europe , and the sense of something ominous , dark and inescapable , was growing on all sides . I felt it especially in Paris . Even the casual visitor know that the old holiday spirit had gone and had given place to a kind of fatal indifference born of internal division ? a spiritual incapacity to alter the course of events . People shrugged their shoulders , spoke of the Maginot Line , and ordered some more wine . Santayana was just finishing one of the most abstract and technical of his books ? The Realm of Truth . I had been with him for a while in Paris in the summer ( I forget what prompted him to return there instead of to the mountains ) , and of course we had discussed the international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was not going to be any war . " This is the war now , " he said to me . " I mean this diplomatic feeling out of each other ? these veiled threats and important questions of prestige . But I do n't think any blows will be struck on a large scale . " Santayana remained indoors most of the day , working over his manuscript . For this reason hemissed to a certain extent the general tension in Paris . For it was not unusual to come across a heated argument in a caf6 , or to see fists suddenly raised on the boulevards between members of the Front Populaire and the various right-wing parties such as the Croix de Feu . It was only in the evenings , when I talked with Santayana , that I managed to forget the impact of the external world . As usual he was relieved that another book was nearly ready for the publishers . And the period of gestation had been rather trying in the case of The Realm of Truth . Santayana has an intuitive rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusions from premises does not come easily to him . I shall never forget those months in Europe before the war finally broke out . In the spring of 1939 , Strong had become apprehensive over remaining in Italy , and had moved suddenly to Vevey in Switzerland to await developments . As Strong was by now very feeble , and certain to be less comfortable in a hotel than in his own home , Santayana urged me to forgo my customary visit to Rome , and go instead to Vevey to keep our friend company . Switzerland was an ideal center from which to experience the feverish pulse beats of a nerve-wracked Europe : I found the Swiss newspapers in close touch with everything and their editorials admirably objective . Both Strong and I were uneasy about Santayana in Italy , and finally we persuaded him to cons ( der the idea of coming to Switzerland for the summer . Of course Strong was not motivated solely by his desire to have Santayana reach a haven of safety : he wanted one more chance to discuss philosophy with him before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that he had made up his mind to come to Switzerland , it was Lugano rather than Vevey that he chose for his place of residence . As I have his letters from April , 1939 , until Pearl Harbor , let me quote him directly : ? Roue , June 3 , 1030 DEAR CORY , I have decided to go to Lugano and make myself as comfortable as possible , having a sitting room ( but I shall go down to meals ) and living all day in pyjamas , as I am too old for basking on beaches . There is bathing at Lugano , which you might like if you come to see me . I now seek warmth ( if there are no flies and mosquitoes ) and besides have an eye to a place that might suit me the year round , and Lugano might be the spot . Also it is Catholic and Italian fundamentally , so that it will be more human than Vevey or Cortina . I hope you will be tempted to look me up , but you must do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you what is the best way of getting around , but the northern all-Swiss route by the St. Gothard would be , I should think , very picturesque and would avoid customs and changes of money . I may eventually thread that path myself and go to Glion , if I find Lugano unbearably hot or otherwise objectionable . I am glad you see your way clear in Dewey Santayana had sent me Dewey 's Logic after embellishing it with his fascinating margin-notes , and in reaching Lugano was due to an unfortunate complication he had not foreseen . As a rule visas were not necessary for foreigners in crossing the Swiss frontiers , and Santayana had assumed that his Spanish passport was perfectly in order . To his dismay when he arrived at Chiasso he was refused permission to enter Switzerland . After traveling all the way back to Milan , he learned from the Swiss consulate there that he could procure only a temporary visa , good for two weeks , if he wished to go to Switzerland . Apparently a considerable number of destitute Spanish communists had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just been passed to prevent any further financial embarrassment to the Swiss government . Santayana did not argue long with the Swiss consulate at Milan . A few days later I heard from him that he had decided to return to his old mountain retreat at Cortina d'Ampezzo , and I answered that I would visit him there in August . Santayana had always found Cortina d'Ampezzo a good spot for working in the summer , and two months of high altitude helped to increase his resistance to those severe bronchial attacks that often troubled him during the winter . The Ampezzo valley lies in the heart of the majestic but hellish Dolomites , and the town of Cortina ? " The Little Court " ? is decidedly more Austrian than Italian . The simple mountain folk were extremely courteous , and if it had not been for the rich Italian visitors and the intermittent appearance of the same cheap German tourists coming up from Venice to gulp the air for a few hours and find everything wunderbar , one might have forgotten for a while the awful shape of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person in Cortina that summer , and it was most disconcerting to be constantly slapped on the back and " boiled " in the village stores or cafes . But if you did not look Italian it was assumed that you must be German . Of course Santayana was by now fully aware of the immediate danger of war , but after his unhappyexperience at the Swiss frontier , ho had virtually decided to stick it out in Italy , come what may . Above all he was determined to finish The Realist of Spirit ? the last volume of his philosophical tetralogy ? as quickly as possible . " I have been occupied with the Realms of Being for sixteen years , " he told me , " and I should like to complete my task this winter . As long as I can get my money from the United States , I am prepared to put up with the inevitable hardships that are part and parcel of every great war . You must remember that I was in England all through the last one . " Santayana gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And from the first I felt that The Realm of Spirit was to he most personal philosophical book . This may seem like a paradox when we discover that its theme ( I almost said message ) is an examination of the spiritual possibility of conquering the engrossments of the personal self in a precarious competitive world . But if the single desire of certain men at certain periods of history has always been to transcend the limitations of the self and live ? as we put it in religious phraseology ? " in the Presence of God , " it would be true to say that this desire , this pure flame , was the most characteristic , the most personal thing about them . There is something so timeless , so above a mere planetary disturbance , about Santayana 's philosophy that it is difficult for most of us today to attain the composure necessary for a just appreciation of his work . We are more concerned with saving our skins than with the inner education of the spiritual life . And if the material conditions of democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to practice an intellectual domination of fatality in a concentration camp . In the meantime , when the flame of the spirit is pure , It suffices that its light should fall on things steadfast and true , worthy to be discerned and returned to and treasured ; so that though spirit be everywhere halting in achievement , it may be always perfect in allegiance . I remained with Santayana in Cortina until the end of August , but he then urged me to return to England immediately . He knew that practically all my personal belongings were in London and that Italy might not be very congenial for an American if hostilities broke out . I can see him now as he came down the steps of the hotel to bid me good-bye . " All being well , " he said , " we shall meet again sometime next year . Bon , voyage . " I have not seen my friend since that day .
