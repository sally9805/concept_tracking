txt on surface vessels . Fish and Wildlife Service officials believe it will be possible not only to locate schools of fish , but even to determine the size and direction of the schools . Arrangements are under way between the Office of the Coordinator of Fisheries and the Navy for a full-scale test - of the devices on surface vessels . according to Coordinator Harold I. Ickes . Tests will be made in waters off California as soon as certain security regulations can be complied with . As a current part of the equipment of naval patrol vessels , the devices are believed the world 's finest . and far superior to those in use just before the war . Experiments have already been made in sighting schools of fish from naval patrol blimps . but this method is effective only for about three hours of each day . when reflections do not interfere with detection . Echo-sounders can operate 24 hours a day in all weather .

Some modern fishing vessels use echo or depth-sounders to locate the ocean bottom . and they have been of great value to vessels engaged in fishing for " bottom fish " which swim along the ocean floor . They protect nets from rocks , and locate undersea valleys where such fish congregate . The chief purpose of experiments now being planned is to aid fishermen to catch pilchards , or California sardines . The pilchard season closed last week , and officials hope that experiments will enable effective use of the devices by the time the next season openS : August 1 . The pilchard is traditionally caught during the " dark of the moon . " as is the case with certain other schooling fish , since in disturbing the minute organisms in surface waters they " phosphoresce " and thus show their presence Such a method of locating the pilchard can be followed only about half each month , whereas the new scientific system would make daylight fishing lucrative as night-time operations .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
