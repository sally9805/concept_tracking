In the week following the Ford and Chrysler wage settlements , not a single other important agreement was reached between labor and management . The steel strike entered its third week , the General Motors strike its third month . <P> Even so , there was no violence , hardly even a rise in tempers . In Pittsburgh , a judge issued an injunction limiting pickets at Carnegie-Illinois ' Homestead plant to ten at each gate . The union protested , but obeyed . In Manhattan , Novelist Elizabeth Janeway ( The Walsh Girls ) formed a committee to raise funds for G.M. strikers , got $35,000 in three days from a heterogeneous list of contributors who agreed with the slogan " Hunger Must Not ' Be a Weapon . " The committee promptly began sending the money out to buy food and pay rents . In New York , the city 's Welfare Department agreed to aid Western Union strikers who were in need . <P> G.M. and the United Auto Workers were brought together again by labor conciliator James F. Dewey , an old hand at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a stumbling block . Day after day the headlines radiated optimism , but there were few facts on which to base it . <P> The scene had shifted to Washington . The issue now was prices . <P> Change of Opponents . By now Harry Truman was firmly committed to wage increases of 18 to 19 an hour . Labor , all down the line , had accepted the President 's figure . The battle was now joined between Government and industry on how high prices should go to compensate for the wage increases . Harry Truman had not long to wait to hear industry 's side . <P> Irving S. Olds , board chairman of United States Steel , stepped up to demand a steel price increase " greatly in excess of $6.25 a ton . " ( The Government had been willing to agree to $4 . ) <P> Henry Ford II , having committed his company to a wage increase of 18 an hour , called for the abolition of all automobile price controls . Said he : " Nobody wants runaway inflation . Inflation grows out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Administration , at first divided on policy , was busy talking itself into a compromise . All week long Harry Truman conferred with OWMR Boss John Snyder and Stabilization Administrator John Caskie Collet , who leaned toward the theory of increased prices to get production going . Then the President summoned ( from a Southern vacation ) Price Boss Chester Bowles , who was determined to hold the line . <P> Emerging from a 45-minute White House conference , Chester Bowles was mum . But two days later he was back at the White House ; rumors of his resignation suddenly died down . <P> Chester Bowles had apparently been persuaded to go along with a steel price rise now ( some said it would be about $6 a ton ) , with the promise that he would get full backing to hold the price line in the future . In effect , he had been given the assignment of working out with John Snyder a new price-wage structure-at a higher level .                  @ @ @
