" Hitler was a baby compared with this gang , " said ECAdministrator Paul Hoffman last week , in language that was tough even in an era of tough talk . " I do n't think the American people have this world conflict in focus . . . Let 's talk about it for what it is-an attempt by the gang in the Politburo to take over the world . . . If you have been out in Asia ... it gives you the heebie-jeebies . " <P> Relatively few Americans had been out to Asia , and few had the heebie-jeebies over it . The new Truman budget ( see above ) cut the China aid program to ribbons . Last week one man did speak out firmly , and he spoke out firmly even if many Americans regarded the whole subject of China as something to be swept beneath the rug and ignored . <P> Tenacious William C. Bullitt , Franklin Roosevelt 's onetime ambassador to Moscow and Paris , had been sent to China by a congressional committee to check on U.S. aid to China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco 's ex-Mayor Roger Lapham , " for the excellent work it has done . " But Bullitt was firmly convinced that U.S. economic and military aid would delay , but not prevent further Communist advances . <P> Wanted : A Fighting General . Was there still time to save China ? Yes , said Bill Bullitt , if the U.S. really wanted to , and really went at it , i.e. , if the U.S. were actually to take over the war against the Chinese Communists . <P> The Chinese soldier , when well-trained , well-fed and well-led , is as good as any , Bullitt reported . But , he said , many of the top-ranking officers are both incompetent and dishonest . Therefore , to turn the tide of the war in China , Bullitt said , requires American direction and control , exercised by " a fighting general of the highest qualities , with an adequate staff of able officers . " He thought that General Douglas MacArthur could do the job quickest . But he also mentioned as prospects , General Mark W. Clark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collins . He called for the revival of the volunteer " Flying Tigers , " and urged Congress to appropriate $800,000,000 for China , chiefly in military aid . <P> If the Dike Falls . Concluded Bullitt : " The dike which today prevents the Communist flood from sweeping southward to the Indian Ocean is the line of the Yangtze River in China . It is a formidable obstacle ... If the dike of the Yangtze falls , we shall let in upon ourselves a sea of troubles in comparison with which our present problems in the Far East will seem a mere unpleasant puddle . . . We do have to recognize that we are at one of the turning points of human history , and that we can not afford to be wrong in our decisions , since the stake may be not only the independence of China but also the independence of the United States .
