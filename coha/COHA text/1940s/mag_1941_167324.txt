The impelling needs of defense last week drove the U.S. Government into the aluminum business . Jesse Jones 's RFC arranged to put up $250,000,000 for new aluminum plants . They will be owned by the Government , operated by three private companies ( Aluminum Co. of America , Reynolds Metals Co. , Bohn Aluminum &; Brass Corp . ) . <P> Reason was that all concerned , having badly under-guessed aluminum requirements ( TIME , May 26 ) , now recognized that what had been done before was not enough . RFC had already put up money for Reynolds to build two plants in competition with Alcoa . Its near-monopoly gone or going , Alcoa depended heavily on Government electricity from TVA and Bonneville Dam for additional new plants of its own . Resultant U.S. capacity ( by 1943 ) : 700,000 tons a year , probably not enough for military needs , let alone civilian and semimilitary requirements . <P> What made additional aluminum capacity absolutely necessary was a decision to expand big-bomber production . RFC last week set aside $350,000,000 to finance new bomber plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make bombers . At the belated best , Mr. Jones 's Government-owned aluminum plants may be operating by late 1942 ( if they can be rapidly tooled , if sufficient power can be found , if enough bauxite-now mostly imported by Alcoa from Surinam-is at hand ) . <P> Bombers also take a lot of magnesium alloys . U.S. magnesium production in 1940 : 13,000,000 lb . Jones 's RFC last week stepped farther into this field as well , put up $50,000,000 to build new Government-owned magnesium plants ' However the supply of such vital military materials may fare this year and next , defense is already changing the industrial face of the U.S.
