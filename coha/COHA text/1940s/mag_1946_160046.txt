Cried Dr. Joseph Charles of Haiti : " Fraternity ! Luminous entity which comes out of the flame and the heat , may you enlighten this august assembly . . . so that the structure of the future should never take the form of tombs . . . . " <P> There was indeed a faint glimmer of enlightenment over the U.N . ' s General Assembly last week , and more than an occasional flicker of fraternity . All the week 's major subjects were old quarrels , inevitably disinterred , but the U.N . Assemblymen approached them with new determination to have another go at the world 's endless agenda of discord . <P> Spain . In his initial report , Secretary General Trygve Lie bluntly said he hoped that U.N . would " find ways and means by which liberty . . . may be restored in Spain . " The Russians were obviously pleased , and no other important delegation hurried to object . Argentina 's Jose Arce obliquely defended Franco by urging caution against " any downfall in the old-established human societies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Field Marshal Jan Christian Smuts sponsored a request that South-West Africa be incorporated in his South African Union , the Indian delegation , led by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru 's sister , silver-haired Mrs. Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit , accused South Africa of persecuting its Indian minority . In the Assembly 's General ( Steering ) Committee , Smuts , already harassed by domestic troubles ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) , argued that the Indian minority question was an internal <P> South African affair . Russia 's Andrei Vishinsky countered that the minority dispute concerned all nations . Vishinsky insisted that the South-West Africa question be excluded from discussion . After the U.S. 's new chief delegate , Senator Warren Austin , watchfully assisted by Adviser John C. Ross ( whom one newsman called the delegation 's " invisible quarterback " ) , made a placatory speech , Vishinsky withdrew his objections . <P> The Veto . A group of small nations , led by Cuba and Australia , demanded that the Assembly take a stand for modification of the Big Five veto in the Security Council . Since Russia has used the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other nation has invoked it ) , the Russian delegation naturally was dead set against debating the proposal . The Ukraine 's Dmitri Manuilsky charged that the small nations were scattering " apples of discord . " <P> On the day that the General Committee was expected to act on the veto , both Austin and Vishinsky arrived early . In a corner of the committee room they talked earnestly through their interpreters . Later , Vishinsky reversed his stand , declared that Russia would not oppose discussion of the matter by the Assembly . The Russians were not taking any risk ; Vishinsky knew Austin would not support drastic changes in the veto power . <P> Everyone agreed that the new Russian attitude was wonderful , and spoke quietly so as not to disturb it . Even Turkey 's Huseyin Ragip Baydur only indirectly referred to Russian demands on the Dardanelles by growling that " arms and military might are powerful but world opinion is far more important .
