Admiral Nicholas Horthy , Regent of Hungary , and his clique of aristocratic Magyar officials had long sought to regain for their country some of its vanished power and glory . From the ceiling-high windows of their brownstone government building in Pest they surveyed Buda spread out in a quiet arc . They looked down the sluggish Danube , past the austere statue of their patron , Saint Stephen , and felt themselves ordained and inevitable monarchs of all they saw and all they could take . <P> Opportunism had paid dividends in 1940 when , by playing Germany 's game , they had taken the long disputed province of Transylvania from Rumania . Germany bought their crops and paid for them . The collapse of Yugoslavia further . strengthened Hungary . Magyar counts strode haughtily along the Danube confident that Budapest would soon be capital of Southeastern Europe , a strong and respected buffer between Berlin and Rome , guardian of the status quo from the Black Sea to the Adriatic . <P> But the New Order proved a disappointment . By the end of 1942 Hungary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at war with three of the world 's most powerful countries-which seemed quite a lot to a nation the size of Maine . Hungarian armies were being cut to pieces a thousand miles away in Russia . Hungarian workers were herded into boxcars and shipped off to Germany . The people were war-weary and disillusioned . Berlin blackmailed Budapest into sending more troops to the eastern front by threatening to give Transylvania back to Rumania . <P> The Magyar counts and the Admiral stared despondently from their high windows and saw Europe and its New Order disintegrating . They saw ahead more dull , humiliating months as errand boys to Hitler , then fine chances for insurrection and chaos . They wondered what they could do about it . <P> Allied successes in North Africa gave them ideas . The Magyars went to work . Last week they ordered 20,000 Hungarian workers home from Germany by year 's end . Berlin , angry , warned that the departing Hungarians could take no money out of the Reich . But the German mark no longer meant as much as it had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning and seemed to have got away with it . Hope returned to Admiral Horthy . After all , Jean Franois Darlan was an Admiral too .
