Spade-bearded Ivan Mestrovic is a man who puts strong feelings into his sculpture ( TIME , Aug. 30 , 1948 ) , and has plenty left over when he has laid aside his mallet . Last week Mestrovic received an urgent invitation to return to Yugoslavia , where he was born and made his fame . The invitation came through Fellow Sculptor Jo Davidson , who had recently completed a bust of Marshal Tito , and it was from the Dictator himself . " Tell Mestrovic , " Tito had said , " not to be a fool . Tell him to come back . " The expatriate sculptor 's blunt reply : " Too many of my friends are in jail over there . " <P> Mestrovic , who now teaches at Syracuse University , added that the Yugoslav ambassador also had been urging him to return , if only for a visit . " He said that if I wished I could go incognito . But I will go to Belgrade incognito only when Tito goes to Moscow incognito . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
