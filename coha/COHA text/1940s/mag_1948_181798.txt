" The villain threatens to flog the half-naked heroine . . . . The beautiful girl is beaten to death on a sacrificial altar . . The men are stabbed and have their arms , legs and heads cut off . . . . The bride is kidnaped . . . . Fists that smash against faces settle all problems . " <P> These are typical scenes from the so-called " comic books . " What is such stuff doing to the minds of U.S. children ? Determined to find out , the Association for the Advancement of Psychotherapy last week held a symposium in Manhattan on " The Psychopathology of Comic <P> Books . " Specialists were asked to give their views . <P> Manhattan Folklorist Gershon Legman , author of a historical treatise on comic books , showed the psychiatrists some grisly samples and presented some shuddery statistics . Every year 500,000,000 comic books are printed ; the average city child reads ten to a dozen a month . If there is only one scene of violence a page , this gives him a diet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torture and blood per month . " Every city child who was six years old in 1938 has by now , Legman figured , " absorbed an absolute minimum of 18,000 pictorial beatings , shootings , stranglings , blood puddles and torturings-to-death from comic books alone . " * <P> A diagnosis was offered by Dr. Frederic Wertham , Manhattan psychiatrist and founder of Harlem 's Lafargue Clinic ( TIME , Dec. i ) . The increase of violence in juvenile delinquency , he said , goes hand in hand with the increase of comic books . Said Dr. Wertham : " We are getting to the roots of one of the contributing causes of juvenile delinquency . . . . You can not understand present-day juvenile delinquency if you do not take into account the pathogenic and pathoplastic influence of the comic books . " In plainer language : comic books not only inspire evil but suggest a form for the evil to take . <P> <P> *The young may also pick up a few ideas from such old-fashioned sources as fairy tales ( in Hansel &; Gretel , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myths ( Perseus decapitates a lady who stands in his way ) , Bible stories ( little David gives Goliath a hole in the head ) .
