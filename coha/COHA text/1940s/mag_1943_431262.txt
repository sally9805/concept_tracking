War is a frightening occupation for our soldiers . On every front they must be prepared not only to take what the enemy has in the way of terror , but to dish it out in bigger and stronger doses . It 's a fearsome job for young men whose nearest approach to violence once was to shout , " Kill the umpire ! " But great camouflaged transports are  | carrying these young men in increasing numbers to the war zones . Many already have passed months in battle sectors where all the furies of modern warfare rage . Blasting , strafing dive-bombers have howled out of a foreign sun to slice the air over their foxholes . Unholy screams of wings and motors and bombs have torn at their eardrums . Shattered rocks and flying stone have added to the threat of shrapnel . They have known lack of food and water , the tenseness of the zero hour , the sight of friends and comrades being killed and wounded before their eyes . These former bookkeepers , clerks , farmers , and factory hands are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes little difference what outfit they 're with ? infantry , tanks , tank-busters , air forces , paratroops , engineers ? they feel the fury of it . Some have cracked under the terrific strain . Authentic reports show that nearly one third of the first casualties shipped back were mental and nervous cases . But the fight goes on , with veterans , replacements , and fresh troops carrying the battle to the enemy . Army officers are confident that our men have the stuff needed for victory . Some of that confidence stems from the belief that our soldiers have the finest and most modern equipment in the world ; some comes from the knowledge that they are excellently trained , know how to use their weapons ; some springs from proof of their great physical stamina , and some comes from the historical fact that American soldiers have yet to lose a war . But a factor not to be overlooked is the Army 's remarkable new program to combat fear and mental instability . For this is responsible to a large degree for our success in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ induction centers to training camps to battle areas , our soldiers are feeling the effects of the program . It 's helping them to withstand the pressure of Army life on minds , nerves , and emotions . It 's assisting them to be competent , dependable , courageous ; and it 's untangling minds that have become twisted by the stresses of war . This is the first time that such an effort has been made on a large scale . Employed only in rudimentary form late in World War I , the process was started last year with the creation of a neuropsychiatric branch in the Surgeon General 's Office in Washington . Then followed the opening of a unique school in Lawsen General Hospital , Atlanta , Ga. , in which in 196 hours of classes young Medical Corps officers are being fitted for the special service . Selected with great care by Col. Roy D. Halloran , chief of the branch , and ranking Medical Corps psychiatrists , they are a , - signed after graduation to one of the nine Army commands in this country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the direction of the new neuropsychiatric centers established in the European and South Pacific theaters . Personnel and morale officers , chaplains . and field officers assist the psychiatrists in the program . Never before has there been such co-ordination of effort to improve soldiering and make it more palatable . The psychiatrists not only watch and help individual soldiers , but they seek to create conditions wherein the stresses are minimized . They help devise means of relaxation and entertainment . They live with the troops , experience their difficulties , and help to solve them . Colonel Halloran says of them : " They are specially trained medical confidants , with a real desire and ability to help . " But even more than that , these new friends of our soldiers stand as a safeguard against one of the worst tragedies of battle ? the thousands of war-induced mental cases that usually occur .

It 's at the front that the supreme test for the Army 's program comes . That 's the scene for the all-out fight against fear . By that time the soldier has learned many things about the science of war and wants to use that knowledge to blast the enemy . But his eagerness is mixed with dread and fright . The first time he goes into battle , he 's apt to be downright scared . His throat becomes dry ; his stomach feels like flipping , and his heart does a dance macabre under his khaki tunic . And that may be true every time he gets within striking distance of the enemy But he must learn to control his fear .

Fear , as demoralizing and uncomfortable as it may be , actually is the body 's preparation for action . The heart beats faster , pumping blood to the arms , legs , and brain where oxygen is needed . Quickened breathing is the part of the lungs . Blood pressure goes up , and adrenalin , nature 's " shot in the arm , " pours liberally into the blood stream . Sugar is released as fuel for the human fighting machine . That 's the normal reaction during the frightening moments just before an attack .

That 's why there is so much importance attached to keeping fear under control ? conquering it . The Army has six ways to fight fear . For men facing that greatest period of tenseness ? just before the zero hour ? the slogan is : " Work ? do anything ? but keep busy . " Action relieves stress on minds and nerves . Troops under fire should keep in contact with comrades , if that is at all possible . Just the presence of another Clan not far off helps quiet fear . Calling the roll is helpful . It reminds the  | men that they are part of a close-knit organization , not facing the dangers alone . Great reassurance comes with knowledge that every man is in his place , despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounts . Another important remedy against fear , strange as it seems , is to keep soldiers informed of the odds confronting them . Officers are urged to keep in mind that knowledge is power over fear . Men posted on the dangers , the kind of weapons they 're up against , and the size of the enemy 's force are far less susceptible to fear . Soldiers are taught that to be afraid does n't mean they must act afraid . Since fear is contagious when it is expressed by action , men who become panicky must be removed from the sight of other men . It is the soldier 's responsibility to control signs of his own fear if he can , so as to spare his comrades . Fighting men have learned that the very effort often reduces fear and brings calmness . Soldiers are acquainted with statistics on the percentage of casualties in action . That is reassuring . For , according to figures on even the bitterest fights , comparatively few men are killed , and the chances that any one man will be among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Army knows that courage and fear are not opposites ? that they may be possessed by a soldier at the same time . But the soldier who has courage need not worry about his feeling of fright . He 'll keep that under control . In the words of the National Research Council : " None but the brave can afford fear . " In talks that I have had with some of our wounded soldiers brought back from the war zones for treatment in the Army 's great Walter Reed Hospital , in Washington , it was interesting to note how few admitted having experienced fear . One chap , who has been decorated with the Silver Star for distinguished service in North Africa , summed it up by saying : " Hell , we were too busy to get scared . " His citation said that , although painfully wounded , he had pushed forward , causing enemy gunners to fire upon him and reveal their position , bringing about their defeat .  | This 22-year-old veteran said , however , that he and his comrades experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders to start the invasion . He said they showed it in funny ways . For instance , one soldier cleaned and recleaned his rifle . Another looked at his watch every few seconds , and a third could n't seem to satisfy himself that his gun was loaded , checking it a dozen or so times . Our young hero and his comrades may have been scared stiff , but they had learned that secret trademark of a good soldier ? fear control . The magnificent thing I ran onto was the universal eagerness of the wounded to get back in the fight . They seemed to resent the fact that the boys with whom they went overseas were still in the thick of things , while they were forced to " loaf in a hospital . " The Army 's program has sold them on the idea that Army life , despite its hazards , is not so frightening . That " salesmanship " is significant . For the success of neuropsychiatry is measured by the number of soldiers kept in the Army ? not by the number eliminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploits are achieved by veterans who have returned to the fight after their wounds have healed . Other valuable contributions have been chalked up by men whose first maladjustments might have wrecked their Army careers had they not been corrected . Take the case of fellows who develop jitters while on training maneuvers . These same soldiers have been transformed into first-rate cooks , mechanics , and builders who have a vital part to play in winning the war . Those who are being shipped back from North Africa and the South Pacific as mental and nervous cases benefit greatly from the program . The neuropsychiatrists who treat them are experienced in straightening minds . They know that these casualties are not insane ? that with proper treatment they will respond in a locale that has none of the dangers and fury of the fighting fronts . The trouble in most cases is that these men came from obscure little grooves in civil life , and their minds slipped when they came up against the rigors of war . Most of them will be able to return to the life they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zero hour , the psychiatrists recommend that the neurotics be kept busy . So at Walter Reed and the other great Army hospitals you find them deeply engrossed in occupational therapy . Some make belts , ship models , chessmen ; others knit or embroider . A few skilled in the arts are kept occupied with paintbrush and clay . With their hands busy , their minds have less war , the neuropsychiatrists appear slated for work equally as important as that in which they are now engaged . For they alone know the things about the returning soldiers that will make it possible to fit them back into civilian life . As they now are helping soldiers out of unhappy situations into niches that make soldiering endurable , they will be able to guide the veterans to happier ground . Having come from civilian life themselves , the psychiatrists will themselves return to it , and there continue to give advice and aid to the men whom they helped to lick fear and the enemy .  |              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
