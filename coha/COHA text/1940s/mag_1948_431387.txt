 | You seldom pay much attention to a cough ? except when you are embarrassed by uncontrollable coughing in church or at the theatre . You notice a cough if you have a cold or a touch of flu , not because of the ugh but because you feel bad and the cough is ? t of your discomfort . But if you or some member of your family has a chronic cough , you usually disregard it . You become so accustomed to it that you do n't even hear it . You ignore coughs because often you cough without being ill . You get something down your throat , or you 're nervous , or you have been under unusual strain and have been smoking so much you have irritated your throat , so you cough a little , and that 's : hat . You scarcely know you are coughing unless your cough is a symptom of some ailment such as influenza . Then you call the doctor , not because of your cough but because you feel miserable . The chances are that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to go into a tailspin every time you or your husband coughs a little , for it may be just a nuisance . A smoker 's cough , for Instance , does n't do you any good , as we shall see , but it is n't too serious . A cough that accompanies a cold or some minor respiratory complaint is a bore , but it wears off . However , a cough can be an extremely important danger signal . In many instances it is a symptom of a condition that demands prompt and competent attention . It is a good idea to understand why you cough and to know when you should consult your doctor . Coughing is a protective system for your air passages . Those from the nose to the lungs must , of course , be kept clear . When you swallow something the wrong way or inhale a foreign substance , the air in the lungs is used as an explosive force to expel the obstruction . This violent exhalation is called a cough ; it is a reflex action , normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of trouble when it occurs because of involuntary effort to get rid of excess secretions dripping into the air passages , and when it is a symptom of certain diseases . SINUS TROUBLE . This is the most common cause of a chronic cough . Your sinuses are infected and inflamed , your nose gets blocked , a discharge drains into your throat , and you cough . Sometimes you are bothered only when you first go to bed at night and when you awaken in the morning . Sometimes you cough up phlegm from time to time all day long . Sometimes your sinuses keep reasonably clear until you smoke or drink a cocktail ; then they may be affected by the tobacco or alcohol , and you cough . When you go to the doctor , he treats your sinusitis , not your cough . When your sinuses are healthy and clear , you do n't cough . If @#  | you cough and spit , do n't diagnose your condition . Do n't say , " It 's my sinuses . As soon as I have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You may be wrong . TUBERCULOSIS . The second most frequent cause of coughing and spitting is far more serious than sinusitis ; it is tuberculosis of the lungs . Unfortunately , it is possible to have pulmonary tuberculosis for quite a long time without suspecting it . Although a cough may be a symptom of an advanced stage of tuberculosis , it is often the only indication the person notices . With tuberculosis , as with sinusitis , the cough is a symptom , not the real problem . At first the doctor may use drugs to relieve the coughing and spitting , while he gets treatment for the : iisease well under way . Once the disease is under control , the cough clears up . OTHER CAUSES . Other potentially grave diseases have a cough as a symptom in their early stages . For instance , a cough may result from chronic bronchitis caused : lot by trouble basically in the respiratory tract but by high blood pressure or cariac insufficiency . A person over forty who has paroxysms of coughing at night may suffer merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cough . More men - Han women go to doctors with this com : : ai nt , not because women do n't suffer from " cardiac asthma , " but because omen are disturbed when their husands cough wretchedly at night and in , 1st that something should be done about But they neglect themselves . A cough may result from a lung abscess . An abscess often is caused by infectious material that got into the lung and never as dislodged . Or a cough may indicate an abscess in the wall of the air passage . Such an abscess usually is caused by : unchopneumonia in childhood that riled to subside . A lung or chest tumor may have a c ) ugh as a symptom . The tumor may be tenign or malignant ; a wheezy cough and rood in the sputum are an order to see me doctor without delay .

Although you need n't be alarmed if your : eusband develops a chronic cough , you must be intelligent and insist that he consult a doctor at once . Early diagnosis can lee a lifesaver . Allergies may make you cough . This cough , though not so serious as certain ethers , is just as much bother . Sometimes people who work with furs or in chemical : ndustries become allergic to dust or fumes and develop a chronic cough . People become allergic even to household dust . In such cases , of course , the doctor : ekes care of the allergy . Obviously , then , you should be sensible and never neglect a cough that lasts more than a couple of weeks . You should be particularly careful if your child begins to cough . He may have swallowed a button or a safety pin or a tack . He may have a mild bronchitis or the " asthmatic bronchitis " children are subject to . He may have enlarged glands as the result of croup . If these glands , near the root of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | he coughs . He may have ear trouble . Whatever the cause , never give your child cough medicine . If he does n't stop coughing after a short while , tell the doctor . The " nervous " cough is a phenomenon ; apparently nothing is the matter physically . Like people who clear their throats frequently in moments of stress ; some people cough . This may indicate a psychoneurosis ? a mental depression or an anxiety state . If there is any basis for suspecting a neurosis , a psychiatrist might , by discovering the reason for the cough , cure it and make the patient 's life in general much happier . Sometimes a nervous cough is a sign of emotional resignation to an illness , although the cough has nothing to do with the illness . And often a nervous cough is just that . A cigarette cough is different . You say smugly , " I know I smoke too much . " You do n't excuse your cough ; you just explain blandly . You know it is n't catching , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't kill you , but it may keep you under par and lower your resistance to infection . This is what happens : Excessive smoking first produces inflammation of the vocal box and windpipe . You get smoker 's bronchitis , and the whole respiratory tract suffers . But you go right on smoking immoderately . In the winter you catch cold . The irritation caused by too much smoking increases the irritation caused by your cold , so your cold hangs on a long while . As time goes on , your colds last longer and longer and are more and more frequent . Finally they never quite clear up , and you have a cigarette cough . A cigarette cough , though not wholly harmless , is not too dangerous . The real risk is that it might mask something more serious . You are so accustomed to coughing that you fail to recognize a serious condition of which the cough is symptomatic . HERE are two main points to keep in mind about coughing : 1 . A chronic cough is never normal . When a cough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent reason , some abnormal condition has occurred in your body . The condition is not necessarily grave or alarming ; it may be so trivial that it will not interfere with your life or your health . But a cough may indicate the early stage of some truly dangerous disease , such as heart trouble , tuberculosis , or cancer . If this is the case , your cough is a warning ; if you heed . it , it may save you from grim trouble nd may even save your life . 2 . A cough is not a disease ; it is a symptom . A responsible doctor does not treat a cough without searching for its cause . Do n't be alarmed every time you or your husband or your child coughs . But never neglect a cough that persists .
