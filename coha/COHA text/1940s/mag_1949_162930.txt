The sudden gale-driven snowstorm kept getting worse . Andy Archuleta could hardly see through the white swirl as he tried to keep his old Ford coupe on the drifted Wyoming road . When he was less than a mile from his home near Hillsdale ( pop . 125 ) , the car stalled for good . Andy used his head . He got out , dragged a fence post through the snow for fuel . Then he pulled off a hubcap , took it back inside . the car and lighted a little fire in it . <P> He huddled over it with his wife and five-year-old daughter . For hours , as the storm howled , they coughed with smoke and fed their flame . But gradually the numbing cold sapped their strength . As they sat snuggled together with their arms around each other , the fire went out . The wind blew fine snow through every crack in the car , heaped it tightly around them . Thus blanketed , they died . <P> The storm which killed them last week was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. from Canada , bellowed across the Dakotas , parts of Wyoming , Nebraska , Kansas and Colorado almost without warning . It lasted for three days ; temperatures dropped far below freezing ( lowest : 11 below zero at Laramie , Wyo. ) , and the wind ran as high as 75 miles an hour . <P> Isolation . Neither highway nor railroad snowplows could cope with the storm ; hard drifts formed behind them almost as soon as they had passed . Trains were halted , one after another . When the storm ended there were six passenger trains in the yards at Omaha , eight in Ogden , five at Salt Lake City , five at Cheyenne , six stalled between Sidney , Neb. and Cheyenne , Wyo . <P> Motorists and bus passengers were marooned in stores , juke joints , crossroads hamlets all over the storm area . Like the 343 who spent three days jammed in a tavern at tiny ( pop . 4 ) Rockport , Colo , many went without beds and got short rations as supplies ran out . Fifty-eight stranded people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks obligingly unloaded groceries and distributed them to the hungry . <P> In Colorado , soldiers from Camp Carson drove Army Weasels through the storm to bring out patients bound for hospitals . On the open range , the storm threatened thousands of cattle ; they drifted in bunches , rumps to the wind , weakening steadily from lack of food . <P> To the Rescue . When the blizzard finally blew itself out , Army planes took off to drop supplies , scour the snow-burdened plains for signs of distress . Some spotted stranded motorists , who had survived miraculously far from towns . Some had been lucky enough to sit out the storm in their cars . One man and his wife who were marooned near Scottsbluff , Neb. had even found food-frozen ears of corn from roadside fields . <P> The frozen bodies of a rancher , his wife and their two children were found in a field near Rockport , Colo . They had left their car , had tried to cut across the prairie , a mile to their home . The rancher 's body was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheltered the body of their daughter . Both had wrapped part of their clothing around the children before they died . <P> At week 's end the death toll stood at 22.
