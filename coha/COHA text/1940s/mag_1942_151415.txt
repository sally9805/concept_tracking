Columbia University 's College of Physicians &; Surgeons announced a new scholarship fund of $7,000 last week : in honor of its Doorman Charles Costello and the late George Peters , coatroom attendant . George and Charlie both went to work at P. &; S. in 1898 . They knew every student who ever marched through the doors , kept track of their whereabouts after they graduated . At an alumni dinner three years ago , Charlie greeted by name every member of the class of 1915 . Once , said Dr. Louis Casamajor , chairman of the scholarship committee , he heard George mumbling discontentedly at his work . When asked the reason , George replied : " We 've just had an exam in surgery and it was n't fair . "
