A Highland Fling ( by Margaret Curtis ; produced by George Abbott ) is as Scottish as it sounds but hardly as lively . A yarn about the ghost of a rakish 18th-Century laird , it tries for both rowdy fun and romantic charm , never quite spears either . <P> Too much of a highflier on earth to have got his wings in Heaven , Charlie MacKenzie ( Ralph Forbes ) has spectrally hugged his old haunts for 150 years . At the moment he is pleasantly taken up with an appealing village " daftie " ( Playwright Curtis ) - only children and dafties , of course , can communicate with ghosts . From his angel wife Charlie learns that he can still crash the pearly gates if he reforms a living sinner . He pitches on the neighborhood 's lustiest devotee of Scotch , women and dice , and their efforts to outsmart each other provide the brightest moments in the play . In the course of it all Charlie outsmarts himself ; no Heavenly fling , he discovers , can equal a good old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a nice sense for prankish complications , A Highland Fling just is n't written with enough gusto or grace . Its romantic moods never quite blend Scotland with fairyland ; the thistle is there , but not the thistledown . And its fun is too often tame and even cute - a sort of A. A. Milne version of Tam O'Shanter.
