The play was nearly two years old . Including picture rights , it had earned around $750,000 . Nevertheless , ticket scalpers were asking and getting $10 a head for opening-night seats , and the house was sold out for the whole run . <P> This answer to an advance man 's prayer happened last week at the Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope , Pa . Reason for it was the appearance ( for ten performances ) of Authors George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart , aided and sabotaged by tongue-tied Harpo Marx , in their Broadway hit play , The Man Who Came to Dinner . <P> Actor Kaufman , complete with spectacles , a wispy beard and a wicked musache , bore down on the part of Sheridan Whiteside , the famed lecturer who goes to a dull dinner party in an Ohio town , gets hurt , and has to stay on in the house for weeks . Looking unaccountably Machiavellian , not at all like Alexander Woollcott , about whom the part was written , Playwright Kaufman was quite professional . So was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a caricature of Noel Coward , looked like any U.S. traveling salesman . <P> Asked why he had wanted to play The Man , Kaufman , who is a stockholder of the Playhouse and a resident of New Yorkerized Bucks County , said : " Pure exhibitionism . I 'm just making a spectacle of myself . " <P> What most people who went to the <P> Bucks County Playhouse really waited for was to hear mute Harpo speak and play himself ( Banjo ) . In the third act they were rewarded by the bandersnatch entrance of Harpo , minus his red fright-wig but plus a violent shirt with enormous purple and red flowers . Wildly ogling the indulgent audience , he plucked all the Harpo strings , blew bubble gum , enjoyed himself no end . Last time he had spoken out loud on the stage was 25 years ago in a Texas tank town . The long silence had not improved his manners . Said he , stealing a line from the play 's catty hero : " I may vomit . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
