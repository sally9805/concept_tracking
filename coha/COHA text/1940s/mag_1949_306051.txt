Regina ( written &; composed by Marc Blitzstein ; produced by Cheryl Crawford in association with Clinton Wilder ) sets Lillian Hellman 's The Little Foxes to music . As music , it is more clever than distinguished ; as drama , it is clearly a littler Foxes . But on its own terms-and they are wisely very much its own-it is an exhilarating and enjoyable show . <P> It is not the text of The Little Foxes that Regina has altered : the storyline scarcely varies an inch . It is the tone . With its sharp claws and ruthless clawing , its treacherous wiles and wheelchair theatrics , The Little Foxes might have yielded something inordinately operatic . But though his big scenes are sometimes florid enough , Composer Blitzstein 's version of the Alabama Hubbards is fundamentally comic . Regina much less suggests a social critic excoriating an emerging class of plunderers than a first-rate showman exhibiting a prize assortment of hellions . Blitzstein 's Hubbards cavort the whole time they conspire , and the general effect is of exuberance rather than tension . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbolism , seen as foxes chiefly engaged in outfoxing one another , the Hubbards take their place in the long comic tradition of cheating cheaters . And the tone is becoming to Composer ( The Cradle Will Rock ) Blitzstein , who gets strident when shaking his fist but is vivacious when thumbing his nose . As plain razzing-it falls flat when it reaches for satire-Regina teems with brisk musical stage directions , brilliant little jingles , V-for-villainy motifs , high-spirited hocuspocus . <P> Blitzstein is also a clever musical impersonator : at home in a great variety of styles , he turns out spirited polkas , convincing Negro jazz , grandiose arias , lilting quartets . Moreover , in Regina the music constitutes the actual train ride , not just ( as in musicomedy ) the stops along the line . <P> The whole production-including Horace Armistead 's sets and Robert Lewis ' staging-has been done with style . Though an effective Regina in her first serious Broadway role , Jane Pickens , with perhaps the least vocal right , leaves the most determinedly operatic impression . More memorable are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newcomer Russell Nype 's comic charm as the loathsome Leo . <P> <P> The Producer . In her 18 years as one of the two regulars among Broadway 's few women producers , * Regina 's Cheryl Crawford has managed to combine hardheaded business instinct and high-minded theatrical taste . The results were more praiseworthy than profitable until she found a knack for offbeat musicals : 1942 's revival of Porgy and Bess , 1943 's One Touch of Venus , 1947 's Brigadoon-her biggest hit , after some of the town 's canniest producers had turned it down . <P> A tailored , severely handsome woman of 47 who never wastes a word ( or a dollar of production costs ) , Producer Crawford went from her native Akron to Smith College , and then straight to Broadway . She joined the Theatre Guild as a part-time secretary , worked her way up through odd jobs to casting director , quit in 1931 to become a founder and director of the fiery young Group Theatre , which launched Clifford Odets , Sidney Kingsley , William Saroyan , Elia Kazan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
