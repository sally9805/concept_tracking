Sense of Humor A Story by V. S. Pritchett Drawing by Bernard Perlin 1 T STARTED one Saturday . I was working new ground and I decided I 'd stay at the hotel over the weekend and put in an appearance at church . " All alone ? " asked the girl in the cash desk . It had been raining since ten o'clock . " Mr. Good has gone , " she said . " And Mr. Straker . He usually stays with us . But he 's gone . " " That 's where they make their mistake , " I said . " They think they know everything because they 've been on the road all their lives . " " You 're a stranger here , are n't you ? " she said . " I am , " I said . " And so are you . " " How do you know that ? " " Obvious , " I said . " Way you speak . " " Let 's have a light , " she said . " So 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was how it started . The rain was pouring down on the glass roof of the office . She had a cup of tea steaming on the register . I said I 'd have one , too . What 's it going to be and I 'll tell them , she said , but I said just a cup of tea . " I do n't drink , " I said . " Too many soakers on the road as it is . " I was staying there the weekend so as to be sharp on the selling job on Monday morning . What 's more it pays in these small towns to turn up at church on Sundays , Presbyterians in the morning , Methodists in the evening . Say " Good morning " and " Good evening " to them . " Ah ! " they say . " Churchgoer ! Pleased to see that ! Teetotaler , too . " Makes them have a second look at your linesin the morning . " Did you like our service , Mister  --  er  --  er ? " " Humphrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See ? It pays . " Conte into the office , Mr. Humphrey , " she said , bringing me a cup . " Listen to that rain . " I went inside . " Sugar ? " she said . " Three , " I said . We settled to a very pleasant chat . She told me all about herself , and we got on next to families . " My father was on the railway , " she said . ? The engine gave a squeal , ' " I said : " ' The driver took out his pocket-knife and scraped him off the wheel : " " That 's it , " she said . " And what is your father 's business ? You said he had a business . " " Undertaker , " I said . " Undertaker ? " she said . " Why not ? " I said . " Good business . Seasonable like everything else . High class undertaker , " I said . She was looking at me all the time wondering what to say and suddenly she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , covering her face with her hands and went on laughing . " Here , " I said . " What 's up ? " " Undertaker ! " She laughed and laughed . Struck me as being a pretty thin joke . " Do n't mind me , " she said . " I 'm Irish . " " Oh , I see , " I said . " That 's it , is it ? Got a sense of humor . " Then the bell rang and a woman called out " Muriel ! Muriel ! " and there was a motor bike making a row at the front door . " AU right , " the girl called out . " Excuse me a moment , Mr. Humphrey , " she said . " Do n't think me rude . That 's my boy friend . He has no business turning up like this . " She went out but there was her boy friend looking over the window ledge into the office . He had come in . He had a cape on , soaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hair . It was fair hair . It stood up on end . He 'd been economizing on the brilliantine . He did n't wear a hat . He gave me a look and I gave him a look . I did n't like the look of him . And he did n't like the look of me . A smell of oil and petrol and rain and mackintosh came off him . He had a big mouth with thick lips . They were very red . I recognized him at once as the son of the man who ran the Kounty Garage . I saw this chap when I put my car away . The firm 's car . A lockup , because of the samples . Took me ten minutes to ram the idea into his head . He looked as though he 'd never heard of samples . Slow  --  you know the way they are in the provinces . Slow on the job . " Oh , Colin , " says she . " What do you want ? " " Nothing , " the chap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " To see me ? " " Just to see you . " " You came in this morning . " " That 's right , " he said . He went red . " You was busy , " he said . " Well , I 'm busy now , " she said . He bit his tongue , and licked his big lips over and took a look at me . Then he started grinning . " I got the new bike , Muriel , " he said . " I 've got it outside . " " It 's just come down from the works , " he said . " The laddie wants you to look at his bike , " I said . So she went out and had a look at it . When she came back she had got fid of him . " Listen to that rain , " she said . " Lord , I 'm fed up with this line , " she said . " What line ? " I said . " The hotel line ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right up to the back teeth with it . " " And you 've got good teeth , " I said . " There 's not the class of person there used to be in it , " she said . " All our family have got good teeth . " " Not the class ? " " I 've been in it five years and there 's not the same class at all . You never meet any fel-lows . " " Well , " said I. " If they 're like that half-wit at the garage , they 're nothing to be stuck on . And you 've met me . " I said it to her like that . " Oh , " says she . " It is n't as bad as that yet . " It was cold in the office . She used to sit all day in her overcoat . She was a smart girl with a big friendly chin and a second one coming and her forehead and nose were covered with freckles . She had copper-colored hair too . She got her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , too , off the Hollenborough mantle man . I told her 1 could do her better stockings than the ones she 'd got on . She got a good reduction on everything . Twenty-five or thirty-three and a third . She had her expenses cut right back . I took her to the pictures that night in the car . I made Colin get the car out for me . " That boy wanted me to go on the back of his bike . On a night like this , " she said . " Oh , " she said , when we got to the pictures . " Two shillings is too much . Let 's go into the one-and-sixes at the side and we can nip across into the two-shillings when the lights go down . " " Fancy your father being an undertaker , " she said in the middle of the show . And she started laughing as she had laughed before . She had her head screwed on all right . She said , " Some girls have no pride once the lights go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took a box of something . Samples , mostly , they did n't cost me anything . " Do n't thank me , " I said . " Thank the firm . " Every time I took her out I pulled the blinds in the back seat of the car to hide the samples . That chap Colin used to give us oil and petrol . He used to give me a funny look . Fishy sort of small eyes he 'd got . Always looking miserable . Then we would go off . Sunday was her free day . Not that driving 's any holiday for me . And , of course , the firm paid . She used to take me down to see her family for the day . Start in the morning , and taking it you had dinner and tea there , a day 's outing cost us nothing . Her mother was dead : her father was something on the railway , retired . F F VERY time I was up there Colin used to come in looking for her . " Oh Colin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car yet ? " He knew where he got off with me . " No , now , I ca n't Colin . I tell you I 'm ing out with Mr. Humphrey , " she used to to him . I heard her . " He keeps on badgering me , " she said to me . " You leave him to me , " I said . " No , he 's all right , " she said . " You let me know if there 's any with Colin , " I said . " Seems to be a scarum sort of half-wit to me , " I said . " And he spends every penny he makes , " she said . Well , we know that sort of thing is all right while it lasts , I told her , but the trouble is that it does n't last . We were always meeting Colin on the road . I took no notice of it first of all and then Igrew suspicious and awkward at always meeting him . He had a new motor bicycle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to fly over the moor with , flat out . Muriel and I used to go out over the moor to Ingley Wood in the firm 's Morris  --  I had a customer out that way . " May as well do a bit of business while you 're about it . " I said . " About what ? " she said . " Ah ha ! " I said . " That 's what Colin wants to know , " I said . Sure enough , coming back we 'd hear him popping and backfiring close behind us , and I put out my hand to stop him and keep him following us , biting our dirt . " I see his little game , " I said . " Following us . " So I saw to it that he did follow . We could hear him banging away behind us and the traffic is thick on the Ingley road in the afternoon . " Oh let him pass , " Muriel said . " I ca n't stand those dirty things banging in my ears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his scarf flying out , blazing red into the traffic . " We 're doing 58 ourselves , " she said , leaning across to look . " Powerful buses those , " I said . " Any fool can do it if he 's got the power . Watch me step on it . " But we did not catch Colin . Half an hour later he passed us coming back . Cut right in between us and a lorry  --  I had to brake hard . I damn nearly killed him . His ears were red with the wind . He did n't wear a hat . I got after him as soon as I could but I could n't touch him . Nearly every weekend I was in that town seeing my girl , that fellow was hanging around . He came into the bar on Saturday nights , he poked his head into the office on Sunday mornings . It was a sure bet that if we went out in the car he would pass us on the road . Every time we would hear that scarlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter where we were . He passed us on the main road , he met us down the side roads . There was a little cliff under oak trees at May Ponds , she said , where the view was pretty . And there , soon after we got there , was Cohn on the other side of the water , watching us . Once we found him sitting on his bike , just as though he were waiting for us . " You been here in a car ? " I said . " No , motor bike , " she said and blushed . " Cars ca n't follow in these tracks . " She knew a lot of places in that country . Some of the roads were n't roads at all and were bad for tires and I did n't want the firm 's car scratched by bushes , but you would have thought Colin could read what was in her mind . For nine times out of ten he was there . It got on my nerves . It was a red , roaring , powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to speak to Colin , " I said . " I wo n't have him annoying you . " " He 's not annoying me , " she said . " I 've got a sense of humor . " " Here Colin , " I said one evening when I put the car away . " What 's the idea ? " He was taking off his overalls . He pretended he did not know what / was talking about . He had a way of rolling his eyeballs , as if they had got wet and loose in his head , while he was speaking to me and you neverknew if it was sweat or oil on his face . It was always pale , with high color on his cheeks and very red lips . " Miss MacFarlane does n't like being followed , " I said . He dropped his jaw and gaped at me . I could not tell whether he was being very surprised or very sly . I used to call him " Marbles " because when he spoke he seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said he never went to the places we went to , except by accident . He was n't following us , he said , but we were following him . We never let him alone , he said . Everywhere he went , he said , we were there . Take last Saturday , he said , we were following him for miles down the bypass , he said . But you passed us first and then sat down in front , I said . I went to Ingley Wood , he said . And you followed me there . No , we did n't , I said , Miss MarFarlane decided to go there . He said he did not want to complain but fair was fair . I suppose you know , he said , that you have taken my girl off me . Well , you can leave me alone , ca n't you ? " Here , " I said , " One minute ! Not so fast ! You said I 've taken Miss MacFarlane from you . Well , she was never your girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " She was my girl , " was all he said . He was pouring oil into my engine . Ile had some cotton wool in one hand and the can in the other . He wiped up the green oil that had overflowed , screwed on the cap . pulled down the bonnet and whistled to himself . I went back to Muriel and told her what Colin had said . " I do n't like trouble , " I said . " Do n't you worry , " she said . " I had to have someone to go to all these places with before you came . Could n't stick in here all day Sun-day . " " Ah , " I said . " That 's it , is it ? You 've been to all these places with him ? " " Yes , " she said . " And he keeps on going to them . He 's sloppy about me . " " Good God , " I said . " Sentimental mem-ories . " I felt sorry for that fellow . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose he could n't help himself . Well , it takes all sorts to make a world , as my old mother used to say . If we were all alike it would n't do . Some men ca n't save money . It just runs through their fingers . He could n't save money so he lost her . I suppose all he thought of was love . I could have been friends with that fellow . As it was I put a lot of business his way . I did n't want him to get the wrong idea about me . We 're all human after all . T E DID N'T have any more trouble with / Colin after this until Bank Holiday . I was going to take her down to see my family . The old man 's getting a bit past it now and has given up living over the shop . He 's living out on the Barnum Road , beyond the tram stop . We were going down in the firm 's car , as per usual , but something watt wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the holiday . I was wild about this . What 's the use of a garage who ca n't do a rush job for the holidays ! What 's the use of being an old customer if they 're going to let you down ! I went for Colin bald-headed . " You knew I wanted it , " I said . " It 's no use trying to put me off with a tale about the stuff not coming down from the works . I 've heard that one before . " I told him he 'd got to let me have another car , because he 'd ! et me down . I told him I would n't pay his account . I said I 'd take my business away from him . But there was n't a car to be had in the town because of the holiday . I could have knocked the fellow down . After the way I 'd sent business to him . Then I saw through his little game . He knew Muriel and I were going to my people and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw this I let him know that it would take what I over a couple of quid . I could have murdered Colin . We got there at last . We walked up from the tram stop . Mother was at the window and let us in . " This is Miss MacFarlane , " I said . And mother said : " Oh , pleased to meet you . We 've heard a lot about you . " " Oh , " mother said to me , giving me a kiss , " Are you tired ? You have n't had your tea , have you ? Sit down . Have this chair , dear . It 's more comfortable . " " Well , my boy , " my father said . " Want a wash , " my father said . " We 've got a wash basin downstairs , " he said . " I used not to mind about washing upstairs before . Now I could n't do without it . Funny how your ideas change as you get older . " " How 's business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " How 's yours ? " " You knew , " he said , " we took off the horses : except for one or two of the older families we have got motors now . " But he 'd told me that the last time I was there . I 'd been at him for years about motor hearses . " You 've forgotten I used to drive them , " I said . " Bless me , so you did , " he said . He took me up to my room . He showed me everything he had done to the house , " Your mother likes it , " he said . " The traffic 's company for her . You know what your mother is for company . " Then he gives me a funny look . " Who 's the girl ? " he says . My mother came in then and said : " She 's pretty , Arthur . " " Of course she 's pretty , " I said . " She 's ' Irish . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Got a sense of humor , eh ? " " She would n't be marrying me if she had n't , " I said . And then I gave them a look . " Marrying her , did you say ? " exclaimed my father . " Any objection ? " I said . " Now Ernest dear , " said my mother . " Leave the boy alone . Come down while I pop the kettle on . " She was terribly excited . " Miss MacFarlane , " the old man said . " No sugar , thank you , Mrs. Humphrey . I beg your pardon , Mr. Humphrey ? " " The Glen Hotel at Swansea , I do n't suppose you know that ? " my father said . " 1 wondered if you did being in the catering line . " " It does n't follow she knows every hotel , " my mother said . " Forty years ago , " the old man said , " I was staying at the Glen in Swansea and the head waiter ... . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss MacFarlane does n't want to hear that one , " my mother said . " How 's business with you , Mr. Humphrey ? " said Muriel . " We passed a large cemetery near the station . " " The whole business has changed so that you would n't know it , in my lifetime , " said my father . " Silver fittings have gone clean out . Everyone wants simplicity nowadays . Restraint . Dignity , " my father said . " Prices did it , " my father said . " The war , " he said . " You could n't get the wood , " he said . " Take ordinary mahogany , just an ordinary piece of mahogany . Or teak , " he said . " Take teak . Or walnut . " " You can certainly see the world go by in this room , " 1 said to my mother . " It never stops , " she said . Now he began talking about how the town had changed , and how it was all bicycles over the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cars . They came up over the hill where the A.A. man stands and choked up round the tram stop . It was mostly holiday traffic . Everything with a wheel on it was out . " On that stretch , " my father told me , " they get three accidents a week . " There was an ambulance station at the crossroads . We had hardly finished talking about this , in fact the old man was still saying that something ought to be done , when the telephone rang . " Name of MacFarlane ? " the voice said on the wire . " No . Humphrey , " my father said . " There is a Miss MacFarlane here . " " There 's a man named Colin Mitchell lying seriously injured in an accident at the Cottage Hospital , gave me the name of MacFarlane as his nearest relative . " That was the Police . On to it at once . That fellow Colin had followed us down by road . MAGAZINE Cry , I never heard a girl cry , as Muriel cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died in the ambulance . Cutting in , the old game he used to play on me . Clean off the saddle and under the Birmingham bus . The blood was everywhere , they said . People were still looking at it when we went by . Head on . What a mess ! Do n't let 's talk about it . She wanted to see him but they said " No . " There was n't anything recognizable to see . She put her arms round my neck and cried " Colin , Colin , " as if I were Cohn , and clung to me . I was feeling sick myself . I held her tight and I kissed her and I thought " Holiday ruined . " " Damn fool man , " I thought . " Poor devil , " I thought . " I knew he 'd do something like this , " she said . " There , there , " I said to her . " Do n't think about Colin . " Did n't she love me , I said , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , she had . And she loved me . But , " Oh , Colin ! Oh , Colin ! " she cried , " And Colin 's mother , " she cried . " Oh it 's terrible . " She cried and cried . We put her to bed and I sat with her and my mother kept coming in . " Leave her to me , " I said . " I understand her . " Before they went to bed they both came in and looked at her . She lay sobbing with her head in the pillow . I could quite understand her being upset . Colin was a decent fellow . He was always doing things for her . He mended her electric lamp and he riveted the stem of a wine glass so that you could n't see the break . He used to make things for her . He was very good with his hands . She lay on her side with her face burning and feverish with misery and crying , scalded by the salt , and her lips shriveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stroked her forehead . She groaned . Sometimes she shivered and sometimes she clung to me crying , " Oh , Colin ! Colin ! " M Y ARM ached with the cramp and I had a crick in my back , sitting in the awkward way I was on the bed . It was late . There was nothing to do but to ache and sit watching her and thinking . It is funny the way your mind drifts , When I was kissing her and watching her I was thinking out who I 'd show our new autumn line to first . Her hand held my wrist tight and when I kissed her I got her tears on my lips . They burned and stung . Her neck and shoulders were soft and 1 could feel her breath hot out of her nostrils on the back of my hand . Ever noticed how hot a woman 's breath gets when she 's crying ? I drew out my hand and lay down beside her and - Oh , Cohn , Colin , " she sobbed , turning over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to the traffic , staring at the ceiling and shivering whenever the picture of Colin shooting right off that damned red thing into the bus came into my mind until I did not hear the traffic any more , or see the ceiling any more , or think any more , but a change happened  --  I do n't know when . This Colin thing seemed to have knocked the bottom out of everything and I had a funny feeling we were going down and down and down in a lift . " Colin , Colin . Colin , " she said , and her fingers were hooked into me . I got out and turned the key in the door . In the morning I left her sleeping . It did not matter to me what my father might have heard in the night , but still I wondered . She would hardly let me touch her before that . I told her I was sorry but she shut me up . I was afraid of her . I was afraid of mentioning Cohn . I wanted to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . Did she love Colin all the time ? Did she think I i was Colin ? And every time I thought of that poor devil covered over with a white sheet in the hospital mortuary , a kind of picture of , her and me under the sheets with love came linto my mind . I could n't separate the two things . Just as though it had all come from Colin . I 'd rather not talk any more about that . I never talked to Muriel about it . 1 waited for her to say something but she did n't . She did n't say a word . The next day was a bad day . It was gray and hot and the air smelled of oil fumes from the road . There 's always a mess to clear up when things like this happen . I had to see to it . I had the job of ringing up the boy 's mother . But I got round that , thank God , by ringing up the garage and getting them to go ound and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are like this . I was the whole morning- on the phone : to the hospital , the police , the coroner  --  and he stood fussing beside me , jerking up and down like a fat ind iarubber ball . I found my mother washing up at the sink and she said : " That poor boy 's inot ! Ier ! I ca n't stop thinking of her . " Then my father comes in and says , just as though I was a customer : " Of course , if Mrs. Mitchell desires it we can have the remains of the deceased conveyed to his house by one of our new specially sprung motor hearses and can , if necessary , make all the funeral arrangements . " I could have hit him because Muriel came into the room when he was saying this . But she stood there as if nothing had happened . " It 's the least we can do for poor Mrs. Mitchell , " she said . There were small creases of shadow under her eyes which shone with a soft strong light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she were really still in that room with me , asleep . God , I loved that girl ! God , I wanted to get all this over , this damned Colin business that had come right into the middle of everything like this , and I wanted to get married right away . 1 wanted to be alone with her . That 's what Colin did for me . " Yes , " I said . " We must do the right thing by Colin . " " We are sometimes asked for long-distance estimates , " my father said . - It will be a little something , " my mother said . ' Dad and I will talk it over , " I said . " Come into the office , " my father said . " It occurred to me that it would be nice to do the right thing by this friend of yours . " We talked it over . We went into the cost of it . There was the return journey to reckon . We worked it out that it would come no dearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and buried the boy here . That is to say , my father said , if I drove it . " It would look nice , " my father said . " Saves money and it would look a bit friendly , " my father said . " You 've done it before . " " Well , " I said . " I suppose I can get a refund on my return ticket from the railway . " But it was not as simple as it looked , because Muriel wanted to come . She wanted to drive back with me and the hearse . My mother was very worried about this . It might upset Muriel , she thought . Father thought it might not look nice to see a young girl sitting by the coffin of a grown man . " It must be dignified , " my father said . " You see if she was there it might look as though she were just doing it for the ride  --  like these young women on bakers ' vans .

" Besides , " she said , suddenly , in her full open voice  --  it had seemed to be closed and carved and broken and small ? " I 've never been in a hearse before . " " And it will save her fare too , " I said to my father . That night I went again to her room . She was awake . I said 1 was sorry to disturb her but I would go at once only l wanted to see if she was all right . She said , in the closed voice again , that she was all right . " Are you sure ? " I said .

She was lying stiff in the bed . She would not answer . I dropped my hand to her small white shoulder . She stirred and drew up her legs and half turned and said , " I was thinking of Colin .

" " No , no , " she said , " I want to go with Colin . Poor Colin . He loved me and I did n't love him . " And she drew my hands down . " Colin loved me , " she whispered . " Not like this , " I whispered . I wAs a warm gray morning like all the others when we took Colin back . They had fixed the coffin in before Muriel came out . She came down wearing the bright blue hat she had got off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father good-by . They were very sorry for her . " Look after her , Arthur , " my mother said . Muriel MAGAZINE got in beside me without a glance behind her at the coffin . I started the engine . They smiled at us . My father raised his hat , but whether it was to Muriel and me or to Colin , or to the three of us , I do not know . He was not , you see , wearing his top hat . I 'll say this for the old boy , thirty years in the trade have taught him tact . After leaving my Father 's house you have to go down to the tram terminus before you get on to the bypass . There was always one or two drivers , conductors or inspectors there , doing up their tickets , or changing over the trolley arms . When we passed I saw two of them drop their jaws , stick their pencils in their ears , and raise their hats . I was so surprised by this that I nearly raised mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had not driven one of my father 's hearses for years . Hearses are funny things to drive . They are well-sprung , smooth-running cars , with quiet engines and , if you are used to ' driving a smaller car , before you know where you are , you are speeding . You know you ought to go slow , say twenty-five to thirty maximum and it 's hard to keep it down . You can return empty at seventy if you like . It 's like driving a fire engine . Go fast out and come back slow  --  only the other way round . Open out in the country but slow down past houses . That 's what it means . My father was very particular about this . Muriel and I did n't speak very much at first . We sat listening to the engine and the occasional jerk of the coffin behind when we went over a pot hole . We passed the place where poor Colin  --  but I did n't say anything to Muriel , and she , if she noticed  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We went through Cox Hill , Wammering , and Yodley Mount , flat country , do n't care for it myself . " There 's a wonderful lot of building going on , " Muriel said at last . " You wo n't know these places in five years , " I said . But my mind kept drifting away from the road and the green fields and the dullness , and back to Colin . Five days before he had come down this way . I expected to see that Indian coming flying straight out of every corner . But it was all bent and bust up properly now . I saw the damned thing . He had been up to his old game , following us , and that had put the end to following . But not quite ; he was following us now , behind us in the coffin . Then my mind drifted off that and I thought of those nights at my parents ' house , and Muriel . You never know what a woman is going to be like . I thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , supposing she had a baby . You see I had reckoned on waiting eighteen months or so . I would have eight hundred pounds then . But if we had to get married at once . we should have to cut right down . Then I kept thinking it was funny her saying " Colin ! " lie that in the night ; it was funny it made her feel that way with me. and how it made me feel when she called me Colin . I 'd never thought of her in that way , in what you might call the " Cohn " way . I looked at her and she looked at me and she smiled but still we did not say very much , but the smiles kept coming to both of us . The light-railway bridge at Dootheby took me by surprise and I thought the coffin gave a jump as we took it . " Colin 's still watching us , " I nearly said . There were tears in her eyes . " What was the matter with Colin ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did n't you marry him ? " " Yes , " she said . " He was a nice boy . But he had no sense of humor . " " And I wanted to get out of that town , " she said . " I 'm not going to stay there , at that hotel , " she said . want to get away , " she said . " I 've had enough . " She had a way of getting angry with the air , like that . " You 've got to take me away , " she said . We were passing slowly into Muster , there was a tram ahead and people thick on the narrow pavements , dodging out into the road . But when we got into the Market Square where they were standing around , they saw the coffin . They began to raise their hats . Suddenly she laughed . " It 's like being the King and Queen , " she said . " They 're raising their hats , " she said . " Not all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I had to keep her from jumping about like a child on the scat as we went through . " There they go . " " Boys always do , " I said . " And another . " " Let 's see what the policeman does . " She started to laugh but I shut her up . " Keep your sense of humor to yourself , " I said . Through all those towns that run into one another as you might say , we caught it . We went through , as she said , like royalty . So many years since I drove a hearse , I 'd forgotten what it was like . I was proud of her , I was proud of Colin , and I was proud of myself . And , after what had happened . I mean on the last two nights , it was like a wedding . And although we knew it was for Cohn , it was for us too , because Colin was with both of us . It was like this all the way . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise his hat ? People ought to show respect for the dead , " she said .
