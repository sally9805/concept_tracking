A Communication The Power of Nationalism ont : A day before I got The New Republic of Septem ber 6 , 1943 , I had spent a lot of time talking with a leader of the French underground . A day or two before , I had been talking with people out of Norway . Since I got that number of The New Republic and read Albert Gueratd 's article , I have seen more people out of France and , in all probability , before this article appears , I shall have seen more representatives of the nations under the Nazi yoke . And all of them , I am sure , would read Mr. Guerard 's article , " For a Federated Europe , " with varying emotions : surprise , anger , fear , disillusionment . If that is what a man of the highest distinction , French by birth and American by adoption , a historian , an artist , thinks are the realities of the European situation , God help us when we have to deal with average Americans , with career diplomats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States Chamber of Commerce , with advertising men , with any or all of the run-of-the-mill Americans who will have so much to say about our future in the next few months . For if Albert Guerard can so misjudge the temper of Europe , the very conditions of remedial action , the very bases of any organization for peace , for liberty , for liberalism , what can we hope for ? The thesis set forth in , this article is that the Nazis have made such a clean sweep in , Europe that the old national obstacles to unity are gone . " The , Europe wrecked by nationalism lies in ruin ; ancl it would be the acme. of foolishness to rebuild the crazy edifice on the same lines , with minor improvements whith might preve worse than previous evils . I do not believe in bombardment as a method of slum clearance ; but once the slums are ? cleared , who in his senses would rebuild them as slums ? " The slums are the historical national units of Europe ; the bombardment is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well planned , rational Green Belt settlement . On this metaphor he builds his church ; the church of the good European soaring above the narrow particularism of the past . The aim is admirable ; I should him to be a good European , I try to be . I should like to live in a humane , liberal , free , unified Europe , a Europe in which Thomas Mann might be the . typical German , Albert Guerard the typical Frenchman . It is quite true , too , that people like Guerard and people like me have more in common than we have with most of our fellow countrymen . There are few houses . where I feel more at home than I have done in his house in Palo Alto . There are a good many houses in France and America where I am more at home than I am in any but a few houses in Britain . But this common membership in the Republic of Letters or the Commonwealth of Men of Goad Will is n't what makes men fight , resist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have found is to be a . Proustian . If you meet a fellow addict , you already know a lot about him as well as having an easy conversational opening , but you do n't know enough to trust him with your life or to risk your life to save his . And that is what people are doing every day in Europe , because their national feeling tells them that it is their duty to do so . The executioners of Heydrich who took refuge in Lidice did n't talk of Europe and civilization ; they were Czech patriots like their hosts and their hosts died for their country first of all . And a lot of the murdered people of Lidice , I am convinced , died for their country and for nothing else . Four lines deleted by censor . ? En . ) People risk their lives to save the enemies of France 's enemy . They not only risk their lives , they often lose their lives ? not always in pleasant ways ; some of them , the members of underground organizations , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Others are simple peasants and minor officials or shopkeepers ? or even prosperous business men , men who if Americans might be rooting for Harrison Spangler , even for The Chicago Tribune . But , as I say , they risk and lose their lives , often in the company of men who would give Mr. Martin Dies the seven-year jitters . Why ? For a reason stated in 1793 : And it is France , not a cosmopolitan republic , that is worth dying for . Few of them are dying , conspirine , starving for any general European solution , for any coherent program of European reconstruction. , for any coherent program of Czech or French reconstruction . " What , " asked Lord Hugh Cecil in the British House of Commons a generation ago , " what is nationality ? " " Nationality , " replied Tim Healy , " is something that men will die for . Even the noble lord would not die for the meridian of Greenwich . " Causes that men , today , will not die for have no chance of life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meridianof-Greenwich dream for which no man will work in the only possible effective terms of political life in Europe today , being ready , if he has to , to die for it . That this is true is demonstrable in a dozen ways ; all the history of contemporary Europe shows it to he so . Are we fighting for democracy , social services , anti-Semitism , liberty of speech , of learning , of research ? If we are , why are the Swedes , whose country is a home of all these things at least as much as is Norway , not fighting for them while the- Norwegians are Because Norway has been invaded and Sweden has not , which means that the average Swede has not , for all his devotion to our ideals , had the , only call made on him that the average man still responds to , the call of la patrie en danger . If the cause of liberty in itself , or the cause of traditional Western democracy , or the cause of Scandinavian solidarity , were a fighting cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be tens of thousands of Swedish volunteers fighting for Norway ? and there would be tens of thousands of Swedish linedeleted moment that a fighting unity which it has been impossible to create for the kindred and similar Scandinavian peoples is spontaneously being created for European nations with old , bitter and uncured national feuds ? . Behind the ignoring of these facts lies ( among other illusions ) the illusion that Hitler 's victories were largely won by internal sabotage , by the guilty compliance of guilty men in the invaded countries . This illusion was given birth in the astonishment that followed the successful invasion of Norway . As the Left had constantly underestimated the military power of Nazi Germany and , indeed , underestimated the power of military power , some explanation of that brilliant stroke was called for . So the legend of Quisling was created , the legend of a Norway that could have defended herself but was betrayed by a large section of her rulers and her bourgeoisie . The conquest of Norway was easy . Quisling and his fellow traitors had little to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made a day 's difference to the German time-table .. Nor is the story as told of Holland any more like the facts , and I do not believe that any serious section of French opinion , not even the then defeatist French Communists , positively worked for a German triumph . Indeed , the Germans may well wonder why they have had so litde- success considering what seemed , for so long , their overwhelming power . Quisling is a poor fish and so is his Dutch partner , Mussert , and his Belgian opposite number , Degrelle .. The Germans did better in France , but there they bought crooks ; they did not use fanatics . All over Europe , the New Order has failed because hardly anybody would work honestly or seriously for it and tens of thousands were ready to give their lives against it ? because it was their patriotic duty . The case is not much better when we turn to the other side .. Quisling was less of a flop than Kuusinen , and , although the Comintern was able to weaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build up an effective resistance movement when it needed one after June 21 , 1941 , except by playing on the patriotic sentiments of the French people , except by hastily joining de Gaulle . No international cause on either side of the barricade has one percent of the drawing power of patriotism and nationalism . The few German successes in Europe have been achieved in countries in which it was possible to exploit a full-blown or embryonic nationalist movement , in Finland and Rumania , in Hungary , in Slovakia , in Croatia . Elsewhere the parties and governments won over to the New Order have all the integrity , importance and independence of the Republican machine in the state of Mississippi . Patriotism , national pride and passion , that has been the great immaterial obstacle to the German reorganization of Europe ( it has been , in the case of England and Russia , a great material obstacle , too ) . That Stalin knows this is shown by his propaganda inside Russia and outside it . If he were building-battleships now he would not call them Marat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevskys in ships as well as decorations . . . . Is it seriously likely that people who have endured starvation , torture , death , humiliation are suddenly , under an Anglo-American lead , going to relegate this passion , obsession , whatever you choose to call it , to a minor attic of their lives ? The cheerful description of cultural autonomy given by Mr. Guerard , of the Pole indifferent to the fate of Upper Silesia as long as he can wander around speaking his language and practising his religion , struck me as just as fanciful as the- belief , pilloried by Mr. Mencken , that if you give adolescents instruction in the physiology of sex you have really done much for them . What the adolescent suffers from is not ignorance , but love or lust , and he will not be put off with good , clean fun and the most clearly written version of " What a Young Man Should Know . " The love of country , which is the driving force in Europe today , may be a pathological phenomenon , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can no more talk a nation out of it than you can talk a man or woman really infatuated out of infatuation . The Germans have tried . The Czechs have cultural autonomy and a Czech government and , in many ways , a privileged position . Unlike the German , the Hungarian , the Slovak mothers , the mothers of Bohemia can , if they like , sing " I did n't raise my boy to be a soldier . " They are allowed to admire Smetana and Dvorak . But they want to admire Masaryk and the men of Lidice . The- dangers of any doctrinaire refusal to accept these indisputable facts are great . For a few months at most after the liberation , the Anglo-Americans , with food , clothing , medicine in their hands , may be able to buy sullen acceptance of the plans of the Western powers . But the peoples of Europe , like the people of a town where a long strike has been broken by hunger , will forgive good advice less readily than blows . And one of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the super-national planners to get the hell out of here . And when they are asked by Americans to soar above their narrow prejudices , they will remember what Goebbels has told them of riots in Detroit , in Los Angeles ? and they may have more to remember before they are liberated . Only by the greatest tact , only by accepting- the facts of nationality , only by- not confusing San Marino or LichtensteM with the nations , large and small , that men die for , will it be possible to do anything for Europe . A good deal can be done , though not at once or too universally and systematically , to salvage some of the economic gains of larger units . But to start from unity is to doom the most reasonable economic schemes to failure . Not by bread alone do men live ? and that has been proved in Europe , not only by the tenacity of nations that have preferred honor to bread , but by their sons in exile blockading and bombing their starving but unsubmissive peoples . Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it often was before 1939 , it would still have to be dealt with . But nationalism has great potentialities as a revolutionary , dynamic force inside these countries . For in every country occupied by the Germans , the assets of patriotism have passed from the Right to the Left . In France the Communist intellectual , Louis Aragon , has become a sort of super-Beranger . " Le Creve-Coeur " is the passionate expression of the discovery of France as a nation , by Aragon ? and by hundreds of thousands of alienated sons . So it has been in all countries ; although in some , the conservative forces have not discredited themselves as , on the whole , they have in France . But everywhere the temper of the people is what it is in France , Jacobin . The State Department and the War Department have not been wrong in trying to tie up with the nationalist , patriotic , military forces in occupied . Europe . They have been wrong and unsuccessful , because they have failed to recognize them , in the masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin deep and whose simple faith of peasants and workers in their own country has been revealed to be as deep as it was in the France of 1793 . No movements in Europe that do not realize this have any future . Only if the Left can maintain this German-made alliance can it ride the European storm ( Moscow shows by all its words and acts that it knows this ) . For to be repetitious and banal , it has been learned that only fighting creeds are worth bothering about today in Europe , whatever may be true of America . And it is as true today as it was in the days of Lars Porsena or Macaulay that the common man asks : There will be no century of the common man in Europe if the planners of it ignore this truth . They will not even be building their house on sand ; the cellar walls - will cave in as fast as they are dug . London , Eng . D. W. BROGAN IR : Nothing could be more stimulating than a contra-0 versy with D. W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the present time . I am preparing a whole book in defense of the European Nation , in condemnation of provincial feuds and civil wars . Permit me , however , to jot down a few notes . 1 . Germans , Czechs , Poles , Hungarians , Rumanians , etc. , after this war will have to live on either side of arbitrary lines ; in - many cases , they will have to dwell in el ? same territory , even in the same village street . They hate and distrust one another ? . So be it : the more they do so , the more necessary will it be to establish a common law and a nonpartisan police in order to keep the peace . 2. 1 do not deny the enormous power of armed nationalism , the logical consequence of which is Flitlerism ; I am not denying the might of the German armies either . But Hitlerism , either on the ideological plane or on the field of battle , will have to be defeated and transcended . " My country , right or wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ... " France . d'abordl " . ? " Britannia rule the waved " ? many phrases and . a single thought ; and it is that one thought that leads to war . 3 . What I have been attacking for twenty-five years is not nationalism as a sentiment and a tradition , but the territorial fallacy , the unrealistic and tyrannical conception that , on a given area , all men must speak , think and feel alike . That is totalitarianism at its worst . Territorial administration , a practical affair , must be completely divorced from the nationalistic religion , which , like all religions , should be voluntary , untrammeled and unarmed .
