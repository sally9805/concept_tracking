To Stalin 's listeners ( see above ) it was good to know that Kiev was free again . <P> For to the Russians Kiev was the " mother of cities , " Russia 's ancient capital , a venerated center of history and lore , a beloved and lovely spot . From Kiev , Slav buccaneers sailed on their raids to ancient Byzantium , down the Dnieper and across the turbulent Black Sea . A thousand years ago , Kiev 's ruler , Prince Vladimir , was baptized in the sluggish Dnieper , made Kiev the heart of Russia 's Greek Orthodox faith . When Berlin was still a muddy village , Kiev 's famed Petchersky Monastery was green with age . <P> Arrogant Field Marshal Walter von Reichenau , who captured Kiev in 1941 , was not its first alien invader . For eleven centuries , men of the sword-Variags and Khazars , Tatars , Lithuanians and Poles - ravished the beautiful city . The proud conquerors became dust ; Kiev , with its seven rolling hills , its glistening church domes , its banks towering above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the rich , black-soiled south and the forested north , and their wealth was the plasma which always revived it . <P> This week Kiev lay black and tortured again , awaiting transfusion . In its wrecked buildings , Red Army sappers patiently searched for hidden mines . In its streets , the civilian survivors toiled overtime , in a race with the approaching winter . <P> To recapture Kiev , the Russian Supreme Command had picked two of its ablest field commanders : Generals Konstantin Rokossovsky and Nikolai Vatutin . Their armies arrived before Kiev in September , weary after the summer 's cruel fighting . For many weeks , they stood in an arc before the city , regained strength , indifferently pounded the enemy defenses . <P> Reassured , the Wehrmacht pulled some troops out of Kiev , rushed them south to help hold Krivoi Rog . Only then did peasant-faced , tank-wise Vatutin ( by now , for unannounced reasons , in full command ) give the order to attack . His veteran troopers stood on the heights before Kiev and wept with anger and sorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , with fury in their hearts , they swept down upon the foe . <P> Tank spearheads drove through the city , and continued in pursuit . Behind them came the bulk of Vatutin 's army , estimated at 300,000 . German garrisons of some 150,000 men withdrew before the trap was sprung . In Moscow , the Red Army 's newspaper Red Star said proudly : " History has not known such a swift operation . "
