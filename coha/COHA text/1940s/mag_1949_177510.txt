In an effort to brighten up austerity-ridden Britain , the Southern Region of the state-owned railway system devised a pub-on-wheels ( bar car ) which was supposed to be very quaint . The outside of the car features leaded windows , cream panels , false brickwork and fake timbers , and the motif of brummagem antiquity is carried on inside . One of the pubs-on-wheels was in service last week on the Atlantic Coast Express and seven more were being readied . They will have names like " The Bull , " " The Dolphin , " " The Green Man , " " The White Horse . " <P> British connoisseurs were appalled by the fakery ( see cut ) .
