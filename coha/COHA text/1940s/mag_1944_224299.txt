The annual meeting of the American Medical Association in Chicago was steeped in penicillin , politics and progress . About 7,500 doctors jammed the halls of four hotels to saw up a two-year backlog of medical science and gossip . <P> Politics and Personalities . Killed in committee was the California Medical Association 's proposal that A.M.A. Journal Editor Morris Fishbein be ousted . Dr. Fishbein gave out the news himself at one of his daily press conferences . <P> Dr. Herman Louis Kretschmer , incoming president of the Association , repeated organized medicine 's objections to the Wagner-Murray-Dingell Bill ( semisocialized medicine ) , which for twelve months has been in Congressional committee . Said he : " I believe it is incumbent on every physician in this country to devote at least two hours a day to educating the people in his community as to the significance of such legislation " - i.e. , against it . <P> Pressure for some improvement in the distribution of medical care-not necessarily the Wagner-Murray-Dingell Bill-came from the military doctors present : 1 ) Colonel Leonard George Rowntree pointed out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4-Fs ; 2 ) Major General George Lull added that U.S. physical fitness has actually deteriorated since World War I , largely as a result of poor distribution of medical care ; 3 ) Vice Admiral Ross T. Mclntire requested that the A.M.A. draft a " sound plan for medical care . " To cope with this problem , a five-man committee ( included : General Lull , Dr. Fishbein ) was appointed . <P> Also dealt with , but probably not for keeps , was Sister Elizabeth Kenny 's method of treating infantile paralysis . After two years of research , a special committee reported that : 1 ) just as many people recover from polio without Kenny treatment as with it ; 2 ) Sister Kenny 's concept of the disease ( TIME , Sept. 27 ) is wrong ; 3 ) her treatment is neither new nor unique . Retorted Sister Kenny , who was also in Chicago last week : " The A.M.A. report is the most criminal thing that ever happened in any work . . . a terrible thing to put out . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Penicillin . The meeting 's most popular feature was the lectures on penicillin . Dr. John Hinchman Stokes of Philadelphia reported excellent results with penicillin in late syphilis , showed slides of the handwriting of paretics to illustrate their dramatic improvement from illegibility to Spencerian clarity as treatment progressed . Other penicillin notes : <P> The Navy now authorizes the use of penicillin in all cases of gonorrhea . The few cases which do not respond to it are still treated with sulfa drugs and/or with artificial fever . <P> Penicillin cured 68 out of 69 cases of several kinds of meningitis at a Navy hospital . <P> Progress in Surgery . Radical splanchnicectomy ( removal of long segments of the nerves which serve the viscera ) is a lifesaver for certain types of high-blood-pressure patients . Dr. Reginald Smithwick of Boston has now perfected the technique so that deaths from the operation are rare . Some of his patients are in normal health six years after operation .
