The great brass bell across from the Assembly Hall on Pitcairn Island clanged gladly one sundown last fortnight . Through the dim light a ship had just been sighted , and the 200-odd hybrid descendants of H. M. S. Bounty 's , mutineers rushed out on Adamstown 's headland to strain eyes for their first visitor in over two months . <P> War had disrupted merchant shipping between New Zealand and South America , the infrequent calls of supply ships had ceased , essentials were running low . The works of Pitcairn 's powerful short-wave radio station , VR6AY , had broken down , and parts were in Panama being fixed ( TIME , Nov. 20 ) . A completely outfitted relief expedition had been called off because of lack of funds ( TIME , Dec.11 ) . The Christians , McCoys and Youngs were isolated and scared . <P> They hated their war rations-soggy bread compounded of coconut meat and milk , maize , lablab ( wild beans ) , arrowroot , flower petals ; coffee from roasted coconut shreds ; dried grass instead of tobacco-and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wheat flour , sugar , lard , potatoes , matches and all kinds of processed supplies . Worst of all , they feared disease . So , when the ship indicated it would stop , they eagerly gathered up the leaf baskets , wood carvings , woven hats and bird feathers , which are their dollars , quarters , dimes and nickels , and stood by their longboats in the crescent of Bounty Bay . <P> The visitor , guided by the island 's blinker and its own searchlight , eased in to an anchorage . The natives swarmed aboard . On deck they had a big surprise-the smiling face of Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd , genuinely happy to be of assistance , only incidentally pleased to find himself hip-deep in news again . <P> Last week the Admiral wired a report to the U. S. describing how the U. S. M. S. North Star put ashore relief supplies , which she would replenish in New Zealand ; her two doctors treated almost a quarter of the population for ailments , ranging from scratches to scurvy ; her machinists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Biggest treat of all : a long cinema program in the North Star 's saloon . The audience , most of whom had never seen films before , cried out in amazement at shots of Manhattan . Next day , when the North Star 's forward donkeys upped anchor and the screws began to turn , the natives stood up in their longboats and with tears in their eyes sang songs of farewell .
