Ballots v. Bullets <P> Sirs : <P> Re " Battle of the Ballots " in your Aug. 12 issue . <P> I , agree with Abe Lincoln , whom you quote in this article , that " among freemen there can be no successful appeal from the ballot to the bullet . . . . " But desperate circumstance sometimes requires desperate remedy . All that the G.I.s of Athens , Tenn. wanted was a fair count of their votes . And , more power to them , that is what they got . <P> <P> MEADE A. COLE Ajo , Ariz . <P> <P> Sirs : <P> Abraham Lincoln 's admonition . . . can properly be applied only against those who have lost an election and then attempt to reverse the decision by an appeal to force . That was not the case with the Athens veterans . ... It was the machine , not the veterans , who made the appeal to force . It was the veterans who were the forces of law and order . ... I think you owe it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lincoln 's fine statement with that point in mind . He said : <P> " It is now for them our people to demonstrate to the world that those who can fairly carry an election can also suppress a rebellion ; that ballots are the rightful and peaceful successors of bullets ; and that when ballots have fairly and constitutionally decided , there can be no successful appeal back to bullets ; that there can be no successful appeal , except to ballots themselves , at succeeding elections . Such will be a great lesson of peace : teaching men that what they can not take by an election , neither can they take it by a war ; teaching all the folly of being the beginners of a war . . . . " <P> <P> H. VAN RENSSELAER WILSON <P> Brooklyn <P> Sirs : <P> . . . The G.I.s were precedent followers rather than setters . Quite gloriously ( not ominously at all ) the pattern was cut for them in ' 76 . In this country , tyranny has found it tough going from way back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Extremely Popular <P> Sirs : <P> As one of the numerous and enthusiastic TIME readers in Holland , I wonder why the people of the U.S. appear to be so extremely popular with the greater part of my compatriots . <P> Is it because of the invaluable sacrifices your country made to restore our freedom or would it be for the grand way in which you have been helping us since V-day ? . . . <P> <P> ALPHONSE P. J. BOOM <P> Oegstgeest , Holland <P> More Men of Good Will <P> Sirs : <P> Being an enthusiastic reader of Jules Romains as well as of TIME , I take the opportunity of drawing your attention to a slight mistake . . . . <P> Referring to Jules Romains ' Men of Good Will TIME , Aug. 5 your editor writes it " has reached its 13th and penultimate volume . " In fact the Men of Good Will has just been finished , with 24 volumes , the last of which have been written in the States during the author 's wartime exile . . . . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divide by two for the correct answer . Romains has written 26 volumes for publication in France . They have been consolidated into 13 volumes in the U.S. The 14th ( Remains ' 27th ) is still to come. - ED . <P> <P> Buttinsky Damyankees <P> Sirs :
