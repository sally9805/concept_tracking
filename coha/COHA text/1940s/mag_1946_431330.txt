 | THE MOSt UNFORGETTABLE CHARACTER I 'VE MET By Hiram NavuJDL EVERYIlODY called him Toughy . One boy 's parents had been away during the three months since the youngster entered Toughy 's school , and when they came to see this place the boy introduced them proudly to members of the faculty . " This is Mr. Watson , this is Miss Craham , and this is our principal , Mr .. ? Toughy . " His face was crimson ; he could n't remember the principal 's name , for he had n't heard it since the opening day of school . To the three of us who were new to teaching , Toughy 's influence over the pupils in this private school for ys was incomprehensible . We could not understand how he could control them by " " talks . " He never seemed to have a disciplinary problem , while we had so far taught nothing but discipline . And even with so limited a program , I , for one , had not achieved notable success . At the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy and carried him into Toughy 's office . " Take him , " I said , " before I murder him . " It was my intention to resign that evening . But a half hour later this boy came back to class so quiet , so polite , so cooperative , that I changed my mind . When I asked Toughy what had happened he replied , his eyes twinkling , " We had a talk . " His authority was so quiet that we seldom had a chance to observe just how he got his results . But at last I asked him quite bluntly . " The first rule , " he said , " is not to allow a crisis to develop . It 's much harder to control a situation satisfactorily if it has reached the stage that calls for punishment . Never put a boy in the position where he can challenge or defy your instructions , and where , if he says the wrong thing , you 'll have to call his bluff . Never ask him if he 's done something wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempting him to lie his way out of trouble . " That was clear and concrete , and  | it made sense . " But I still ca n't fathom , " I said , " how you can always see trouble brewing . " " You have to know your boy , " Toughy replied . " It 's always there to see , long before it actually comes on . A tantrum does n't come without any warning from a well-adjusted boy . And with a small school , we have a real chance to know our boys . " Toughy required us to make a report every six weeks on each of ten or 12 boys , giving an estimate of each one 's character ? his initiative , adaptability , trustworthiness and other qualities . If , after reading a character report , parents of boys who needed correction were too indifferent to see where the finger pointed , Toughy would let them know , tactfully but honestly , what imminent trouble was brewing , and what they could do to help to avoid it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every noon some committee of boys met at lunch with Toughy or a teacher to plan programs or activities . One , called the Executive Committee , was really a cover name for Toughy 's Trouble-Shooters . No other award in school meant so much as membership on that committee . Once on it , you were on the inside ; you were working with Toughy to see to it that every boy was getting the encouragement and opportunity he needed to find himself . No member of the committee ever broke the trust invested in him : to keep secret the problems discussed there . Of course Toughy was not " tough . " On the contrary , he was the gentlest man I have ever known . But it was the sort of gentleness that comes from genuine strength . He made terrific demands on himself and on everyone else . For he expected everyone at the school to live up to his full capacity ; he asked . that you find your best self and keep constant pace with it . At first glance , there seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trim , intelligent-looking , his only unusual feature was a patch of white in hi early-graying hair . But as you saw more of him , . you became increasingly aware of the warmth and humor in his eyes , of the power of the well-shaped hands that were never restless or emphatic , and of the richness of his deep voice . By the time : you had been working with him year you wondered why such a ma was content to stay on as principal of a struggling little school co ducted in a frame house . For you were sure he could have his pick o any principal 's job . And , too , yo wondered where he had come fro ? in a deeper sense than the merely geographical . He talked little of himself , but I gradually pieced the story together . When Henry Mortimer returned from France and was discharge from the Army in 1919 he headed for art school . From boyhood days his fingers had itched for a drawing pencil and paintbrush . Now , in his  | late 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to get the training he wanted . For six months he studied in Chicago . It was clear to his teachers that this man had a brilliant artistic career before him . When he went back to Rochester to visit his parents during the spring holidays , he was bubbling with enthusiasm for his work . On the way back he stopped in Cleveland to see his uncle , who had started a boys ' school . It was an impulsive decision ; its effect lasted a lifetime . He found the new school sadly crippled . One of the teaching staff of four persons had left for another job . A second teacher had just gone to the hospital ? out for the rest of the school year . His uncle , trying to do the work of three men , was obviously worn out . Henry looked around him . There was something in the air in this little school that was arresting and exciting . It was apparent in the two remaining teachers ; it was vividly alive in the boys ( they did n't feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be forced to go home at the end of the day ) ; and it shone from his uncle 's eyes . He realized suddenly that he was breathing the same creative air he had found at art school . Only here the tools were not pencil and brush , hut mind and heart ; the medium was not paint and canvas , but human lives . " You 're tired out , " he said to his uncle . " Let me take your classes this afternoon . They may not learn much geography , but I think we 'll get along . " They got along . And that night at his uncle 's apartment he said abruptly , " If you 'll take me , I 'm staving . " It was not so easy as that . For weeks there were times when he yearned to get to the easel , when he felt that he had made a bad mistake . But the weeks grew into months , the months into years . And when at a dinner party one night he met a girl with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He married Helen Gallagher , and by the time I arrived at the school their baby boy was six months old . They were living in a small house near the school , which had thrived sufficiently to warrant moving it out into a suburb where there were open fields and country air . His uncle had retired , and Henry Mortimer had charge of the Lower School ( grades one through six ) . Henry Mortimer had become Toughy . Slowly I began to understand the principles behind Toughy 's success with boys . In the first place he loved boys , unashamedly and wholeheartedly . And since he loved them , he believed in them . I have seen him take on , with quiet confidence , boys of whom parents , friends , even child psychiatrists had despaired . " They have n't been handled right , " he would say . But he would hit the right combination . If Bill Graham was lazy and irresponsible , Toughy would  | heap responsibility on him . For instance , he would leave the next " town meeting " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no question about its working out satisfactorily . If Dan Billings was a buffoon whom everybody ridiculed , Toughy would call him in and ask him to serve as chairman of the Reception Committee , whose function was to escort guests around the school . Sometimes , of course , along would come a particularly hard customer who would tax even Toughy 's efforts . One was ten-year-old Douglas Hall , whose father had died while Douglas was a baby and whose mother had granted him his every whim . Douglas was devoid of physical fear , and of social responsibility . Once while he was roughhousing , his arm went through a windowpane and was ripped open from elbow to wrist . Ignoring the blood spurting from the jagged wound , he walked over to me and calmly said , " I guess something ought to be done about this . " Knowing that ordinary methods would n't work with Douglas , for a long time Toughy did nothing but cement a bond of friendship with the boy . He found out and shared Douglas 's interests ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We could n't see that Toughy was making great headway , but we had to admit that Douglas liked and respected him as he did no one else . So matters went for several months . Then carne a showdown . Dough began to feel his oats too much , an bullied other boys openly . It looked as though Toughy were finally going to fail . But one day I met Douglas coming down the hall crying . I stare Douglas crying ! It took me ten minutes to persuade him to tell me the cause , but he finally did . " I g kicked out of class , " he blubbered " and sent up to Toughy . And told me he ? he was disappointed in me . He said no ? good friend would let a friend down ? the way I did The crisis had been passed triumphantly , after a long campaign And I suddenly caught a glimpse how heroic Toughy 's patience was WHEN HEN I met Toughy an hour late and saw how tired and drawn hi was , I suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precarious business of reshaping young lives . Toughy 's love of and belief boys were matched only by his 1 of and belief in the sheer excitement of the learning process . This evident in all his classes . Under guidance , fifth- and sixth-grade geography and history took on the romantic glamour that boys usually found only in interplanetary comic books and the kind of radio programs which parents object . Toughy taught Early American History , for example , by making each boy in the class the governer of one of the original colonies . several weeks each student would  | with Toughy 's help , gather information about his colony . He would find the school library inadequate , and would spend Saturdays at the pubhe library . He would live in 17thcentury Massachusetts or Virginia or Rhode Island . Then would come the roundup . In a classroom electric with excitement , each boy had to answer in detail any pertinent questions about his colony that the other boys and Toughy could think up ? and they could think up some devilish ones . I remember how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 minutes , giving out answer after answer about crops , Indian attacks , government . Completely at ease across the reach of 250 ears , he would always begin , " Well , his is the way we handled that ? " PART of Toughy 's magic formula enfolded itself in those classes . Curiously or unconsciously , all of us ho teach or have taught want the most impossible combination of beug at one with our students ? at ome with their idiom , at ease in heir world ? and yet of not sinking their level of immaturity and thus relinquishing the guiding hand that Leers their activities . All good teachers approach this precarious balance ; Toughy is the only one I have ever en who maintained it without a lip of any kind . In the history game , he was one of them in a completely easy and natural give-andtake , as excited and eager as any the students . Yet he had only to say , " Are you sure about that , Dan ? " and a thoughtful and attentive silence would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day at lunch , and so engrossing that competitors would frequently forget to ask for a second dessert . One year some youngsters gave up afternoon play periods for months to construct a large cement relief map of North America in the school yard . Only an extraordinarily dull boy emerged from a year or two of Toughy 's geography classes without a Quiz Kid 's knowledge of boundaries , natural resources and topography . If we tried to compliment Toughy on his teaching , he would merely reply , " Thanks . Say , have you noticed what a great job Dave is doing in teaching his General Science class ? " or " Is n't that a first-rate idea of Gil 's to have the kids decorate the library with illustrations from their favorite books ? " Eventually , of course , Dave or Gil would tell the rest of us where the " great job " or the " first-rate idea " had originated ? in a conference with Toughy . Toughy 's enthusiasm for the job was contagious ; it spread through the faculty . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come back after supper , to plan and discuss . As a result , informal faculty meetings would be held night after night in which we discussed boys , methods and projects . The men on that faculty are scattered now , but we have n't forgotten Toughy , any more than the old boys  | have . He did as much for us as for the boys . In teaching us how to know and draw the best out of boys , he also taught us how to know and draw the best out of ourselves . Toughy had many tempting offers to head other schools at higher salaries . When I asked him why he had turned one such offer down , he looked embarrassed . " Why , I ca n't leave here , " he said , as close to angrily as I can remember . " This is where I belong . " So he did . He meant , first of all , that he felt he had a personal obligation to his uncle . This would always be his school , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said was true in a more general sense , too . Anybody belongs where he has found that he can utilize his powers to the fullest , where he can make every day exciting and enriching for himself and the people he works with . If I 've written of him as though his career were over , it 's because for me every thought of him is so clearly tied up with the days of the school in the little frame house . Actually the school has expanded and is still going , and Toughy is still the principal of its elementary grades . 11 was offered the principalship of this whole school , but turned it down , " I work best with younger boys , " he said . The frame house is gone ; the younger boys are now housed in big red-brick building with the old ones . The enrollment has increase the staff is larger . Everything h changed ? except Toughy . The last time I saw him I tried get him to tell me how he liked t changes in the school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its new surroundings . But 1 would n't talk about himself . " Say , " he exclaimed , and the old light shone in his eyes , " I want you to meet Dick Price , the new manila training teacher . He 's got the ho working on a great Christmas project . He has some wonderful ideas ! "
