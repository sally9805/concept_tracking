txt There is a noticeable tendency to " wait and see " before jumping to the conclusion that our problem of industrial organization for war has been solved finally by the appointment of Mr. Nelson and the creation of the new War Production Board . This is a healthy state of affairs . It is clearly understandable in view of the record of successive disappointments we have had . But it is already apparent that some of the more obvious defects of the past are now being corrected rapidly . Mr. Nelson has been given broad powers . He is using them to sweep away the overlapping and conflicting set-up that existed and to replace it with a system of divisional executives each of whom is given full responsibility and authority to do his job . - The new war board is the nineteenth major defense agency to be established since May , 1940 . It represents the fourth attempt to provide effective organization of defense production . As a result of this multiplication of agencies and succession of reorganizations there had developed such a tangle of interlocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships between them . It was difficult to tell who was responsible for what . In some things Mr. Nelson was Mr. Knudsen 's boss and in others Mr. Knudsen was Mr. Nelson 's boss , while no one except the President seemed to have 1 clear-cut authority . In place of this horizontal interweaving of uncertain responsibility Mr. Nelson is apparently establishing a straight-line , vertical progression of authority . He is on top , deriving his powers from the President , while under him there will be six divisional heads , deriving their authority from him . These division chiefs , in turn , will have their subdivisions , each also headed by a responsible official . Thus under the Division of Industry Operations some fifty branches of industry are to be organized with a government production officer in charge to speed conversion of facilities to defense , in consultation with labor and management . A start has been made by appointing as head of the Automotive Branch a former production manager for the Ford Motor Company , who is to receive , , according to Mr. Nelson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing about this reorganization , Mr. Nelson has abolished OPM , but he has wisely refrained from any wholesale " housecleaning " for its own sake . Such a course would obviously have wasted valuable experience and ability , and greatly delayed production until such time as the new officials could become acquainted with their jobs . In- stead , Mr. Nelson is taking over into the war production organization former officials of OPM who have proved their ability . Thus the continuity of the production program will be preserved . Presumably , as the program advances , changes will be made as the requirements of increased efficiency dictate . Mr. Nelson indicated that the new structure was subject to revision from time to tine . But for the present what he has done , in effect , is to set up a revised OPM , retaining the experienced personnel of that body , but giving it what was lacking before  --  ample and clear-cut authority to get ahead with the job .                   @ @
