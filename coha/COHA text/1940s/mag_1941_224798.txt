Eleanor Roosevelt likes to ask young musicians to perform at the White House , and young musicians naturally like to be asked . Last week Mrs. Roosevelt put on " An Evening of Songs for American Soldiers . " Six of the black and white performers were from a radio program : CBS 's thrice-a-week Back Where I Come From , a sustainer devoted to U. S. folk songs . Among the White House guests : the Secretaries of War , Navy , Treasury &; wives , the Chief of Staff of the Army , the Commandants of Marine Corps and Coast Guard , Mr. Knudsenhillman &; wives , Librarian of Congress Archibald MacLeish-whose **41;9155;TOOLONG , Alan Lomax , was master of ceremonies . <P> Chief white singer was Burl Ives ( full name : Burl Icle Ivanhoe Ives ) , who sang a ballad he picked up in Ohio , The Bold Soldier . A onetime Eastern Illinois State Teachers College footballer , Burl Ives bummed around the U. S. with a guitar . His specialty is Midwestern songs . The foot-tapping Golden Gate Quartet ( TIME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxi ( $100 round trip ) , sang Noah and Things Are Gon na Come My Way . Negro Joshua White , who sings at rehearsals with a lighted cigaret behind his ear , sang John Henry , Man Goin ' Roun ' Takin ' Names . <P> Back Where I Come From , directed by Nicholas Ray , comes mostly from the prodigious memories of Singer Ives and Scripter Lomax . Ives can sing for hours on any subject-love , death , the open road . For one ballad alone , There Lived an Old Lord on the Northern Sea , he knows 50 stanzas . When Woody Guthrie , " Okie " balladeer , was on the program , he and Alan Lomax spent an evening singing and listing songs about animals . In six hours they listed over 200 . They stopped only because the neighbors were complaining .
