txt Massachusetts communities , cramped with housing shortages , are swamping the State Housing Board with inquiries about the huge $200,000,000 state veterans housing program , due to start rolling soon . From all areas of the Commonwealth , requests for information and possible aid under the 20,000 housing unit program have been pouring in to the Board . " We 've simply been snowed under with inquiries since last Thursday ( April 1 ) when the Senate unanimously passed the housing bill to be engrossed , " Albert S. Bigelow , Housing Board Chairman , said today . Enactment of the program , which has received unanimous approval in both branches of the Legislature thus far , is expected this week . Governor Bradford , who in his annual message announced his support of the $200 , - 000,000 extension of state credit for local housing , is expected to sign the bill swiftly . Many Inquiries Among communities flooding the Housing Board with inquiries about the housing program are Boston , Cambridge , Springfield , Somerville , Worcester , Quincy , Fall River , New Bedford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a host of other smaller ones . In Cambridge today , City Manager John E. Atkinson , said the city was prepared to file application for State credit for 1,000 units as soon as the Governor signs the emergency bill . . Boston , which is entitled to some $48,000,000 , or about 4,800 housing units , under the measure , is studying the program hopefully . A city 's share is determined for the first 90 days of the law by the ratio of the city 's assessed valuation total to the State valuation total . Multiplying the city 's valuation total by 3 per cent is a quick way of arriving at the community 's share , Mr. Bigelow said today . The Boston total of $48 , - 000,000 is figured by multiplyinga valuation of $1,600,000,000 by the 3 per cent . Housing authorities in the cities and towns , or selectmen if there is no housing authority , may make application for permission to issue serial bonds for housing construction . The bonds will be backed by State credit , under the measure . Correcting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that total development costs of housing projects are included . That is the purchase of land , improvement of the land , and the actual construction of the housing units are all permitted under the program . " Cities and towns will not have to pay out a penny of their own tax monies under the bill , " Mr. Bigelow said . Backed by Bradford Construction of single houses , garden apartments , and multiple housing units will be permitted by the agency which administers the measure , Mr. Bigelow said , although more of the multiple units than the single type undoubtedly will be erected . The $200,000,000 housing program was recommended originally by the Special Legislative Commission to Study Problems Relating to Veterans , Including Housing and Hospital Facilities . It was headed up by Senator Mason Sears ( R ) of Dedham . Endorsement of the program was given by the Governor a few weeks later in his January annual message , and there has been little difficulty in passing it in the Legislature thus far . Both parties realize the need for housing as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwise today . Units will be rented at about $35 to $45 , according to Mr. Bigelow . Without doubt , the State Housing Board will have to be greatly expanded to meet the demands placed on it by such a program . Facilitation of this expansion is expected shortly when the legislative committees considering the question of expanding the board report out . Currently there is no provision in the State budget for exp , ansion of the Housing Board .
