" The building trades are a vast conspiracy against every boy &; girl who falls in love and wants to build a home . " <P> This pungent language came last week , not from a New Dealing trustbuster , but from suave , 44-year-old William Burnett Benton , advertising millionaire ( Benton &; Bowles ) and university vice president ( Chicago ) , now executive secretary of the Committee for Economic Development . ( C.E.D. is Big Business ' biggest attempt yet to take the lead away from Government in postwar planning . ) <P> Benton spoke at Cincinnati 's Hotel Netherland Plaza , where the American Institute of Architects and the Producers ' Council ( building equipment manufacturers ) last week gave a joint annual-convention banquet . Said he to the builders : 1 ) " Every policy of business that restricts employment or production should be re-examined " ; 2 ) the building industry is " notorious " as the No.1 practicer of " every form of so-called monopolistic practices " ; 3 ) it is also the kingpin of all industries in the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation 's total new capital formation . <P> Trouble is , as Benton pointed out last week , everyone in the building industry knows all this but no one has yet tried to do anything about it . On that score he left the builders with an ominous thought : if the industry does not " clean its own stables " someone else probably will . And , said straight-talking Benton , " if it takes a Congressional investigation " to break the building trade 's conspiracy against lovebirds , " many businessmen will be for it .
