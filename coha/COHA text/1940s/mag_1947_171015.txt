The House of Representatives ' special " show-me " committee arrived last week in London . Seventeen Congressmen , plus ten consultants and two secretaries-all under the supervision of Massachusetts ' stern and thoughtful Christian Herter-were there to see for themselves how badly off Europe was , and how much help England and the Continent needed . <P> The Congressmen cross-examined Food Minister John Strachey and were a little annoyed by his air of supercilious serenity . They were more impressed by Sir Stafford Cripps , president of the Board of Trade . Cripps said that Britain was bracing itself to get along without another U.S. dime , if necessary . <P> After lunching with U.S. Ambassador Lewis Douglas , the Congressmen flew off to Berlin . From there , General Lucius Clay 's special train for V.I.P.s trundled them to Essen , and a motorcade took them to Villa Hgel , the family mansion of the Krupps . <P> The Note-Takers . More than half the Congressmen were seeing Europe for the first time . They looked hard at the barefoot children , at the surly men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took out pads and pencils and made notes . <P> They split into smaller groups to visit mines , mills and workers ' homes . That shook them . After a visit to a cellar where a whole family lived in one room , one congressional investigator remarked : " I wonder how long I would live like this before I became a Communist . " A colleague cracked : " It would n't take two years of it to make Cox a Republican . " But no one laughed . Georgia 's ultra-reactionary Eugene ( " Goober " ) Cox was so moved that when he got back to the train he gave his sweater , necktie , other odds &; ends of clothing and all the chocolate he could buy to a group of Essen 's children who had gathered at the train shouting : " Uncle , uncle , chocolate , chocolate . " <P> What Do You Want ? Aboard the train , the Congressmen compared notes and saw some eye-openers . One group had questioned the eleven-man council of Germans who represented the workers in Essen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communists in your mines ? <P> <P> Council chairman : Yes . I 'm a Communist , about 40% of the miners are Communists , seven out of eleven of the council members are Communists . <P> Congressman : What do you want ? <P> Chairman : Four thousand calories a day , four weeks ' vacation a year and enough food for our families to fill the ration which they are supposed to get-1,500 calories a day . <P> Congressman : And what will you give ? <P> Chairman : As much coal as before the war . <P> Observed a suave British officer of the North German Coal Control : " That would be an excellent bargain but we 've not the food to give them . " <P> General Clay 's special train pulled out of Essen and trundled the Congressmen to Frankfort . There they all shook hands , split into teams and hurried off in all directions . This week the rest of the show-me committee was spread all over western Europe-in Paris , Brussels , Vienna , Rome-asking questions , taking notes .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
