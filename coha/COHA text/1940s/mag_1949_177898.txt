Although she was but 45 years old , Nukashook had about reached the end of her days . In the tiny village of Eelounaling on Boothia Peninsula , one of Canada 's northernmost Eskimo settlements , children regarded her as a cross and ugly old hag . The " spitting sickness " ( tuberculosis ) had long plagued her and her teeth were gone . One day last summer , while she lay coughing in her tepee , Nukashook called to Eeriykoot , her 21-year-old son . " I am suffering too much , " she said . " Put up the rope so I may kill myself . " <P> Eeriykoot , though he knew all about his people 's custom of mercy killings , protested . " This is against the white man 's wish , " he said . Replied Nukashook : " Then I must do it myself . " Faced with this resolution , Eeriykoot gave in . He persuaded his friend Ishakak to help . They tied the ends of a rope to the ridge pole of the tepee , then sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head in the loop , and her son pushed down on her neck until she was dead . <P> Justice over Ice . Last winter a white trapper who heard the story reported it to Mounties at Cambridge Bay . By plane and dog sled , two policemen went up to investigate . They found the guileless Eskimos-including Eeriykoot and Ishakak - perfectly willing to talk . The police arrested the two friends , exhumed Nukashook 's body for an inquest . <P> An autopsy showed that the woman had probably had no more than about three months to live , prompting one official to state privately that her killing " was the humane thing to do . " But the inquest also brought out evidence of a criminal offense , " aid . . . in commission of suicide . " The government had long known about this Eskimo custom , but never before had it had enough evidence to prosecute . <P> Prison Without Bars . From remote Cambridge Bay last week came an account of the trial . It took place in a Quonset hut normally used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a movie screen ) , the black-robed lawyers ( who sat at a ping-pong table ) and the parka-clad jury , Eeriykoot and Ishakak again explained how Nukashook had died . The defense argued that assisted suicide was merely part of the Eskimo 's way of trying to " match his harsh environment . " But the judge said the excuse was unacceptable . Eeriykoot was found guilty ; Ishakak was acquitted . <P> Although Eeriykoot 's crime carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment , he got only a year , which he will spend as a handyman around the Cambridge Bay police post . His only real punishment will be separation from home . For the primitively clannish Eskimos , that alone , the government hopes , will help make aided suicide an outmoded custom .
