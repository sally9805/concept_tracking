Ten to 16 thousand feet up in the Andes* lives a race of men with enormous energy and cast-iron hearts . Dr. Carlos Monge of Lima , Peru last week described that race , the highest in the world , to scientists at the University of Chicago 's 50th anniversary meeting ( see p. 63 ) . For his research he received an honorary degree . The thin Andes air kills weaklings . So the 12,000,000 Andes strong-hearts are the product of centuries of painful adaptation to scarcity of oxygen . In years of laboratory study . Dr. Monge found : <P> &gt; Andes natives have hearts remarkably long and thick . They beat very slowly , can do 20% more work than hearts of lowlanders . Even hard labor does not speed up a native 's heart ; in many cases , Dr. Monge discovered , a double load of work slows down the pulse . A native 's blood volume is larger than that of lowlanders , his veins are somewhat distended . His heart and circulation , said Dr. Monge , are like that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have noticeably greater strength than men at sea level . Most of them can climb a mountain " straight on . " <P> &gt; Almost all lowlanders develop mountain sickness , known as soroche , if they live above 10,000 feet . ( When flying at this level , aviators don their oxygen masks . ) The severity of soroche varies widely with different individuals : some ruin their hearts ; others become acclimatized in 15 or 20 years . <P> &gt; Dr. Monge first encountered mountain sickness in 1924 when an engineer stumbled into his office on swollen legs , gasping for breath . His face was bluish red , as though he had been choked , his eyelids were swollen , all the superficial blood vessels in his body appeared distended . He was weak , drowsy , suffered from spells of blindness and deafness . When he was taken down to sea level he was " completely cured . " Since then , he gradually worked his way up to 10,000 feet . Other victims , who look healthy , may go temporarily crazy . <P> &gt; Andean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Dr. Monge , " about 100,000 men come down to sea level for agricultural work , but after about three months . . . like the swallows . . . they go back to the altitude . " The doctor has accustomed himself to spend several weeks a year at his red brick experimental station in Huancayo 10,000 feet up ; after a few days he feels fine . <P> &gt; Many living creatures can not reproduce when they arrive at high levels . " The Spanish Conquerors , " said Dr. Monge , " . . . had no offspring until 50 years after the city of Potosi was founded . " But natives there since colonial days have a birth rate equal to that at sea level . <P> <P> * Highest point in the U.S.-California 's Mt . Whitney , 14,495 feet high .
