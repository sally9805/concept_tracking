. There were books around and a piano and none of the too-perfect look of the interior decorator . " I ) o you want a cocktail ? " she asked . " Or Scotch ? I have a little , and plenty of Scotch-type blend . " She wrinkled her nose over the last part . He stopped looking about the room and turned to her . She was different from last night , wearing some kind of dress with flowers printed along the bottom and fitting close up under her chin . " You really look so  --  never mind . " Compliments always sounded false . He went over to the piano . It was a large grand , too big for this room , undoubtedly a hangover from her married life . There were two books of Mozart sonatas open on the rack . One looked clean and new , the other worn. le riffled the pages of the old one and saw pencil marks for loud and soft , for the pedal , for an overlooked sharp or flat. " 1 ) 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The easy ones . Do you ? " " Not any more , but I 'm a sucker for music . " " I started taking lessons again this winter . " She stood near the piano . Ile turned the pages further , then closed the volume and looked at her without saying anything , studying her . She stool poised and quiet , letting him , and then moved away . " You still have n't said what drink . " " Whatever you have . Got any ideas about restaurants ? l'ni lost in this town . " " We 'll think that up when we start out . " She poured Scotch into an old-fashioned glass and put two lumps of ice into it from an ice bucket . The ice tongs were right on the tray , hut she ignored them and used her fingers . He did n't know why , but that pleased him . He took the glass and waited until she had a drink ready for herself . Ile raised his in a toast , said , " I Iere 's to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toasts , " he said . " I can never think of anything . " 40 " Here 's to never thinking of anything , " she said quickly . He thought it the most charming , the wittiest  --  and before he could finish the sentence he thought , Boy , it was n't that good . She was taking a sip of her drink , and he noticed her pursed lips . She started telling a funny thing that had happened at the nursery school that afternoon . She told a story well . The too-social tone was gone . Had he imagined it entirely ? One way or the other , it did n't matter any more . She had begun laughing at her own story , and he laughed with her . " You like kids , do n't you ? " " I seem to , " she said . " I 've got thirty . All stages from training pants to six years . They 're more exhausting than the factory ever was . " " What factory ? " " Did n't I  --  for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm not so much of an interviewer at that , am I ? What factory ? " It was her first job after her divorce , the first full-time job she 'd ever had . For the first year of the war , she had operated a drill press at Wright Aeronautical in Paterson . After a deep bronchial infection her doctor talked darkly of pneumonia , even tuberculosis , and ordered her to leave . " I guess I was n't hard to persuade , " she said . " After the first excitement , I hated it . " " I bet . " " Anyway , after a vacation , I got into the school . In those days nobody asked you if you had the proper training . I do like kids . " She asked about Tom , and he guarded himself against sounding boastful . He was a nice kid , fun to talk to and take places . He 'd made a good adjustment already to his new school . " It could be tough on a boy that age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school to a big city one and especially in the middle of a term . He 's O.K. , I guess . " Suddenly she smiled at him and saw his eyes go uncertain , as if he were unsure of why she had and were asking her not to wound him . She wanted to tell him that she knew more about his inner states than he had told her , that she knew he not only was n't happy now but had n't been for a long time , so that possibly he 'd forgotten how simple and good it was to feel happy . But she said none of those things . New YorkersHoule greatly personal remarks to each other on first or second meetings , but perhaps people from smaller places would get tied up with constraint and embarrassment . He 'd be miffed if he knew she thought of him as different from New Yorkers .

" She leaned toward hint earnestly . " Do n't be , Phil , you do n't have to be , with me or anylo1Iy " " It's -- well , I just " Ile broke it . Iile was touched , about what he did not know . Ever since Betty he had not found any girl who knew more about him than he chose to put into words . Communication with another human being , communication on the levels where words were needless , was something he had missed so deeply that recognition of it stirred sharply in hire . " I guess I cover on lots of things , " he said stiffly . " And when you do , you look  --  well , all sort of dark and brooding . " She suddenly added , " Like Toledo . You know , that landscape of El ( ; recd ? " He laughed . " You mean all dark greens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She nodded . " Practically a portrait of you . " She waited till he stopped laughing and then asked about the new assignment . He countered by telling her of the taxi driver . She said , " It 's sickening , is n't it ? " and they fell silent . A moment later , he suggested that she play for him . She went at once to the piano and began a simple Mozart sonata . Severaltimes she struck wrong notes and corrected them withoutnervousness or embarrassment . She played pleasingly , with no attempts to dazzle by speed or crashing chords . He sat listening to her in a slow suffusion of Gemiitlichkeit . Toward the end of the short sonata , he went over to stand by the piano , watching her hands . Looking down at her , he saw that her hair was not black as he had thought , but dark brown . She finished playing , stood up at once , and went back to her unfinished drink . He closed the book of music and set it atop the other volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He heard her laugh . " Sort of old-maidish , " he said sheepishly . " Or bachelorish . " " I like the way you play . " " I 'm glad . " Confidence , sureness , the freedom from his own **26;2170;TOOLONG  --  shehad that , and he envied her as he envied anybody else who was not forever involved with the weighing , the analyzing , the searching out he went through . She would not know the torment there could be in the fluctuating mood , the shifting decision , the wide swing between clarity and confusion , between cheerfulness and depression . Even though there were things about her that did n't seem to square with other things , she seemed direct , free of complication or self-question . " Another drink ? " she asked . " Or should we start ? I 'm starved . "  --  2 43When they were finishing dinner , she came back to the articles . This time he did not counter or dodge . " The thing 's got me licked so far , but that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flock of ideas about how to angle it , but they 're all lousy . " Briefly he told her two of them . She liked them , but he brushed that aside . " They just do n't stand up . When you get the right one , a kind of click happensinside you . It has n't happened yet . Let 's skip it . " It was about ten when they left the restaurant . He hoped , expected even , that she would suggest going back to her place , but instead she said there was a movie she 'd been watching the neighborhood playhouses for . A displeasure stabbed him , as if she 'd said something to offend him , but lie agreed that a movie was a fine notion . In the deep loge seats , he felt placated ; watching the screen , he was conscious of her nearness , of whether her arm was on the scat rest or not , of her breathing . Each time she fished in her purse , he offered her a cigarette  --  leaning close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The afternoon 's unspokenadmonition not to hurry this sounded again in his mind . I lc kept his eyes on the picture , but every time she moved her head , recrossed her legs , shifted about in any way , he knew it . Was this to be like all the rest ? His lips closed hard against each other as though to keep out the bitter taste of the question . I le glanced toward her . Her whole attention was on the screen . In the dim light she seemed guileless and very young , and he believed at last in what she had told him about her divorce leaving no residue of bitterness or hatred . She had undoubtedly known pain  --  what human beingcould finish nearly three decades and be a stranger to it ? But she seemed whole and unchipped in her personality , with none of the braced expectation of further pain . Across the veil of silence between them , Kathy was think-44ing , And maybe I 've forgotten how simple and good it is to feel happy . She had n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill . She had n't really sufferedabout anything since those long-ago days back home , in her teens . But it suddenly seemed a long time since she 'd known the outrageous delight in life that she 'd felt over going to college or getting married . For her , living alone was a stopgap . Three years was a great deal of stopgap indeed . There were good things about marriage that she 'd begun to miss . Small things , apart from the big question of rightnessand love . The comfortableness of always having somebody to go to a party with , the normal knowledge that you were a man 's wife like everybody else  --  marriage was a sweet way to live . Or could be . She glanced over at him . He was concentrating on the movie . He 'd be shocked probably if he could see past the thin casing of her skin into her mind . Mrs. Schuyler Green . She was amused . That was the adolescent trick ; every time she 'd met a new boy , she 'd instantly thought of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd write out his name and then hers beneath it and cross off all the matching letters in each . There was some childish abracadabra for the remaining letters . What was it ? " Rich man , poor " No , that was even younger nonsense , before the dreamy days of thinking about boys . Her mind blanked out  --  she could think of nothing . Rich man , poor man  --  her childhood had been spent with that differentiation . The fact that as a small-town lawyer , her father was too poor to do the things he wanted to do for his wife and his two children had embittered him long before she and Janey were old enough to show they wanted things they could n't have . Probably his owA bitternesshad helped teach them that differentiation. 45 " Love , friendship , marriage , hate . " Suddenly the boy-girl rigmarole tumbled back into her possession  --  fortunetelling for adolescence . She tried to do the trick in her mind . Should I take Schuyler Green and Katherine Pawling ? Or Philip Green and Katherine Lacey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open her bag , but across the arm of the chair , he offered her his pack of cigarettes . She took one , and he flipped his lighter . The sleeve of his coat touched her bare arm , and in the small flare of light she suddenly looked at him and whispered , " This is nice , is n't it ? " As they came out to the street , he said , " And now ? " " Would you mind if we did n't go anywhere else ? During the week I just never get enough sleep any more . " " ( ) f course I would n't mind . " 1 le heard how formal his words sounded . Did they show his disappointment ? He felt a fool . In the taxi he sat well away from her . At her house , he loudly told the driver to keep the fl ; rg down , took her to the door , and was the first to say good night . Secret and abject , a wish twisted in him that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nightcap . She said it had all been lovely , and was gone . A hundred notions discarded , sentences x-ed out , opening paragraphs , phrases for titles . Attempts at a dry underwriting , at a just logic and reason , attempts at ringing words . And always the distaste , the dejection , the renewed batteringat his mind to yield , to create , to reward him . Phil reached to the top of the paper in his typewriter and wrenched it out of the machine . The platen whined like line singing out of a steel reel . " Damn it , I 'll go nuts . " For nearly a week he had fought the increasing sense of46failure . Or was it boredom ? He had heard nothing from Minify and had neither telephoned nor gone to see him . He had read with minute care all but six or eight of the borrowed clippings ; he had made twenty appointments for the following week with head people in each of twenty organizations . He delayed the interviews because experience had taught him that each one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with his own plans already formulated , so he could pin the ready talker down to pertinent material . He had given himself a week 's leeway ; now he knew it was n't enough . He still had no plan . The " angle " refused to show itself . Again and again some clipping would rouse him , and his quickened feelings would carry assurance that he was on the edge of discovery . But an hour later he would know that all he had was one more episode of a store window smashed in Boston , a child kicked and beaten in WashingtonHeights , a synagogue or cemetery ravaged in Chicago or Minneapolis or Detroit . " This Christ-bitten stuff wo n't budge . " He considered telling Minify that he 'd prefer , after all , to leave this for his second assignment , that he 'd surely strain less after he 'd rung up one good record in the new job . Something stopped him from doing it . He had a stubborn streak . " It 's a mile wide right now , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe he could make each article a kind of Profile of some Jewish guy who 'd been heroic in the war , decorated , all that . Nonsense . Heroes were heroes because they were heroes , not because they were or were n't Jewish . Even offering such a selection  --  what the hell was different betweenbeing brave if you were a Jew and being brave if you were n't a Jew ? My trouble is , he thought , the only difference that rates47with me is people 's sex . The notion amused him . I do care whether somebody 's a woman or a man . He had not telephoned Kathy all week . Until he felt betterabout the first stage of this job , he was in no mood for personal things . Or was it the other way round ? IIe shoved back from his desk and stood up . She 'd been on his mind too damn much , that 's what it was . Any man , meeting her after months of nothing  --  hell , no wonder he could n't get on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called her at the school . She said , " Oh , Phil , hello , " as if she were glad . " You would n't be free tonight by any chance ? " He admiredhis offhand tone . " No , I 'm not . I 'm sorry . " " Then how about tomorrow ? " " I 'd like that . How 's the work coming ? I 've wondered about it a lot . " " It 's not . I 'm still rooting around for some special lead-in , and I just ca n't hit it . " He sounded cheerful . " You 're responsiblefor the hell I 'm in . You sold Minify . " " You 'll get it , Phil . I know it . " She made a comforting sound . " About seven then ? " This time lie was n't irritated that somebody else was sure . It delighted him . The whole call delighted him . She had thought about the series ; she had thought about him . He looked triumphantly at the telephone . Tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last time , for all he knew , she 'd waited for him to suggest it . Maybe Minify , too , was waiting for a signal from him . At any rate , there was no reason to avoid him this way . Often a suggestion from somebody else , even when you rejected it , picked you up from the sticky muck you 'd been working in . He went to the telephone once again . An hour later they were deep in discussion . One by one , Phil checked over the ideas he 'd had , the reasons for throwingeach one aside . There was no surprised look on Minify 's face , no careful choice of words to conceal disappointment . Minify knew . Before he turned editor , he 'd written too many thousands of newsprint columns himself , too many dozens of special articles for magazines , not to know . His eyes intent , he listened carefully as Phil told him of the material he had already gathered . " The more you give me , the surer I am I want the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nasty for fair . " Phil looked briefly at Minify . " One of my sisters was here last week from Detroit . She always gets me on edge , but I used to think she was O.K. underneath . I told her what I was up to , and she went into a routine about you ca n't write or legislate these things out of existence . ' " " Yeah . I get lots of that . " " A few years ago she would n't have said that  --  anyway , not in that pleasant , smug tone . I guess in a place that 's running over with the Negro thing and the Jewish thing  --  I suppose I ought to go out there . " He considered Detroit . " But you know something ? " Minify waited . " I 've a hunch there 's a bigger thing to do than just to go after the crackpotstory . That 's been done plenty . It 's the wider spread of it I 'd like to get at  --  the people who 'd never go near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. K. Smith . " " I 'm with you on that . But it 's harder . " They sat across from each other , smoking , silent . Just in this companionship of searching , Phil found it easier to think . His thorny mood was smoothing out . He let his thoughts drift . " I wish Dave was n't in Europe , " he finally said , almost to himself . " Who 's he ? " " Dave Goldman . We were kids together , in California . " He waved largely . " Undying friendship at eight . " He looked reflective . " I wonder what he feels like when he runs into it or reads about it . He 's in the Engineers . Seems stuck over there . Captain . " " Still friends ? " " Not especially close any more . We went through everythingtogether up to college . Then I picked Stanford , and he went to UCLA . We still write every so often . But letters are no good on this kind of business . I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little forward as if he were trying to hear a sound very far away . Then he said slowly , " Maybe there 's something in that . " " Going to suggest my sending you abroad ? " Undisturbed by the joshing tone , Phil shook his head . Ile reached for a cigarette , forgot to make the gesture of offering one . " I 'm going to start on a new tack , " he said slowly . " So far I 've been going after facts , evidence . I 've sort of ignoredfeelings . " He shifted his glance to Minify . " How does it make somebody like Dave feel ? The way we feel only stepped up ? " He spoke more quickly . " It 's at least a chance to break the log jam . " " ( got any Jewish friends in New York ? " Minify asked . " Who , me ? I have n't any friends in New York . " " I 'll introduce you to Joe Lieberman . He 's a physicist and a good guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oak Ridge . " Phil put his hand up , in a " stop " gesture . " Hold it for now , would you ? It 's no use till I know what I want to ask him . I ca n't just say , How do you do , Professor Lieberman , let 's talk about how you react to antisemitism . ' I 'd fall on my face first . " 50John Minify laughed with him . " Joe 'd get it , " he said . " He 's the man you could say it to , once I gave him a line on you . " They agreed to keep the meeting in reserve . Phil rose to go , anxious to explore this new path that had just opened to him . At the door , he turned . Minify looked quizzical , obscurely pleased with life or himself . " Thanks for letting me barge in , " Phil said . " Any time . " He smiled . " You made a hit with Jessie , " he said . " And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It sounded too abrupt . " They made a hit with me , too . " " She 's quite a girl , Kathy . She has a lot on the ball . " Phil wanted to say the urbane , the perfect thing , but he could n't think for the life of him what that would be . He said , " She 's damn attractive , " added , " Well , be seeing you , " and left . Even on the way home , the big new question was on him like a seizure . Over and above what any other normal man thinks about it , what must a Jew feel about this thing ? That 's what he must find out , thinking himself into the very brain of another human being to find his answer . It was a fascinating quest for any speculative guy . It was a human question , it was dramatic . Out of it should come the way to lead readers along . For the rest of the afternoon and again after his early supper with Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room , sitting at his desk , getting up again to wander around and stare vacantly at his books  --  hour after hour he persisted . Without purposely or consciously limiting his interest , he kept coming back to Dave , trying to think into Dave 's mind . It was more valid to think of someone like Dave , the kind of man he himself would be if he were a Jew . He could not " think into " a deeply reli-51gious old Jew in a prayer shawl , or into the poor , ignorant Jewish peddler behind a pushcart on the East Side , or into the wealthy tycoon in business . The deeply pious , the truly ignorant , the greatly powerful of any creed or religion were beyond his quick understanding . Dave was not . Dave was like him in every essential , had the same boyhood patterns , the same freedom from either extreme of poverty or wealth , the same freedom from any creed-bound faith . They had both grown up in a generation when religion did not work itself very deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? fear ? or contempt ?  --  would be the feeling of Dave as a man , and not Dave as a Jew . Dave as citizen , as American , and not Dave as a religious being . That , Phil was sure of . And that was good . He began to glance through his hundreds of notes , pausingover this episode or that to ask himself what would go on in a man like Dave when he read of it in his morning newspaper . Betty 's paperweight sat on top of the thin sheaf of clips which he had not yet read . Idly he picked up the heavy chunk of glass and began tossing it from one hand to the other . His eyes were on the top clipping where the oval outline of the paperweight still showed , like the imprintof a doctor 's thumb into the puffed flesh of edema . It was the first page of an issue of Time magazine , nearly two years old . He began to read it . Congressman John Rankin had stood up in the House to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winchell as " the little kike I was telling you about . " His fingers tightened around the cold smooth glass . Time 's next words were , " This was a new low in demagoguery , even for John Rankin , but in the entire House no one rose to protest . " Shame for the Congress twisted in him . He read on through a column and a half to Time's52sentence : " The House rose and gave him prolonged ap-plause . " The House . The Senate . The great Congress of the United States . He stood up abruptly . " Jesus , what 's happening to this country ? A country never knows what 's happening to it . " How many of Time 's million readers had felt like rushing down there , punching Rankin in the jaw , yelling at the whole House ? And if a reader were Jewish  --  could he be any more outraged ? What had Dave felt when he 'd come on this ? The same , exactly the same as he himself did . He 'd bet a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass in his hand was moist . He set it down and wiped his hand against his trousers . He thought he knew . There was that good familiar click of certitude he always felt when his instincts were true . But there was no way to check on himself , no way to prove he was correct . He would have to write Dave after all , have to get to know this Joe Lieberman , have to do personal research on this as he did on every other problem he had ever worked on . " How do you do , Professor Lieberman , let 's talk about how you react to antisemitism in the good old U. S. A. " Damn it , he 'd die first . " Dear Dave , Give me the lowdown on your gizzard when you read about Rankin calling people kikes or a Jewish kid getting his face slashed by Jew haters in New York City . " Out . It was out . All of it was out . There was no way he could dig and prod and tear open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind alley , too . He turned on the radio . In an instant he snapped it off . He picked up the evening papers . The news was stale . Ile thought of writing letters and abandoned the idea . It was53only eleven ; if he went to bed , he 'd never sleep . Again he 'd felt himself pressing the hard edge of discovery ; again he 'd slipped right through it . Like the oily turnstile . Flickering across his mind was a wonder about whether he was losing his grip for a while . It happened to writers . Maybe it was his turn . Grimly he told himself not to start yammering . His gaze traveled slowly over the room as if he were looking for affirmation that other writers had fought and struggled for an idea . Books  --  the room was full of books . Books told about people 's feelings , private reactions . There had n't been many novels where the main characters were Jewish , but there 'd been some . For half an hour he searched the shelves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring himself to throw any hook away , so one or two of the ones he remembered owning ought to be somewhere in this conglomeration . Whatever novels he had were old . He 'd heard of a couple of new ones in the last year that dealt with " the Jewish problem , " but he was n't much of a novel reader , so he 'd missed them . He 'd have to ask about them , buy them for whatever lie might learn from them . I lc finally found one of the books he 'd expected to find , and lie renewed his search . Then he had two more . He 'd known they ought to be there , and they might help him now with his job of " thinking into . " As he remembered these books , their central characters had been Jewish . He began to reread , rapidly skimming , suddenly remembering the people , plot , incidents . For more than an hour he read . And as he read a sickish anger grew in him . He stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by side on a shelf . Ile stared at them . One , two , three in a row . Exhibits A , B , and C.54In each of these novels the central figure , the Jew , was a heel  --  dishonest , scheming , or repulsive . A Goebbels , a Rankin might have written these books . But in each case a talented Jew had been the author . It was before the war that each had done it . But he had done it . Somewhere in the 1930 's each had labored long and done it . What dark unconscious hatreds must have been operating in those very authors that made each of them , with a world of subjects to pick over , finally choose these subjects and stay unswerving to their purpose through the long months and loneliness of writing ! How neurotic they themselves must have been made by the world of hatred ! Did it never occur to one of them to write about a fine guy who was Jewish ? Did each one feel some savage necessity to pick a Jew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewwho was a swine in the movies , a Jew who was a swine in bed ? He would have to look elsewhere for any valid clue to what a normal Jew would feel about anything  --  a Jew who was a scientist , say , or a historian , or a businessman , or a housewife . Or a Jew who 'd risked maiming or death in the war against the master-race theory . He sat down and wrote quickly on his typewriter . Dear Dave : When the hell you getting back ? And will it be a surprise to know we 've moved to New York for good , or did I say I was going to , last time I wrote ? I 've taken a staff job with Minify . I want to talk to you about a series I 'm supposedto do , on antisemitism ; do you hyphenate the damn word or not , I never can remember . Anyway , what chance your stopping here for a bit before heading for the Coast ? Best , and where 's the letter you owe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wrote , " AIR " beneath them , checked on Dave 's APO number , and went down to the street to mail the letter . Even this much decisiveness feels good , he thought . He could almost taste his own disgust and bile . IHc dreamed of Betty . For the first time in months , she was there in his angry sleep , young as she had been , asleep beside him and smiling at something . Somewhere was the sound of an infant 's thin wailing , and she was n't startled , just smiling , calling out , " Yes , darling , I 'm coming . " There was such readiness in her voice , hurrying to her baby , unruffled , not resentful at being waked . Ile turned on his back and knew he had dreamed . " You 're afraid to let on to anybody about it , are n't you ? Do n't be , Phil , you do n't have to be , with me or anybody . " That was Kathy , his sleep-filled mind told him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the overwash of two voices , the second flowing over the first like a new wave rolling in on the outgo of the preceding . Different yet one because each was of the indivisible sea . Now he sat up , really awake . He turned on the light above his head and reached for a cigarette . An extraordinary sense of peace ran through him as he remembered the dream and the half dream it had borne with it . I lc swallowed , and it made a hard , audible sound in the silent room . Ile heard it and contemplated the tip of his cigarette . he thought , I guess I 'm in love with her . He lay , still armed with sleep , freed from the incessant striving of the evening , relaxed as a man basking under a summer sun on an unpeopled beach . He heard again her voice on the telephone that afternoon , open , eager . All the complex wariness he 'd felt that first time was gone . The doubts were gone . That was good . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis of himself was bad enough ; minute analysis of others was a preposterousnonsense , an unspoken effrontery . She was on no witness stand under cross-examination , with him the prosecutor ; she had nothing to prove , with him the dissenter .

She could , but after a while would she feel cheated ? Oh , quit being a self-appointed bastard of a judge and jury and God . He turned out the light . Illogically , he rememberedBelle 's visit a week before . Sleep was invading his mind again , like a slow infiltration into resisting terrain . He felt the cold December night in the room , the realm of warmth under the blankets . A sound came to him , thin , miserable . For one instant he thought he was dreaming again about Betty and the baby . Then he jerked free of his blankets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the dark apartment . His mother had called aloud in the night and then there had been a long silence and now she was calling again . " Mom , what ? " The switch clicked under his finger . " You 're sick . " She moved her head . Her face rigid with pain , her hand bluish across her breast , the fingers digging into her left arm  --  fear assaulted him , and the memory of himself as a small boy wondering what he could do to bear it if his mother ever died . " Heart ? " he said . " Does it seem your heart ? " She moved her head again . He stooped over her , his arm cradling her , not knowing whether to raise her or lower her from the propped-up pillows. 57 " I thought I dreamed it . " He went out into the hall . Quietly he opened the door to Tom 's bedroom . In the dim light from the doorway the slight mound under the blankets seemed motionless . He went to the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing came up to him . For a moment he remained , listening . " Better , " she whispered . " Wait . " He left her as she was . He took the glass of water on the table , held it to her lips , knew enormous relief that she could sip from it . He pressed her shoulder as if to reassure her that this was nothing , hearts were nothing , age and death and pain were nothing . " Mom , are you all right ? Is it easier ? " " It 's passing . " She looked at him . Regret was in her eyes , apology in her voice . " I 'll get a doctor . " Doctor ? What doctor ? In all this city he did n't know the name of one doctor . " I 'll phone Minify or Kathy and ask . " He started for the door , stopped , turned . " Can I leave you ? Are you really better ? " " Wait another minute . " Her right hand fell away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The attack must be over . She had never been really sick in her life and now she was sick , struggling with this first onslaught of deep sickness . He sat on the edge of her bed . He would get a maid for the work ; they would move where there was no flight of stairs to strain her . " Now , " she said . She moved , sat forward , and then care- fully lay down again . " Angina , " she said . " I 'd never realized the pain was so sharp . " As if it were a startling idea , he re- membered his father had been a doctor ; she and the girls and he himself knew far more than the usual layman about symptoms and disease . " I 'm going to phone Minify , " he said . " He 'll know a heart man . " " What time is it ? " " It does n't matter . " Ile went to the window , closed it , and then went to the fireplace . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match . The wood , dried and ready , crackled . " It 's nice , " she said . " You did n't hear the first time I called . " CHAPTER FOURcc A , ILL sHE  --  Dad , will she die ? " V V Phil turned , saw the stricken eyes watching him . He wanted to ease that look away , lie if necessary to replace it with confidence . But always he 'd played it the other way , and he would now . Answers had to be answers . " She 'll die sometime , just the way you will or me or Aunt Belle or anybody . But maybe it wo n't be for a long time . " " Oh , Dad . " He put his hand on Tom 's head , ruffling the dark hair . " The doctor said she might be fine for years if she 's careful . She 's pretty old , and all the packing and unpacking tired her too much . " Tom moved closer . Phil pushed the lever of the toaster down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some clothes , Tom . " He gave him a shove toward the door as if they were roughhousing . " Then you can set the table . We can run this place between us , I bet . " " All right . " He started to leave , then stopped . " Oh , gosh , Dad . " " It 's scary , Tom , I know . I was scared last night , too . But we 'll take care of her , and she might be just fine till you 're grown up and married and have kids . " The shoulders relaxed . Phil heard him tiptoe down the hall . " Nothing to worry about . " A dozen times Dr. Craigie 's words had come back . With them had come again the **25;2198;TOOLONG of the sleeping city around the lighted bedroom , the knowledge that between her first calling out and her second , there 'd been the time to dream , to wake , to6oponder the sense of peace and continuing life , all unknowing that across a dark hall a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , if they take care , " Dr. Craigie had said . The quotation marks around " hearts " had been cheery , a comfortable dismissing . " It may prove to be what we call false angina instead of the true angina . She 'll sleep well now , and you keep her in bed for a few days , and then we 'll get her to the office and really see . Angina is actually a symptom rather than a disease  --  some circulatory deficiency , perhaps , or a kind of anemia of the cardiac  --  well , no use getting too technical this time of the night , Mr. Green , is there ? " No , do n't get technical . Be calm , pleasant , willing to be routed out of bed , reassure the patient that the sensation of dissolution was merely part of the clinical picture , like the choking off of air , the sword in the arm . " I never minimize in a sickroom , " his own father had once told him . " I do n't frighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't either . John Minify had called him " one of the best in New York . " Perhaps the suave voice was only a mannerism , acquired , too . I must call Kathy , he thought , and break tonight . The day sped remarkably . There was a curious ease to this kind of work , something like that week on Guad , with the mind nailed to the automatic directions for the next step . Life could be a simple thing of small actions on a string . Cook this , get the tray ready , take it in to her , straighten up this room , that room , phone the market , wash dishes , keep Tom quiet , go in now and talk to Mom , she 's awake again , get Tom to bed , wash the dishes . No time for big thinking , no time for foreign policy , losing the peace , badgering your mind . Just do this , then do that . Easy . It was the first day since he 'd got the assignment that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little like 6idesertion , but for cause . At nine in the evening , with Tom gone to bed and no further chores to do , he still avoided the waiting morass . There was no use ; he was too tired to think . He had telephoned Kathy to explain why he could not see her . She gave him quick sympathy and offered to find a maid . " At least a temporary one , Phil , what they call an accommodator . ' " Thanks , Kathy , it 's  --  well , thanks . I could phone my sister Belle in Detroit to come for a few days , but she gets me down too much . " He hung up , and began to pace the room . A , B , and C were still side by side as he had left them last night . He looked at the three books listlessly . His fatigue deepened . I-lc had not gone back to sleep after Dr. Craigie had left , nor had he slept all day . It was just as well he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of block on the whole damn thing , he thought . If I could dig and pry into some decent Jewish guy , I 'd get it . Scalpels of the interviewer . The incision . The probing . You just ca n't do things to human beings that you do to a Manila envelope full of clips . Today when Mom had said , " I 'm nearly seventy after all , dear , " he 'd wanted to ask , " Are you afraid ? Is it awful to know you might die soon ? " There were questions no one could speak . I le would know the answers to those two only when he himself was seventy . It was that way about every question that mattered most , about every question whose answer lay in the heart . Yet he had got answers in the past . " Every art isle you 've done for us , Phil , " Minify had said , " has a kind of human stuff in it . The right answers get in it somehow . " Sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . When he 'd wanted to find out about a scared guy in a jalopy 62with his whole family behind him hoping for a living in California , he had n't stood on Route 66 and signaled one of them to a stop so he could ask a lot of questions . He 'd just bought himself some old clothes and a breaking-up car and taken Route 66 himself . He 'd melted into the crowds movingfrom grove to grove , ranch to ranch , picking till he 'd dropped . He lived in their camps , ate what they ate , told nobody what he was . He 'd found the answers in his own guts , not somebody else 's . He 'd been an Okie . And the mine series . What had he done to get research for it ? Go and tap some poor grimy guy on the shoulder and begin to talk ? No , he 'd damn well gone to Scranton , got himself a job , gone down into the dark , slept in a bunk in a shack . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been a miner . " Christ ! " He banged his fist on his thigh . His breath seemed to suck back into his lungs . The startled flesh of his leg still felt the impact of the blow . " Oh , God , I 've got it . It 's the way . It 's the only way . I 'll be Jewish . I 'll just say  --  nobody knows me  --  I can just say it . I can live it myself . Six weeks , eight weeks , nine months  --  however long it takes . Christ , I 've got it . " An elation roared through him . He had it , the idea , the lead , the angle . A dozen times he could have settled for some other idea , but each time he 'd thrown it away , tossed it , profligate , stubborn . He 'd known that there was somewhere , around some unexpected corner , a better idea , stronger , more real , the only . He 'd stalked it , beseeched it , spied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he 'd found it , this burst of recognition shouted out from him . " I Was Jewish for Six Months . " That was the title . It leaped at him . There was no doubt , no editing , no need to wonder . That would get read . That there was no passing63up . Six weeks it might be , ten , four months , nine , but apart from that one change , it was it . Nobody but another writer could know how goddam good I feel , he thought . This was the reward , the strange compelling excitement of getting an idea . Resistance to the series was a vapor , remembered but gone . Nothing could stop this . It would be simple enough . He did n't look Jewish , sound Jewish , his name was n't Jewish  --  well , Phil Green might be anything ; he 'd skip the " Schuyler " and not have to bother with assumed names . He checked on himself in his mind 's eye  --  tall , lanky ; sure , so was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys who were Jewish . He had no accent or mannerismsthat were Jewish  --  neither did lots of Jews , and antisemitism was hitting at them just the same . His nose was straight  --  so was Dave 's , so were a lot of other guys ' . I le had ( lark eyes , dark hair , a kind of sensitive look  --  " the Tolerla , " Kathy had said . Brother , it was a cinch . In California , no , he could n't get away with it anywhere on the Coast . Too many people knew him there ; he 'd keep running , into them , spoiling things . But here  --  for once he was delighted with his shyness , with his inability to make friends . I le 'd meant to hang around the office and meet people , writers , editors , but he had n't gone in even once . He did n't know a soul in this whole damn city , except Minify and Kathy  --  they 'd see it , they 'd be as excited as he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for morning to tell her , to tell Minify . He 'd phone them right now . No , this was no thing for phoning . " Phil . " From the bedroom , his mother 's voice sounded strong , ordinary . Ile went in . She looked better ; her color was good . " You do n't have to stay in , " she said . " I feel all right . " 64 " Do n't crowd things . " He looked at her inquiringly . " Feel like talking ? " She sat forward from the bunched pillows . " Of course . " " I 've got it . I 've got the way to get that series . This is n't like any of the other ideas I told you . " " It must be right , " she said . " It always is when you 're this sure . " " I 'm going to be Jewish , that 's all . Just tell people I am and see what happens . See what I feel like . For a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , Phil . It 's brilliant . " " It wo n't be the same , sure it wo n't , but it ought to come damn close . " He was almost shouting but he could n't decreasehis voice . " It 's worth a try  --  just put myself into every situation I can think of where being Jewish might mean something . It 's so simple . See ? " " Of course . It 's wonderful , really . " " Then I 'll write stuff they 'll read . " He rubbed his thigh . He looked down at her as if she had done him a favor . She 'd got it ; he 'd known she would . " If we do have a maid tomorrow , " he said , " I 'll go tell Minify . And that girl I told you suggested the series , I want to tell her about it . " " Ca n't you invite them down here now ? I 'm not going to need anything . " He looked at his watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to him in less than twenty minutes ? After two weeks of sweating it out day and night ? Where did ideas come from , anyway ? This one had leaped at him when he 'd been exhausted , AWOL from his search . Sometimehe 'd have to try to trace back every step he 'd taken . Not now ; he had no time now . " That 's an idea . " He started for the door . " Will you 69keep my secret if you meet any new people ? It 'd have to be without exceptions , you know , to work at all . " " If you 're Jewish , I am too , I guess . " She waved him out of the room . He went to the telephone , dialed Kathy 's number . " It 's me , Phil . I never thought you 'd be in . " " How 's your mother ? You sound as if she were better . " " She is , lots . Kathy , you have n't a date ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just wrapping presents . Why ? " " I ca n't leave her alone here . I 'd be afraid to . But I 've got it at last , and I thought , I mean , I 'd give a lot to tell you about it . " " The angle ? What is it ? " " You would n't  --  have you any feeling about getting in a cab and coming over for a bit ? " It was awkward , saying it . He did n't care . " It 's just I 'd hate to go into it on a phone and I 'm pretty set up . " " I 'll be there in half an hour . What 's your address again ? " He went to the kitchen for ice cubes . He went to his room , changed his shirt , looked in the mirror , and rememberedhe had n't shaved till afternoon , anyway . Then he went into the bathroom and got out the electric razor he almost never used . Once over quickly would do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd see what a gold mine of a thing this was . Nothing phrased . His mind raced . There 'd be snags , complications , problems . So all right . Every second made him surer that there 'd be validity to what he 'd find in himself as time went on . There was no rush . Nlinify had told him that two or three times . If it did take six weeks or nine months Nine months . He did n't usually think in platitudes , yet he kept coming back to this one . He knew he could n't delay66the series for that length of time , rush or no rush . He was using it as a device to get at something arcane and buried . He put the razor down and lit a cigarette . He smoked half an inch of it before he noticed that the razor was still buzzing . He clicked it off and nodded to his image in the mirror . Yes , that was it . That 's what he 'd been trying to articulateto himself . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Just as the embryo in the womb reproduced in nine months the whole evolutionary process of the race , maybe he could reproduce in himself in a short time the whole history of persecution " I wish she 'd get here . " He finished shaving and went in to his mother 's room once more . " Want anything ? " " No . I 'm all right . Do n't bring them in to meet me , will you ? Some other time . " He shook his head . " I did n't call Minify . Just this KatherineLacey . " " Is she nice ? " " Fine . " Never had he made a confidant of her and he could n't begin now . " There was some old gag about Michael Arlen , " he suddenly said . " Wait a minute . How 'd it go ? " She saw him screw up his eyes and remembered him at ten or twelve , laboring over homework . " Oh , I 've got it  --  train of thought is a wonderful gadget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says to him , Mr. Arlen , do tell me , is it true that you 're an Armenian ? You sound so British . ' " He was mimicking the accent of a British dowager . She laughed . " And Arlen answered , Would anyone say he was Armenian if he was n't Armenian ? ' " She laughed again and he with her . " We would , would n't we ? " " If there was a point to it , and there is. " 67The bell rang . Behind the closing door , she lay back , her book abandoned . If he could always be the way he is now , she thought . Direct , mobilized , all because he is fired with this idea . He does n't even stop to think of the difficult parts  --  there will be many , there would have to be . He could change in five minutes from man of thought to man of action . She had seen him do it when he decided to join the Marine Corps . He signed for OCS and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ignored , the hardships , the dangers . The inevitable problems of the interrupted career , the separation from Tommy , he had shoved off for future considering . He was that way now  --  on an island of rock after muddy floundering . Tom . IIe had n't even thought yet whether he 'd have to tell " l'orn about it or not , and that if he did , a child would surely find it impossible to follow or understand . It could start a confusion that might go pretty deep . She sighed . Phil would find the way to handle it , if it came , as he had always found the way for the boy 's problems . " It 's nice to have a mommy , is n't it , Daddy ? " Three years ago that was , possibly four , with the high voice of a little boy asking , and the solemn eyes looking up at Phil . " Tip and Sky have a mommy . " " Sure it is . It 's swell . " " 1 have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mommy ? " " She died when you were so little you could n't even walk or talk . Imagine not even knowing how to walk or talk . " " Yep . But anyway , you 've got me and Gram , and that 's a lot . " He had lifted Tom to his lap . " And someday I might marry again and you might have a second mother . Would you like that ? " The tone so ordinary , as if he were asking68whether he 'd like a new train , another picture book . From time to time the small conversation would happen again , taking a new form as Tom got older . Always Phil met it in that same key . Always he used it to enlist Tom 's support , long before the event , signing up an ally in plenty of time . If it were to happen , it would hold no shock of surprise for Tom . Voices came up from the stair well . Phil must have gone down to open the door himself . No words came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's voice and Phil 's . That was good to hear again . It would be good to see Phil married again before she died . " Oh , Phil , it 's so attractive . All those books . " " It 's not done yet . Those packages are pictures . " He was startled at how different having her in his house was from his being in hers . She was looking around , taking her coat off , avoiding a direct look at him . " I wish I had a fireplace that works . Mine 's only a fake one . " " I lit it just before you got here . " She sat in the chair close to the fire , and he busied himself with drinks . The moment he had opened the big door downstairs and had seen her waiting there , trying the knob to see if it would turn , physical awareness of her had swooped back into him . The impatience to tell her his idea for the series , to blurt it out and see her interest and approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding her beyond the glass-paned door , letting her pass in front of him to go upstairs . " What is it , Phil ? Tell me fast . The drinks 'll keep . " " I will in a minute . " He put the glass down , looked toward the rear of the house . " I 'll just check about " IIe motioned with his head and walked out of the room. 69 " I think I 've got the accommodator for you , " she called after him . She could hear his footsteps on bare flooring . Then his voice , " All fixed ? " and his mother 's answer , " Of course . I 'll call if I need anything . " He came back and this time he closed the living-room door behind him . Without moving her lips , she felt as if she were smiling . He had gone out just to be able to close the door without making a point of it . She waited for him to say something . She had thought about him a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she 'd done it . She 'd never told Jane about anybody else since Bill , at least not after just two evenings . Jane had said at once , " Married ? " and she 'd answered , " Oh , cut it . " But she 'd added , " 1le 's a widower with a child and a mother . " They 'd both made a face at the last word . Then she 'd changed the subject . Now she sat here in this delightful room , alone with him , yet knowing that his mother and his son were in the house too , so that there was none of the raffish air of visiting a man 's apartment . She took the drink Phil gave her . " You 're not telling it to me , " she said . " Funny . I thought I 'd spit it out the minute you got here . " You sounded awfully excited . " " I am . " There 'll be stumbling blocks and holes , and I just do n't give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . " " That 's the only way to do anything worth doing , I guess . " Suddenly from the side of her chair where he 'd been standing , he was bending down over her . She was wearing the same dress she 'd worn at the Minifys ' that first night . Her throat stretched long as she put her head back to look up . He kissed her hair and then her mouth . He was in the70wrong position ; it was a half kiss . He twisted her shoulder and kissed her lips as if he had just fought his way to her . She pushed back from him and stood up . For one second he looked at her . Then he took her into his arms . He heard her breath catch ; he felt the first resistancego slack . He kissed her , and this time she kissed him . " Kathy , this is something . It 's  --  for me , it 's " I know . " He kissed her again . Everything in the world was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask , question . Work , ideas , the future , nothing counted . " Phil , wait now . " He let his arms drop . He looked at her . Then he felt easy again . She was happy . Her eyes shone . Her breasts rose and fell as she breathed hard . She was n't going to warn him , preach at him , reveal some secret that meant there was nothing possible . " I have to just wait , " she said . " You go away and let me sit here a minute . " He crossed to the chair where he 'd set his own drink down . Again , an elation was in him , but not of triumph as the other had been , only of hope . He was shaken by it , tender with it . He wanted to thank her , for he knew not what . He wanted to talk to her , to kiss her again , to tell her of Betty and not of Betty 's death alone . He just sat , and coursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hoping . CHAPTER FIVEMINIFY LOOKED UP , ready to be pleased . On his desk twoMINIFY packages , stiff with glassy red bows , caught the morning sunlight . A dozen letters , their engraved tops concealed by the addressed envelopes slipped over their edges , lay before him . He shoved them back . On the side of the desk the advance issue of Smith 's , stamped MAKE- READY , caught his eye . He shoved that aside , too . " Must he good , " he said . " You sounded top of the world on the phone . " " Yeah . " Phil 's voice was quiet . Minify was no man to " sell " an idea to ; you just told him about it . " Remember I said I 'd fall on my face before I 'd put Professor Lieberman or anybody else through a quiz about this ? " Ile saw Minify noel . " I guess this goes back to that reluctance . And that sense that I 'd have to go at it from inside . " M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anyway , I got  --  hell , let me just give you the title for the series . " Ile waited while Minify clicked up a switch to the interoffice communicator and said , " No calls , Mary . " When the switch went down again , Phil said , without em- phasis , " I was Jewish for three months . " Minify was reaching for a cigarette . His hand stopped on the way to the package . " Christ , Phil . " I Ic hitched himself forward in his chair . " Or six weeks or however long , till I get the feel of it . " He saw Minify 's lips repeating the title , testing it ; saw his eyes go to the cover of the make-ready , visualizing it there . " It 's a hell of a stunt , Phil . " 72 " Usually these I ' titles give me a pain . But there 's such a wallop to this one . " Minify nodded . " It wo n't be just the same , " Phil added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minify nodded . He looked at Phil thoughtfully . " I knew you 'd get the series going somehow , in spite of the sticky start . I did n't think  --  but who 'd ever think of this ? Can you get away with it ? " " If you and Mrs. Minify and Kathy wo n't give me away . I have n't told Kathy yet , but I bet Minify took over . For unbroken stretches he explored the possibilities , a fever of planning in him . Then he fell silent , to listen to Phil . For half an hour they mapped out a campaignto follow , always allowing for the improvising Phil would have to do as he went along . Clubs , resorts , apartmentleases , social life . Interviews for jobs , applications to medical schools . Perhaps some trips to " trouble spots " that came into the news . Getting to know people of all types in New York . " That 'll be the toughest part for me , " Phil remarked . " I 'm not gregarious by nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them were skimmed clean of their top ideas , Phil stretched . He felt good . " There wo n't be one bloody thing that 'll be news about clubs and jobs and hotels , " he said . " I might chuck all that stuff except for the subjective reactions . " " Any way you want . When do you start ? " " What 's the matter with now ? I told you I wanted to work in the office for a while  --  I 'll get it going right here . " Minify reached toward the buzzer but drew back without touching it . " Remember you said nobody 'd read the goddam things ? " " They 'll read this . " " Damn right they will . " They grinned at each other , and Phil said , " Well , I 'll reportprogress once in a while . " 73Minify said , " Any time , " and tapped the buzzer . Mary Cresson , his middle-aged secretary who had followed him from job to job , came in , her book and pencil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work inside a couple of weeks . Maybe more . Get Jordan to fix him up , will you ? " " Mr. Kingland 's office is empty . " " Fine . " " I 'll go along with you , " Phil said . But outside the door , he heard , " Hey , Phil , " and went back again . John had pulled back the sheaf of letters and had his pen ready for signing them . " Dig up a working title , will you ? " he said . " For the file we keep on Futures . " " Right . " " We wo n't tell the real one to anybody at all ; it 'd give your show away around here . " " What about just scheduling it as Antisemitism in the U. S. ' ? " John jotted it down . " And what about help ? Secretary for all the letters and phone calls on it ? " " I had n't thought . I 've never had help . " " M ight as well have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have to know too , would n't she ? " " Why ? " They each thought about it . " Ca n't see why even she should know a damn thing about it . Suppose I were really Jewish and you 'd given me this assignment ? What difference would it make to her or anybody ? " " Sure . You 're right . " Again he tapped the buzzer . " Mary , check secretarial , would you , and assign a smart girl to Mr. Green for as much time as he 'll need ? " " Yes , Mr. Minify . " " No hurry about it , " Phil said . " I always make a lot of notes first . " But when he went to the office that was to be his , he made74no effort to get started on his notes . It was a pleasant , twowindowedroom , facing south . The austere shaft of the RCA Building in Rockefeller Center was right in front of him , a little to the left . Against the gray of the winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stayed at the window , looking at it , and then sat down at his desk . From beyond the partition came guffaws of sudden laughter . " Somebody 's told a dirty story , " he decided , and smiled , too . Next door was the art department , Miss Cresson had told him . That meant loud discussions , many visitors , arguments . He knew . But when he was working well , noise never bothered him . He tried the typewriter . He called an office boy and sent for stationery , pencils , ink , clips , a jar of rubber cement , and a pair of long shears . " I 'm one of those guys that paste in added paragraphs or rewrites , " he explained to the surprised face . " Scotch tape 'll do if there 's no cement . " But after the supplies had come , he still made no motion to begin work . Lazily he gave himself over to remembering last night . For two hours more he and Kathy had talked of themselves , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginnings . No matter how direct and free you wished to make every sentence , and they had each wished it , there were all the blocks that kept standing up , barricades to full revelation . Once , at the fireplace with his back half turned to her , he 'd managed to get out one of the things that pressed hardest to be said . " I 'm one of those solemn guys , I guess . You know  --  alwaysfine to get in the hay , but a wife 's what I 'm really hoping for sometime . " And from behind him , uncertain , troubled , she 'd answered , " Anybody does . A wife , or a husband . If it turns out that way . " 75He 'd never heard that note in her voice . She 'd always seemed so unruffled and sure , the way she had when she 'd hit the wrong keys at the piano . But last night , after she 'd said that , he 'd wondered whether there were n't sad dark places that she stumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Any woman would rather be married , " she 'd gone on , " but if it 's been a mistake once , you 're afraid . " He 'd taken her into his arms then , just holding her . She said nothing , nor did he . Yet each of them  --  he had felt it  --  each , in a secret and separate cave of emotion , was consideringthe words , married , vile , husband . 1 le had kissed her again , and suddenly , this time , something was promised between them . I lc had become sure , violently sure , that the moment  --  Would come when they 'd be in bed together . Not yet . Not for a while . But sometime . Remembering now , he shoved his chair back from the desk and went back to the window . It had just begun to snow . " There was no wind , and these first flakes floated on the tranquil air . Delight stirred in him , memory of the glee he 'd al%v.rys felt with the first snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait was at last rewarded  --  the sled ready on the back porch could at last be used . There was always a kind of victory to it . One had always waited so long . " I 've waited so long . " Ile was seeing her again tonight . He never had got around to telling her what he was going to do . Two or three times she 'd tried to bring him back to the series , but he could n't make the transition to the impersonal world of ideas . That first talking to each other on the level of feeling and not of biography was too engrossing . That first realizingthat she wanted him to kiss her , as he wanted her , was too heady . He 'd been afraid to shift their mood . " This is n't the time to talk about work , " he 'd said . " I 'll save it for tomorrow . " The office door opened . Mary Cresson put her head in . " Mr. Minify wondered if you 'd like to have luncheon with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sure . " He glanced at his watch . " Who 's Bert McAnny ? " Tingler was fiction editor , he knew from the masthead . " Assistant to Bill Jayson , the art editor . He 'd only been here a while before he got drafted , but they gave him his old job back , anyway . About one , then . " This would be the start . This would be the chance to get it across  --  how , he did n't know . You did n't blurt it out ; it had to come up . If it did n't come up , you made it come up . There 'd be something that would lead into it . His heart began to pound as if he were going into an unaccustomed place where there was sure to be danger . But his mind felt ready and impatient . Anne Dettrey was at their table , too . She was woman 's editor , though there were no recipe and fashion departments in the magazine . Her province was nonfiction of special interest to women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember how he knew , that she was one of the top editors on the staff . As John had come by with the two men , he 'd said , " I 've asked Anne Dettrey to come along , Phil , " and there 'd been a blur of how-do-you-do 's all round , as Minify did introductions . " Phil ? " she 'd said . " I thought it was Schuyler Green . " " That 's my writing name . " Through the shoptalk of the first part of the meal , he 'd thought , That 's the way you do it . Lie when you have to , but for the most part , it 'll be as much what you leave out as what you put in . There was no lie in leaving out the explanationabout " Schuyler . " Just let them assume he 'd made up a pseudonym cold . She was a woman about his own age , this Anne Dettrey . She talked well , turning the kind of phrases you found in slick fiction and never heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural always . She had a rather long , clearly boned face , and she was almost as tall as he was . Her reddish hair and brown eyes compelled the attention , though you 'd never call her pretty . Because they 'd all plunged , even as they were walking over to the restaurant , into some ques- tion about the issue going to press next week , he 'd had time to orient himself to all of them . The short , pale man was Tingler . He was middle-aged and ugly , with thick-lensed glasses over protruding eyes that probably meant hyperthyroid . His voice was calm always , almost bored , even when the others were pitched up on some question or other . He was a competent one , clearly . McAnny was a youngster , not out of his twenties . Phil saw the discharge button in his lapel . He 'd never worn his own , or the ribbon . But Bert McAnny , with his small features and light voice , would wear his for a long time . There was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . He was flushing now as he asked the editor about " the time you de- cided to change Smith 's into a liberal magazine . " " It was n't that way at all , Bert . I did n't . " Minify smiled , but above his genial mouth the gray eyes were thoughtful . " Fact is , ww hen they offered me this job as editor in chief , I said if they were out to run a liberal magazine , quote , quote , I was n't their man . " " You ? " The sharp inflection from Phil and McAnny pleased Minify . Anne and Frank Tingler showed no surprise . They 'd been on the staff since John had taken over . Phil had read about how he 'd gone to . Smith 's . Way back , he 'd been one of the best reporters on the old World , in the days when a by-line was a badge and not just an automatic gadget. 78 After the World had folded , he 'd knocked about on other papers without finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad , free-lanced foreign stuff for magazines , and returned , surprisingly enough , to become managing editor of one of the folksier women 's magazines . But he 'd increasedits circulation from the first year . When Smith 's , along with three other magazines , had changed ownership in 1940 , Minify had become editor in chief . In a year , Smith 's circulation jumped thirty per cent ; in another , thirty more . The three other magazines had been abandoned , their paper allotments going into this one weekly . By now its circulationwas more than double what it had been when he 'd taken the reins . " Sure , I did , " Minify went on . " You do n't get anywhere with that for a platform . " " How do you mean ? " McAnny asked . " Ever hear of anybody calling a bunch of guys together and saying , Let 's run a reactionary magazine ' ? " He laughed . " It 's never like that  --  they get together to run a successful magazine . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Same thing the other way around . " " I never thought of it that way , " McAnny said . " I took this job with one idea  --  to make a go of it . It 's been a go because the readers like our stories and serials and pictures and articles . It 's true I do n't hire reactionary guys  --  I 'd just fight with them all the time if I did . So with the staff we 've got , we generally manage to be on the liberal side . But that 's all the trick there is to it  --  not a conscious line you take . " " What about your decision to run a series like the one I 'm starting ? " Phil said . He did it deliberately . He could n't let this whole luncheon go by without managing to take his first step. 79 " What 're you doing , Mr. Green ? " That was Anne Dettrey , but the others had turned to him also . " Good case in point , " Minify answered for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on antisemitism . I did n't assign it because  it 's the liberal thing ' to do . I just think it 'll get read , start a stink , make talk . " Closer , Phil thought . When the opening did come , how would he say it ? How had he put it last night ? He could n't remember . In his mind he rehearsed phrases . " I 'm a Jew . " Would that be the natural way ? " I 'm Jewish . " That was better . " I 'm a Jew . I 'm Jewish . " " Got any special slant on it yet ? " Tingler asked , turning to him . " Yeah . But I 'm never any good talking about a thing till it 's written . " Tension stood in his words , in spite of his desireto seem matter-of-fact . " You sound as if you had something pretty hot , " Anne said . " I feel pretty hot over it , " he said . He glanced at her . I ! ere it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has anything to do with my being Jewish . " ) f ( nurse it has n't , " she said . " When 'll they run ? " " Oh , Phil 's just started , " Minify put in . " Probably not before sununer . " IIc sounded comfortable . " I 'm afraid it 'll be just as timely then . " They all made sounds or gestures of agreement , and the talk went off again to the troublesome next issue . Phil heard none of it . " It 's done ; I 'm in , " he told himself . The odd excitement in him when the moment came had been read as high interest in the series itself ; that it had to do with anything more personal than that had been apparent to nobody . Of that he was sure . Of course , this was a special crowd ; he 'd had no hostility to contend with . Nobody had shown surprise ; nobody had changed expression ; they didn't8ogive a damn . But it was the first hurdle , anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and he was launched . Like a debutante , he thought , and smiled to himself . He was n't due for another half-hour , but Kathy was dressed and ready . She went to the piano , played a few measures , and then stood up . From the small kitchen where Claudia was getting dinner came the teasing smell of roastingbeef . He did n't know yet that they would have dinner there . He would be pleased . The room was too warm . She crossed to the window and threw it wide open . At once snow began to sift over the sill . It had been snowing all day , and the radio said there 'd be twelve inches before morning . It felt right to have it snow a week before Christmas . Everything felt right these days . Last night she 'd come home from Phil 's and gone straight to bed . She 'd propped both pillows behind her as if she were going to read , but she 'd never opened a book . She 'd lain there , smoking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . If ever there was a time , she 'd thought lazily , almost cozily , when you 're glad you 're a woman , it 's this first moment of knowing that a man you 're drawn to is falling in love with you . That 's when you 're completely , uncomplicatedlyglad you are . None of the vague resentment that " it 's a man 's world " held its shape against the good solventof that first knowing . Suddenly it was an unarguable blessed thing to be a woman , and you felt a kind of indebtednessto the man who made you feel so . All day she 'd felt that , and now , waiting for him to get there , she still did . He 'd talked of marriage , obliquely , squeezing the words out . She wanted to marry again . She 'd never be fully happy without it . Perhaps " being conventional " had something to do with it . Once Uncle John had teased her because she 'd said she 'd 8inever go to a theater alone at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smoke during intermission made her squirm . " Give up smoking , " he 'd said , and then , " Vassar and Bill between them did n't have any luck making you conservative , Kathy ; they did better about making you conventional . " " Because I wo n't behave just like a man ? " She 'd felt resentful . " A man can drop into a bar alone and have a drink and get talking to somebody and go have dinner with him  --  you think I 'm conventional because I ca n't ? " " Do n't get so emphatic . I did n't mean much . " But he 'd been partly right . She just did n't feel right on her own , and maybe that was being conventional about " the things a woman ca n't do . " It was trivial , probably a throwbackto the nagging envy in childhood about being a boy instead of " just a girl . " Trivial or no , it was there . She wound her watch . It was seven . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be doing it , and if that made her a conventional fool , why , let it . The bell rang. 1 lc was taking off galoshes in the outside hall , and she waited till lie straightened up . When he came in , she put her hand out , and lie took it in both of his and then released it quickly . " You 're on the dot again , " she said . " Should I he fashionably late ? " He laughed as he shook snow oft his coat . " The other time you said that and I said that and then I was afraid you 'd think I was coy or always mugging or soniething . " his voice was easier than she 'd ever heard it , his manner surer . She watched him fold his coat and put it on a chair , his hat on top of it . He sniffed at the homely smell of cooking and looked about him . She saw him catch sight of the table , laid and waiting in one corner of the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't mean here ? " When she nodded , he made a sound of surprise and pleasure . " So we can talk . " She was delighted she 'd thought of it . She motioned him to the sofa and went to the bar table . " This time I 'm not going to let you get going on anything else . I 've tried all day to guess what it could be . " " Have you really ? " " I kept thinking , suppose I were him , and had to find an idea for this , what would I do ? " She came back with two Martinis , walking gingerly because she 'd poured them too full . He waited , unwilling to say anything . He wanted her to go on , to offer even more testimony that his problems matteredto her . He took the glass and leaned forward to sip it before he brought it closer . She sat on the sofa beside him , in her eyes an eagerness that was all the testimony anybody could want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her nose and shook her head . " I 'm just no good at ideas . The ones you told me seemed swell , but you threw them out and kept on hunting . " " You 'll see why now . " He hitched himself around . He wanted to see her face change as Minify 's had . For another moment he said nothing . " I 'm going to tell everybody I 'm Jewish , that 's all . " " Jewish ? But you 're not , Phil , are you ? " Instantly she added , " It would n't make any difference , of course . " But something had appeared in her eyes . " You said , I 'm going to tell '  --  as if you had n't before but would now , " she went on , " so I just wondered . Not that it 'd matter to me , one way or the other . " " You said that before . " He put his drink down . " Well , are you , Phil ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but it choked back . 83Some veil of a thing had shown in her eyes . He 'd been watching her face every minute , greedy for the quick approvalthat would show there . This had been quick , but different . She wanted him not to be Jewish . She knew he was not , knew that if he were , he 'd never have concealed it . But she wanted to hear him say so right out . " Oh , this is nonsense , " she said briskly . " I know perfectly well you 're not Jewish and I would n't care if you were . It 's just interesting . " He reached for a cigarette . Of course she would n't care , any more than he would . Or would she ? If he said now , " I really am Jewish " ? I Ie 'd be the same guy , the same face , the same voice , manner , tweed suit , same eyes , nose , body , but the word " Jewish " would have been said and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very same vessel that containedhim there 'd be a something to " not-care " about . " Why , Phil , " she said slowly , " you 're annoyed . " She put her drink down also . " You have n't said anything . " " I 'm not annoyed . I 'm just thinking . " " Do n't be so serious about it  --  you must know where I stand . " " I du , Kathy . " " It 's just that it caught me off balance . You know , not knowing much about you because you kept making me talk about niv childhood . So for a second there " She laughed and shook her head . " Not very bright on the uptake . " he smiled . I lc felt heavy , flattened out . With her last sentence , the creamy smooth tone had come back . The laugh was the laugh he 'd heard that first night . His hand , listless on the arm of the sofa , dropped over the side . Without knowing that he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out of sight , making a circle . " But anyway , you do n't like my angle , " he said . " Do you ? " 84 " Oh , I do . It 's She broke off . Now she reached fora cigarette , and he leaned toward her to light it . Her hair shone . He heard her breathe . Physical knowledge of her moved through him . But there was a sadness to it he could n't name . " It 's what ? " " Oh , Phil , I just think it 'll mix everybody up . People wo n't know what you are . " " After I 'm through , they 'll " He could n't say it . Aremarkable thing had happened . Something had seized him that he could n't argue with . It had started to happen with her first question . Now he knew suddenly what it was . This heavy strange thing in him was what you felt when you 'd been insulted . He felt insulted . If he were really a Jew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first lesson . With Kathy , he 'd stumbled into his first lesson at feeling bruised and unwilling to say the placating thing , the reassuring thing . She had reminded him that there was something importantabout knowing that you were not a Jew or were a Jew , no matter what your face or voice or manners or whole being . A slow soreness had been spreading through him . He 'd be damned if he 'd let her see it . But at last he knew what it was . " They 'll know afterwards that you 'd just been assuming a pose ? " she finished for him . " Of course they will . And even so , it 'll keep cropping up . " " All right . Let it . " His words were calm . No , they were calmly spoken , but the answer was brusque . That much he could not help . Kathy ? The Kathy who 'd thought up the whole series ? She wanted to fight the thing , sure . She wanted Smith 's to use its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight . That 's the way she 'd put it that night . But she85did n't like the idea of anybody misunderstanding anything about him . He saw a perplexity begin in her face . She was frowning . She was thinking , away somewhere from where they were , thinking to herself . Then the moment was over . She made a quick scissoring with both her hands , slashing the last few minutes out of time . " I 'm out of my head , " she said firmly . " Let it ' is right . Who cares ? I was just being too practical about things . " She smiled directly at him . " It 's a grand idea . Only , last night you said there 'd be pitfalls , and I guess I got looking for those right off . " His spirits rose . This quick change bewildered him , but he felt relieved , at least enough to get by on for now . The mind plays funny tricks  --  look at his own " slow take " on Belle 's Jew-us-down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Those nasty propaganda phrases . " Again he was reassured . He had been a fool to toss his scheme at her without any windup . You could do things like that with an editor , but with her he 'd have done better to explain first , lead her along to make her see the inevitability of it . " There 'll be nasty things , " he said . " But after all , the whole point is to find out for myself . " " I 1o4 long will it take , do you think ? " He shrugged , and her shoulders imitated his , as if to agree that nobody could ever predict how long anything important would take . " You and the Nlinifys will have to promise not to give away my act , " fie said . She nodded , and he said , " But really . No exceptions for anything . O.K. ? " " O.K. " She made a child 's cross-my-heart . " What about the people at Smith 's ? Wo n't they talk ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Only John . " " They think you 're Jewish ? " She sounded unbelieving. 86 " I do n't think you understand , Kathy . If this is going to work  --  maybe it wo n't  --  but the only chance is to go whole hog at it . " Carefully he explained about having met none of the staff until today , knowing nobody in the East ; he gave a brief account of the luncheon and the start he 'd made . " It 's got to run right through everything , " he ended . " Why , of course . I had n't really seen it before . " She seemed penitent , and guilt rose obscurely in him . He demanded too much always . He judged too quickly . " I got riled at you before , " he said . " I thought for a minute that if I were Jewish " At her quick laugh he broke off . He felt a fool . " Now , Phil , you 're not calling me An Anti Semite ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no . " There was a pause . They each leaned forward to pick up their neglected glasses . The silence expanded . It 's no good analyzing every reaction , he thought . Was his feeling a fool the right reaction ? Or his being riled ? Save it , quit it , he ordered himself . Dope it later , when you can think . " My trouble is , " he said to her , " I 'm always too damn apt to weigh and measure and wonder and ponder everythingtill I do n't know where I stand . " " I 'm not , " she said . Her voice was soft . " Not often . But last night I did that , too . I did n't get to sleep till nearly three . " " Kathy . " He wanted to take her into his arms . We 'll work things out , he thought . If there 's anything real to work out , we 'll work it out . Somewhere behind him a swinging door swished . " Dinner , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . " The soreness of disappointment would n't leave her . The 87moment the front door had closed on him , she 'd wanted to call him back , find the one more thing to say that would change the feel of the evening . It was n't even eleven . She went about the living room , emptying ash trays , tidying up the bar table . Claudia had missed his dinner napkin ; it was still on the end table where he 'd carried it with him when they 'd gone over to the sofa for coffee . She took up the yellow square . " KLP , " the monogram said fatly . She tossed it on the coffee tray and carried both into the small kitchen . Claudia was always in such a rush to escape , it had become an unwritten agreement between them that she need not bother with the belated coffee things . Kathy washed the small cups and the slivers of spoons . " KLP " twined on their fiddle-shaped handles . All fancy and twisted , she thought . She dried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The evening had balled up . She 'd balled it up by that extraordinary reluctance she 'd felt about his idea . Rememberingthat first instant after his announcement , she felt fidgety . Vhat had happened to her ? She did n't like it . " It 's a brilliant notion , Phil . It 'll make a stunning series . You 'll be famous . " Twice she 'd said that , once during dinner and once later on . He 'd smiled each time , and each time she 'd thought that the snarl was straightening out . But the next moment he 'd talked about something else , and the discomfort remained in her . What had hit her ? From where had it come ? She sighed . The subterranean paths that twined through human impulses and motives always eluded you if you tried to follow them . At least for her they did . There was no use to will herself to the task . She never had a road map . She always got lost . It really was a good idea ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a play had a good plot , or a novel a 88strong sense of character and movement . She should have said so at once , kept to herself the instant visions of the difficulties he 'd get into , praised him wholly . That 's what a man needed from a woman . Belief , encouragement , never skepticism , no matter how truly skepticism might be justified . She 'd failed him by reacting too quickly . That 's all it was . Bill would n't have minded ; he would n't even have noticed anything that subtle . Phil was neurotic , she supposed , easily thrown off key , easily let down . But the Bills were n't for her , and Phil was . She needed to learn him a little more to know where lay the craters and bogs of his intricate personality and be quicker about stepping around them . It was so easy to hurt a man like Phil . Yet the sensitive mind was his appeal , and the delight she felt when his eyes went easy and happy was her reward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The accommodatorshe 'd sent him , Emma , was the timetable kind who would march off at eleven , heart patient or no , so he had no choice . But perhaps another hour would have sloughed off their heaviness . He had n't even tried to kiss her the whole stilted evening . And the quiet look had been on him . Disconsolate , she turned out the lights and went into her room . As she undressed , dissatisfaction wormed anew through her . " I 'm getting neurotic myself . " She 'd blundered with him over his idea , so what ? She 'd said the wrong things , so what ? He knew a moment later she was sorry  --  she 'd said perfectly openly she 'd been off her head . You blunder , you apologize  --  that ought to be all there was to it . Instead that good feeling that everything was right had burst like a bubble blown against slate. 89CHAPTER SIX  --  " ( A TE ARE BORN IN INNOCENCE . " The phrase was in him , a cluster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge in his blood . A hundred times in the next days it spoke to him . Where it had come from , what it was trying to tell him , he did not know . It was just there , one measure of a stately music . " We are born in innocence . " Like a phrase written in sleep , laden with an import the dreaming mind strains to hold past the moment of waking , it touched the threshold of his understanding again and again , only to retreat before he could welcome the message he felt it brought . It had the commanding significance of the final spinning sentence he had pursued just before surrender to the anesthetic in the base hospital . And , as then , he felt enormous with its revelation , comforted that he had found for himself some magic litany that explained essence and truth and being . But though he could this time remember the words , as words , he could not grasp or pin down the implication that hung mistily over them . At Kathy 's that night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her across the table , while lie half listened to something she was saying about Central l'ark under the first good snow . And since then they had sounded their grave cadence through all his changing moods . Alone now , on Christmas afternoon , he felt them as much in the room with him as the lights on the tree and the blurred voices from the kitchen. 90We are born in innocence . In blood and water and pain we are born , but in an unstained purity of heart . Wizened , crushed , our fogged eyes blinded by new light , our outraged skins shocked by a thirty-degree drop in the envelope about us  --  still we are born a good vessel , innocent of corruption . Corruption comes later . The first fear is a corruption , the first reaching for something that defies us . The first nuance of difference , the first need to feel better than the different one , more loved , stronger , richer , more blessed  --  these are corruptions . One by one they pour their drops into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future life . His mother came in , moving slowly as if to test out the returned ease of her body . In her eyes there still was the look of contentment with which she 'd watched Tom 's bright delight of the Christmas morning . She said , " You 're not staying in because of me , Phil ? " " I have n't a date . I know you 're all right . Craigie 'll be surprised tomorrow . " She nodded , belligerently , as if she 'd indeed show Dr. Craigie and his spying electrocardiograph their proper places . The bell rang , and she moved to the buzzer . Phil went out into the hall . " Telegram , " he said a moment later . " Funny . The girls " He signed , tore it open . " Dave . " He read the brief message . " Got my letter , and he 's to start any minute and would like a stopover . Boy , that 'll be good , to see Dave . " She was as pleased as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and decided against it . " Dave can have mine , and I 'll sleep on the sofa , " Phil said . " That way , if we stay up all night chewing the fat , the kid wo n't be in the way . " The spell was broken . When she left the room , he went91back to the five words . But now they were just words , with no promise of secret meaning . " Probably had something to do with Christmas coming and the new snow in the park and the new thing I was starting , like getting born again . " But why the melancholy that went with them ? " Dad , say , Dad . Please . " Tom 's shout came as imperious as though the house were on fire . Phil did n't move . " What 's up ? " " It wo n't work . I 've got the caps in it , and it just wo n't . Oh , the damn thing 's haywire . " " Let 's have a look at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a fine business , traceable to his own liberal use of them . Maybe he was overcasual about the way he ignored them in the kid . He looked up . Tom was standing rigid , just inside the door . From his dejected right hand , the cap pistol dangled . That morning when he 'd seen it , he 'd gone into a delirium over it . " Iron , Dad , " he 'd shouted . " Not wooden . Feel it ; it 's cold . " Now he stood waiting for Phil to say something . " What am I ? " he demanded . For the moment the crisis of the gun was forgotten . Phil looked at him . Across the bridge of his nose , he wore a green scarf , folded into a triangle . Low on his skinny hips hung a studded belt and holster . His corduroy " longics " which the eights and nines wore these days were tucked into his still-new galoshes . Besides the pistol , he had a pearl-handled revolver in the holster and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him judiciously . " You 're a  --  let 's see . A sheriff . " " Oh , Dad . " ( Disgust . ) " A horse rustler . " " No . " " A cowboy in Arizona . " " Dad , you 're nuts . " " Well , then . " Enough of this game . There never had been the slightest doubt what he was , but the rules of childhoodmade an immediate guess unthinkable . " Then you 're an outlaw , a bandit outlaw . " " Yes , that 's it , yessir that 's just it . " Above the green fold of silk , his eyes gleamed . Slyly he went behind the wing chair , in a movement which brought only the word " skulking " to Phil 's mind , and aimed the cap pistol at his father . Then , suddenly , he remembered , and tragedy stood gaunt upon him . " It wo n't work . The caps stick . " Phil took the pistol and pried apart . the two halves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived last night , and nothing about the package showed that it was from her . This morning , when Tom had ripped off the bright wrappings , the card had fallen to the floor , ignored by the instantly inflamed child . Mrs. Green had picked it up , glanced at it , and handed it to Phil . " What a nice thing , " she 'd said . " Merry Christmas from Katherine Lacey  --  just because I 've heard a lot about you . " He 'd read it with a crazy leap of pleasure . She did n't do it just to please me , he thought again as he worked on the gun . She wants him to like her , too . She need n't have sent any Christmas gift at all to a child she does n't know , but she did . She went into those shoving crowds in the stores and searched and rejected and kept on and finally found this . She took it home and fussed with the big bow herself and dropped it off here herself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Trying to see . " The creaky , balky misunderstanding which had stood between them before dinner that night had been nothing another man would have noticed . All through dinner he hadbelabored himself to forget it . When she 'd come back to the plan later on , she 'd been enthusiastic over it , happy with it . Twice she had praised it , and twice he had felt only that this was afterthought . He had had the wit to say nothing further of the small doubt which stubbornly nibbled at him . He had excoriated his need for approval as " an infantilism " and ended by feeling clumsy about everything he did . And when he 'd had to leave he had gone reluctantly , as one does when things still need fixing up . But the next day at the office , he 'd regained all his confidence . About himself , about Kathy , about the series . The girl who 'd been assigned to him , Miss Wales , was intelligent , quick , interested . She was going to be a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clone by mail and telephone . All day he 'd felt integrated and composed . And at four he 'd telephoned . " " I here , Dad , the little hammer 's caught . See ? Right there ! " " Getting it now , Tom . Wait a minute . " He recoiled the spool of caps and inserted it again into the nest cast in the metal . I Ie closed the sliding part and dramatically cocked the pistol . It fired . " Oh , gee , thanks . " Tom grabbed it and was gone . Exit , shooting , thought Phil . As if she had been sitting right beside him , politely waiting for him to finish the repair job , he turned back to Kathy . From his first " hello " on the phone , she 'd begun to talk with an earnestness that caressed his fretted spirits . " It was a kind of aberration last night , Phil . I thought about it a lot , after , and did n't like myself much . " He 'd blamed himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the while they talked , he admired this ability to say she 'd been wrong . " They 'd seen each other once more before she 'd left for the Christmas week end with her sister94Jane . The sweetness of reconciliation had been theirs , though there 'd been no real quarrel , and he 'd had to fight back the words that kept bursting against his orders to them to stay unsaid a while longer . In his chair , Phil shifted uneasily . He stood up , crossed the room to the tree , disconnected the cord from the wall socket . The tree dimmed as if expression had fled a face . Ornamented , arrayed , it had made the infinitesimal shift from life to death . He had thought as much of Betty as on other Christmases , had been as subject to all the willful tricks associationcould play . Specialized tricks at times like Christmas , seasonal tricks , with the help of brightly colored glass balls and flame-shaped bulbs , come forth from forgotten boxes , to set memory going with freshened sharpness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the Decembers had been echoes of it , each more muted than the last , yet each clamoring in its own way as distance had added the ingredient of lost hope . But this time there was an insulation along his nerves , a buffer to soften the old blows . And even as he thought , the muscles in his throat knotted , the slow thud of grief took up its interrupted rhythm . Like a devout , stepped briefly into a chapel , he stood again for a moment in the old sorrow . Dr. Craigie was enthusiastic . " No immediacy . " He kept returning to the phrase , and it had its effect on Mrs. Green and Phil . There was enormous calm in his manner , a pleasureat the massed notes and graphs spread on the desk before him . It had been a long visit , an exhaustive inquiry . Waiting now for his mother to come from the dressing room , Phil felt relief mixed with a hurry to leave . " A good internist , though , " Dr. Craigie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish . Or have you some good man you like ? " " I 've been asking at the office , " Phil said . " One of the editors there recommended Dr. Abrahams so highly , I made an appointment for Monday . " " Abrahams ? " " J. E. , I think she said . Ephraim . Mt . Sinai or Beth Israel or both . " " Yes , yes , of course . You wo n't need this then . " ' With finality he placed a prescription blank on the desk before him . Phil picked it up . Two names and addresses were written there . Mason Van Dick . James Ayres Kent . " If you , that is , if you should decide to have your mother see either The tone was extremely polite . Too polite , raising an issue . " Why ? Is n't this Abrahams any good ? " " No , nothing like that . Good man . Completely reliable . Not given to overcharging and running visits out , the way some do . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You mean the way some doctors ' do ? " ( Do you tell even a doctor that you 're Jewish ? Was it necessary to produce that fact everywhere ? Was it not an affront to a man to offer him the unsolicited fact , when its very uttering carried the implication that it held an importance to him , the listener ? ) " Or did you mean , " he went on , " the way some Jewish doctors ' do ? " Craigie laughed . " I suppose you 're right , " he said heartily . " I suppose some of us do it , too . " Then Phil had not given it the wrong reading . Us , Them ; We , They . " If Dr. Abrahams does n't impress me , " he said , " I 'll try Van Dick or Kent . I 've no special loyalty to Jewish doctors simply because I 'm Jewish myself . " Stephen Craigic swallowed . Ile laughed again . He folded96the electrocardiogram and placed it in the Manila envelope on the desk before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Good man is a good man . I do n't believe in prejudice . And do remember me to John Minify . Have n't seen him in years , since the night his father had a coronary . Fine man , that . " Mrs. Green appeared , and they left . That 's all it was , Phil thought later , stretching back from the littered desk in the office . A flick here , a flick there . Craigie had n't known he " was Jewish . " If he had , he 'd have been " more careful . " But already in this first week , after he , Phil , had made it a known premise wherever he reasonably could , the same flick had come often enough . Sometimes it came only from an unconscious train of thought , as with Bill Johnson , of the Times , the other day . Returning the borrowed clips himself , he 'd worked it in easily , without strain ; it had been forgotten before they 'd started down the street together for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd fallen into talk of the atomic secret , the Pearl Harbor investigation , politics in general . " You were for Roosevelt ? " Johnson began , and then added , " Sure , you would be . " " Why would I be ? " Johnson had n't answered . Phil had let it pass . Flick . Half a dozen other times , the same thing had happened . That 's all these first days had given him . No big things . No yellow armband , no marked park bench , no Gestapo . Just here a flick and there another . Each unimportant . Each to be rejected as unimportant . But day by day the little thump of insult . Day by clay the tapping on the nerves , the delicate assault on the proud stuff of a man 's identity . That 's how they did it . A week had shown him how they did it . At Phil 's elbow the telephone rang . His mind wiped clear97of every thought . All day yesterday he 'd hoped she 'd call . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you here again ? " " No , home . " Her voice was brisk . " Mamma 's letter just came . About your wonderful scheme . " There was a clacking and whining in the receiver , and he lost her next words . "  --  and I have no control over what you do , but I want you to know I 'm not having any part of it . " " Keep your shirt on . Nobody 's asking you to do a thing . " " You know what Dick 's company is like . And no matter how I disapprove of them , I just have to be realistic about it . I ca n't have people thinking " For God 's sake , Belle . " " All right , be high and mighty . Just the same , if people are going to think Dick 's wife is Jewish ! " I le scarcely listened to the swift words , foaming with self-justification . " All children are so decent to start with . " I lis mother 's words sounded louder in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you fell for it at school or anywhere . " But one was n't fixed forever in childhood patterns , in spite of what the Catholics believed about the first seven years . Those early patterns could be shifted ; new values could be superimposed . " Stop wetting your pants , " he said roughly . " I 'm not going to drag you into it . Nobody thought you were a miner or an ( ) kit. , did they ? " When it was over , he sat glaring at the telephone as if it were Belle herself . There was a knock at the door , and he called out , " Yes ? " glad to be distracted from his exasperation . Miss Wales came in , a dozen letters in her hand . " Some answers , " she said , and put them on his desk . The envelopes were already slit , and he smiled at her . From the first day she had treated him as if she 'd been his secretary for years . She offered him co-operation , friendliness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he supposedit was a little " bold . " Her blond hair was an elaborationof curls , her skin pale against the ripe mouth . High cheekbones made her seem Scandinavian , Slavic , something foreign and interesting . She had the curious New York speech that he was not yet used to , plus some extra oddities that intrigued his ear . ' When she said " bottle " or " settle , " she left the double is out completely , a little the way a Scot did . He had tried , with amusement once when he was alone , to mimic her pronunciation . " Bah-ull . " " Seh-ull . " No , he could n't quite do it . He began on the letters . Just what he 'd expected . Nothing new . These were the cliches of the thing , really . Yet as he read on , anger simmered low in him . " Yes to the Greens and no to the Greenbergs ? " Miss Wales asked good-humoredly . " At least promises to let the Greens know if any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he read them . This was from the first batch of inquiries to resort hotels in Miami , Palm Beach , Bermuda . They 'd gone off in pairs , on blank stationery , and on the same day . Each was signed , " Philip Green , " but one of each pair included the phrase , " for myself and my cousin , Capt . Joseph Greenberg , " while the other made no mention of this cousin . The ones without bore Phil 's own address ; the ones with had Minify 's address on Park Avenue . He and John had planned this move together , to avoid confusion about the replies . Even the " care of Minify " was unnecessary  --  " Apt. 18 A " with the street and house number would do it . Jessie Minify , who looked on the whole thing , John had wryly reported , as an exciting kind of secret-service game to which she was eager to lend a hand , had taken on the task of readdressing these letters to the office or seeing them safely into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " John had remarked . " She adores your idea . Of course she wo n't give you away . She 's dying to give a big party and ask all the antisemites she can think of and introduce you  --  she did n't say any of this , you know , Phil , but I rather think I 'm right  --  as this nice Jewish man , Phil Green , did you hear , Jewish . ' " Phil had laughed . " Anyway , I know she thinks of antisemitism as something sort of naughty , like gambling for too high stakes or not holding your liquor . " Phil finished reading the replies and waited for Miss Wales . She knew the only purpose of these letters was research for the series . She flipped over another letter , smiling and unperturbed . With the best will in the world , Phil told himself , they do n't give a damn because it 's nothing that 'll ever touch them . " I 'll start a file for replies , now , " she said cheerfully . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cs . " It 'll he good material for your pieces . " She gave him a look that was part encouragement , part boredom . " If your name was Irving Green or Saul or something , it would n't have worked this way . " He looked at her quickly . " Vc 'll have a cross check all right . " " I changed mine , " she said casually . " Did you ? " " Wales ? No , mine was always Green . What was yours ? " His voice h ; rd shown no surprise . " Walovsky , Fstcllc Walovsky . I could n't take it . About applications , I mean . " She shrugged , matter-of-factly . " So once I wrote the same firm two letters , same as you 're doing . I wrote the Elaine Vales one after they 'd said there were no openings to my first letter . I got the job all right . " " Damn . " " You know what firm that was ? " She waited . She seemedI00to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Weekly , " she said demurely . " You 're kidding ! " " The great liberal magazine , " she went on with a kind of impishness , " that fights injustice on all sides . It slays me . I love it . " " Brother ! Does Minify " I guess he ca n't bother thinking about the small fry . That 's Jordan 's stuff . If anybody snitched , you know there 'd be some excuse for throwing them out . " She jerked her thumb toward the window , and Phil stared at it till she dropped her hand . " So , anyway , I thought maybe you 'd changed yours sometime , " she went on . " I mean , when I heard you were . " " You heard it ? You mean before I told you ? " " Sure . Everybody knew it the next day . " Then his job of " working it in " had been done for him ? But how ? Who had bothered ? And how was it done ? Never in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about another , " He 's Jewish , you know . " That must have been spoken about him at once . By Anne Dettrey ? By Frank Tingler ? By Bert McAnny ? Possibly Minify himself , to help launch the thing ? No . He could not imagine John Minify saying the words , either . " He 's Catholic . " " He 's a Jew . " To talk of another man in the vocabulary of religious distinctions would go against Minify 's grain as it would against his own . He waved to the letters she was gathering together . " Does that kind of stuff get you sore ? " " Not any more . Yes , sure it does . So what ? " She shrugged , and with the same imperturbable look in her eyes she left the room . He looked after her . The Nordic type ; the Aryan type . He lit a cigarette . He must search out that article Life had run a couple of years ago by Hooton ofIOIHarvard about the balderdash of race and types . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd have a little fun telling Minify about things . The telephone rang again . Maybe this time . " Hello  --  oh , Kathy . You back ? " " It was such a lovely witty present , Phil . First I laughed and then I sort of hugged it . " " I 'm glad . You 'll be getting a grimy note from Tom sometime  --  he went nuts over the gun . When can I see you ? " " Any time . " " Right now , tonight , tomorrow , I missed you these four days . I wish we were married . " " Phil . " So , he had said it at last . Here , at an office desk , his elbow on a stack of notes and papers , into a perforated black disk he had said the words he 'd forced back into his throat all that evening before she 'd gone away . " It 's a hell of a way to say it , " he said , " is n't it ? " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I missed you , too , " she said slowly . " Just awfully . " I Ic saw the picture when he came in . The old one that had been over the fireplace lay flat on the piano , and his present hung in its place . Pleasure darted through him , but he said nothing . She knew he had seen it , and remained silent with him . I le took her into his arms . Standing tight to each other , saying nothing , they knew no importance other than the one streaming close about them in this double admission of longing . The tentative was gone . The surprise was gone . Acknowledgment , compulsion , sureness  --  these they shared . Later , leaning over her , he looked at her and found tranquillity and an odd return of shyness . IO2 " Darling . My beautiful Kathy . " She smiled and turned away from his asking , knowing that he wanted her to say it , not knowing how to say it . " You do n't look grim and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . " " Is n't it " She looked at him and then away . The question hung in the air . " When it 's all mixed with being in love , yes . " He waited . " So damn beautiful you ca n't bear it , I mean me . " " Me , too . " All night they forgot to sleep , except in snatches of drowsy silence which were half sleep . They talked with the candor that could come only in intimacy and confessed love . Already each felt a new loyalty to the other sketching in its first outlines beyond the old loyalty clinging to anything past . She could make him see more now , about her marriage , and he more about his stubborn suffering for Betty . Each had sought , each had hoped and watched for a new beginning , and now together they had found the way to it . " Should we meet our families first ? " Kathy said once . " Or after we 're married and surprise them ? " " Which way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was settled , no question fully answered , through all the hours until the windows showed graying streaks around the drawn shades . There was no time or need now for decisions . There was all the time . Only when he was dressed and sitting on the edge of her bed for a last cigarette did they come to specifics . " Darling , I 'll tell Mom in the morning . Come and meet her tomorrow ? I 'll stop by after the office . " " All right . And Tom ? " " Let 's have him get to know you first . Then after he likes you we 'll tell him . He 'll be so happy . " 103 " Sure ? " " Sure . I guess it 's better for him to like you first , do n't you ? " " Then maybe tomorrow 'd be better after he 's asleep ? " He nodded . " We 'll take him to a movie together for a start . That 'll make him all easy with you . " He took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm around her still bare shoulders , shot a lewdness through him , unwanted , dismaying . He spoke somberly . " You 're not sorry , darling , about Tom ? " " Oh , Phil . You know I 'm glad . " She hesitated . " It 'll be almost as if my marriage had n't all been wasted  --  as if all those years I 'd had a boy growing up for me . " I ie suddenly stood up . " I 'm a Christ-bitten fool , " he said , and heard how thick his voice was . Then he left her . Behind , alone , hearing him walk through the living room , hearing hinr click off the lights they 'd forgotten , guessing that he looked once more at the framed print of the Toledo over the fireplace , Kathy lay in a confusion of fatigue and happiness that banished sleep for another while . He could n't know , she would tell him sometime after they were married , but now she could n't utter the words to tell him how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't expected it . She had n't guessed that with his moodiness , his complexity , he would have so simple and driving a power to move her . If she had speculated , she 'd have guessed he 'd he a nervous , unsure lover . It mattered so much  --  no marriage had half a chance if the two were constantly frustrate or anxious about sex . Phil , she thought . I ) arling . I 'll make him happy , I can help him , I 'm good for being married . All the rest of it about Betty will disappear without his even knowing when it finally slides off into nothingness . I can make Tom feel right ; I 'm good with children ; 104why would n't I be with this one when I want to so much ? And we 'll have our own . She reached for a final cigarette , changed her mind , and turned out the light . In the dark she thanked something for having made it happen and did not try to name what it was she thanked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when you felt this good . His mother 's pleasure over the news that they 'd marry in a week or two had only made him indulgent , not uneasy and embarrassed . Whistling , he finished dressing and went back to his desk for the morning 's batch of hotel letters . Mrs. Green was still sitting there . Tom was already out . " The story about Miss Wales made Kathy laugh , too , " he said . He did n't want the talk to get back to personal levels . " She was delighted I had n't told Minify yet  --  wants to be around when I dish it out . " Kathy had been angry about Dr. Craigie , had sniffed over Bill Johnson of the Times . He had forgotten to tell her about Belle 's telephone call . One of those shame-caused repressions ? Sometime around midnight they 'd remembered they 'd had no dinner and they 'd gone into the small kitchen for scrambled eggs and toast and milk . While they were there , they 'd been able again to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " everything that 's happened so far . " Sitting there , while she cooked for him , talking of his work , was like a rehearsal of married life . But he could report only episodes ; the nebulous world of his own developingfeeling he had to inhabit alone . So far , even for himselfit remained uncharted . " That thing about Miss Wales is the only thing that 's been amusing , " Mrs. Green said . He came to with a start . The letters were still in his hand. ro5 " Funny thing , " he said , " the way I felt so man-to-man with Miss Wales when she pitched me that one . Asking her right out how she felt , as if we both were really on the inside . I keep forgetting it 's just an act . " She looked at him thoughtfully . " I suppose that 's what 's called Identification . ' " " I did n't think it would come so fast . " " What does Kathy think about it ? " " I told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ? " " Oh . She fretted about it some , pitfalls , stuff like that . She 's all for it . " " When 's Dave due ? " she asked without transition . " Maybe tomorrow . Maybe next month . You know the army . " Ile went off , ready for Dave , ready for more letters , ready fur work and effort and anything . Never try to dismaya man , he thought in the taxi , about anything in the world the morning after he 's made love to his girl . Kathy 's face came hack , hesitant , a touch surprised . A primitive sense of achievement and self-satisfaction filled him . She 'd thought he 'd be a goddam intellectual about everything ! In the half-d ; rrk of the cab he sat back , trying to ready himself for the moment just ahead , the cab pulling up , the flag shoved upright , the making of change and the offer of the tip . The office was there , the series was there , the watching himself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Identification . " In a way he was kidding himself . Alwayshe knew that for him it would come to an end when he gave the word . That must make it different . He alone had an escape clause in his contract . A dart of relief nipped at hirn . Jee-sus , he thought then . I 'm goddam smug myself . Of it , yet also apart . The actor on the boards and the io6watching audience in the dark beyond . The lumberjack with his ax and the tree awaiting the blow . The invasion barge and the empty beach . The giver and taker at once . It was fallacy . It could achieve nothing true . He 'd embarked on a sort of Dostoevskian insoluble , dark , brooding , ending only in uncertainty . He should never have started it . At best it was an approximation ; at worst a fraud . The taxi stopped . The driver 's arm reached out to the white flag on the meter . Phil opened the door . On the street , sunlight blazed ; cold air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . Minify was alone . " It 's no good , John , " he began . " The damn idea 's a phony from the word go . " John looked up , startled . " It 's glib and trumped up and fake , " Phil went on . " I 've got an out ' all the time , and no real Jew has . My unconsciousknows about that out ' even if I forget it . " " Hold on , there " I 'm starting over . There 'll be some other angle that is n't slick like this one . " Now John cut him short . " For God 's sake , stop psychoanalyzingit . " His words were brisk with irritation . " It 's a good angle  --  nobody said it was perfect . But it 's a new springboard into the thing , and that 's good . " Phil started to answer , but Minify waved him silent . " You had an ' out ' all the time you were a miner , did n't you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not the usual , run-of-the-mill miner , to mix a phrase . " He sat back ; the annoyed look left him . " There was nothing slick and fake in that series , Phil . You 're just having the usual attack of ' it 's lousy  --  I 'm lousy . ' " Phil thought , Maybe that 's all it comes to , and wished he 'd thought it over longer before coming in . Then he saw Minify smile. 107 " And if the first couple articles do turn out n.g. , " John said calmly , " we 've got a good out ' ourselves . " He kicked the wastebasket beside the desk . Phil looked down at the basket and laughed . " Escape clause , " he said . " O.K. I 'd overlooked that . " Reassured , he went back to his office and got to work . It was after six before he was ready to leave . Kathy had sounded happy when he phoned , and tired , and had sug- gested waiting until eight so she could nap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All afternoon he 'd worked with his usual intensity ; he was writing now as well as carrying on the research . ' I'hc writing was going well ; it pleased him . But he was tired , too . Ile went through the reception room , dim and emptied of its authors and salesmen and portfolios . Bert McAnny , the assistant art editor , and Anne Dettrey were out in the hall , waiting for the elevator . " I 'm hushed , " Anne greeted him . " Getting the book to bed gets worse every issue . " " I thought we were n't to call it the book ' around here , " Bert said . I le pushed the DOWN button again . " True , t rue , " Anne said . " Anyway , what about a getting- to-bed drink ? Sound cozy ? " They all laughed . " How 's about it ? " They decided on the Oak Room and walked to the Plaza . Phil felt at ease with them , as though he 'd been on the staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you worked at home , the lazily given " inside dope " that seemed curi- ously important : " Say , Luce paid fifty thousand for Church- ill 's articles "  --  " When ( 10 they start ? "  --  " February . I hear he 's fighting with Field for the autobiography "  --  " Jim told me the bidding was around a million already . " As they turned into Fifty-ninth Street , Bert began to talk with relish about a new illustrator he 'd discovered . " He 's a kind of Io8 modern Leyendecker , " he said . " Same outfit in the arm and the minute I saw some doodles he did , I knew I had it . " " Leyendecker ? " Anne said . " You were in three-corner ( pants when Leyendecker " I know them all the way back , " Bert said . " This kid got it . Little Jew boy from the Bronx , but he sure has got i Signed him for the Dohen serial . " There was a pause . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affe tionate and proud of this kid . Aloud he said , " What 's h name ? Anybody ever hear of him ? " " Jacob Her " Bert stopped then . He 's rememberirabout me , Phil thought , and embarrassment for Bert wash ( over him . " Jake Hermann , " Bert hurried on . " Fine stul all right . He 'll hit every cover on the stands in two years , Enthusiasm in the voice , pride , alliance . Do n't be boti ered by idoms and expressions , Phil counseled himself . Be : feels like a jackass over the thing . But he thought of Belle Jew-us-down . Over their drinks they talked about plays and movies an the difference in the holiday mood this year . Bert had misse all the war Christmases , he said , so he could n't catch th difference . It was Anne who asked about the series . " I 'm still just getting stuff together , " Phil said depreca ingly . " God knows there 's plenty around . " " Too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McAnny shifted in his chair . " You a correspondent during the war ? " he asked PhiInstantly Phil was hostile . He rescinded the excuses h had made before . He said , " What makes you think I wasn right in it ? " " I just  --  hey , do n't be oversensitive now . " " I was with the Marines on Guad . First Divisior 109Eleventh Regiment Artillery . " Do n't be oversensitive . Jews are oversensitive . " Jew boy " is just an expression  --  let it pass . But how directly Bert had leaped from Anne 's " too much antisemitism " to " were you a correspondent ? " That fool mind was clearly taping even war correspondents as inferiors , so the train of thought meant , being a Jew , did you choose a cushy berth in the war ; were you a slacker ? Idioms , expressions , forgcttings , associated ideas . Flick . Tap . " You do n't wear your ribbons , do you , Phil ? " Anne put in quietly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No . " I le looked clown at his own lapel . " I do n't . " He saw her smiling at him , friendly , teamed against Bert . He smiled back . I lc knew Bert had seen the exchange . " For ( ; od 's sake , 1'liil , " he exploded . " I 'm no antisemite . Why , some of nay best " " I know , dear , " Anne put in , " and some of your other best friends are Methodists , but you never bother saying it . Skip it . I'Iiil , flag the old boy for another Manhattan , there 's a clear . " Bert could n't stay another round because of an appointment . When they were alone , Anne said , " Little Squirt . " " I suppose Minify does n't come into contact with him much , " 1'liil said reflectively . " That day at lunch --  " " 1 le was in " l'ingler 's office , so he came along . John does n't know anybody the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too big . " She grinned comfortably and pitched her voice to imitate Bert . " For God 's sake , Phil , I 'm no antisemite . ' I lc believes that . IIe disapproves of Bilbo and Gerald L. K. Smith and the poll tax and religious prejudice . Really says so . I Ie 's just a little snot , let 's face it . " He laughed . She was refreshing . And she liked him . He looked at her , more personally attentive than he 'd yet been . She was certainly an attractive and colorful girl . Her hatIIOwas a silly thing like a man 's black Homburg swathed in dark brown veil , but it was becoming . " Tell you what , " she said . " I 'm having a flock of people up New Year 's Eve . What about pressing out your black tie and coming up ? " " I 'd like that , " he said . " Can I bring my girl ? " " Of course , " she said . Her expression changed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SEVENKATHY SAID , " Wo n't we have to let Jane in on it ? " He looked quickly at her . " I had n't thought . " " I had n't , either , till now . " She smiled at him . " She 's dying to meet you . I sort of blurted the news on the phone , and she squealed ' bath-ecee ' as if she 'd given up all hope . " He nodded as a preoccupied parent does when a child prattles . She waited . Then she said , " Phil , my own sister ? " Ile sat forward in his chair and studied the flames in the fireplace . A minute ago there 'd been still the good pleasure of watching her with his mother . Almost a proprietary thing it was , as if Iic 'd not only found Kathy but created her out of his own talents and materials . 1Ie 'd been impatient for his mother to leave them , but now that she had there 'd been this question and the sunny feeling had fogged over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ll mot her wrote them . But they know I 'm not Jewish . Jane and I lorry do n't . After all , if you want to keep a secret , the only way " But , Phil . Would n't it be sort of exaggerated , with mysister , your sister-in-law almost. , It was so logical . But logic  --  he stood up , poked the fire , threw on a heavy log . It clattered sparks and chips off the burning wood , and with the side of his shoe he shoved each glowing bit back from the slate hearth . " Jane was engaged to a boy named Sidney Pearlman , " she said at last , " and he died of pneumonia and she nearly went crazy for a long time . " " What 's the point ? " The harsh tone , the stern pounceII2of the disciplinarian  --  he regretted them even before her quick , " Phil , really ! " " I 'm sorry . " " There is a point , darling , " she went on reasonably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be pretty inflexibleof you " Her glance was inviting him to be as reasonable as she . Somewhere there was the neat and simple syllogism that would present no flaw to her , but he was too perplexed to find it . He was on the defensive  --  how had he got there ? She got up and came to him . She put her arm through his . " Do n't you see , Phil ? " " I suppose so . " It sounded grudging , and he added , " Insidethe family . " " That 's all I meant . " She squeezed his arm . " They 'd never breathe it . " " No point running things into the ground , I guess . " Exaggerated . Inflexible . Waiting for sleep , hours later , Phil suddenly remembered Pop and the interest . " But it is unearned increment , Mattie . " He could imagine his father as a young man saying it earnestly to his astonishedwife . Thirty-two years ago , that had been , and their first savings account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an 0.72 , the interest on their fortune . Phil had heard the tale a dozen times . " Of course I ca n't accept it . " " Are you going to give it back to the bank ? " " Certainly not . But if you believe a thing 's evil , you ca n't give in just because the amount is small . " He 'd gone off into a lecture which would now be called " Old-Fashioned Socialism . " " Then what are you going to do with it ? " " I 'll think of something . " 113All through his life , his father had refused to make personaluse of a penny of interest . Each year he would do a meticulous calculation and send off a check to something he believed in . It was never a charity in the accepted sense . Before 1917 , he 'd sent it to an organization for the defense of political prisoners in Russia ; when the Ku Klux Klan was raging in the early twenties , he 'd sent it to a group fighting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd mailed his little checks there . He never forgot , never relented . It was exaggerated , it was laughable . But it was curiously admirable , too . Phil rarely thought of his father any more , but when he did he always carne on some hard little nubbin like this . It was one of the inevitables in a man like Stephen Slater Green . " 1 f you compromise , " he used to say , " you 're corrupt . " Character , principle , ethic , whatever one called it , was the deciding factor in every life , in every society . Even in the various religions of the world , there was a common extract , the ethic behind the shell of creed . One could reject the shell with no impairment to the essence . But without the essence one was lost . Phil stretched his arms high above his head and yawned deeply . I I is wrist struck the bed lamp , and the cigarette still in his lingers shook ashes down over him . Impatiently he brushed them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a hell of a time to remember Pop and his large-scale talk about ethics . The mind was never a respecterof appropriateness . In the instant of giving in about Jane and Harry he could see Kathy 's mouth and want her ; he could write a phrase for the series and wonder what movie they should choose for Tom ; he could leave Kathy 's side and dredge out of his memory the red handwriting in the interest column . Unexpectedly , as he was leaving tonight , she 'd held herI14arms out to him . " Comparisons are awful , darling , but I never was so happy before . " They each had comparisons in them ; always the later love came equipped with the earlier and with the gray knowledge of what had happened to it and could happen again . Perhaps the knowledge of that mortality added depth as well as fear to the new ; else why this passionate resolve in him to let no disaster strike this time ? " Never so happy before . " He had n't consciously measuredor compared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy he 'd known with Betty when he 'd been a boy of twenty-five ? There was in him now the gritty residue of burned-out grief ; with Betty long ago he had been an innocentlover in the true sense of the word , guileless toward the future . He ground out his cigarette in the ash tray and turned out the light . They could take Tommy to see Danny Kaye inWonder Man . At the office next morning , Miss Wales was upset . " I do n't know what I was thinking of . I switched aboutten of the applications to colleges and medical schools . " " Oh , well . " " But the answers wo n't be delivered . The post office will mark them Unknown . ' " She had just discovered from her carbons that she 'd typed in the Minify address on a batch of Greens and his own on the corresponding Greenbergs . Her professional confidence was shaken ; two or three times she pointed out that she never made mistakes , and this was awful . " If you lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not where there are letter boxes downstairs . " " I 'll just write in his name on our card down there . " " Oh . " Relief smoothed her face . " I never thought of that . " 115Past the open door Bert McAnny went by with his boss , Bill Jayson , and Sam Goodman , Tingler 's assistant on fiction . As they called " Morning , " Jayson stopped , looked in , and then came in . McAnny went on with Goodman . " Photographs , would you guess ? " Jayson started . " For your series ? " " I had n't thought . " Miss Wales left . Bill Jayson sat down . He was short and thin , with an odd toed-out gait . In the one brief talk they 'd already had , Phil had noticed the pedantic way he enunciated every syllable , but there was an earnestness in him that was attractive . " I thought nonfiction always called for photographic treatment . " " John says you have some special angle that might shiftthat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skip it for now. " hlicn it 'll turn out oils , and I 'll be in hell rushing them . " " I 'll give you plenty of time . " " It 's the devil , illustrating a series like that . Why all the mystery ? John would n't give me a line . " " Well , it 's better this way for a bit . " He took one of the two cigarettes Jayson held out in his fingers . Friendly little guy. " iIcAnny just told me about yesterday , " Jayson went on carefully . " 11c 's always doing something . Knows his job , though . " " Sure . " 1 le looked at Jayson . " How come he told you ? " Jayson made a sound that could only be described as a titter . " 1 lc 's scared of Dettrey , I think . " Phil laughed . Jaysonwent on , " Look , could I make a highly personal remark ? " " Go ahead . " Jayson looked unhappy . I Ie scowled . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't keep a  --  do n't wear a chip on your shoulder , Green . " " Do I ? " I16 " I used to , about being five foot two , " he went on solemnly . " Looking for tactless remarks all day long . Then I just said to myself that everybody 's got a low riling point on something . " " That 's true enough . Have I ? I did n't think " Well , just telling everybody you 're a Jew right off . What the hell business is it of anybody ? " " I ought n't mention it ? " Jayson 's scowl returned . He pursed his lips like a pettish child . Then he shook his head . " I guess that would n't go either . Then they 'd say you were hiding it . Hell of a note , is n't it ? " They grinned at each other . Going up the stairs that evening , Phil was in a cheerful mood . The long New Year 's week end was coming up . Exceptfor deadline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly he remembered his promise to Miss Wales . He went down again to the vestibule and stopped in front of the shining brass plate of bells and letter boxes . He stooped and printed CAPT . J. GREENBERG above the typed name on his box . Behind him the door opened . " Evening , Mr. Green . " It was the superintendent for the three adjoining houses of which this was one . " Nice night , " Phil said , and put his key again in the hall door . Behind him Mr. Olsen made a sound . Phil turned and saw Olsen leaning down to the printed name . " You could fill out one of them cards at the post office , better , " he said . He did n't look at Phil . " Or watch for the mailman and tell him . " " What 's the matter with this way ? " " Rule . " He reached into his vest pocket and brought out a pencil . Phil saw him turn it upside down . The eraser moved toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the order as he 'd done in uniform . Olsen stopped short . He met Phil 's eyes then , his own plaintive . " It 's nothin ' I can help , Mr. Green . It 's the rules . Not in these three houses . The broker should of explained , that is , excuse me , if you are . " " Excuse me , hell . This place is mine for two years , and you do n't touch that sign . " " I 'll have to repor Phil slammed the door in his face . Queasy rage rode him . Upstairs he went directly to his own room . This sullen moron of a janitor . The rules . He 'd seen the owner of these three buildings just once , back in September . Alma Martin was one of those rich widows you saw in movies and never met . At the time he 'd merely noted the flash of rings , the beaded eyelashes , the lacy bosom and vulgar voice . Now a hateful snobbery sprang high in him . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whore who could n't get into a cultivated household actually would keep him out of her three citadels ! He and Dave and anybody Jewish were to he kept off the premises . I Ic ought to laugh , but laughter was n't in him . Every day the thump of insult , the assault on your dignity . The rules of the Alma Martins and Joe Olsens . The flicks of the McAnnys and Craigies , nice intelligent people who scorned the lunatic fringe and would n't have Alma Martin in their houses either . Do n't wear a chip on your shoulder . Do n't be oversensitive . And do n't be clannish . He 'd heard that one , too . The trouble with Jews is they 're so clannish . If one of them moves into an apartment house , why , pretty soon the whole house is nothing but Jews . Or a hotel or a neighborhood . They just do n't want to mix . And the ones that do mix easilyI18and melt right in with everybody , why , they 're so quick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so thin-skinned , Izzy . Do n't withdraw from the clever little flick , do n't stay off in groups where the tap , tap , tap ca n't get at you and madden you with drop-of-water persistence . This is America , and there are no torture chambersin Detroit or Boston or St. Paul . Why fret ? Nine months ? Two weeks was enough . He 'd been doing this for less than two weeks and he 'd changed . A mutation had been produced in the bunched nerves , in the eardrums that caught nuance , in the very corneas that gave him sight . Already when he glanced at the over-all gray of a page of the Times , if the word " Jew " was printed anywhere on it , that word leaped into his vision . Already when somebody started a story about Izzy Epstein or Mrs. Garfinkel , he felt his teeth on edge . Now the sly little phrases got no obliging deafness or excuses from him . How small a step remained before he might seethe with determination to " show them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fame , that would be impregnable ! Two weeks . Maybe the slow embryo in the patient womb needed nine months to reproduce the sweep from tadpole to man , but no such time was needed to re-create the reaction to prejudice . He 'd been a fool that night , a fancy maker of metaphor and simile . Whole history of persecution indeed . He 'd forgotten that the inheritance of acquired characteristicswas a myth . The baby born in the ghetto was as free of the history of persecution as it was free of its father 's skill at making neckties or mathematical formulae . But these teachers were soon met , and they taught their devious lessonsrapidly and well . He took the opening pages of his manuscript out of his pocket and threw it at the top of his dresser . It slithered across the mahogany and fell to the floor . I19 " That you , dear ? " He shook his head sharply as if to snap it free of concussionafter big guns had gone off . " Yeah . No office till Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up and absently beat the brittle tube against the side of his leg . That 's where he 'd pounded his thigh in that first sweep of elation . Over the radio , the shouts , toots , whistles notched up in intensity . " Half a minute to go , " somebody in the room called out . Anne moved through the crowd to the wall switch . Unnoticedbefore , the two lighted candles on the mantel sprang alive as the other lights went out . At the piano somebody played the opening bars of Auld Lang Sync . " Corny , " Kathy whispered , but her eyes glistened . " I lappy New Year , darling . " " 1lappv New Year . " They kissed . Around them wives kissed husbands , friends kissed friends . Corny . And curiously , stubbornly moving . The new year , the new hope , the peace , the stumbling effort of man ... . " It 's a grand party , Phil , " Kathy said . " Anne 's awfully attractive , is n't she ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She looks grand tonight . " " She certainly does , " Kathy said . " She likes you a lot . " He looked down at her , and she made a face . She said , smiling , " I 'll scratch her eyes out if she makes a play for you . " " You darling . " It delighted him that she should show possessiveness . Tonight was the first time , apart from their dinner last evening with the Minifys , that their relationship had become public . " My fiance , " Kathy had said twice when120she introduced him to people she knew . The afternoon with Tom and the movies had slid by on silk . In three days they were going for the wedding license . He leaned down so he could whisper to her . " Let 's not stay around too long . You look pretty damn grand yourself . " She was in a long black dress held up by shoestrings . " In this ? It 's four years old . " " And still sexy as hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I wish Bill would get married this year , too . " " Bill ? " It sounded stupid . " Oh , yes , Bill . " " Pawling , " she said . " My ex-husband . He dropped in today to say Happy New Year , and I told him about us . He was awfully effusive with good wishes . It made me sad for him . " He did n't say anything . When somebody came up to Kathy just then , he was glad to have the subject changed . It was a good party , as Kathy had said , not merely good for lovers . This was what people could find in New York if they were fortunate , the good mixture of talent and interests and ideas . There were Joe Lieberman , the physicist ; Jerry Torrence , the novelist , with his beautiful wife ; Jascha Rimitov , the violinist , and his gifted wife , who was his accompanist . Lawyers , businessmen , a Congressman up from Washington , one of the younger men in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The faces in the room were various with many kinds of origin ; the speech mingled the accents of Middle West , East , and West , of Europe and America . This , the fluid easy coming together of a dozen worlds , was the bonus life set aside for the luckier ones in the metropolises of the earth . The small city , the town and village , could not offer it . To Phil , grown in small cities and towns , it was as stimulating as the champagne  --  " Domestic , I2I dears , " Anne had said  --  that he 'd been drinking all evening . Here was a world where a man 's name , the shape of his nose , the religion he believed in or the religion he did not believe in  --  where none of it counted . Here was rugged in- dividualism in its best sense , each man or woman a whole person , the sum of his worth and character left whole , no part subtracted by prejudice . He 'd been pleased to see Lieberman there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get us together . I 'm Phil Green . " " He told me lac ( lid . " They shook hands . Only yesterday John had told Phil he 'd talked to Lieberman about him . " I 'm not as easy as you are , Phil , about sliding it into a sentence , but I got it across to him . " Lieberman was plump as well as short , middle-aged , with the face of a.Ecw in a Nazi cartoon , the beaked nose , the blue jowls , and the curling black hair . Phil saw all of it , and the line candid eyes . " I 'm writing a series for him on antisemitism . " " Pro or con ? " Phil roared , and Lieberman 's eyes twinkled . He seemed pleased with himself , affectionate toward his quick retort , rewarded by Viol 's outburst as by a just reward . " And John thought we might hash over some ideas . I ex- pect you 're pretty busy these days . " Lieberman shook his head in denial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , Zionism , ) " Which ? Palestine as refuge or Zionism as a movement for a Jewish state ? " " The confusion between the two , more than anything . " " Good . If we agree there 's confusion , we can talk . I ca n't really talk to a positive Zionist any more than to a con- firmed Communist  --  there is no language . " 122 They talked on for a bit and agreed to meet soon . In the taxi uptown , Phil and Kathy discussed the party . She was voluble and gay , with excitement , with champagne . " I thought I 'd die at some of the jokes she told , " she said , and laughed in reminiscence . Anne had revealed a gift for mimicry he 'd only glimpsed when she 'd imitated Bert , and for over an hour she 'd regaled one corner of the room with story after story , most of them old ones refurbished with current build-ups and made newly engaging by her uncanny ear for dialect . " If McAnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd have been puckered as a quince . Why the hell is it so different ? " Kathy shook her head , and they went on in silence . It could be different . With Anne , and in that crowd , you could laugh at a joke about two priests or two Jews or two Negroes and hear no overtone of cruelty . Kathy and he had shouted over the chestnut about Mandy and the colored judge and again at the one about " Lord Chahmly-Chahmly " getting the wrong telephone connection . " So he gets this little old fellow in the Bronx , you know , long beard , black skullcap , and says , I say , is Freddy Breckstontheah ? ' " Who-o-o- ? Who you vant ? ' " Breckston , old chap , Lord Harrowbridge Turnbridge Pethbright , y'know . ' " Oi ! I-Iev you got the wrung numbair 1 ' " In the dim cab , Kathy heard him chuckle and said , " Phil ? " He took her into his arms . " I 'm just so damn happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stood looking down at her as she sat at one end of the sofa . Disbelief , acknowledgment warred through him . His mind strained for understanding , the ache of trying told him it was beyond his reach. 123 " God , Kathy , we 're quarreling . " " I said we should n't talk it out now . It 's nearly four , we had stuff to drink , we 're just worn out . " Her face was pale . Her dejected limpness was an accusation . " All right . Let 's quit it . " He stood up and began pacing the room . " I know I promised , Phil . I crossed my heart . No exceptions . And you were being reasonable to stretch it to Jane . But it just seems so silly to get her into a thing up there when it 's not true . " Women always talk in italics , he thought , when they know they 're wrong . She must see this is impossible . Aloud he said , " The whole goddam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's convenient , that 's all . " " She did n't mean for you to deny it . Just not to bring it up . " I le did n't say anything . They 'd been over this five times already since she 'd unlocked the front door and said , " Oh , I forgot . Jane wants to throw a big party for us Saturday night . " She 'd switched on only one lamp in the living room , made a comedy gesture of chucking off her short cape and letting it lie on the rug , and curled up against banked cushions with an unshielded yawn like a child . He 'd sat near her , unsuspicious of danger , tired also , and unwilling to admit he ought to be on his way at once . " What 'd she say when you told her ? " " Oh , she thought it was the cleverest way to do research and that you must have a touch of the screwball in you to think it up . " " But she promised ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry , too . Anyway , today when she phoned , she asked if you 'd just skip the whole thing for the party and I said " " No . " I24 " What ? " " You said , No , he wo n't skip the whole thing for the party . ' " " Why , Phil , I did n't . I said I 'd ask you . " He 'd stood abruptly then . " Ask me ? " " I 'd never say yes without asking you . " " You mean I should ? " She looked away . " You know those suburban crowds . EspeciallyDarien and up there . It would just start a whole mess for Jane and Harry for nothing . " " And if it were a mess for something ? " " But , Phil , you 're not . So  --  oh , you can be solemn about things . It 'll just ruin the party for Jane if she has problems at it . " " Why not just tell Jane to skip the party ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queer  --  her only sister . " She made an impatient gesture . " If you were I 'd manage , but " Thanks . " Again the look stood in her eyes . ( " But , Phil , you 're not really , are you ? " ) The look he 'd found excuses for  --  the mind plays funny tricks , you 're not Minify , I should have led you along . This time the look was n't caused by unpreparednessor misunderstanding . This time it was just there . Over and over , they 'd gone at it , round and round . She could n't see it , and he could n't make her see it . He could n't see it , and she could n't make him see it . " Nobody 's asking you to make loopholes where it counts , " she went on now . " At the office , or meeting people right here like at Anne 's tonight . But out there 's just an occasionalvisit , and if we use my house for next summer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were so grand . " 125 " They are . But they ca n't help it if some of their friends  --  and they 'd be saying our future brother-in-law ' or maybe our brother-in-law ' by then , and it would make such a " A thing . A mess . An inconvenience . " " Well , it would ! " " Just for Jane and Ilarry ? Or for you , too ? " " Damn it , I 'd be so tensed up I would n't have any fun either . Heavens , if everything 's going to be tensed up and solemn all the time Her voice was hard . Iler eyes avoided his . " If . " Suddenlyhe was unbearably tired . " I think I 'd better go now , " he said . Outside , a misty cold hung over the still-wet streets . Numbly he walked down Park Avenue . The Christmas lights were dead on the long single line of trees down the center islands of earth . Taxis whooshed by on the puddled road , but he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ le walked all the way . In the dim vestibule of his house the brass plate gleamed softly . I lc shoved his key into the door . On his pillow two yellow telegrams were placed where he could nut miss them even if he undressed in the dark . He reached to the headboard lamp . They were both addressed to him . Ile tore one open . CONGRATULATIONS ON THE GRAND NEWS ABOUT YOU AND KATHY AND MY BEST TO HER . LET 'S HEAR TILE EXACT DATE . LOVE FROM ALL . BELLE . He ripped apart the second envelope . It was unsigned . It had been sent that evening from Brentwood , California . YIPPEE . He sat down on the bed and put his head down on his hands . The telegram from his sister Mary crackled slowly in his tightening fist. 126CHAPTER EIGHTTHROUGH HIS SLEEP he heard the telephone ring . He woke sweating and heavy with the familiar weight of depression . For a second he was back in the dragging morningsof California years ago . The radiator spat steam from its leaky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn it off when he 'd finally gone to bed . Back of the closed door Tom called , " It 's for you , Dad . " He sprang up . " Right there . " The door opened , and Tom said , " He asked for LieutenantGreen , not Mister . Gram said to wake you . " " He ? " The heaviness hit again . " Who ? " " Gee , I just said to wait . I answered it . " " O.K. Pretty late , is n't it ? " He glanced at his watch as he went into the living room . It was past noon . The last time he 'd checked , it had been nearly eight . He picked up the receiver and offered it an inert " Hello . " " Phil , it 's Dave . " " Dave ? Why , damn you ! Where are you ? When 'd you get in ? " He heard Dave laugh at the burst of pleasure in his own voice . " LaGuardia . Just now . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my CO . " " Grab a cab . If you 're broke , hold him downstairs . " " Hell , I 'm not broke . Boy , it 's good to be back . " " Well , come on . I have n't even had breakfast yet . " He showered and then carried a cup of black coffee into the bathroom . He sipped and then gulped it while he shaved . His eyes smarted , his eyelids were too small . Hang-127over . Only it was n't just hangover . He jerked away from remembering . That wound-up spring inside somewhere  --  that was depression in the clinical sense of the psychiatrist 's office . In the mirror his face looked sullen and dead . A pan clattered to the floor in the kitchen . He squinted as if sudden light instead of sound offended his nerves . He wished he could be alone in the house , with no noise , no talk , no questions about last night 's party . Dave was a break . Man 's talk it would be , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old job or a new one . Good old Dave , thank God for Dave , Dave who did n't know a damn thing about Kathy . " If things are going to be all tense and solemn all the time . " " Then what ? " I Ie should have said it at once . He should have made her finish the sentence , verbalize the threat implicitin the tone she used . " We 'd better not get married after all . " " C'hat 's how she 'd have ended it . He might as well have heard it , then , not let it hang in the air , a warningto behave , to be lighthearted about things . He had shrunk from hearing it , had gone wise with a soft wisdom and said he 'd better leave now . He should have faced her . Told her . " Things will be tense and solemn plenty of the time , " he should have said . " I 'm a guy that gets tense , see ? I snarl up and I goddam well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forget about other things . Damn it to hell , that 's the way I am . If you do n't want my kind of man , O.K. , no harm done . Better now than later . " All those things he 'd crumpled into a dignified silence while he made a dignified exit . Afraid to slug it out lest he lose her . You love a woman and you lose her  --  Christ , how do you stand it a second time ? You do n't  --  you crawl into a shell and stifle . All the sentences addressed to her later were so fine and right , but they were spoken only in the safe roomI28of his mind . And so this waking with fear , shame , depression  --  theclinical trio , the three sisters pursuingHe leaned down over the basin and slogged his face with the stinging cold of winter water as if he were beating himself . As he sat talking with Dave , a preference for male companionshipbeat through him , surly , superior . Women talked of parties , of family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Dave was what a man needed , this bone and muscle for the mind instead of pale plump softness . This men 's talk was all in the hard clean outlines of battle , impossiblebridges to be built under fire , the split of the atom , the greed of looting armies . Dave had begun in Italy and gone on through the whole business of D Day and the rest . He 'd been wounded and mended and thrown back in . Womenclawed softly at your manhood . War and work and the things you believed in gave it back to you . This gave it back to you , lounging in opposite chairs , taking the good short cuts men could take who 'd been through the same things , fiddling through long drinks , arguing , differing or agreeing , but always tight on the tracks of reality . Separation and time had made him forget how much he liked Dave . He 'd told Minify they were n't especially close any more , yet when Dave had dumped his bag down and they 'd stood there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been seized with the old excess of feeling he 'd had as a kid for " my best friend . " Dave seemed taken by the same kind of upheaval , mixed in his case with the emotions of coming home at last . For him this was a homecomingby proxy , with Tom awestruck at his ribbons , Mrs. Green saying , " Well , Dave , why , Dave , " and the house all astir to give him food , make him comfortable . Phil found himself studying Dave 's face as they talked. 129He looked older , he seemed quieter . Was it just that three years had passed ? Was it still the stamp of war and distanceand loneliness , which would rub off soon under the caress of ordinary life ? Or was Dave the holder of new knowledge which really aged and toughened the whole stuff of which his body and mind and understanding were compounded ? He saw the thinning hair , the uneven groove between the eyebrows which showed clear now even when Dave was n't frowning ; he saw , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top fitness that army living clamped hard to a man . " What 's this series ? " Dave asked . " We 'll get to it later . " Inexplicably he wanted to put off talking of what he was doing . A shyness pervaded him , as if he might seem to Dave like a kid caught playing at a man 's game . ' i'hey went back to their discussion of Dave 's plans . 1 le was going to move his family East as Phil had done and was going to stay on now for part of his terminal leave to look over the ground . IIe 'd already had letters from his old boss assuring him that a good job could be arranged with one of several Eastern firms , but the housing shortage the , ltt defeat him , if it was as serious as the papers reported . Phil listened and replied . Yet now , submerged but insistent , the series was fingering his mind again . He looked at the expressive face opposite him with new attention while a silent quest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ) ; tve look Jewish ? Yes , he supposed he did , now that he asked it . He simply could not remember that he had ever thought the thing beforein all the years they 'd known each other . Where was it , this Jewishness ? Dave topped six feet as he did , a little heavier , with no fat but of a bigger bone . His nose was short , stubby even , no hint of hook or curve . Hair and eyes were brown , lighter than his own and , where the unshaved130stubble caught the last glint of sunlight from the window behind him , tinged with red blond . Yet if you thought , you 'd know this man was Jewish . It was there somewhere . In the indented arcs of the nostrils ? In the turn of his lips ? In the quiet eyes ? It was such a damn strong good face . " What 's eating you , Phil ? " " Me ? " " You 've been giving me the once-over for five minutes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and I started thinking what makes people look or not look Jew-ish . " " Come on , let 's get down to it . Who 's this Minify , anyway ? " Phil started at the beginning , his first jaundiced sureness that " it would be a lousy flop unless I caught hold of some hot idea . " Without surprise , he noted that Dave showed as little steam as he himself had , nodding judiciously , trying to visualize it as if he were also a writer , but not aroused . Obscurely it pleased him that Dave should react also on this low-voltage level . He 'd been right  --  they were just the same about things like this . He shoved back the tenuous shyness that persisted in him as he got nearer the point . Once Dave interrupted . " You expecting a call , Phil ? " " A call ? " " You keep looking at the phone every few minutes . " " Hell . " A moment later he added , " I had a scrap withmy girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to phone . " " Suppose I take that shower now ? " Phil shook his head and went on . He 'd got to the part . about the three books and found himself worked up all over again . " Why should n't they write about swinish Jews ? " Dave put in . " Do n't Christians write about swinish Christians ? " It brought him up short . He said , " Sure , but " and131then remained silent . Finally he shook his head , rejecting it . " It 's a question of timing , Dave . Fire-in-a-crowdedtheater . " He walked to the bookcase and took one of the books down , holding it flat on his palm as if he were guessingthe weight . " These authors are n't dopes . They know they can add to the panic by this kind of thing . " " Balls . If they wrote only about big beautiful Jewish heroes  --  you 'd get the business of glorifying . Chosen People Department . " Idly , Dave tapped his thumbnail against the edges of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like some new Morse code . " A two-thousand-year start on the master-race business , " he said coldly , " by one small bunch of crackpot Jews  --  and look how many generationshave n't paid it out . " " That 's a point . I never thought of it . " An excited twinge went through Phil . " I read it somewhere , " Dave said . " Does n't explain the whole thing  --  too many pat explanations all over the place . The big hole in this one is the world wo n't be persecuting Germans two thousand years from now because they fell for the same crap . I Ie went to the Scotch and poured himself another drink . IIe waved the bottle at Phil and then took it over to the glass he held up . ' ' But that 's not the point right now , Phil . Did you ever get your special angle ? " The odd reluctance arose again . It was n't the skeptical mistrust that had sent him in to Minify that morning . It was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been all right at the start , but now it disturbed him . Politely interested he was , nothing more . " Do n't you want a good stiff series in a big national magazine , Dave ? " " Me ? Sure . " " You sound bored . " " Hell , I 'm anything but . In my outfit  --  no , I 'll save that for later . It 's just " Dave smiled , as if in anticipation of his next sentence . " Well , I 'm on the side lines on antisemitism . " He raised his glass in salute . " It 's your fight , brother . " Phil thought it over . " O.K. , I get it . " " The Jewish part is , anyway . The rest of it 's everybody 's fight . I bet we 're in for a hell of a scrap , what 's more . " " I bet . The Jews are always just the first . " " The hell with the Jews , as Jews . " Dave hitched forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's the whole thing , not the poor , poor Jews . " He waved toward the windows , as if he were waving to the whole stretch of country beyond . Involuntarily , Phil looked outside . The last daylight was still there , wan , impotent against the encroaching dark . Dave 's voice went on , somber now . " The price for antisemitismis so damn big , Phil . And there 's always a price for it . " A current of affection shot through Phil . Dave 's face had gone hard ; there was neither unease nor concession in it . He was staring into his drink as though there were a speck in it . " You mean price reckoned in constitutions and preambles , things like that ? " " You know damn well what I mean . Do n't force me to make with the big words . " Dave shrugged , amiable again . " Anyway , let 's hear the rest of it , for Pete 's sake . You still hunting for the angle ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him what he 'd been up to . " I 've been doing it , " he ended , " for about two weeks . " Dave did n't say anything . Phil waited . Dave carefully set his glass down and reached into his pocket for a ciga-9rette . Then he remembered they were on the table near him . He got one out and lit it . He inhaled deeply and blew smoke out hard . Then he looked directly at Phil . " Why , you crazy bastard , " Dave said slowly . " You goddamcrazy bastard . " Phil suddenly remembered the three of them in the pup tent in the woods near the house . The daylight all but gone , fierce rain battering the canvas . Through the open triangle the streaming pepper trees were as black green as sycamore and eucalyptus . " They 'd be thoroughly scolded when they got home , they knew , but the chilling excitement of the game held them there . Nine , maybe ten , they 'd been . Their wooden rifles were at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There , " Petcy had whispered hoarsely , " behind the trees . Lions and the jagers and the big cats . See ? " " Ready , men ? " That was Dave . " Ready , sir . " Petey and he together. 1 ) a ) c 's voice went majestic . " I , et than have it . The jungle holds no terrors for Cecil Rhodes and his gallant band . " The delicious feeling of unity , friendship , safety together  --  w hatever it was then , suddenly it stood warm and fresh again in him . I he looked across to Dave 's chair . " Crazy bastard yourself . " Would she call hirn ? Was she waiting for him to call her ? Off and on all afternoon , the question mark had curled its separate existence in his mind . When Dave finally went for his shave and shower , Phil dialed her number . There was no answer . Suddenly he knew that through all the hours , using Dave 's presence for a screen , he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he 'd been alone , he 'd have watched each hour134of silence as a new semaphore of warning . He 'd have faced the truth : that she , too , must have been charged with unspokenthoughts , stifled challenges . Dismay must stand thick in her heart , too . Perhaps he 'd dialed the wrong number . Sometimes you got balled up on the simplest mechanical things . He lifted the receiver again . Extreme care went into the operation this time , as if he were Tom adventuring with the delightful fact that if you did thus and so you could really pick Jimmy Kelly 's house out of all the houses in New York . Not until the dial clicked hard against the metal stop each time did Phil release it and regard that step as successful . Then he waited . He counted the rings up to seven . There was no answer . Just before he and Dave left for dinner , he said , " Oh , I 'd better call Kathy . " Dave waited . Phil whistled a phrase of music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a concertthan for the theater , " he said , and hung up . " Thought she might join the celebration about your being home , " he added heartily . " Guess she 's out to a movie or something . " They went to a restaurant in the East Fifties which Kathy liked . As they waited for the Martinis they both ordered , they sat without talk . The tables were all filled ; waiters hurriedby with platters of charred steaks or creamy mixtures ; thick oblongs of butter were forked out to them by a smilingbus boy . When their drinks came Phil swallowed a third of his in the first go . " Want to talk about it ? " Dave asked . " Just one of those things . " Phil put his drink down and lit a cigarette . " I 'd probably be wiser staying on my own , " he said . " You lose the instinct for marriage after seven years alone . " " Nuts . " " You and Carol get off on tangents much ? " 135 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fights about the kids or money or things . I mean about ideas . " Dave started to ask something but changed his mind . From anybody else it would have been a direct question about Kathy , Phil thought , and was grateful . He stared at the tip of his cigarette . In the amber light of the room it burned greenish white , without redness . Betty and I never  --  but that was a bad business to start on , even with himself . Betty was Betty and Kathy , Kathy . Nor had he ever set up yardsticks for Betty 's thinking ; he had n't himself been moody , susceptible to shift and self-questioning then . Politicsand principles had n't even cut deeply into his existence in those days . All at once he wanted to find Kathy , apologize to her for being ratchety . And go meekly to Jane 's party and " just not bring it up " ? He ground out his cigarette . " Those are the toughest fights , " Dave said dispassionately , " the ones about ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you imagine our life ? Or suppose she 'd been an isolationist in the old days or pro-Franco ? Families break apart over ideas . In hot times like these , anyway . " " Like the Civil War . Pro-North husband and pro-South wife . " " Like anything that 's explosive inside . " The waiter put large menus before them . They ordered . " Damn it , " Phil said loudly , " let 's cut the gloom . " Asperity edged his manner as though it were all Dave 's fault . " Sure . I feel like blowing people to drinks . Know anybody to get ? " " Might try Minify . " IIe laughed . " Not what you had in mind , hey ? Trouble is  --  say , there 's Anne , I 'd forgotten her . Anne Dettrey , on the magazine , smart as hell . She 's always fun . " " Give her a ring , why do n't you ? " 136In the booth , feeling stealthy , he tried Kathy first . Then he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne 's number in the book . " Nonsense , Phil , " she said , " I 'm putting my one New Year 's resolution to its first test . " " I can imagine . " " To go to bed early  --  and alone  --  three times a week . " " You would n't want to go into a thing like that too easily ? " His spirits rose . This was just anything-for-alaughtalk , yet it seemed exceptionally important to argue her into coming . He explained about Dave and his first night back . " By golly , patriotism , " she said , and asked where they were . He watched Dave and Anne as if he were years older , remote forever from the business of flirtation and attraction . Instantly she set in motion a campaign to appeal to Dave ; instantly Dave changed , as if he 'd peeled off a layer of personality and emerged younger , cleverer , more alive . Phil felt shoved aside . Odd sensations of pride mingled with the thin stridency of jealousy in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dave ; toward Dave it was the reverse . Deftly Dave was managing to inform her that he was a married man with two kids even while he announced that he 'd be wanting to catch up on theaters and night clubs while he stayed on in town . She knew he did n't mean to go alone . She immediately accepted the situation and the invitations to come . They 'd have a fine lighthearted time together , Phil thought , and again envy squeaked in his heart . High spirits , carefree hours , distance from loneliness and solemnity  --  perhaps those were the great desiderataof life after all . He thought of Kathy . It 's more than just having fun . All at once he knew137she was at no movie . She 'd known he would telephone sooner or later ; she 'd wanted that unanswered ringing to assault him . She 'd meant it to bash him , teach him a lesson , bring him to terms . Women knew their weapons well . He glanced across the table . Anne and Dave were laughing about something he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their haircuts still GI , were passing the table , weaving a bit . " I do n't like oflishers , " one announced and stopped uncertainly . Dave looked up , indulgent . The long-suppressed resentment , he thought , to army brass . The young man raised his voice . " An ' shpccially if they 're yids . " Dave 's arm reached . I Iis hand had the speaker 's wrist before he 'd shoved up out of his chair . His free hand was a fist , pulling luck for leverage . Phil was up too , fury tearing tIr , u ; ; li him . And yet he had time to notice the control in Dave 's impassive face . " Sorry , sir , " the other young man cried . " He 's terrible when lie 's tanked up , sir . " He pushed angrily at his friend ; the loss of balance was too much for the uncertain legs ; the buckling body began the slow collapse the expert dancer simulates to get a laugh . Somewhere near , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arm . As the body crumpled floorward it was only his hold which checked the descent . Waiters were hurrying up ; heads were turning . Dave let go , brushing his fingers off against each other as if they were fouled . Anne urgently said , " Please , Phil , Dave . " They sat down . Anne muttered , " Horrible little fool , " and Phil thought , You 're mad , sure , but you 're out of it . Then it was as if his whole mind gulped . My God , I forgot again . Around them talk burst forth while a waiter and the mortified friend struggled to lift the drunk . Heads were138averted as if near them on the carpet were a sour pool of vomit . Limp as a hammock the drunk was carried off . Anne asked for another drink . Phil looked over to Dave ; their eyes met . Dave 's were hard , but his mouth bore a sardonic twist . " Take it easy , boy , " Dave said . " Let 's do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is n't just antisemitism ; it 's battle fatigue , too . " Dave laughed , and Phil said , " I told you , " with a gesture toward her as of the producer of a hit show toward its star . Like a spitting rain , it was over . The new drinks came ; their talk moved on to other things . Secretly , though , a core of rage burned inside Phil . There was that sudden need to crack your fist into bone when it happened ; only that sagging , falling body had stopped Dave . You could n't punch an unconscious man . You had it and you were left brutish when you were balked . He 'd read the story about Rankin in Congress ; he 'd had it ; he 'd punched no jaws , yelled at no applauding House . Always there were reasons ; only rarely was the circumstance so arranged that you could fight back . The rest was this pouring of your adrenalin and this futile dammed-up fury . He knew . Now he knew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate and exact . It was n't Dave alone who 'd been called " yid . " Anne was the outsider and onlooker , but not he . Once it would have been he as well as Anne . Not now . Not ever again . Identification . Dear God , yes . " Do n't be grim any more , " she said suddenly . " Who , me ? " He glanced at her and then again at Dave . Composed and indifferent he looked , but his pulse jumped like a nerve at the side of his throat , just above his collar . The antisemiteoffered the effrontery  --  and then the world was ready139with harsh yardsticks to measure the self-control and dignity with which you met it . You were insensitive or too sensitive ; you were too timid or too bellicose ; they gave you at once the wound and the burden of proper behavior toward it . " I was thinking we might go somewhere where there 's music , " he said to Anne . " Not for a while , " Dave said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward so that she addressed both of them impartially . " Tell me why , " she said plaintively , " every man who seems attractive these days is either married or "  --  she looked at Phil  --  " barred on a technicality ? " Her woebegone look and exaggerated sigh made them all laugh . Dave patted her hand . " Your timing is lousy , " he said , " hut your instincts are just great . " After an hour they did go on to a night club and later to another . They took turns dancing with Anne ; they all laughed a good deal at their own wit . After they 'd taken her home , Phil said , " Coffee ? " and knew Dave would agree before he could nod . There was something about wanting to stay on together even though they talked of nothing that mattered . In the I'liird Avenue all-nighter , brilliant with white tile and hundred-watt bulbs , noisy with taxi drivers ' talk and dance music from Hollywood , they hardly bothered with each other , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicory-flavored coffee . The night blurred by . Somewhere there was sleep in it , and then Phil was awake and at once in a sharp hurry to get to the office . He would telephone front there . In his bedroom , Dave was sleeping so deeply that Phil dressed without fear of waking him . He would call Kathy without belligerence , without apology . But he would n't be able to back down either . Miss Wales greeted him . " Mr. Minify 'd like you in there , Mr. Green . It 's some sort of meeting . They 've alreadystarted. " 140The personnel manager , Jordan , was there , and Mary Cresson with her dictation book open on her knee . John looked formal , aloof . The round of " Morning 's " was withoutfriendliness . " I 've asked Mr. Green in , " Minify said to Jordan , " because he might pick up some detail for his series . You know what he 's working on ? " " Yes , " Jordan said . " But , Mr. Minify , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a person is . " " It 's what 's done or what 's not done I 'm interested in . " He gestured toward Phil without looking at him . " Mr. Green would do well to devote a page or so of his series to me for never thinking to check down the line in my own outfit . " " If Mr. Green had come right to me Minify turned so sharply in his swivel chair , Jordan stopped . " My niece told me about Miss Wales , " he said coldly , " so do n't imply that Mr. Green did . She brought it up just to twit me . For a minute I did n't even catch  --  then it hit . " " But I told Mr. Minify 's niece , " Phil said . He stared with hostile eyes at Jordan . " You think that if a bright kid like Wales has to change her name to get a job , nobody should talk up about it ? " Jordan looked back , conciliatory , awkward . But he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouldersrose a fraction of an inch . " Of course you 'd talk up , " the gesture spoke in Phil 's mind . Instantly he doubted his reading of it . He glanced at John Minify and knew he 'd caught the same thing . The lightness of Minify 's eyes above the dark sockets was startling as he looked directly at Jordan . His face looked older . He sat erect and imperative before them . Then he picked up a pencil and began to write on a memo ' 4 ' pad as if he 'd forgotten they were there . He wrote several words rapidly , read them , changed them , and then turned the pad face down and went on as if there 'd been no span of silence . " Big talk comes easy , Jordan , and my editorials , too . I 've been a fool to assume they 'd mean what they say in my own office . Now I 'll see they do . " " But really , Mr. Minify , I 've never made it a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well , personality . " He brightened . " If a girl 's personality is the type that fits in , I 'd never ask , , " It 's just by chance , you mean , that we have n't one secretarynamed Finkelstein or Cohen ? In the city of New York ? " I lis voice was soft . " Come off it , Jordan . " Phil looked over curiously . Jordan was a man you 'd never notice if there were other people about . Medium tall , medium coolor , neat as to clothes , haircut ; even the wrinkles about his eyes seemed neatly rayed out in even , definite lengths . Now his face wore tension and fear . He was expecting to he tired . And he 'd hate Jews for it . " Marv , tike a help-wanted ad , will you ? " Minify picked up the small pad , read what he 'd written , then ignored it . " Upper case , ' I " ; PERT SECRETARY , ' and a couple lines white space . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exacting work , good pay . ' Then single line white space . Then , Religion is a matter of indifference in this office . Write full experience to Box ' Got that , Mary ? " For the first time since he 'd met her , Phil saw expression appear in her prim face . She likes this , he thought , and was surprised to find within himself an odd sense of occasion . " Better state the salary , Mr. Minify , " Mary said matterof-factly , " instead of just good pay . ' " " O.K. O.K. You fix it . Times , Trib ? " " Both . And they do n't allow white space in want ads  --  they 'll put that special line in caps , though . " " Right . " With finality he turned to Jordan . " And in case you have to fire Miss Wales on any ground whatever at any time , please remember that I wish to review the case myself first . " The neat mouth opened , relief shone in the eyes . Minify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gavel . Jordan went out . " Think I should fire him , Mary ? " " I do n't know . I thought you were going to . " " I argued it out with myself for a long time . " He looked at Phil . " Confusing , is n't it ? " Phil said nothing . He knew Minify was n't expecting an answer . " But till I do decide , he 's not to interview applicants any more , that 's sure . " He stroked his tan scalp as if he were smoothing down ruffled hair . " Mary , you too busy to take on some personnel management ? " " No , Mr. Minify . " " That 's the tone that means you 're dead from overwork . " They all laughed . " Tell you what . This ad . Get yourself a crack assistant for your regular stuff . Then take over on all new office help . I 'll tell Jordan . " She stood up , robust , stolid , but she flushed like a young girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Minify . " " In any other ads you run , use that line , please . " Vigorouslyhe turned to Phil . " High time heads of firms took public positions on it . " Minify watched her decorous progress across the office and through the door . Then , as if the episode had sped up his metabolism , he embarked at once on a spirited harangue with invisible opponents . Once Phil thought , IIe is n't as calm and journalistic about it all as he was a few weeks ago , and instantly added , Lord , neither am I. Minify was half142 II 143shouting at him now . "  --  the sloppy , slovenly notion that everybody 's busy with bigger things . There just is n't anythingbigger , as an issue , than beating down the complacence of essentially decent people about prejudice . Not what Stalin 's up to , not the bomb or the peace . Because if hatred and bigotry just go on rotting the basis of this damn country "  --  he glared at Phil  --  " all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clamped it into the corner of his mouth as if it were a cigar . " How 's your stuff coming now , Phil ? " While he listened , the cigarette angled upwards , and above it he squinted one eye against the flaring smoke . It gave him the lonk of a man persistently winking . When the square box on his desk hoarsely announced a caller , Phil was reluctant to quit this lively office for his own . In the corridor , his way was blocked by Frank Tingler , the fiction editor , the small neat figure of Bill Jayson , and a tall man with a vaguely familiar face . " Morning , Phil , " Jayson said , and Tingler , " Hi , Green , know Rick 1 ) ohcn ? Mr. Green . " " ' I ) o. " 1 r . Dohen said , and offered his hand . " I low do , " Phil answered , and disliked him . They shook hands heartily while Tingler explained in his flat voice , " We 're running Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , yes , " Phil said . " That new illustrator McAnny found in the army " I must stop by and tell McAnny how delighted I am , " Dohen interrupted . " I lave you seen the opening spread , Mr. Green ? Really a new talent . We were just talking about it . How would you characterize it , Bill ? " He looked down at Jayson , and Jayson had to tilt his head back to meet his gaze . Fleetingly Phil hoped Jayson really did n't mind any more being so short. 144 " It 's new and it 's right , " Jayson said dryly . " And you 'll have to wait to tell McAnny . He 's out in the Middle West on a special strike layout at G. M. " Tingler looked at Phil , but the thickly ground lenses hid whatever comment his glance was designed to convey . " Sort of a combination of Varga girl and Ingrid Bergman , that first illustration of Gracia , " Dohen said , and laughed in his enthusiasm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to catch in writing , but when I saw that first oil . Tell that boy Herman I 'm  --  fact , I 'd really like to tell him personally . " He looked down to Jayson again . " Fix it up , Bill ? " " I 'll do that . " There was no promise in his voice . " Well , I 'll be getting back . So long . " Phil moved off with him . Jayson did n't like Dohen , and Tingler was bored with him . This distinguished-looking Richard Dohen , Phil knew , was one of the highest-paid serial writers in the magazine world . " What 's the new one about ? " he asked Jayson . " Well , the gimmick is this gorgeous dame is sitting there exactly ten years from the night her husband walked out to marry the second wife . Sudden impulse . She Hell , do n't bother me , Phil . " Phil grinned . But they were nearing his office , and all at once nothing mattered but Kathy . Embarrassment plucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephoneher as soon as he 'd waked yesterday , gone to her , straightened this out . Dave would have waited for him without resentment . There was a note propped against his telephone . Miss Lacey called . E. TV . Underneath it the line , Again at zz : zo . Please call her . Without sitting down he dialed the number. 145CHAPTER NINEI 'LL TRY AGAIN AT NOON , Kathy was thinking . She moved away from the bedside table so that the phone would not persuade her into a third attempt . He 'd ring back the moment he could . This was no crisis to justify asking Miss Wales to put the call through to him in the meeting . She went firmly into the bathroom and weighed herself as if that had been her intention for many minutes . In a way it was a crisis . She 'd known it when he left her ; she 'd known it when she 'd fallen asleep ; she 'd known it all day yesterday when instinct cautioned her from telephoning him and telling him what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolving tape of the scale . Two pounds off . Worry it off ; toss it off in your chivied sleep ; eat it off from the heart . What made her go all skewered on this damn business when they talked about it , when they were not apart on it at all , in theory or in fact ? There was something mysterious in the process of quarreling . You said one wrong thing and then tried to justify it and said a further thing . That in turn needed explaining or defense . All the time you helplessly knew that if you could only step off the treadmill of dissension and start anew  --  but something held you where you were with demoniacpersistence . Then it was too late . Emotions came in ; his face showed disapproval and surprise ; anger spat in you that he should misread your motives . Or pride reared up , and you 'd be damned if you 'd risk seeming abject and always at fault . The sense of crisis deepened , and your helplessness with it. 146With Jane and Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'd been unequivocal , incisive . But he had n't been there to hear . " You 're saying in effect , " she 'd said , " that it 'd be nice if he just would n't embarrass any Jew haters you might have at the party . " It was nice to remember that sentence . Why had she reserved such clarity for Jane and Harry when it was Phil she cared about ? With a start she saw she was still on the scale , staring down at it malevolently as if it were an insect she was steeling herself to squash . She went back to the bedroom . She was tired ; her back was tired ; her neck was tired . She wished he would get out of the meeting and call her . She glanced at her watch . Less than ten minutes had passed since her second try . With Bill , when things went wrong , she 'd never felt this dull ache or fear or whatever it was . There 'd been a kind of remoteness instead . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue they disagreed on . Twice now with Phil she 'd known she was somehow in the wrong . She should resent him for making her feel so ; that was supposed to be human nature . But it did n't work that way . She just hurt . This frightened wonder about losing him was what hurt . The drive to Darien had soothed her . She felt purposeful and clearheaded . But the string of cars parked in front of the snowy stretch of ground before the house warned her that her neat plan would not work . She 'd forgotten the usual comings and goings of the suburban world on New Year 's afternoon . Inside , she knew there 'd be no chance for a serious talk until much later . And as each couple arrived with some variation of hair-of-the-dog remarks , each with the satisfied look of one who coins a bright new witticism , she found herself exasperated and bored. 147Bill 's " What 's he like ? " had sent her on and on about Phil . But that one thing she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I get so mixed up . " In the pleasant empty cottage , she said it half aloud . How could she , of all people , get so confused on these things ? She 'd been so clear always , she and all the other people she knew , like Jane and Uncle John and everybody else . They 'd not think about things like antisemitism often , but when it did come up , there was n't any question that they loathed it and wanted to do something to stop it from growing . And yet now she was in the middle of a different place , where the thing became a personal thing  --  now everythingshe did or said was fuzzy . Twice in so short a time things had gone awry between them . And both times she 'd had that dull pull of fear . The checkrein again , tighter . Now , remembering the cottage , and unconscious of the gesture , Kathy moved her head down and up and around in a swiveling motion . She sighed and reached for something to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snatched the arm back as if it had touched hot metal . Then she took up the receiver . " Kathy ? " " Oh , Phil , I wanted to call you last night , but it was midnight when I got back and " Got back ? Where from ? " " Jane 's . I went up to have it out with her . Oh , darling , has this been hell for you , too ? " " I have n't exactly liked it . " His voice was stiff . " You mean you told her you could n't persuade me ? " " Oh , no . I found myself saying all the things you would have . Jane said , Well , goodness , O.K. , ' as if she had n't asked it and started this awful business . " She swallowed. 149 " Darling , I just heard the news . You 're getting married again . Who is he ? What 's he like ? When do we meet him ? " Endlessly the questions had come . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's a writer . Phil Green . No , he writes as Schuyler Green . That 's right . Smith 's mostly for the last couple of years . Oh , thank you , I think he 's pretty bright myself . Only when she 'd got off alone did she even ask herself whether Phil would have expected her to say anything else . Suddenly she 'd flimsily announced that she 'd " forgotten to check up on things at the house " and had gone off in desperationto the cottage which needed no checking at all . Unlocking the door , seeing the pleasant rooms as if she were Phil seeing them for the first time , the wide windows that would stream with yellow sunshine on a prettier day , the books and magazines left on end tables as if the place were really lived in  --  all of it had sent her off into happy planning of spring week ends there with him , and later the whole summer for all of them . And then the question , and with it the doubt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected her to say anything else . It would be imbecilic to say , " He 's a writer , he 's Jewish , " " Ilk name is Phil Green , he 's Jewish , " " He writes as Schuyler Green , he 's Jewish . " That would be a sort of inverted proof that it did matter to her  --  or would if it were true . If Phil were n't doing this thing , would it ever occur to her to mention his religion , or his agnosticism , which was much more interesting ? " He 's a writer , he 's Episcopalian , " " His name is Phil Green , he 's an agnostic . " Surely it would be equally clumsy and absurd to say the other . Was that the only reason she had n't once mentioned it ? And when she 'd told Bill Pawling about getting married , 148 " Darling , do n't let 's do this any more  --  we feel the same underneath . Could n't we have lunch and talk ? " There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing . He sat down . He hauled back his runaway feelings as if they were lively dogs on a leash . Suddenly he seemed unable to evaluate , even to remember clearly , the nuances that had seemed so tremendous . A hair-splitting nicety endowed them now , nothing more . " But why the disappearing act ? " He could n't help the tone of resentment . " I phoned you all evening and got pretty beat up about all the silence . " " I just could n't phone till after I 'd fixed everything . I drove out the minute I got up , but the place was full of people and I could n't get them alone till awfully late . " She was hurrying explanations the way Tom sometimes did , so earnest in admission that it became incumbent on him to nuke it easier , to end it . Damn the inquisitor 's role he was always falling into . " Solemn " was a kind way to describe this testy stuffiness of his . He was being a purist , a fool  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It rear hell , darling , " he said . " I warned you I could be a solemn ass . If you love somebody , though Hold it a second . " 1liss Wales had opened the door . " Captain ( ioldmnan 's on my line , Mr. Green , " she said . " Could you lunch with him ? " He raised a forefinger to her and spoke again to Kathy . " Dave 's here ; he got in yesterday . He 's calling in about lunch . Should we  --  no , we 'd better talk this out first . " " Maybe it 's good not to hash it over any more for a while , Phil . " A brighter inflection warmed her voice . " Let 's do have Dave . I 'm dying to meet him . " He came back to the office in a bouncing energy . He went 150 straight to the typewriter and began at once to " write forward " as he called it , instead of first rewriting parts of the last page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hours there was almost no break in the clack and clatter of the old-timer they 'd given him . The needed word leaped forth , the sentences turned and shaped and smoothed on the lathe of his mind so quickly that his speeding middle fingers on the keys were like a secretary struggling to keep up with too-rapid dictation . He lit a cigarette and stretched back . Then he saw another cigarette , freshly lighted also , tipped against the edge of the loaded ash tray . He smiled . It was another sign . When you wrote in this fierce concentration you did n't know where you were , did n't remember the gesture of a moment before , did n't know what time was elapsing . You felt whole and good and damn lucky to be a writer . You could n't believe you 'd ever again be caught in the sticky , faltering uncertainty , the fretfulness of doubt over progress , the ambivalence about the choice of a word , the point of attack , the transition to the next point . You were master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no man anywhere could contrive a life you would prefer to your own . The door opened . He winked at Miss Wales and pointed to the sheets spread on the desk . He knew what she would say and wanted to forestall it . " Nope , not ready for you yet . " He 'd explained at the beginning that he would not be turning over each day 's rough draft for her professional typing , that indeed she 'd not get any of it until the series was virtually complete . For a week she had accepted this odd ukase without remonstrance . Then she began to give daily signs that secretarial protocol was being outraged . Each time she saw new pages of manuscript , her itch to take charge of them became more151apparent . She wanted to take those untidy pages and turn them into unmarred manuscript . Phil sympathized . But even if he were to turn over his draft without the title , the first sentences of the first paragraph of the first article would effectively end his role with her . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father and an Episcopal mother , whose parents on both sides before them had been Episcopalians . But for the last eight weeks No , she could n't see even that much for a while . While he was thinking , he automatically gathered the strewn sheets , slapped their edges against the desk , folded them in thirds , and stuck the thin wad into his pocket . He would take this new batch home , to join all the other pages . Not that he would n't trust Miss Wales with his life , his cash , or sacred honor . But he would not trust her to enter the office when he was not there and resist even one quick glance at the top page . For in her place , he himself would certainlyargue that anything to be published for three million readers need scarcely be treated as a secret . " I was n't even going to suggest it , Mr. Green , " she said . " If you like to work that way , it 's all right . " " lIust seem like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you something about Jordan . " IIc looked up , interested . " Let me just get these notes together . Only take a minute . " Nothing Wales could say about Jordan could disturb this good feeling of satisfaction , of virtue in the old Latin sense . The meeting of Dave and Kathy had added fillip to his own joy at feeling close with her again . Never in any later stage of love could reconciliation seem so pervasive ; as if each separate cell of body and brain knew harmony again . They 'd had only the taxi ride to the restaurant alone , but that quick time had given her back to him . " Oh , Phil , 152I never pretended to be as clearheaded and strong about things as you . " Between her and Dave , there 'd been at once an easy , quick affection . She 'd offered to help him search for the six-room apartment he 'd need , and they 'd all laughed when Dave wryly said , " One good thing about the housing shortage , Phil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Over their coffee she 'd impulsively said , " Come on up on Saturday , Dave , to this party my sister 's giving Phil and me . " She 'd been perfectly uncomplicated about it . So different , he 'd thought , when your own life is n't involved , and chided his mind the next instant . " Meet-the-family party ? " Dave had grinned . " Not me . But thanks , anyway . " A polite cough brought him back to the present . Miss Wales said , " Go right ahead , Mr. Green , " and looked at the notes already folded neatly before him . " Sorry , I got thinking about something . What about Jordan ? " " Well , he 's telling everybody about Mr. Minify 's ad and he thinks it 's a wonderful thing . He 's saying . " " Quick as that ? " He snapped his fingers . Knuckling little hypocrite . " I 'd thought I 'd ask you if it 's true the ad says right out that " " Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You mean practically inviting any type to apply ? " " Any type ? What are you driving at ? " " Oh , Mr. Green , you do n't want things different around here either , do you ? Even though you 're an editor and it 's different with editors ? " Finally it got through the sheath of his own good spirits that under her usual manner was something new. 153 " Different for editors how ? " She hesitated . She looked away . " Well , I just mean . If they just get one wrong one in , it 'll come out of us . " Her voice edged into stridency . " Do n't you hate being the fall guy for the kikey ones ? " Kin to no reaction he 'd ever had before , a tiny geyser seemed to shoot upward and spray out within his viscera . An image flashed into his mind of a minuscule Old Faithful . When he spoke , he did so with extreme care . " We 've got to be frank with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to know right off that words like kike and kikey and yid and coon and nigger just make me kind of sick , no matter who says than . " " Why , I just said it for a type . You know the kind of person . " She was clearly astonished at being picked up on it . " We 're talking about a word , first . " " Ilut that 's nothing . Why , sometimes I even say it to myself  --  aboutme , I mean . Like , if I 'm about to do something and I know I should n't , sort of in my head I 'll say , Oh , do n't he such a kike . ' " The minute geyser rose in stature , crowding his solar plexus . She was not improvising ; this was truth she was tellinghim . As if the matter were disposed of , she went on , " Just one of the objectionable ones in here and He said , " Just a minute . " She stopped . It had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He leaned over his desk , picked up a pencil as though he were about to write . She waited , and this time he felt no compunction about letting her wait . What made her do it ? He had to know something of the answer , guess at it , find it , before he could go on speaking . Did she have so deep a hatred and fear of the word that she needed to fob it off as a light jest to exorcise it ? Was it an154unconscious need to beat the insulter at his own game by applyingthe epithet to oneself first ? " This is nothing ; this is n't a word that can hurt me . " The man who cries out to the wife he has betrayed , " I know I 'm a weakling , a bounder , a cad , anything you want , " in the need to make himself immune from the words she would otherwise hurl  --  was n't she doing the same thing ? Or did her impulse spring from an unconscious longing , hidden and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to call Jews kikes ? He put down the pencil and turned back to her . " What do you mean by ' objectionable ' ? " He was proud that no irritation sounded in his words . " You know , loud , and too much rouge and all . " " They do n't hire any girls that are loud and vulgar . What makes you think they 'll suddenly start ? " " Well , it is n't only that . " She suddenly turned on him with spirit . " You 're just sort of heckling me , Mr. Green . You know the kind that just starts trouble in a place like this and the kind that does n't , like you or me , so what 's the sense of pinning me down ? " " You mean because we do n't look especially Jewish . " " Well " She smiled confidently . That was it , then . They were O.K. Jews ; they were " white " Jews ; with them about , the issue could lie mousy and quiet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I hate antisemitism and I guess I 'd better tell you I hate it just as much when it comes from you as from anybody else . " " Me ? Anti  --  why , Mr. Green I " She stood up , did nothing whatever for a space of seconds , and then walked with completedignity from the room . Bert McAnny was in an expansive mood . He 'd been in Detroit for only two days , and already his assignment was155well wound up . The press photographer Jayson frequently used on free-lance assignments in the Middle West had proved responsive to his direction and ideas , and there 'd be enough good shots for ten articles instead of one . The secondbatch of enlargements should be done by evening , and he could start East at once . Everybody had been friendly and helpful , whatever side they took on the strike . That was because Smith 's was so big . This man across the luncheon table had made himself an old friend in two days . Jefferson Brown was public-relations counsel for one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike , but he 'd given Bert McAnny much time and help with collateral pictures for background and fill-ins . Bert liked him . " Want to sec some shots , Jeff ? " he asked . " All I 've got are I , cica-size glossies , though . " He reached into his pocket . " I 'm no good with them while they 're just postage stamps . " But Jeff Brown took the envelope and went through the pictures . " You sure slant the whole damn thing for the strikers , " he grumbled when he returned them . " Orders ? " " I told you I was pro-labor . " McAnny shrugged . " You go after stuff you feel sympathetic to . " " You going to print those nigger ones ? " " If they fit the story that 's turned in . Why not ? " " Stir up  --  ( ; od , you people that do n't have to live with it the way we do 1 " McAnny sat there looking superior . Jeff Brown thought , Righteous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FEPC . They were all Jew lovers , coon lovers , Roosevelt lovers . Communists . " It 's plenty stirred up without any help from Smith 's , " McAnny said . " You guys in New York ought to wake up . Why , out 156here , between the Jews and the coons , we 're " He stopped at the look McAnny gave him . " Skip it . " " You 'll be telling me next that Bilbo and Rankin are great fellows , " Bert said . A combative look came into Jeff Brown 's face , and Bert abandoned sarcasm for persuasion . " There 's no sense us fighting , Jeff . We 've had a swell time for two days , and it 's a free country . " " Until they take over the rest of it . " Brown raised a forkfor emphasis . " You know something ? Guy over at Ford told me . There 's a boycott on the radio against Christians . " " Go on , you 're kidding . " " Fact . All the networks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks all they 've carried is White Christmas just so they would n't have to play Silent Night and .4deste Fidelis and things like that . " Bert guffawed , and Jeff protested , " It 's no joke  --  it 's true . " " Come on , Jeff , you 're falling for a lot of antisemitic stuff . It gives me the creeps , hearing cockeyed talk like that . That 's nothing but witch-hunt stuff . " " They 've taken you into camp , too , hey ? " " I just do n't go for antisemitism and all that business , " McAnny said . He took a sedate sip of coffee . " At the office about four of the editors are Jews , but you could n't ask for better guys . There 's this fellow , calls himself Schuyler Green  --  you must have read some of his stuff . Well , except he 's too touchy , you 'd " Schuyler Green ? " " Know him ? " " No . I just  --  name rings a bell somewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him now . " Bert 's manner was judicious ; he would not indulge in panegyric . " Oh , sure , he 's pushy the way they all are , gets himself157asked to lunch with the boss , wo n't give Jayson a line on a series he 's doing just to make us dance around waiting . But he 's really O.K. " He saw that Jeff Brown was n't listening . " I knew it , " Jeff said suddenly . " That name . Vice-Presidentover at Naismith Motors is married to his sister . My wife plays bridge with her , and she brags about her famous brother , Schuyler Green . King , Belle King , probably Bella to start with  --  well , will you just imagine that ! " " Imagine what ? " " The hot shot 's wife , Dick King 's wife , being a yid . " He roared . " Is that something ! " " You mean you did n't know it ? " " Christ , a thing like that ? She 's never let on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set , clubs , all that . " " Passing , hey ? " McAnny said . IIe wrinkled his nose as at a sudden stink . " I 'd have the guts to admit it , would n't you ? " Brown shook his head , the amiable expert . " Yellow underneath , all ( if them . They 'll do it every time if they can get away with it . " IIe paused . " Bella does n't look Jewish . Does he ? " " Well " Ile thought back to Phil 's face . " There 's that , Jc  --  ish something when he smiles , around the mouth . " Suddenly , Jeff Brown slapped the table and began to laugh . " Wait'Il I lelen hears this . Oh , brother . " It had been a successful party any way you looked at it . As Phil drove off with Kathy from the music and talk and laughter behind them , he felt that an invisible imp perched on the dashboard and pointed a derisive finger at him . " Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . She had wanted to go up in her car and had insisted on his taking the wheel. 158 " Except for meeting everybody . But that 's me all over . A goddam violet . " " Nobody 'd ever guess it . They all think you 're wonder-ful . " They drove on in easy silence . It was midnight ; they were going to join Anne and Dave for a nightcap at Anne 's place . Beside him Kathy hummed the tune they had danced to in the cleared dining room . " You old smoothie , " she 'd said after their first steps together . " Why did n't you tell me you dance like this ? " His dancing was dated , and he knew it perfectly , but her praise made him feel young and smug . IIe 'd promptly tried a fancy rhythm break and muffed it . They had laughed over it , and the whole evening had gone just that way . Pleasant people , good talk , faintly lascivious remarks about the wedding license and waiting for their marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft extension and taxes , disagreement , agreement , no tensionabout anything . He had " brought it up " when they asked what he was writing , and nothing had happened . No look , no lull in the talk , no quick glance . The talk and jokes and laughter drifted on , and the pride in Kathy 's eyes exhilaratedhim as much as the sense of being liked and even lionized a little as " a real live author . " He took his eyes briefly away from the road and looked at Kathy . " Who 's that Mrs. Manning ? " he asked . " The one said she was hipped on education ? " " Ellen ? She 's got three boys and she 's been up to her cars starting a sort of Springfield Plan in the schools here . Iler husband Tom is hipped on skiing  --  drags her off to Placid every other week end . " " She told me , at least about the schools . I got on fine with her . I guess I understand people that get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked up at him . In the bluish light from the instrument panel he looked tired . But he was happy . His moods never needed to be guessed at ; he was transparent because he was without a touch of the devious . In the first minutes after they 'd arrived for dinner alone with Jane and Harry , she 'd known that everything was going to go smoothly and she was proud of him , pleased with herself for belonging to so pleasant a world as Jane 's delightful house indicated . " They 'd talked about his series . Harry called it " a smart stunt " in his booming way , but she 'd warned Phil on the way up that Harry Caulton was the hearty extrovert about everything . " He was against Dewey , though , " she 'd said , and Phil had chuckled at the recommendation . " For a big corporation lawyer that is sort of bright , I'liil . " Jane had praised Smith 's for " going after this awful thing , " and by the first ring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now it was over and without mishap . Confidence and anticipation surged in her . By next Saturday they 'd be man and wife , and whatever other problemsarose would be vanquished , too . " I lc can have my apartment , " she said suddenly . " Dave . " " Yours ? " " Oi , no , I guess they just could n't squeeze in , with two children . " " It 's sweet of you , to worry so about him , darling . " She 'd gone to every broker in town with Dave for the past three days , bought the papers at midnight , and marked the addressesthat were not in " impossible neighborhoods . " He was as grateful as Dave himself . " Maybe the kids could sleep in cots in the living room for a while , anyway . We 'll ask him . " His mother 's room was to be theirs . Just yesterday , she and Kathy had discussed it with a serene practicality that left him fidgeting . About some things women were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill at ease as he himself if their first nights were to be spent right in the apartment with Tom and his mother . Not that they would be . They were going off for five days to the White Mountains . " Why 'd we ever say we 'd meet them after the theater ? " Kathy asked . " It 'll be way past one when we hit town . " " Should we phone them no soap ? " Under the casual words , the secret hammering . They 'd been out with Dave or with Dave and Anne every night for a week . " Let 's , darling . " He could scarcely hear the words . Automatically , his foot inched the accelerator nearer the floorboard . They drove on in silence . It had been a strange week ; they had never been alone enough even to " talk out " the quarrel they 'd had . " I felt pretty damn much of a fool at Jane 's , " he said . " For all the fuss I 'd kicked up beforehand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched by his apology . It felt good to offer it , so simple , so casual , the daisy impulsivelypicked from a meadow and handed over in a moment of love . " Ca n't think why she even bothered to ask , " he went on lazily , " if I 'd lay off for tonight . " She shrugged . And all at once he knew why and clamped the reason back into his throat . It had nothing to do with Kathy . It was no fault of Kathy 's . But all at once he knew what had gone on in Jane after Kathy 's straight talk on New Year 's Day . " Well , goodness , O.K. ' " She had said it and accepted the fact that " it " would come up . She had n't even considered breaking her word . She had n't given his secret away to a soul . She had merely weeded out the list of guests she 'd originallymeant to ask . She 'd left out some of the friends who161normally were part of " the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway , she 'd " cleared it " first with them to be sure there 'd be nothing awkward . That was for tonight and its special circumstance . But at her next party and the next and next , at all her parties , those very guests she 'd banished tonight would be there again , welcome in that charming house , comfortable with all those pleasant people , many of whom , like Jane , had praised him and Smith 's Weekly for " going after this awful thing . " " Say , Dad , " Tom said in a conversational tone , " are we Jewish ? " Phil looked up from the morning newspaper . " Jimmy lelly said we are . " " What 'd you tell hirn ? " " ( ; cc , I just said I did n't know and I 'd ask you . " l'liil folded the paper , creasing it lengthwise and then across as if lie were wedged in by a subway mob . But it was tune he needed , not space . He might have known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . It would be simple to say " yes " for now , but lies were n't the way out with other things . With this intangible one , a temporary yes would sow deep confusions for later on . I lc glanced once at his mother . She was waiting with the same offhand interested look the kid had . " Well , ' I'um , let 's go back a bit . " , He needed to decide , but his mind busied itself with other matters . The superintendent , Olsen ? I lad to he . Olsen to Alma Martin to somebody else on the street until it reached Jimmy Kelly 's house across the way . Three weeks ago Phil would have been unbelievingand dumfounded . Now he felt only recognition . He looked at Torn . " Remember when you said you were a bandit outlaw ? " But a better idea suddenly struck him . " Rememberthe Danny Kaye movie ? " " Sure . " 162 " And how you asked if a dead brother 's ghost could really get into his twin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like him ? " " Kathy said it was just pretending . " His eyes brightened in memory , and he began to laugh . " Well , I 'm pretending I 'm Jewish for the stuff I 'm writingnow . " " You mean it 's like a movie or a game ? " " Sort of a grown-up game . " " You mean you 're not Jewish but just as if you had a twin brother 's ghost in you , like the movie , and that one is Jew-ish ? " " Something like that . " He grinned at Tom and in a singular flare of pleasure leaned toward him and gave him a shadow-box punch to the shoulder . The kid had caught something up into a phrase for him . Tom punched back and giggled . He often took recourse in this silly giggle when something was happening which was pleasant but beyond him . Now he immediately masked his face with severity , plunged both hands deep into his pockets , and looked at his father in man-to-man deliberation . " D' you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ? " " Too ? You mean you want to get in on it yourself ? " " Can I , Dad ? What do you have to do ? " Phil did n't answer . His mind darted ahead , skimmed the possibilities that might be there for a boy of eight . He remembered the navy 's searchlights , picking over dark , ominousshores and beaches . " Look , Tom , this is n't a game a little boy would know how to play right , " he said finally . " I 'd like it if you 'd just promise not even to tell anybody it 's a game . Would you promise that ? " Tom turned serious , to match his father 's new look . He placed the backs of his hands hard against each other , lacing163his fingers stiffly . " That 's our special G2 sign for the pledge of honor . " " O.K. " For the first time , Mrs. Green spoke . " What 'll you tell Jimmy ? " Tom looked quickly from her to his father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibs are n't wrong for G2 , " he said , " even if they stick needles in you . " He shuddered deliciously . " I 'll tell him I have n't any information . " It did n't satisfy Phil , but he let it go . Tom rushed away from the table to get his books and the new stamps he 'd collected for trading at school . Mrs. Green sat very still . She looked tired again these last two or three days . He asked when she was to have her second check-up at Dr. Craigic 's and at Dr. Abrahams ' , but as she answered he was suddenly hearing Bill Jayson 's rueful " Hell of a note , is n't it ? Then they 'd think you were hiding it . " Toni clattered back on his way out . " Wait a minute , " Phil said . " I 'm not so sure that 's a good idea . " " Tom stopped . " To tell him you have n't any information . " " OIL " 1 lc looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and I said I was partly Jewish . " " O.K. But not say it 's the ghost part ! " His face brightenedagain , and he banged out of the house . " That 's better , I think , " his mother said , but Phil did n't answer . From his room came sounds which said Dave was getting up . In a way , he thought , it 's always going to be true , at that. 164CHAPTER TENCG SORT OF TRIPLE PLAY , " Anne was saying , " till he findsan apartment big enough . " She glanced at Kathy , then across to Phil , ignoring Dave as if they were three doctors in consultation and he the patient who could listen but not object . " It 's awfully bright , " Kathy said . " Certainly better than giving up this grand job he 's hooked , " Anne said , " and going back to California . " " Nuts . I would n't consider it . " The patient refused to be relegated to the passive role any longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's all . Brooklyn , the Bronx , the suburbs . " Dave 's firmness put , if not a period to the discussion , at least a semicolon , and it came to a temporary halt while they all shifted positions in their chairs , sipped their brandy or coffee , and looked appraisingly at him and each other . Behindthem , ignored by common consent , was the cluttered table they had just left . They were at Kathy 's ; it was Claudia 's day off , and the girls had got dinner together . Anne had been efficient and gay , offering some joking commentevery time she came in from the kitchen . Kathy had been quiet and so clearly happy that she sent forth to Phil an indescribable assurance that being a wife , a mother , a providerof food and comfort was her natural role . In two days they 'd be married and alone together and their life truly launched . " You wo n't find a thing anywhere , " Anne began again to Dave , " and anyway "  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a promotion from my dump . By summer you 'll find a sublease at least . " " Your place is lovely , Anne , " Kathy protested , " even with all that glamorous mob hiding the color scheme . " Lazily Phil wondered whether there really was an undercurrent of antagonism between the two or whether he imaginedit . It did n't matter . In this exchange , Kathy 's voice again wore its silken envelope as it had once or twice at Jane 's party . That no longer mattered either . For now he knew it for a clue that she was straining a bit for that air of suavity which so many people in and around New York seemed to regard as desirable . It was silly and a little insecure , but no longer did it antagonize him ; rather he felt it a touching recourse for her to have to take . Dave was again resisting Anne 's plan and he let them argue . I lied been as astonished as Dave when she 'd come out with it . It was fantastic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more so than that the housing shortage might force him to turn down the Quirich-Jones offer . In his own concern for Dave  --  the last two long-distance calls to Carol and the kids were tempered with discouragement  --  he had kept himself mute in this discussion for fear he 'd weight it to Anne 's disadvantage . Even a temporary move would be a good deal of nuisance for her . Why had she offered it ? Was she falling in love with Dave , married though he was ? " It 's you she 's really interested in , " Dave had said casually one night . " I mean if you were n't engaged . " No , her motive in this offer was surely free of anything personal . Lonely people were often the generous ones , as if they unconsciously sought ways to prove themselves needed and important . Anne was looking at Dave directly , on her face only a matter-of-factness , undecorated by sympathy or generosity . " So it 's a cinch , " she summed up . " Kathy moves in with166Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids move into my place . No cots in the living room . " " We 'll see . " Dave took her empty glass without asking her and said , " May I ? " to Kathy . " Let me , " Kathy said . " How 's yours ? " He raised a halfamberglass , and she turned to Phil , repeating the question . She looked not at his drink but at him . Her face still wore the smile she 'd just given Dave , friendly , wanting to fetch things for welcomed guests , but this private glance was a question for Phil alone . " Did they ? " His eyebrows moved up as if in a shrug , but a dart of unwillingness pricked at him again . " We 're practically arrangingan affair for them , " Kathy had said last night , " deserting them in her apartment in the middle of the night . " Her words came back , casual and even gay . There was no reproof in them , no prying for a counterremark that might consolidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in bed together ; she would not turn to the moralist 's vocabulary for terms like " adultery " any more than he . Yet the very notion had nicked reluctance into life like a touched nerve . He had pulled back sharply last night from speculation and now again he did the same thing . He gave Kathy a bland smile , waved to the piano , and said , " You would n't play that sonata for us , would you ? " Instead , she opened the phonograph and clicked a switch . A record must have been lying on the turntable , for at once the room filled with the lilting cadence of music which Phil did not know . He listened , trying to identify it , and knew the record was from some middle movement ; the first measureswere a continuation , not an opening . He said , " Mozart ? " and Kathy nodded , and came to sit near him . He looked at her and heard the music spill forth in a rippling , simple beauty . All at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confusions always , to know only this contentment trickling into the secret layers  --  so vulnerable  --  inside him . For perhaps a quarter hour there was no talk from anyone . When a record wound down to its eccentric grooves , Kathy would rise to turn it over or change it , and during the silence each of them seemed unwilling to break the serene emptiness and waiting in the room . Suddenly Anne leaned forward . She stamped her cigaretteout with an energy that was'decisive , even ill-tempered . " Let 's go somewhere and dance , " she said . " All you happy people give me the willies . " Kathy 's eyelids hooded her eyes . They do n't really like each other , Phil decided . " Wait 'll we hear this thing out ? " he asked Anne . ' Then we 'll discuss . " Anne leaned back in her chair again . But now the music was only a pleasant backdrop to his thinking . No longer was he listening to it directly , separate note after separate note , as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a vagueness , as to the sounds of summer wind and rain through the open window of a comradelyroom . Curiosity bubbled in him ; he needed to know more about I ) avc and Anne , about Anne and Kathy . He told himself that he would always need to know about people , that 's what made him a writer instead of an engineer or a businessman ; instantly he derided this as a pious attempt at promoting a gossip 's eagerness into something more respectable . Ile grinned . Kathy touched his hand and smiled also . The record was stopping again . " This is the last of it , " she said , and turned it over . " Whereabouts in the White Mountains ? " Anne asked . " Franconia Notch , " he answered . Simultaneously , Kathy said , " Flume Inn . " He was looking at Anne , stirred to a quick , sad knowledge by the revealing question she 'd asked , 168the offhand question that documented and implemented her jibe at " all you happy people . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her face blanked of expression , then took on a look he 'd never seen there . Disapproval ? Disbelief ? " Oh , you would n't , " she said vigorously . " Why not ? " he and Kathy said together . " Why , Phil , because . " She was n't looking at him . She was looking at Kathy , asking , estimating . " Phil does n't know anything about resort places here in the East , Kathy . " She said it gently , without chiding . Kathy looked back at her , then to Phil . Her single quick breath could be heard against the pianissimo measures from the phonograph . " Restricted , hey ? " Dave underlined the word with mockery . Faintly his eyes gleamed as if this were a pallid joke , not really execrable , not really funny , just familiar and worth some notice . " God damn it , " Phil said . He stood up . " Oh , no ! " Kathy cried . " I never  --  oh , Phil , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never " She looked at him with candor , with a shocked misery that she had  --  what ? Forgotten that he " was Jewish " ? " Of course you did n't think of it , " he said . " Civilized people do n't go around forever thinking , This man is Jewish , that one is n't . " She had done only what he 'd have done himself  --  been unable to translate the bald facts in his researching mail into a close and live reality . Joseph Greenberg , the researcher 's fiction , had read , from dozens of hotels and resorts , the little phrase , " indefinitely booked up , " and had dismissed each with impassive dignity , with scorn for the evasiveness of it . " Just the cliches of the thing ; people can live without these places . " But that was for a man who did not exist . Now a resort , 169one resort , was barring Phil Green  --  or would if they knew he was Jewish . " This is n't your fault , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure any more than his own . Neither of them could transform the individual they knew him to be into a man an innkeeper in the White Mountains would refuse to admit . " Are you sure ? " Kathy said to Anne . " Have you been there recently ? " " No . But I 'm sure . " " I ca n't believe " Kathy turned to Phil . " They would n't " But she thought of her golf club and beach club at Darien and broke off . Phil glanced at his watch . " Only nine . " He went into the bedroom to the telephone . She heard the three short dial swings . 2 - 1 - 1 for Long Distance . The music from the phono- graph suddenly was an offense  --  she snapped the metal button viciously . Dave leaned back and lit a cigarette . Anne reached for one . Kathy thought , She 's the only one here who does n't know Phil is n't Jewish . From the bedroom , his voice came clear and efficient . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Mr. and dirs . Philip Green of New York . " There was a pause for the flattened voice in the receiver . " One more thing , " Phil said . " Is your inn restricted ? " Kathy went into the bedroom and sat beside him on the bed . Now the metal- lic sounds became words she could hear . " Is this Mr. Green himself ? " There was caution in it . " Yes . " " Well , could I ask you why you  --  I mean , Mr. Green The voice waited , the sentence hung along the wire un- finished . " Is it or is n't it ? " Phil said . " Well , I would n't say it was restricted . ' " The voice sounded plaintive . 170 " Then it is not restricted ? " " Ah  --  may I inquire , Mr. Green , are you  --  that is , do you yourself follow the Hebrew religion , or do you just wish to make sure that Phil had a desire to shout , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice into calmness . " I 've asked a simple question ; I 'd like a simple answer . " " You see , we do have a very high-class clientele and nat-urally At his side , Kathy stirred . She put her hand on his arm . " Do n't , darling , " she whispered . " Cancel it . " " You mean you do restrict your guests to gentiles ? " " Why , I would n't say that , Mr. Green . But  --  just a moment , please . " There was the muffled thud of a receiver being laid on a table . Phil put his own hand over Kathy 's on his left arm . They sat in silence . From the other room , Dave 's voice and Anne 's came to them in indistinguishable sounds . " Hello , Mr. Green ? " " Yes ? " " There seems to be an error somewhere , Mr. Green . We have no rooms open for Sunday or the following days . " " I beg your pardon . " Phil stripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire accepting the entire reservation . " " These new clerks  --  I mean to say , well , suppose I wire you after I can straighten out this mistake with Mr. Calkins ? " " Just a minute . " The dubious voice , the hedging , the counting on proud withdrawal . Some legalism prodded Phil 's mind . " I 'm not canceling from this end , " he said . " Good night . " Immobile and silent , he sat staring at his own hand holding the receiver hard against its prongs . Obviously they would not go there , ravaging the first hours of their honey-171moon . But there was something he must do besides accepting this . He could not think what it might be . Not yet . People could live without smart clubs and resorts . Indeed they could . In a world where only yesterday human bones powdered to ash in blazing furnaces , the barred register . of a chic hotel could scarcely be called disaster . But this maddening arrogance , this automatic decision that you were not quite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kathy said in soft agitation . " It 's so lovely . We wo n't even tell Jane we 're there . " " We 'll go somewhere . " He turned toward her . " Go in to them for a minute , Kathy ? " He looked an apology . " I 've got to think . " She stood up . " The nasty little snobs are n't worth frettingover  --  do n't be so upset , Phil . " 1 le nodded ; he wanted to respond . Her distress for him was real ; it came warm and strong . But the right answer eluded him . From the doorway , Anne spoke , and they both turned around as she came in. " 1 f Disraeli and Irving Berlin and Danny Kaye and Einsteingot up a happy skiing party , Phil , " she said harshly , " that place would send for the Northwest Nazi Police and keep them out . And all such places , too . " There was no distress in her voice . Anne did n't give one good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had used that one word , " Nazi "  --  it was the meaning of the thing that angered her . While Kathy only Cut it , Phil ordered himself . Dave had come after Anne , and all four stood there in a cluster , as if in meeting . " The thing is you ca n't fight them back , " Dave said coldly . " You can never pin them down . I heard you try to . " " Anti-bias laws , " Anne said . " Possible lawsuits . They never say it or write it . " 172 " It 's horrible , " Kathy said . " It 's Behind them the telephone rang . Phil started to it and then knew it could not be Flume Inn calling back . Kathy an- swered . " Is my father there , Kathy ? " Tommy 's voice , tense , shrill , sounded through the room . " Yes , Tom , right here . " Phil took the receiver while she was still speaking . " What 's up , kid ? This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  oh , it kept mixing up on the dial . " " Is Gram sick , Tom ? " " She  --  oh , Dad , her mouth is twisted sort of queer , and she said to look in the little red book and then I could n't get the dial to Calm . The voice calm . The kid 's badly frightened . " Tom , listen . I 'll be there right away . O.K. ? " " Yes , Dad . And she talks sort of thick . " " I 'm on my way this minute . Give her that bottle of medi- cine " She took some . " " Good . Five minutes and I 'll be there . " He hung up . " Stroke , " he said . " Facial paralysis , sounds like . " They were all at the front door with him . " Dave , find Dr. Craigie in the book . Stephen Craigie . Park in the Seventies . Get him down there right off , will you ? And Abrahams , Dr. J. Ephraim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kathy said , " I 'm coming with you . " The elevator clanged open its metal door , and she stepped in before him , her coat and hat in her hands . It was Sunday morning . Phil leaned his head flat against the small panel of glass so that he could see more . On the rolled clouds below , the shadow of the plane was a moving finger of gray . He fol. - 173lowed it as if it were his only orientation in this indescribable arc of space and brilliance . Since they 'd flown him back from Guadalcanal in the hospital ship , this was the first time he 'd been up . In the seconds just before they 'd swept off the runwaysome whisper of the excitement and fear he 'd known at eighteen in the first moment of feeling himself airborne had come back ; then the superstructure of years of uneventful flying had erected itself once more . But now again , gazing down and out and around him , the loneliness and conquest of flight tingled along his nerves . Yet he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Kathy who 'd suggested the postponement of their wedding , quietly , without weighing it or hesitating . Across nearly three turbulent clays and nights her words came back to him . " It is n't only that missing it would break her heart , " she 'd said . " But we 'd feel just heavyhearted while we were gone , and wrong about  --  being happy . " Of course she was right . It was n't merely the five-day absence , particularly with Dave living there . A business trip would not have needed to be canceled . " Just a week , Phil , two at the longest , Abrahams said . Postponing a wedding is n't so awful . " " Nu , I suppose it is n't . " They both felt that it was . " It 's Toro more than anything , " he 'd suddenly said . " Funny , you do n't fuss around much with your kid until something hits into him hard . But then nothing else seems to count for a while . " She 'd nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hurt her . It had leaped out . Any parent would know how he meant it , any parent whose child had clutched his arm in the stiffness of fear . Both Craigie and Abrahams had returned the next morning and corroborated their first opinions . A minute lesion in the motor-control system on the left side . She would un-174doubtedly regain normal speech , almost free of the characteristicthickening and word confusion . It was not related to the heart attack . Not directly related . It is true that at her age , the degenerativeThe memory of the phrases again irritated him . The point , the only point , was that it was the first break in the vessel that held reason and co-ordination . If you could choose , you 'd choose death in one abrupt instant instead of this inchmeal dying ; a cell here , a nerve there , a valve , a steady emptying of the veins as with Betty . He turned his mind back to Kathy . Yesterday and the day before , she 'd been at the house whenever she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But four o'clock on Saturdayhad n't been exactly good for either of them . It was right , it was necessary , and if she had n't suggested the postponementit would have been for him to do and he would have done it . Again the persistent feeling of something ominous weighted his spirits . He looked out once more . He had been flying for more than three hours ; in another twenty minutes it would be over . He would be in the hired car the air line had promised , speeding along dry-packed roads , rehearsing at last what he should do and say . The decision to turn in only one plane ticket had made itself for him on Friday . He 'd just arranged the change of date with Judge Mayhew and normally he 'd have followed through with a call to the air-line office and a wire to Flume Inn . Maybe seeing Craigie with Abrahams the second time , so affable , so agreeable  --  maybe that had signaled his mind back . Suddenly the phone call was blasting him apart again as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd play their game for them . Wiring now , even for cause , would hand them the easy way out they counted on . He 'd pulled their wire out of his pocket175  --  he 'd told the squirt he was n't canceling . He 'd taken the airplane tickets out and fingered them as if he were blind and they in Braille . And the idea had apparently jumped into him from the finger tips upward . He 'd looked over to Dave , still doing KP . The house was quiet . Mom was asleep again , and Tom at school . " I 'm going up there for a couple hours on Sunday , Dave . I 'll be back the same evening . " " You 're wasting your time . " They 'd argued , but in the end Dave had said , " Sure you have to face them once . I did it once at Monterey . " Apart from the research need to test it all the way himself as he was doing with everything else , there was this inability to acquiesce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eye and then do it ; force them out of the generalized evasion into a boxed refusal to him , one specific individual . Flume Inn must be all the inns and hotels and clubs and landlords anywhere across all the innocent horizons below him where antisemitism was part of the " rules . " " They 're more than nasty little snobs , Kathy . " In his mind he addressed her as if he were leaning forward in urgency . " They 're the enemy . Call them snobs , and you can dismiss them . See them as persistent little traitors to everythingthis country stands for and stands on , and you have to fight them . Not for the poor , poor Jews , ' but for the whole damn thing the country is Weariness overcame him ; he slumped back and closed his eyes . His own phrase , " the first break in the vessel , " came back to him and , as he so often had in the last three days , he found himself at once thinking of death . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken her second tentative step , not of Betty 's death , but simply of death and dying , of irreparable loss and desolation . A desperate longing for Kathy seized him . He wanted her near him ; he must176never lose her . As if from nightmare , he jerked his eyes open and sat upright in his chair . The plane swept through a layer of cloud . He had n't realized they 'd been losing altitude . At once the golden brilliance of the light dimmed to gray . The oblong signal at the pilot 's door went on , and Phil fastened his seat belt and put away his cigarette . In another few minutes they were on the ground at Montpelier , Vermont , and the mountains lay serene and white under a lowering winter sky . As the Ford sedan moved along the miles , he sat almost in silence . He had chucked his suitcase in the back and got in with the tall blond boy in corduroy slacks , woolen cap , and heavy navy jacket . The boy 's face had the sallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Did he hate Jews and Negroes and Catholics and foreigners ? Or only summer folk and rich people and city slickers ? Or nobodywho had n't angered or injured him ? " I 'm taking the four-o'clock back , " Phil said . " Vill you kill half an hour over a beer and come back for me ? " " You up from Boston ? " " New York . " " Just for half an hour ? " " Business trip . " " Sure , I 'll just wait outside . " " No , that wo n't be right . I want you to drive off as if I  --  well , just drop me and then come back . Better skip the beer , at that ; just drive around and be back in ten minutes , will you ? " " Whatever you say . " They were nearing the inn . Laconically , the boy played guide , but Phil scarcely listened . The Flume , the Great Stone Face , the Notch . But he saw the grand rise of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the peculiar American story of New England , the new177version of the old England , the town meetings , the small groups of protesting men , the freedom of conscience , the freedom of worship . And here now amid all this stately calmness , the corruption . The car swerved as it turned into a long crescent that was the approach to the inn . In couples or groups , ski-suited men and women made vigorous splashes of color on the whited landscape . Phil looked at them with special curiosity . Some looked charming and well mannered and intelligent ; two couples were already drunk , uproarious and vulgar . They can make it , and I ca n't , he thought . Dry and amused bitterness invaded him . The tires squeaked against the snow . As the car stopped , a smiling page boy in green opened the door for him , spotted the suitcase , and lugged it out , asking , " Skis , sir ? " Phil shook his head and nodded to the driver . The car drove off . Behind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peripheral vision told him a man was waiting in the open door , but he stood still and looked about him with interest . Sprawling , faced with half logs , smoke rising bluely at half a dozen massive stone chimneys , the inn sent off its instant message of being expensive , comfortable , and what was meant by the word " smart , " which blanketed a thousand variables . At one side , along its shallow depth , was a porch studded wit h more of the bright raw colors of mittens and scarves and caps , restless with movement as skis were scraped and rubbed and waxed . Everywhere was the smell of new snow , the stretching whiteness , the crunch of boots through the glazed top surface to the hardness below . It would have been a calm and happy place for him to bring Kathy in their first living together . Abruptly , he turned toward the front door . The man waiting there gave a pleasant half salute and called out , " How do ? " in the rising , puzzled tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpected . His face was pale , his hair thick and gray ; he was as tall as Phil , middle-yeared , not homely , not handsome . He wore grayish tweeds , with a plaid wool shirt , an island of color and im- pudence in his general indefiniteness . " How do , " Phil said . " The desk right ahead ? " " Just inside . Driving through ? " " No , I came by air . " He went past him , into a large lounge . The registration desk was at his left , and he turned to it , but his snapshot picture of the place had already given him the blazing fireplace , the deep chairs , the beams over- head . Behind the counter the tall man was gently pushing forward a leather-cornered pad with a registration card slotted into it , saying affably , " I hope it wo n't be for too many days , but with one bag and no skis " I have reservations , " Phil said , and took the pen angled toward him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath , today through Thursday . " He wrote , " Philip " Reservations ? In what name ? " There was a stiffening all over him , mouth , voice , the arms on the counter . Phil wrote , " S. Green " and his address . Then he said , " Green . My wife will get here tomorrow . " " The Mr. Green who " " Yes , " Phil said . " You 're Mr. Calkins , the owner ? " He did n't wait for the nod . He pulled out his wallet , opened it without haste , took out the telegram , laid it on the desk , and set the wallet on top of it . Absurdly , a shakiness began in his knees , but the slow-seeping juice that caused it merely deepened his steady voice . " But there 's some error , Mr. Green . There is n't one free room in the entire inn . " His eyes sent the page boy an al- most imperceptible look , but Phil saw it . It signaled " no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy understood **25;2225;TOOLONG " Nobody said it . " " You were about to say it , " Himmler said pugnaciously , glad to have this intimate enemy to argue with for the moment  --  to take his mind off the eighty Englishmen three hundred meters away . " Keep your mouth shut , " Christian said . He looked at the mortar crew . They were cold and shivering . The new one , Schoener , kept opening and closing his mouth in an ugly , trembling yawn , but they seemed ready . Christian repeated the Lieutenant 's instructions and crawled on . Making certain to raise no dust , he approached the machine-gun crew of three on the right end of the ridge . The men were ready . The waiting , through the night , with the eighty Englishmen just over the scanty ridge , had told on everyone . The vehicles , the two scout cars and the tracked carrier , were just barely hidden by the small rise . If an RAF plane on an early patrol appeared in the sky , and came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men kept peering nervously , as they had done all the previous day , too , into the clear , limitless sky , lit now by the growing light of dawn . Luckily , the sun was behind them , low and blinding . For another hour the British on the ground would have a difficult time locating them against its glare . This was the third patrol through the British lines that Hardenburghad taken them on in five weeks , and Christian was sure that the Lieutenant was volunteering again and again at Battalion Headquartersfor the job . The line here , far over on the right of the shifting front , among the waterless , roadless sand and scrub , was lightly manned . It was a succession of small posts and wandering , mingled patrols , more than anything else , not like the densely packed ground near the coast , with its precious road and water points , where there were full-dress artillery and aerial sweeps all day and night . Here , there was a sensation of uneasy stillness , a premonition of disaster hanging over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was better in the last war . The slaughter was horrible in the trenches , but everything was organized . You got your food regularly , you had a feeling that matters were arranged in some comprehensible order , the dangers came through regular and recognizable channels . In a trench , Christian thought , as he slowly approached Hardenburg , lying once more just under the crest of the ridge , peering over it through his glasses , you were not so much at the mercy of a wild glory-seeker like this one . Finally ,  |p201Christian  thought , in 196o this maniac will be in command of the German General Staff . God help the German soldier then . Christian dropped carefully to the sand beside the Lieutenant , keeping his head down under the sky-line . There was a slight , sour smell from the leaves of the desiccated brush that clung to the sharp soil of the ridge . " Everything is ready , Lieutenant , " Christian said . " Good , " said Hardenburg , without moving . Christian took off his cap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes were over the line of the ridge . The British were brewing tea . They had a dozen fires going in small tins that had been half-filled with sand , and then soaked with gasoline . The fires flared palely . The men grouped around them and waited with their enamel dixies . The white of the enamel picked up little glitters of sunshine and gave a curious impression of restless movement to the groups . They looked very small , three hundred meters away . Their trucks and cars in their desert paint looked like battered toys . There was a man on duty at the machine gun mounted on a circularbar above the cab of each truck . But aside from that , the entire scene had a kind of picnic quality , city people who had left their women at home on a Sunday to rough it for a morning . The blankets on which the men had slept still lay about the vehicles and here and there Christian could see men shaving out of half cups of water . They must have a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . There were six trucks , five open and laden with boxes of rations , and one covered . Ammunition in that one , probably . The sentries had drifted in toward the fires , still holding their rifles . How safe they must feel , Christian thought , thirty miles behind their own lines , on a routine run to the posts to the south . They had dug no holes for themselves and there was no cover anywhere , except behind the trucks . It was incredible that eighty men could move about so long and so unconcernedly under the guns of an enemy who was only waiting the move of a hand to kill them . And it was grotesque that they were shaving and making tea . Well , if it was going to be done , now was the time to do it . Christian looked at the Lieutenant . There was a slight , fixed smile on his face , and he was humming , as Himmler had said . The smile was almost a fond one , like the smile of a grown-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play-pen . But Hardenburgmade no sign . Christian settled himself in the sand , squinting to keep the men below in focus , and waited . The water boiled below and little gusts of steam spurted up into the wind . Christian saw the Tommies domestically measuring out the tea into the water , and sugar from sacks , and tinned milk . They would make a richer tea , he thought , if they knew they would n't need the rest for lunch , or dinner . He saw a man from each of the groups around the fires carry back " the cans and sacks and carefully stow them away in the trucks . One by one , the Tommies dipped into the steaming brew and came up with their cups full . Occasionally , a twist of the wind would bring the faint sound of talk or laughter , as the men sat on the ground taking their breakfast . Christian ran his tongue over his lips , watching them , envying them . He had n't had anything to eat for twelve hours and he had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post . He could almost smell the rich , heavy savor of the steam , almost taste the thick , cloudy drink . Hardenburg did n't stir . Still the smile , still the tuneless humming . What in the name of God was he waiting for ? To be discovered ? To have to fight , instead of merely killing at leisure ? To be caught by a plane ? Christian looked around him . The other men were crouched in stiff , unnatural positions , staring with worried eyes at the Lieutenant . The man on Christian 's right swallowed dryly . The sound was foolishly loud and metallic . He 's enjoying it , Christian thought , looking back once more to Hardenburg . The Army has no right to put a man like that in command of its soldiers . It 's bad enough without that . Here and there among the British around the trucks men began to fill pipes and light cigarettes . It gave an added air of contentment and security to the small tableau , and at the same time made Christian 's palate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult at this distance to observe the men very closely , but they seemed like the ordinary , run-of-the-mill type of English soldier , rather scrawny and small in their overcoats , moving about in their phlegmatic , deliberate way . Some of them finished their breakfasts and industriously scrubbed their kits with sand before moving over to the trucks and starting to roll their blankets . The men at the machine guns on the trucks swung down to get their breakfast . There were two or three minutes when the guns on all the vehicles were left unattended . Now , Christianp203thought , this is what he was waiting for . Quickly he glanced around to see that everything was in readiness . The men had not moved . They were still crouched painfully in the same positions they had taken before . Christian looked at Hardenburg . If he had noticed that the British guns were not manned he did nothing to show it . Still the same small smile , still the humming . His teeth , Christian noted , are the ugliest thing about him . Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could be sure that when he drank anything he made a lot of noise about it . And he was so pleased with himself . It stuck out all over him , as he lay there smiling behind the binoculars , knowing that every man 's eyes were straining on him , waiting for the signal that would release them from the torture of delay , knowing they hated him , were afraid of him , could not understand him . Christian blinked and looked once more , hazily now , at the British , trying to erase the image of Hardenburg 's thin , ironic face from his eyeballs . By now new sentries had slowly swung up to their positionsbehind the guns . One of them was bareheaded . He had blond hair and he was smoking a cigarette . He had opened his collar , warminghimself in the heightening sun . He looked very comfortable , lounging with the small of his back against the iron bar , his cigarette dangling from his lips , his hands lightly resting on the gun , which was pointing directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's missed that chance . Now what is he waiting for ? I should have inquired about him , Christianthought , when I had the chance . From Gretchen . What 's driving him ? What is he after ? What turned him so sour ? What is the best way to deal with him ? Come on , come on , Christian pleaded within him , as two British soldiers , both of them officers , started out from the convoy with shovels and toilet paper in their hand . Come on , give the signal . . . But Hardenburg did n't move . Christian felt himself swallowing dryly . He was cold , colder than when he had awakened and he felt his shoulders shaking in little spasms and there was nothing to do about it . His tongue filled his mouth in a puffy lump , and he could taste the sand inside his lip . He looked down at his hand , lying on the breech of his machine pistol , and he tried to move his fingers . They moved slowly and weirdly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I won'tp204be able to do it , he thought crazily . He 'll give the signal and I 'll try to lift the gun and I wo n't be able to . His eyes burned and he blinked again and again until tears came , and the eighty men below , and the trucks and the fires , all blurred into a wavering mass . This was too much . Too much . Lying here so long , watching men you were going to kill wake up , cook their breakfast , light cigarettes , go to relieve their bowels . There were fifteen or twenty men now , spread out , away from the trucks , with their trousers down . . . The soldier 's regime , in any army . . . If you did n't do it in the ten minutes after breakfast you probably would n't find time during the rest of the day . . . When you marched off to war , to the drums and the bugles and the fluttering of banners , down the clean , scrubbed streets , you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ten hours in the cold , cutting sand of a desert that not even the Arabs had ever crossed before , watching twenty Englishmen with their trousers down , squatting over sanitary little holes in the Cyrenaicandesert . Let Brandt take this picture for the Frankfurter Zeitung . He heard a curious , lilting sound next to him . He turned slowly . It was Hardenburg chuckling . Christian turned back , but he closed his eyes . It has to end , he thought , it has to end . The chuckling had to end , the British at their morning labors had to end , Lieutenant Hardenburg had to end , Africa , the sun , the wind , the war .. . Then there was the noise behind him . He opened his eyes and a moment later he saw the explosion of the mortar shell . He knew that Hardenburg had given the signal . The shell hit right on the blond boy who had been smoking and he disappeared . The truck started to burn . Shell after shell exploded among the other trucks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , raking the convoy . The little figures seemed to stagger stupidly in all directions . The men who had been squatting at their toilets were pulling at their trousers and running clumsily , tripping and falling , with their buttocks gleaming whitely against the sandy glitter of the desert . One man ran straight at the ridge , as though he did n't know where the firing was coming from . Suddenly he saw the machine guns , when he was no more than a hundred meters away . After a moment of complete , stunned immobility , he turned , holding his trousers up with one hand and tried to get away . Someone casually , as a kind of afterthought , cut him down . Hardenburg chuckled again and again , between calling out correc/tions for the mortar . Two shells hit the ammunition truck and it blew up in a wide ball of smoke . Pieces of steel whistled over their heads for a whole minute . Men were lying strewn all over the ground in front of the trucks . A Sergeant seemed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumber through the sand toward the ridge , firing wildly from the hip . Someone shot the Sergeant . He fell down and kept shooting from a sitting position until someone else shot him again . He rolled over , his head in the sand . The squad the Sergeant had led broke and started to run back , but they were all cut down before they got anywhere near the trucks . Two minutes later there was not a single shot coming from the Tommies . The smoke from the burning trucks poured back , away from the ridge , in the stiff wind . Here and there a man moved brokenly , like a squashed bug . Hardenburg stood up and held up his hand . The firing stopped . " Diestl , " he ordered , staring out at the burning trucks and the dead Englishmen , " the machine guns will continue firing . " Christian stood beside him . " What was that , Sir ? " he asked dully . " The machine guns will continue firing . " Christian looked down at the wrecked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the trucks , there was no movement visible . " Yes , Sir , " Christian said . " Rake the entire area , " Hardenburg said . " We 're going down there in two minutes . I do n't want anything left alive there . Understood ? " " Yes , Sir , " Christian said . He went over first to the machine gun on the right , and then to the other one and said , " Keep firing , until you are ordered to stop . " The men at the guns gave him a strange , sidelong glance , then shrugged and went to work . In the silence , with not a word being spoken and no shouts or other gunfire to blend with it , the noise of the guns , nervous and irritable , seemed disturbing and out of place . One by one the men who were not handling the guns stood up on the crest of the ridge , watching the bullets skip along the ground , tear at the already dead and the wounded near the trucks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A British soldier lying near one of the breakfast fires was hit . He sat up and threw his head back and screamed . The sound floated up to the ridge , surprising and personal in the methddical rhythm of the guns . The men at the guns stopped firing as the Tommy screamed , his head back , his hands waving blindly in front of him.  | " Continue firing ! " Hardenburg said sharply . The guns took up again and the Tommy was hit by both of them . He fell back , his last scream sliced in half by a spurt of bullets in his throat . The men watched silently , the same look of fascination and horror on all the faces . Only Hardenburg did n't look like that . His lips were curled , his teeth showing , his breath came in rather hurried , uneven gasps , his eyes were half-closed . Christian tried to remember where he had seen that look before . . . abandoned , lost in pleasure . Then he remembered . Gretchen . When he had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Christian thought , they really look tremendously alike .. . The guns went on and on , the even , chattering noise by now almost like the everyday sound of a factory in the next block . Two of the men on the ridge took out cigarettes and lit them , very matter-offactly , already a little bored with the monotony of the scene . The life of the soldier , Christian thought , looking at the twitching bodies below . If they had stayed home in England it would n't have happened to them . Tomorrow it might be himself lying on the sand and some Cockney from the East Side of London putting a pound of lead into him . He felt a sudden wave of superiority . You felt superior to the Poles and the Czechs and the Russians and the Italians , but most of all you felt superior to the dead . He remembered the handsome , languid young Englishmen who used to come to Austria for the skiing , talking in the cafes in that flat , loud tone that drowned out all other speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were represented today among the officers lying fade down in the bloody sand with belly torn and buttocks showing . Hardenburg waved his hand . " Cease firing , " he said . The guns stopped . The gunner nearest Christian was sweating . He sighed loudly and wiped his face and leaned wearily on the barrel in the quiet . " Diestl , " said Hardenburg . " Yes , Sir . " " I want five men . And you . " Hardenburg started down , sliding a little in the heavy sand , toward the still field below . Christian motioned to the five men nearest him and they followed the Lieutenant . Hardenburg walked deliberately , as though he were going to addressa parade , toward the trucks . His pistol was in its holster and hisp207hands swung in stiff little arcs at his side . Christian and the others followed just behind him . They came to the Englishman who had foolishly run toward them , holding onto his belt . The Englishman had been hit several times in the chest . His ribs were shattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rags of his jacket , but he was still alive . He looked up quietly from the sand . Hardenburg took out his pistol , pulled the bolt to load it , and casuallyshot twice , without taking careful aim , at the Englishman 's head . The Englishman 's face disappeared . He grunted once . Hardenburg put the pistol back in his holster and strolled on . Next there was a group of six men . They all seemed to be dead , but Hardenburg said , " Make sure , " and Christian fired some shots into them mechanically . He felt nothing . They reached the line of breakfast fires . Christian observed the careful way in which the tins had been punched with holes to get the best possible results out of the makeshift stoves . God knows how many gallons of tea had been brewed there . There was a heavy smell of tea , and the smell of burned wool and burning rubber , and the smell of roasted flesh from the trucks , where several men had been caught in the fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ablaze . He was lying on one elbow , with his blackened and burnt head up in an alert , searching pose . The mortars had hit around here , too , and there were a pair of naked legs torn off at the hips and exploded out of their trousers , mixed with tea and canned corned beef and spilt sugar . One man had had his head almost severed from his body and he was sitting against a wheel . Christian stared at the lolling head . The face was one of a working man , with strong muscular jaws and that expression of sly stubbornness and surface servility that was so commonon British faces . The man had had an upper plate and it was half-hanging out of his mouth , giving a mocking twist to his lips . He was clean-shaven , the jaws red and scraped under the graying hair of his temples . One of the shavers , Christian thought . The neat soldier . One like that in all squads . He need n't have bothered this morning . Here and there an arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailspread out , and the shots came from all over the area . Hardenburgwent to the lead car , which had obviously been used by the officer in command of the convoy , and rummaged around inside for papers . He took some maps and some typewritten orders and ap208photograph of a blonde woman with two children that was tucked in the mapcase . Then he set fire to the car . He and Christian stood watching the car burn . " We were lucky , " Hardenburg said . " They stopped in just the right place . " He grinned . Christian grinned too . This was n't like the half-farcical approach to Paris . This was n't the black-marketing and police-work of Rennes . This was what they were here for , this is what the war was like , these dead around him were measurable , substantial , valuable . The Americans were not going to help these Englishmen very much . " All right , " Hardenburg called to the others . " Any you 've missed can walk home . Back up the hill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ridge were outlined against the sky , standing there , watching them . Flow vulnerable they looked , Christian thought anxiously , how lonely , how much he needed them .. . They passed the officer lying with his naked buttocks sticking up into the air . The flesh was slender and pale and had a look of surprisedaristocracy . Hardenburg grinned . " Do you remember , " Hardenburg asked , " what he looked like , squatting there , worrying about being constipated , when he heard the first shot ? And how he looked when he tried to run ? Trying to wave and hold up his pants at the same time ... A Captain in His Majesty 's Forces ... I 'll bet they never taught him how to handle a situation like that at Sandhurst ! " Hardenburg laughed . As he laughed , the humor of the recollection struck him more and more forcibly . Finally he had to stop walking and stood still , bent over , his hands on his knees , gasping weakly , his laughter rolling wildly out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first he did n't want to . But then the laughter caught him in its tide , and he rocked helplesslyas it swept him . The others , seeing their Lieutenant and Sergeantovercome by laughter , began to laugh , too . First they giggled , then the infection became too strong , and finally all of them , the five men with Christian and Hardenburg , and the men standing next to the guns on the ridge , were roaring together , the sound sweeping over the torn ground , the quiet bodies , the subsiding breakfast fires , the scattered guns , the comic shovels , the burning trucks , the dead man sitting propped up against the wheel , with his head almost off at the ear and the false upper plate dangling from his twisted lips.  |p209THE  TRAIN RATTLED slowly along between the drifts and the white hills of Vermont . Noah sat at the frosted window , with his overcoat on , shivering because the heating system of the car had broken down . He stared out at the slowly changing , forbidding scenery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been able to get a berth because the train was crowded , and he felt grimy and stiff . The water had frozen in the men 's room and he had n't been able to shave . He rubbed the stubble on his cheek and knew that it was black and ugly and that his eyes were rimmed with bloodshot red and that there were smoke smudges on his collar . This is a hell of a way , he thought , to present myself to her family . With each mile he felt more and more uncertain . At one station , where they had stopped for fifteen minutes , there had been another train en route back to New York , and he had had a wild impulse to jump out and climb aboard and rush back to the city . With the discomfortof the journey , the cold and the snoring passengers and the sight of the grim hills breaking out of the cloudy night , more and more of his confidence had left him . Never , he was saying to himself , this will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way : She had been up here for two days now , and by this time she must have told her father that she was going to get married , and that she was going top210marry a Jew . It must have gone off all right , Noah thought , . forcing himself to be optimistic in the dusty car , otherwise she would have sent me a telegram . She 's let me come up here , so it must be all right , it must be .. . After the Army had rejected him , Noah had , as reasonably as he could , decided to rearrange his life in as rational and useful a way as possible . he had begun to spend three or four evenings a week in the library , reading blueprints for marine-construction work . Ships , they cried in the newspapers and on the radio , ships and more ships . Well , if he could n't fight , he could at least build . He had never studied a blueprint in his life , and he had only the vaguest notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , according to all authorities , it took months of intensive training for a man to become proficientat any of those things , but he studied with cold fury , memorizing , reciting to himself , making himself draw plans from memory again and again . hIe was at home with books and he learned quickly . In another month , he felt , he could go into a shipyard and bluff his way onto the scaffolding and earn his keep . And in the meantime , there was Hope . He felt a little guilty about planning his private happiness at a time when all his friends were going down into the horrors of war , but his abstinence would not bring Hitler to defeat any sooner , nor would the Emperor of Japan surrender any earlier if he , Noah , remained single  --  and Hope had been insistent . But she was very fond of her father . He was a devout churchgoer , a hardbitten Presbyterian elder , rooted stubbornly all his life in this harsh section of the world , and she would not marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staring across the aisle at a Marine Corporal who was sleeping , sprawled there , with his mouth open and his feet up in the air , Oh , God , why is the world so complicated ? There was a brickyard along the tracks , and a glimpse of one of those tightly-put-together , unpromising white streets with steeples rising at both ends . Then there was Hope , standing on the platform , searching the sliding , frosted windows for his face . He jumped down from the train before it stopped . He skidded a little on a patch of frozen snow , and nearly dropped the battered imitation-leather bag he was carrying as he fought to hold his balance . An old man who was pushing a trunk said to him testily , " That 's ice , young man . Ice . You ca n't toe-dance on it . " Then Hope hurried up to him . Her face was wan and disturbed.  |p211She  did n't kiss him . She stopped three feet away from him . " Oh , my , Noah , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The water , " he said , feeling irritated , " was frozen . " They stood there uncertainly facing each other . Noah looked hastily around to see if she was alone . Two or three other people had got off at the station , but it was early and no one had come to greet them and they were already hurrying off . Aside from the old man with the trunk , Noah and Hope had the station to themselves as the train started to pull out . It 's no good , Noah thought , they 've sent her down by herself to break the news . " Did you have a good trip ? " Hope said artificially . " Very nice , " Noah answered . She seemed strange and cold , bundled up in an old mackinaw and a scarf drawn tight over her hair . The northern wind cut across from the frozen hills , slicing through his overcoat as though it were the thinnest cotton . " Well , " Noah said , " do we spend Christmas here ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice trembling with the effort to keep it steady . " Noah , I did n't tell them . " " What ? " Noah asked stupidly . " I did n't tell them . Not anything . Not that you were coming . Not that I wanted to marry you . Not that you 're Jewish . Not that you 're alive . " Noah swallowed . What a silly , aimless way to spend Christmas , he thought foolishly , looking at the uncelebrating hills . " That 's all right , " he said . He did n't know what that meant , but Hope looked so forlorn standing there in her tightly drawn scarf , with her face pinched by the morning cold , that he felt he had to comfort her some way . " That 's perfectly all right , " he said , in the tone of a host telling a clumsy guest who has dropped a water glass that no great harm has been done . " Do n't worry about it . " " I meant to , " Hope said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the wind snatching at her words . " I tried to . Last night , I was on the point ... " She shook her head . " We came home from church and I thought I would be able to sit down in the kitchen with my father . But my brother came in , he 's over from Rutlandwith his wife and their children , for the holidays . They started to talk about the war , and my brother , he 's an idiot anyway , my brother began to say that there were no Jews fighting in the war and they were making all the money , and my father just sat there nod/ding . I do n't know whether he was agreeing or just getting sleepy the way he does at nine o'clock every night , and I just could n't bring myself .. . " That 's all right , " Noah kept saying stupidly , " that 's perfectly all right . " He moved his hands vaguely in their gloves because they were getting numb . I must get breakfast soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't stay here with you , " Hope said . " I 've got to get back . Everybody was asleep when I left the house , but they 'll probably be up by now , and they 'll wonder where I am . I 've got to go to church with them , and I 'll try to get my father alone after church . " " Of course , " Noah said , with lunatic briskness . " Exactly the thing to do . " " There 's a hotel across the street . " Hope pointed to a three-story frame building fifty yards away . " You can go in there and get something to eat and freshen up . I 'll come and get you around eleven o'clock . Is that all right ? " she asked anxiously . " Could n't be better , " Noah said . " I 'll shave . " He smiled brightly , as though he had just thought of some brilliantly clever notion . " Oh , Noah , darling ... " She came closer to him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm so sorry . I 've failed you , I 've failed you . " " Nonsense , " he said softly , " nonsense . " But in his heart he knew she was right . She had failed him . He was surprised more than anything else . She had always been so dependable , she had so much courage , she had always been so frank and candid in everything she did with him . But mixed with the disappointment and the hurt at being damaged this way on this cold Christmas morning , he was a little glad that for once she had failed . He was certain that he had failed her again and again and would , from time to time , fail her in the future . There was a juster balance between them now , and there would be something for which he could always forgive her . " Do n't worry , darling . " He smiled at her , grimed and weary . " I 'm sure it will all be fine . I 'll wait for you over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church . And ... " he grinned sadly , " pray a couple of prayers for me . " She smiled , near tears , then wheeled and strode away , in her crisp walk that even the heavy overshoes and the uncertain footing underneathcould not mar . He watched her disappear around a corner on her way back to the waking house in which her doubtful father andp213her talkative brother were even now waiting for her . He picked up his bag and made his way across the icy street to the hotel . As he opened the door of the hotel he stopped . Oh , God , he thought , I forgot to wish her Merry Christmas . It was twelve-thirty before there was a knock on the door of the gray little room with the flaking , painted iron bed and the cracked washstand that Noah had rented for two and a half dollars . That left him three dollars and seventy-five cents to celebrate the holiday with . He had his ticket back to the city though . He had not counted on having to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . Meals , he had discovered , were cheap in Vermont . Breakfast had been only thirty-five cents , with two eggs . He had groaned as he had gone wearily over his finances . Aside from war and love and the savage division between Jew and Gentile which had existed for almost 2000 years now until this stony Christmas morning , and the ordinary reluctance of a father to deliver his daughter over to a stranger , there was the weary arithmeticof living through the holiday with less than five dollars in your pocket . Noah opened the door , composing his face into what he thought was a quiet smile , with which to greet Hope . But it was n't Hope . It was a wrinkled , red-faced old man who worked for the hotel . " Lady and gentleman , " the man said briefly , " down in the lobby . " He turned and sauntered off . Noah looked anxiously at his face in the mirror , combed his short hair back in three jerky movements , straightened his tie , and left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneasily down the creaking stairs that smelled of wax and bacon fat , why would a man in his right mind say yes to me ? Three dollars to my name , with an alien religion , and a body that had been discarded as worthless by the government of the republic , and no profession , no real ambition except to live with and love his daughter . No family , no accomplishments , no friends , with a face that must seem harsh and foreign to this man , and a voice that nearly stuttered and was stained with the common accents of bad schools and low company from one end of America to the other . Noah had been in towns like this before and he knew what sort of men grew from them . Proud , private to themselves and their own kind , hard , with family histories that went back as far as the stones and planks of the towns themselves , looking with fear and scorn at the rootless foreign hordes which filled the cities . Noah hadp214never felt more of a stranger anywhere on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment when he stepped down into the hotel lobby from the stairway and saw the man and the girl sitting on the wooden rockers , looking out through the small plateglass windowat the frozen street . The two people stood up when they heard Noah come into the lobby . She 's pale , Noah 's mind registered , with a sense of catastrophe , very pale . He walked slowly toward the father and daughter . Mr. Plowman was a tall , stooped man , who looked as though he had worked with stone and iron all his life and had risen no later than five in the morning for the last sixty years . He had . an angular , reservedface , and weary eyes behind silver-rimmed glasses , and he gave no sign either of welcome or hostility , as Hope said , " Father , this is Noah . " He put his hand out , though . Noah shook it . The hand was tough and horny . I 'm not going to beg , Noah thought , no matter what . I 'm not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm anything much . If he says yes , fine . If he says no . . . Noah refused to think about that . " Very glad , " her father said , " to make your acquaintance . " They stood in an uneasy group , with the old man who served as clerk watching them with undisguised interest . " Seems to me , " Mr. Plowman said , " might not be a bad idea for myself and Mr. Ackerman to have a little talk . " " Yes , " Hope whispered , and the tense , uncertain timbre of her voice made Noah feel that all was lost . Mr. Plowman looked around the lobby consideringly . " This might not be the best place for it , " he said , staring at the clerk , who star'cd back curiously . " Might take a little walk around town . Mr. Ackerman might like to see the town , anyway . " " Yes , Sir , " Noah said . " I 'll wait here , " said Hope . She sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still lobby . The clerk made a severe , disapprovinggrimace at the sound and Noah was sure that he was going to hear the complaining wooden noise in his bad moments for many years . " We 'll be back in a half hour or so , Daughter , " Mr. Plowman said . Noah winced a little at the " Daughter . " It was like a bad play about life on the farm in 1900 , and he had an unreal sense of melodramaand heavy contrivance as he held the door open and he and Mr. Plowman went out into the snowy street . He caught a glimpsep215of Hope sitting behind the window , staring anxiously at them , and then they were walking slowly and deliberately past the closed shopfrontson the cleared sidewalks , in the harsh , windy cold . They walked without speaking for almost two minutes , their shoes making a dry crunching on the scraps of snow that the shovels had left on the pavements . Then Mr. Plowman spoke . " How much , " he asked , " do they charge you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " For one day ? " Mr. Plowman asked . " Yes . " " Highway robbers , " Mr. Plowman said . " All hotelkeepers . " Then he fell back into silence and they walked quietly once more . They walked past Marshall 's Feed and Grain store , past the drugstore of F. Kinne , past J. Gifford 's Men 's Clothing shop , past the law offices of Virgil Swift , past John Harding 's butcher shop and Mrs. Walton 's Bakery , past the furniture and undertaking establishment of Oliver Robinson , and N. West 's grocery store . Mr. Plowman 's face was set and rigid , and as Noah looked from his sharp , quiet features , noncommittally arranged under the oldfashionedSunday hat , to the storefronts , the names went into his brain like so many spikes driven into a plank by a methodical , impartialcarpenter . Each name was an attack . Each name was a wall , an announcement , an arrow , a reproof . Subtly , Noah felt , in an ingeniousquiet way , the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English names from which his daughter sprang . Deviously , Noah felt , the old man was demanding , how will an Ackerman fit here , a name imported from the broil of Europe , a name lonely , careless , un-owned and dispossessed , a name without a father or a home , a name rootless and accidental . It would have been better to have the brother here , Noah thought , talking , fulminating , with all the old , familiar , ugly , spoken arguments , rather than this shrewd , silent Yankee attack . They passed the business section , still in silence . A weathered red brick school building reared up across a lawn , covered with dead ivy . " Went to school there , " Mr. Plowman said , with a stiff gesture of his head . " Hope . " A new enemy , Noah thought , looking at the plain old building , crouched behind its oak trees , another antagonist lying in wait for twenty-five years . There was some motto carved into the weathered stone above the portal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , " the faded letters proclaimed to the generations of Plowmanswho. had walked under it to learn how to read and write and how their forefathers had set foot on the rock of Plymouth in the blustery weather of the seventeenth century , " Ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free . " Noah could almost hear his own father reading the words , the dead voice ringing out of the tomb with rhetorical , flaring relish . " Cost twenty-three thousand dollars , " Mr. Plowman said , " back in 1904 . WPA wanted to tear it down and put up a new one in 1935 . We stopped that . Waste of the taxpayers ' money . Perfectly good school . " They continued walking . There was a church a hundred yards down the road , its steeple rising slender and austere into the morning sky . That 's where it 's going to happen , Noah thought despairingly . This is the shrewdest weapon coming up . There are probably six dozen Plowmans buried in that yard , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The church was made of white wood and lay delicately and solidly on its sloping snowy lawns . It was balanced and reserved and did not cry out wildly to God , like the soaring cathedrals of the French and the Italians , but rather addressed Him in measured , plain terms , brief , dryly musical , and to the point . " Well , " said Mr. Plowman while the church was still fifty yards away , " we 've probably gone far enough . " He turned . " Like to go back ? " " Yes , " Noah said . He was dazed and puzzled , and walked automatically , almost unseeingly , as they started back toward the hotel . The blow had not fallen yet , and there was no indication when it would fall . IIe glanced at the old man 's face . There was a look of concentration and puzzlement there , among the granite lines , and Noah felt that he was searching painfully in his mind for the proper , cold , thoughtful words with which to dismiss his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisive , reasonable but final . " You 're doing an awful thing , young fellow , " Mr. Plowman said , and Noah felt his jaw grow rigid as he prepared to fight . " You 're puttingan old man to the test of his principles . I wo n't deny it . I wish to God you would turn around and get on the train and go back to New York and never see Hope again . You wo n't do that , will you ? " He peered shrewdly at Noah . " No , " said Noah . " I won't. "  | " Did n't think you would . Wouldn't 've been up here in the first place if you would . " The old man took a deep breath , stared at the cleared pavements before his feet , as he walked slowly at Noah 's side . " Excuse me if I 've given you a pretty glum walk through town , " he said . " A man goes a good deal of his life living more or less automatically . But every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real decision . He has to say to himself , now , what do I really believe , and is it good or is it bad ? The last forty-five minutes you 've had me doing that , and I 'm not fond of you for it . Do n't know any Jews , never had any dealings with them . I had to look at you and try to decide whether I thought Jews were wild , howling heathen , or congenital felons , or whatever . .. Hope thinks you 're not too bad , but young girls 've made plenty of mistakes before . All my life I thought I believed one man was born as good as another , but thank God I never had to act on it till this day . Anybody else show up in town asking to marry Hope , I 'd say , Come out to the house . Virginia 's got turkey for dinner ... ' They were in front of the hotel now . Noah had n't noticed it , listening to the old man 's earnest voice , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . The old man stopped and wiped his mouth reflectively as his daughter stood there staring at him , her face worried and set-looking . Noah felt as though he had been confined to a sickbed for weeks , and the list of names on the storefronts , the Kinnes and Vests and Swifts marshalled behind him , and the names on the tombstones in the churchyard , and the cold , unrelenting church itself , and the deliberatevoice of the old man , suddenly , all together , with the pale , harrowed sight of Hope herself , became intolerable . He had a vision of his warm , tumbled room near the river , with the books and the old piano , and he longed for it with an aching intensity . " Well ? " Hope said . " Well , " her father said slowly . " I just been telling Mr. Ackerman , there 's turkey for dinner . " Slowly , Hope 's face broke into a smile . She leaned over and kissed her father . " What in Heaven took so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it was going to be all right , although at the moment he was too spent and weary to feel anything about it . " Might as well take your things , young man , " Mr. Plowman said No sense giving those robbers all your money . " " Yes , " Noah said . " Yes , of course . " He moved slowly and dreamilyp218up the steps into the hotel . He opened the door and looked back . Hope was holding her father 's arm . The old man was grinning . It was a little forced and a little painful , but it was a grin . " Oh , " said Noah , " I forgot . Merry Christmas . " Then he went in to get his bag.  |p219THE  DRAFT BOARD was in a large bare loft over a Greek restaurant . The smell of frying oil and misused fish swept up in waves . The floor was dirty . There were only two bare lights glaring down on the rickety wooden camp chairs and the cluttered desks with the two plain secretaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room from the section where the board was meeting , and a hum of voices filtered through . There were about a dozen people sitting on the camp chairs , grave , almost middle-aged men in good business suits , an Italian boy , in a leather jacket , with his mother , several young couples , holding hands defensively . They all look , Michael thought , as though they are at bay , resentful , bitter , staring at the frayed paper American flag and the mimeographed and printed announcements on the walls . They all sit , Michael thought , like people with dependents or deferable physical ailments . And their women , the wives and mothers , glared accusingly at all the other men , as though they were on the verge of saying , " I can see through you . You 're in perfect health and you have plenty of money hidden away in the vault , and you want my son or my husband to go instead of you . Well , you 're not going to get away with it . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark-eyed boy calve out with his mother . The mother was crying and the boy wasp220red-faced , half-angry , half-frightened . Everyone in the room looked at him , coldly and measuringly , alieady seeing the still form on the battlefield , the white wood cross , the Western Union messenger ringingthe doorbell with the telegram in his hand . There was no pity in their glances , only a harsh satisfaction that seemed to say , " Well , there 's one son of a bitch that did n't fool them . " There was a buzz from the machine on the desk of one of the secretaries . She stood up and looked bleakly out across the room . " Michael Whitacre , " she called . Her voice was rasping and boredr She was an ugly girl with a large nose and a great deal of lipstick . Michael noticed , as he stood up , that her legs were bowed and her stockings were crooked and wrinkled . " Whitacre , " she called again , her voice bristling and impatient . He waved to her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I 'm on my way . " She stared at him with cold superiority . Michael could n't blame her . Added to the automatic insolence of a government employee was the heady sense of power that she was sending men out to die for her , who obviously had never had a man look kindly at her in her life . Each oppressed minority , Negroes , Mormons , Nudists , loveless women , Michael thought as he approached the door , to its own peculiarcompensations . It would take a saint to behave well on a draft board . As he opened the door , Michael noticed with surprise that he was trembling a little . Ridiculous , he thought , annoyed with himself , as he faced the seven men sitting at the long table . They swung around and looked at him . Their faces were the other side of the draftee 's coin . To match the fear and resentment and argument waiting in the outside room , here were unrelenting suspicion , shrewd , constantly reinforcedhardness . There is n't one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces , that I would ever talk to under any other circumstances . My neighbors . Who picked them ? Where did they come from ? What made them so eager to send their fellow-citizens off to war ? " Sit down , please , Mr. Whitacre , " said the chairman . He motioned glumly to the vacant chair at the head of the table . He was an old man , fat , with a face that had heavy , cold dewlaps , and angry , peering eyes . Even when he said " Please , " there was a peremptory challenge in his voice . What war , Michael thought , as he walked to his chair , did you fight in ?  |p221The  other faces swung around at him , like the guns of a cruiser preparing for a bombardment . Amazing , Michael thought , as he sat down , I 've lived in this neighborhood for ten years and I 've never seen a single one of these faces before . They must have been lying in wait , lurking secretly in the cellars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long wall behind the board , real cloth this time , a garish spot of color in the drab room , behind the gray and blue business suits of the board and their yellow complexions . Michael had a sudden vision of thousands of such rooms all over the country , thousands of such graying , cold-faced , suspicious men with the flag behind their balding heads , facing thousands of resentful , captured boys . It was probably the key scene of the moment , 1942 's most common symbol , the lines of terror and violence and guile brought to this single point , shabby , loveless , with only the promise of wounds and death to add any stature or nobility to the proceedings . " Now , Mr. Whitacre , " the chairman said , fumbling nearsightedly with a dossier , " you claim a 3A exemption here because of dependency . " He peered at Michael angrily , as though he had just said , " Where is the gun with which you shot the deceased ? " " Yes , " Michael said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudly , " that you are not living with your wife . " He looked triumphantly around him , and several of the other members of the board nodded eagerly . " We are divorced , " Michael said . " Divorced ! " the chairman said . " Why did you hide that fact ? " " Look , " Michael said , " I 'm going to save you a lot of time . I 'm going to enlist . " " When ? " " As soon as the play I 'm working on is put on . " " When will that be ? " a little fat man at the other end of the table asked in a sour voice . " Two months , " said Michael . " I do n't know what you have down on that paper , but I have to provide for my mother and father , and I have to pay alimony . . . " Your wife , " the chairman said bitterly , looking down at the papers before him , " makes five hundred and fifty dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Michael said . " She worked thirty weeks last year , " the chairman said . " That 's right , " Michael said wearily . " And not a week this year . "  | " Well , " said the chairman , with a wave , " we have to consider the probable earnings . She 's worked for the last five years and there 's no reason to suppose she wo n't continue . Also , " he glared down once more at the papers in front of him , " you claim your mother and father as dependents . " " Yes , " said Michael , sighing . " Your father , we have discovered , has a pension of sixty-eight dollars a month . " " That 's right , " said Michael . " Have you ever tried to support two people on sixty-eight dollars a month ? " " Everybody , " said the chairman with dignity , " has to expect to make some sacrifices at a time like this . " " I 'm not going to argue with you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to enlist in two months . " " Why ? " said a man down at the other end . He peered glitteringly through pince-nez glasses at Michael , as though ready to ferret out this last subterfuge . Michael looked around him at the seven glowering faces . He grinned . " I do n't know why , " he said . " Do you ? " " That will be all , Mr. Whitacre , " the chairman said . Michael got up and walked out of the room . He felt the eyes of all seven men on him , angry , resentful . They feel cheated , he realized suddenly , they would have much preferred to trap me into it . They were all prepared . The people waiting in the outside room looked up at him , surprised , because he had come out so quickly . He grinned at them . , He wanted to make a joke , but it would be too cruel to the taut , harried boys waiting so painfully . " Good night , darling , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't resist that . She looked at him with the unbreakable superiorityof the person who will not be called upon to die over the man who may . Michael was still smiling as he started down the steps through the thick fumes of the Greek cuisine , but he felt depressed . The first day , he thought , I should have gone in the first day . I shouldn't 've exposed myself to a scene like that . He felt soiled and suspect as he walked slowly through the mild late winter night , among the strolling couples oblivious to the tattered , shabby war being fought between one soul and another , in their name , in the dirty loft over the Greek restaurant half a block away.  |p223Two  mornings later , when he went down for his mail , there was a card from his draft board . " As per your request , " it read , " you will he reclassified as IA on May 15 . " He laughed as he read it . They have salvaged victory out of the ruins of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went upstairs again in the elevator . There were no more decisions to be made.  |p224NOAH  OPENED HIS EYES in the soft dawn light and looked at his wife . She sleeps , he thought , as though she were keeping a secret . Hope , he thought , Hope , Hope . She must have been one of those grave little girls , walking through that white clapboard town , always looking as though she was hurrying to some private destination . She probably had little caches of things stuffed away in the odd corners of her room , too . Feathers , dried flowers , old fashion plates from Harper 's Bazaar , drawings of women with bustles , that sort of thing . You did n't know anything about little girls . Would be differentif you had sisters . Your wife came to you out of a locked vault of experience . Might just as well have come from the mountains of Tibet or a French nunnery . While he was smoking cigarettes under the roof at Colonel Drury 's Military Academy for Boys , We Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing , walking gravely past the churchyard with all the Plowmans tucked in under the old grass ? If there was a plan to anything , she was preparing for him then , preparing for this moment of sleeping beside him in the dawn light . And he had been preparing for her . If there was a plan . Impossible to believe . If Roger had n't somehow met her ( how did he meet her ? Must ask ) . If Roger had n't half-ironically decided to have a party to get him a girl . If Roger had brought one of the dozen other girls he knew , they would n't be lying here together this morning . Accident ,  |p225the  only law of life . Roger . " You make time and you make love dandy , You make swell molasses candy , But honey , are you makin ' any money , That 's all I want to know . " Caught in the Philippines , Bataan , if he had lived that long . And here they were in Roger 's room , in Roger 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old bed slanted to the right . It all started when he reached up to the copy of Yeats ' The Herne 's Egg and Other Plays on the library shelf . If he had reached for another book , he wouldn't 've bumped into Roger and he would n't have lived here and he wouldn't 've met Hope and she probably would be lying in another bed now , with another man watching her , thinking , I love her , I love her . If you thought about it you stared into the shouting pit of madness . No plan to anything . No plan to loving or dying or fighting or anything . The equation : Man plus his intentions equals Accident . Impossible to believe . The plan must be there , but cleverly camouflaged , the way a good playwright disguises his plot . At the moment you die perhaps everything is clear to you , you say , oh , now I see , that 's why that character was introduced in the first act . Bataan . Hard to think of Roger saying " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Roger in a helmet . Always thought of him with that tipped , broken , brown felt hat across his head . Hard to think of Roger in a muddy hole . Hard to think of a man who could play Beethoven on the piano being shelled in the jungle . Hard to think of Roger losing , even in a war . Roger was a born victor , because victory in anything never seemed very important to him , it amused him . Hard to think of Roger being torn apart by a mortar shell , screaming , or falling with machine-gun bullets in his chest . Hard to think of Roger surrendering . " Oh , my God , " you could imagine him saying , grinning crookedly at the Jap who made the request , " are you kidding ? " Hard to think of Roger 's grave under the palm trees , Roger 's skull laid bare by time in the jungle mold . Had Roger ever kissed Hope ? Probably . ! low many other men ? The secret face on the pillow . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what visions had she manufactured as she lay waiting in her single bed in Vermont and Brooklyn ? And how many of the other men lay dead in the Pacific ' And how many of the others , boys and men she had touched , longed for , had unspeakable dreams about , were walking alive now and would be dead this year or next somewhere in the world ? What time was it ? Six-fifteen . Another five minutes in bed . This was going to be a kind of holiday today . No nervous thunder of the riveters , no wind on the scaffolds , none of the hiss and flare of thep226welders in the shipyard in Passaic . He had to go to his draft board today , and once more to Governor 's Island to be examined . The systemkept repeating itself , like a bank-teller with a bad memory , addingthe same line of figures over and over again . Once more the Wassermann , once more the careless finger pressing the testicles , " Cough , " no hernia , once more the bored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " What a degrading way to phrase that question . The Army 's belief that relations with your fellowman could only be unnatural . What about his relations with Roger , and Vincent Moriarity , the foreman on his shift at the shipyard , who bought him beers and boasted that he pulled down the British flag over the post office in Dublin , Easter week , 1916 ? What about his relations with his wife 's father , who had sent him his own edition of the collected works of Emerson as a wedding gift ? What of his relations with his own father , who had wandered half across the world from Odessa , full of lust and lies and prophecy , and who now was a small box of ashes neglected on a mausoleum shelf in California ? What of his relations with Hitler and Roosevelt , with Thomas Jefferson and Shakespeare , with Colonel Drury in the crumbling gray buildings out side Detroit , who drank a quart of bourbon every afternoon , who had once told the graduating class , " There is only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who is not quick to take offense . " What of his relations to his own son , not yet conceived , but latent and attendant here in this dawn bed between Hope and himself ? Would his on be quick to take offense ? Offense at what ? Who would give him offense and what the cause and how decided ? Was there a grave waiting for him somewhere , too , on some far island ? Was there a bullet , not yet made , that would bring down his son , not yet born ? Was there an unconceived soul somewhere on another continent , who later in the century would peer out across rifle sights at the heart of his son ? And what God would the minister address at the funeral service ? Christ , Jehovah , Who ? Maybe an uneasy double address , like a careful gambler 's hedged bet . " To Whatever God It May Concern  --  kindly accept this dead boy into Whatever Hereafter You happen to run . " Ridiculous to lie here next to a girl you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has not yet announced his coming , is going to be buried . Other problems , though , before that . Would he be christened ? Would he be circumcised ? " You circumciseddog ! " in Ivanhoe , in the first term in high school . In Budapest , in the pogroms , when the Revolutionary Government wasp227overthrown in 1920 , the crowds tore down the trousers of suspected Jews and murdered every male who had been circumcised . The poor Christians who had had it done for sanitary reasons . Probably hated the Jews as heartily as any of their executioners , and yet there they were , dying in that approximate hatred . Must stop thinking about the Jews . If you let yourself fall into a reverie , on no matter what subject , it finally came around to that . Wonder if there was ever a time when a Jew could avoid that ? What century ? The fifth century before Christ , perhaps . Six-twenty . Time to get up . The doctors were waiting on the green island , the ferry with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamp with Rejected on it . What did they do in older wars ? Before x-ray . How many men fought at Shiloh with scars on their lungs , all unknowing ? How many men came to Borodino with stomachulcers ? How many at Thermopylae who would be turned back by their draft boards today for curvature of the spine ? How many 4F 's perished outside Troy ? Time to get up . Hope stirred beside him . She turned to him and put her arm across his chest . She came slowly out from the backstage of sleep and ran her hand lightly , in half-slumbering possession , down his ribs and his stomach . " Bed , " she murmured , still in the grip of the last dream , and he grinned at her and gathered her close to him . " What time is it ? " she whispered , her lips close to his ear . " Is it morning ? Do you have to go ? " " It 's morning , " he said . " And I have to go . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pressed the familiar , slender body , " but I think the government can wait another fifteen minutes . " Hope was washing her hair when she heard the key in the lock . She had come home from work and seen that Noah had n't returned yet from Governor 's Island , and she had puttered around the house , without switching on a lamp , in the summer twilight , waiting for him to get back . With her head bent over the basin , and the soapy water dripping onto her closed eyelids , she heard Noah come into the big room . " Noah , " she called , " I 'm in here , " and she wrapped a towel around her head and turned to him , naked except for that . His face was sober and controlled . IIe held her loosely , gently touching the base of her neck , still wet from the rinsing.  | " It happened , " she said . " Yes , " he said . " The x-ray ? " " Did n't show anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Did you tell them ? " she asked . " About the last time ? " " No . " She wanted to ask why not , but she stopped herself , because in a confused , intuitive way , she knew . " You did n't tell them that you had a defense job , either , did you ? " " No . " " I 'll tell them , " she said loudly . " I 'll go down myself . A man with scars on his lungs ca n't be . . . " Sssh , " he said . " Sssh . " " It 's silly , " she said , trying to talk reasonably , like a debater . " What good will a sick man do in the Army ? You 'll only crack up . It 'll just be another burden for them . They ca n't make you a soldier . .. " " They can try . " Noah smiled slowly . " They sure can try . The least I can do is give them a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear , " anyway , they 've already done it . I was sworn in at eight o'clock tonight . " She pulled back . " What 're you doing here then ? " " Two weeks , " he said . " They give you two weeks to settle your affairs . " " Will it do any good , " Hope asked , " for me to argue with you ? " " No , " he said very softly . " Goddamn them ! " Hope said . " Why do n't they get things straight the first time ? Why , " she cried , addressing the draft boards and the Army doctors and the regiments in the field and the politicians in all the capitals of the world , addressing the war and the time and all the agony ahead of her , " why ca n't they behave like sensible human beings ? " " Sssh , " Noah said . " We only have two weeks . Let 's not wastc them . Have you eaten yet ? " " No , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sat down on the edge of the tub , smiling wearily at her . " Finish your hair , " he said , " and we 'll go out to dinner . There 's a place I heard about on Second Avenue where they have the best steaks in the world . Three dollars apiece , but they 're . . . " She threw herself down at his knees and held him tightly . " Oh , darling , " she said , " oh , darling . . .  |p229He  stroked her bare shoulder as though he were trying to memorize it . " For the next two weeks , " he said , his voice almost not trembling , " we will go on a holiday . That 's how we 'll settle my affairs . " He grinned at her . " We 'll go up to Cape Cod and swim and we 'll hire bicycles and we 'll eat only three-dollar steaks at every meal . Please , please , darling , stop crying . " Hope stood up . She blinked twice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's stopped . I wo n't cry again . It 'll take me fifteen minutes to get ready . Can you wait ? " " Yes , " he said . " But hurry . I 'm starved . " She took the towel off her head and finished washing her hair . Noah sat on the edge of the tub and watched her . From time to time Hope got glimpses of his drawn , thin face in the mirror . She knew that she was going to remember the way his face looked then , lost and loving as he sat perched on the porcelain rim , in the cluttured , garishly lit room , remember for a long , long time . They had their two weeks on Cape Cod . They stayed at an aggressivelyclean tourist house with an American flag on a pole on the lawn in front of it . They ate clam chowder and broiled lobster for dinner . They lay on the pale sand and swam in the dancing , cold water and went to the movies religiously at night , without commenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the charging , tremulous voices describing death and defeat and victory on the flickering screen . They rented bicycles and rode slowly along the seasideroads and laughed when a truckload of soldiers passed and whistled at Hope 's pretty legs , and called to Noah , " Pretty soft , Bud . What 's your draft number , Bud ? We 'll see you soon ! " Their noses peeled and their hair got sticky with salt , and their skin , when they went to bed at night , smelled ocean-fragrant and sunny in the immaculate sheets of the shingled cottage in which they lived . They hardly spoke to anyone else , and the two weeks seemed to stretch through the summer , through the year , through every summer they had ever known , and all time seemed to go in a gentle spiral on sandy roads , between scrub firs , in a gleam of summer light on brisk waves and under the stars of cool summer evenings stirred by a holiday wind that came off the Vineyard and off Nantucket and off a sunny ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the splash of flying fish playing in the water . Then the two weeks were up and they went back to the city . Thep230people there seemed pallid and wilted , defeated by the summer , and they felt healthy and powerful in comparison . The final morning , Hope made coffee for them at six o'clock . They sat across from each other , sipping the hot , bitter liquid out of the huge cups that were their first joint domestic investment . Hope walked with Noah down the quiet , shining streets , still cool with the memory of . night , to the drab unpainted store that had been taken over by the draft board . They kissed , thoughtfully , already remote from each other , and Noah went in to join the quiet group of boys and men who were gathered around the desk of the middle-aged man who was serving his country in its hour of need by waking early twice a month to give the last civilian instructions and the tickets for the free subway ride to the groups of men departing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shuffling , self-conscious line , with the fifty others , and walked with them the three blocks to the subway station . The people on the street , going about their morning business , on their way to their shops and offices , on their way to the day 's marketingand the day 's cooking and money-making , looked at them with curiosity and a little awe , as the natives of a town might look at a group of pilgrims from another country who happen to pass through their streets , on their journey to an obscure and fascinating religious festival . Noah saw Hope across the street from the entrance to the subway station . She was standing in front of a florist 's shop . The florist was an old man slowly putting out pots of geraniums and large blue vases of gladioli in the window behind her . She had on a blue dress dotLtd with white flowers . The morning wind brushed it softly against her body in front of the blossoms shining through the glass behind her . Because of the sun reflecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was like . He started to cross the street to her , but the leader that the man at the draft board had assigned to the group called anxiously , " Please , boys , stick together , please , " and Noah thought , what could I tell her , what could she tell me ? He waved to her . She waved back , a single , lifting gesture of the bare brown arm . In the shadow she created with the movement , Noah could see she was n't crying . What do you know , he said to himself , she is n't crying . And he went down into the subway , between a boy named Tempesta and a thirty-five-year-old Spaniard whose name was Nuncio Aguilar.  |p231THE  RED-HEADED WOMAN he had n't kissed four years agoleaned over , smiling , in Michael 's last dream and kissed him . He awoke , warmly remembering the dream and the red-headed woman . The morning sun angled past the sides of the closed Venetian blinds , framing the windows in a golden dust . Michael stretched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million people walking through the streets and corridors of the city . Michael got up . He padded over on the carpeted floor to the window and pulled up the blinds . The sun filled the back gardens with an early summer wealth , soft and buttery on the faded brick of the old buildings , on the dusty ivy , on the bleached striped awnings of the small terraces filled with rattan furniture and potted plants . A little round woman , in a wide orange hat and old fat slacks that clung cheerfully to her round behind , was standing over a potted geranium on the terrace directly across from Michael . She reached thoughtfully down and snipped off a blossom . Her hat shook sorrowfully as she looked at the mortal flower in her hand . Then she turned and walked through curtained French windows into her house , her cheerful behind shaking , middleagedand healthy , in her city garden . Michael grinned , pleased that it was sunny , and that the red-headed woman had finally kissed him , and that there was a fat little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side of the sunny back gardens . He washed , dousing himself with cold water , then walked barefoot , in his pajamas , across the carpeted floor through the living room , to the front door . He opened it and picked up the Times . In the polite print of the Times , which always reminded Michael of the speeches of elderly and successful corporation lawyers , the Russianswere dying but holding on the front page , there were new fires along the French coast from English bombs , Egypt was reeling , somebody had discovered a new way to make rubber in seven minutes , three ships had sunk quietly into the Atlantic Ocean , the Mayor had come out against meat , married men could be expected to be called up into the Army , the Japanese were in a slight lull . Michael closed the door . He sank onto the couch and turned away from the blood on the Volga , the drowned men of the Atlantic , the sand-blinded troops of Egypt , from the rumors of rubber and the flames in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page . The Dodgers , steadfast  --  though weary and full of error  --  had passed through another day of war and thousand-edged death , and despite some nervousness down the middle of the diamond and an attack of wildness in the eighth , had won in Pittsburgh . The phone rang and he went into the bedroom and picked it up . " There 's a glass of orange juice in the icebox . " Peggy 's voice came over the wire . " I thought you 'd like to know . " " Thanks , " Michael said . " I noticed some dust on the books on the right-hand shelves , though , Miss Freemantle . . . " Nuts , " Peggy said . " There 's a lot in what you say , " Michael said , delighted with Peggy 's voice , familiar and full of pleasure over the phone . " Are they working you hard ? " " The flesh off the bones . You were taking it mighty easy when I left . Flat on your back , with all the covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice girl you are . What did I do ? " There was a little pause and then , for a moment , Peggy 's voice was sober and a little troubled . " You put your hands over your face and you mumbled , I wo n't , I wo n't . . " The little half-smile that had been playing about Michael 's face died . He rubbed his ear thoughtfully . " The sleeping man betrays us unashamed morning after morning . " " You sounded frightened , " Peggy said . " It frightened me. "  | " I wo n't , I wo n't , ' " Michael said reflectively . " I do n't know what it was I would n't . . . Anyway , I 'm not frightened now . The morning'sbright , the Dodgers won , my girl made me orange juice .. . " " What 're you going to do today ? " Peggy asked . " Nothing much . Wander around . Look at the sky . Look at the girls . Drink a little . Make my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peggy 's voice was serious . " Sorry , " Michael said . " Are you glad I called you ? " Peggy 's voice was consciously a little coquettish now . " Well , I suppose there was no way of avoiding it , " Michael said languidly . " You know what you can do . " " Peggy ! " She laughed . " Do I get dinner tonight ? " " What do you think ? " " I think I get dinner . Wear your gray suit . " " It 's practically worn through at the elbows . " " Wear your gray suit . I like it . " " O.K. " " What 'll I wear ? " For the first moment in the conversation Peggy 's voice became uncertain , littlegirlish , worried . Michael laughed softly . " What 're you laughing at ? " Peggy asked harshly . " Say it again . Say What 'll I wear ? ' again for me . " " Why ? " " Because it makes me laugh and remember you and makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear you say , What 'll I wear ?

The blue print or the beige suit with the cream blouse or the . . . " The blue print . " " It 's so old . " " The blue print . " " All right . Hair up or down ? " " Down . " " But ... "  | " Down ! " " God , " Peggy said , " I 'll look like something you dragged out of the Harlem River . Are n't you afraid some of your friends 'll see us ? " " I 'll take my chances , " Michael said . " And do n't drink too much ... " " Now , Peggy . . " " You 'll be going around saying good-bye to all your good friends . . . " Peggy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pour you into the Army from a bucket . Be careful . " " I 'll be careful . " " Glad I called ? " Peggy sounded again like a flirtatious girl languishingbehind a fan at the high-school prom . " I 'm glad you called , " Michael said . " That 's all I wanted to know . Drink your orange juice . " And she hung up . Michael put the receiver down slowly , smiling , remembering Peggy . He sat for a moment , thinking of her . Then he got up and went out through the living room to the kitchen . He put some water up to boil and measured out three heapingspoonfuls of coffee , his nose grateful for the ever-beautiful smell of the coffee imprisoned in the can . He drank his orange juice in long cold gulps , between getting out bacon and the eggs and cutting the bread for toast . He hummed wordlessly as he prepared his breakfast . He liked making his own breakfasts , private in his single house , with his pajamas flapping about him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put five strips of bacon in a large pan and set a small flame going under it . The telephone rang in the bedroom . " Oh , hell , " Michael said . He moved the bacon pan off the flame and walked through the living room , noticing , almost unconsciously , as he did again and again , what a pleasant room it was , with its high ceilings and broad windows facing each other , and the books piled into the bookcases all over the room , with the faded spectrum of the publisher 's linen covers making a subtle and lovely pattern , wavering along the walls . Michael picked up the phone and said , " Hello . " " Hollywood , California , calling Mr. Whitacre . " " This is Mr. Whitacre.  |p235Then  Laura 's voice , across the continent , still deep and artful . " Michael ? Michael , darling . . . Michael sighed a little . " Hello , Laura . " " It 's seven o'clock in the morning in California , " Laura said , a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning to speak to you . " " Thanks , " Michael said . " I heard about it , " Laura said vehemently . " I think it 's awful . Makingyou a private . " Michael grinned . " It 's not so awful . There 're a lot of people in the same boat . " " Almost everybody out here , " Laura said , " is at least a Major . " " I know , " Michael said . " Maybe that 's a good reason for being a private . " " Stop being so damned special ! " Laura snapped . " You 'll never be able to make it . I know what your stomach 's like . " " My stomach , " Michael said gravely , " will just have to join the Army with the rest of me . " " You 'll be sorry the day after tomorrow . " " Probably . " Michael nodded . " You 'll be in the guardhouse in two days , " Laura said loudly . " A Sergeant 'll say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know you . " " Listen , " Michael said patiently . " Nobody hits Sergeants . Not me or anybody else . " " You have n't taken an order from anybody in your whole life , Michael . I know you . That was one of the reasons it was impossible to live with you . After all , I lived with you for three years and I know you better than any . . . " Yes , Laura , darling , " Michael said patiently . " We may be divorced and all that , " Laura went on rapidly , " but there 's no one in the whole world I 'm fonder of . You know that . " " I know that , " Michael said , believing her . " And I do n't want to see you killed . " She began to cry . " I wo n't be killed , " Michael said gently . " And I hate to think of you being ordered around . It 's wrong ... " Michael shook his head , wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman 's version of the world . " Do n't you worry about me , Laura , darling , " he said . " And it was very sweet of you to call me. "  | " I 've decided something , " Laura said firmly . " I 'm not going to take any more of your money . " Michael sighed . " Have you got a job ? " " No . But I 'm seeing MacDonald at MGM this afternoon , and ... " " O.K. When you work , you do n't take any money . That 's fine . " Michael rushed past the point , not letting Laura speak . " I read in the paper you 're going to get married . That true ? " " No . Maybe after the war . He 's going into the Navy . He 's going to work in Washington . " " Good luck , " Michael murmured . " There was an assistant director from Republic they took right into the Air Corps . First Lieutenant . He wo n't leave Santa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to be a private . . . " Please , Laura darling , " Michael said . " This call will cost you five hundred dollars . " " You 're a queer , stupid man and you always were . " " Yes , darling . " " Will you write me where they station you ? " " Yes . " " I 'll come and visit you . " " That will be wonderful . " Michael had a vision of his beautiful exwifein her mink coat and her almost famous face and figure , waiting outside Fort Sill , Oklahoma , with the soldiers whistling at her as they went past , while he rushed from a formation to meet her . " I feel all mixed up about you . " Laura was crying softly and honestly . " I always did and I always will . " " I know what you mean . " Michael remembered the way Laura looked fixing her hair in front of a mirror and how she looked dancingand the holidays they 'd had . For a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lost years behind him , the years without war , the years without separations .. . " What the hell , " he said softly . " They 'll probably put me in an office some place . " " You wo n't let them , " she sobbed . " I know you . You wo n't let them . " " You do n't let the Army do anything . It does what it wants and you do what it wants . The Army is n't Warner Brothers , darling . " " Promise me . .. promise me ... " The voice rose and fell and then there was a click and the connection was cut off . Michael looked at the phone and put it down.  |p237Finally  he got up and went into the kitchen and finished making his breakfast . He carried the bacon and eggs and toast and coffee , black and thick , into the living room and put it down on the wide table set in front of the great sunny window . He turned the radio on . Brahms was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the machine , round , disputatious and melancholy . He ate slowly , smearing marmalade thickly on the toast , enjoying the buttery taste of the eggs and the strong taste of the coffee , proud of his cooking , listening with pleasure to the mournful sweet thunder of the radio . He opened the Times to the theatrical page . It was full of rumors of endless plays and endless actors . Each morning he read the theatricalpage of the Times with growing depression . Each morning the recital of baffled hope and money lost and sorrowful critical reproach of his profession made him feel a little silly and restless . He pushed the paper aside and lit the day 's first cigarette and took the last sip of coffee . He turned the radio off . It was playing Respighi by now , anyway , and Respighi quit the morning air with a dying fall and left the sunlit house in fragrant silence as Michael sat at the breakfast table , smoking , staring dreamily out at the gardens and the diagonal glimpse of street and working people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and showered . Then he put on a pair of old flannels and a soft old blue shirt , gently and beautifully faded from many launderings . Most of his clothes were already packed away , but there were still two jackets hanging in the closet . He stood there thoughtfully , trying to make up his mind for a moment , then picked the gray jacket , and put it on . It was a worn old jacket , soft and light on his shoulders . Downstairs his car was waiting at the curb , its paint and chromium glistening from the garage 's  --  industry . He started the motor and pushed the button for the top . The top came down slowly and majestically . Michael felt the usual touch of amusement at the grave collapsing movement . He drove up Fifth Avenue slowly . Every time he rode up through the city on a working day , he felt once again some of the same slightly malicious pleasure he had experienced the first day he had driven in his first , brand-new car , top down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working men and women thronging to their lunches , and feelingwealthy and noble and free.  |p238Michael  drove up the broad street , between the rich windows , frivolous and wealthy and elegantly suggestive in the sun . Michael left his car at the door of Cahoon 's apartment house , givingthe keys to the doorman . Cahoon was going to use the car and take care of it until Michael returned . It would have been more sensibleto sell the car , but Michael had a superstitious feeling that the bright little machine was a token of his gayest civilian days , long rides in the country in the springtime , and careless holidays , and that he must somehow preserve it as a charm against his return . On foot , feeling a little bereft , he walked slowly across town . The day stretched ahead of him with sudden emptiness . He went into a drugstore and called Peggy . " After all , " he said , when he heard her voice , " there 's no law that says I ca n't see you twice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry about one , " she said . " I 'll buy you lunch , if that 's what you want . " " That 's what I want . " Then , more slowly , " I 'm glad you called . I have something very serious to say to you . " " All right , " Michael said . " I feel pretty serious today . One o'clock . " He hung up , smiling . He walked out into the sunlight and headed downtown , toward his lawyer 's office , thinking about Peggy . He knew what the serious talk she wanted to have at lunch would be about . They had known each other for about two years , rich , warm years , a little desperate because day by day the war came closer and closer . Marriage in this bloody year was a cloudy and heartbreaking business . Marry and die , graves and widows ; the husband-soldier carrying his wife 's photograph in his pack like an extra hundred pounds of lead ; the single man mourning furiously in the screaming jungle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blinded veteran listening for his wife 's chained footstep .. . " Hey , Michael ! " A hand slapped him on the shoulder . He turned . It was Johnson , in a rough felt hat with a colored band , and a full knitted tie and a beautiful cream-colored shirt under the soft blue jacket . " I 've been wanting to see you forever ... Are n't you ever home ? " " Not recently . I took a vacation . " From time to time , Michael liked to see Johnson and have dinner with him and listen to him argue in his deep , actorish voice . But ever since the bitterness of the arguments about the Nazi-Soviet pact , Michael had found it almostp239impossible to talk civilly for a whole evening with Johnson or any of his friends. ... and I sent you this petition , " Johnson was saying , gripping Michael 's arm as they walked downtown swiftly , because Johnson never did anything slowly . " And it 's so important and your name should be on it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the second front . Everybody 's signing it . " Real anger showed in Johnson 's face . " It 's a crime , the way we 're letting the Russians bear the whole brunt ... " Michael did n't say anything . " Do n't you believe in the second front ? " Johnson asked . " Sure . " Michael nodded . " If they can swing it . " " They can swing it all right . " " Maybe . Maybe they 're afraid they 'll lose too many men . Maybe , " Michael said , suddenly realizing that tomorrow he would be in khaki and eligible for the landing on the beach of Europe , " maybe it 'll cost a million , a million and a half lives ... " " So it 'll cost a million , a million and a half lives , " Johnson said loudly , walking even more quickly down the street . " It 's worth it .. . A major diversion . Even two million lives .. . Michael looked at his friend strangely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4F neatly on his draft registration card , calling so debonairly for the blood of other men on this handsome city boulevard , feeling religious and just because far away on another continent the Russians were fighting like lions . What would a Russian soldier , crouched behind a broken wall in Stalingrad , facing the oncoming tank , grenade in hand , think of this soft-voiced patriot in his fuzzy hat who called him brother , on the unruined street in the unruined city in America ? " Sorry , " Michael said . " I 'd like to do all I can to help the Russians , but I think I 'd better leave it up to the professionals . " Johnson finally stopped walking . He dropped his hand from ! Michael 's arm and stood there , his face tightened with anger and disdain . " I 'm going to tell you something frankly , Michael , " he said . " I 'm ashamed of you . " Michael nodded soberly , embarrassed because he could n't say what was in his heart without hurting Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I 've seen this coming . I 've seen you growing soft ... "  | " Sorry , " Michael said . " I 've been sworn In as a soldier of the Republic , and soldiers of the Republic do not send petitions to their Commander in Chief , instructing him on questions of high strategy . " " That 's an evasion . " " Maybe it is . So long . .. " Michael turned and walked away . After ten steps Johnson called , coolly , " Good luck , Michael . " Michael waved without looking back . He thought of Johnson and his other friends with displeasure . Either they were insensitively militant like Johnson , in their untouchablecivilian occupations , or , under a thin veneer of patriotism , they were cynical and resigned . And this was no time for resignation , Michael felt . This was no time for saying no or perhaps . This was a time for a great yea-saying . That was a good thing about getting into the Army . He would get away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicides . He had come of age at a time of critics , in a country of critics . Everyone criticized books and poetry and plays and government and the policies of England , France , and Russia . America for the last twenty years had been a perpetual dramacriticscircle , saying over and over again , " Yes , I know 3000 died at Barcelona , but how clumsy the second act ... " Age of critics , countryof critics . He had begun to feel it was a sour age and a barren country because of it . This was a time for roaring rhetoric , savage vengeance , melodramatic shouting of boasts and assurance down the corridors of night . This was a time for roistering and wild-eyed soldiers , crazy with faith , oblivious of death . Michael could see no faithmadnessaround him . Civilians saw too much of the cheapness of war for faith . . . the chicanery and treachery of the lovers of six percent , of the farm bloc and business bloc and labor bloc . He had gone into the good restaurants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric excitement and pleasure of the men and women who were making good money and spending it before the Government claimed it . Stay out of the Army and you had to turn critic . He wanted to be a critic only of the enemy . He felt silly sitting in the paneled room across the desk from his lawyer , reading through his will . Outside the window , high up in the tall building , the city shone in the everyday sunlight , the brick towers rearing into the soft blue haze , the streams of smoke from the boats on the river , the same city , looking exactly as it had always looked , and here he was , with his glasses on , reading , " ... one-third of thep241aforementioned estate to my former wife , Miss Laura Roberts . In the event of her marriage , this bequest is voided and the amount reserved in her interest will be joined to the residual amount left in the name of the executor and divided in this manner . . . He felt so healthy and whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked across at Piper , his lawyer . Piper was growing bald and had a pudgy , pale complexion like the inside of a classroom in torts and grievances . Piper was signing a batch of papers , his pudgy mouth pursed , happily making money , happily confident that with his three children and his recurrent arthritis he was never going to war . Michael regretted that he had not written out the will himself , in his own hand , in his own language . It was somehow shameful to be represented to the future in the dry and money-sly words of a bald lawyer who would never hear a gun fired any place . A will should be a short , eloquent , personal document that reflected the life of the man who signed it and whose last possessions and last wishes were being memorialized in it . To my mother , for the love I bear her , and for the agony she has endured and will later endure in my name and the name of my brothers . . . " To my ex-wife , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgive me in the same spirit of remembrance of our good days together . . . " To my father , who has lived a hard and tragic life , and who has behaved so bravely in his daily war , and whom , I hope , I shall see once more before he dies ... " But Piper had covered eleven typewritten pages , full of whereases , and in the events of , and now if Michael died , he would be known to the future as a long list of many-syllabled modifying clauses , and cautious businessman 's devices . Perhaps later , Michael thought , if I really think I am going to be killed , I shall write another one , better than this . He signed the four copies . Piper pressed the buzzer on his desk and two secretaries came in . One was a notary and carried her seal with her . She stamped the papers methodically , and they both signed as witnesses . Again Michael had the feeling it was all wrong , that this should be done by good friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel bereaved if he died . Michael looked at the date on the calendar . The thirteenth . Hep242grinned a little sourly . He was not a superstitious man , but perhaps this was carrying it too far . The secretaries went out , . , and Piper stood up . They shook hands , and Piper said , " I will keep an eye on things and I will mail you a monthly report on what you have earned , and what I have spent . " Sleeper 's play , in which Cahoon had given him a five percent interest , was doing very well , and it would undoubtedly sell to the movies , and there would be money coming in from it for two years . " I will be the richest private , " Michael said , " in the American Army . " " I still think , " Piper said , " that you ought to let me invest it for you . " No , thank you , " said Michael . He had gone over that again and again with Piper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good steel stocks himself and wanted Michael to buy some , too . But Michael had a stubborn , although vague and slightly shamefaced opposition to making money out of money , of profiting by the labor of other men . He had tried once to explain it to Piper , but the lawyer was too sensible for talk like that , and now Michael merely smiled and shook his head . Piper shrugged and put out his hand . " Good luck , " he said . " I 'm sure the war will be over very soon . " " Of course , " said Michael . " Thanks . " He left quickly , glad to get out of the lawyer 's office . He always felt trapped and restless when talking to lawyers or doing any business with them , and the feeling was even worse today . He rang for the elevator . It was full of secretaries on the way to lunch , and there was a smell of powder , and the eager , released bubbleof voices . As the elevator swooped down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , bright , lively people could endure being locked in among the typewriters , the books , the Pipers , the notaries ' seals and the legal language all their lives . As he walked north along Fifth Avenue , toward the restaurant where he was to meet Peggy , he felt relieved . Now he was through with all his official business . For this afternoon , and all the night , until six-thirty the next morning when he had to report to his draft board , life was quit of all claims on him . The civil authorities had relinquished him and the military authorities had not yet taken him up . It was one o'clock now . Seventeen and a half hours , unanchored , between one life and the next . He felt lightfooted and free and he looked fondly about him at the sunny wide street and the hurrying people , like a plantation ownerp243with a good breakfast under his belt strolling over the wide lawns of his estate and looking out over the stretching rich acres of his property . Fifth Avenue was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his granaries , the Park his greenhouse , the theatres his workshop , all well taken care of , busy , in their proper order .. . He thought of a bomb falling in the bright space between the Cathedral and Rockefeller Center and peered a little thoughtfully at the people beside him on the crowded avenue to see if there was any hint or premonition in their faces of that possible disaster . But the faces were as they always had been , preoccupied , all confident that bombs might fall on Saville Street , on the Place Vendome , on Unter den Linden , on Plaza Victor Emmanuel , on Red Square , but the world would never depart so far from its reasonable and appointed routine as to break one window in Saks ' . Michael walked along the gray cathedral sides to Madison Avenue . Nobody on Madison Avenue looked as though the possibility that a bomb might fall there had ever entered their heads . Two Air Force Lieutenants in summer uniforms were walking with new-found militarystiffness in front of the Columbia Broadcasting Building , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no place was invulnerable , not even the stone and flower courtyard of the Rockefeller 's , or the tall castle of the broadcasters . But the Lieutenantspassed him quickly , and perhaps all that he saw in their faces was anxiety that the girls they were going to meet might order the most expensive dishes on the menu for lunch . Michael stopped in front of a hat store . It was a good store and the hats cost fifteen and twenty-five dollars , soft rich browns and gray felts with quiet bands . No helmets there , no ugly little limp overseascaps , at whatever price , no headgear , garrison , no braid for the Air Force or the Infantry or the Medical Corps . That was going to be a problem in the Army . You had to wear a hat in the Army , and Michael had never worn a hat , even in the rain and the snow . Hats gave him a headache . If the war lasted five years could he expect to have a headache that lasted five years ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably already waiting . The various unexpected problems of a war . Like the business of the hats . And then the was very difficult to sleep in the same room with anyone else . Inp244the Army there were always at least fifty men sleeping in the same room with you . . . Could he expect to postpone his sleep until the war was over ? And the silly problem of the bathroom . Like most well brought-up persons of twentieth-century America , the ritual of the private bathroom with the locked door was one of the pillars of existence . Were all those important bodily functions supposed to cease until Hitler surrendered , while he , Michael , stared in loathing and revulsion at the long row of soldiers squatting over the open toilets in serried , grotesque ranks ? He sighed , saddened a little on the sunny Avenue . It would be easier , he thought , to stand and die in a bloodsoddentrench , knowing no help would ever come , than to walk into an enlisted man 's latrine and . . . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorly for the tests it puts you to . And then , the question of sex . Perhaps it was a matter of habit , as so many authorities insisted , but it was a deep habit and firmly ingrained . Married or single , in the pleasant freedom of the 1930 's and ' 40 's , ever since he was seventeen years old , he had constant and agreeable relations with women . The two or three periods of a week or more when he had for one reason or another to do with out women had been restless and unhappy times , with the riotous juices of his youth clouding in insistent thunder in his loins , making him irritable and nervous , preventing him from working , preventing him finally from thinking about anything else . In the manhordes of the Army , in the strict barracks , on the long marches and drill fields , in the foreign bivouacs ahead , there were hardly likely to be women convenient to the whims of a private soldier under the anonymous helmet and the anonymous title . Gene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celibacy for the soldiers of the Republic , solemnly announcing that medical authorities now agreed that it did no damage to the health . What would Freud have said to the conquerorof Dempsey ? Michael grinned . He could grin now , but he knew that later in the year , as he lay awake and furious on his narrow bed , in the masculine , snoring night of the barracks , the humor of the situation would not appeal to him so strongly . Sweet and fitting , Democracy , in thy name , it may be to die .. . but the other sacrifices , he thought , may he more difficult to manage . He turned down the two steps to the entrance of the little French restaurant . Through the window , he could see Peggy already sitting at the bar . The restaurant was crowded and they sat at the bar next to ap245slightly drunken sailor with bright red hair . Always , when he met Peggy like this , Michael spent the first two or three minutes silently looking at her , enjoying the quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arched eyes , admiring the simple , straight way she did her hair and the pleasant way she wore her clothes . All the best things about the city somehow seemed to have an echo and reflection in the tall , straight , dependable girl . . . And , now , when Michael thought about the city , it was inextricably mixed in his mind with the streets he had walked down with her , the houses they had entered , the plays they had seen together , the galleries they had gone to , the bars they had sat at late in the winter afternoons , when the cold had made the windows tinkle and the first drink had sunk in cool glory clown their throats . Looking at her , her cheeks flushed with her walk , her eyes bright with pleasure at seeing him , her long competent hands reachingout to touch his sleeve , it was impossible to believe that that eagerness or pleasure would ever wane , that there ever would be a time when he would return here and not find her , unchanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the sad , grotesque thoughts that had ( logged him uptown from the notarized will in his lawyer 's office left him . He smiled gravely at her and touched her hand and slid onto t he stool beside her . " What are you doing . this afternoon ? " he said . " Waiting . " " Waiting for what ? " " Waiting to be asked . " " All right , " Michael said . " You 're asked . An old-fashioned , " he said to the bartender . He turned back to Peggy . " Man I know , " he said , " has n't a thing to do until six-thirty tomorrow morning . " " What will I tell the people at my office ? " " Tell them , " he said gravely , " you are involved in a troop move-ment . " " I do n't know , " Peggy said . " My boss is against the war . " " Tell him the troops are against the war , too . " " Maybe I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will call him , " Michael said , " and tell him that when you were last seen you were floating toward Washington Square in a bourbon oId-fashioned . " " He does n't drink . " " Your boss , " said Michael , " is a dangerous alien . "  |p246They  clicked glasses gently . Then Michael noticed that the redheadedsailor was leaning against him , peering at Peggy . " Exactly , " said the sailor . " If you please , " Michael said , feeling free to speak harshly to men in uniform now , " this lady and I are having a private party . " " Exactly , " said the sailor . He patted Michael 's shoulder and Michael remembered the hungry Sergeant staring at Laura at lunchtimein Hollywood the day after the beginning of the war . " Exactly , " the sailor repeated . " I admire you . You have the right idea . Do n't kiss the girls in the town square and go off to fight the war . Stay home and lay them . Exactly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Excuse me , " said the sailor . He put some money down on the bar and put on his cap , very straight and white on top of his red hair . " It just slipped out . Exactly . I am on my way to Erie , Pennsylvania . " He walked out of the bar , very erect . Michael watched him walk out . He could n't help smiling , and when he turned back to Peggy he was still smiling . " The Armed Services , " he began , " makes confidants of every . . . " Then he saw she was crying . She sat straight on the high stool in her pretty brown dress and the tears were welling slowly and gravely down her cheeks . She did n't put up her hands to touch them or wipe them off . " Peggy , " Michael said quietly , gratefully noticing that the bartenderwas ostentatiously working with his head ducked at the other end of the bar . Probably , Michael thought , as he put out his hand to touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears these days and develop a technique to handle them . " I 'm sorry , " Peggy said . " I started to laugh but this is the way it came out . " Then the headwaiter came over in a little Italian flurry , and said , " Your table now , Mr. Whitacre . " Michael carried the drinks and followed Peggy and the waiter to a table against the wall . By the time they sat down Peggy had stopped crying , but all the eagerness was gone out of her face and Michael had never seen her face looking like that . They ate the first part of their meal in silence . Michael waited for Peggy to recover . This was not like her at all . IIe had never seen her cry before . He had always thought of her as a girl who faced what ever happened to her with quiet stoicism . She had never complained about anything or fallen into the irrational emotional fevers he hadp247more or less come to expect from the female sex , and he had developed no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression . He looked at her from time to time as they ate , but her face was bent stubbornly over her food . " I 'm sorry , " she said , finally , as they were drinking their coffee , and her voice was surprisingly harsh , " I 'm sorry for the way I behaved . I know I should be gay and offhand and kiss the brave young soldier off . ' Go get your goddamn head shot off , darling , I 'll be waiting with a martini in my hand .. ' " " Peggy , " Michael said , " shut up . " " Wear my glove on your arm , " Peggy said , " as you do KP . " " What 's the matter , Peggy ? " Michael asked foolishly , because he knew what the matter was . " It 's just that I 'm so fond of wars , " said Peggy flatly . " Crazy about wars . " She laughed . " It would be awful if people were having a war and someone I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed . He felt weary now , and helpless , but he could n't help realizing that he would n't have liked it if Peggy was one of those patriotic women who jumped happily into the idea of the war , as into the arrangements for a wedding . " What do you want , Peggy ? " he said , thinking of the Army waitingimplacably for him at six-thirty the next morning , thinking of the other armies on both sides of the world waiting to kill him . " What do you want from me ? " " Nothing , " said Peggy . " You 've given me two precious years of your time . What more could a girl want ? Now go off and let them blow you up . I 'll hang a gold star outside the ladies ' room of the Stork Club . " The waiter was standing over them . " Anything else ? " he asked , smiling with an Italian fondness for prosperous lovers who ate expensivelunches . " Brandy for me , " said Michael . " Peggy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm perfectly happy . " The waiter backed off . If he had n't caught the boat at Naples , in 1920 , Michael thought , he 'd probably be in Libya today , rather than Oil 56th Street . " Do you want to know what I want to do this afternoon ? " Peggy asked harshly . " Yes . " " I want to go some place and get married . " She stared across thep248small , wine-stained table at him , angry and challenging . The girl at the next table , a full blonde in a red dress , was saying to the beaming white-haired man she was lunching with , " You must introduce me to your wife some day , Mr. Cawpowder . I 'm sure she 's absolutely charming . " " Did you hear me ? " Peggy demanded . " I heard you . " The waiter came over to the table and put the small glass down . " Only three more bottles left , " he said . " It is impossible to get any brandy these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unreasonably , he disliked the dark , friendly ; stupid face . " I 'll bet , " he said , " they have no trouble getting it in Rome . " The waiter 's face quivered , and Michael could almost hear him saying unhappily to himself , " Ah , here is another one who is blaming me for Mussolini . This war , oh , this sickness of a war . " " Yes , Sir , " the waiter said , smiling , " it is possible that you are right . " He backed away , trying to disclaim , by the tortured small movements of his hands and the sorrowful upper lip , that he had any responsibility for the Italian Army , the Italian Fleet , the Italian Air Force . " Well ? " Peggy said loudly . Michael sipped his brandy slowly , in silence . " O.K. , " said Peggy . " I catch on . " " I just do n't see the sense , " Michael said , " of getting married now . " " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just that I 'm tired of seeing single men get killed . " " Peggy . " Michael covered her hand softly with his . " This is n't at all like you . " " Maybe it is , " said Peggy . " Maybe all the other times were n't like me . Do n't think , " she said coldly , " you 're going to come back in five years with all your goddamn medals and find me waiting for you , with a welcoming smile on my face . " " O.K. , " Michael said wearily . " Let 's not talk about it . " " I 'm going to talk about it , " Peggy said . " O.K. , " said Michael . " Talk about it . " He could see her fighting back tears as her entire face dissolved and softened . " I was going to be very gay , " she said , her voice trembling . " Going to war ? Let 's have a drink . . . I would 've managedtoo , but that damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goingp249to forget you . There was another man , in Austria , and I thought I 'd remember him till the day I died . He was probably a better man than you , too , braver and more gentle , and a cousin of his wrote me last year from Switzerland that they 'd killed him in Vienna . I was going out to the theatre with you the night I got the letter , and first I thought , I ca n't go out tonight , ' but then you were at the door and I looked at you and I did n't really remember the other man at all . He was dead , but I did n't remember very much about him , although at one time I asked him to marry me , too . I seem to have terrible luck in that department , do n't I ? " " Stop it , " Michael whispered , " please , Peggy , stop it . " But Peggy went on , the mist of tears barely held back in the deep , remembering eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd probably have forgotten him even if we had been married , and I 'd probably forget you , if you stayed away long enough . Probably just a superstition on my part . I guess I feel if you 're married and it 's there , all settled and official , to come home to , you 'll come home . Ridiculous ... His name was Joseph . He had no home , nothing . So , naturally , they killed him . " She stood up abruptly . " Wait for me outside , " she said . " I 'll be right down . " She fled out of the small , dark room with the little bar near the window and the old-fashioned maps of the wine sections of France hung around the smoky walls . Michael left some money on the table for the bill , and a big tip to try to make up to the Italian waiter for being ugly to him , and walked slowly out into the street . IIe stood in front of the restaurant , thoughtfully smoking a cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wrong . I 'm not going to carry that burden , too , or let her carry it , either . If she was going to forgethim , that was merely another price you paid for the war , another form of casualty . It was not entered on the profit-and-loss balances of men killed and wounded and treasure destroyed , but it was just as surely a casualty . It was hopeless and crippling to try to fight it . Peggy came out . Her hair shone in the sun as though she had combed it violently upstairs , and her face was composed and smiling . " Forgive me , " she said , touching his arm . " I 'm just as surprised by it as you are . " " That 's all right , " Michael said . " I 'm no prize today myself . " " I did n't mean a word of what I said . You believe that , do n't you ? " " Of course , " said Michael.  | " Some other time , " Peggy said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's an interesting story . Especially for a soldier . " " Sure , " said Michael politely . " I 'd love to hear it . " " And now , " Peggy looked up the street and waved to a taxicab that was slowly coming down from Lexington Avenue , " I think I 'd better go back to work for the rest of the afternoon . Do n't you ? " " There 's no need . . . Peggy smiled at him . " I think it 's a good idea , " she said . " Then tonight , we 'll meet as though we never had lunch today at all . I 'd prefer it that way . You can find plenty of things to do this afternoon , ca n't you ? " " Of course , " Michael said . " Have a good time , darling . " She kissed him lightly . " And wear your gray suit tonight . " She got into the cab without looking back and the car drove loudly off toward Third Avenue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows of the L. Then he walked slowly west on the shady side of the street . Ile had put off thinking about Peggy , half consciously , half unconsciously . There were so many other things to think about . The war made a miser out of a man , he saved all his emotions for it . But that was no excuse , either . He still wanted to postpone thinking about her . IIe knew himself too well to imagine that for two , three , four years he could remain faithful to a photograph , a letter a month , a memory . . . And he did n't want to make any claims on her . They were two sensible , forthright , candid people , and here was a problem that millions of people all around then were facing one way or another , and they could n't handle it any better than the youngest , the most naive , the most illiterate backwoodsman come clown froi.i his hills to pick up a rifle , leaving his Cora Sue behind him .. . he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either that night or any night before the end of the war , but he knew that in the nights of memory and recapitulation ahead of him on continents he had never traveled before , he would suffer as he thought of this early summer afternoon and a bitter voice would cry within him , " Why did n't you do it ? Why not ? Why not ? " He shook his head to clear it , and walked with defiant briskness between the brown buildings , gracious and friendly in the spacious light . He passed an old man , walking painfully with a cane . The old man had a wool muffler on and a long , dark coat , although it was a warm clay . There were livermarks on the old man 's skin , and hisp251hands were yellow on his cane , and his eyes , as he looked at Michael , were watery and bitter , as though any young man briskly walking the streets was an affront to him , mufflered and limping on the edge of the grave . The look was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if perhaps the old man was known to him and was nursing a more personal injury . But the old man was a stranger , and Michael walked on , more slowly . Fool , Michael thought . You 've had the whole banquet , all the courses , the soup , the fish , the white wine , the red , the Burgundy and the Bordeaux , the game , the roast , the salad , the cheese , and now you 've come to the dessert and brandy , and because you 've found the sweet bitter and the drink harsh , you hate the men who have come more lately than you to the table . I 'd change with you , Old Man , Michael thought . The days you 've lived through . The best days of America . The optimistic days , the short wars , the little killing , the bracing , invigorating , early-century weather ... You married and sat down to dinner with many children in the same house for twenty uninterrupted years , and only foreigners fought in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't envy me . What good fortune , what a gift to be seventy and nearly dead in 1942 ! I pity you now because of your heavy cpat on the old bones , the warm wool around the frozen throat , the shaking hand on the necessary cane . . . but perhaps I should pity myself more . Warm as I am , with my steady hands , and my certain step . . . I will never freeze on a summer 's day , and my hand will never shake from age . I come to Intermission and I do not return to the ' Theatre for the Second Act . There was the crisp sound of high heels beside him and Michael looked at the woman who was passing him . She had on a wide straw hat with a deep green band and the light , thrown on her face through the brim , was softened and rosy . IIer dress was of a light , cool green and clung in nude , delightful wrinkles to her hips . She was bareleggedand brown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael 's polite but admiring glance . She passed him quickly and walked in front of him . Michael 's eyes lingered pleasantly on the trim , pretty figure and he smiled as her hand went inevitably up to her hair and patted it and arranged it in helpless , agreeable response to the fact that a young man was looking at her and finding her beautiful . Then Michael grinned . No , he thought , Old Man , I 've been mak/ing it all up . Go die , Old Man , with my blessing . I 'll sit the mealout with pleasure . He was whistling later in the afternoon as he approached the barwhere he was to meet Cahoon and say good-bye to him before he left for the wars.  |p253THIS  WHAT they said along the bar where they sold three-point-two beer in the PX at Fort Dix in the State of New Jersey on a night in the fateful , warm summer of 1942 . " I got one eye . Actually one eye . I told the bastidds and they said One A and here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am the father of a ten-year-old girl . You 're separated from your wife , they said , One A. The State is jumping with young single men without children and they persecuted me . " And they said , " In the old country , they wanted to draft you , you went to an expert and he ruptured you . One little pull of the finger and you had a hernia would keep you out of fifty wars . But in America they take one look and they say , Son , we 'll fix your balls just as good as new in two days . One A. ' " And they said , " You call this beer ? As soon as the government , tees in , everything stinks , even the beer . " And they said , " It 's a question of pull . You could beat Joe Louis in two rounds , and they 'd defer you for delicate health , you know somebodyon the draft board . " And they said , " I got ulcers so bad , every time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't show on the x-rays , they said , One A. They wo n't be satisfied till they have my life . I wonder will they bury me at Arlington Cemetery . They 'll send me a purple heart forp254hyperacidity and give me a military funeral and they can stuff it up their ass . I ai n't et any of their food yet , but I ca n't hold out forever . One of those meals , bologna and cheese and peanut butter they pass out , and they got a dead soldier on their hands . I warned them , but they said , One A. " And they said , " I do n't mind servin ' my country , but what I do n't like is they deduct twenty-two dollars a month and send it to my wife . I been separated from my wife eleven years , and she slept with every man and boy between here and Salt Lake , and they deduct twenty-two dollars . " And they said , " When I get out I 'm goin ' to go kill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to join the Coast Guards , my application is in , I like the sea , but he said , One A , you better learn to like the land . ' " And they said , " Listen to me , Bud , when you stand formation , stand in the middle . Not in the front , not in the back , not on the sides . In the middle , see . Then they do n't pick you for details , see . And stay away from your tent except at night , because they go around snoopin ' , and anybody they see on his back , they grab him and put him to work , unloadin ' trucks in the warehouses . " And they said , " I could have had a commission , only it would of taken a little time , and the draft board was hungry for me , red , raving hungry . " And they said , " Did you see those two guys marchin ' back and forth with full packs in front of the orderly room ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forth , back and forth , they must of walked two hundred miles by now . They went into Trenton for a couple of beers , and the Sergeant caught them , and they have in walk until they 're shipped . For a couple of glasses of beer . And they call this a free country . " And they said , " When they take you in front of the interviewer , you tell him you can type . Makes no difference can you type , ca n't you type . You tell him you can type . This Army is crazy for typists . One thing you can be sure , they do n't put typewriters any place where they can be shot at . You tell them you ca n't type , they put you in the Infantry and you can write home and tell your Ma to start shoppin ' for a nice gold star for the window . " And they said , " This Army pays more attention to a man 's instrumentthan a Spanish bride on a hot night on the Equator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've looked at it threep255times already . Who do they expect us to fight  --  the Japs or the field hockey team at Vassar ? " And they said , " They got all the ratings in the Air Force . " And they said , " You do n't get killed in the Artillery . " And they said , " This is the worst company at Fort Dix . They found the cook buggering a KP and they court-martialed him and reduced him to the rank of Staff Sergeant . " And they said , " This is the first night I 'll be sleeping away from my wife since 1931 . I do n't think I can manage it . " And they said , " Hey , look , they give you condoms for nothing in this joint . " And they said , " What do you know , you can buy the Bible for quarter . Paper covered . " And they said , " Oh , Christ , they 're closin ' up . " Michael walked down the spit-covered steps of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calm , starlit summer sky . Heavy with beer , in the stiff green fatigue suit that smelled like the back room of a haberdashery store , with his feet feeling clumsy and anchored in the new square shoes that already were blistering his heel , he moved down the company street between the tents , past t lie two sullen figures marching slowly back and forth under heavy packs in payment for the Trenton beers , past the crap game that had started yesterday and would go on until the men died or the Japanese surrendered , past the lonely , rumpled figures that stood next to the guy ropes looking soberly up at the dark sky , past the men packingt heir civilian clothes into bundles to give to the Red Cross , past the privates , first class , who did the actual work of running the company and who seemed like rare and lofty persons , endowed with incredible privileges , who were now calling hoarsely , " Lights out in ten minutes , Soldiers ! Lights out in ten minutes ! " He went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulb , and slowly undressed and got under the rough blanket in hisu underwear because he had been ashamed to go to war carrying pajamas . The man from Elmira , who slept next to the tent opening , put out the light . He had been there three weeks already because he was a veterinarian and the Army was trying to place him at a post where I could be useful with mules , and it was hard to find that many mules in this up-to-date war . The man from Elmira put out thep256light because he was the veteran of the establishment and naturally took command of matters like that . The man to the right of Michael was already snoring . He was a Sicilian who pretended he could read and write and he was going to wait here for ninety days to be made a citizen before the Army decided what it was going to do with him . The men in the other beds had communicated nothing to Michael . They lay in the darkness , listening to the Sicilian snore , listening to Taps weep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herded shabby acres of men who were no longer civilians and not yet soldiers , and who now , finally , in a generally loose and approximate way , were to be prepared to die . I 'm here , Michael thought , smelling the Army blanket under his chin , it 's happened . I should have rushed into it and I did n't and I could have dodged it and I did n't . Ilcre I am , in the tent , under the stiff blanket , as I always knew I would be . This tent , this blanket , these snoring men have been waiting for me for thirty-three years , and now they have caught up with me and I have caught up with them . The expiation has begun . I have begun to pay up . Pay for my opinions , pay for my easy life , for the good meals and the soft beds , Fay for the easy girls and all the easy money . Pay for the thirty-threeyearholiday that ended this morning when the Sergeant said , " You . Pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drift off to sleep , although there were shouts and whistles and drunken weeping all about him . And he slept without dreams all that night.  |p257HE  GENERAL had come down to inspect the line , exuding confidence , so they all knew something was up . Even the Italian General in the party of ten bulky , binoculared , goggled , scarved , glittering officers had exuded confidence , so they knew it was something big . The General had been particularly hearty , laughing uproariouslywhen he talked to the soldiers , patting them heavily on the shoulder , even pinching the cheek of an eighteen-year-old boy who had just come up as a replacement in Himmler 's squad . This was a certain sign that a great many men were going to be killed , one way or another , very soon . There were other signs , too . Himmler , who had been at Divisional Headquarters two days ago , had heard on the radio that the British had been burning papers again at their headquarters in Cairo . The British seemed to have an unlimited number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then again in August , and here it was October , and they were still burning them . Ilimmler had also heard the man on the radio say that the overall strategy was for them to break through to Alexandria and Jerusalem and finally to join up with the Japanese in India . It was true that this seemed a little grandiose and ambitious to men who had been sitting in the same place in the bitter sun for months , but there was a reassuring sound to the plan . At least it gave evidence that the General had a plan.  |p258The  night was very quiet . Occasionally there was a random small rattle of fire , or a flare , but that was all . There was a moon and the pale sky , crusted with the mild glitter of the stars , blended gently with the shadowy expanse of the desert . Christian stood alone , loosely holding the machine pistol in the crook of his arm , looking out toward the anonymous shadows behind which lay the enemy . There was no sound from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of men all about him . Night had its advantages . You could move around quite freely , without worrying that some Englishman had you in his glasses and was debating with himself whether or not you were worth a shell or two . Also , the smell died down . The smell was the salient fact about war in the desert . There was not enough water for anything but drinking , and not enough for that , and nobody bathed . You sweated all day , in the same clothes , week in and week out , and your clothes rotted with it , and became stiff on your back , and you had a steady rash of prickly heat that itched and burned , but your nose suffered worst of all . The human race was only bearable when the obscene juices of living were being constantly washed away . You became dulled to your own smell , of course , otherwise you would kill yourself , but when you joined any group , the smell hit you , in a solid , jolting attack . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solace since he had arrived in Africa . They had been winning , it was true , and he had marched from Bardia to this spot , some seventy miles from Alexandria . But somehow , while agreeable , victory did not have a personal quality to a soldier in the line . No doubt victory meant a great deal to the well-uniformed officers at the various headquarters and they probably celebrated over large dinners with wines and beer when towns were taken , but victories for you still meant that there was a good chance that you would die in the morning , and that you would still live in a shallow , gritty hole , and that the other men who lived by your side would stink just as unbearably in the hot wind of triumph as in defeat . The only good time had been the two weeks in Cyrene , when he had been sent back with malaria . It had been cooler there , and green , and there was swimming in the Mediterranean . When Himmler had reported that he had heard the expert on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Staff was to go through Alexandria and Cairo to join up in India with the Japanese ,  |p259Knuhlen  , who had come out with a recent draft of replacements , and who had taken over some of Himmler 's old position of comedian to the company , had said , " Anybody who wants can go join up with the Japs . Myself , if nobody minds , I 'll stop in Alexandria and join up with some of that Italian ass I hear they have running all over the streets there . " Christian grinned in the darkness as he remembered Knuhlen 's rough witticism . There are probably few jokes , he thought , being told tonight on the other side of the minefield . Then there was the flash for a hundred miles , and a second later , the sound . He fell to the sand , just as the shells exploded all around him . He opened his eyes . It was dark , but he knew he was moving and he knew that he was not alone , because there was the smell . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the winter clothes of the children of the poor . He remembered the sound of the shells over his head , and he closed his eyes again . It was a truck . There was no doubt about that . And somewhere the war was still on , because there was the sound of artillery , going and coming , not very far off . And something bad had happened , because a voice in the darkness near him was weeping and saying between sobs , " My name is Richard Knuhlen , my name is Richard Knuhlen , " over and over again , as though the man were trying to prove to himself that he was a normal fellow who knew exactly who the was and what he was doing : Christian stared up in the opaque darkness at the heavy-smelling canvas that swayed and jolted above him . The bones of his arms and legs felt as though they had been broken . His ears felt smashed against head , and for awhile he lay on the board floor in the complete blackness contemplating the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Knuhlen , " the voice said , " and I live at Number 3 , Carl Ludwig Strasse . My name is Richard Knuhlen and I live at ... " " Shut up , " Christian said , and immediately felt much better . He ( en tried to sit up , but that was too ambitious , and he lay back . gain , to watch the sky-rocketing waves of color under his eyelids . The weeping stopped , and somebody said , " We are going to join up with the Japanese . And I know where . " And laughed wildly again and again . " In Rome ! " the voice said , laughing . " On Benito 's balconyp260in Rome . I have to tell that expert that , " and then Christian realized that it was Himmler talking , and he remembered a great deal of what had happened in the last ten days . The barrage had been bad the first night , but everyone was fairly well dug in , and only Meyer and Heiss had been hit . There had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind them , and small gasoline fires before them where the Tommies were trying to mark a path through the minefield for the tanks and infantry behind the barrage , small dark figures appearing in sudden flashes , busily jumping around so far away . Their own guns had started in behind them . Only one tank had got close . Every gun within a thousand meters of them had opened up on it . When the hatch was opened a minute later they saw with surprise that the man who tried to climb out was burning brightly . The whole attack on their sector , after the barrage died down , had only lasted two hours , three waves with nothing more to show for it than seven immobile tanks , charred , with broken treads , at aggressiveangles in the sand , and many bodies strewn peacefully around them . Everybody had been pleased . They had only lost five men in the company , and Hardenburg had grinned widely when he went back to battalion to report in the quiet of the morning . But at noon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like a whole company of tanks had appeared in the minefield , jiggling uncertainly in the swirling dust and sand . This time the line had been overrun , but the British infantry had been stopped before it reached them , and what was left of the tanks had pulled back , turningmaliciously from time to time to rake them before rumbling out of range . And before they could take a deep breath , the British artillery had opened on them again . It had caught the medical parties out in the open , tending the wounded . They were all screaming and dying and no one could leave his hole to help them . That was probablywhen Knuhlen had begun to cry and Christian remembered thinking , dazedly and somehow surprised : They are very serious about this . Then he had begun to shake . He had braced himself crazily with his hands rigid against the sides of the hole he was in . When he looked over the rim of the hole there seemed to be thousands of Tommies running at him and blowing up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among them in eccentric lines , their machine guns going , and he had felt like standing upp261and saying , " You are making a serious mistake . I am suffering from malaria and I am sure you would not like to be guilty of killing an invalid . " It went on for many days and nights , with the fever coming and going , and the chills in the middle of the desert noon , and from time to time you thought with dull hostility : They never told you it could last so long and they never told you you would have malaria while it was happening . Then , somehow , everything died down , and he thought : We are still here . Were n't they foolish to try it ? He fell asleep , kneeling in the hole . One second later Hardenburg was shaking him and peering down into his face , saying , " Goddamn you , are you still alive ? " He tried to answer , but his teeth were shaking crazily in his jaws and his eyes would n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by the collar and dragged him like a sack of potatoes along the ground as he nodded gravely at the bodies lying on both sides . He was surprised to see that it was quite dark and a truck was standing there , with its motor going , and he said , quite loudly , " Keep it quiet there . " The man beside him was sobbing and saying , " My name is Richard Knuhlen , " and much later , on the dark board floor under the smelly canvas , in all the heavy , bone-shaking jolting , he was still crying and still saying it over and over again , " My name is Richard Knuhlen and I live at Number 3 Carl Ludwig Strasse . " When he finally really woke up and saw that perhaps he was not going to die at the moment and realized that he was in full retreat and still had malaria , he thought , abstractedly : I would like to see the General now . I wonder if he is still confident . Then the truck stopped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Everybody ! " Slowly the men moved toward the rear of the truck , heavily , as though they were walking in thick mud . Two or three of them fell when they jumped down over the tailboard and just lay there uncomplaininglyas other men jumped and fell on them . Christian was the last one out of the truck . I am standing , he thought with deliberatetriumph . I am standing . Hardenburg looked at him queerly in the moonlight . Off to both ides there was the flash of guns and there was a general rumble in the air , but the small victory of having landed correctly made everythingseem quite normal for the moment . Christian looked keenly at the men struggling to their feet andp262standing in sleepwalking poses around him . He recognized very few of them , but perhaps their faces would come back to him in daylight . " Where 's the company ? " he asked . " This is the company , " Hardenburg said . His voice was unrecognizable . Christian had a sudden suspicion that someone was impersonatingthe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go into the matter more deeply when things became more settled . Hardenburg put out his hand and pushed roughly at Christian 's face with the heel of his palm . His hand smelled of grease and gunoiland the sweat of his cuff . Christian pulled back a little , blinking . " Are you all right ? " Hardenburg said . " Yes , Sir , " he said . " Perfectly , Sir . " He would have to think about where the rest of the company was , but that would wait until later , too . The truck started to slither into movement on the sandy track , and two of the men trotted heavily after it . " Stand where you are ! " Hardenburg said . The men stopped and stood there , staring at the truck , which gathered speed and wound loudly over the shining sand toward the west . They were at the bottom of a small rise . They stood in silence and watched the truck climb , with a clashing of bearings , past Hardenburg 's motorcycle , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment , huge , rolling , home-like , then disappeared on the other side . " We dig in here , " Hardenburg said , with a stiff wave of his handto the white glitter of the rise . The men stared stupidly at it . " Right now , " Hardenburg said . " Diestl , " he said , " stay with me . " " Yes , Sir , " said Christian , very smart . He went over to Hardenburg , elated with the fact that he could move . Hardenburg started up the rise with what seemed to Christian superhuman briskness . Amazing , he thought dully , as he followed the Lieutenant , a thin , slight man like that , after the last ten days .. . The men followed slowly . With rigid gestures of his arm , Hardenburgindicated to each of them where they should dig in . There were thirty-seven of them and Christian remembered again that he must inquire later what had happened to the rest of the company . Harden burg stretched them out very thin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way up the rise . When he had finished he and Christian turned and looked back at the bent slow figures digging in . Christian suddenly realized that if they were attacked they would have to standp263where they were , because there was no possibility of retreating up the exposed slope from the line where Hardenburg had set them . Then he began to realize what was happening . " All right , Diestl , " Hardenburg said . " You come with me . " Christian followed the Lieutenant back to the track . Without a word , he helped Hardenburg push the motorcycle up the track to the top of the rise . Occasionally a man would stop digging and turn and peer thoughtfully at the two men working the motorcycle slowly up to the crest of the slope behind them . Christian was panting heavily when they finally stopped pushing the machine . He turned , with Hardenburg , and looked down at the sliver of a line of toiling men below him . The scene looked peaceful and unreal , with the moon and the empty desert and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the Bible . " They 'll never be able to fall back , " he said , almost unconsciously , " once they 're engaged . " " That 's right , " Hardenburg said flatly . " They 're going to die there , " said Christian . " That 's right , " said Hardenburg . Then Christian remembered something Hardenburg had said to him as far back as El Agheila . " In a bad situation that must be held as long as possible , the intelligentofficer will place his men so that they have no possibility of retreat . If they are placed so that they must either fight or die , the officer has done his job . " Tonight Hardenburg had done his job quite well . " What happened ? " Christian asked . Iardenburg shrugged . " They broke through on both sides of us . " " Where arc they now ? " Hardenburg looked wearily at the flash of gunfire to the south and the flicker farther off to the north . " You tell me , " - he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the motorcycle . " Enough for a hundredkilometers , " he said . " Are you well enough to hold on in back ? " Christian wrinkled his forehead , trying to puzzle this out , then slowly managed to do it , " Yes , Sir , " he said . Ile turned and looked it the stumbling , sinking line of figures down the hill , the men whomc was going to leave to die there . For a moment , he thought of sat ing to Hardenburg , " No , Sir , I will stay here . " But really , nothing mild be gained by that . A war had its own system of balances , and he knew that it was tort cowardice on Hardenburg 's part , or self-seeking on his own , top264pull back and save themselves for another day . These men would fight a small , pitiful action , perhaps delay a British company for an hour or so on the bare slope , and then vanish . If he and Ilardenburg stayed , they would not be able , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes more than that hour . That was the way it was . Perhaps the next time it would be himself left on a hill without hope and another on the road back to problematical safety . " Stay here , " Hardenburg said . " Sit down and rest . I 'll go and tell them we 're going back to find a mortar platoon to support us . " " Yes , Sir , " said Christian and sat down suddenly . He watched Hardenburg slide briskly down toward where Himmler was slowly digging . Then he fell sideways and was asleep before his shoulder touched the ground . Hardenburg was shaking him roughly . He opened his eyes and looked up . He knew that it would be impossible to sit up , then stand up , then take one step after another . He wanted to say , " Please leave me alone , " and drop off again to sleep . But Hardenburg grabbed him by his coat , at his neck , and pulled hard . Somehow Christian found himself standing . He walked automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron over stiff and frozen laundry at home , and helped Hardenburg move the motorcycle . Hardenburg swung his leg over the saddle with great agility and began kicking the starting pedal . The machine sputtered again and again , but it did not start . Christian watched him working furiously with the machine in the waning , dry moonlight . It was n't until the figure was close to him that Christian looked up and realized that they were being watched . It was Knuhlen , the man who had been weeping in the truck , who had stopped shoveling and had followed the Lieutenant up the slope . Knuhlen did n't say anything . He just stood there , watching blankly as Hardenburg kicked again and again at the pedal . Hardenburg saw him . He took a slow , deep breath , swung his leg back and stood next to the machine . " Knuhlen , " he said , " get back to your post . " " Yes , Sir , " said Knuhlen , but he did n't move . Hardenburg walked over to Knuhlen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his fist . Knuhlen 's nose began to bleed . He made a wet , snuffling sound , but he did not move . His hands hung at his sides as though he had no further use for them . He had left his rifle and his entrenching tool at the hole he had been digging down the slope . Hardenburg stepped back and looked curiously and withoutp265malice at Knuhlen , as though he represented a small problem in engineering that would have to be solved in due time . Then Hardenburgstepped over to him again and hit him very hard twice . Knuhlen fell slowly to his knees . He kneeled there looking blankly up at Hardenburg . " Stand up ! " Hardenburg said . Slowly Knuhlen stood up . He still did not say anything and his hands still hung limply at his hips . Christian looked at him vaguely . Why do n't you stay down ? he thought , hating the baggy , ugly soldier standing there in silent , longing reproach on the crest of the moonlit rise . Why do n't you ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back down that hill . " But Knuhlen just stood there , as though words no longer entered the channels of his brain . Occasionally he sucked in some of the blood dripping into his mouth . The noise was surprising coming from that bent , silent figure . This was like some of the modern paintingsChristian had seen in Paris . Three haggard , silent , dark figures on an empty hill under a dying moon , with sky and land cold and dark and almost of the same mysterious glistening , unearthly substanceall around . " All right , " Hardenburg said , " come with me . " Ile took the motorcycle handlebars and trundled it down the other side of the rise away from the shovelers below . Christian took a last look at the thirty-six men scraping at the desert 's face in their doped , rhythmic movements . Then he followed Hardenburg and Knuhlen along the down-sloping path . Knuhlen walked in a dumb , scuffling manner , behind the rolling motorcycle . They walked about fifty meters in silence . Then Hardenburgstopped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian took the handlebars and balanced the machine against his legs . Knuhlen had stopped and was standing in the sand , staring patiently once more at the Lieutenant . Ilardenburg cleared his throat as though he were going to make a speech , then walked up to Knobkit , looked at him deliberately , and clubbed him twice , savagely and quickly , across the eyes . Knuhlen sat down backwards this time , without a sound , and remained that way , staring up dully and tenaciously at the Lieutenant . Hardenburg looked down at him thoughtfully , then took out his pistol and cocked it . Knuhlen made no move and there was no change on the dark , bloody face in the dim light.  |p266Hardenburg  shot him once . Knuhlen started to get up to his feet slowly , using his hands to help him . " My dear Lieutenant , " he said in a quiet , conversational tone . Then he slid face down into the sand . Hardenburg put his pistol away . " All right , " he said . Then he came back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He kicked the pedal . This time it started . " Get on , " he said to Christian . Carefully , Christian swung his leg over and settled himself on the pillion seat of the motorcycle . The machine throbbed jumpily under him . " Hold on tight , " Hardenburg said . " Around my middle . " Christian put his arms around Hardenburg . Very strange , he thought , hugging an officer at a time like this , like a girl going for an outing into the woods with a motorcycle club on a Sunday afternoon . So close , Hardenburg smelled frightfully , and Christian was afraid he was going to vomit . Hardenburg put the machine into gear and it sputtered and roared and Christian wanted to say , " Please keep quiet , " because something like this should be done quietly , and it was discourteous to the thirtysevenmen who had to stay behind to advertise so blatantly that they were being left alone to die and that other men would still be alive when they were bleached bones on the hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian thought , remembering the laborious small pits facing the British , facing the tanks and the armored cars . Three dozen . Three dozen soldiers , he thought , holding tight to the Lieutenanton the jolting machine , trying to remember not to have an attack of fever or chills , three dozen soldiers , at how much a dozen .. . Hardenburg reached a level place , and he accelerated the motor . They sped across the empty plain glowing in the last level rays of the sinking moon , surrounded by the flicker of guns on all horizons . Their speed created a great deal of wind , and Christian 's cap blew off , but he did not mind , because the wind also made it impossible to smell the Lieutenant any more . They rode north and west for a half hour . The flickering on the horizon grew stronger and brighter as the motorcycle slithered along the winding track among the dunes and the occasional patches of scrub grass . There were some burnt-out tanks along the track , and here and there a cannibalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an anti-aircraft gun . There were some new graves , obviously hastily dug , with a rifle , bayonet-down in the ground , and a cap or helmet hanging from the butt , and there were the usual crashed planes , blackened and wind-ripped , with the bent propellers and the broken wings vaguely reflecting glints of the moon from their ragged metal surfaces . But it was n't until they reached a road considerably to the north , running almost due west , that they met up with any other troops . Then they suddenly were in a long regimentalconvoy of trucks , armored cars , scout cars , carriers and other motorcycles , moving slowly along the narrow track , in overpowering clouds of dust and exhaust fumes . Hardenburg pulled off to one side , but not too far , because there was no telling , with all the fighting that had gone back and forth over this ground , where you might run over a mine . He stopped the motorcycle and Christian nearly dropped off with the tension of speed no longer holding him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadying him . " Thank you , " Christian said formally and light-headedly . He was having a chill now , and his jaws were clamped in a cold spasm around his swollen ' tongue . " You can get into one of those trucks , " Hardenburg shouted , wavingwith a ridiculous expenditure of energy , to the procession slowly droning past . " But I do n't think you should . " " Whatever you say , Lieutenant . " Christian smiled with frozen amiability , like a drunk at a polite and rather boring garden party . " I do n't know what their orders are , " Hardenburg shouted , " and they may have to turn off and fight at any moment . . . " " Of course , " said Christian . " It 's a good idea to hold onto our own transportation , " Hardenburgsaid . Christian was vaguely grateful that the Lieutenant was being so kind about explaining everything to him . " Yes , " said Christian , " yes , indeed . " " What did you say ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . . . " Christian hesitated . He did not remember what he had said . " I am agreeable , " he said , nodding ambiguously . " Absolutely ugrecable . " " Good , " said Hardenburg . He unknotted the handkerchief that Christian had around his throat . " Better put this around your face . For the dust . " He started to tie it behind Christian 's head.  |p268Christian  put his hands up slowly and pushed the Lieutenant 's hands away . " Pardon me , " he said , " for a moment . " Then he leaned over and vomited . The men in the trucks going by did not look at him or the Lieutenant . They merely stared straight ahead as though they were riding in a wintry parade in a dying man 's dream , without interest , curiosity , destinat on , hope . Christian straightened up . He felt much better , although the taste in his mouth was considerably worse than it had been before . He put the handkerchief up around over the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of his face . His fingers worked heavily on the knot in back , but finally he made it . " I am ready , " he announced . Hardenburg had his handkerchief around his face by this time . Christian put his arms around the Lieutenant 's waist , and the motorcyclekicked and spun in the sand and jolted into the procession behind an ambulance with three pairs of legs showing through the torn door . Christian felt very fond of the Lieutenant , sitting iron-like on the seat in front of him , looking , with his handkerchief mask , like a bandit in an American Western movie . I ought to do something , Christian thought , to show him my appreciation . For five minutes , in the shaking dust , he tried to think of how he could demonstrate his gratitude to the Lieutenant . Slowly , the idea came to him . I will tell him , Christian thought , about his wife and myself . That is all I have to offer . Christian shook his head . Silly , he thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the idea , he could not escape it . He closed his eyes ; he tried to think of the thirty-six men digging slowly in the sand to the south ; he tried to think of all the beer and cold wine and ice water he had drunk in the last five years , but again and again he felt himself on the verge of shouting over the clanking of the traffic around him , " Lieutenant , I had your wife when I went on leave from Rennes . " The procession stopped , and Hardenburg , who had decided to remain , for safety , in the middle of the convoy , put his foot down and balanced the machine in neutral . Now , thought Christian crazily , now I am going to tell him . But at that moment , two men got out of the ambulance in front of them and dragged a body out by the feet and put it down by the side of the road . They movedp269heavily and wearily and dragged it by the ankles out of the way of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his handkerchief . The two men looked up guiltily . " He is not alive , " one of the men said earnestly , corning over to Christian . " What 's the sense of carrving him if he is not alive ? " Then the convoy started and the ambulance ground into first speed . The two men had to run , their water bottles flapping against their hips , and they were dragged for quite a distance before they managed to scramble into the body of the ambulance over the other legs jetting out through the torn door . Then it was too noisy to tell Hardenburg about his wife . It was hard to remember when the firing started . There was a tagged crackling near the head of the column and the vehicles stopped . Then Christian realized that he had been hearing the noise for what seemed like a long time without understanding what it was . Men jumped heavily from the thin-skinned vehicles and scattered into the desert on both sides of the road . A wounded man fell out of the ambulance and crawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless leg , to a little clump of grass ten meters to the light . He lay there , busily hollowing out a little space in front of him with his hands . Machine guns started all around them and the armored vehicles swung without any recognizable plan to both sides and opened fire wildly , in all directions . A man without a cap walked swiftly up and down near them alongside the deserted trucks , with their motors still going , bellowing , " Answer it ! Answer it , you bastards . " He was bald and capless and his dome shone whitely in the moonlight . He was waving a swagger stick insanely in the air . He must be at least a colonel , Christian thought . Mortar shells were dropping sixty meters away . A fire started in one of the carriers there . In the light Christian could see amen being dragged roughly away from the road . Hardenburg drove the motorcyclealongside the ambulance and stopped it . He peered sharply across the desert , the little v of the handkerchief whipping around his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracers in their machine guns and light artillery now . The lazy , curving streaks were sweeping in , seeming to gather speed as they neared the convoy . It was impossible for Christianto figure out where they were firing from . It is very disorderly , he thought reproachfully , it is impossible to fight under ridiculous conditions like this . He started to get off the motorcycle . He wouldP270merely walk away from this and lie down and wait for something to happen to him . " Stay on here ! " Hardenburg shouted , although he was only twelve inches away from him . More disorder , Christian thought , resentfully sitting back on the pillion . He felt for his gun but he did not remem- ber what he had done with it . There was an acrid , biting smell of disinfectant coming from the ambulance , mixed with the smell of the dead . Christian began to cough . A shell whistled in and hit nearby and Christian ducked against the metal side of the ambulance . A moment later he felt a tap on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ing a hot spent fragment of shrapnel from his shoulder . In reaching back , he found his gun slung over his shoulder . He was heavily trying to disentangle it when Hardenburg kicked the machine into nerve  --  ment . Christian nearly fell off . The barrel of the gun hit him under the chin and he bit his tongue and tasted the blood , salty and hot , from the cut his teeth had made . He clung to Hardenburg . The motorcycle careened off among the crouching figures and the noise and the intermittent explosions . A stream of tracers from a great distance arched toward them . Hardenburg held the bucking machine on a straight course under the tracers and they pulled out of the glare of the flaming trucks . " Very disorderly , " Christian murmured . Then he got angry with Hardenburg . If he wanted to go riding into the British Army , let him do it . Why did he have to drag Christian with him ? Craftily , Christiandecided to fall off the machine . He tried to pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught on a protruding strip of metal and he could n't lift his knee . Vaguely , ahead of them , and to one side , he saw the dark outlines of tanks . Then the tanks swung their guns around . A machine gun from one of the turrets opened on them , and there was the sickening whistle as the bullets screamed behind their heads . Christian bent down and pressed his head crookedly against the Lieutenant 's shoulder . The Lieutenant was wearing a leather harness and the buckles scraped against Christian 's cheekbone . The machine gun swung around again . This time the bullets were hitting in front of them , knocking up puffs of moonlit dust , and bouncing up witli thick savage thuds . Then Christian began to cry , clinging to the Lieutenant , and lie knew he was afraid , and that he could do nothing to save himselfp271and they would be hit and he and the Lieutenant and the motorcyclewould crash in a single , smoking mass , burnt cloth and blood and gasoline in a dark pool on the sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waving wildly nearby . Hardenburg was grunting and bending over more than ever . Then the whistles came from behind them , and suddenly they were alone on a pale streak of road , with the noise-dying down far to the rear . Finally , Christian stopped crying . He sat up straight when Hardenburgsat up , and he even managed to look with some interest at the open road peeling out in front of the bouncing motorcycle . His mouth tasted very queer , with the vomit and the blood , and his cheek was stinging him as sand flew up under his handkerchief and ground into the bruises there . But he took a deep breath , feeling much better . For a moment , he did not even feel tired . Behind him the glare and the firing died down quickly . In five minutes they seemed to have the desert to themselves , all the long , quiet , moonlit waste from the Sudan to the Mediterranean , from Alamein to Tripoli . He held Hardenburg affectionately . He remembered that he had wanted to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the moment , what he had intended to say escaped him . He took the handkerchief off his face and looked around him and felt the wind whipping the spit out of the corners of his mouth , and he felt quite happy and at peace with the world . Hardenburg was a strange man , but Christian knew he could depend upon him to get him some place safely . Just where he would get him and at what time , Christian did not know , but there was no need to worry . Flow lucky it was that Captain Mueller , in command of their company , had been killed . If he had been alive it would have been Mueller and Hardenburg on the motorcycle now , and Christian would still be back on that hill with the three dozen other dead men .. . He breathed deeply of the dry , rushing air . He was sure now that he was going to live , perhaps even for quite a long time . Hardenburg handled the motorcycle very well , and they covered a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but steadily going north and west with the sky behind them lightening in the pink streaks of dawn . The road and the desert were empty except for the usual wreckage , all picked neat and clean by the salvage battallions . There was still the noise of firing behind them , but faraway ,  |p272moaning  and re-echoing in eccentric rhythms , dying down for minutes at a time . The sun came up . Hardenburg , now that he could see , increased the speed of the machine , and Christian had to concentrate to hold on . " Are you sleepy ? " Hardenburg asked , talking loudly , turning his head so that Christian could hear him over the cough of the engine . " A little , " Christian admitted . " Not too bad . " " You 'd better talk to me , " Hardenburg said . " I nearly fell asleep just now . " " Yes , Sir , " said Christian . He opened his mouth as if to say something , but closed it again . He tried to prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blank . " Go ahead , " shouted Hardenburg irritably . " Talk ! " " Yes , Sir , " said Christian . Then , helplessly . " About what ? " " Anything . The weather . " Christian looked around at the weather . It was the same weather they had had for six months . " It 's going to be a hot day , " Ire said . " Louder , " shouted Hardenburg , looking straight ahead . " I ca n't hear you . " " I said it 's going to be a hot day , " Christian screamed into the Lieutenant 's ear . " That 's better , " Hardenburg said . " Yes . Very hot . " Christian tried to think of another subject . " Come on , " Hardenburg said impatiently . " What else would you like to talk about ? " Christian asked . Ilk mind felt drugged and incapable of this exhausting intellectual effort . " Good God ! Anything ! Did you go to the Greek whorehouse they set up in Cyrene ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Flow was it ? " " I do n't know , " said Christian . " I waited in line and they closed up three men in front of me . " " Did anybody you know go ? " Christian thought hard . " Yes , " he said , " a Corporal with a head wound . " " How did he like it ? " Christian tried to remember . " I think he said the Greek girls were not much . They had no spirit . Also , " Christian remembered now , " he said it was too official . He had difficulty managing it under theP273time limit . And the gin did n't do anything . Just lay there . He thought the Army ought to get volunteers , not just anybody they can put their hands on . " " Your friend is an idiot , " Hardenburg said viciously . " Yes , Sir , " said Christian . He fell silent . " Come on . " Hardenburg waved his head sharply , as though to clear his eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Berlin ? " " I went to the opera , " Christian said promptly , " and I went to the concerts . " " You 're an idiot , too . " " Yes , Sir , " said Christian , thinking , warily , he is getting terribly light-headed . " Any girls in Berlin ? " " Yes , Sir . " Christian thought carefully . " I met a girl who worked in an airplane factory . " " Did you have an affair with her ? " " Yes . " " How was it ? " " Excellent , " Christian said loudly , peering anxiously out across the Lieutenant 's bent head at the desert stretching in a growing glitter ahead of them . " Good , " said the Lieutenant . " What was her name ? " " Marguerite , " said Christian , after a slight hesitation . " Was she married ? " " I do n't think so , " Christian said . " She did n't say . " " Sluts , " Hardenburg said , addressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Alexandria ? " No , Sir , " said Christian . " I was looking forward to going there , " said Hardenburg . " I do n't think we 'll ever get there now , " Christian said . " Keep quiet ! " shouted Hardenburg . The motorcycle took an larming twist before he righted it . " We 'll get there ! Do you hear c ! I said we 'll get there ! And get there soon ! Do you hear me ? " " Yes , Sir , " shouted Christian into the wind streaming back acrossc Lieutenant 's head . The Lieutenant twisted in his seat . His face was contorted andIN eyes gleamed between the crusted lids . His mouth was open andteeth were a garish white against the black lips . " I order you tokeep quiet ! " he shouted insanely , as though he were on a windy drillp274field , disciplining a full company of raw troops . " Keep your goddamn mouth shut or I 'll ... " Then the handlebars jerked to one side . The front wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grips . Christian felt himself falling and lunged forward , grasping the Lieutenant . The impact knocked the Lieutenant over the bucking front wheel and the machine skidded crazily off the track , the engine roaring loudly . Suddenly it dipped to one side and crashed . Christian felt himself flying through the air , screaming , but somewhere inside of him a voice was saying quietly , This is too much , too much . Then he hit and he felt a numbness in his shoulder , but he got up to one knee . The Lieutenant was lying under the motorcycle , whose front wheel was still spinning . The back wheel was a mass of twisted junk . The Lieutenant was lying quietly , blood spurting from a gash in his forehead , with his legs at a very queer angle under the machine . Christian walked slowly over to him , and started pulling at him . But that did n't work . So he laboriously lifted the motorcycle and toppled it over to the other side , away from Hardenburg . Then he sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took out his first-aid kit and put a bandage clumsily over the blood on the Lieutenant 's forehead . It looked very neat and professional for a moment . But then the blood came through and it looked like all the other bandages he had ever seen . Suddenly the Lieutenant sat up . He looked once at the machine , and said , crisply , " Now we walk . " But when he tried to get up he could n't . He looked at his legs reflectively . " Nothing serious , " he said , as though to convince himself . " I assure you , it is nothing serious . Are you all right ? " " Yes , Sir , " said Christian . " I think , " said the Lieutenant , " I had better rest for ten minutes . Then we shall see . " He lay back with his hands clutching the sodden bandage over his forehead . Christian sat next to him . He watched the front wheel of the motorcycle slowly stop spinning . It had been making a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the wheel stopped , there was no more sound . No sound from the motorcycle , no sound from the Lieutenant , no sound from the desert , no sound from the armies intertwined with each other somewhere else on the con tinent . The face of the desert looked fresh and cool in the new sun . Evenp275the wrecks looked simple and harmless in the fresh light . Christian slowly uncorked his canteen . He drank one mouthful of water carefully , rolling it around on his tongue and teeth before swallowing it . The sound of his swallowing was loud and wooden . Hardenburg opened one eye to see what he was doing . " Save your water , " he said automatically . " Yes , Sir , " said Christian , thinking with admiration : That man would give an order to the devil who was shoveling him through the door of the furnace in hell . Hardenburg , he thought , what a triumph of German military education . Orders spurted from him like blood from an artery . At his last gasp he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally Hardenburg sighed and sat up . He patted the wet bandage on his head . " Did you put this on ? " he asked . " Yes , Sir . " " It will fall off the first time I move , " Hardenburg said coldly , objectively criticizing , without anger . " Where did you learn to put on bandages ? " " Sorry , Sir , " said Christian . " I must have been a bit shaken myself . " " I suppose so , " Hardenburg said . " Still , it 's silly to waste a bandage . " He opened his tunic and took out an oilskin case . From the case he took a sharply folded terrain map . He spread the map on the desert floor . " Now , " he said , " we see where we are . " Wonderful , Christian thought , fully equipped for all eventualities . Hardenburg blinked from time to time as he studied the map . He grimaced with pain as he held the bandage on . But he figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put it back briskly into the case and carefully tucked it away inside his tunic . " Very well , " he said . " This track joins with another one , leading west , perhaps eight kilometers away . Do you think you can make it ? " " Yes , Sir , " said Christian . " How about you ? " Hardenburg looked at him disdainfully . " Do n't worry about me . On your feet , " he barked , again to the phantom company he was continually addressing . Christian rose slowly . His shoulder and arm pained considerably , and he could move the arm only with difficulty . But he knew he could walk several of the eight kilometers , if not all of them . He witched Hardenburg push himself up from the sand with a furious effort . The sweat broke out on his face and the blood began to come through the bandage on his forehead again . But when Christianp276leaned over to try to help him , Hardenburg glared at him , and said , " Get away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched Hardenburg struggle to raise himself . He dug his heels into the grainy sand as though getting ready to take the shock of being hit by an onrushing giant . Then , with his right elbow held rigid , he pushed ferociously , with cold purpose , at the ground . Slowly , inch by inch , with the pain shouting mutely from his livid face , he raised himself till he was half-bent over , but off the ground . With a wrench , he pulled himself upright and stood there , wavering , but erect , the sweat and blood nixed with the grime on his face in a thick , alarming compost . He was weeping , Christian noticed with surprise , the tears making harsh lines down the nameless paste on his cheeks . His breath came hard , in dry , tortured sobs , but he set his teeth . In a grotesque , clumsy movement , he faced north . " All right , " he said . " Forward march . " He started out along the thick sand of the track , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bobbed crazily to one side as he walked , but he continued steadily , without looking back . Christian followed him . He was feverishly thirsty . The gun slung over his shoulder seemed maliciously heavy , but he resolved not to drink or ask for a rest until Hardenburg did so first . They shuffled slowly , in a broken , deliberate tandem , across the sand , among the occasional rusting wrecks , toward the road to the north where other Germans might be beating their way back from the battle . Or where the British might be waiting for them . Christian thought impersonally and calmly about the British . They did not seem real or menacing . Only two or three things were real at the moment : the coppery taste in his throat , like sour brewery mash , the crippled , animal-like gait of Hardenburg before him , the sun rising higher and higher and with increasing , malevolent heat , behind their backs . If the British were waiting on the track that was a problem that would have to be solved in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now . They were sitting down for the second rest , stunned , sun-lacerated , their eyes dull with agony and fatigue , when they saw the car on the horizon . It was coming fast , with a swirl of dust like a plume behind it . In two minutes they saw that it was a smart open staff car , and a moment later they realized it was Italian . Hardenburg pushed himself up with a bone-cracking effort . Ilep277limped slowly out into the middle of the track and stood there , breathing heavily , but staring calmly at the onrushing machine . He looked wild and threatening with the bloody bandage angled across his forehead , and his purple , sunken eyes . His bloodstained hands hooked ready at his sides . Christian stood up , but did not go into the center of the track beside Hardenburg . The car raced toward them , its horn blowing loudly , losing itself somehow in the emptiness and sounding like the echo of a warning . lardenburg did n't move . There were five figures in the open car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian was sure the car was going to run the Lieutenant down and he opened his mouth to call , when there was a squeal of brakes and the long , smart-looking machine skidded to a stop an arm 's length in front of Hardenburg . There were two Italian soldiers in front , one driving and the other crouched beside him . In the rear there were three officers . They all stood up and shouted angrily at Hardenburg in Italian . IIardenburg did not move . " I wish to speak to the ranking officer here , " he called coldly in German . There was more Italian . Finally a dark , stout Major said , in bad German . " That is me . If you have anything you wish to say to me , to me over here and say it . " " You will kindly dismount , " Hardenburg said , standing absolutely still , in front of the car . The Italians chattered among themselves . Then the Major opened the rear door and jumped down , fat and wrinkled in what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hardenburg . IIardenburg saluted grandly . The salute looked theatrical coming front this scarecrow in the glaring emptiness of the desert . The Major clicked his heels in the sand and saluted in return . " Lieutenant , " the Major said nervously , looking at Hardenburg 's tabs , " we are in a great hurry . What is it you wish ? " " I am under orders , " Hardenburg said coldly , " to requisition transportationfor General Aigner . " The Major opened his mouth sadly , then clicked it shut . He looked hurriedly about him , as though he expected to see General Aigner tiring suddenly from the blank desert . " Nonsense , " the Major said finally . " There is a New Zealand patrol Inning up this road and we can not delay ... "  | " I am under specific orders , Major , " said Hardenburg in a singsongvoice . " I do not know anything about a New Zealand patrol . " " Where is General Aigner ? " The Major looked around uncertainly again . " Five kilometers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car threw a tread and I am under specific orders . .. " . " I have heard it ! " the Major screamed . " I have already heard about the specific orders . " " If you will be so kind , " Hardenburg said , " you will order the other gentlemen to dismount . The driver may remain . " " Get out of the way , " said the Major . He started back toward the car . " I have heard enough of this nonsense . " " Major , " said Hardenburg coldly and gently . The Major stopped and faced him , sweating . The other Italians stared at him worriedly , but not understanding the German . " It is out of the question , " said the Major , his voice trembling . " Absolutely out of the question . This is an Italian Army vehicle and we are on a mission to . . . " I am very sorry , Sir , " said Hardenburg . " General Aigner outranks you and this is German Army territory . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Major said , but faintly . " At any rate , " Hardenburg said , " there is a road block ahead , and the men there have orders to confiscate all Italian transport . By force if necessary . You will then have to explain what three field grade officers are doing at a moment like this so far from their organizations . You will also have to explain why you took it upon yourself to disregard-a specific order from General Aigner who is in command of all troops in this sector . " He stared coldly at the Major . The Major raised his hand in a strangled gesture . Hardenburg 's expression had not changed at all . It still was weary , disdainful , rather bored . He turned his back on the Major and walked toward the car . Miraculously he even managed for these five steps not to limp . " Furi ! " he said , opening the door to the front of the car . " Out ! The driver will remain , " he said in Italian . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear of the car . They avoided the man 's glance and stared nervously at the Major , who had followed Hardenburg.  |p279Hardenburg  tapped the soldier in the front seat on the arm . " Furi , " he repeated calmly . The soldier wiped his face . Then , looking down at his boots , he got out of the car and stood unhappily next to the Major . They looked amazingly alike , two soft , dark , disturbed Italian faces , handsomeand unmilitary and worried . " Now , " Hardenburg gestured to the other two officers , " you gentlemen . . . " The wave of his arm was unmistakable . The two officers looked at the Major . One of them spoke rapidly in Italian . The Major sighed and answered in three words . The two officers got out of the car and stood beside the Major . " Sergeant , " Hardenburg called without looking over his shoulder . Christian came up and stood at attention . " Clean the back of the car out , Sergeant , " Hardenburg ordered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , per-sonally . " Christian looked into the back of the car . There were water cans , three bottles of Chianti , two boxes of rations . Methodically , one by one , he lifted the rations and the bottles and put them at the Major 's feet on the side of the road . The three officers stared glumly down at their possessions being unloaded onto the desert sand . Christian fingered the water cans thoughtfully . " The water , too , Lieutenant ? " he asked . " The water , too , " Hardenburg said without hesitation . Christian put the water cans beside the ration boxes . Hardenburg went to the rear of the car , where there were rolls of bedding strapped against the metal . He took out his knife . With three swift slashes he cut the leather thongs holding them onto the car . The canvas rolls dropped open into the dust . One of the officers started to speak angrily in Italian , but the Major silenced him with an abrupt wave of his hand . The Major stood very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said in German , " upon a receipt for the chicle . " " Naturally , " Hardenburg said gravely . He took out his map . He tore off a small rectangular corner and wrote slowly on the back of it . " Will this do ? " he asked . He read aloud in a clear , unhurried voice . " Received from Major So and So ... I am leaving the place blank , Major , and you can fill it in at your leisure . . . one Fiat staff car , with driver . Requisitioned by order of General Aigner . Signed , LieutenantSiegfried Hardenburg . " P280The Major snatched the paper and read it over carefully . Ile waved it . " I will present this at the proper place , " he said loudls , " in the proper time . " " Of course , " Hardenburg said . He stepped into the rear of the car . " Sergeant , " he said , sitting down , " sit back here . " Christian got into the car and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewn tan leather and there was A smell of wine and toilet water . Christian stared impassively ahead of him at the burned brown neck of the driver in the front seat . Harden burg leaned across Christian and slammed the door . " Avanti , " Iir said calmly to the driver . The driver 's back tensed for a moment and Christian saw a flush spreading up the bare neck from below the collar . Then the driver delicately put the car in gear . Hardenburg saluted . One by one , the three officers returned the salute . The private who had been sitting beside the driver seemed too stunned to lift his hand . The car moved smoothly ahead , the dust from its spinning wheels tossing lightly over the small group on the side of the road . Christian felt an almost involuntary muscular pull to turn around , but Harden burg 's hand clamped on his arm . " Do n't look ! " Hardenburg snapped . Christian tried to relax into the seat . He waited for the sound of shots , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieutenantwas smiling , a small , frosty smile . He was enjoying it , Christian realized with slow surprise . With all his wounds and with his companylost behind him and God knows what ahead of him , Harden- ' burg was enjoying the moment , savoring it , delighting in it . Christian could n't smile , but he sank back into the soft leather , feeling his racked bones settling luxuriously in his resting flesh . " What would have happened , " he asked after awhile , " if they had decided to hold onto the car ? " Hardenburg smiled , his eyelids half-lowered in sensuous enjoymentas he spoke . " They would have killed me , " he said . " That is all . " Christian nodded gravely . " And the water , " he said . " Why did you let them have the water ? " " Ah , " Hardenburg said , " that would have been just a little toomuch . " He chuckled as he settled back in the rich leather . " What do you think will happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They will surrender and go toP281British prison . Italians love to go to prison . Now , " he said , " keep quiet . I wish to sleep . " A moment later , his breath coming evenly , his bloody , filthy face composed and childlike , he was sleeping . Christian remained awake . Someone , he thought , ought to watch the desert and the driver who sat rigidly before them , holding the speeding , powerful car on the road . Mesa Matruh was like a candy-box in which a death had taken place . They tried to find someone to report to , but the town was a chaos of trucks and staggering men and broken armor among the ruins . While they were there a squadron of planes came over and dropped bombs on them for twenty minutes . There were more ruins and an ambulance train was spilled open , with men shouting like animals from the twisted wreckage , and everybody seemed intent only upon pressing west , so Hardenburg ordered the driver into the long , slowly moving stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the town . There was a control post there , with a gaunt-eyed Captain with a long sheet of paper mounted on a board . The Captain was taking down names and organization designationsfrom the caked and exhausted men streaming past him . He looked like a lunatic accountant trying to balance impossible accountsin a bank that was tottering in an earthquake . He did not know where their Division Headquarters were , or whether they still existed . He kept saying in a loud , dead voice , through the cake of dust around his lips , " Keep moving . Keep moving . Ridiculous . Keep moving . " When he saw the Italian driver he said , " Leave that one here with inc . We can use him to defend the town . I 'll give you a German driver . " Hardenburg spoke gently to the Italian . The Italian began to cry , but he got out of the car , and stood next to the Captain with the long sheet of paper . He took his rifle with him , but held it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It looked harmless and inoffensive in his hands as he stared hopelessly at the guns and the trucks and the tottering soldiers rolling past him . " We will not hold Matruh forever , " Hardenburg said grimly , " with troops like that . " " Of course , " the Captain said crazily . " Naturally not . Ridiculous . " And he peered into the dust and put down the organization numbersP282of two anti-tank guns and an armored car that rumbled past him , smothering him in a fog of dust . But he gave them a tank driver who had lost his tank and a Messerschmitt pilot who had been shot down over the town to ride with them , and told them to get back to Solum as fast as possible , there was a likelihood things were in better shape that far back . The tank driver was a large blond peasant who grasped the wheel solidly as he drove . He reminded Christian of Corporal Kraus , dead outside Paris long ago with cherry stains on his lips . The pilot was young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a bad twitch that pulled his mouth to the right twenty times a minute . " This morning , " he kept saying , " this morning I did not have this . It is getting worse and worse . Does it look very bad ? " " No , " said Christian , " you hardly notice it . " " I was shot down by an American , " the pilot said , wonderingly . " Imagine that . The first American I ever saw . " He shook his head as though this was the final and most devastating point scored against German arms in all the campaigns in Africa . " I did n't even know they were here . Imagine that ! " The blond peasant was a good driver . They darted in and out of the heavier traffic , making good time on the bombed and pitted road alongside the shining blue waters of the Mediterranean , stretching , peaceful and cool , to Greece , to Italy , to Europe .. . It happened the next day . They still had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrecked truck along the road , and they were in a long , slow line that was moving in fits and starts up the winding , ruined road that climbs from the small , wiped-out village of Solum to the Cyrenaican escarpment . Down below , the fragments of walls gleamed white and pretty about the keyhole-shaped harbor , where the water shone bright green and pure blue as it sliced into the burned land . Wrecks of ships rested in the water , looking like the deposit of ancient wars , their lines wavering gently and peacefully in the slight ripples . The pilot was twitching worse than ever now and insisted upon looking at himself in the rearview mirror all the time , in an effort to catch the twitch at the moment of inception and somehow freeze it there to study it . So far he had not been successful , and he had screamed in agony every time he fell off to sleep the night before . Hardenburg was getting very impatient with him . P283But there were signs that order was being restored down below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two battalionsof infantry could be seen digging in on the eastern edge , and a General had been seen striding back and forth near the harbor , waving his arms about and delivering himself of orders . Certain armored elements had been held out of the column that stretched back as far as the eye could reach . They were being assembledin a reserve area behind the infantry and small figures could be seen from the height pouring fuel and handing up ammunition to the men working in the turrets . Hardenburg was standing up in the rear of the car , surveying everythingkeenly . He had even managed to shave in the morning , although he was running a high fever . His lips were cracked and covered with sores , he had a new bandage on his forehead , but he looked once more like a soldier . " This is where we stop them , " he announced . " This is as far as they go . " Then the planes had come in low from the sea , the drumming of their engines drowning out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They came in regular , arrow-like formation , like stunt-fliers at a carnival . They looked slow and vulnerable . But somehow , no one was firing at them . Christian could sec the bombs dropping in twisting , curling arcs . Then the mountainside was exploding . A truck deliberatelytoppled over above them , and went crashing ponderously into the ravine a hundred meters below . One boot flew in a long , tumbling curve out from it , as though it had been thrown out from the truck by a man who was resolved to save the first thing that came to his hand from the wreck . Then the bomb hit close by . Christian felt himself being lifted , and he thought : It is not fair , after having come so far and so hard , it is not at all fair . Then he knew he was hurt , except that there was uo pain , and he knew that he was going to go out , and it was quite peaceful and delicious to relax into the spinning , many-colored , but painless chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes . Something was weighing him down and he pushed against it , but there was no use . There was the yellow smell of cordite and the brassy smell of burned rock and the old smell of dying vehicles , burning rubber and leather and singed paint . Then he saw a uniform and a bandage and he realized that it must be LieutenantHardenburg , and Lieutenant Hardenburg was saying calmly , " Get me to a doctor . " But only the voice and the tabs and theP284bandage was Lieutenant Hardenburg because there was no face there at all . There was just a red and white pulpy mass , with the calm voice coming somehow through the red bubbles and the white strips of whatever it had been that had held the inside of Lieutenant Harden burg 's face together . Dreamily , Christian tried to remember where he had seen something like that before . It was hard to remember because he had a tendency to go out again , but finally it came back to him . It was like a pomegranate , roughly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juice running from the glistening , ripe globules past the knife down onto the shining ivory plate . Then he began to hurt and he did n't think about anything else for a long time . P285THEY ASSURE ME , " the voice behind the bandages was saying , " that in two years they can give me a face . I am not under any illusions . I will not look like a motion-picture actor , but I am confidentit will be a serviceable face . " Christian had seen some of the serviceable faces that the surgeons patched onto the wrecked skulls delivered to their tables , and he was not as confident as Hardenburg , but he merely said , " Of course , Lieu-tenant . " " It is already almost definite , " the voice went on , " that I will see out of my right eye within a month . By itself that is a victory , even t it was as far as they could go . " " Certainly , Lieutenant , " Christian said in the darkened room of Ilic villa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter sunlightof the Bay of Naples . He was sitting between the beds , with his iiht leg , bandaged and stiff in front of him , just touching the marble floor and his crutches leaning against the wall . The case in the other bed was a Burn , an armored-division burn , very bad , and the Burn merely lay still under his ten meters of bandage , filling the high-ceilinged cool room with the usual smell , which was worse than the aroma of the dead , but which Hardenburg could not smell , because he had nothing left to smell with . An economically-mindednurse had realized this fortunate fact and hadP286placed them side by side , since the hospital , once the vacation spot of a prosperous Lyons silk manufacturer , was being crowded more and more every day with the surgically interesting . products of the fighting in Africa . Christian was in a larger hospital down the hill , devoted to the common soldiers , but they had given him his crutches a week ago , and he now felt like a free man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Hardenburg , " to come and visit me . As soon as you get hurt people have a tendency to treat you as though you were eight years old , and your brain goes to rot along with everything else . " " I was very anxious to see you , " Christian said , " and tell you in person how grateful I am for what you did for me . So when I heard you were on the Island , too , I . . . " Nonsense ! " It was amazing how much the same , clipped , precise , snarling , Hardenburg 's voice was , although the whole facade that had shielded the voice was now gone . " Gratitude is out of order . I did not save you out of affection , I assure you . " " Yes , Sir , " said Christian . " There were two places on that motorcycle . Two lives could be saved that might be useful somewhere later on . If there was someone else there who I thought would be more valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , Sir , " said Christian , staring at the smooth , white , unfeatured bandages wrapped so neatly about the head that he had last seen red and dripping on the hill outside Solum , with the noise of the British planes dying away in the distance . The nurse carne in . She was a motherly-looking woman of about forty , with a kindly , fat face . " Enough , " she said . Her voice was not motherly , but bored and business-like . " The visit is over for the day . " She stood at the door , waiting to make sure that Christian left . Christian stood slowly , taking hold of his crutches . They made a sodden , wooden noise on the marble floor . " At least , " said Hardenburg , " I will be able to walk on my owl ' two feet . " " Yes , Sir , " Christian said . " I 'll visit you again , if you are agreeable , Lieutenant . " " If you wish , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sergeant , " said the nurse . Christian tapped his way out clumsily , because he had only recentlyP287learned how to handle the crutches . It was very good to be out in the corridor , where you could not smell the Burn . " She will not be too disturbed , " Hardenburg was saying through the white muffling wall of bandage , " by the change in my appearance . " He was talking about his wife . " I have written her and told her I was hit in the face and she said she was proud of me and that it would alter nothing . " No face , Christian thought , that is quite a change in appearance . But he said nothing . He sat between the two beds , with his leg out , and his crutches in their accustomed place against the wall . Now he came to visit the Lieutenant almost every day . The Lieutenanttalked , hour after hour , through the white darkness of the bandages , and Christian said , " Yes , Sir , " and " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelled just as badly , but after the first few gagging moments each time , Christian found himself able to bear it and even , after awhile , to forget it . Locked in his blindness , Hardenburg talked calmly and reflectively for hours on end , slowly unwinding the tissue of his life for his own and Christian 's benefit , as though now , in this enforced and brutal holiday , he was taking inventory of himself , weighing himself , judging his past triumphs and errors and mapping out the possibilities of his future . It grew more and more fascinating for Christian , and he found himself spending half-days in the evilsmellingroom , following the spiraling , oblique uncovering of a life that he felt to be more and more significantly locked with his own . The sickroom became a combination of lecture room and confessional , a place in which Christian could find his own mistakes clarified , his own vague hopes and aspirations crystallized , understood , categorized . The war was a dream on other continents , an unreal grapplingof shadows , muffled trumpets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two swathed and stinking figures overlooking the sunny , blue harbor , was real , true , important . " Gretchen will be very valuable to me , " Hardenburg was saying , " after the war . Gretchen , that 's the name of my wife . " " Yes , Sir , " said Christian , " I know . " " How do you know ? Oh , yes , I sent you to deliver a package . " " Yes , Sir , " said Christian . " She is quite handsome , Gretchen , is n't she ? " " Yes , Sir . Quite handsome . " " Very important , " said Hardenburg . " You would be amazed at theP288number of careers that have been ruined in the Army by dowdy wives . She is also very capable . She has a knack for handling people .. . " Yes , Sir , " said Christian . " Did you have an opportunity to talk to her ? " " For about ten minutes . She questioned me about you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , Sir . " " I plan to see her in eighteen months . My face will be well enough along by then . I do not wish to shock her unnecessarily . Very valuable . She has a knack of being at home wherever she finds herself , of being at ease , saying the correct thing ... " " Yes , Sir . " " To tell you the truth , I was not in love with her when I married her . I was very much attached to an older woman . Divorced . With two children . Very attached . I nearly married her . It would have ruined me . Her father was a laborer in a metal factory and she herself had a tendency to fat . In ten years she will be monstrous . I had to keep reminding myself that in ten years I expected to have Ministersand Generals as guests in my home and that my wife would have to serve as hostess . She had a vulgar streak , too , and the children were impossible . Still , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , weak sensation . Have you ever been like that about a woman ? " " Yes , Sir , " said Christian . " It would have been ruinous , " said the voice behind the bandages . " A woman is the most common trap . A man must be sensible in that department as in anything else . I despise a man who will sacrifice himself for a woman . It is the most sickly form of self-indulgence . If it were up to me , I would have all the novels burned , too , all of them , along with Das Kapital and the poems of Heine . " And another time , on a wet day , with the Bay outside the window gray and hidden in the sweep of winter rain .. . " After this one is over , we must leap into another war . Against the Japanese . It is alwaysnecessary to subdue your allies . It is something that is left out of Mein Kampf , perhaps out of shrewdness on the author 's part . And after that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to grow strong , so that we can always have an enemy who will be quite difficult to beat . To be great , a nation must always be stretched to the limit1s of its endurance . A great nation is always on the verge ofP289collapse and always eager to attack . When it loses that eagerness , history begins to tap out the name on the tombstone . The Roman Empire stands as a perfect example for any intelligent people forever . The moment a people changes from , ' Whom shall I hit next ? ' to ' Who will be the next to hit me ? ' it is on the road to the dust-heap . Defense is only a coward 's anagram for defeat . There is no successful defense to anything . Our civilization , so called , which is merely a combination of laziness and an unwillingness to die , is the great evil . England is the dessert on the Roman dinner . It is never possible to enjoy the fruits of war in peace . The fruits of war can only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the British gazed around and said , ' Look what we have won . Now let us hold onto it , ' an empire slipped through their fingers . It is always necessary to remain barbarians , because it is the barbarians who always win . " We Germans have the best chance of all . We have an elite of daring and intelligent men , and we have a large , energetic population . It is true that other nations , say the Americans , have as many daring and intelligent men , and a population that is at least as energetic . But we are more fortunate , for one reason , and we shall conquer because of it . We are docile and they are not and probably never will be . We do what we are told and so we become an instrument in the hands of our leaders that can be used for decisive acts . The Americans can be made an instrument for a year , five years , but then they break lip . The Russians are dangerous , merely because of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been , and the energy of the people is canceled out , by ignorance . It is only the size that is danger , and I do not believe it to be crucial . " The voice spun on , like the voice of a thoughtful scholar in a university library , reading from a well-loved book that had almost been memorized by the reader . The rain hit the window in soft , wet Tufts , obscuring the harbor . The Burn in the next bed lay without moving , deep in its frightful smell , deep past hearing or caring or remembering anything . " In several ways , " Hardenburg was saying , " this wound of mine was a fortunate occurrence . " It was another afternoon , still and dreamlike , with the sun late in the sky , and the entire landscape deep blue , water , air and mountains transparent and luminous outside the window . " Somehow , I was not very lucky in the Army  --  and this wound will mean I will not be tied to the Army any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army . As you know , I was only promoted once , while men who had gone to school with me were promoted five times . There is no use complaining . It has nothing to do with favoritism or merit . It is merely a question of where you happen to be at certain moments . At a particular headquarters when the General there is given a lucky command . At a particular place in the line when the enemy attacks . How the despatches are worded on some mornings and who chances to read them that morning and how he is feeling at the moment . . . Well , it was becoming clear I was not lucky in that direction . Now they will not send me back into the Army . It is bad for the morale to have men commanded by an officer with a maimed face . Perfectly sensible . You do not march a company through a military cemetery before an attack if you can help it . Simple discretion . But a wounded face will be of value later , just the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing it later , through the Army , but I will save twenty years this way . Positionsof leadership when the war is over will only be open to men who can prove they have served the Fatherland well on the battlefield . I will not have to wear my medals on my lapel . My face will be my medal . Pity , respect , gratitude , fear  --  my face will produce them all . There will be a world to be governed when this is over , and the Party will find my face as good a symbol as any to represent them in other countries . " The idea of my face does not disturb me . When they take the bandages off I am going to get up and look at it in the mirror . I am quite certain that it is going to be horrible . Horror should not annoy a soldier any more than the sight of a hammer annoys a carpenter . It is sentimental to pretend that horror is not the tool of the soldier , just as the hammer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the threat of death and we must take it calmly and use it well . For the purposes of our country we need an empty Europe . It is a mathematicalproblem and the equalizing sign is slaughter . If we believe in the truth of the answer we must not draw back from the arithmetic which solves the equation . " Wherever we go everyone must realize that we are quick to kill . It is the most satisfactory key to dominion . Eventually I came to enjoykilling ; as a pianist enjoys the Czerny which keeps his fingers limber for the Beethoven . It is the most valuable equipment in any military man , and when an officer loses it he should ask to be cashieredand returned to civilian life to take up bookkeeping .   " I have read some of your letters to your friends back home and I have been revolted by them . You are much older than I am , of course , and have been exposed to a great deal of Europe 's nonsense , and I see your letters are full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the world that will come when the war is over . That is all very well for women and politicians , but a soldier should know better . He should not want peace , because peace is a buyer 's market for a soldier , and he should know that prosperity can only be unilateral . We can be prosperous only if all Europe is a pauper , and a soldier should be delighted with that concept . Do I want the illiteratePole , drunk on potato alcohol in the winter mud of his village , to be prosperous ? Do I want the stinking goatherd in the Dolomites to be rich ? Do I want a fat Greek homosexual to teach Law at Heidelberg ? Why ? I want servants , not competitors . And failing that , I want corpses . It is only because we are still part politicians , we Germans , selling ourselves to the world for an outdated and unnecessary vote of confidence , that we talk like that . In ten years we can display ourselvesas what we are  --  soldiers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense . The soldier 's world is the only real world . Any other world is something off the shelf of a library  --  rhetoric and old bindings . Flabby wishes and banquet speeches at a table at which all the guests have fallen asleep . Ten thousand shelves of books cannotstop one light tank . The Bible has been printed a billion times , perhaps , and a single patrol of five men in an armored car can break the ten commandments fifty times in a half hour in a Ukrainian village and celebrate that night over two cases of captured wine . " War is the most fascinating of all pursuits because it most completelyfits the final nature of man , which is predatory and egotistic . I can say it because I have given my face for it , and no one can accuse nee of loving it safely from a distance and for its rewards alone . " I do not think we are going to lose this war , because we can not afford to . But if we do lose it we will lose it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world that for every day of war , we would kill one hundred thousand Europeans , and kept to our promise , how long do you think the war would last ? And not Jews , because everyone is used to seeing Jews killed and everyone is more or less secretly delighted with us for our efficiency in that field . And the supply of Jews is not inexhaustible , no matter how generously we compute grandmothers . No . Europeans , Frenchmen , Poles , Russians , Dutchmen , English prisoners of war . We should print the lists ofP292names , with photographs , on good paper , and drop them over Londoninstead of bombs . We are suffering because our conduct is not yet as mature as our philosophy . We kill Moses , but pretend to tolerateChrist , and we risk everything for that brainless pretense . " When we overcome remorse we shall be the greatest people in Western history . We may do it without that , but in the meanwhilc we are dragging a hidden anchor . " I tell you these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not . I have had a chance these last months to think all these things out and I can use disciples . After the last war it took a wounded Corporal to save Germany from its defeat . After this war it may take a wounded Lieutenant to save Germany from its victory . You can write me from the front and I can lie back here while my face mends and feel that I have not been useless . I am younger than you , but I am far more mature because I have not done a thing sinec I was fifteen years old without relating it to my purpose . You have drifted and modified and sentimentalized and it has kept you in inconclusiveadolescence . The reasonable modern man is the man who has learned to press things immediately , in a single step of logic , to their reasonable conclusions . I have done that and you have not , and until you learn to do so , you will be a child in a room full of grownups . " Killing is an objective act and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can kill a nineteen-year-old Lieutenant two months out of Oxford and leave three dozen Germans to die on a hill with exactly the same calculation , because I know these things . Each contributes as he can , all thirty-seven of them by dying in a particular way and at a particular time that I find convenient or necessary . I will weep over none of them , unless I am watched by a company who will be encouraged to die the same evening by my tears . " If you think that I admire the German soldier you are wrong . Ile is better than other soldiers because he can be hammered harder without wearing through and because he will permit himself to be trained more thoroughly because he lacks imagination . But his courageis a trick that is played upon him , like any other soldier 's courage , and his victory will mean no more beer for him than before , and no less labor , and he does not know these things . An army finally is no more than the function of its numbers multiplied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for once he was right . The German soldier is not responsible either for the fact that there are ten millionP293more like him , or for the fact that he has the most gifted men in Europe guiding him . The birth rate of Central Europe takes care of the first and accident and the ambition of a thousand men takes care of the second . " The German soldier has the good luck that at this balancing moment in history he is being led by men who are a little mad . Hitler falls into fits before the maps at Berchtesgaden . Goering was dragged from the sanitarium for dope addicts in Sweden . Roehm , Rosenberg , all the rest , would make old Dr. Freud rub his , hands in Vienna if he peeked out and saw them waiting in his anteroom . Only the irrational vision of a madman could understand that an empire could be won in ten years merely by promising to institutionalize the pogrom . After all , Jews have been murdered for twenty centuries without any importantresult . We are being led against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deviate from the rules if they burst a kidney in the effort , and we are being led by men exalted by opium fumes and by gibbering Corporals who picked up their lessons in military affairs from serving tea in a trench to a broken Captain twenty-five years ago at Passchendaele . How can we expect to lose ? " If I had epilepsy or if I had been treated once for amnesia or taranoia I would have higher hopes for my success in Europe in the ext thirty years , and I would serve my country better ... " The doctor was a gray-haired man . He looked seventy years old . He had pouches under his eyes of wrinkled purple skin , like the flesh of swamp flowers , and his hands shook as he poked harshly at Christian'sknee . He was a Colonel and he looked too old even for a Colonel . There was brandy on his breath and the small , watery spurts of his eyes suspiciously searched Christian 's scarred leg and Christian'sface for the malingering and deception the doctor had found so often in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kaiser , the Army of the Social Democrats , and the Army of the Third Reich . Only the doctor 's breath , Christian thought , has remained the same over the thirty years . The Generals have changed , the Sergeants have died , the philosophies have veered from north to south , but the Colonel 's breath bears the same rich freight by a dark bottle out of Bordeaux that it did when Emperor Franz Josef stood beside his brother monarch in Vienna to review the first Saxony Guards on their way into Serbia . " You 'll do , " said the Colonel , and the medical orderly busilyP294marked down two ciphers on Christian 's card . " Excellent . It does n't look so good to the eye , but you can march fifty kilometers a day and never feel it . Eh ? " " I did not say anything , Colonel , " said Christian . " Full field duty , " the Colonel said , peering harshly at Christian , as though Christian had contradicted him . " Eh ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leg impatiently . " Roll down your trousers , Sergeant , " he said . He watched Christian stand up and push his trouser leg down into place . " What was your profession , Sergeant , before the war ? " " I was a skiing instructor , Sir . " " Eh ? " The Colonel glared at Christian as though he had just insultedhim . " What was that ? " " Skiing , Sir . " " Eh , " said the Colonel flatly . " You will not ski with that knee any more . It is for children anyway . " He turned away from Christian and washed his hands , with meticulous thoroughness , as though Christian'sbare pale flesh had been unutterably filthy . " Also , from time to time , you will find yourself limping . Eh , why not ? Why should n't a man limp ? " He laughed , showing yellow false teeth . " Flow will people know you have been in the war otherwise ? " He scrubbed busily at his hands in the large enamel sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the town . " You will kindly get me a bayonet , " Hardenburg said . Christian was sitting at his side , looking at his leg , stretched , still stiff and dubious , out in front of him . In the next bed the Burn lay , lost as always in his silent Antarctic of bandage and his tropical and horrible smell . Christian had just told Hardenburg that he was leaving the next day for the Front . Hardenburg had said nothing , but had merely lain still and rigid , his smooth , swathed head like a frightening and morbid egg on the pillow . Christian had waited for a moment and then had decided that Hardenburg had not heard him . " I said , Lieutenant , " he repeated , " that I was leaving tomorrow . " " I heard you , " Hardenburg said . " You will kindly get me a bayonet . " " What was that , Sir ? " Christian asked thinking : It only sounds like bayonet because of the bandages . " I said I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @   " I am leaving at two o'clock in the afternoon , " Christian said . " Bring it in the morning . " Christian looked at the overlapping , thin lines where the bandage crossed over itself on the round , smooth surface , but there was no expression there , of course , to give him a clue to what Hardenburg was thinking , and as usual , nothing was to be learned from the everlasting , even tone of the hidden voice . " I do n't have a bayonet , Sir , " he said . " Steal one tonight . There is no complication there . You can steal one , ca n't you ? " " Yes , Sir . " " I do n't want the scabbard . Just bring me the knife . " " Lieutenant , " said Christian , " I am very grateful to you and I would like to be of service to you in every way I can , but if you are going to . . . " He hesitated . " If you are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I am not going to kill myself , " the even , muffled voice said . " What a fool you are . You 've listened to me for nearly two months now . Do I sound like a man who is going to kill himself ? " " No , Sir , but . . . " It 's for him , " Hardenburg said . Christian straightened in the small armless wooden chair . " What 's that , Sir ? " " For him , for him , " Hardenburg said impatiently . " The man in the other bed . " Christian turned slowly and looked at the Burn . The Burn lay quiet , motionless , communicating nothing , as he had lain for two months . Christian turned back to the equal clot of bandage behind which lay the Lieutenant . " I do n't understand , Sir , " he said . " He asked me to kill him , " Hardenburg said . " It 's very simple . He has n't any hands left . Or anything left . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks ago and the idiot told him to stop talkinglike that . " " I did n't know he could speak , " Christian said dazedly . He looked at the Burn again , as though this newly discovered accomplishment must now somehow be apparent in the frightful bed . " He can speak , " Hardenburg said . " We have long conversations at bight . He talks at night . " What discussions , Christian thought , must have chilled the Italian night air in this room , between the man who had no hands and noP296anything else left and the man without a face . He shivered . The Burn lay still , the covers shrouded over the frail frame . He hears now , Christian thought , staring at him , he understands every word we are saying . " He was a watchmaker , in Nuremberg , " Hardenburg said . " I lc specialized in sporting watches . I-le has three children and he has decided he wants to die . Will you kindly bring the bayonet ? " " Even if I bring it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bitter complicity of this eyeless , voiceless , fingerless , faceless suicide , " what good will it do ? He could n't use it anyway . " " I will use it , " said Hardenburg . " Is that simple enough for you ? " " How will you use it ? " " I will get out of bed and go over to him and use it . Now will you bring it ? " " I did n't know you could walk . . . " Christian said dazedly . In three months , the nurse had told him , Hardenburg might expect to take his first steps . With a slow , deliberate motion , Hardenburg threw back the covers from his chest . As Christian watched him rigidly , as he might watch a corpse that had just risen in its grave and stepped out , Hardenburg pushed his legs in a wooden , mechanical gesture , over the side of the bed . Then he stood . He was dressed in baggy , stained flannel pajamas . His bare feet were pallid and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Where is the other bed ? " Hardenburg asked . " Show me the other , bed . " Christian took his arm delicately and led him across the narrow space until Hardcnburg 's knees touched the other mattress . " There , " Hardenburg said flatly . " Why ? " Christian asked , feeling as though he were putting questions to ghosts fleeing past a window in a dream . " Why did n't you tell anybody you could walk ? " Standing there , wavering a little in the yellowing flannel , Hardenburgchuckled behind his casque of bandage . " It is always necessary , " he said , " to keep a certain amount of crucial information about yourselffrom the authorities who control you . " He leaned over and felt lightly around on the blanket covering the chest of the Burn . Then his hand stopped . " There , " a voice said from behind the icedrift of bandage above the counterpane . The voice was hoarse and lacking in human timbre . It was as though a dying bird , a panther drowningP297slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp branch in a storm in the jungle , had at last accomplished speech with one final word . " There . " Hardenburg 's hand stopped , pale yellow and bony , like a weathered and ancient x-ray of a hand on the white counterpane . " Where is it ? " he asked harshly . " Where is my hand , Diestl ? " " On his chest , " Christian whispered , staring fixedly at the ivory , spread fingers . " On his heart , " Hardenburg said . " Just above his heart . ' We have practiced this every night for two weeks . " He turned , with blind certainty , and crossed to his bed and climbed into it . He pulled the covers up to where the helmet of bandage , like archaic armor , rose from his shoulders . " Now bring the bayonet . Do n't worry about yourself . I will hide it for two days after you have gone , so that nobodycan accuse you of the killing . And I will do it at night , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he will keep quiet . " Hardenburg chuckled . " The watchmaker is very good at keeping quiet . " " Yes , Sir , " said Christian quietly , getting up to leave , " I will bring the bayonet . " He brought the crude knife the next morning . He stole it at a canteen in the evening while its owner was singing " Lili Marlene " loudly over beer with two soldiers from the Quartermaster Corps . He carried it under his tunic to the marble villa of the silk manufacturer , and slid it under the mattress as Hardenburg directed . He only looked back once from the door , after he had said good-bye to the Lieutenant , looked back once at the two white blind figures lying still in the parallel beds in the tall-ceilinged rather gay room with the Bay shining and sunny outside through the high , elegant windows . As he limped down the corridor , away from the room , his boots making a heavy , plebeian sound on the marble , he felt like a scholar who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has memorized and sucked dry . P298ttention ! " a voice called from the door , dramatic and alarming , and Noah stiffened rigidly in front of his bunk . Captain Colclough came in , followed by the Top Sergeant and Sergeant Rickett , and began his Saturday inspection . He walked slowly down the scrubbed middle aisle of the barracks , between the stiff rows of barbered and laundered soldiers . He peered heavily at their hairlines and the shine on their shoes , with a hostile impersonality , as though these were not men he was inspecting , but enemy positions . The blazing Florida sunshine struck in through the bare windows . The Captain stopped in front of the new man , Whitacre . " Eighth General Order , " Colclough said , staring coldly at Whitacre'snecktie . " To give the alarm , " Whitacre said , " in case of fire or disorder . " " Rip that man 's bed , " Colclough said . Sergeant Rickett stepped between the bunks and tore down Whitacre 's bed . The sheets made a dry , harsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broadway , Whitacre , " Colclough said . " You are not living at the Astor Hotel . The maid does not come in here in the morning . You have to learn to make a satisfactory bed , here . " " Yes , Sir , " Whitacre said . " Keep your goddamn mouth shut ! " Colclough said . " When I wantP299you to talk I will give you a direct question and you will answer , Yessir , or Nosir . " Colclough moved down the aisle , his heels strident on the bare floor . The Sergeants moved softly behind him as though noise , too , was a privilege of rank . Colclough stopped in front of Noah . He stared ponderously at him . Colcough had a very bad breath . It smelled as though something were rotting slowly and continuously in Colclough 's stomach . Colcloughwas a National Guard officer from Missouri who had been an undertaker 's assistant in Joplin before the war . His other customers , Noah thought crazily , probably did not mind the breath . He swallowed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat as the Captain glared at his chin for lurking signs of beard . Colclough looked down at Noah 's footlocker , at the sharply folded socks and the geometrically arranged toilet articles . " Sergeant , " he said , " remove the tray . " Rickett bent over and picked up the tray . Underneath were the rigidly folded towels , the stiffly arranged shirts , the woolen underwear , and under the other things , the books . " How many books have you got there , Soldier ? " Colclough asked . " Three . " " Three , what ? " " Three , Sir . " " Are they government issue ? " Under the woolen underwear there were Ulysses and the Collected Poems of T. S. Eliot and the dramatic opinions of George Bernard Shaw . " No , Sir , " said Noah , " they are not government issue . " " Only items of government issue , Soldier , " said Colclough , his breath charging at Noah 's face , " are to be exposed in footlockers . Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Noah said . Colclough bent down and knocked the woolen underwear roughly to one side . He picked up the worn gray copy of Ulysses . Involuntarily , Noah bent his head to watch the Captain . " Eyes front ! " Colclough shouted . Noah stared at a knothole across the barracks . Colclough opened the book and leafed through some of the pages . " I know this book , " he said . " It is a filthy , dirty book . " He threw it on the floor . " Get rid of it . Get rid of all of them . This is not a library , Soldier . You 're not here to read . " The book lay open , faceP300down , its pages crumpled on the floor , isolated in the middle of the barracks . Colclough brushed past Noah , between the double bunks , over to the window . Noah could sense him moving heavily around behind his back . He had a queer , exposed twitching sensation at the base of his spine . " This window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This goddamn barracks is a goddamn pigpen . " He strode out to the aisle again . Without stopping to inspect the rest of the men waiting silently before their cots , he walked to the end of the barracks , followedlightly by the Sergeants . At the door he turned around . " I 'm going to teach you men to keep a clean house , " he said . " If you have one dirty soldier you 're going to learn it 's up to all of you to teach him to be clean . This barracks is confined to quarters until reveille tomorrow morning . There will be no passes given to anyone for the week-end and there will be an inspection tomorrow morning at nine o'clock . I advise you to make sure the barracks is in proper order by that time . " He turned and went out . " Rest ! " Sergeant Rickett shouted and followed the Top Sergeant and the Captain out of the building . Slowly , conscious of the hundred accusing , deprived eyes upon him , Noah moved out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lying . He bent over and picked it up and absently smoothed the pages . Then he walked over to the window that had been the cause of all the trouble . " Saturday night , " he heard in tones of bitter anguish from the other side of the room . " Confined on Saturday night ! I got a date with a waitress that is on the verge and her husband arrives tomorrow morning ! I feel like killing somebody ! " Noah looked at the window . It sparkled colorlessly , with the flat , dusty , sunbitten land behind it . On the lower pane in the corner a moth had somehow managed to fling itself against the glass and had died there in a small spatter of yellow goo . Reflectively , Noah lifted the moth off . He heard steps behind him above the rising murmur of voices , but he continued standing there , holding the suicidal moth , feeling the dusty , unpleasant texture of the shattered wings , looking out over the glaring dust and the distant , weary green of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @   " All right , Jew-Boy . " It was Rickett 's voice behind him . " You 've finally done it . " Noah still did not turn around . Outside the window he saw a group of three soldiers running , running toward the gate , running with the precious passes in their pockets , running to the waiting buses , the bars in town , the complaisant girls , the thirty-hour relief from the Army until Monday morning . " About face , Soldier , " Rickett said . The other men fell silent , and Noah knew that everyone in the room was looking at him . Slowly Noah turned away from the window and faced Rickett . Rickett was a tall , thickly built man with light-green eyes and a narrow colorless mouth . The teeth in the center of his mouth were missing , evidence of some forgotten brawl long ago , and it gave a severe twist to the Sergeant 's almost lifeless mouth and played a curious , irregular lispingtrick to his flat Texas drawl . " Now , Tholdier , " Rickett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another in a lounging , threatening position , " now Ah 'm gawnta take you unduh mah puhsunal wing . Boyth . " He raised his voice for the benefit of the listening men , although he continued to stare , with a sunken , harsh grin , at Noah . " Boyth , Ah promise you , this ith the last tahm little Ikie heah is goin ' tuh interfeah with this ba'acks ' Saturday nights . That 's a solemn promith , Ah thweah t ' Gand . Thith ith n't a shitty thynagogue on the East Side , Ikie , thith ith a ba'ack in the Ahmy of the United Thtates of Americuh , and it hath t ' be kep ' shahnin ' clean , white-man clean , Ikie , white-man clean . " Noah stared fixedly and incredulously at the tall , almost lipless man , slouching in front of him , between the two bunks . The Sergeant had just been assigned to their company the week before , and had seemed to pay no attention to him until now . And in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never before been mentionedby anyone . Noah looked dazedly at the men about him , but they remained silent , staring at him accusingly . " Lethun one , " Rickett said , in the lisp that at other times you could joke about , " begins raht now , promptly and immediutly . Ikie , get into yo ' fatigues and fetch yo'self a bucket . You are gahnta wash eery window in this gandam ba'ack , and you 're gahnta wash them lihk a white , churchgoin ' Christian , t ' mah thatishfaction . Get into yo ' fatigues promptly and immediutly , Ikie , and start workin ' . And of these here windows ai n't shahnin ' like a whore 's belly on Christ-P302math Eve when Ah come around to inthpect them , bah Gand , Ah promith you you 'll regret it . " Rickett turned languidly and walked slowly out of the barracks . Noah went over to his bunk and started taking off his tie . He had the feeling that every man in the barracks was watching him , harshly and unforgivingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new man , Whitacre , was not watching him , and he was painfully making up his bunk , which Rickett had torn down at the Captain 's orders . Just before dusk , Rickett came around and inspected the windows . " All raht , Ikie , " he said finally . " Ah 'm gahn t ' be lenient with yuh , this one tahm . Ah accept the windows . But , remembuh , Ah got mah eye on yuh . Ah 'll tell yuh , heah an ' now , Ah ai n't got no use for Niggerth , Jewth , Mexicans or Chinamen , an ' from now on you 're goin ' to have a powerful tough row to hoe in this here company . Now get your ass inside and keep it there . An ' while you 're at it , you better burn those bookth , like the Captain sayth . Ah do n't mind tellin ' you at thith moment that you ai n't too terrible popular with the Captain , either , and if he seeth those bookth again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Move , Ikie . Ah 'm tand of lookin ' at your ugly face . " Noah walked slowly up the barracks steps and went through tlu  --  door , leaving the twilight behind him . Inside , men were sleeping , and there was a poker game in progress on two pulled-together footlockersin the center of the room . There was a smell of alcohol near the door , and Riker , the man who slept nearest the door , had a wide , slightly drunken grin on his face . Donnelly , who was lying in his underwear on his bunk , opened one eye . " Ackerman , " he said loudly , " I do n't mind your killing Christ , but I 'll never forgive you for not washing that stinking window . " Then he closed his eye . Noah smiled a little . It 's a joke , he thought , a rough joke , but still a joke . And if they take it as something funny , it wo n't be too bad . But the man in the next bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting up with his head in his hands , said quietly , with an air of being very reasonable , " You people got us into the war . Now why ca n't you behave yourselves like human beings ? " and Noah realized that it was n't a joke at all . He walked deliberately toward his bunk , keeping his eyes down , P303avoiding looking at the other men , but sensing that they were all looking at him . Even the poker players stopped their game when he passed them and sat down on his bunk . Even Whitacre , the new man , who looked like quite a decent fellow , and who had , after all , suffered that day at the hands of Authority , too , sat on his re-made bed and stared with a hint of anger at him . Fantastic , Noah thought . This will pass , this will pass .. He took out the olive-colored cardboard box in which he kept his writing paper . He sat on his bunk and began to write a letter to Hope . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished doing my housework . I have polished nine hundred and sixty windows as lovingly as a jeweler shining a fifty-carat diamond for a bootlegger 's girl . I do n't know how I would measure in a battle against a German infantryman or a Japanese Marine , but I will match my windows against their picked troops any day . . . " It 's not the Jew 's fault , " said a clear voice from the poker game , " they 're just smarter than everyone else . That 's why so few of them are in the Army . And that 's why they 're making all the money . I do n't blame them . If I was that smart I would n't be here neither . I 'd be sitting in a hotel suite in Washington watching the money roll in . " There was silence then , and Noah could tell that all the players were looking at him , but he did not look up from his letter . " We also march , " Noah wrote slowly . ' We march uphill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the night . I think the Army is divided into two parts . The fighting Army and the marchingand window-washing Army , and we happen to be assigned to the second part . I have developed the springiest arches ever to appear in the Ackerman family . " " The Jews have large investments in France and Germany , " another voice said from the poker game . " They run all the banks and whorehouses in Berlin and Paris , and Roosevelt decided we had to go protect their money . So he declared war . " The voice was loud and artificial , and aimed like a weapon at Noah 's head , but he refused to look up . " I read in the papers , " Noah wrote , " that this is a war of machines , but the only machine I have come across so far is a mop-wringer ... " " They have an international committee , " the voice went on . " Itmeets in Poland , in a town called Warsaw , and they send out ordersP304all over the world from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , fight that country . Twenty old rabbis with beards . .. " " Ackerman , " another voice said , " did you hear that ? " Noah finally looked across the bunks at the poker players . They were twisted around , facing him , their faces pulled by grins , their eyes marble-like and derisive . " No , " said Noah , " I did n't hear anything . " " Why do n't you join us ? " Silichner said with elaborate politeness . " It 's a friendly little game and we 're involved in an interesting dis-cussion . " " No , thank you , " Noah said . " I 'm busy . " " What we 'd like to know , " said Silichner , who was from Milwaukeeand had a trace of a German accent in his speech , as though he had spoken it as a child and never fully recovered from it , " is how you happened to be drafted . What happened  --  were n't there any fellow-members of the lodge on the board ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is n't shaking , he thought , looking at it in surprise , it 's as steady as can be . " I actually heard , " another voice said , " of a Jew who volunteered . " " No , " said Silichner , wonderingly . " I swear to God . They stuffed him and put him in the Museum . " The other poker players laughed loudly , in artificial , rehearsed amusement . " I feel sorry for Ackerman , " Silichner said . " I actually do . Think of all the money he could be making selling black-market tires and gasoline if he was n't in the infantry . " " I do n't think , " Noah wrote with a steady hand to his wife far away in the North , " that I have told you about the new Sergeant we got last week . He has no teeth and he lisps and he sounds like a debutante at a Junior League meeting when he . . . " " Ackerman ! " Noah looked up . A Corporal from another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted in the orderly room . Right away . " Very deliberately , Noah put the letter he was writing back in the olive-colored box and tucked the box away in his footlocker . He was conscious of the other men watching him closely , measuring his every move . As he walked past them , keeping himself from hurrying , Silichner said , " They 're going to give him a medal . The Delancey Street Cross . For eating a herring a day for six months . " Again there were the rehearsed , artificial volleys of laughter . P305I will have to try to handle this , Noah thought as he went out the door into the blue twilight that had settled over the camp . Somehow , somehow . . . The air was good after the cramped , heavy smell of the barracks , and the wide , silence of the deserted streets between the low buildings was sweet to the ear after the grating voices inside . Probably , Noah thought , as he walked slowly alongside the buildings , probably they are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But even so he was pleased at the momentary peace and the momentary truce with the Army and the world around him . Then he heard a quick scurry of footsteps from behind a corner of the building he was passing , and before he could turn around , he felt his arms pinned powerfully from behind . " All right , Jew-boy , " whispered a voice he almost recognized , " this is dose number one . " Noah jerked his head to one side and the blow glanced off his ear . But his ear felt numb and he could n't feel the side of his face . They 're using a club , he thought wonderingly as he tried to twist away , why do they have to use a club ? Then there was another blow and he began to fall . When he opened his eyes , it was dark and he was lying on the sandy grass between two barracks . His face was collapsed and wet . It took him five minutes to drag himself over to the wall of the building and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Michael was thinking of beer . He walked deliberately behind Ackerman , in the dusty heat , thinking of beer in glasses , beer in schooners , beer in bottles , kegs , pewter mugs , tin cans , crystal goblets . He thought of ale , porter , stout , then returned to thinking of beer . He thought of the places he had drunk beer in his time . The round bar on Sixth Avenue where the Regular Army Colonels in mufti used to stop off on the way uptown from Governor 's Island , where they served beer in glasses that tapered down to narrow points at the bottom and where the bartender always iced the glass before drawing the foaming stuff out of the polished spigots . The fancy restaurant in Hollywood with prints of the French Impressionists behind the bar , where they served it in frosted mugs and charged seventy-five cents a bottle . His own living room , late at night , reading the next morning 's paper in the quiet pool of light from the lamp , as he stretched , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At baseball games at the Polo Grounds in the warm , hazy summer afternoons , where they poured the beer into paper cups so that you could n't throw the bottles at the umpires . Michael marched steadily . He was tired and ferociously thirsty . His hands were numb and swollen , as they always were by the fifth mile of any hike , but he did not feel too bad . He heard Ackerman 's harsh , grunting breath , and saw the way the boy rolled brokenly from side to side as he climbed the gentle slope of the road . He felt sorry for Ackerman . Ackerman had obviously always been a frail boy , and the marches and problems and fatigues had worn the flesh off his bones , so that he now looked like a stripped-down version of a soldier , reedy and breakable . Michael felt a little guilty as he stared fixedly at the heaving , bent back . The long months of training had thinned Michael down , too , but with an athlete 's leanness , leaving his legs steel-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed unjust that in the same column , just in front of him , there was a man whose every step was suffering , while he felt so comparatively fit . Also , there had been the sickening hazing that Ackerman had been submitted to in the last two weeks . The constant ill-tempered jokes , the mock political discussions within Ackerman 's hearing , in which men had said loudly , " Hitler is probably wrong most of the time ; but you 've got to hand it to him , he knows what to do about the Jews . . . Michael had tried once or twice to interrupt with a word of defense , but because he was new in the company , and came from New York and most of the men were Southerners , they ignored him and continued with their cruel game . There was another Jew in the company , a huge man by the name of Fein , who was n't bothered at all . He was n't popular , but he was n't annoyed . Perhaps his size had something to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had large , knotty hands and seemed to take everything easily and without thought . It would be hard to get Fein to take offense at anything , or even realize that he was being offended , so there would be little pleasure in baiting him . And if he did take offense he probably would do a tremendous amount of damage . So he was quietly left in peace by the men who bedeviled Ackerman . The Army , Michael thought . Perhaps he 'd been wrong to tell the man who had interviewed him at Fort Dix that he wanted to go into the infantry . Romantic . Thcrc was nothing romantic about it once you got into it . Sore feet , ig-P307norant men , drunkenness , " Ah 'm goin ' to teach you how to pick up yo ' rahfle and faght fo ' yo ' lahf . . . " I think I can put you into Special Service , " the interviewer had said , " with your qualifications ... " That would probably have meant a- job in New York in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble reply . " Not for me . I 'm not in this Army to sit at a desk . " What was he in the Army for ? To cross the state of Florida on foot ? To re-make beds that an ex-undertaker 's assistant found not made to his liking ? To listen to a Jew being tortured ? He probably would have been much more useful hiring chorus girls for the USO , would have served his country better in Shubert Alley than here on this hot , senseless road . But he had to make the gesture . A gesture wore out so quickly in an army . The Army . If you had to put what you thought of it in a phrase , a sentence , a paragraph . . . what would you say ? It would be impossible . The Army was composed of ten million splinters . Splinters in motion , splinters that never coalesced , that never went in the same direction . The Army was the Chaplain who gave you the talk after they showed you the sex hygiene picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the man of God in his Captain 's uniform , in front of the blank screen where late the shabby whores and the vile flesh had been shown . " Men , the Army has to be practical . . . " The chanting Baptist voice , in the sweltering plank auditorium . " The Army says , Men will expose themselves . Therefore we show you this picture and show you how a prophylaxis station works . ' But I am here to say that God is better than a prophylaxis , religion is healthier than lust ... " One splinter . Another splinter . The ex-high-school teacher from Hartford with the sallow face and the wild eyes , as though he feared assassination each night . He had whispered to Michael , " I 'm going to tell you the truth about myself . I 'm a Conscientious Objector . I do n't believe in war . I refuse to kill my fellowman . So they put me on KP . I 've been on KP for thirty-six days in a row . I 've lost twentyeightpounds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to force me to kill my fellowman . " The Army . The Regular at Fort Dix who had been in the Army thirteen years , playing on Army baseball and football teams in time of peace . Jock-strap soldiers , they called them . A big , tough-looking man with a round belly from beer drunk at Cavite and Panama City and Fort Riley , Kansas . Suddenly , he had fallen into disfavor in theP308orderly room and had been transferred out of the Permanent Party and had been put on orders to a regiment . The truck had driven up and he had put his two barracks bags on it , and then he had started to scream . He had fallen to the ground and wept and screamed and frothed at the mouth , because it was not a football game he was going to today , but a war . The Top Sergeant , a **34;2252;TOOLONG who had been in the Army since the last war , had come out of the orderlyproom and looked at him with shame and disgust . He kicked him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and throw him , still twitching and weeping , into the back of the truck . The Sergeant then turned to the recruits who were silently watching and had said , " That man is a disgrace to the Regular Army . He is not typical . Not at A typical . Apologize for him . Get the hell out of here ! " The orientation lectures . Military courtesy . The causes of the war which You Are Fighting . The expert on the Japanese question , a narrow , gray-faced professor from Lehigh , who had told them that it was all a question of economics . Japan needed to expand and take over the Asian and Pacific markets and we had to stop her and hold onto them ourselves . It was all according to the beliefs that Michael had had about the causes of war for the last fifteen years . And yet , listening to the dry , professorial voice , looking at the large map with spheres of influence and oil deposits and rubber plantations clearly marked out , he hated the professor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was fighting for liberty or morality or the freedom of subject peoples , and he wanted to be told in such ringing and violent terms that he could go back to his barracks , go to the rifle range in the morning believing it . Michael looked at the men sitting wearily beside him at the lecture . There was no sign on those bored , fatigue-doped faces that they cared one way or another , that they understood , that they felt they needed the oil or the markets . There was no sign that they wanted anything but to be permitted to go back to their bunks and go to sleep .. . In the middle of the speech Michael had resolved to get up and speak in the question period scheduled after the speaker had finished . But by the time the professor had said , " In conclusion , we are in a period of centralization of resources , in which . . . uh ... large groups of capital and national interests in one part of the globe are . . . uh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other parts of the globe , and in defense of the American standard ofp309living , it is absolutely imperative that we have ... uh ... free and unhampered access to the wealth and buying power of China and Indonesia . . . " Michael had changed his mind . He had wanted to say , as he thought , " This is horrible . This is no faith to die by , " but he was tired , and like all the other men around him , he wanted to go back to his barracks and go to sleep . The Army was several beautiful things too . The Flag dipping at Retreat , with the anthem over the publicaddresssystem making you dimly think of other bugles that other Americans had listened to for a hundred years at equal moments . The soft Southern voices on the barracks stoop , after Taps , the ends of the cigarettes glowing in the dark , the voices counting over the treasures of former lives , the names of children , the color of a wife 's hair , the shape of a home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer separate or apart , no longer judge or critic , no longer weighing words and motives , but blindly and faithfullyliving , weary and at peace in the heart of a troubled time . . . In front of Michael , as he marched , Ackerman stumbled . Michael quickened his pace and held Ackerman by the arm . Ackerman looked at him coldly . " Let go , " he said , " I do n't need any help from any-body . " Michael took his hand away and dropped back . One of those Jews , he thought angrily , one of the proud ones . He watched Ackerman 's rolling , staggering walk without sympathy as they crossed the brow of the hill . " Sergeant , " Noah said , standing before the desk in the orderly room behind which the First Sergeant was reading Superman , " I would like permission to speak to the Company Commander . " The First Sergeant did not look up . Noah stood stiff in his fatigues , grimy and damp with sweat after the day 's march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three feet away , reading the sports page of a Jacksonville newspaper . The Company Commander did n't look up . Finally the First Sergeant glanced at Noah . " What do you want , Soldier ? " he asked . " I would like permission , " Noah said , trying to speak clearly through the downpulling weariness of the day 's march , " to speak to the Company Commander . " P310The First Sergeant looked blankly at him . " Get out of here , " he said . Noah swallowed dryly . " I would like permission , " he began stubbornly , " to speak to ... " Get out of here , " the Sergeant said evenly , " and when you conic back , remember to wear your class A uniform . Now get out . " " Yes , Sergeant , " Noah said . The Company Commander did not raise his eyes from the sports page . Noah went out of the small , hot room into the growing twilight . It was hard to know about the uniform . Sometimes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rule seemed to change every half hour . He walked slowly back to his barracks past the lounging men and the loud sound of many small radios blaring tinnily forth with jazzmusic and detective serials . When he got back to the orderly room , in his class A uniform , the Captain was n't there . So Noah sat on the grass across the street from the orderly-room entrance and waited . In the barracks behind him a man was singing , softly , " I did n't raise my boy to be a soldier , the dying mother said . . . " and two other men were having a loud argument about when the war would end. " 1950 , " one of the men kept saying . " The fall of 1950- Wars always end right as winter sets in . " And the other man was saying , " Maybe the German war , but after that the Japs . We 'll have to make a deal with the Japs . " " I 'll make a deal with anyone , " a third voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bulgarians or the Egyptians or the Mexicans or anybody . " " 1950 , " the first man said loudly . " Take my word for it . And we 'll all get a bullet up our ass first . " Noah stopped listening to them . He sat on the scrub grass in the darkness , with his back against the wooden steps , half asleep , waiting for the Captain to return , thinking about Hope . Her birthday was next week , Tuesday , and he had ten dollars saved up and hidden away at the-bottom of his barracks bag , for a gift . What could you get for ten dollars in town that you would n't be ashamed to give your wife ? A scarf , a blouse ... He thought of how she would look in a scarf . Then he thought of how she would look in a blouse , preferablya white one , with her slender throat rising from the white stuff and the dark hair capping her head . Maybe that would be it . Yon ought to be able to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars . P311Colclough came back . He moved heavily up the orderly-room steps . You could tell he was an officer at a distance of fifty yards , just by the way he moved his behind . Noah stood up and followed Colclough into the orderly room . The Captain was sitting at his desk with his cap on , frowning impressivelyat some papers in his hand . " Sergeant , " Noah said quietly . " I would like permission to speak to the Captain . " The Sergeant looked bleakly at Noah . Then he stood up and went the three steps over to the Captain 's desk . " Sir , " he said , " Private Ackerman wants to talk to you . " Colclough did n't look up . " Tell him to wait , " he said . The Sergeant turned to Noah . " The Captain says for you to wait . " Noah sat down and watched the Captain . After a half hour , the Captain nodded to the Sergeant . " All right , " the Sergeant said . " Make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain . " Private Ackerman , " he said , " has permission from the First Sergeant to speak to the Captain . " " Yes ? " Colclough did not look up . " Sir , " said Noah , nervously , " my wife is arriving in town Friday night , and she has asked me to meet her in the lobby of the hotel , and I would like to have permission to leave camp on Friday night . " Colclough did n't say anything for a long time . " Private Ackerman , " he said finally , " you are aware of the Company rule . The entire Company is restricted on Friday nights to prepare for inspection ... " " I know , Sir , " said Noah , " but this was the only train she could get reservations on , and she expects me to meet her , and I thought , just this once . . . " Ackerman , " Colclough finally looked at him , the pale spot on the end of his nose white and twitching , " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know whether I can ever teach that to one of you people , but I 'm goddamn going to try . The Army do n't care whether you ever see your wife or not . When you 're not on duty you can do whatever you please . When you are on duty , that 's all there is to that . Now get out of here . " " Yes , Sir , " said Noah . " Yes , Sir , what ? " Colclough asked . " Yes , Sir . Thank you , Sir , " Noah said , remembering the lecture military courtesy . He saluted and went out . He sent a telegram , although it cost eighty-five cents . But thereP312was no answer in the next two days from Hope , and there was nn way of knowing whether she had received it or not . He could n't sleep all Friday night , in the scrubbed barracks , lying there knowing that Hope was only ten miles from him after all these month , , waiting for him in the hotel , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not knowing about people like Colclough or the blind authority and indifference of the Army , on which love had no claim , , tenderness made no impression . Anyway , he thought dreamily , as lie finally dozed off right before reveille , I 'll see her this afternoon . And maybe it was all for the best . The last traces of my black eye nray disappear by then , and I wo n't have to explain to her about how I got it .. . The Captain was due in five minutes . Nervously , Noah checked the corners of his bunk , the arrangement of the towels in his footlocker , the shine on the windows behind the bunk . He saw the man next to him , Silichner , buttoning the top button of the raincoat which hung in its ordered line among his clothes . Noah had made certain before breakfast that all his clothes were buttoned correctly for the inspection , but he looked once more at his own clothes . I lc swung his overcoat back and then blinked . His blouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was open from the top button down . Frantically , he worked on the buttons . If Colclough had seen the blouse open he would have been certain to restrict Noah for the week-end . He had done worse to others for less , and he had made very clear the fact that he was not fond of Noah . The raincoat , too , had two buttons undone . Oh , God , Noah thought , do n't let hint come in yet , not yet , not until I 'm finished . Suddenly Noah wheeled around . Riker and Donnelly were watch  --  ing him , grinning a little . They ducked their heads and flicked at spots of dust on their shoes . That 's it , thought Noah bitterly , they did it to me . With everyone in the barracks in on it , probably . Know ing what Colclough would do to me when he found it .. . Probahl , they slipped back early after breakfast and slipped the buttons out of their holes . He checked each bit of clothing carefully , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sergeant shouted " Attention ! " from the door . Colclough looked him over coldly and carefully and stared for a long time at the rigid perfection of his footlocker . He went over behind him and fingered every piece of the clothing hanging fromP313the rack . Noah heard the cloth swishing as Colclough let the coats fall back into place . Then Colclough stamped past him , and Noah knew it was going to be all right . Five minutes later the inspection was over and the men started to pour out of the barracks toward the bus station . Noah took down his barracks bag and reached in to the small oilskin sack at the bottom in which he saved his money . He drew the sack out and opened it . There was no money in it . The ten-dollar bill was gone . In its place there was a single piece of torn paper . On it there was one word , printed in oily pencil . " Tough . " Noah stuffed the paper into his pocket . Methodically he hung the barracks bag up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill the man who did that . No scarf , no blouse , no anything . I 'll kill him . Dazedly he walked toward the bus station . He wanted to let the men from his barracks leave on another bus . He did not want to see them this morning . He knew he would get into trouble if he stood beside Donnelly or Silichner or Rickett or any of the others , and this morning was no time for trouble . He waited for twenty minutes on the long line of impatient soldiers and got into the gasoline-smelling bus . There was no one from his company there , and suddenly the faces , shaved and scrubbed and happy with release , seemed like the faces of friends . The man standingnext to him , a huge soldier with a broad , smiling face , even offered him a drink out of a pint bottle of rye he carried in his pocket . Noah smiled at him . " No , thank you , " he said . " My wife just arrived in town and I 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to meet her with alcohol on my breath . " The man grinned broadly , as though Noah had just said something most flattering and agreeable . " Your wife , " he said . " How do you like that ? When was the last time you saw her ? " " Seven months ago , " Noah said . " Seven months ago ! " The man 's face grew sober . He was very young and his skin was fair , like a girl 's , on his tough , agreeable face . " Seven months and this is the first time . " He bent over to the man who was sitting in the seat against which Noah was standing . " Soldier , " he said , " get up and let this married man sit down . He has n't seen his wife for seven months and she 's waiting for him now and he needs all his strength . " The other man grinned and stood up . " You should have told me in the beginning , " he said .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'll do all right . I do n't have to sit down . . . The man with the bottle pushed him down with an imperious , gentle hand . " Soldier , " he said solemnly , " this is a direct order . Sit down and preserve yourself . " Noah sat down and all the men around him grinned at him . " You would n't happen to have a photograph of the lady ? " the big man said . " Well , " said Noah , " the fact is . .. " He got out his wallet and showed the big man the photograph of Hope . The soldier looked at it soberly . " A garden on a morning in May , " he pronounced . By God , I 'm going to get me married , myself , before I let them shoot me . ' . ' Noah put the wallet back , smiling at him , feeling , somehow , that this was an omen , that from now on things would be different , that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side . When the bus stopped in town in front of the post office , the large man , with elaborate care , helped him clown the bus steps to the shabby street , and patted him gently and encouragingly on the shoulder . " Go along , now , Sonny , " the man said , " and have a very nice week-end . And you forget that there is such a thing as the United States Army until reveille Monday morning . " Smiling , Noah waved at him , and hurried toward the hotel where Hope was waiting for him . She was in the crowded lobby , among the surging khaki and the other wives . Noah saw her before she saw him . She was peering , a little shortsightedly , through the milling soldiers and women and dusty potted palms . She looked pale and anxious . The smile that broke over her face when he came up behind her and lightly touched her elbow and said , " Mrs. Ackerman , I presume , " was on the brink of tears . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Noah said softly , " now , now .. . " Do n't worry , " she said , " I 'm not going to cry . " She stood back , holding him at arm 's length , and peered at him . " It 's the first time , " she said , " the first time I 've seen you in uniform . " " How do I look ? " Her mouth trembled a little . " Horrible , " she said . P315Then they both laughed . " Let 's go upstairs , " he said . " We ca n't . " " Why not ? " Noah asked , feeling a clutching sense of disaster . " I could n't get a room here . Full up . That 's all right . " She touched his face and chuckled at the despair she saw there . " We have a place . A rooming house down the street . Do n't look like that . " They joined hands and went out of the hotel . They walked down the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Noah was conscious of the polite , approving stares of the soldiers they passed who had no wives , no girls , and were only going to get drunk that afternoon . The rooming house needed painting . The porch was overgrown with grape vines and the bottom step was broken . " Be careful , " Hope said . " Do n't fall through . This would be an awful time to break your leg . " The door was opened for them by the landlady . She was a thin old woman in a dirty gray apron . She stared coldly at Noah , exuding a smell of sweat , age and dishwater . " This your husband ? " she asked , her bony hand on the doorknob . " Yes , " said Hope . " This is my husband . " " Ummm , " said the landlady , and did not smile when Noah grinned politely at her . The landlady watched them as they mounted the stairs . " This is worse than inspection , " Noah whispered as he followed Hope toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Hope asked . " I 'll tell you , " Noah said , " some other time . " Then the door closed behind them . The room was small , with one window with a cracked pane . The wallpaper was so old and faded that the pattern looked as though it somehow was growing out of the wall . The bed was chipped white iron and there were obvious lumps under the grayish spread . But Hope had put a small bunch of jonquils in a glass on the dresser and her hairbrush was there , sign of marriage and civilization , and she had put a small photograph of Noah , laughing , in a sweater , taken on a summer holiday , under the flowers . They avoided looking at each other , embarrassed . " I had to show her our marriage license , " Hope said . " The land-lady "   " What ? " Noah asked . " Our marriage license . She said you had to fight tooth and nail to maintain a respectable establishment with a hundred thousand drunken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head wonderingly . " Who told you to bring the license down ? " Hope touched the flowers . " I carry it around with me , " she said , " all the time , these days . In my handbag . To remind me .. . Noah walked slowly over to the door . There was an iron key in the lock . He turned it . The clumsy noise of the primitive tumblers screeched through the room . " There , " he said , " I 've been thinking about doing this for seven months . Locking a door . " Suddenly Hope ducked her head . But she brought it up again quickly , and Noah saw she was holding a small box in her hands . " Here , " she said , " I brought you something . " Noah took the box in his hands . He thought of the ten dollars for the gift , and the note at the bottom of his barracks bag , the ragged slip of paper with the sardonic " Tough " on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ten dollars . That could wait until Monday . There were chocolate cookies in the box . " Taste them , " Hope said . " I 'm happy to say I did n't make them myself . I got my mother to bake them and send them on to me . " Noah bit into one of the cookies and they tasted like home . He ate another one . " It was a wonderful idea , " he said . " Take them off , " Hope said fiercely . " Take off those damned clothes . " The next morning they went out for breakfast late . After breakfastthey strolled through the few streets of the small town . People were coming home from church and children in their best clothes were walking in restless , bored dignity among the faded lawns . You never saw children in camp , and it gave a homely and pleasant air to the morning . A drunken soldier walked with severe attention to his feet , along the sidewalk , glowering at the churchgoers fiercely , as though daring them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before noon on a Sunday morning . When he reached Hope and Noah , lie saluted grandly , and said , " Sssh . Do n't tell the MP 's , " and marched sternly ahead .   " Man yesterday , " Noah said , " on the bus , saw your picture . " " What was the report ? " Hope picked softly at his arm with her fingertips . " Negative or positive ? " " A garden , ' he said , a garden on a morning in May . ' " Hope chuckled . " This Army , " she said , " will never win the war with men like that . " " He also said , By God , I 'm going to get married myself , before they shoot me . " ' Hope chuckled again and then grew sober thinking about the last two words . But she did n't say anything . She could only stay one week and there was not time to be wasted talking about matters like that . " Will you be able to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If I have to bribe every MP in the area , " he said . " Friday night I may not be able to manage it , but every other night ... " He looked around regretfully at the shabby , mean town , dusty in the sun , with the ten saloons lining the streets in neon gaudiness . " It 's too bad you do n't have a better place to spend the week ... . " Nonsense , " Hope said . " I 'm crazy about this town . It reminds me of the Riviera . " " You ever been on the Riviera ? " " No . " Noah squinted across the railroad tracks where the Negro section sweltered , privies and unpainted board among the rutted roads . " You 're right , " he said . " It reminds me of the Riviera , too . " " You ever been to the Riviera ? " " No . " They grinned . Then they walked in silence . For a moment Hope leaned her head on his shoulder . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think ? " He knew what she was talking about , but he asked , " How long what ? " " How long is it going to last ? The war ... " A small Negro child was sitting in the dust , gravely caressing a rooster . Noah squinted at him . The rooster seemed to doze , half hypnotized by the movement of the gentle black hands . " Not long , " Noah said . " Not long at all . That 's what everybody says . " " You would n't lie to your wife , would you ? " " Not a chance , " Noah said . " I know a Sergeant at **26;2288;TOOLONG and he says they do n't think we 'll ever get a chance to fight at all , our division . He says the Colonel 's sore as can be , because the Colonel is bucking for BG . " " What 's BG ? " " Brigadier General . " " Am I very stupid , not knowing ? " Noah chuckled . " Yop , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'm so glad , " Hope said . " I 'm delighted . " They turned around without signaling each other , as though they had simultaneous lines to the same reservoir of impulses , and started walking back toward the rooming house . " I hope the son of a bitch never makes it , " IIope said dreamily , after awhile . " Makes what ? " Noah asked , puzzled . " BG . " They walked in silence for a minute . " I have a great idea , " Hope said . " What ? " " Let 's go , back to our room and lock the door . " She grinned at him and they walked a little faster toward their rooming house . There was a knock on the door and the landlady 's voice clanged through the peeling wood . " Mrs. Ackerman . Mrs. Ackerman , I would like to see you for a moment , please . " Hope frowned at the door , then shrugged her shoulders . " I 'll be right down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You stay right where you are , " she said . " I 'll be back in a minute . " She kissed his ear , then unlocked the door and went out . Noah lay back on the bed , staring through mild , half-closed eyes up at the stained ceiling . He dozed , with the Sunday afternoon coming to a warm , drowsy close outside the window , with a locomotive whistle sounding somewhere far off and lonely soldiers ' voices singing , " You make time and you make love dandy , You make swell molasses candv , But , honey , are you makin ' any money , That 's all I want to know , " on the street below . Drowsily , he knew he 'd heard that song before . Then he remembered Roger and that Roger was dead . But before he could think much about it , he fell asleep . He was wakened by the slow closing of the door . He opened his eyes a slit , smiling gently as he saw Hope standing above him.  | " Noah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up . " " Later , " he said . " Much later . Come on down here . " " No , " she said , and her voice was flat . " You 've got to get up now . " He sat up . " What 's the matter ? " " The landlady , " Hope said . " The landlady says we have to get out right away . " Noah shook his head to clear it because he knew he was not getting this straight . " Now , " he said , " let 's hear it again . " " The landlady says we have to get out . " " Darling , " Noah said patiently , " you must have gotten it a little mixed up . " " It 's not mixed up . " Hope 's face was strained and tense . " It 's absolutelystraight . We have to get out . " " Why ? Did n't you take this room for the week ? " " Yes , " said Hope , " I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got it under false pretenses . She said she did n't realize we were Jews . " Noah stood up and slowly went over to the bureau . Ile looked at his smiling picture under the jonquils . The jonquils were getting dry and crackly around the edges . " She said , " Hope went on , " that she suspected from the name , but that I did n't look Jewish . Then when she saw you she began towonder . Then she asked me and I said , of course we were Jewish . " " Poor Hope , " Noah said softly . " I apologize . " " None of that , " Hope said . " I never want to hear anything like that from you again . Do n't you ever apologize to me for anything . " " All right , " Noah said . He touched the flowers vaguely , with a drifting small movement of his fingers . The jonquils felt tender and dead . " I suppose we ought to pack , " he said . " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on the bed and opened it . " It 's nothing personal , " Hope said . " It 's a rule of the house , the landlady said . " " I 'm glad to know it 's nothing personal , " Noah said . " It 's not so bad . " Hope began to put the pink soft clothes into her bag , in the crisp folded way she had of packing anything . " We 'll just go down the street and find another place . " Noah touched the hairbrush on the dresser . It had a worn silver back , with a heavy old-fashioned design of Victorian leaves on it . It shone dully in the dusty , shaded light of the room . " No , " he said , we wo n't find another place . " " But we ca n't stay here ... "  | " We wo n't stay here and we wo n't find another , place , " Noah said , keeping his voice even and emotionless . " I do n't know what you mean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I mean that we 'll walk down to the terminal and we 'll find out when a bus is leaving for New York and you 'll get on it . " There was silence in the room . Hope just stood there , looking solemn and reflective , staring at the rosy underclothes tucked away in the bag on the bed . " You know , " she whispered , " this is the only week I can get in God knows how long . And we do n't know what will happen to you . You may be shipped to Africa , to Guadalcanal , any place , next week , and .. . " I think there 's a bus leaving at five o'clock , " Noah said . " Darling . " Hope did not move from her sober , thoughtful position in front of the bed . " I 'm sure we could find another place in this town .. . " I 'm sure we could , " Noah said . " But we 're not going to . I do n't want you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's all . I ca n't love you in this town . I want you to get out of it and stay out of it ! The sooner the better ! I could burn this town or drop bombs on it , but I refuse to love you in it ! " Hope came over to him swiftly and held him . " Dearest , " she shook him fiercely , " what 's happened to you ? What have they been doing to you ? " " Nothing , " Noah shouted . " Nothing ! I 'll tell you after the war ! Now pack your things and let 's get , out of here ! " Hope dropped her hands . " Of course , " she said , in a low voice . She went back to folding her clothes and placing them precisely in her bag . Ten minutes later they were ready . Noah went out carrying her valise and the small canvas bag in which he kept his extra shirt and shaving kit . He did n't look back as he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . The lowering sun was slanting through the breaks in the unhinged shutter in thin , dusty gold . The jonquils remained in their glass on the dresser , bending over a little now , as though the weight of approaching death had made their blossoms heavy . But otherwise the room was as it had been when first she entered it . She closed the door softly and followed Noah down the stairs . The landlady was on the porch , still in the gray apron . She saidP321nothing when Noah paid her , merely standing there in her smell of sweat , age and dishwater , looking with silent , harsh righteousness at the soldier and the young girl who walked slowly up the quiet street toward the bus station . There were some men sleeping in the barracks when Noah got there . Donnelly was snoring drunkenly near the door , but no one paid any attention to him . Noah took down his barracks bag and with maniacal care he went through every article there , the extra shoes , the wool shirts , the clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoe-dubbing . But the money was n't there . Then he got down the other barracks bag , and went through that . The money was n't there . From time to time he glanced up sharply , to see if any of the men were watching him . But they slept , in the snoring , hateful , unprivate , everlasting way . Good , he thought , if I caught any of them looking at me , I would kill them . He put the scattered things back into the bags , then took out his box of stationery and wrote a short note . He put the box on his bunk and strode down to the orderly room . On the bulletin board outside the orderly room , along with the notices about brothels in town that were out of bounds and regulations for wearing the proper uniforms at the proper times , and the list of promotions that had come through that week , there was a space reserved for lost-andfoundnotices . Noah tacked his sheet of paper up on top of a plea by PFC O'Reilly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken from his footlocker . There was a light hanging outside the orderly room , and in its frail glare , Noah re-read what he had written . To the Personnel of Company C ... Ten dollars has been stolen from the barracks bag of Private Noah Ackerman , 2nd Platoon . I am not interested in the return of the money and will press no charges . I wish to take my satisfaction , in person , with my own hands . Will the soldier or soldiers involved please communicate with me immediately . Signed , Private Noah AckermanNoah read what he had written with pleasure . He had a feeling , he turned away , that he had taken the one step that would keep bim from going mad . P322The next evening , as he was going to the mess hall for supper , Noah stopped at the bulletin board . His notice was still there . And under it neatly typed , was a small sheet of paper . On the sheet of paper , there were two short sentences . We took it , Jew-Boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. CowleyJ . Wright W. DemuthL . Jackson E. RikerM . Silichner R. IIenkelP . Sanders T. BrailsfordMichael was cleaning his rifle when Noah came up to him . " May I talk to you for a moment ? " Noah said . Michael looked up at him with annoyance . He was tired and , as usual , he felt incompetent and uncertain with the intricate clever mechanism of the old Springfield . " What do you want ? " ) Michael asked . Ackerman had n't said a word to him since the moment on the hike . " I ca n't talk in here , " Noah said , glancing around him . It was after supper , and there were thirty or forty men in the barracks , reading , writing letters , fiddling with their equipment , listening to the radio . " Ca n't it wait ? " Michael asked coldly . " I 'm pretty busy just now . . . " " Please , " Noah said . Michael glanced up at him . Ackerman 's face was set in withered , trembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darker than usual . " Please ... " he repeated . " I 've got to talk to you . I 'll wait for you outside . " Michael sighed . " O.K. , " he said . He put the rifle together , wrestling with the bolt , ashamed of himself , as always , because it was so difficult for him . God , he thought , feeling his greasy hands slip along the oily stubborn surfaces , I can put on a play , discuss the significance of Thomas Mann , and any farm boy can do this with his eyes closed better than I can . . . He hung the rifle up and went outside , wiping the oil off his hand% . Ackerman was standing across the Company street in the darkness , a small , slender form outlined by a distant light . Ackerman waved to him in a conspiratorial gesture , and Michael slowly approached lino , thinking , I get all the nuts .. .  | " Read this , " Noah said as soon as Michael got close to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Michael turned so he could get some light on the papers . He squinted and read first the notice that Noah had put up on the bulletin board , which he had not read before , and the answer , signed by the ten names . Michael shook his head and read both notes over carefully . " What the hell is this ? " he asked irritably . " I want you to act as my second , " Noah said . His voice was dull and heavy , and even so , Michael had to hold himself back from laughing at the melodramatic request . " Second ? " he asked incredulously . " Yes , " said Noah . " I 'm going to fight those men . And I do n't trust myself to arrange it myself . I 'll lose my temper and get into trouble , I want it to be absolutely correct . " Michael blinked . Of all the things you thought might happen to you before you went into the Army , you never imagined anything like this . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a joke . " " Maybe , " said Noah flatly . " Maybe I 'm getting tired of jokes . " " What made you pick on me ? " Michael asked . Noah took a deep breath and Michael could hear the air whistling into the boy 's nostrils . fie looked taut and very handsome in a roughcut , archaic , tragic way in the blocked light and shadows from the hanging lamp across the street . " You 're the only one , " Noah said , " I felt I could trust in the whole Company . " Suddenly he grabbed the two sheets of paper . " O.K. , " he said , " if you do n't want to help , the hell with you . . . " " Wait a minute , " Michael said , feeling dully that somehow he rnust prevent this savage and ludicrous joke from being played out to its limit . " I have n't said I wo n't help . " " O.K. , then , " Noah said harshly . " Go in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There are ten of them . What do you want me to do  --  fight them in one night ? I have to space them . Find out who wants to fight me first , who wants to fight me second , and so on . I do n't care how they come . " Michael took the sheets of paper silently from Noah 's hand and looked at the names on the list . Slowly he began to place the names . " You know , " he said , " that these are the ten biggest men in the com-pany. "  | " I know . " " Not one of them weighs under a hundred and eighty pounds . " " I know . " " How much do you weigh ? " " A hundred and thirty-five . " " They 'll kill you . " " I did n't ask you for advice , " Noah said evenly . " I asked you to make the arrangements . That 's all . Leave the rest to me . " " I do n't think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'll allow it , " said Noah . " That son of a bitch will allow it . Do n't worry about that . " Michael shrugged . " What do you want me to arrange ? " he asked , " I can get gloves and two-minute rounds and a referee and . . . " I do n't want any rounds or any referees , " Noah said . " When one of the men ca n't get up any more , the fight will be over . " Michael shrugged again . " What about gloves ? " " No gloves . Bare fists . Anything else ? " " No , " said Michael . " That 's all . " " Thanks , " Noah said . " Let me hear how you make out . " Without saying good-bye , he walked stiffly down the Company street . Michael watched the shadowy , erect back vanishing in Off darkness . Then he shook his head once and walked slowly toward the , barracks door , looking for the first man , Peter Donnelly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought heavyweight i the Golden Gloves in Miami in 1941 and had not been put out un the semi-final round . Donnelly knocked Noah down . Noah sprang up and jumped in air to reach Donnelly 's face . Donnelly began to bleed from the and he sucked in the blood at the corner of his mouth , with a look surprise and anger that supplanted the professional expression lie IN been fighting with until now . He held Noah 's back with one lift ignoring the fierce tattoo of Noah 's fists on his face , and palled In toward him . He swung , a short , chopping vicious blow , and the watching silently went " Ah . " Donnelly swung again as Noah fell Noah lay at his feet on the grass . " I think , " Michael said , stepping forward , " that that 's enough 1 this . . . " Get the hell out of here , " Noah said thickly , pushing himself 1 from the ground with his two hands.  |p325He  stood before Donnelly , wavering , blood filling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung , like a man throwing a baseball . There was the noise again , as it hit Noah 's mouth , and the men watching went " Ah , " again . Noah staggered back and fell against them , where they stood in a tight , hard-eyed circle , watching . Then he slid down and lay still . Michael went over to him and kneeled down . Noah 's eyes were closed and he was breathing evenly . " All right . " Michael looked up at Donnelly . " Hurray for you . You won . " He turned Noah over on his back and Noah opened his eyes , but there was no light of reason in them as they stared thoughtlessly tip at the evening sky . Quietly the circle of watching men broke up and started to drift away . " What do you know , " Michael heard Donnelly say as Michael put his hand under Noah 's armpit and lifted him slowly to his feet . " What do you know , the little bastard gave me a bloody nose . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watching Noah , bent over one of the sinks , washing his face with cold water . Noah was bare to the waist , and there were huge red blotches on his skin . Noah lifted his head . His right eye was closed by now , and the blood had not stopped coming from his mouth . He spat , and two teeth came out , in a gob of red . Noah did n't look at the teeth , lying in the basin . He dried his face thoughtfully with his towel , the towel staining quickly . " All right , " Michael said , " I think that did it . I think you 'd better cancel the rest . . . " Who 's the next man on the list ? " " Listen to me , " Michael said . " They 'll kill you finally . " " The next man is Wright , " Noah said flatly . " Tell him I 'll be ready for him three nights from now . " Without waiting for Michael to say anything , Noah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latrine door . Michael looked after him , shrugged , took another drag on his cigatte , threw the cigarette away and went out into the soft evening . le did not go into the barracks because he did n't want to see Ackerwanagain that evening . Wright was the biggest man in the company . Noah did not try to avoid him . He stood up , in a severe , orthodox boxing pose , andP326flashed swiftly in and out among the flailing slow hands , cutting , Wright 's face , making him grunt when he hit him in the stomach . Amazing , Michael thought , watchir Noah with grudging admire tion , he really knows how to box , where did he pick it up ? " In the belly , " Rickett called from his post in the inner circle of the ring , " in the belly , you dumb bathtard ! " A moment later it was ; ill over , because Wright swung sideways , all his weight behind a round , crushing swing . The knotted , hammer-like fist crashed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall on his hands and knees , face down , tongue hanging thickly out of his open mouth , gasping helplessly for air . The men who were watching looked on silently . " Well ? " said Wright , belligerently , standing over Noah . " Well ? " " Go home , " Michael said . " You were wonderful . " Noah began to breathe again , the air struggling through his throat in hoarse , agonized whistles . Wright touched Noah contemptuously with his toe and turned away , saying , " Who 's going to buy me a beet ? " The doctor looked at the x-rays and said that two ribs were broken . He taped Noah 's chest with bandage and adhesive , and made Noah lie still in the infirmary bed . " Now , " Michael said , standing over Noah in the ward , " now , wiq you quit ? " I " The doctor says it will take three weeks , " Noah said , the speech coming painfully through his pale lips . " Arrange the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Michael . " I wo n't do it . " " Deliver your goddamn lectures some place else , " Noah whisperc " If you wo n't do it , you can leave now . I 'll do it myself . " " What do you think you 're doing ? " Michael asked . " What do yc think you 're proving ? " Noah said nothing . He stared blankly and wildly across the ward the man with a broken leg who had fallen off a truck two days bcfcxa " What are you proving ? " Michael shouted . " Nothing , " Noah said . " I enjoy fighting . Anything else ? " " No , " said Michael . " Not a thing . " He went out . " Captain , " Michael was saying , " it 's about Private Ackerman . " Colclough was sitting very erect , the little roll of fat under his chi0P327lapping over his tight collar , making him look like a man who was slowly being choked . " Yes , " Colclough said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard about the ... uh ... dispute ... that Private Ackerman is engaged in withten members of the Company . " Colclough 's mouth lifted a little in an amused grin . " I 've heard something about it , " he said . " I think Private Ackerman is not responsible for his actions at this time , " Michael said . " He is liable to be very seriously injured . Permanentlyinjured . And I think , if you agreed with me , it might be a good idea to try to stop him from fighting any more ... " Colclough put his finger in his nose . He picked slowly at some obstaclethere , then pulled his finger out and examined the treasure he had withdrawn . " In an army , Whitacre , " he said in the even , - sober tone which he must have heard from officiating ministers at so many funerals in Joplin , " a certain amount of friction between the men is unavoidable . I believe that the healthiest way of settling that friction is by fair and open fighting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to much worse than fists later on , much worse . Shot and shell , Whitacre , " he said with grave relish . " Shot and shell . It would be unmilitary to forbid them to settle their differences now in this way , unmilitary . It is my policy , also , Whitacre , to allow as much freedom in handling their affairs as possible to the men in my Company , and I would not think of interfering . " " Yes , Sir , " said Michael . " Thank you , Sir . " He saluted and went out . Walking slowly down the Company street , Michael made a sudden decision . He could not remain here like this . He would apply for Officer Candidates ' School . When he had first come into the Army , lie had resolved to remain an enlisted man . First , he felt that he was a little too old to compete with the twenty-year-old athletes who made up the bulk of the candidate classes . And his brain was too set in its ways to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had held back from being put into a position where the lives of other men , so many other men , would depend upon his judgment . lie had never felt in himself any talent for military command . War , in all its thousand , tiny , mortal particulars , seemed to him , even after all the months of training , like an impossible , deadly puzzle . It was all right to work at the puzzle as an obscure , single figure , at someoneelse 's command . But to grapple with it on your own initiative ... to send forty men at it , where every mistake might be compoundedinto forty graves ... But now there was nothing else to do . If the Army felt that men like Colclough could be entrusted with two hundred and fifty lives , then no over-nicety of self-assessmeut , no modesty or fear of responsibility should hold one back . Tomorrow , Michael thought , I 'll fill in the form and hand it in to the orderly room . And , he thought grimly , in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infirmary with broken ribs .. . Five weeks later , Noah was back in the infirmary again . Two more teeth had been knocked out of his mouth , and his nose had been smashed . The dentist was making him a bridge so that he could eat , and the surgeon kept taking crushed pieces of bone out of his nose on every visit . By this time Michael could hardly speak to Noah . He came to the infirmary and sat on the end of Noah 's bed , and they both avoided each other 's eyes , and were glad when the orderly came through , crying , " All visitors out . " Noah had worked his way through five of the list by now , and his face was crooked and lumpy , and one ear was permanently disfigured in a flat , creased cauliflower . His right eyebrow was split and a white scar ran diagonally across it , giving the broken eyebrow a wild , interrogatingtwist . The total effect of his face , the steady , wild eyes , staring . out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the eighth fight , Noah was in the infirmary again . He had been hit in the throat . The muscles there had been temporarily paralyzed and his larynx had been injured . For two days the doctor was of the opinion that he would never be able to speak again . " Soldier , " the doctor had said , standing over him , a puzzled look on his simple college-boy face , " I do n't know what you 're up to , but whatever it is I do n't think it 's worth it . I 've got to warn you that it is impossible to lick the United States Army singlehanded ... " 110 leaned down and peered troubledly at Noah . " Can you say any thing ? " Noah 's mouth worked for a long time , without sound . Then a hoarse , croaking small noise came from between the swollen lips . The doctor bent over closer . " What was that ? " he asked . " Go peddle your pills , Doc , " Noah said , " and leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice boy but he was not accustomed r to being talked to that way any more , now that he was a Captain . P329He straightened up . " I 'm glad to see , " he said stiffly , " that you 've regained the gift of speech . " He wheeled and stalked out of the ward . Fein , the other Jew in the Company , came into the ward . too . He stood uneasily next to Noah 's bed , twisting his cap in his large hands . " Listen , Pal , " he said , " I did n't want to interfere here , but enough 's enough . You 're going at this all wrong . You ca n't start swinging every time you hear somebody say Jew bastard ... " " Why not ? " Noah grimaced painfully at him . " Because it ai n't practical , " Fein said . " That 's why . First of all , you ai n't big enough . Second of all , even if you was as big as a house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't do no good . There 's a certain number of people in this world that say Jew bastard automatically , and nothing you do or I do or any Jew does will ever change ' em . And this way , you make the rest of the guys in the outfit think all Jews 're crazy . Listen , they 're not so bad , most of ' em . They sound a lot worse than they are , because they do n't know no better . They started out feeling sorry for you , but now , after all these goddamnfights , they 're beginning to think Jews are some kind of wild animal . They 're beginning to look at me queer now ... " " Good , " Noah said hoarsely . " Delighted . " " Listen , " Fein said patiently , " I 'm older than you and I 'm a peacefulman . I 'll kill Germans if they ask me to , but I want to live in peace with the guys around me in the Army . The best equipment a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these bastards start to shoot their mouths off about the Jews that 's the ear you turn that way , the deaf one . . . You let them live and maybe they 'll let you live . Listen , the war ai n't going to last forever , and then you can pick your company . Right now , the government says you got to live with these miserable Ku Kluxers , O.K. , what 're you going to do about it ? Listen , Son , if all the Jews 'd been like you we'd 've all been wiped out 1000 years ago .. . " " Good , " Noah said . " Ah , " Fein said disgustedly , " maybe they 're right , maybe you are cracked . Listen , I weigh two hundred pounds , I could beat anyone in this Company with one hand tied behind me . But you ai n't noticed me fightin ' , do you ? I ai n't had a fight since I put on the uniform . I 'm a practical man ! " Noah sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " He 's in no condition to listen to the advice of practical men . "  |p330Fein  stared at him heavily , groping despairingly with the problem . " The question I ask myself , " he said , " is what do you want , what in hell do you want ? " Noah grinned painfully . " I want every Jew , " he said , " to be treated as though he weighed two hundred pounds . " " It ai n't practical , " Fein said . " Ah , the hell with it , you want to fight , go ahead and fight . I 'll tell you the truth , I feel I understand these Georgia crackers who did n't wear shoes till the Supply Sergeant put them on their feet better than I understand you . " IIe put on leis cap with ponderous decision . " Little guys , " he said , " that 's a race all by itself . I ca n't make head or tail of them . " And he went out , showing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bullet head , his complete disapproval of the bat  --  tered boy in the bed , who by some trick and joke of Fate and registra  --  tion was somehow linked with him . It was the last fight and if he stayed down it would be all over . He peered bloodily up from the ground at Brailsford , standing above him in pants and undershirt . Brailsford seemed to flicker against the white ring of faces and the vague wash of the sky . This was the second time Brailsford had knocked him down . But he had closed Brailsford 's eye and made him cry out with pain when he hit him in the belly . If he stayed down , if he merely stayed where he was on one knee , shaking his head to clear it , for another five seconds , the whole thing would be over . The ten men would be behind him , the . broken bones , the long days in the hospital , the nervous vomiting on the days when the fights were scheduled , the dazed , sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand up once more and face the onrushing , confident , hating faces and the clubbing fists . Five seconds more , and it would be proved . He would have done ; it . Whatever he had set out to demonstrate , and it was dim and anguished now , would have been demonstrated . They would have to realize that he had won the victory over them . Nine defeats and one default would not have been enough . The spirit only won when it made the complete tour of sacrifice and pain . Even these ignorant , brutal men would realize now , as he marched with them , marched first down the Florida roads , and later down the roads swept by gun  --  fire , that he had made a demonstration of will and courage that only the best of them could have been capable of .. . All he had to do was to remain on one knee . P331He stood up . He put up his hands and waited for Brailsford to come at him . Slowly , Brailsford 's face swam into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was very nervous . Noah walked across the patch of grass and hit the white face , hard , and Brailsford went down . Noah stared dully at the sprawled figure at his feet . Brailsford was panting hard , and his hands were pulling at the grass . " Get up you yellow bastard , " a voice called out from the watching men . Noah blinked . It was the first time anyone but himself had been cursed on this spot . Brailsford got up . He was fat and out of condition , because he was the Company Clerk and always managed to find excuses to duck out of heavy work . His breath was sobbing in his throat . As Noah moved in on him , there was a look of terror on his face . His hands waved vaguely in front of him . " No , no . . . " he said pleadingly . Noah stopped and stared at him . He shook his head and plodded in . Both men swung at the same time , and Noah went down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hit high on Noah 's temple . Methodically , sitting with his legs crumpled under him , Noah took a deep breath . He looked up at Brailsford . The big man was standing above him , his hands held tightly before him . He was breathing heavily , and he was whispering , " Please , please ... " Sitting there , with his head hammering , Noah grinned , because he knew what Brailsford meant . He was pleading with Noah to stay down . " Why , you miserable hillbilly son of a bitch , " Noah said clearly . " I 'm going to knock you out . " He stood up and grinned as he saw the flare of anguish in Brailsford 's eyes when he swung at him . Brailsford hung heavily on him , clinching , swinging with a great Nhow of willingness . But the blows were soft and nervous and Noah did n't feel them . Clutched in the big man 's fat embrace , smelling the sweat rolling off his skin , Noah knew that he had beaten Brailsfordmerely by standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Brailsford 's nerve had run out . Noah ducked away and lashed out at Brailsford 's middle . The blow landed and Noah could feel the softness of the clerk 's belly as his fist dng in . Brailsford dropped his hands to his sides and stood there , weaving a little , a stunned plea for pity in his eyes . Noah chuckled . " Here itp332comes , Corporal , " he said , and drove at the white , bleeding face . Brailsford just stood there . He would n't fall and he would n't figlit and Noah merely stood flat on the balls of his feet , hooking at the collapsing face . " Now , " he said , swinging with all his shoulder , all his body behind the driving , cutting blow . " Now . Now . " He gained in power . He could feel the electric life pouring down his arms into his fists . All his enemies , all the men who had stolen his money , cursed him on the march , driven his wife away , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Blood sprayed from his knuckles every time he hit Brailsford 's staring , agonized face . " Do n't fall , Corporal , " Noah said , " do n't fall yet , please do n't fall , " and swung again and again , faster and faster , his fists making a sound like mallets wrapped in wet cloth . And when he saw Brailsfordfinally begin to sway , he tried to hold him with one hand long enough to hit him twice more , three times , a dozen , and he sobbed when he no longer could hold the rubbery bloody mess up . Brailsford slipped to the ground . Noah turned to the watching men . He dropped his hands . No one would meet his eyes . " All right , " he said loudly . " It 's over . " But they did n't say anything . As though at a signal , they turned their backs and started to walk away . Noah stared at the retreating forms , dissolving in the dusk among the barracks walls . Brailsford still lay where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help him . Michael touched Noah . " Now , " Michael said , " let 's wait for the German Army . " Noah shook off the friendly hand . " They all walked awav , " he said . " The bastards just walked away . " He looked down at Brailsford . The clerk had come to , although he still lay face down on the grass . Ilc was crying . Slowly and vaguely he moved a hand up to his eyes . Noah went over to him and kneeled beside him . " Leave your eye alone , " he ordered . " You 'll rub dirt in it this way . " He started to pull Brailsford to his feet and Michael helped him . They had to support the clerk all the way to the barracks and they had to wash his face for him and clean the cuts because Brailsford just stood in front of the mirror with his hands at his side , weeping helplessly . The next day Noah deserted . Michael was called down to the orderly room . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is who , Sir ? " Michael asked , standing stiffly at attention . " You know goddamn well who I mean , " Colclough said . " Your friend . Where is he ? " " I do n't know , Sir , " said Michael . " Do n't hand me that ! " Colclough shouted . All the Sergeants were in the room behind Michael , staring gravely at their Captain . " You were his friend , were n't you ? " Michael hesitated . It was hard to describe their relationship as friendship . " Come on , Soldier ! You were his friend . " " I suppose so , Sir . " " I want you to say yessir or nosir , that 's all , Whitacre ! Were you his friend or were n't you ? " " Yes , Sir , I was . " " Where did he go ? " " I do n't know , Sir . " " You 're lying to me ! " Colclough 's face had grown very pale and his nose was twitching . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you something , Whitacre , in case you 've forgotten your Articles of War . The penalty for assisting at or failing to report desertion is exactly the same as for desertion . Do you know what the penalty for that is in time of war ? " " Yes , Sir . " " What is it ? " Suddenly Colclough 's voice had become quiet and : almost soft . He slid down in his chair and looked up gently at Michael . " It can be death , Sir . " " Death , " said Colclough , softly . " Death . Listen , Whitacre , your friend is as good as caught already . When we catch him , we 'll ask him if you , helped him desert . Or even if he told you he was going to desert . That 's all that 's necessary . If he told you and you did n't report it , that is just the same as assisting at desertion . Did you know that , Whitacre ? " " Yes , Sir , " Michael said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be happening to me , this is an amusing anecdote I heard at a cocktail party about the quaint characters in the United States Army . " I grant you , Whitacre , " Colclough said reasonably , " I do n't think court-martial would condemn you to death just for not reporting it . But they might very well put you in jail for twenty years . Or thirtyp334years . Or life . Federal prison , Whitacre , is not Hollywood . It is not Broadway . You will not get your name in the columns very often ill Leavenworth . If your friend just happens to say that he happened to tell you he planned to go away , that 's all there is to it . And he 'll get plenty of opportunities to say it , Whitacre , plenty .. . Now ... " Colclough spread his hands reasonably on the desk . " I do n't want to make a big thing out of this . I 'm interested in preparing a company to fight and I do n't want to break it up with things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me where Ackerman is , and we 'll forget all about it . That 's all . Just tell me where you think he might be . .. That 's not much , is it ? " " No , Sir , " Michael said . " All right , " Colclough said briskly . " Where . did he go ? " " I do n't know , Sir . " Colclough 's nose started to twitch again . He yawned nervously . " Listen , Whitacre , " he said , " do n't have any false feelings of loyalty to a man like Ackerman . He was not the type we wanted in the Coin pany , anyway . He was useless as a soldier and he was not trusted by any of the other men in the Company and he was a constant source of trouble from beginning to end . You 'd have to be crazy to risk spending your life in jail to protect a man like that . I do n't like to see you do it , Whitacre . You 're an intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can be a good soldier , Whitacre , ill time , and I want to help you ... Now .. . " And he smiled will . ningly at Michael . " Where is Private Ackerman ? " " I 'm sorry , Sir . " Michael said . " I do n't know . " Colclough stood up . " All right , " he said quietly . " Get out of here , Jew-lover . " " Yes , Sir , " Michael said . " Thank you , Sir . " He saluted and went out . Brailsford was waiting for Michael outside the mess hall . lie leaned against the building , picking his teeth and spitting . He had grown fatter than ever , but a look of uncertain grievance had set up residence in his features , and his voice had taken on a whining , ccnu  --  plaining note since Noah had beaten him . Michael saw him wavinK to him as Michael came out the door , heavy with the porkchops and potatoes and spaghetti and peach pie of the noonday meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company Clerk . But Brailsford hmp335ried after him , calling , " Whitacre , wait a minute , will you ? " Michael turned and faced Brailsford . " Hello , Whitacre , " Brailsford said . " I 've been looking for you . " " What 's the matter ? " Michael asked . Brailsford looked around him nervously . Other men were coming out of the mess hall and passing them in a food-anchored slow flood . " We better not talk here , " he said . " Let 's take a little walk . " " I have a couple of things to do , " Michael said , " before formation . . . " " It 'll only take a minute . " Brailsford winked solemnly . " I think you 'll be interested . " Michael shrugged . " O.K. , " he said , and walked side by side with the Company Clerk toward the parade ground . " This Company , " Brailsford said . " I 'm getting good and pissed-off with it . I 'm working on a transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a medical discharge , arthritis , and I 've been talking to a couple of people over there . This Company gives me the willies ... " Michael sighed . He had planned to go back to his bunk and lie down in the precious twenty minutes after dinner . " Listen , " he said , " what 's on your mind ? " " Ever since that fight , " Brailsford said , " these bastards have been pissing on me . Listen , I did n't want to sign my name on that list . It was a joke , see , that 's what they told me , the ten biggest guys in the Company , and I was one of them . I got nothing against the Jew . They told me he 'd never fight . I did n't want to fight . I 'm no fighter . Every kid in town used to lick me , even though I was big . What the hell , that ai n't no crime , not being a pugilist , is it ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I have no resistance . I had pneumonia when I was fourteen , and ever since then I have no resistance . I 'm even excused from hikes by the doctor . Try and tell that bastard Itickett that , " his said bitterly . " Or any of the others . They treat me like I sold military secrets to the German Army , ever since Ackermanknocked me out . I stood there and took it as long as I could , did n't I ? I stood there and he hit me and hit me and I did n't go down for a long time , is n't that true ? " " Yes , " said Michael . " That Ackerman is ferocious , " Brailsford said . " He may be small , but he 's wild . I do n't like to have no dealings with people like that.  |p336After  all , he gave Donnelly a bloody nose , did n't he , and Donnelly was in the Golden Gloves . What the hell do they expect from me ? " " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that . What 's on your mind now ? " " I ai n't got no future in this Company , no future at all . " Brailsfordthrew away his toothpick and stared sorrowfully across the dusty parade ground . " And what I want to tell you is neither have you ... Michael stopped . " What 's that ? " he said sharply . " The only people that 've treated me like a human being , " Brails  --  ford said , " are you and the Jew that night , and I want to help you . I 'd like to help him , too , if I could , I swear I would ... " " Have you heard anything ? " Michael asked . " Yeah , " said Brailsford . " They got him at Governor 's Island , in New York , last night . Remember , nobody is supposed to know this , it 's secret , but I know because I 'm in the orderly room all the time ... " " I wo n't tell anybody . " Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Military Police , wearing the blue fatigues with the big white P for prisoner stenciled on the back , and the guards with the shotguns walking behind him . " Is he all right ? " " I do n't know . They did n't say . Colclough gave us all a drink of Three Feathers to celebrate . That 's all I know . But that ai n't what I wanted to talk to you about . I wanted to tell you something about yourself . " Brailsford paused , obviously sourly pleased with the effect he was going to make in a moment . " Your application for OCS , " he said , " the one you put in a long time ago ... " " Yes ? " Michael asked . " What about it ? " " It came back , " Brailsford said . " Yesterday . Rejected . " " Rejected ? " Michael said dully . " But I passed the Board and I " " It came back from Washington , rejected . The other two guy$ from the Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said no . " The FBI ? " Michael stared sharply at Brailsford to see if this was some elaborate joke that was being played on him . " What 's the 1,141 got to do with it ? " " They check up , on everybody . And they checked up on you . You 're not officer material , they said . You 're not loyal . " " Are you kidding me ? " Michael asked . " Why the hell would I want to kid you ? " Brailsford asked ag-P337grievedly . " I do n't go in for jokes no more . You 're not loyal , they said , and that 's all there is to it . " " Not loyal . " Michael shook his head puzzledly . " What 's the matter with me ? " " You 're a Red , " said Brailsford . " They got it in the record . Dossier , the FBI calls it . You ca n't be trusted with information that might be of value to the enemy . " Michael stared out across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grass , and two soldiers were lazily throwing a baseball to each other . Across the parched brown and dead green the flag whipped in a light wind at the top of its pole . Somewherein Washington at this moment there was a man sitting at a desk , probably looking at the same flag on the wall of his office , and that man had calmly and without remorse written on his record . . . " Disloyal . Communist affiliation . Not recommended . " " Spain , " Brailsford said , " it 's got something to do with Spain . I sneaked a look at the report . Is Spain Communist ? " " Not exactly , " Michael said . " You ever been in Spain ? " " No . I helped organize a committee that sent ambulances and blood banks over there . " " They got you , " Brailsford said . " They got you cold . They wo n't tell you , either , they 'll just say you do n't have the proper qualities of cadetship or something like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Michael said . " Thanks a lot . " " What the hell , " Brailsford said , " at least you treat me like a human being . Take a tip . Try and wangle yourself a transfer . I ai n't got no future in this here Company , but you got a lot less . Colclough is crazy on the subject of Reds . You 'll do KP from now till we go overseas , and you 'll be first scout on every advance in combat , and I would n't give a used condom for your chances of coming out alive . " " Thanks , Brailsford , " Michael said . " I think I 'll take your advice . " " Sure , " Brailsford said . " A man 's got to protect his ass in this Army . It's. a cinch the Army ai n't interested in protecting it . " He took out another toothpick and poked between his teeth . He spat , reflectively . " Remember , " he said , " I ai n't said a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the parade ground , back to the orderly room in which he had no future . P338Far away , thin and metallic over the whispering thousand miles of wire , Michael heard Cahoon 's voice , saying , " Yes , this is Thoinn Cahoon . Yes , I 'll accept a collect call from Private Whitacre . . . " Michael closed the door of the telephone booth of the Rawlings Hotel . He had made the long trip into town because he did not u  --  unt to make the call from camp , where somebody might overhear him . " Please limit your call to five minutes , " the operator said . " There are others waiting . " " Hello , Tom , " he said . " It 's not poverty . It 's just that I do n't have the necessary quarters and dimes . " " Hello , Michael , " Cahoon said , sounding very pleased . " It 's an right . I 'll take it off my income tax . " " Tom , " Michael said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Special Services Division in New York , the people who put on shows and camp entertainments and things like that ? " " Yes , " Cahoon said . " Quite a few people . I work with them all the time . " " I 'm tired of the infantry , " Michael said . " Will you try to arran a transfer for me ? I want to get out of this country . There : i Special Services units going overseas every day . Can you get me int one of them ? " ' There was a slight pause at the other end of the wire . " Oh , Cahoon said , and there was a tinge of disappointment and repr in his voice . " Of course . If you want it . " " I 'll send you a special-delivery letter tonight , " Michael sai " Serial number , rank , and organization designation . You 'll ue that . " " Yes , " said Cahoon . " I 'll get right on it . " Still the slight cooln in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Michael said . " I ca n't explain why I 'm doi this over the phone . It will have to wait until I get there . " " You do n't have to explain anything to me , " Cahoon said . " Y know that . I 'm sure you have your reasons . " " Yes , " said Michael . " I have my reasons . Thanks again . Now have to get off . There 's an expectant Sergeant here who waist , call the maternity ward of the Dallas City Hospital . " " Good luck , Michael , " Cahoon said , and Michael could sense t effort at warmth that - Cahoon put into the words , almost co vincingly . " Good-bye . I hope I see you soon . "  | " Of course , " Cahoon said . " Of course you will . " Michael hung up and opened the door of the booth . He stepped out and a large , sad-looking Technical Sergeant , with a handful of quarters , flung himself onto the small bench under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked down the saloonlinedpavement , in the misty neon glow , to the USO establishment at the end of the block . He sat at one of the spindly desks among the sprawling soldiers , some of them sleeping in wrenched positions in the battered chairs , others writing with painful intensity at the desks . I 'm doing it , Michael thought , as he pulled a piece of paper toward him and opened his fountain pen , I 'm doing what I said I 'd never do , what none of these weary , innocent boys could never do . I 'm using my friends and their influence and my civilian privileges . Cahoon is right perhaps to be disappointed . It was easy to imagine what Cahoon must be thinking now , sitting near the phone , in his own apartment , over which he had just spoken to Michael . Intellectuals , Cahoon probably was thinking , they 're all alike , no matter what they say . Wheh it finally gets down to it , they pull back . When the sound of the guns finally draws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere . . . He would have to tell Cahoon about Colclough , about the man in the office at the FBI , who approved of Franco , but not of Roosevelt , who had your ultimate fate at the tip of his pencil , and against whom no redress , no appeal was possible . He would have to tell him about Ackerman and the ten bloody fights before the pitiless eyes of the Company . He would have to tell him what it was like to be under the command of a man who wanted to see you killed . Civilianscould n't really understand things like that , but he would have o try to tell . It was the big difference between civilian life and life n a military establishment . An American civilian always could feel hat he could present his case to some authorities who were comiittedto the idea of justice . But a soldier .. . You lost any hope f appeal to anyone when you put on your first pair of Army shoes . " ' fell it to the Chaplain , Bud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shit . Ile would try to explain it to Cahoon , and he knew Cahoon u mild try to understand . But even so , at the end , he knew that that little echo of disappointment would never finally leave Cahoon 's ice . And , being honest with himself , Michael knew that he wouldP340not blame Cahoon , because the echo of disappointment in himself would never fully leave his own consciousness , either . He started to write the letter to Cahoon , carefully printing out his serial number and organization , feeling , as he wrote the familiar ciphers that would seem so unfamiliar to Cahoon , that he was writing a letter to a stranger . P314I 'M AFRAID this may sound crazy , " Captain Lewis read , " and I 'm not crazy , and I do n't want anyone to think that I am . This is being written in the main reading room of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street at five o'clock in the afternoon . I have a copy of the Articles of War in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Churchill 's biography of the Duke of Marlborough and the man next to me is taking notes from Spinoza 's Ethics . I tell you these things to show you that I know what I am doing and that my powers of reason and observation are in no way impaired . . . " In all my time in the Army , " Captain Lewis said to the WAC secretary who sat at the next desk , " I never read anything like this . Where did we get this from ? " " The Provost Marshal 's office sent it over , " the WAC said . " They want you to go and look at the prisoner and tell them whether you think he 's faking lunacy or not . " " I am going to finish writing this letter , " Captain Lewis read , " and then I am going to get on the subway to the Battery and take the ferry to Governor 's Island , and give myself up . " Captain Lewis sighed , and for a moment he was sorry that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he felt , would simpler and more rewarding.  | " First of all , " the letter went on , in the nervous , irregular ban ( . writing on the flimsy paper , " I want to make it clear that no one helped me leave the camp , and no one knew that I was going to do it . My wife is not to be bothered , either , because I have refrained from going to see her or getting in touch with her in any way since I ar  --  rived in New York . I had to figure this question out and I did not wish to be swayed one way or another by any claims of sentiment . No one in New York has sheltered me or even spoken to me since 1 arrived two weeks ago , and I have not even by accident met anyone I ever knew . I have walked around most of the day and slept at night in various hotels . I still have seven dollars , which would have kept ins going for three or four more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the proper course that I must follow , and I do not wish to de . lay any longer . " Captain Lewis looked at his watch . He had a date for lunch in the city and he did n't want to be late . He got up and put on his coat and tucked the letter into his pocket , to be read on the ferry . " If anybody wants to know where I am , " Captain Lewis said to the WAC , " I am visiting the hospital . " " Yes , Sir , " the girl said gravely . Captain Lewis put on his cap and went out . It was a sunny , windy day , and across the harbor New York City , rooted in the green watcf , stood secure against the gale . Captain Lewis experienced the 1rs1131 little twinge when he saw the city standing there , peaceful , tall and ! shining , and hardly the place for a soldier to spend the war . But I saluted with snap and precision in answer to the salutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way down to the ferry , andfelt more soldierly by the time he went forward to the section of ti upper deck reserved for officers and their families . Captain Lewis w not a bad man , and he suffered often from pangs of guilt and co science , which he dutifully recognized . He would undoubtedly b ; i been brave and useful if the Army had put him into a place of dais and responsibility . But he was having a good time in New York . I lived at a good hotel at a cut military rate ; his wife remained honk Kansas City with the children , and he was sleeping with two gir who worked as models and did Red Cross things on the side , both them prettier and more expert than any girl he had ever known I fore . Every once in a while he woke up gloomily in the morning ; ii resolved that his time-wasting must come to a halt , that he must ; i%k for a more active assignment in a combat zone , or at least take soiiwP343steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Island . But after a morning or two of grumbling and cleaning out his desk and complaining to Colonel Bruce , he relaxed again and drifted back into the easygoing routine as before . " I have searched myself , " Captain Lewis read in the officers ' section of the ferry , as it throbbed at its moorings , " for the reasons that I have acted as I have done , and I believe I can state them honestly and understandably . The immediate cause of my action is the fact that I am a Jew . The men of my Company were mostly from the south , for the most part quite uneducated . Their attitude of mild hostility , which I believe had begun to wear away in respect to me , was suddenly fanned by a new Sergeant who was put in command of my platoon . Still , as I have said , I believe I would have taken this action even if I were not a Jew , although that brought it to a crisis and wade it impossible for me to continue living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ferry was moving toward the lower point of Manhattan . The city looked clean and everyday irrd dependable , and it was hard to think of a boy roaming its streets , leaded with all this misery , preparing to go to the reading room of the Library and there spill it out onto paper for the Provost Marshal to cad . God only knew what the MP 's had made out of the document . " I believe , " the letter went on , " that I must fight for my country . I lid not think so when I left camp , but I realize now that I was wrong Ilicn , that I did not see the issues clearly because of my preoccupa-t ion with my own troubles and a sense of bitterness toward the men round me , a sense of bitterness which was suddenly made unbearably . gong by something that happened on my last night in the camp . I'lie hostility of the Company had crystallized into a series of fistIn ; htswith me . I had been called upon to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt that I had to accept that challenge . " I had gone through nine of the fights , however , fighting honorably , . d asking for no quarter . In the last fight , I managed to beat the ncin who was opposing me . He knocked me down several times , but w the end , I knocked him out , as a culmination of many weeks of . The Company , which had watched all the fights , had before Il is left me on the ground , full of congratulations for the winner . In this instance , when I faced them , looking , perhaps foolishly , for some %1 , ; irk of admiration or grudging respect for what I had done , they turned , as one man , and walked away . It seemed to me as I there that I could not bear the fact that all I had done , all IP344had gone through to gain a place in the Company , had been absolutelywasted . " At that moment , looking at the backs of the men at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I decided to desert . " I realize now that I was wrong . I realize now that I believe in thli country and in this war , and an individual act like this is not possible I must fight . But I think I have the right to ask for a transfer to another division , where I can be among men who are more anxious to kill the enemy than they are to kill me . Respectfully , Noah Ackerman , Private , US Army . " The ferry docked and Captain Lewis slowly rose to his feet . Thoughtfully he folded the letter and put it into his pocket , as W crossed the gangplank to the wharf . Poor boy , he thought , and IN had an impulse to call off the lunch and go right back to the Islaid and seek Noah out . Ah , well , he thought , as long as I 'm here now , might as well have lunch and see him later . But I 'll make it quick he thought , and get back early . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I* had three old-fashioneds while waiting for a table , and after that Ny girl wanted to go home with him . She had been a little cool to hi the last three times he had been out with her and he felt he could risk leaving her now . Besides his head was a little fuzzy by now a he told himself he would have to be absolutely clear and sober w he went to see Noah , he owed it to the boy , it was the least he c do . So he went home with the girl and called his office and t Lieutenant Klauser to sign out for him after Retreat that aftcrnHe had a very good time with the girl and by five o'clock tic cided that he had been foolish to think that she had grown cool ward him , very foolish indeed . The visitor was very pretty , although a great deal of worry sec to be under severe control in her steady dark eyes . Also , Lewis she was pregnant . And from the look of her clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be even worse than he expected . " It was very good of you , " Hope said , " to get in touch with They have n't let me see Noah all this time , and they do n't let write me , and they wo n't deliver my letters to him . " Her voice cool and steady , and there was no tone of complaint in it .   " The Army , " Lewis said , feeling ashamed of all the men around kim , all the uniforms , guns , buildings . " It does things its own peculiar way , Mrs. Ackerman . You understand . " " I suppose so , " Hope said . " Is Noah well ? " " Well enough , " Lewis said diplomatically . " Are they going to let me see him ? " " I think so , " Lewis said . " That 's what I wanted to talk to you about . " He frowned at the WAG secretary , who was watching them I rom her desk with frank interest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , Sir . " The WAG rose reluctantly and went slowly out of the . oom . She had fat legs and the seams of her stockings were crooked , , is always . Why is it , Lewis thought automatically , why is it the dogs : ire the ones who join up ? Then he realized what he was thinking and gowned nervously , as though somehow the grave , steady-eyed girl : sated erectly in the stiff chair by the side of his desk could somehow cad his thoughts and , in the middle of her terrible dilemma , be , Hocked and disgusted by him . " I suppose , " Lewis said , " that you know something of what has one on , even though you have n't seen or heard from your husband . " " Yes , " said Hope . " A friend of his , a Private Whitacre , who was lawn in Florida with him , passed through New York and he came tome . " " Unfortunate , " Lewis said . " Most unfortunate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ironic smile played across the corners the girl 's mouth at his sympathy . " Now , " he said briskly , " this is the situation . Your husband has asked to be transferred to another u , anization . . . Technically , he can be tried by a court-martial on charge of desertion . " " But he did n't desert , " Hope said . " He gave himself up . " " Technically , " Lewis said , " he deserted , because at the time he left leis post , he did not intend to return . " " Oh , " said Hope . " There 's a rule for everything , is n't there ? " " I 'm afraid there is , " Lewis said uncomfortably . The girl made him w easy sitting there , staring steadily at him . It would have been easier it she cried . " However , " he went on stiffly , " the Army realizes that Here are extenuating circumstances . . . " Oh , God , " Hope said , laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in recognition of that , " Lewis insisted , " the Army isP346willing not to press the court-martial and return your husband to duty . " Hope smiled , a grave , warm smile . What a pretty girl , Lewis thought , much prettier than either of the two models .. . " Well , then , " Hope said , " there 's no problem , is there ? Noalr wants to be returned to duty and the Army is willing . .. " " It is n't as simple as that . The General in command of the base from which your husband deserted insists that he be returned to the Company in which he was serving , and the authorities here will not interfere . " " Oh , " Hope said flatly . " And your husband refuses to go back . He says he would stand trial before going back . " " They 'll kill him , " Hope said dully , " if he goes back . Is that what they want ? " " Now , now , " Lewis said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two bright Captain 's bars , he had to defend the Army to a certain extent , anyway . " It 's not as bad as that . " " No ? " Hope asked bitterly . " Just how bad would you say it wai6 Captain ? " " I 'm sorry , Mrs. Ackerman , " Lewis said humbly . " I know how y feel . And remember , I 'm trying to help ... " " Of course , " Hope said , touching his arm impulsively with h hand . " Forgive me . " " If he stands trial , he is quite certain to be sent to jail . " Lc paused . " For a long time . For a very long time . " He did not say ti he had written a biting letter to the Inspector General 's office abo this matter , and had put it in his desk to be reworked the next nio ing to get it perfect and that he had begun to think , as he had re r the letter , that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army had a quiet way of sending obstreperous officers , officers w found it necessary to make complaints about their superiors , topleasant places like Assam or Iceland or New Guinea . And he neglected to tell Hope that he had put the letter in his pocket and I re-read it four times during the day and then had torn it up at fi o'clock in the afternoon and had gone out and gotten drunk tl night . " Twenty years , Mrs. Ackerman , " he said as gently as posse " twenty-five years . Courts-martial have a tendency to harshness . " I know why you called me here , " Hope said in a dead voice . " Y want me to convince Noah to go back to his Company . "  |p347Lewis  swallowed . " That , more or less , is it , Mrs. Ackerman . " Hope stared out the window . Three prisoners in blue fatigues were heaving garbage into a truck . Two guards stood behind them , with shotguns under their arms . " Are you a psychiatrist in civilian life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ... uh ... yes , " Lewis said , flustered by the unexpected question . Hope laughed sharply . " Are n't you ashamed of yourself today ? " she asked . " Please , " Lewis said , stiffly . " Please . I have a job to do and I do it the best way I know how . " Hope stood up . She stood up heavily , carrying the child within her a little awkwardly . Her dress was too small for her and hung grotesquelyin front . Lewis had a sudden vision of Hope desperately trying to alter her clothes because she could not afford to buy maternity dresses . " All right , " she said , " I 'll do it . " " Good . " Lewis beamed at her . After all , he told himself , this was the best possible way for everybody , and the boy would not suffer too badly . Ile almost believed it , too , as he picked up the phone to call Captain Mason in the Provost Marshal 's office and tell him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mason 's extension and listened to the ringing in the receiver . " By the way , " he said to Hope , " does your husband know about ... the child ? " Delicately he avoided looking at the girl . " No , " Hope said . " He has n't any idea . " " You might .. . uh ... use that as an argument , " Lewis said , holding the buzzing phone to his ear . " In case he wo n't change his mind . For the child 's sake . .. a father in prison , disgraced .. . " It must be wonderful , " Hope said , " to be a psychiatrist . It makes , ) n so practical . " Lewis could feel his jaw growing rigid with embarrassment . " I did n't mean to suggest anything that ... " he began . " Please , Captain , " Hope said , " keep your silly mouth closed . " ) h , God , Lewis mourned within him , the Army , it makes idiots ( it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so badly in a gray . " Captain Mason , " a voice said in the receiver. " hello , Mason , " Lewis said gratefully . " I have Mrs. Ackermanp348here . Will you get Private Ackerman down to the visitors ' room right away ? " " You have five minutes , " the MP said . He stood at the door of the bare room , which had bars on the windows and two small wooded chairs in the middle of the floor . The main problem was not to cry . He looked so small . The otliel things , the queer , smashed shape of his nose , the grotesque brckcq ear , the split , torn eyebrow were bad , but what was hard to conquet was that he looked so small . The stiff blue fatigues were much tiq ' large for him and he seemed lost and tiny in them . And they nnade him seem heartbreakingly humble . Everything about him was ? nimble . Everything but his eyes . The soft way he came into the rcmny The mild , hesitant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haskiss , with the MP watching . His low , mild voice , when he sai " Hello . " It was dreadful to think of the long , cruel process which lia produced such humility in her husband . But his eyes flared wild and steadily . They sat almost knee to knee on the two stiff chairs like two 00 ladies having tea in the afternoon . " Well , now , " Noah said softly . " Well , now . " He grinned at lief gently . There were the sorrowful gaps , between the healed guars , where the teeth had been knocked out , and they gave a horrible all of stupidity and rudimentary cunning to the wrecked face . But Wlri acre had prepared her for the missing teeth , and her expression didn change at all . " Do you know what I think about all the time i here ? " " What ? " Hope asked . " What do you think about ? " " Something you once said . " " What was that ? " " You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . " ' He grinned as her , and not crying became a big problem again . " I remember jutl how you said it . " " What a thing , " Hope said , trying to smile , too . " What a thing to remember . " They stared at each other in silence , as though they had exhausted all conversation . " Your aunt and uncle , " Noah said . " They still live in Brooklyn ? The same garden ... " " Yes , " Hope said . The MP moved a little at the door , scratchingp349his back against the wood . The rough cloth made a sliding sound on the wood . " Listen , " Hope said , " I 've been talking to Captain Lewis . You know what he wants me to do .. : ' " Yes , " Noah said . " I know . " " I 'm not going to try to tell you , one way or another , " Hope said . " You do what you have to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes slowly dropping to her stomach , tight against the belt of the old dress . " I would n't promise him anything , " she went on , " not a thing ... " " Hope , " Noah said , staring fixedly at the swelling belt . " Tell me the truth . " Hope sighed . " All right , " she said . " Five more months . I do n't know why I did n't write you when I could . I have to stay in bed most of the time . I had to give up my job . The doctor says I 'll probably have a miscarriage if I keep on working . That 's probably why I did n't let you know . I wanted to be sure it was going to be all right . " Noah looked at her gravely . " Are you glad ? " he asked . " I do n't know , " Hope said , wishing the MP would fall to the floor in a dead faint . " I do n't know anything . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Noah sighed . Then he leaned over and kissed her forehead . " It 's wonderful , " he said . " Absolutely wonderful . " Hope glared at the MP , the bare room , the barred window . " What a place , " she said , " what a place to learn something like this . " The MP stolidly scratched his back along the frame of the door . " One more minute , " he said . " Do n't worry about me , " Hope said , swiftly , her words tumbling over each other . " I 'll be all right . I 'm going to my parents . They 'll take care of me . Do n't you worry at all . " Noah stood up . " I 'm not worried , " he said . " A child ... " He waved vaguely , in a stiff , boyish gesture , and even now , in this grim room , Hope had to chuckle at the dear , familiar movement . " Well , iiow ... " Noah said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked over to the window , and looked out through the bars at the enclosed clapboard courtyard . When he turned back to her his eyes seemed blank and lusterless . " Please , " he said , " please go to Captain Lewis and tell him I 'll go any place they send me . " " Noah ... " Hope stood up , half in protest , half in relief . " All right , " the MP said . " Time 's up . " He opened the door . Noah came over to her and they kissed . She took his hand andp350held it for a moment against her cheek . But the MP said , " All right , Lady , " and she went through the door . She turned before the NIP could close it again and saw Noah standing there , thoughtfully watching her . He tried to smile , but it did n't come out a smile . ' 1 ' 11cu the MP'closed the door , and she did n't see him again .    --  I 'M GOING to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry to see you back . You 're a disgrace to this Company and I do n't think we can make a soldier out of you in a hundred years . But by God , I 'm going to try , if I have to break you in half doing it . " Noah stared at the twitching pale spot gleaming at the end of the Captain 's nose . It was all the same , the same glaring light in the orderly room , the same stale joke pinned on the wall over the Top Sergeant 's desk , " The Chaplain 's number is 145 . Get your TS cards punched there . " Colclough had the same voice and he seemed to be saying the same thing , and even the smell , of badly seasoned wood , dusty papers , sweaty uniforms , gun oil and beer , hung in the orderly room . It was hard to realize that he had ever been away or that anything had happened or anything changed . " Naturally , you have no privileges . " Colclough was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get no passes and no furloughs . You will be on KP every day for the next two weeks , and after that you will have Saturday and Sunday KP from then on . Is that clear ? " " Yes , Sir , " Noah said . " You have the same bunk you had before . I warn you , Ackerman , ru will have to be five times more soldier than anybody in this just to keep alive . Is that clear ? "   " Yes , Sir , " Noah said . " Now get out of here .. I do n't want to see you in this orderly room again . That 's all . " " Yes , Sir . Thank you , Sir . " Noah saluted and went out . He walked slowly down the familiar Company street toward his old barracks , He felt a constriction in his throat as he saw its lights shining , through the bare windows fifty yards away and the familiar figure/ ' moving around within . Suddenly he wheeled . The three men who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Donnelly , Wrigh Henkel . He could see them grinning at him . They moved softly a almost imperceptibly toward him , in a spaced , dangerous line . " We are the welcoming committee , " Donnelly said . " The Co pany decided you should have a nice old-fashioned welcome wh you got back , and now we are going to give it to you . " Noah reached into his pocket . He ripped out the spring knife tha he had bought in town on the way to camp . He pressed the butto and the six-inch blade whickered out of its sheath . It caught till light , gleaming new and bright and deadly in his hand . The three men stopped when they saw the knife . " The next man that touches me , " Noah said quietly , " gets this . If anybody in this Company ever touches me again I 'm going to kill him . Pass the good word along . " He stood erect , the knife held at hip level in front of him . Donnelly looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two men . " Ah , " he said , " let 's leave him alone . For the time being . Ile ' @ nuts . " Slowly they moved away . Noah remained standing with tiro knife in front of him . " For the time being , " Donnelly said loudly . " Do n't forget I sa for the time being . " Noah grinned , watching them until they turned a corner a disappeared . He looked down at the long , wicked blade . Confident he snapped it closed and put it in his pocket . As he walked towa the barracks , he realized suddenly that he had discovered the tec nique of survival . But he hesitated for a long moment at the barracks door . From inside he could hear a man singing , " And then I hold your hand . And then you understand ... " Noah threw the door open and stepped in . Riker , near the dcxx , saw him . " My God , " he said , " look who 's here . " P353Noah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone handle of the knife . " Hey , it 's Ackerman , " Collins , across the room , said . " What do you know ? " Suddenly they were crowding around him . Noah backed unostentatiouslyagainst the wall , so that no one could get behind him . He fingered the little button that sprang the knife open . " How was it , Ackerman ? " Maynard said . " Did you have a good time ? Go to all the night clubs7 " The others laughed , and Noah flushed angrily , until he listened carefully to the laughter , and slowly realized that it did not sound threatening . " Oh , Christ , Ackerman , " Collins said , " you should have seen Colclough'sface the day you went over the hill ! It was worth joining the Army for . And did he eat Rickett 's ass out ! " All the men roared in fond memory of the day of glory . " How long were you gone , Ackerman ? " Maynard asked . " Two months ? " " Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Collins marveled . " Four weeks vacation ! I wish I had the guts to do it myself , I swear to God ... " " You look great , kid , " Riker clapped his shoulder . " It 's done you a world of good . " Noah stared at him , disbelievingly . This was another trick , and he kept his hand firmly on the knife . " After you left , " Maynard said , " three other guys took the hint and went AWOL . You set a style there , a real style . The Colonel came down and ate Colclough 's ass out , right in front of everybodv , wanted to know what the hell sort of company he was running , with everybody jumping the fence , the worst record of any company in camp , and all that crap . I thought Colclough was going to slit his throat . " " Here , " Burnecker said , " we found these under the barracks and I saved ' em for you . " He held out a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at Burnecker 's widely grinningbaby face . The three books were still there , slightly moldy , but readable . Noah shook his head slowly . " Thanks , " he said , " thanks , boys , " awl put the books down . He did not dare to turn and show the watching men what was going on in his face . Dimly , he realized thatP354his personal armistice with the Army had been made . It had N-cis made on lunatic terms , on the threat of the knife and the absiiid prestige of his opposition to authority , but it was real , and standing there , looking cloudily down on the tattered books on his bunk , with the voices of the other men a loud blur behind him , he knew that it probably would last , and might even grow into an alliance . P355THE PLATOON LIEUTENANT had been killed in the morning Arid Christian was in command when the order came to fall back . The Americans had not been pushing much and the battalion had been beautifully situated on a hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three Italian families grimly continued tee live . " I have begun to understand how the Army operates , " Christian licard a voice complain in the dark , as the platoon clanked along , in the dust . " A Colonel comes down and makes an examination . Then he goes back to Headquarters and reports . General , ' he Nays , I am happy to report that the men have warm , dry quarters , in safe positions which can only be destroyed by direct hits . They have finally begun to get their food regularly , and the mail is delivered three times a week . The Americans understand that their position r , impregnable and do not attempt any activity at all. ! ' Ah , good , ' says the General . We shall retreat . ' Christian recognized the voice . Private Dehn , he noted down silcntly for future reference . He marched dully , the Schmeisser on its sling already becoming a burden on his shoulder . He was always tired these days , and the malaria headaches and chills kept coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsettling . Going back , his boots seemed to sound as he limped in the dust , going back , going back .. . At least , he thought heavily , we do n't have to worry about the planes in the dark . That pleasure would be reserved for later , when the sun came up . Probably back near Foggia , in a warm room , a young American Lieutenant was sitting down now to a breakfast of grape  --  fruit juice , oatmeal , ham and eggs , and real coffee with cream , preparing to climb into his plane a little later and come skimming ovcf the hills , his guns spitting at the black , scattered blur of men , crouched insecurely in shallow holes along the road , that would be Christian and the platoon . As he plodded on , Christian hated the Americans . He hated them more for the ham and eggs and the real coffee than for the bullets and the planes . Cigarettes , too , he thought . Along with everything else , they have all the cigarettes they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had all those cigarettes ? His tongue ached ferociously for the healing smoke of a cigarette . But he only had two cigarettes in his pack , and he had rationed himself to one a day . Christian thought of the faces of the American pilots he had seen , men who had been shot down behind the German lines and had waited to be taken , insolently smoking cigarettes , with arrogant smiles on their empty , untouched faces . Next time , he thought , next tuna I see one of them , I 'm going to shoot him , no matter what the orders are . Then he stumbled in a rut . He cried out , as the pain knotted in his knee and hip . " Are you all right , Sergeant ? " asked the man behind him . j " Do n't worry about me , " Christian said . " Stay on the side of thi road . " He limped on , not thinking about anything any more , except the road in front of him . The runner from battalion was waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would . The platoon had been walking for two hours , and it was broad daylight by now . They had heard planes , on the other side of tie small range of hills the platoon had been skirting , but they had iiol been attacked.  |p357The  runner was a Corporal , who had hidden himself nervously in the ditch alongside the road . The ditch had six inches of water in it , but the Corporal had preferred safety to comfort , and he rose from the ditch muddy and wet . There was a squad of Pioneers on the other side of the bridge , waiting to mine it after Christian 's platoon had gone through . It was not much of a bridge , and the ravine which it crossed was dry and smooth . Blowing the bridge would n't delay anyone more than a minute or two , but the Pioneers doggedly blew everything blowable , as though they were carrying out some ancient religious ritual . " You 're late , " said the Corporal nervously . " I was afraid something had happened to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Christian shortly . " Very well , " said the Corporal . " It 's only another three kilometers . The Captain is going to meet us , and he will show you where you are to dig in . " He looked around nervously . The Corporal always looked like a man who expects to be shot by a sniper , caught in an open field by a strafing plane , exposed on a hill to a direct hit by an artillery shell . Looking at him , Christian was certain that the Corporalwas going to be killed very shortly . Christian gestured to the men and they started over the bridge behind the Corporal . Good , Christian thought dully , another three kilometers and then the Captain can start making decisions . The squad of Pioneers regarded them thoughtfully from their ditch , withoutlove or malice . Christian crossed the bridge and stopped . The men behind him halted automatically . Almost mechanically , without any conscious will on his part , his eye began to calculate certain distances , probable approaches , fields of fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Corporal , peering shiftily past the platoon , down the road on which later in the day the Americanswould appear . " What are you stopping for ? " " Keep quiet , " Christian said . He walked back across the bridge . He stood in the middle of the road , looking back . For a hundred meters the road went straight , then curved back around a hill , out of sight . Christian turned again and stared through the morning haze t the road and the hills before them . The road wound in mounting curves through the stony sparsely bushed hills in that direction . Far Off , eight hundred , a thousand meters away , on an almost cliff-likep358drop , there was an outcropping of boulders . Among those boulders , his mind registered automatically , it would be possible to set up a machine gun and it would also be possible to sweep the bridge and its approach from there . The Corporal was at his elbow . " I do not wish to annoy you , Sergeant , " the Corporal said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific . No delays , at all , he said , I will not take any excuses . " " Keep quiet , " said Christian . The Corporal started to say something . Then he thought better of it . He swallowed and rubbed his mouth with his hand . He stocxl at the first stone of the bridge and stared unhappily toward the south . Christian walked slowly down the side of the ravine to the dry stream bed below . About ten meters back from the bridge , he noticed , his mind still working automatically , the slope leading down from the road was quite gentle , with no deep holes or boulders . Under the bridge the stream bed was sandy and soft , with scattered worn stouel and straggling underbrush . It could be done , Christian thought , it would be simple . 11s climbed slowly up to the road again . The platoon had cautiously g off the bridge by now and were standing at the edge of the road oil the other side , ready to jump into the Pioneers ' ditches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian thought resentfully , we do n't live like human beings at all . The Corporal was jiggling nervously up and down at the entrap to the bridge . " All right , now , Sergeant ? " he asked . " Can we sta now ? " Christian ignored him . Once more he stared down the straig hundred meters toward the turn in the road . He half closed his cy and he could almost imagine how the first American , flat on h belly , would peer around the bend to make sure nothing was waitin for him . Then the head would disappear . Then another head , pro ably a Lieutenant 's ( the American Army seemed to have an infiiii number of Lieutenants they were willing to throw away ) , wou appear . Then , slowly , sticking to the side of the hill , peering ne ously down at their feet for mines , the squad , or platoon , or may even the company would come around the bend , and approach t bridge . Christian turned and looked again at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hill a thousand meters on the othp359side of the bridge . He was almost certain that from there , aside from being able to command the approach to the bridge and the bridge itself , he could observe the road to the south where it wound through the smaller hills they had just come through . He would be able to see the Americans for a considerable distance before they moved behind the hill from which they would have to emerge on the curve of the road that led up to the bridge . He nodded his head slowly , as the plan , full-grown and thoroughly worked out , as though it had been fashioned by someone else and presented to him , arranged itself in his mind . He walked swiftly across the bridge . He went over to the Sergeant who was in command of the Pioneers . The Pioneer Sergeant was looking at him inquisitively . " Do you intend to spend the winter on this bridge , Sergeant ? " the Pioneer said . " Have you put the charges under the bridge yet ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the Pioneer . " One minute after you 're past we light the fuse . I do n't know what you think you 're doing , but I do n't mind telling you you 're making me nervous , parading up and down this way . The Americans may be along at any minute and then .. . " Have you a long fuse ? " Christian asked . " One that would take , say , fifteen minutes to burn ? " " I have , " said the Pioneer , " but that is n't what we 're going to use . We have a one-minute fuse on the charges . Just long enough so that the man who sets them can get out of the way . " " Take it off , " said Christian , " and put the long fuse on . " " Listen , " said the Pioneer , " your job is to take these scarecrows lack over my bridge . My job is to blow it up . I wo n't tell you what to do with your platoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge . " Christian stared silently at the Sergeant . He was a short man who miraculously had remained fat . He looked like the sort of fat man who also had a bad stomach , and his air was testy and superior . " I will also require ten of those mines , " Christian said , with a gesture toward the mines piled haphazardly near the edge of the road . " I am putting those mines in the road on the other side of the bridge , " said the Pioneer . " The Americans will come up with their detectors and pick them up one by one , " said Christian.  | " That 's not my business , " said the Pioneer sullenly . " I was told to put them in here and I am going to put them in here . " " I will stay here with my platoon , " said Christian , " and make slits you do n't put them in the road . " " Listen , Sergeant , " said the Pioneer , his voice shivering in excitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Americans .. . " Pick those mines up , " Christian said to the squad of Pioneer% " and follow me. " i " See here , " said the Pioneer in a high , pained voice , " I give orders to this squad , not you . " " Then tell them to pick up those mines and come with me , " Christian coldly , trying to sound as much like Lieutenant Harde burg as possible . " I 'm waiting , " he said sharply . The Pioneer was panting in anger and fear now , and he had caught the Corporal 's habit of peering every few seconds toward the ben to see if the Americans had appeared yet . " All right , all right , " said . " It does n't mean anything to me . How many mines did you you want ? " " Ten , " said Christian . " The trouble with this Army , " grumbled the Pioneer , " is that there are too many people in it who think they know how to wiN the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his men to pick u the mines , and Christian led them down into the ravine and show them where he wanted them placed . He made the men cover t holes carefully with brush and carry away the sand they had dug in their helmets . Even while he supervised the men down below , he noticed , wi a grim smile , that the Pioneer Sergeant himself was attaching it long fuses to the small , innocent-looking charges of dynamite un the span of the bridge . " All right , " said the Pioneer gloomily , when Christian came on the road again , the trines having been placed to his satisfacti " the fuse is on . I do not know what you are trying to do , but I p it on to please you . Now , should I light it now ? " " Now , " said Christian , " please get out of here . " " It is my duty , " said the Pioneer pompously , " to blow up t bridge and I shall personally see that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuse lighted , " Christian said , quite pleasantly now , " until the Americans are almost here . If you wish personallyto stay under the bridge until that time , I personally welcome you .   " This is not a time for jokes , " said the Pioneer with dignity . " Get out , get out , " Christian shouted at the top of his voice , fiercely , menacingly , remembering with what good effect Hardenburg had used that trick . " I do n't want to see you here one minute from now . Get back or you 're going to get hurt ! " He stood close to the Pioneer , towering ferociously above him , his hands twitching , as though he could barely restrain himself from knocking the Pioneer senseless where he stood . The Pioneer backed away , his pudgy face paling under his helmet . " Strain , " he said hoarsely . " No doubt you have been under an enormous strain in the line . No doubt you are not quite yourself . " " Fast ! " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where his squad was again assembled on the other side of the bridge . He spoke briefly , in a low voice , and the squad clambered up from the ditch . Without a backward glance they started down the road . Christian watched them for a moment , but did not smile , as he felt like doing , because that might ruin the healthful effect of the episode on his own men . " Sergeant . " It was the Corporal , the runner from battalion , again , his voice drier and higher than ever . " The Captain is waiting . . . Christian wheeled on the Corporal . Ile grabbed the man 's collar and held him close to him . The man 's eyes were yellow and glazed with fright . " One more word from you , " Christian shook him roughly , and the man 's helmet clicked painfully down over his eyes , onto the bridge of his nose . " One ' more word and I will shoot you . " He pushed him away . " Dehn ! " Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platoon on the other side of the bridge and came toward Christian . " Come with me , " said Christian , when Dehn had reached him . Christian half-slid , half-walked down the side of the ravine , carefullyavoiding the small minefield he and the Pioneers had laid . He pointed to the long fuse that ran from the dynamite charge down the northern side of the arch . " You will wait here , " he said to the silent soldier standing beside him , " and when I give the signal , you will light that fuse . " Christian heard the deep intake of breath as Dehn looked at the fuse . " Where will you be , Sergeant ? " he asked . Christian pointed up the mountain to the outcropping of bouldersP362about eight hundred meters away . " Up there . Those boulders below the point where the road turns . Can you see it ? " There was a long pause . " I can see it , " Dehn whispered finally . The boulders glittered , their color washed out by distance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I will wave my coat , " said Christian . " You will have to watch carefully . You will then set tlufuseand make sure it is going . You will have plenty of time . l'lu u get out on the road and run until the next turn . Then wait until you hear the explosion here . Then follow along the road until you reach us . " Dehn nodded dully . " I am to be all alone down here ? " he asked . " No , " said Christian , " we will supply you with two ballet dancers and a guitar player . " Dehn did not smile . " Is it clear now ? " Christian asked . " Yes , Sergeant , " said Dehn . " Good , " Christian said . " If you set off the fuse before you see my coat , do n't bother coming back . " Dehn did not answer . He was a large , slow-moving young mau who had been a stevedore before the war , and Christian suspects d that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last look at his arrangements under the bridge , and at Dehn standing stolidly , leaning against the curved damp stone of the arch . Then he climbed up to the road again . Next time , Christian thought grimly , that soldier will be less free with criticism . It took fifteen minutes , walking swiftly , to reach the clump of boulders overlooking the road . Christian was panting hoarsely by the time he got there . The men behind him marched doggedly , as though resigned to the fact that they were doomed to march , bent under their weight of iron , for the rest of their lives . There was no troul ) lc about straggling , because it was plain to even the stupidest man ut the platoon that if the Americans got to the bridge before the platoon turned away out of sight behind the boulders , the platoon would present a fair target , even at a great distance , to the pursuers . Christian stopped , listening to his own harsh breathing , and peered down into the valley . The bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust of the road . There was no movement to be seen any place , and the long miles of broken valley seemed deserted , forgotten , lost to human use.  |p363Christian  smiled as he saw that his guess had been right about the vantage point of the boulders . Through a cut in the hills it was possible to see a section of the road some distance from the bridge . The Americans would have to cross that before they disappeared momentarily from sight behind a spur of rock , around which they would then have to turn and appear again on the way to the bridge . Even if they were going slowly and cautiously , it would not take them more than ten or twelve minutes to cover the distance , from the spot at which they would first come into sight , to the bridge itself . " Heims , " Christian said , " Richter . You stay with me . The rest of you go back with the Corporal . " He turned to the Corporal . The Corporal now looked like a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ten percent chance he may postpone the moment of execution till tomorrow . " Tell the Captain , " Christian said , " we will get back as soon as we can . " " Yes , Sergeant , " the Corporal said , nervous and happy . He started walking , almost trotting , to the blessed safety of the turn in the road . Christian watched the platoon file by him , following the Corporal . The road was high on the side of the hill now . When they walkcd , the men were outlined heroically and sadly against the shreds of cloud and wintry blue sky , and when they made their turns , one by one , in toward the hill , they seemed to step off into windy blue space . Heims and Richter were a machine-gun team . They were standheavily , leaning against the roadside boulders , Heims holding the barrel and a box of ammunition , and Richter sweating under the base and more ammunition . They were dependable men , but , looking at them , standing there , sweating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian felt suddenly that he would have preferred , at this moment , to have with him now the men of his old platoon , dead these long months in the African desert . He had n't thought about his old platoon for a long time , but somehow , looking at the two machine gunners , left behind on another hill this way , brought to mind the night more than a year before when the thirty-six men had thoughtfully and obediently dug the lonely holes which would a little later be their graves . Somehow , looking at Heims and Richter , he felt that these men could not be - depcndcd upon to do their jobs as well . They belonged , by some slight , subtle deterioration in quality , to another army , anP364army whose youth had left it , an army that seemed , with all its experience , to have become more civilian , less willing to die . If lie left the two men now , Christian thought , they would not stay at their posts for long . Christian shook his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're probably fine . God knows what they think of me , besides . The two men leaned , thickly relaxed against the stones , their eyes warily on Christian , as though they were measuring him and trying to discover whether he was going to ask them to die this morning . " Set it up here , " Christian said , pointing to a level spot between two of the boulders which made a rough v at their joining . Slowly but expertly the men set up the machine gun . When the gun was set up , Christian crouched down behind it and traversed it . He shifted it a little to the right and peered down the barrel . He adjusted the sight for the distance , allowing for the fact that they would be shooting downhill . Far below , caught on the fine iron line of the sight , the bridge lay in sunlight that changed momentarily to shadow as rags of cloud ghosted across the sky . " Give them plenty of chance to bunch up near the bridge , " Christiansaid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll think it 's mined . When I give you the signal to fire , aim at the men in the rear , not at the ones near the bridge . Do you understand ? " " The ones in the rear , " Heims repeated . " Not the ones near the bridge . " He moved the machine gun slowly up and down on its rocker . He sucked reflectively at his teeth . " You want them to run forward , not back in the direction they are coming from ... " Christian nodded . " They wo n't run across the bridge , because they are in the open there , " said Heims thoughtfully . " They will run for the ravine , under the bridge , because they are out of the field of fire there . " Christian smiled . Perhaps he had been wrong about Heims , he thought , he certainly knew what he was doing here . " Then they will run into the mines down there , " said Heirs flatly . " I see . " He and Richter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disapproval in their gesture . Christian took off his coat , so that he would be able to wave it in signal to Dehn , under the bridge , as soon as he saw the Americans , Then he sat on a stone behind Heims who was sprawled out behind the gun . Richter knelt on one knee , waiting with a second belt ofp365cartridges . Christian lifted the binoculars he had taken from the dead Lieutenant the evening before . He fixed them on the break between the hills . He focused them carefully , noticing that they were good glasses . There were two poplar trees , dark green and funereal , at the break in the road . They swayed glossily with the wind . It was cold on the exposed side of the hill , and Christian was sorry he had told Dchn he would wave his coat at him . He could have used his coat now . A handkerchief would probably have been good enough . He could feel his skin contracting in the cold and he hunched inside his stiff clothes uncomfortably . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " said Christian , without lowering the glasses . Neither of the men said anything . Cigarettes , thought Christian , remembering , I 'll bet he has a whole pack , two packs . If he gets killed or badly wounded in this , Christian thought , I must remember to look through his pockets . They waited . The wind , sweeping up from the valley , circled weightily within Christian 's ears and up his nostrils and inside his sinuses . His head began to ache , especially around the eyes . He was very sleepy . He felt that he had been sleepy for three years . Heims stirred as he lay outstretched , belly down , on the rockbed in front of Christian . Christian put down the glasses for a moment . The seat of Heims 's trousers , blackened by mud , crudely patched , wide and shapeless , stared up at him . It is a sight , Christian thought foolishly , repressing a tendency to giggle , a sight completely lacking in beauty . The human form divine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English , not enough the French , the Poles , the Russians , the Americans , but the mosquitoes , too . Perhaps , he thought feverishly and cunningly , perhapswhen this is over , I will have a real attack , one that can not be denied , and they will have to send me back . He raised the glasses once more to his eyes , waiting for the chills to come , inviting the toxin in his blood to gain control . Then he saw the small mud-colored figures slowly plodding in front of the poplars . " Quiet , " he said warningly , as though the Americans could hear Heims and the other man if they happened to speak . The mud-colored figures , looking like a platoon in any army , the fatigue of their movement visible even at this distance , passed in
