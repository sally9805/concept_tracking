Baseball 's Midsummer Night 's Dream - the annual All Star game-was more like a dull nightmare . Not a single home run was scored . The American League team failed to make even a single extra-base hit . When it all finally came to an end in Pittsburgh last week , the Nationals had won by 7-to-1 , the most lopsided score in the twelve-year-old series . <P> But baseball 's impresarios , who mark success by gate receipts , were not downcast . For the fans , although they had known what to expect , had poured out some $80,000 to watch the exhibition . The 29,589 paid admissions to the All Star game were another indication that baseball , in the throes of its third wartime year , is doing much better than anyone had thought possible . <P> Competition Counts . So far this year , average daily attendance has been about 8.000 a game , a third higher than last year . The boom could probably be accounted for by the fact that in baseball close competition draws better than brilliant play . Talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it ever been so evenly distributed . <P> This happy circumstance was no fault of management . To spur their teams into early leads , dugout bosses had grabbed up 4-F 's , imported foreigners , recalled rusty old men , hired war workers on their days off , distributed daily doses of vitamins . <P> But by last week 's mid-season recess , few of these efforts toward superiority had availed . The American League clubs , with the St. Louis Browns leading , were bunched as closely as piglets at feeding time , showing the sharpest competition in history . And below the leading St. Louis Cardinals , there was almost as much competition in the National League . One team and one player had especially good sporting value to offer in baseball 's Ersatz Epoch : <P> The team : there was more space ( 10 games ) between the St. Louis Cardinals and the runner-up Pittsburgh Pirates than there was between top and cellar positions in the American League ( 9 games ) . Largely because they had been able to keep most of last season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to prewar standards . <P> The player : Mel Ott , the New York Giants ' right-fielding manager , scored his 1,741st big league run on June 21 , breaking the great Honus Wagner 's alltime record , hung up in 1917 . Ott also holds National League records in home runs ( 483 ) , runs batted in ( 1,749 ) , extra base hits ( 1,013 ) . At a time when most veterans begin to relax , 35-year-old Ott was last week leading both leagues in home runs for the season ( 20 ) . <P> Pennant Prospects . Only some fantastic losing streak could now keep the Cardinals from the pennant . <P> The American League champion is still anybody 's guess , but many a fan favors the leading Browns , who have never yet won a pennant . To succeed , Manager Luke Sewell 's hopefuls must hold their slim lead not only against the strongly bidding New York Yankees ( who became even stronger this week with Veteran Frank Crosetti 's return from a West Coast war job ) , but also every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
