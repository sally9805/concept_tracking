All this gives Mr. Lewis more room in which to maneuver free of presidential boards whose facts have a way of binding the parties tight ' =once public opinion begins leavening . Mr. Lewis not only needed coal , he needed time . General Winter is an ally of the miners  --  subject to judiciously humane restraints . Coal talks progress fastest when everybody 's teeth are chattering . What next ?

They dug coal . Some miners say they do n't like the idea of going back to work until the contract issue is settled . But , as always , they 're following Mr. Lewis ' orders . Why Go Back ? " Why go back for just three weeks ? " was the general reaction among a sober-faced group of miners at Bridgeville , Pa. , when they learned of Mr. Lewis ' dramatic move .
