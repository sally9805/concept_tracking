PAliT FOUR Algiers . Monday . February 15. 19.13 . Ike is at the Advanced Command Post at Constantine . Just talked with him on the phone , and because of a more-than-ordinary clash of armor in the American sector , he is standing by where battle news is most quickly available . On Thursday , Maj. Tex Lee , Ike 's Army aide , phoned me from the office to say a British naval captain had called to offer congratulations on Ike becoming a full general . Had heard a British Broadcasting Company announcement . So , when Ike walked in as I was replacing the receiver , I offered him my hand and said , " Congratulations ! " " What for ? " he asked , not putting out his hand . " On being a full general . " " How do you know ? " As I told him , he stuck out his hand , but almost simultaneously burst out , " I 'm made a full general , the tops of my profession , and I 'm not told officially . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say you heard it ? " Then the phone rang . It was the Message Center with a quick teletype from Mamie Eisenhower , " Congratulations on your fourth star . " General Ike called into the living room Mickey , his personal orderly , and the house boys  --  Hunt , the cook ; Mooney , the houseboy and " handy Andy " ; and Henry Clay Williams and Watson , waiters . On the spot he promoted them each one grade . Turning to me he said , " And you can get yourself an aide of your own . " The new four-star general drove off early next morning for the front . We took a lacing on the central front last night . One of the combat teams is calling for replacements of 50 Sherman tanks . Ike was worried at breakfast this morning , according to one of the party who just drove in from the Advanced CP . But in a phone call this afternoon he was much more cheerful ; the news from the fighting had turned better . Learned that the attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded through outflanking operations  --  supported by 90 to 130 tanks  --  in breaking onto the plain west of the ridge . During that day there was confused fighting west of Faid and east of Sbeitla . We evacuated Gafsa last evening and the American 2nd Corps is taking up position in defense of the FerianaSbeitla line . There is concern that any further contraction of this line will lose us Thelepte airfields , of great importance to current and future operations . The rush to grab Tunisia for practically nothing resulted in splitting up divisions and other units into small outfits . And , as I know from meetings I have attended with Ike and General Anderson , they were working hard to regroup these units to re-establish divisional organizations both among U.S. and British formations . This had not been accomplished when the French , owing to their outmoded and scanty equipment , began to deteriorate under German tank attacks in the central mountainous area . Obviously , Rommel has struck out to make elbowroom for his forces , the better to fight off the Brit ish 8th Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wednesday . February 17 , 19.13 . We have taken a severe licking in the battle for Sidi bou Zid in Central Tunisia . Ike fears we may have lost 4000 or 5000 men and considerable equipment . Com , Fourth star and first victory . Tunisia showed that the Allies would fight and win  --  if properly led . Ike returned by car from the Advanced Command Post last evening about seven , came directly to the office , and started conferring with the Deputy Chief of Staff , British Brigadier Jock Whiteley . ( Gen. Beetle Smith , the Chief of Staff , was at Tripoli . ) Ike had n't eaten since breakfast , was tired after the 8-hour trip , but insisted on starting help frontward before eating his supper . In the midst of these military worries , the Giraud troubles come back in his lap . According to a report from the Liaison Mission , Giraud is upset because , when the Americans evacuated Gafsa , a bridge was blown that prevented the French from taking a large quantity of railway rolling stock from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that area , now that we have retreated from Gafsa . Then Giraud also has had news from Washington  --  less equipment will be available for his troops than he had counted on . Algiers . Thursday . February 18,19.13 . General Alexander arrived late yesterday from Tripoli , to take over active command of this front . He talked with Ike at breakfast . Ike told him he could write his own orders at the front and that he was proud to have Alex serve under him . General Alex said that this was an American sphere ; he fully recognized it was not only necessary but a privilege to come under the American C in C. Alex ventured the firm opinion that the Hun in the present drive was headed for Tebessa . Ike told him General Anderson had been influenced not to send reserves to Fredendall because of interpretation of our intercepts of enemy radio messages that this was to be merely a diversionary move , and that the real one was coming farther north . This interpretation later proved to be wrong . Algiers . Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bou Zid has become stabilized , with the American line now running southwest instead of north and south . We have lost some 112 medium tanks and much other equipment . The casualties will run from 1500 to 2000 . The defeat has made all hands realize the toughness of the enemy and the need of battle experience of our own troops . The loss of the airfields at Thelepte is especially hard to take . This morning Ike had a press conference in which he discussed the military situation at the front entirely off the record , permitting only mention that General Alexander had reported to him and had gone to the front to take charge . To the newsmen , Ike assumed full responsibility for the defeat . Canidantine . Tuesday . February 23 , 1913 . Failure to hold Kasserine Pass resulted from improper placement of two battalions of infantry , one on each side of the two-mile cut through the mountains , according to an officer at Advanced CP , who had visited the gap soon after dispositions had been made . They were placed too far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got above them . The news this morning indicates we did not lose more ground yesterday . Indications of stiffer resistance by the Americans are about the only encouragement to date . We were at General Smith 's house Sunday evening , having dinner , when Beetle answered the phone , found that General Alexander wanted to see Ike by noon Monday at Constantine . Ike immediately said he 'd be there . I checked flying conditions , found nothing could be assured to move before noon , so we arranged to drive . Left Algiers during an air raid at 4:20 A.M. , reaching Constantine at 1:00 P.M. Algiers . Sunday . February 28 , 1913 . The withdrawal of Rommel 's forces through Kasserine Pass and their pursuit by the Allies on the pain have led to resumption of confidence here at eado-ta:ters . Yesterday , Rommel and/or Von Arnim la practically simultaneous attacks at five points along the north and central fronts . This was judged by General Alexander to prevent further reinforcements to the Allied forces , following Rommel 's retreat out of the Kasserine Gap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convoy of fifteen cargo ships , starting March 19 , with the estimated time of arrival April 11 . Ike flew to Constantine yesterday morning and conferred with General Alexander for an hour . Principal purpose was to determine where and how Alexander plans to regroup American units . When he returned yesterday , I asked him how the situation was at the front . His answer was " fair . " Algiers- Sunday , Mareh 7. 11113 . Ike decided Thursday to place the tank expert , General Patton , in command of the 2nd Corps , relieving General Fredendall , so that his ability in training troops , especially after his recent battle experience , might be employed at home . General Patton had been assigned the task of planning and leading the amphibious operation against Sicily . Ike and Patton met Friday afternoon at Maison Blanche , Ike flying in from the east and Patton from the west . Ike gave Patton certain specific instructions . Insisted that there be created in our Army a feeling of partnership between ourselves and the British . Patton 's corps will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Alexander . Patton 's first big task will be to assist the British 8th Army get through the Mareth Line . His force is to tie up as much German strength as possible and secure Gafsa as a forward supply base for Montgomery 's army . General Omar N. Bradley has been made Ike 's deputy to serve as his eyes and ears at the front . Ike and Patton conferred standing up for half an hour at the airfield . Patton , who normally hates the Hun , is all the more embittered because his son-in-law is reported missing in action  --  damned the Germans so violently and emotionally that tears came to his eyes three times during the conference . Today the weather permitted Ike to make a quick flight to see Alexander at Constantine . I accompanied him . His job was to emphasize to General Alexander the need of the British respecting Americans and of preventing loose critical talk . Incidentally , it is now " Ike " and " Alex . " While policing loose tongues and guiding the Tunisian campaign , Ike is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planners to throw away the book and follow the Tunisian campaign with a quick grab of Sicily . Shortage of landing craft may make such a bold and daring follow-up impossible . Ike says when he is buried his coffin should be in the shape of a landing craft , as they are practically killing him with worry . Ike has decided to send me home for a brief trip . I am to see and hear how the home front feels and try to get an American company to install a commercial short-wave radio transmitter in Algiers to operate to the U.S. The press is unhappy with the free service it is getting from the Signal Corps , which feels unnecessarily burdened by the continuous flow of nonmilitary traffic . Algiers .. Thursday , April 8 , 1913 . I left in a C-54 from Maison Blanche Tuesday morning , March ninth , and arrived in Washington on the seventeenth , after a leisurely trip via Marrakech , Dakar , Natal and Puerto Rico . On my first visit to the War Department , I found that the Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially interested in Ike 's welfare . He wanted to know whether the provisions for horseback riding had been made and , if so , whether " Eisenhower " was finding time to ride . He had one principal message to be delivered to " Eisenhower " ? in which the General persists . The Chief of Staff wanted Ike reminded again not to worry about any of the political machinations and not to waste effort in defending any of his past actions . He should not get into any arguments or debates with the visiting firemen who take his time . The General said that Ike 's rise or fall depended on the outcome of the Tunisian battle . If Rommel &; Co. are tossed into the sea , all quibbling , political or otherwise , will be lost in the shouting of the major victory . I visited Ike 's son , John , at West Point and found him healthy and happy . Steve Early arranged for me to see the President for ten minutes . The President kept talking for twenty-five more minutes , so I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know how things were going and was inquisitive about commanders at the front , the retreat of the Americans naturally being in his mind . The President also wanted to know the circumstances that caused our G-2 to predict that the main thrust of the Germans would come through the Ousseltia Pass rather than at Sidi bou Zid . The principal message the President asked me to convey  --  and he spoke repeatedly of the General as " Ike " ? was : " Tell Ike that not only I but the whole country is proud of the job he has done . We have every confidence in his success . " Reached Algiers after five days and one night of flying . I had 664 pounds of baggage , with packages and mail from practically all of the war widows in Washington who knew I was returning . I even had a wife for Telek , purchased in Washington . General Ike brought Telek to meet " Caacie " at the field . It was love at first sight between the two Scotties . Algiers . Saturday . April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good news that ad-vanced elements of the 8th Army had moved into Sfax and that warships of the Royal Navy had gone into the Sfax harbor last night . Alexander plans that two of Patton 's four divisions are now to be brought quietly to the far north of the front along the sea , to prepare for the assault on Bizerte . Our forces are on the offensive all along the line . Algiers . Sta ' tardily . April 17. 1943 . Ike and I returned from the front Thursday afternoon , April 15 , where he conferred ( Continued on Pogo 50 ) // ( Continued from Page 47 ) intend to stay Austrian . I have no intention of becoming a naturalized Swede or American , for that matter . " " Did you ever come in personal contact with any of the big war criminals now about to be tried at Nuremberg ? " I inquired . " No , happily I did not run across any of them during my stay in Germany , but I saw enough of their rule , particularly of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit that I personally was not bothered in any manner during the time I lived in MY THREE YEARS WITH EISENHOWER ( Continued from Page 27 ) with Generals Alexander , Anderson , Toohey Spaatz , Patton , 2nd Corps commander ; Terry Allen , let Division ; Manton Eddy , 9th Division ; Charles W. Ryder , 34th Division . Also Omar Bradley , who was to relieve Patton . Mindful of American public opinion  --  an opinion undoubtedly built up from wishful thinking that the Americans under Patton should have pushed through to the sea and cut off Rommel as he was retreating in front of the 8th Army  --  Ike insisted that General Alexander give the Americans their own sector in the forthcoming  --  and , we hope , final  --  phase of the Tunisian battle . Ike explained the home front in America to Alexander . Ike emphasized the danger to Britain and America if Americans were given to feel that they had not taken an effective part in the Tunisian campaign . If the Americans feel we have not played a substantial part , they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan and commensurately less interested in the grand strategy of beating Hitler first and Japan second . Alexander was quick to realize this possibility . In relieving General Patton , Ike made it clear that old " Blood and Guts " had " done his stuff " ? that his relief should not be regarded by him , his corps or the public as indicative of failure . The 2nd Corps had not only carried out its various missions assigned it by General Alexander , but in the El Guettar sector , Patton 's forces had broken through and had reached a point twenty miles beyond the line which was their objective . Unfortunately , the public was not aware that Patton had such a limited objective  --  one that was dictated by Montgomery 's need to have a clear path for the 8th Army after it had broken through the Mareth Line and the Wadi Akarrit . Patton also had to secure Gafsa as a supply base for Montgomery . Armchair strategists had looked at the map and determined that Patton should push to the sea to cut off Rommel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easter Sunday ) . Ike 's position just now is something like that of a hen setting on a hatch of eggs . He is waiting for the eggs to hatch and is wondering if they will ever break the shell . He has the equivalent of some thirteen divisions pounding at the Axis ' strongly dug-in positions . He is shooting the wad . If they ca n't break through , then be may be on his way home , defeated . I have suggested that Tahiti would be the logical assignment for him in this event , but he 's afraid it will be too good . January 5,1946 Nazi Germany . I was considered too valuable to annoy . I suppose they listed me as an ' honorary Aryan . ' " The little lady looked out the window , pointing to the grounds below and to the ivy-covered walls of the surrounding three-story brick buildings that make up the Nobel Institute city . Her eyes dwelt on the gardens surrounded by apple trees . " Whenever I am tired I look at this , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my own in which I seek refuge now and then . I hope that nothing will happen to upset this world of mine . " THE END Algiers , Friday , April 30 , 1943- Returned this forenoon by Flying Fortress from Constantine , where we stayed overnight , following an interesting visit at the front . Ike saw General Bradley and jeeped to where we had a good view of Hill 609 , the most formidable obstacle confronting the 34th Division . While we watched artillery shell 609 , which it had been doing for four days , infantry was steadily advancing toward this slope . If Hill 609 is taken , which it may he today , we will then be in a position to pass part of the 1st Armored Division onto the coastal plain , where it can be effective . British armor is Likewise waiting farther south for infantry to " open the gate . " On Tuesday , April 27 , we drove to Constantine . Our departure from Algiers was delayed because overnight messages had come into AFHQ indicating desire for a meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshal Tedder to be held in Algiers on Tuesday . The reason for the meeting was a dispute among Montgomery , Cwiningham and Tedder . The latter two were in agreement as to the plan for HUSKY , but " Monty " was n't satisfied . Essence of his objections was that his part in HUSKY had to be so strong his risk of defeat would be nil . Tedder and Cunningham want to take airfields first for air cover . " Monty " wants them left for attack about D-plus-3 or D-plus-4 . Ike will have to referee the interservice British scrap . The air officers live in close comradeship in Constantine . Air Marshal Robb and his associates mess with Spaatz and his gang . They play exciting games of darts for ten francs . But when the Americans get together in a poker game , the British fade away , and I do n't blame them , because the stakes are high . Algiers. , Saturday , May 1 , 1543-Beetle Smith phoned The at the Villa last night before dinner . From Ike 's end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interceptions of low-grade ciphers used at the front , we had discovered that some German units were calling frantically for ammunition . From other sources it was learned that three ships loaded with ammunition were en route to fill the urgent demand . The three ships are at the bottom of the sea , thanks to the Navy . Beetle also reported that of two enemy destroyers bound for Tunisia with some 1600 replacements on each , one had been sunk and the other was burning . Ike received a message from General Marshall this morning questioning the timing of HUSKY operation , insisting it should come off as soon as possible . Ike is pondering an answer while sitting alone at the house this afternoon , waiting my return . We will go to the farm to ride or to play tennis , Altflora . Wednenday . May 3. 11143 ? News that we had finally dislodged the Hun from 609 was followed by capture of Mateur , marking an advance of some fifteen miles . There are now 14 Allied divisions at the front , five Amer ican  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve and such seasoning as the remaining days of the campaign will afford . Possibly it will relieve our 1st Infantry Division , a " crackerjack " outfit . Prime Minister Churchill is always cheering . He 's a joy . Today he sent a cable of congratulations to General Alexander for the British let Army , hoping thus to balance the glory earned by the British 8th Army , which already has won so much praise . Algiers . Saturday . May 11. 1114:1- On Friday , I accompanied Ike on a flying visit to HQ , 2nd Corps , and from there to divisional command posts of the 34th and 1st . General Bradley explained the military situation in his sector from the maps in his tent in the dim light . Ike was enthusiastic over the progress of 2nd Corps , whose 9th Division , and the Corps D'Afrique were pinching Ferryville from south and north , and threatening Bizerte  --  the most important naval base for our use in the Mediterranean . Ernie Pyle had called on Ike some time ago . Ike had told him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and discover Bradley . " Pyle had written almost exclusively of soldiers and junior officers , not caring much for brass . He really discovered Bradley , though , and when the lid was off , five or six columns were devoted to him . Back in Algiers , I heard then from Tex Lee during dinner the news that American forces had taken Bizerte and the British Tunis . The 9th Division had spurted to the goal . Surprisingly , there was no jubilation . Ike said he was n't interested in the capture of mere geographical locations  --  he would be satisfied only when all the Axis forces were cleared from Africa . What he feared now was a long-drawn-out affair in the Cape Bon peninsula . He hoped Alexander would keep the enemy upset and on the run . He especially wanted the atipe Bon peninsula cut from Tunis southward . There still was fighting on the 8th Army front in the Enfidaville area . Another message came in , Baying that a German wireless message had been intercepted . It contained the " good-bye " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another intercept indicated a plan to evacuate 33,000 Germans and 30,000 Italians . This would leave a job for our Navy and Air , which are patrolling the sea . Someone , in another message , had recalled Churchill 's statement at the time of the threatened invasion of Britain . He had said , " We are ready ; so are the fishes . " Akciers . Monday . May 10. 1111:1 . Bill Stoneman wrote for the Chicago Daily News : " We came into North Africa on a shoestring when we waded ashore at Algiers six months ago tonight . We entered Tunis on the tail of an avalanche . " If he had mentioned Bizerte , it would have been complete , but the proper thought is expressed . /ke 's thoughts are on the next job against Hitler  --  Sicily . We do n't seem to think much about the Eyeties any more , although I heard up front that artillery units are fighting well when in dug-in positions . Bradley told the story in the north , in a brief message I took on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mission completed . " Congratulatory messages are flowing in like returns from a global election . Among them are warm tributes from President Roosevelt and His Majesty the King . This morning Ike is dictating answers . He just asked me to read his drafts of replies to General Marshall and Secretary Stimson . I thought they were perfect . " I 've got to cable the King , " he said , so he buzzed for Warrant Officer Marshall , his prize stenographer . I suggested he start it , " Dear kingy . " " Or Dear Georgie , ' " Ike said . WO Marshall ventured , " ' Dear Rex . ' " Ike had hoped to review fully with Beetle his ideas for conduct of the war for the next . six or nine months , so his Chief of Staff could reflect them to the Combined Chiefs ' meeting in Washington . Ike got this done between other jobs , but . at the moment I am not clear just what he has recommended . If he had been sure the Tunisian affair would disintegrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip himself . .111/11erx . VI'rdneralay . : ? Itty 12. 191:1 . Ike intends to take Pantelleria before Sicily . HOBGOBLIN is the code name for Pantelleria , but the operation itself is called CORKSCREW . Pantelleria has a valuable airfield , a thorn in our side if held by the enemy , but if we get it we can supply some air cover for landings in Sicily . Yesterday , I accompanied Ike on a flying visit to 18th Army Group HQ near Le Kef , where Ike conferred with General Alexander in his camouflaged tent . In the north , in 2nd Corps sector , the Americans had counted some 20,000 prisoners . In the Cape Bon sector , the British 7th Armored Division bad cut the neck of the peninsula . Consequently , Ike 's worry that a quick vies tory would be frustrated by another " Bataan " on the peninsula was unnecessary . Just now Ike is fretting that the scarcity of landing craft has prevented him attacking Sicily while the enemy is disorganized in Tunisia . But despite all his attempts to attain an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ike is taking some justifiable pride in his prediction , made first in a letter to General Marshall under date of March 29 , that he " guessed " the Tunisian campaign would be finished by May 15 . Alexander yesterday reminded him of this prediction and complimented him on it  --  recalling that his own guess had been June 15 . Alexander promised to have the pocket cleared by the fifteenth to make Ike 's forecast come precisely true . That would be Saturday . Algiers . Thursday . May 13. 191:1 . News of Von Arnim 's capture came while we were at dinner last night . The whole show is over in Tunisia , except for sporadic opposition . Von Arnim and the other German generals are being flown promptly to England for expert examination , and then will be sent to America . General Ike is sending our G-2 to interview Von Arnim when the C-97 bearing him stops at Maison Blanche . Ike refuses to see Von Arnim ; his hatred of the Germans , and particularly of the Nazi ideology , being so strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative of the Nazi regime . Although last night we celebrated mildly Von Arnim 's capture and the conclusion of hostilities , Ike has not been what I would call jubilant over the result , he having satisfied himself victory would come by May 15 ? a confidence that grew after the British took Tripoli and he found the port could pass 3000 tons a day of supplies . A correspondent at the press conference this morning asked what he regarded as the most critical period of the campaign . Ike said , " From Christmas through January . " Ike 's disposition does n't permit relaxation . He scarcely ever has a feeling of self-satisfaction . He discounts current accomplishment because his mind is racing ahead to the next campaign . Thinking ahead to Pantelleria and Sicily , the Tunisian victory has left him cold . He is convinced that if he could undertake the Sicilian operation immediately with only two divisions , he could gain a bridgehead and an advantage that would make the further conquest of the island a simple affair . He suffered almost physically during January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positions in Tunisia . Now he resents every day we give the Hun and Eyetie to strengthen Pantelleria and Sicily . Ike has developed a habit of waking about 4:00 or 4:30 and , as he finds himself sufficiently rested , his mind begins wrestling with his problems . Sometimes he manages to put himself back to sleep , but rarely . He is hopeful that our efforts to capture Pantelleria may be a test of the effect of concentrated heavy bombing . He expects to concentrate our maximum air power on the island , to see whether damage to materiel , personnel and morale can be made so serious as to make 1 he amphibious landing inexpensive in lives . A message from Alexander 's headquarters says , " War in Africa should finish tonight . " That was last night . A1111 .. rra . Monday . May 2 I. 19 1:t . In our headquarters , I am noticing officers definitely showing signs of continuing strain ; they are planners who make plans for almost any eventuality or attack . Many are at work on HUSKY , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is constantly appalled jy the number of staff officers required'to run this sprawling theater . He thinks we should use more Waacs , as he is finding it almost impossible to find enough satisfactory clerks or stenographers among the enlisted men . In off moments , the Allied Commander is growling about his military education . None of the military schools , including Leavenworth , ever gave him a hint of what a headache would come out of a quarter million prisoners of war , especially when transportation facilities are clogged . . ugh-TN . Timpdhly . May 25. 191:1 . Things of current interest are : 1 . French unity . Giraud has sent another message by General Catroux to General de Gaulle in London . It emphasizes establishment of collective control for the trusteeship of French interests until the war is over , and free choice by the French of their permanent government . 2 . The attacks on Italian islands are being planned and activated . In the next month there will be three . An operation to take Pantelleria Island has received Ike 's approval over fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very tough nut . The next operation will he to take Lampedusa , to be followed by Sicily . Beetle is returning from Washington sessions of the Combined Chiefs . He will reach Casablanca only shortly before the arrival of a " diatinguiehed person " known as the " Air Commodore , " whose forthcoming visit to Algiers has disrupted Ike 's plan of spending the week in a eemiholiday visiting General Clark and inspecting the 5th Army and units at Oujda , Oran and Casablanca . Algiers . Thuroulay . May 27. 1913 . Met Beetle and party at Casablanca Tuesday evening . Beetle reports that throughout the Combined Chiefs ' sessions , there had been earnest discussion between the two great Allies . Differences were evident . The British have now won a big victory and their national pride again is showing itself . Our Americans have been subjected to public and political pressure to engage more heavily against the Jape and , apparently , have been showing their teeth to the British . Plans approved in Washington call for operations in North Africa to continue as already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock Italy out of the war as quickly as possible . Beetle explained there had been again discussion with the British on the question of striking directly into Germany 's heart by invading from England across the Channel . The Americans still want this , but the British remain to be convinced it can be done . This question was settled by agreement on an attack to be launched against the continent by May 1 , 1944 , with the possibility that Ike would be the Allied Commander in Chief . The President is fearful of the result of an attack on the Continent and seems somewhat shaken by events at home . The President feared defeat unless the attack is gigantic . Beetle said another meeting of the Combined Chiefs will be held after HUSKY is completed , probably in July or August . Beetle felt most strongly that Ike should attend . The meeting probably will be in Washington . Algiers . Saturday . May 29. 111.1:1 . Churchill , General Marshall , General Sir Alan Brooke , Gen. Sir Hastings Ismay and entourage , arrived at Mai-son Blanche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ride from the.airdrome to the two adjoining villas with Admiral Cunningham . Ike planned to bring General Marshall . However , the P.M. wanted to ride with Ike . Consequently , the Admiral accompanied General Marshall and I rode in the front seat . The General said his trip had been ordered by the President so unexpectedly that he and his aide , Lt. Col. Frank McCarthy , had only a few hours to prepare . Although Ike had the Prime Minister driven to the Admiral 's house , the P.M. did n't even stop there to rest . He immediately trundled with Ike down the driveway to our house . There , with General Marshall and the Admiral , they gathered on the front porch , the Prime Minister finding a comfortable chair and seemed settled for the duration . " Henry Clay " brought glasses , ice and necessary refreshment material . An informal conference , pleasant to kibitz upon , continued until time to get ready for dinner . General Marshall is accompanying the Prime Minister this far at Churchill 's request to the President , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pursue the campaign in the Mediterranean area until the Italians are out of the war . Presumably he then wants the Allied effort to continue in the Mediterranean area rather than across the Channel , as already agreed by the . Combined Chiefs ( Continued on Page .5J ) 54 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 5 , 1946 ( Conlinoed from Page 52 ) at their Washington meeting . He makes no bones of his point of view , and apparently regards the decision already taken as quite open to review and change . The Prime Minister had told the President he felt it only fair for General Marshall , as the representative of the American point of view to the contrary , to be present . Churchill recited his story three different times in three different ways last night . He talks persistently until he has worn down the last shred of opposition . Ike is glad to have General Marshall on hand . A meeting in our dining room is " laid on " for fourteen , starting at 5:00 this afternoon . Algiers , Sunday , May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel McCarthy flying in Ike 's B-17 to our advanced camp between Tunis and Bizerte . Ike and I had a free afternoon and evening , so we went to the farm and played some tennis . Before dinner , I received a call from Commander Thompson inquiring if the General could see the Prime Minister at our house at 10:45 that night . We returned to the villa in town in time for Churchill 's late visit . Ike and I sat reminiscing while waiting for the Prime Minister . Ike was growling because of the necessity of spending another night , probably until 1:30 , going over the same ground  --  that is , " Keep on until you get Italy , " which Churchill had already covered and re-covered . " Would you ever have thought a year ago or , certainly , two years ago , that you would be in far-off Africa , the Allied Commander of a great and victorious army , sitting in a villa waiting a late night call from the Prime Minister of His Majesty 's government and growling because the P.M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought both of us back to proper perspective and Ike enjoyed the picture upon which he elaborated , going back to his boyhood days when he had been variously a cowboy , a boiler stoker in a creamery and a semipro ballplayer . The Prime Minister arrived alone , and soon was engaged in a " repeat " of various factors relating to the prospective collapse of Italy and the necessity , in his view , of vigorous prosecution of our campaign after we have taken Sicily . He said be felt it proper for him to talk directly and alone to Ike because , after all , Ike was the Allied Commander under the Combined Chiefs which represent two great Allies , of which Britain was one . Consequently , he felt he was not taking an improper advantage to press his point of view with Ike . Ike assured him that he saw nothing improper whatsoever . Churchill is so persistent in his desire to knock out Italy that he said the British would be proud to halve their already short rations for a month if the shipping thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conquest of Italy . He said he confidently looked forward to having Christmas dinner with Ike in Rome . Ike pointed out that his opportunity for exploitation was somewhat limited by the string the Chief of Staff had placed on seven divisions required to be available for return to the U.K. from November 1 onward . If the Italians fought stubbornly in Sicily , as they have done when they were in good defensive positions in Tunisia , then we would be confronted with a long campaign , fighting for each hilltop . It was simply too early , he emphasized , to make a firm commitment . I have used a variety of schemes to hustle visitors away at night . On occasions , I have yawned openly and loudly . On others , I have paraded in my bathrobe before the lingering guest or guests . Neither of these seemed appropriate for this occasion , so I found my flashlight and walked in front of the door . This was at 1:00 o'clock . Mr. Churchill left at 1:10 , trudging up the driveway to the Admiral 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found , had waited outside our front door . Algiers . Monday , May 31 , 10.13 . Churchill came to our house for dinner tonight . Ike and General Marshall were co-hosts . Among the " also-rans " were the British Foreign Minister , Mr. Anthony Eden , who sat on Ike 's left , the Prime Minister , of course , being on his right . On General Marshall 's right was the CIGS , General Brooke , with General Ismay on his left . The question of diaries came up . The Prime Minister said it was foolish to keep a day-by-day diary because it would simply reflect the change of opinion or decision of the writer , which , when and if published , makes one appear indecisive and foolish . He cited the diary of a British general who had written one day : " There will be no war . " On the next day war was declared . He said he would much prefer to wait until the war is over and then to write impressions , so that , if necessary , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have an important part in the attempt to take Pantelleria has raised grave questions as to the success of the operation  --  thinks casualties will be awful . Ike does n't think so and has made the " command decision " to carry on . Algiers , Tuesday , Juno . 1913 . Admiral Cunningham has invited Ike to accompany him on a destroyer or a cruiser during the bombardment of Pantelleria , set for June 8 . The Prime Minister also wants to get in this show , and may cast all discretion to the wind to take part in it . It now seems that Ike will not worry about the Islands of Lampedusa , Linoea and Pelage , figuring they will follow if we take Pantelleria , as they will be virtually cut off from Italy . Caacie is going to be a mother soon . I have bet Ike there will be four pups , and will pay him $1 for each less than four , dead or alive . He will pay me $1 for each more than four . Algiers . Friday . Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister was held at 5:00 yesterday afternoon at our house . Present on the American side were Generals Marshall , Eisenhower , Major Generals T. T. Handy and W. B. Smith ( Beetle ) and Brig . Gen. Lowell Rooks . On the British : the Prime Minister , Eden , Cunningham , Brooke , Tedder , Montgomery , Ismay , Sugden and Dick . These meetings were for clarification of the decisions taken by the Combined Chiefs of Staff at the so-called " Trident " meetings in Washington in so far as they affected our operations , particularly ROUNDHAMMER , the current name for the cross-Channel operation to be undertaken by May 1 , 1944 . Bombing of the railway yards on the outskirts of Rome was agreed as essential in the air campaign to break up Italian transportation . In closing , Churchill said that he had been most solidly encouraged and he would take home a feeling of confidence and comradeship which characterized actions in this theater . Mickey , who sees and knows all at Admiral Cunningham 's household because of his close friendship with the ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Page 5.4 ) staff there , reported during the week that the Prime Minister 's breakfast one morning consisted of one bottle of white wine , one bottle of soda water and one dish of ice . Meer 's . NIundny , June 7. 1043 . Caacie had her pups today . She chose their birthplace under a bed in one of the servant-guest rooms . There were three in the litter , and the largest , coal black , died . The remaining boy and girl seem O.K. After Ike and I had visited Caacie and looked at her new family , I phoned Major Lee at the office . Always seeking to be helpful on any occasion , when I told him the big news , he said , " Anything I can do ? " AlstIeritt- Wednesday , June 9 , 1913 . A four-star General and a full Admiral yesterday used themselves as " bait " to draw enemy fire . Tuesday afternoon at six , Ike , Admiral Cunningham , Commodore Dick , Commander Henderson , a naval gunnery officer , Flag Lieutenant Dampier and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where we were quickly whisked to HMS Aurora , which was to take the party to bombarded Pantelleria . Slipping from Bone harbor at 1:00 A.M. , we glided quietly at twenty-eight knots toward our objective , picking up a lone destroyer escort , the Troubridge . We reached Pantelleria promptly on schedule , at 10:30 the next morning . The Air Force would make some 600 sorties on the island fortress during the day . In between their bombings , the cruisers would let go with their 6-inch guns . Under this fire the destroyers would creep to within 2500 yards of the shore and bang away . The first objective , however , was to determine the location and number of shore batteries having a range of well above 20,000 yards . Our cruiser and its escort reached within 7000 yards of shore batteries while we could still see the other four cruisers and eight destroyers coming up . The shore batteries were silent . The A-20 's had already been in . Dust and smoke drifted toward us , covering our target , which was the dock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the escarpment , probably in solid rock and concrete . Then the Lightnings came , and their dive bombing was thrilling to see . They dropped their belly tanks before diving . Shortly after 11:00 , each cruiser with its two destroyer escorts approached the targets on separate courses . When we opened with a broadside of our 6-inch guns , the ship quivered . We shot first at the mole , which could be recognized because through the dust and smoke we could see a high crane . Then our fire was directed to the right of the crane some 200 or 300 yards , where the docks were located . After our bombardment had been under way for fifteen minutes , one of the lookouts called that a flag was being run up in the signal tower on the island . It was difficult to make out the meaning of the signal through the smoke and haze . Had we been so fortunate as to be on hand for a surrender ? We waited expectantly , wondering if the signal flag would be white . Finally the answer came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As the cruisers were finishing their salvos , the destroyers slid within 2000 yards of the shore . By then , two shore batteries were working fitfully , some thirty shells having been seen to burst in the water . So far as we know , there were no hits on the bombarding vessels . The shore batteries seemed to bother the destroyers . So , after letting go their 4-inchers at close range , they spread heavy smoke screens and sped away to join the now-departing cruisers . While the destroyers had been in close , three MTB 's dashed toward the mole at full speed . When they came within perhaps a half mile of the mole , they turned suddenly away , leaving smoke bombs on the water . They had encountered light fire from machine guns and perhaps 20 mm . En route home , the results were appraised . Admiral Cunningham found it obvious that the fire-control mechanism of the shore batteries was not working , as the firing of the two active batteries was inaccurate . He felt we could have taken the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infantry . Ike felt that with the bombing to be sustained until Friday , June 1.1 , the morale of the defenders would be so cracked that we should have no difficulty in taking the island . Alaraera , Friday , June 11.11113 . Today was D Day for the assault landing on Pantelleria , with H Hour at 12 noon . Shortly after 12:00 o'clock , word was received here by Ike through Admiral Cunningham : " Pantelleria surrenders ; says account lack of water . " Eleven thousand Italians on the island had been pounded into submission and gave up when they saw the formidable armada of cruisers , destroyers , MTB 's and landing craft carrying infantry approaching the island . Ike is elated . For the past few days he has been going through the same type of jitters which marked the days immediately preceding our landings in North Africa . He slept fitfully last night . This morning at breakfast , he said he could n't wait for H Hour . But wait be did , and good news it was . Ike has decided the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Marshal Tedder , the air attacks " laid on " for Pantelleria were switched to Lampedusa . Bombs dropped there within an hour and a half after the order was issued by Ike . Algiers , Saturday . June 12. 1913 . " General Lyon , " flew into Maison Blanche today . This has been and still is a whopper of a secret , although a meeting of British brains is in progress this afternoon to determine when announcement of the King 's visit to North Africa should be made . Ike is to have dinner alone with the King tonight and again tomorrow night . But tomorrow the three senior commanders , Cunningham , Tedder and Alexander , as well as Beetle , are to be there too . In order not to attract much attention , the Allied Commander in Chief 's 1 . acarnernade its way to Maison Blanche lo The converted Lancaster bomber circled the field twice , landed and followed a jeep with a yellow flag to its parking place . As the motors died away , the door opened and out stepped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give " General Lyon . " Ike , Cunningham and Tedder saluted and shook hands . Soon King and Ike were stepping briskly to the car where the driver and I waited . As the King was traveling incognito , it was proper for Ike 's car to fly its customary three flags  --  French , American and British  --  and the red plates fore and aft with their four stars uncovered . The King , in fine spirits , confided to Ike that while this was supposedly an official inspection trip for him , it really was a holiday . He said it gets very boring to live virtually in only one room . After three and a half years of war , it felt good to be on a trip where he could get to the beach in the afternoon and be free from the exacting rigors of the King 's business . He asked many questions as to climate , the natives and military operations . On the latter , he apparently had received news aboard the plane of the quick surrender of Pantelieria . More surprising to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearing not to listen , but actually doing a good job of it , he was up-to-date on both military and political situations . He liked Ike 's uniform , asked the kind of material . Ike said it was tropical worsted , which had the advantage of keeping its press longer than the khaki . The King wanted to know how he kept it clean . Ike told him he had it dry-cleaned . Apparently the King was recognized by many soldiers as he drove along , for there were repeated salutes . After we had dropped the King , we agreed we had done our bit without a hitch , with the possible exception of having intruded on the King 's right to answer his own salutes . Ike being only mildly concerned , but fearing the King had never been told the difference between the American and British customs . Ike had a press conference at 3:30 this afternoon at which he took the correspondents into his confidence , trusting them implicitly . Told them the next operation would be against Sicily , " sometime next month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the week , the Combined Chiefs of Staff have sent a directive to Ike authorizing him to bomb the railway yards in Rome near Vatican City . When this bombing starts , there will be loud wails . Presence of the King in our midst was officially announced on Wednesday , June 16 . The announcement included the statement that he had come to North Africa to invest Ike with the Grand Cross of the Most Honorable Order of the Bath  --  makes Ike a " G.C.B. " but not a " Sir . " The ceremony was simple . Shortly after dinner at General Gale 's villa , given by the King on Saturday night , June 12 , the King stepped quietly to another room and returned with the broad maroon ribbon to which was attached the attractive medallion . With the senior commanders looking on as gratified witnesses , the King soberly and with dignity " invested " our Kansas farm boy with the highest military honor within the power of the British government to bestow .
