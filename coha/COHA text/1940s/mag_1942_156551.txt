Excerpts from the diary of an American engineer who salvaged a $500,000 bomber forced down in the jungle near the headwaters of the Amazon : <P> July 28-Left 1:30 p.m. on Beechcraft No. 2 and scouted jungle for three hours . No success . <P> July 31-Located plane in small clearing . <P> Aug. 6-Arrived at Turiassu . Continued to Santa Ana . Arrived 9 p.m . <P> Aug. 7-Stream forks . . . . Left canoes to continue on foot . . . decided to cut trail to try and locate plane . Bearings S. 72 E. . . . Put under observation by native Indians . They actually believe we are crazy for doing this . . . . Jungle night studded with an incredible concentration of stars per square lightyear . A hammock strung between two trees at the edge of the clearing . The hut is quiet . Voices recede and stop . The jungle night takes over . . . a big cat prowls around looking for something to kill . . . . Presently she materializes out of the night . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I take her hand-dawn would reveal a rather bulging hammock with a hastily dropped coffee cup under it . <P> Aug. 12-Four days of sweat , bad food and virgin jungle . A bushmaster bit me in the left index finger-had to shoot the end of the finger off to avoid dying . <P> Aug. 13-It must be luck or the patronizing hand of an angel . Trail broke out under left wing of B-24 bomber . For the scouting planes that are checking on us we wrote a large three dots and one dash for victory and success . <P> Aug. 14-Feel like a gentleman of leisure . Would like a tall , sleek , beautiful brunette to bring me my coffee . . . . Scouted clearing and ran set of levels for a proposed take-off strip . <P> Aug. 15-If women knew how beautiful they look in the semidarkness of a bedroom they would become exclusively night prowlers . The day a woman forgets her vanity and realizes the power of uninhibited surrender , the day of the prowling male is finished and the period of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . <P> Aug. 19-Finger doing fine . Monkey meat is plenty tough but ah ! - the spareribs . Man is a four-dimensional animal because he can project his personality into space by his creative powers . Woman is three-dimensional . <P> Aug. 26-It feels like Saturday . Two thousand five hundred feet of take-off strip cleared . Food delivered by parachute . <P> Sept. 8-Civilization is the great birth-control agent-nature in the raw , a baby every year . <P> Sept. 11-Take-off strip ready . Big day tomorrow . <P> Sept. 12-Bomber take-off successful . Delivered same at Army base .
