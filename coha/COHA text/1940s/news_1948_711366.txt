txt Mayor O'Dwyer , having threatened to supplant Tammany Hall , with a new civic-minded organization , is planning to go beyond that and weld the five separate county organizations into an integrated , ' united - city democracy , it was ' learned yesterday . Sources close to the Mayor said he has long had such an idea in mind and that he feels the present rupture with the dissident , but controlling , faction in Tammany over the nomination for Surrogate has given him an opportunity to carry out his plan . It envisages , it was said , Kings County and its leader , Borough President John Cashmore , in dominant roles . The day 's developments , meanwhile , on the inquiry into reports that three Tammany leaders received $1,000 each to influence their vote for the nomination of General Sessions Judge Francis L. Valente for Surrogate were : The resignation of a third Tammany officeholder , Abraham Rosenthal , from " his$5,450-a-year job gs Assistant Corporation Counsel . Extension of the grand jury investigating the " bribes " until July 9 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor is trying to supplant as leader of the Third Assembly District Middle , assailing " City Hall autocrats " and declaring that " we are not for sale for money or jobs and we will not be pushed around by the Mayor . " In what was viewed as of little political moment except by those cognizant of the Mayor 's plans , Mr. Cashmore met Mr. O'Dyvyer yesterday afternoon in front of City Hall and rode with him to Gracie Mansion . The Mayor , it was recalled , took a stand similar to the one on Tammany in the factional fight for county leader , helping elect Mr. Cashmore over Kenneth F. Sutherland . Not since the days of Richard Croker and Charles F. Murphy has there been a single dominant leader of the city 's democracy , although George W. Olvany and John F. Curry were titular leaders . Should the Mayor 's plan succeed , Brooklyn , which has played second fiddle to Manhattan in the loosely-jointed . Democratic city set-up since its consolidation into the greater city on Jan. 1 , 1898 , would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason why the Democrats should have five separate and distinct political entities in the city without a governing and coordinating " board of directors . " Representation on this board , or executive committee , should be alloted on the basis of actual party voting strength , according to his view , with a chairman to be selected from among the county leaders . He feels that the veto power of the executive committee would effectually restrain the chairman and keep him from becoming a supreme boss in the old sense . Never Claimed Leadership Brooklyn , home borough of the Mayor where he was County Judge and District Attorney , has never asserted its claim to city leadership , it was pointed out , although for several decades it has been first in population and first in Democratic voting strength . With a feudal and badly-split Manhattan organization , its only challenge could come from the Bronx , but it is felt that Edward J. Flynn would willingly go along with the Mayor on a city-wide reorganization . The resignation of Mr. Rosenthal was announced by the Mayor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of part of the Fourth Assembly District on the East Side . Until recently he held the office of chief clerk in the Board of Elections . Carmine G. De Sapio , leader of the ' faction in Tammany opposing the Mayor and Frank J. Sampson , who is leader without control , is a Democratic Commissioner of Elections . Mr. De Sapio , questioned the previous day before the grand jury , stopped at the Criminal Courts Building yesterday and issued a brief denial that any money had been paid to swing the nomination to Judge Valente and deny it to Mr. Sampson 's and the Mayor 's candidate , Council President Vincent R. Impellitteri . " If they ( he did not specify whom he meant ) had called me first , " he said , " I was so close to . the picture I could have alleviated , this entire investigation . If there was any wrongdoing I would know about it . And I know there was no money paid to anyone . " Not so brief nor restrained was Mr. in his defiance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hall would defeat in the primaries . " Mayor O'Dwyer is not the dictator of New York County , " he said . " We still have Democratic primaries and the ballot box . He can not displace me . The Democratic voters in my district elected me by a handsome majority , and I am ready to go to the people at any time to beat him and his political co-partner , Kennedy . Decries " Ill-Mannered Outburst " " The Mayor gave us nothing ; we owe him nothing . My district gave him the biggest vote in the entire city . In return he abuses me and my constituents in an ill-tempered and ill-mannered outburst . " When he teams himself up with Mike Kennedy he adopts and endorses everything corrupt and degraded in the Kennedy regime which blew up in the historic scandal which branded Kennedy forever a political outcast . " The Mayor on Thursday reappointed Martin J. Kennedy , brother of former Tammany Leader Michael J. Kennedy Jr. , as a city marshal . At that time the Mayor said he would recognize " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manus who had supplanted him . Michael Kennedy lost his Tammany leadership . in. 1943 in the ' fight over Thomas A. Aurelio 's candidacy , for Supreme Court judge , an office to which the latter was subsequently elected . Mr. in his statement closed some of the political horse trading that goes on in Tammany and to which , he asserted , the Mayor was a party . " I asked for the job ( of city marshal ) for an officer of my organization , " Mr. related . " Sampson told me that he would do his best to get it for me , but that Mike was moving heaven and earth to hold it , even to going to the Mayor . Weeks dragged on . " One day , long before any Surrogate designation , Sampson called me in and told me that Kennedy had approached him and promised that if I would go along with the Mayor re-appointing Martin Kennedy , Mike Kennedy would close up his club , stop all opposition to me and make it financially worth while to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for anything or any money . In my presence he called up Mike Kennedy , apparently awaiting the call , and told him my decision . Still there was no move by the Mayor . Kennedy meanwhile holding over . " I knew what the score was then and the Mayor gave me the proof yesterday . " Mr. said he felt sorry " for Frank Sampson and his few followers who choose to play rubber stamp for a Mayor operating ' outside his official authority and indeed outside the Penal Law in publicly peddling his favors for support for his hand-picked candidate . " No Complaint Made to Hogan This same charge of violation of the Penal Code by the Mayor was made by another Tammany officeholder who resigned on Wednesday . When it was called to District Attorney Frank Hogan 's attention he said that no complaint had been made to his office . Unofficially it was said that this section of the Penal Code was designed to prevent the dismissal of a city employe under threat of failing to go along with a nomination . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced resignation of an employe after he had voted for a nomination not ' deemed in the public interest , it was said . General Sessions Judge John A. Mullen extended until next Friday the term of the third June grand jury at the request of Assistant District Attorney Alfred S. Scotti . Mr. Hogan at a press conference later said this was not to be construed as indicating anything significant but that it was done merely of complete the appearance of the remaining Tammany leaders before the continuing body . " I would not feel we were doing a complete job if we did not call all the male leaders , " he said . He expects that appearances will be ended after several sessions next week and that he then will make a statement on " any findings We may have . " Yesterday the grand jury heard testimony of fourteen leaders and eleven co-leaders . In its first week of inquiry the grand jury heard fifty-six of the seventy-six leaders and co-leaders , in addition to William F. Donoghue , executive secretary to the Mayor , and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling in Frank Costello , reputed slot machine operator , but that he would ask Judge Valente to testify concerning " reports " which he said he had heard that someone had , paid $2,500 for votes against his nomination . " I am as interested in checking on reported payments for one side as I am for another , " the prosecutor said . Rogers Maintains Silence Manhattan Borough President Hugo E. Rogers remained silent yesterday on the Mayor 's earlier demand that he oust five proValente district leaders employed in his office , one holding a Civil Service position . The Mayor said he had received no word from Mr. Rogers . Former General Sessions Judge Francis X. ' Mancuso , Tammany leader of the Sixteenth Assembly District , who voted for Judge Valente , stopped at City Hall to talk briefly with the Mayor after an appearance at the Criminal Courts Building . " I met him in the hall as I was coming in and he spoke about the general picture just a few minutes , " the Mayor later said . Asked whether Mr. Mancuso 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Tammany fight , the Mayor said , " You can draw your own conclusions . " He denied , however , that the DeSapio faction had come forth with any peace feelers.
