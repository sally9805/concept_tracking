When **31;834;TOOLONG ( DDT ) was first offered to the general public in 1945 , the U.S. Army and Public Health Service warned that the wonder insecticide had better be used cautiously . No one knew much about DDT 's long-range effect on human beings or on the balance of nature . <P> The warnings have often been repeated in technical journals . But the public , delighted with DDT , kept right on spraying closets , beds , kitchens and household pets . Whole communities were engulfed in artificially created DDT fogs . Gardeners and dairy farmers found it a quick means of destroying insect pests . By 1947 , the manufacture of DDT . had boomed into a $30 million industry . <P> Last week , Columnist-Crusader Albert Deutsch of the New York Post raised a hue &; cry against the dangers of DDT , with a series of articles called " DDT and You .

Presence of the chemical in milk would be contrary to the Food , Drug , and Cosmetic Act . "
