Said the Prime Minister : <P> " It has fallen to the hard lot of Britain to play a leading part in the Mediterranean . We have great responsibilities and we have made great exertions there . . . . <P> " We have one principle about liberated countries , or repentant satellite countries , which we strive for according to the best of our ability and resources . Here is the principle . <P> " I will state it in the broadest and most familiar terms : government of the people , by the people and for the people , set up on the basis of free universal suffrage , elections with secrecy of ballot , and no intimidation . <P> " That is , and that always has been , the policy of this Government in all countries . It is not only our aim and in our interest ; it is our only care . It is to that goal that we try to make our way across all difficulties , obstacles and perils of the long road . Trust the people .

We went with the full approval of both our great Allies . We went on invitation of the Greek Government , in which all parties , even Communists , were represented . . . . We came with good gifts in our hands : civility and assistance to all parties of the Greek Government , which was formed and had to face the confusion left by the flight of the Germans . <P> " We brought food , clothing and supplies . We came with a small force of troops . We took up our positions from no military point of view . . . . <P> " We were received with flowers and cheers and every expression of rapture , and we British - wicked British , so denounced by American correspondents . . . and so hounded by some of our own - busied ourselves in distribution of supplies throughout the country to which we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
