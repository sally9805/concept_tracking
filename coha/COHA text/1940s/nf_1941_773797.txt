txt // something to be said for it . These particular two are interesting here as illustrating a couple of different motives for using language . The bow-wow man reacts to , or talks about , a referent or object which is out in the world . The pooh-pooh man reacts to , or expresses , his own feelings . The two of them provide examples of two functions of language which are quite distinct . These are called the referential and the emotive functions . Emotive language expresses the speaker 's feelings , and aims at stirring those of the hearer and perhaps spurring him on to some action . Referential language refers to objects or actions or situations which can be pointed to or described , and makes statements which may be verified or disproved by the other fellow . The difference between the two is the difference between a statement like " The Normandie sails at noon on Wednesday " and an expression like " My soul is a ship in full sail . " Any educational system that gave training in making this distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come later in this chapter , would provide its society with a first-rate umbrella against sales talk and propaganda . Reference has already been made to the dangers of discussing isolated words out of their contexts , and this warning will frequently be repeated . But here the risk is taken . The reader is invited to look at the two lists of words below and to select one word from each group as being an emotive word . A word is used emotively , we remember , when the speaker uses it to reveal his own attitude toward the object about which he is talking . // Here are five nouns : building , factory , home , house , stable . And five adjectives : beautiful , electric , hard , opposite , wet . Which are the two emotive words ? The word " home " has a very strong emotional aroma about it , as the real-estate agent knows . So much so , indeed , that the French have borrowed it ; and so , though the Frenchman 's house , referentially speaking , is la @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( The reader does not need to be told that " beautiful " is the other emotive word . ) A simple experiment might interest some of those who like to examine their own language . Looking over half a dozen pages of writing they have done recently ? notes , letters , reports ? they might class all the words they have used under two headings . The emotive list would consist of the " nice , " " wonderful , " " beauty , " and " goodness " kind of words , and might give the individual a bird's-eye view of his own unconscious methods of self-deception . In the of the referential class , would be found two kinds of words : gadgets like " a , " " the , " " of , " " for , " " to , " which are handy devices for tying words together into 2coherence ; and words which seem to have some " content , " tent , " some " meaning , " of their own . These last are a selection from one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looked at , and taken apart . Everybody has a unique collection of words that he uses regularly , like an individual set of tools . They are fairly constant ; and it is not nearly as important to acquire more of them as it is to use good judgment in choosing them and to // gain a knowledge of all the different ways in which they can be worked . For we all have to arrange our thoughts , and communicate them , by means of these instruments ; and those who study them are rewarded in compound interest for their time and trouble . Incidentally , such study has the result of increasing the vocabulary as well as of making it more efficient . The common words are the ones that need our attention most . We talk glibly about souls before we have paused to get a clear idea of the different kinds of thing we can mean by the word " body . " We are willing to turn our attention to the spirit while we remain weak before the task of diagnosing the behavior of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think with , and to put our thoughts across to our fellows , deserve at least as much attention as the other tools of our various trades . The functions of language must not be left basking in a light of false simplicity . Referential language isW not always used in a referential way . Perhaps we may use as a warning an experience of the late G. K. Chesterton , who , while turning over in his brain schemes of his own , is said to have stopped before the stall of a fishwoman . Fixing her pleasantly with his eye , he began : " You are a noun , a verb , and a preposition . " The woman blushed . Chesterton pitched his voice a note higher and continued firmly : " You are an adverb , an adjective , and a conjunction ; you are a pronoun ? " Pronoun was too much . The fishwoman smacked his face with a flounder and called the police . 1 // The bulk of the words we use were originally used - emotiv y . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song had the same origins . Primitive men used little thought , and much sound and feeling. - . It is possible , with careful definition , to take emotive words and use them referentially . Writers on theories of art try earnestly to be precise in their handling of such a word as " beautiful . " In ordinary conversation , on the , ... : ... other hand , all of us have a habit of fathering nonemotive words and using them very emotively indeed. , We stretch the uses of terms we borrow from psychology ? rationalization , " " complex , " etc. ? or from politics and economics , like " capitalist , " " profit , " " labor " ; on a more familiar level , too , we take the names of our animals in vain . It is possible to describe the kind of treatment a word is getting only by examining it in use . If a speaker is reluctant to define one of his words , or to replace it by a substitute , he is probably using it emotively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between emotive and referential language , if it is not used crudely ? in crude hands it does more harm than good ? will improve our language and thinking . Among civilized human beings , quarrels and arguments become quite unnecessary . Arguments represent clashes of interests and should be discussed as such . It is by keeping normal discussion free from terms which are not referential that we take the first and biggest step in preventing it from degenerating into argument . Yet civilization needs emotive language too . Poetry // is the richest kind of emotive language . While this book will not examine in detail the nature of such language ? proposing more especially to deal with the referential language of work , business , science , and discussion ? the author 's point of view is clearly expressed in the quotation at the head of this chapter . If we could get the habit of distinguishing referential from emotive language , we would cease to expect a poet 's statements to be always open to scientific verification ; and we would not reject a poet as worthless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or politics . Nor , in the practical world , would we fall for propaganda or for high-pressure salesmanship . One is apt to slip metaphorical plugs into one 's ears and reiterate the weak cry of " do n't believe anything you hear . " It is better ( and semantics makes it possible ) to pick out and check the references and to ignore the emotions . Salesmen and leaders disapprove of such activities . Mr. Elmer Wheeler , in his celebrated Sizzle Book ( It 's the sizzle that sells the steak ? not the cow ) , tells his salesmen readers that " What is most important to remember is that these three mental pocketbooks ' are not in the logical front part of the prospect 's mind but are buried deep in the emotional hack part of the brain . You must fashion your words so that they will fly past the prospect s cold reasoning , his logical front mind , and move , emotionally , his real basic buying urges in the depth ' of his brain . " ( The punctuation is Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and expresses it in // very much the same way . His oratorical outbursts are aimed at the feelings of his hearers . He talks emotively , and knows from experience that it is best to choose the times when the logical faculties of his audience are most likely to be dull . To quote his own words : " In the morning , and during the day , men 's minds are most strongly opposed to any attempt to persuade them to adopt new decisions and new opinions . But in the evening they succumb more easily to the dominating force of a stronger will . For in truth every meeting of this sort consists of a struggle between two opposing forces . The mighty oratorical talent of the masterful leader will succeed more easily in inspiring with a new will men whose powers of resistance have already been lessened by nature than if they were still in full possession of all the resources of their mind and will . " The same end is attained by the artificial yet mysterious lighting in the Catholic churches , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In this struggle of the orator against the adversaries he wishes to convert , he gradually acquires a wonderful understanding of the psychological conditions necessary for propaganda . " Somebody should write a treatise entitled A Semantic Study of the Decisive Speeches of History . Then we would see how man through the ages has listened to emotive words and told himself that they persuaded his reason . The speech of Pope Urban II at Clermont still remains one of the greatest performances of all time . i // The Pope addressed his audience in an impressive setting . There at Clermont were assembled cardinals with purple robes , bishops with golden chapel , barons and citizens from all parts of Christendom . They gathered before a platform beneath a canopy of cloth-of-gold . Then a tall man took his stand between two glittering crosses , a man who was robed in white except for the heavy pallium over his shoulders bearing tiny crosses , and the pallium was of the same hue as his thick , curling beard . He came closer to the platform , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meadow in the summer breeze . Then Urban spoke , and , being a Frenchman , he spoke the Romance language rather than the harsher Latin : " O ye men of the Franks , who live beyond the mountains ! God hath favored you in many ways , in your happy land as in your steadfast faith and valor . To you our words are spoken , and by you our message will be passed on . We wish you to know what grievous cause has brought us hither , to your land , and what need has led us not only to you but to all the faithful . " I speak to you who are present ; I announce it to those who are absent , and Christ ordains it . " From the borders of Jerusalem and the city of Constantinople , ominous tidings have gone forth . An accursed race , emerging from the kingdom of the Persians , a barbarous people , estranged from God , has invaded the land of the Christians in the east and has depopuEMOTIVE // lated them by fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabs . " After the body of the speech , which was laden with atrocity stories , came the peroration : " Fear not torture , for therein lies the crown of martyrdom . The way is short , the struggle brief , the reward everlasting . Yea , I speak now with the voice of the prophet , Arm thyself , O mighty one ! ' Take up your arms , valiant sons , and go . Better fall in battle than live to see the sorrow of your people and the desecration of your holy places . " It would be an interesting exercise to underline all the words used emotively in the above quotation and to substitute words which were neutral in feeling ; or , better , to rewrite the whole passage restricting the paraphrase to purely referential statements . Such exercises will be discussed in detail later . In one chapter of The Epic of America the historian specifically makes the distinction we are here discussing , when he contrasts the reasoning of the merchants with the emotive speeches of Sam Adams , that past master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " While the merchants were busy pointing out to their London correspondents that the new laws would hurt the business of all alike , Adams at once struck boldly out to inflame the passions of the crowd by threatening that it was to be reduced to the miserable state of tributary slaves , ' contrasting its freedom and moral virtue with the // tyranny and moral degradation of England . He proclaimed that the mother country was bent on bringing the colonies to a condition of slavery , poverty , and misery , ' and on causing their utter ruin . " Our own age is not lacking in masters of emotive manipulation . I again quote Herr Hitler , this time in admiration of a war enemy . " I read a detailed criticism of the speeches of Lloyd George ( when merely Minister of Munitions ) which arrived at the brilliant conclusion that these speeches were second-class from the philosophical and scientific point of view , that here we had commonplace and trivial utterances . Some time later I got hold of some of these speeches , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I saw how our German penster had missed the point of these psychological masterpieces , this artistry in handling the soul of the crowd . Our man had judged these speeches exclusively from the point of view of the impression they produced upon his own sophisticated mind , while the great English demagogue had composed them with the sole aim of exercising the maximum effect over the mass of his audience , and in a wider sense the whole of the English lower classes . From this point of view , this Englishman 's speeches were prodigious masterpieces . " The author of an article on propaganda in an American journal of psychology set forth at the end four rules which he thought explained the secret of successful propaganda , the first being : rely on emotion , never argue . // Involuntary support of this rule was provided by a director of propaganda for some American power companies , who said , when asked how he would work against the election of a senator who favored government ownership of utilities : " My idea would be not to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolshevik idea on my opponent . " The foregoing examples and illustrations probably make clear enough the distinction between these two ways of using language . It should be explicitly added , however , that talking , especially talking emotively , is far from being a matter of words alone . The situation , the circumstances , as well as the gestures and expression of the speaker , all come into the picture . The emotive factors , especially , take many forms . Sometimes emotive speech may consist of so many words , which more or less stand on their own feet and can be looked at separately . But other examples are nothing but ritual , . or social gesture ? " How do you do " ; " Good-by , I had such a lovely time " ? and here analysis of the separate words would be wasted . Very often one gets a whole bunch of words acting as gestures , or signals , which are as much a unity as the gong which in some theaters is the signal that the curtain is going to rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his baby pupils to a change of occupation . Intonation and " tone of voice , " in speech , also come in on the emotive side . Emphasis , or stress , is another consideration ; though in the English language stress also has a referential func- // tion , telling the listener which ideas need his particular attention . ( For example , one can make this sentence , " She took her new green hat from that shelf , " answer nine different questions , by emphasizing the different words . ) Three Aspects of Emotive Language In view of such complications , it will be advisable to look more closely into the nature of emotive language . The secret of appreciating and criticizing any sample of : speech lies in estimating how it operates these four functions of language : Sense , Feeling , Tone , and Intention . Anyone faced with the problem of explaining the effects of a work of literature or of a masterpiece of propaganda will find it easier and better to examine them under these four headings . Observe that three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the principal factor in referential language , the language of scientific statement . Referential langiiage just says what if says , and nobody 's moods or motives come into the picture . We will give a sample of it : " Insulin is the hormone secreted by the cells of the islands of Langerhans in the pancreas . It has been obtained as a crystalline substance by J. J. Abel , but its chemical formula is not known as yet . It is concerned with the regulation of the blood sugar oxidation in the body , a deficiency due to the destruction of the cells of // the islands of Langerhans , causing diabetes . It was first extracted by C. H. Best and F. G. Banting . " This is a medical statement , though not on the technical level . You can easily think of similar statements in different fields of interest : about fishing , or bridge , or aviation , or politics , or heavy water . Such statements are examples of the language of science and of common sense . Feeling expresses how the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encyclopedist who spoke of " Insulin as - the cute little hormone secreted by the bonny cells of the islands of Langerhans " would be introcTucing the function in a way most of us would consider inappropriate . The Anglo-Indian golfing colonel who , on his arrival at Pine Valley , New Jersey , exclaimed how top-hole it was to play in such a paradise , with a lovely brook meandering its jolly little way through the course , and then at the fourteenth hole , after slicing , snarled a query about how the dickens a fellow could get a decent match when there was a sewer in the way , provides another example of the function of Feeling . The Feeling and the Tone functions find their most valuable expression in emotional literature , especially poetry . We should read more good poetry as an effective aid in retaining our sanity . Tone is the expression of the speaker 's attitude toward . , . the person he is addressing . It is a complication we all have to allow for in our dealings with people . As speaker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay this element a good deal of attention , while the listener has to sift it out before he can get the Sense of any statement . The boss tells you that it is with great regret that he dispenses with your valuable services ; the publisher tells you that undoubtedly your book has great merit , and it is highly thought of by Mr.  --  , but Mr.  - -  Tone , then , expresses what the speaker feels about his hearer . Or what the writer feels about his reader ; for in the present exposition " writing " or " speaking " mostly refers to both operations . Intention has its place in any utterance , whether it be social gossip , a novel , or a book on science , but its most obvious form is exemplified by the propagandist . He , like the rest of us , has his own feelings and interests . His way of boosting them is to incite you to do something for him . In speeches such as his , in which the Intention function is dominant , you would get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or its Feeling meant very much to the man who made the speech . The propagandist 's mind is made up . his purpose is not to get his hearers or readers to think , but to get them to think his way . And to do what he wants . Here lies the line between education and propaganda . We can all of us think of skillful examples of propaganda in which language seems to be used in a purely referential way , although the whole utterance is made for a completely different purpose . In other words , the dominating function of these examples is the function // of Intention . As social and political animals , we are today vitally interested in people 's intentions . " What 's he after ? " " Who 's behind it ? " In the midst of the blare of publicity from salesmen , politicians , churchmen , educators , and leaders of thought , we would do well to keep our weather ear open for signs of this fourth function of language . We can always profit from any Sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in addition , beware of the current tendency to use the word " propaganda " emotively . It would be worth while to examine the heads of those who maintain that all persuasion is equally bad , whatever courses it urges , bad or good . Stuart Chase has written a book on the use and misuse of ords and in one chapter he displays as horrible examples-of misuse passages by well-known writers . After presenting a passage from one of his own earlier books , through which he scatters a whole host of blab-blabs to replace words he now disapproves of , he says , " I suspect that the paragraph was really written because I wanted church people to join with me in trying to get rid of slums , poverty and economic misery . Well , why did n't I say so ? " Intention ? and one could say the same of any of the three other functions of language ? is heavy in some utterances , and in others so insignificant that it can almost be ignored . Sales talks and election speeches could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a geometry book would exemplify the other end . In analyzing any // kind of utterance , however , one must keep all four functions in mind ; otherwise , one runs the risk of wandering off into other fields of study . If we wanted to discuss Intention and intentions in general , for example , we should find ourselves discussing Sociology . This last statement may be supported by a prewar message from Berlin to the New York Times : " An agreement between the German and Polish education ministries , announced here today , provides that school textbooks will be revised to eliminate all expressions and phrases liable to offend the national feelings of either country ! " As interpreted by the German press , the agreement should lead to a dispassionate presentation of the epochs in which the two countries opposed each other . Part of the agreement calls for deletions of texts that might be interpreted as insulting or likely to injure national sensibilities . " Both Education Ministries will collaborate in this work . It is intended to extend the agreement to other branches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the report of a similar agreement between French and German historians last year , a report that was repudiated here as premature and unalltliorized . " We have to expect an overdose of Intention from the history textbooks of any nation . This completes our present analysis of the four functions of language . Nobody who uses it can fail to find it // a great help . It is easy to remember and always at hand . It enables us to weigh and assess the value of any pronouncement , any specimen of praise , prayer , poetry , or prejudice to which we may be subjected . And here we shall leave the subject , lumping the three emotive functions together again and returning to our original distinction between referential language , which draws the hearers ' attention to some state of affairs , and emotive language , which aims at expressing the speaker 's feelings and encouraging the hearer to adopt a certain attitude . In the normal way , any bit of writing contains both kinds . Echoes of Sound and Sentiment It is a sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between referential and emotive language have gone around making it with a chip on their shoulder . Some of these have described emotive language as " nonsense " , and one can not feel quite sure tliat the sting is taken completely away from the insult by their explanation that " nonsense " is a purely technical term , used referentially . Stuart Chase has rewritten passages from the writings of the great in paraphrase , replacing every word which ended in - ness or - ity or - tion or - ment or - ism by the less euphonious word " blabblab . " There is a danger here , because although some of the big abstract words ( which , as Joyce 's Stephen Dedalus said , have made us so unhappy ) are emotive enough wherever they turn up , others are referential // terms , but Fictions ? with which this book will be concerned in later chapters . " Emotive " and " Fiction " are not disparaging terms . Fictions are a linguistic necessity , and emotive language is another name for Poetry , which is a human necessity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain of our inner life are a kind of private poetry . To share the poet 's experiences is to enrich and refine this inner life . People like Auden , Eliot , Empson , MacLeish , Rukeyser , Spender , Yeats are fine and rich personalities communicating to their readers their reaction to today 's world . The values of poetry of every age come mainly through language used emotively . " Drop thy pipe , thy happy pipe ; Sing thy songs of happy cheer " : So I sung the same again , While he wept with joy to hear . " Piper , sit thee down and write In a book , that all may read . " So he vanished from my sight , And I pluck 'd a hollow reed . " And I made a rural pen , And I stain 'd the water clear , And I wrote my happy songs Every child may joy to hear . " These three verses of Blake certainly teach us nothing . They have to be read as music rather than as logic . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Byron that " Ile taught us nothing , but our soul has felt him like the thunder 's roll . " Without trying to give an explanation of any of Blake 's verses , let us loiter for a moment just to hint at the kind of richness to be savored in the enjoyment of poetry , which must be ignored in the study of referential language . For one thing , there is the physical sound of the words , together with the muscular movements that have to be made when they are spoken aloud . Try saying aloud the words " pluck " and " hollow " and see how much they can " mean " emotionally when they are said with as much " expressive " power as possible . See how the consonant which dominates the first of the above three verses suggests other words which , though absent , seem to ' ? make their presence felt : words like weep , ripe , tip , drip , lip , top , stop , drop ( tears ) . The vowel " i " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like sigh , high ( note ) , sky , eye , die . Other words are summoned by emotional or intellectual association , giving as the total effect of the first verse a feeling of beauty , sadness , and peace which the mere sense of the words certainly does not explain . Indeed , there is a kind of struggle between the sense and the feeling . A detailed discussion of the enjoyment of poetry , important though it is , lies outside our scope . The same reasons which keep the businessman from reading poetry prevent him from enjoying his vacation . And even a book which is mainly concerned with language in what one might call its steering function must give a passing // bow to the gasoline which makes the engine go and the oil which keeps it going smoothly . Chief Points There are two different uses of language , and it is necessary to keep them separate in our minds : the Emotive use and the Referential use . This book is chiefly interested in the referential language of work , business , science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing or in talk , may be viewed from four different angles , the reader or hearer looking in turn at its Sense , its Feeling , its Tone , and its Intention . Though to some degree all four are normally present in every statement , Feeling and Tone are specially important in poetry , and Intention in propaganda . Poetry is o great value in putting our feelings in order and giving us a healthy frame of mind . Practice Exercises Call me Ishmael . Some years ago ? never mind how long precisely ? having little or no money in my purse , and nothing particular to interest me on shore , I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world . It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation .

If they but knew it , almost all men in their degree , some time or other , cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me .

Below are three attempts to interpret this passage by means of analytical paraphrases. 1 . After carefully reacting all four versions , grade the paraphrases in their order of merit .

Is it true that each paraphrase contributes in some way to a richer understanding of the original ? A. Give me the name Ishmael .

It is a way I have of driving off my angry // feelings , and keeping my blood system regular . Whenever I see myself getting serious about the mouth ; whenever it is raining in my heart ; whenever I see myself stopping automatically before death-box storehouses , and going in back of every line of persons going to put a dead body in the earth ; and specially when my feelings get such an upper hand of me that my strong sense of right behavior sends me stepping into the street on purpose , and putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? then , I take into account that it is high time to get to sea as quickly as possible .

If they were but conscious of it , almost all men in their degree , some time or other , put about the same value on the sea as I do . B. Let my name be Ishmael . Some years back ? the year itself is not important ? having little or no money , and nothing specially interesting on land , I got the idea of sailing about a little , and seeing some of the waters covering the earth .

This is in place of gun or knife or cord . In delicate harmony with the twists of his thought , Cato put the weight of his body onto the point of his blade ; I quietly take to the ship . There is nothing surprising in this . If only they were conscious of it , almost all men in their degree have at some time or other very much the same feelings for the sea that I have . C. My name is Ishmael ? or that name is as good as any other . Some years back ? it is not important when ? having very little money , and nothing of special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would get in a ship and see something of the seas . It is my way of sending away my bad humors , and getting my blood in working order . Whenever I make the discovery that my face is becoming sad ; whenever there is dark wet winter weather within me ; whenever I make the discovery that I am coming to an automatic stop before those places where death-boxes are stored , and whenever , when I see a line of persons in the street taking some dead man or woman to be put away , I go with them ; and specially when my low condition of mind gets such control of me that I have trouble in keeping myself from stepping with a sense of purpose into the street , and regularly sending persons ' hats off their heads ? then I make the decision that I had // better get to sea at once . This is what I put in the place of instruments of death . In a like condition , Cato put himself to death ; I quietly take to the ship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not conscious of the fact , about all men to some degree , at some event or time , take the same viewpoint as I with respect to the sea . // WORDS We can discern in the dog 's mind the same essential processes that we use when we learn a language . WELLS , HUXLEY AND WELLS , The Science of Life . HAVING distinguished in the previous chapter between referential and emotive language , and having noted the dangers of using this distinction too freely , our next task is to see how language becomes " referential " ; that is , how it comes to have Sense ( Function 1 ) . That task is facilitated if one keeps two general notions in the back of one 's mind : first , that all the processes that we call interpretative ? seeing , hearing , feeling , smelling , and so on ? involve complicated physiological and psychological activities ; second , and this notion has a connection with the first , that a peculiar of meanngcharacterizes to_the names of all such processes ? the words already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since these terms all follow the same sort of shifts , it is not very helpful to discuss some of them by means of the others ; we must try to get behind the causes of all such shifts .

This chapter seeks to explain their nature and behavior , and the reasons for them . Let us provide a framework of comparison by examining the word sense at three obvious points of its scale : ( 1 ) We apply the word to the special physical senses of seeing , hearing , smell , taste , touch , etc. , which precede conscious experience . ( 2 ) We also use it to say that a man who can assemble the findings of his senses into a coherent picture has sense . ( 3 ) We project this faculty or quality into the things we see or hear or study and say that the sense of that statement ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is useful to keep these different senses of sense in mind . To Be Affected Is To Interpret In this chapter , I syha 11 e .. th won-1c into y - terpretation in a special way . No harm can be done , since the argument of this book does not anywhere depend upon a special interpretation of interpretation . Hereafter interprets will merely meanis . a f ectcd , by ? . interaretation will be the process of being changed or affected by something . The nature of the interpretation always depends upon the nature of the interpreter . Looked at in this way , interpretation does not necessarily involve human beings or any living creature . A // man looks out of the window , sees low black clouds covering the sky , and says it is going to rain . That is his interpretation of the weather signs . He looks at the thermometer in his room and then lights a fire . Half an hour later the thermometer has risen six degrees : that is the thermometer 's interpretation of the changed climatic conditions .

It is natural for us to suppose , unthinkingly , that we see , hear , and even understand things " in a flash , " and that these are three simple and separate activities . But elementary physiology tells us that such processes are by no means instantaneous : it is our failure to carry over this knowledge that helps to prevent us from thinking sensibly about language and thought .

He is joyously hastening toward his wife when he feels a stunning blow at the back of his // head . " Peyton Farquhar was dead ; his body , with a broken neck , swung gently from side to side beneath the timbers of the Owl Creek Bridge . " Such a story , in which the space of a few minutes is imaginatively elongated , sets a useful pattern for an attempt to contemplate sensory and thought processes in slow motion . Seeing and hearing do take time . The resident of an undesecrated London used to be able to hear the chime of Big Ben from his wireless set and then later hear the same chime coming on its old-fashioned way through the window . Radio waves travel with the speed of light , while sound waves jog along at a more leisurely pace . ( Of course , the physiological process of hearing from the radio takes as much time as hearing any other way , as soon as the stimuli become sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not instantaneous : by the time they had traveled two hundred thousand miles , over a second would have elapsed . But , compared with this speed , the **26;337;TOOLONG .. perc.eptionare almost-at a standstill . It would take the human nerves more than eight seconds to carry their fastest messages over the distance of a kilometer , which is less than a mile . When we see an object , at what stage in the journey between eying and realizing do we actually see it ? The answer is that we sec it all the time ; every different stage in the perceptive journey between an object in the world and an individual who sees it and thinks about it represents a different meaning of the verb see Similarly with // hear , smell , and other such words . They have senses which arrange themselves in a hierarchy , like steps up a ladder . Before one can decide how such a word is being used on any particular occasion one must examine as thoroughly as possible the complete process concerned . For an understanding of see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and psychology . When we talk about an object being seen , or heard , or apprehended in any way , all we say is that this object causes certain happenings in us ? chiefly in our nervous system . When I see something , my optic nerve and occipital region interpret my retina which interprets my lens which interprets the vibrations of light which interpret the object . And when I hear something , my brain interprets the auditory nerves which interpret the organ of Corti which interprets the stapes , incus , and malleus which interpret the eardrum which interprets the outer ear which interprets the vibrations of air which interpret the thing or happening which is " making the noise . " In other words , what we see or hear ? and I really should put the pronoun and the verbs in tiresome inverted commas ? is some change in a sense organ . It is the sense organ that sees or hears the object . We should never say " I perceive a Thing " without remembering that our statement means : " I interpret Sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thing changes Sense Organ which changes Me . " If there is only one chair to look at , do you and I , standing by different walls of a room , see the same chair ? // This conundrum , though generally couched in more defensive language , has tortured many a thoughtful mind . It may be asked as a question about the nature of the universe , or about what we can know about the universe , or it may simply be a linguistical or logical question about how we are to use certain words . Whatever its scope , a sensible preliminary to the answering of this question is for one to give a physical description of the given situation and a semantic account of the words in the question . The situation could be illustrated by three drawings : of your view of the chair , my view , and the view of an outsider who sees all three of us ; and these drawings could be described verbally in some such jargon as that I committed above ? subject to correction by physiologists and physicists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word same . Each of us in the process of seeing " the chair " sees any number of chairs , one to represent each stage in the seeing process ; and whether or not we see the same chair depends on which chair ( at which stage of this perceptive process ) each of us chooses to consider . When we say we have interpreted something , then , we mean that our nervous system has registered the fact that some change has taken place in certain of our sense organs . We can generally find the objects which have affected our sense organs by checking with the evidence of other senses and other people . Our primary task is not to ponder philosophically about Truth or Perception or Knowledge or Beauty , but to do our best to reconstruct // the chains of happenings that link us with the world outside us . Many errors and misunderstandings result from the neglect of this primary verification . Writers on moral and sociological subjects often stay in the clouds because they despise such spadework . Many a literary critic , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted that everybody ( himself included ) of course understands what happens whenyve react an essay or a problem m have been considered Philistine , even radical ? and not in the root sense of the word " radical " ! Dr. Richards attacks it in a chapter of his Principles of Literary Criticism . In his analysis , the first thing that happens when one reads a poem is that the reader 's eye is affected by the printed words , and this effect is quickly followed by images , and then by the reader 's thoughts about the various sensations . Then come free , unassociated images , and after that the reader 's thoughts about the various things the poem talks about . At a further stage his emotions are aroused by associations , rhythms , and other factors ; and thus slowly is built up the set.of attitudes which forms the reader 's complete reaction to the poem . This attempt to pave the way for a study of the effects of poetry had a very mixed reception : there are men of letters in all parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast upon the memory of " rare Ben Jonson " by the suggestion that people have to have eyes to read him with . // Context , Organism , Sign Before taking up the interpretation of language , however , it is advisable to look at a simpler kind of Sign ; though what is said in this chapter about signs is fully applicable to much speech , especially emotive speech . A , good thermometer interprets changes ... of temperature , as we have seen , but it has no memory . Our next concern is the interpretative process in organisms which remember and which do new things in the light of their own experiences . Such organisms have the power to interpret signs . The essential nature of a sign can be illustrated by a discussion of three familiar cases from the history of animal psychology . Lloyd Morgan saw a chicken seize a black-and-yellow caterpillar and drop it again , evidently because it had a nasty taste . Some time later the same chicken was observed to encounter another caterpillar of the same color and refuse to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chicken 's make-up some trace of the past experience as a whole ? the picking up and the unpleasant taste . Its lesson was learned . We risk little in guessing that the chicken did not think the matt.ex .. out logieaUly ; somehow it had been retuned , and the caterpillar looked repulsive . It was what in a human being wwpuld call a. . prejudice . Studies of animal learning have taught us much about the beginnings of the learning process . One experimenter put a cat in one box , and in sight of it , in another box , a // fish . In the cat 's box was a loop of string , so arranged that when the loop was pulled the door would open and the cat would be in a position to seek a peaceful settlement with the fish . The cat did a great deal of random milling about , but finally pulled the loop and got the fish . In later trials the cat pulled the string sooner , and finally got wise enough to go fairly quickly for the loop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed . One would say that the cat 's groping mind settled more and more definitely on the string as something pleasant . In his famous conditioned reflex experiments , the Russian physiologist Pavlov placed his dog on a table , with braces slung from the roof of its box to keep it still . A tube connected the dog 's cheek with a vessel ready to receive and measure the saliva secreted when the dog 's mouth watered . A drum recorded the rate of the saliva 's flow , and close at hand was an electric bell . Food was put before the dog ; and its mouth watered dutifully . Pavlov then regularly rang the bell at the same time as the food was brought . After some repetitions , he rang the bell though no food appeared , and the saliva ran just as if the dog had seen the food . As far as the dog was concerned , the bell " meant " something good to eat . These three animal stories provide an introduction to the Tory of Signs , which is fundamental to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught the animal 's attention and reminderft of a past experience . Such signs , when they attract the notice of an organism , revive the sensations originally excited by a wider context . ( By // " context " here I mean a wider and more scattered experience , in which quite a number of things occurred ; it will be necessary later to analyze this word more deeply , in its use in connection with symbols . ) It is to be noted that each experience was interesting to the animal concerned , involving something very near to its heart , as we might say . To consider in detail the essential characteristics of a sign , there are six points to be noted . 1 . A sign is an object similar to some object that has played a part in a previous experience . In semantics one generally does well to use " similar " and " like " in preference to " t re same " and " identical . " Even when we talk of things being " the same " and " identical " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and parallels and archetypes and representative examples are the tools of the student of semantics ; and if he forgets what kind of tools he is using he will not dig very far into the depths of Definition and Metaphor . To consider our three illustrations : the objects acting as signs were in no case identical objects . It seems likely that the second caterpillar was only a very distant relative of the first . In the other two experiments , it may have been the same loop and the same bell all the time ; but at different times the cat saw the string from different angles and there would doubtless be slight differences in the tone and intensity of the dog 's bell . I should say here , too , that the word " object " is used above for the sake of concreteness : the actual sign is not the object itself , but // the stimulus to the organism 's senses which is caused by the object . In all three cases the stimuli would be similar but not the same . All three objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they were formerly parts of the **28;365;TOOLONG context , and of the loop-fish-eat context , and of the bell-food-eat context . No object can become a sign unless it makes at least two appearances . 2 . The sign is interpreted by an individual organism . As I have used the word interpretation , " anything that is changed by an object ( or happening ) interprets that object , but a sign can only be interpreted . yva living organism . The process involved is well over the head of a stone or a thermometer . The organism has the capacity to take an object at more than its face value , to react to a sign as if that sign were the whole context . Reflection upon this point makes us realize that individuals differ enormously from one another , whether they are birds or human beings . Individual geese and ganders differ in far more than meets the eye . A diagram may clarify **26;395;TOOLONG relation , which in the next chapter will be compared and contrasted with the relation symbolized by the Triangle of Reference . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of which remains in the organism . Note especially that the sign which " signifies " the context has no direct connection with that context . The two are connected only through the organism . The sign , as a sign , is purely arti- // ficial , and utterly dependent for its existence on the individual organism . 3 . The interpretation of a sign depends upon the organism 's past experience . This seeming platitude is crucial . Not only does this particular interpretation depend on this particular experience ( or a repetition of similar experiences ) , but the way the animal tackled this experience depended ? I do not know to what extent ? on past sign-situations , which // in their turn were connected with earlier situations , and so on back to the animal 's babyhood. 4 . The context interests the organism . In all three of our illustrations , the organism was interested in satisfying its hunger . Such urges as hunger , sex , and the desire to escape danger are obvious incentives to animal learning . 5 . The sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain energy , or intensity : it must be bright enough , or loud enough , or hard enough to excite the sense organs of the creature concerned . In a bad light the chicken might still seize a nasty caterpillar . It is probable , too , that the first caterpillar had subtle markings which could indicate its nonedibility more reliably than mere crude color , and that many black-and-yellow caterpillars are extremely eatable . It may be that the fowl did notice such markings in detail ; but one can not expect too much of a chicken . 6 . Signs are not permanent . Animals are less conservative about their signs than many people seem to be about their symbols . Pavlov found that when he stopped serving food the bell did not remain effective for very long . The dog 's mouth soon ceased to expect a meal . No complete record of our cat 's life history is available , but we would be ready to bet that he did not spend the rest of his life looking for loops . These are all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition to applying them to the examples given above , it is helpful to reflect upon which of them are applicable to words ; for example , to recently acquired words in one 's vocabulary . The matters discussed in this chapter are the subject of philosophical and Iinguistic controversy . Much of this controversy is waste motion , because little is known of what takes place in animal and human " interpretation " ? that is why the word is used here with such modest assumptions . Some readers may object that this chapter has taken Causation or Causality for granted. ; but the answer to this objection would be that if cause ( or change or affect , which are linked to cause ) is taken for granted , the only assumption made is that as a word it undoubtedly exists . As such , it may be treated as a sign , possessing a sign 's specified characteristics . This difficulty will , it is hoped , be further clarified by the next chapter , which is intended to throw more light upon the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an endeavor to explain and illustrate the use of two terms essential to the technical vocabulary with which I shall describe 1in uisticsituations . These two terms are sign and context . Sign is established , and context is clear enough for the present but will need further analysis in its connection with verbal communication . The final test of the adequacy of this chapter will be the success of these terms in performing their descriptive functions . // Chief Points Seeing , hearing , and learning are complex processes . Science at the present time is able to give us knowledge in some detail of the different stages by which outside things get in touch with our minds . What our brain sees is not the thing we are " looking at , " but the changes in our eyes of which that thing is the cause . If we keep this order of events in mind , we are in less danger of error . Lt.earning.is an animal 's ( or a man 's ) reaction to Signs : . A.S.i ... E.isa .. partof an experience , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal 's attention , has the same effect as the complete experience had in the .. past , . Practice Exercises I. Describe in terms of signs and contexts how a child might learn these words : label , affect , merry . II . Describe in similar terms how a human being sees and recognizes a chair . What is the sign ? Can such a sign be false ? SYMBOLS : A WORD IS A SIGN OF THOUGHT Words are wise men 's counters , they do but reckon by them ; but they are the money of fools . THOMAS HOBBES , Leviathan . A SYMBOL is a word used referentially . It is a special sort of sign : a word is always a sign , but not always a symbol . Let us verify the fact that words have the six characteristics attached to signs in the third chapter . Every time a certain word is spoken , written , or printed , it needs to resemble other sounds or marks closely enough to be recognizable as similar to them . Unless we are thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when somebody writes a word badly , or mispronounces it . Secondly , a word can only be used by individual people , whose use and recognition of it depends upon their past experiences . Like the bell to which the dog responds , any word , whether acting as a symbol or not , must receive individual attention . Language may be compared with food . The French linguistic psychologist Delacroix has made an apt comparison in pointing out that food might be piled mountains high all over the world , but it would only become actual food by virtue of the chemical and physiological proc-78 // esses of digestion by individuals . Words might be stacked away in libraries everywhere ; but we must never forget ? it is the function of the Triangle of Reference to make it impossible for us to forget ? that without human interpretation they can not be symbols , or even signs . Interest on the part of the human being , and intensity in the sign or symbol , are also essential . We must be able to see or hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can interpret it . And , lastly , things change , thoughts change , and words change . No student of semantics can for very long forget that words are not immutable . Symbols , however , can be clearly distinguished from other signs . In a symbol-situation intentional communication occurs ? there is a speaker as well as a listener , a writer as well as a reader . Looking at the diagram ( page 81 ) , one needs to remember the reciprocal nature of this process : the Triangle illustrated applies to the speaker , and the hearer 's triangle would go the other way ? from symbol to thought to referent . One of the chief things to be noted about symbols is that they imply a double consciousness on the part of speaker and listener . The speaker means to use symbols in order to communicate ; the listener interprets the words as symbols . A symbol differs from other signs in a second way . It is more abstract , and demands more discrimination from its interpreter . Even animals can understand words after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accustomed to a word like " food " or " fish " or " salmon , " and whenever // it hears the word responds with some indication that it is looking for service . This does not mean that the cat interprets such a word exactly as we interpret the word " pig " in the Triangle below . The animal reacts to the memory of the whole context ; but civilized man , exercising further discrimination , singles out objects , and to a greater degree leaves himself out of the picture . The interpreter of even the simplest symbol is on the third rung , as it were , of the interpretative ladder , the inanimate thermometer being on the first and the more malleable organism on the second . Man can , if he keeps his wits about him , climb indefinitely higher by sorting his symbols for different purposes : as when he calls a beetle an " insect , " an " animal , " or an " organism " ; or measles a " disease " or a " handicap " ; or grass-green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of such groupings and sortingsof generalizations , abstractions , Fictions , metaphors , and so on ? will be considered in later chapters . These , however , are relatively sophisticated problems . When our thinking goes wrong , it is nearly always because we have forgotten the simple truth that there is a difference between the name and the thing for which the name stands . The doll is not Cinderella herself . The label is not the overcoat . The signpost is not the city . The map is not the country . The book in the library is not the same as the happenings outside the library . The symbol is not the referent . The Referent is the object referred to , the Thought is // the act of reference , and the Symbol is the name . Before any object can have a name , such a name must be invented ; and the constant intervention of man is necessary if the name is to keep alive . Referent , Thought , Symbol Imagine yourself to be looking at a signpost , near Schenectady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Schenectady . The post has the word " Schenectady " plastered on its arm , which points east . Somewhere in that direction , at the end of the Dyke , over the Mohawk // River , embracing the bridge and Washington Avenue , lies the referent , your destination ? Schenectady . Which three factors in this situation correspond with the three corners of the Triangle above ? It is useful to keep the signpost analogy in one 's head , as a means of recalling and verifying the Triangle . This Triangle of Reference is the one detail in this book which needs to be remembered outright , by force if necessary . If the reader lost his book he could build up again for himself the subject matter of semantics , on the basis of the Triangle of Reference ; for he would study as his subject matter words from his own individual experience , and the normal occasions on which he uses such words ; and he could describe these matters in ordinary language . This is the best way to describe them . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical terminology , but to my mind the more profitable course is to use a minimum of technical terms and strive to prepare the reader to see the referents of semantics ( which in this case are ideas ) whatever the symbols into which they are translated . If this book fulfills its purpose the reader will pursue his semantic interests in other volumes , especially in those to which this book makes reference . The Triangle will keep him oriented . What is more , reflection upon all that these triangular relationships imply can not fail to renew his faith in education by , through , and for the democratic process , as well as giving him that respect for hard facts which is often supposed to be the privilege of totalitarians. // The subtitle of this chapter is taken from Jeremy Bentham 's definition : " A word is a sign of thought . " Bentham may have exaggerated ; sometimes it is hard to believe that people are devoting any cerebral attention to what they are saying . One can safely say that a word is a sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a symbol . A symbol must have a referent . It often happens that a word is merely a sign to the hearer when there actually is a referent in the mind of the speaker . But sometimes even the speaker has no referent to keep his word up to standard . Are we always talking referentially when we speak of " the universal joint , " or of " democracy " ? We have already seen that " semantics " runs a similar danger . There are some words , too ? of which the reader had best find his own examples from the terminologies of various myths and religions ? which never did have any referents , though they have been used millions of times with the blithe assumption that they stand for something . Their use seems to follow the principle of the old Bible-punchers , who used to read on at the top of their voices till they came to a hard word , for which they would substitute " Jericho . " Word Magic Men have always justly respected the usefulness of language ; and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only a step from talking as a means of organizing one 's thoughts and activities to simply talking , and trusting the words to do the work . This is like giving // orders without having a subordinate to carry them out . Words do so much with our help that we unconsciously expect them to do more than they can . And the consequence is that words act upon us like a magic spell . We are word-bedeviled . Some old folk tales are very enlightening on this point . Folklore is a rich field for semantic study , and such research would give us a great deal of information about the awe-inspired attitude toward words which we inherit with them . The same stories crop up again and again in different parts of the world . It was natural for man to respect his words , which were helping him so rapidly to increase his control over his environment . It was inevitable that his words should get congealed in myths and religions , and later become a retarding influence . The Grimm collection of German folk stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was also long known in England and Scotland , under the respective names of Tom-Tit-Tot and Whippitystoorie . In the German version , a miller made the foolish boast that his daughter could spin straw into gold . The King ordered her to do it , under forfeit of her life . A mysterious little man came to her aid and for three nights spun straw into gold . Then she married the King . But she had promised the little man her first-born child . When the child was born , he came back to hold her to her pledge ; but her grief so touched him that he offered to withdraw his claim if she could guess his name . She thought up // every uncommon name she could but to no avail . Messengers scoured the kingdom , seeking outlandish names , and finally one of them discovered the truth . So came that triumphant hour when she was able to ask : " Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN ? " There is a similar story of a cannibalistic troll who built a church for a farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The troll claimed the farmer 's child . The distracted father was lucky enough to hear a female troll hushing a baby to sleep with the soothing words : Tomorrow comes thy father Zi With Christian blood for thee . Zi considered himself at a fatal disadvantage now that his name was known , and the farmer never saw him again . Wherever he lives , man commits the fallacy of looking'A upon words as independent things , with powers and a life of their own . The Eskimo who has offended the white man 's law will change his name and consider himself immune from further interference . If you swear at an Arab of the old school , he will fall flat on the ground , to let the words fly harmlessly over his head . The late Serenus Sammonicus offered the magic triangle based on the word " abracadabra " as a sovereign cure for fever , flux , and toothache . Until a few years ago , the names of beheaded Chinese were collected once every year , written on pieces of paper , and ceremoniously burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked upon as // quite dead until their names had been formally destroyed . And today we are all of us apt to yield without even taking the count when we are attacked by such words as Alma Mater , Americanism , Democracy , Honor , and Isolation . Coue , the autosuggestionist , who was word-bedeviled himself , would have done useful work if he had encouraged his disciples to chant every day : " The word is not the thing . The word is not the thing . The word . . . " How Referential Language Works The word " referential , " introduced in the second chapter , now has a richer meaning if this discussion has been profitable . The person who efficiently interprets referential language remembers the three corners of the Triangle . He is conscious of himself as the apex , with the words on one hand and the objects on the other . Let the reader make the experiment of reading the Encyclopaedia 's description of insulin on page 50 . He will need to consult books of reference to get a clearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him go into these symbols as deeply as he can , and then read slowly through the paragraph , trying to conjure up pictures of the actual things and people described ? all of them ? and making sketches and diagrams if he is not good at producing mental images . This sets a standard for the kind of reading which really puts the brain to work . The Triangle of Reference enables one to judge any // book which is supposed to be informative . One should be able to translate its crucial paragraphs into different symbols , and to summarize and exemplify its chief points . The reader need not always sing small before a book which he has failed to understand . There will be times when he can parody Shakespeare 's Cassius , and say : The fault , dear writer , is not in ourselves But in the book , that has no Referents . Shifts and Changes of Meaning Not for a day is any language static . It is like one 's wardrobe ? though with clothes one can make more drastic clean sweeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shoes yield their place of honor to competitors , or there an old coat is forever discarded . It is the same with words . And some of them remain in circulation but change their meanings , like erstwhile ties now doing service as sashes . It is not our province here to study the history of words and their meanings , nor to see how English words have cropped up and disappeared and changed their senses . It seems advisable , however , to give a few illustrations of the fact that there are three different tracks along which a word can change its direction . First of all , we must note that " change " itself has two clearly different senses . To change a coat may mean to make alterations in it or to discard it for another , and changing a word involves a similar ambiguity . So when we speak broadly // of words having three different kinds of change ? change of referent , change of thought , change of symbol ? we must remember that " change " has this trick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of change in its referent ; a new Victory bearing the name of Nelson 's famous old flagship serves as an example of a completely different referent , while the word " table " may have a piece of furniture or a list of statistical figures for its referent . , , It is harder to distinguish change in the thought about the referent , partly because thoughts are less easy to discuss than words and things . We tend to add to the old thoughts , but not to discard them ; much as we learn more about the physical composition of chairs than our grandfathers did , yet still tend , as they did , to sit on them . Our thought about the sun , for instance , is a richer conception than people had in the days of Joshua ; but the sun still serves us as a lamp and as a clock , and it still awes us . Symbol changes , however , may be either partial or complete . The symbol may be contracted or otherwise altered , as when " cadet " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from " omnibus " ; or the referent may acquire a totally different name , like the reconditioned submarine Squalus or those American destroyers which now fly the White Ensign of Great Britain . Historically , the process of semantic change shuttles about among these three factors . But within our thoughts , our symbols every day follow far more subtle and complicated patterns of shift . The analysis of such // patterns gives us new tools for controlling our thoughts . Seven of the most important patterns are : the shift along the Scale of Perception , the shifts from Process to Product and from Agent to Action , and the conditions or processes of Symbolization , Archetypation , Pregnancy , and Metaphor . VVe will briefly consider these seven here ; other aspects of some of them will be treated in the chapters on Definition and Metaphor . The Scale of Perception This scale or hierarchy was discussed in the last chapter , in connection with symbols like " see " and " interpret . " Could the reader describe the connection between the three different " views " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would get a better view of the view from the other side of the river " ? Process ? Product Such processes as building , cutting , education , learning , ruining , understanding , and wasting yield such products as buildings , cuts and cuttings , education , learning , ruins , understanding , and waste . Agent ? Action The person or body of persons which cause a certain process or action to take place frequently share the name of that process . " Committee " and " government " are examples of this pattern , and so are " cook " and " guide . " // Symbolization This pattern has much in common with the processproduct and the archetypation groups , but is important enough to be considered as a special case . It represents a process-product relationship in the same way that a symbol is the product of a thought . It occurs whenever a symbolized ( usually a written ) statement is treated as if it were the thoughts and processes which led up to the statement . Codified statements of court " laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is a law ? a written statute , the process of passing it , or the operation of enforcing it ? And what is grammar ? a set of unwritten laws of thought , the rules in a grammar book , or the " authorities " who tell us when we go wrong ? We tend unthinkingly to worship the written word . Archetypation This is the process of anchoring a word to some lucid and typical example of its use . The process of " advertisement " is archetyped by " an advertisement . " Archetypation is especially useful in the study of language itself : it is the method of this book to exemplify by archetypes the mental processes involved when one uses symbols , referents , metaphors , Fictions , and so on . The shift of " case " from Al to A2 ( page 35 ) seems to me another example of archetypation. // Pregnancy Mr. John O'Hara described a certain playwright as someone " who writes one hell of a lot , but does n't write very much . " The second " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which there is an intensified focusing on what is taken to be the essence of the word 's meaning . On page 35 , the second sense of " body " ( A2 ) exemplifies such focusing , in this case upon the idea of man without thought or emotion or life ? a real or mere body . The arts of understatement would flourish if it were better understood that any word has this power to supercharge itself and produce what a gasoline-plus salesman would describe as that little bit extra . Cut down the description of one 's neighbor as " a man who has a great deal of property " or " high personal qualities , " and he becomes " a man of property , " or " a man of quality . " In the latter case , one may pay him the still higher compliment of focusing upon the central word , and simply saying that he is " a man . " Metaphor Think of several parts of the body , and of how early in life we learned to lend , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why metaphor plays so strong a part in language . Though nouns often provide the handiest examples for discussion , other parts of speech are just as open to metaphorical use . Verbs , for example : // when we give advice , or take heed of it , we do not generally perform the physical operations of giving or taking . When a problem is in the mind , or under consideration , those spatial relationships are metaphorical . Black looks and sharp words are similarly removed from the kinds of sense experience which yield archetypes for these two adjectives . Some sort of similarity is clearly the basis of all metaphor , but we must guard against linking our ideas of metaphor too tightly with the idea of visible resemblance . The similarity in a metaphor may be one of function , or of relative position , or of a score of other properties . Few " bottlenecks " look much like the neck ( itself a metaphorical neck ) of a bottle . The " bodies " of pages 35 ? 36 in A4 , A5 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different kinds . How would the reader distinguish between them ? Neither metaphor ( see Chapter 7 ) , shift of meaning , nor definition ( Chapter 6 ) can be considered in isolation , for some of their areas overlap . Often the question of how to classify a word depends on the point of view one adopts toward it ; it can be looked at from different angles . Such ambiguity leads to no difficulties that a statement of the problem will not immediately solve . Take this line of reasoning . All men are mortal . Mrs. X is a woman . Therefore Mrs. X is not necessarily mortal . Does " man " here mean " human being " or " male hu- // man being " ? If the latter , there is a good argument for the conclusion ; but if it means human beings in general it is connected to the more limited sense of " men " in the same whole-part relation which connects " poultry " with " cocks , " and is similar to the connection between " rodents " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and definition merge here . Or consider again our word " body . " Which course does the reader prefer ? to say that , without any suspicion of metaphorical usage , the word can be legitimately applied to : 1 . All material objects ? 2 . Living creatures alone ? 3 . Only human beings ? The reader will see that upon his conception of the central sense of " body " depends his judgment on when that word is being used metaphorically . The semantically minded reader will be willing to see it as any one , or as all three simultaneously , and out of consideration for his fellow conversationalist he will take it or leave it alone as a metaphor . In case this seems a hairsplitting example , let us put " foot " in its place . Feet become paws as soon as we talk of animals , and the human term is frequently inappropriate . Many foreign languages are more touchy than English on this point : a Frenchman will not fail to take a reference to the foot ( pied ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to people . The reader should refer back to this section when he comes to the chapter on Definition ; and further links // with shift of meaning will be established in Chapter 7 , in which Metaphor , too , will be dealt with more fully . False Symbols and Complex Referents Symbols of model clarity , like our " pig , " have two noteworthy properties . First , they are the equivalents of complete sentences . There is here no essential difference between words and sentences . To say the word " pig " is the same as saying " pigs exist " or " there are such things as pigs . " Accompanied by the gesture of pointing , the utterance of the name represents direct symbolization , which is the fundamental form of definition : " That is a pig . Second , words used on this level are either true statements or falsehoods . If one uses the word " pig " and points at something not a pig , one is lying . Similarly , if one uses " blilltum " as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because there is no such object . At least two objections to this standpoint may be anticipated . What about the symbols used in stories and novels and poems ? Their referents do not necessarily exist ; must they be classed as falsehoods ? This complicated question can here be side-stepped with the remark that only the referential function of language is now under consideration . But how about hypotheses ? how does semantics account for the way in which we all , scientist and workingman alike , venture to put forward words with a question mark , as suggestions , as a kind of guess ? This vital matter , which will take us farther into the fields of metaphor // and Fictions , is out of place with words of primitive lucidity like " pig . " For present purposes we are talking in terms of white or black ? truth or falsehood . Words like " unicorn " and " ghost " and " Loch Ness monster " are just plain lies . Most falsehoods , however , are more complicated matters . Instead of being bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The referent of a whole chapter in a book is composed of a bundle of referents ; and the chapter does not tell the truth unless it gives the reader a correct idea of how these referents really hang together . Most referents are complex , whether or not they can be represented by a single symbol . It makes no difference to a material referent whether it is symbolized by one word or by many , by one symbol or by the definition of that symbol . Different languages treat any given situation with varying degrees of conciseness . For instance , the French word debarquons means " let us get off the ship " ; but the referent is not simplified by the fact that the French can cope with it in one symbol . What applies to a phrase or a chapter applies also to whole speeches , articles , theses , and books . A classics professor is said once to have encouraged a student to write a thesis on the influence of Virgil on some obscure Latin poet . A year went by , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole pile of interesting material showing similarities between the two poets in style , expression , thought , and so on . But now it was discovered that the obscure poet had died before Virgil 's time . The // research work was a falsehood because the actual order of the referents had been confused . The problem of muddled referents was clearly stated by the old preacher in the South who was explaining what he meant when he used the word " phenomenon . " " If you see a cow , that 's not a phenomenon . If you see a briar , that 's not a phenomenon . And if you see a bird that 's singing , that 's not a phenomenon either . But if you see a cow sitting on a briar and singing like a bird , that , brethren , is a phenomenon . " As we proceed from rough general ideas to more precise knowledge of a thing , it changes in our minds from a simple to a complex referent . ( We must not confuse change-of-thought with change-of-referent , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other referents . ) We imagine things are simple until we get to know them ; the mastery of any subject consists largely in seeing its complexities . " Is It Good English ? " The big job of anybody communicating is to communicate ? to get his meaning across , to make his hearer think of the same referents that he himself has in mind . " Grammar " is not nearly as important as we suppose . It is curious that whenever we think about language , and especially about grammar , we tend to think of writing or print , and ignore those everyday situations which vitalize our linguistic powers . Take down in shorthand the conversation of ordinary people and you will get a // record which reflects the subject-predicate formulations of the grammar books far less than one would expect . Semantics is practical . The reader will quickly see what there is about the referents of the following words ? which represent different grammatical parts of speech ? that makes those words able to do the work of complete sentences . Go ! Up ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Contact ! Tight ! Quickly ! They would cause many a grammarian 's headache over whether they were verbs in the imperative mood , or articulated parts of complete but partly unarticulated sentences , or what ; but few confusions of interpretation would arise over their use . Even though a book on language professes to be merely descriptive , it becomes a linguistic influence on its own account if people read it . Subjects like grammar or phonetics are bound to be normative as well as descriptive . Grammar books must have some effect upon spoken English , though I doubt if they have much . What does make us prefer certain forms of speech to others ? In the past , the big cities where all men met exerted the strongest influence . The great cities of Europe set standards of usage for the spoken Western languages . Today the world is the meeting place for English ; we no longer imitate the English of any particular region ; and we are getting to know too much about language to want to copy anyone slavishly . Dr. Leonard Bloomfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found even there people who spoke " ungrammatically , " although there was no writ- // ten grammar . Certain others were respected for their skill with language , and imitated . In the present uncertain state of English grammar , we would probably do well to consult on matters of usage only persons who are obviously more skillful speakers or writers than ourselves ; and to consult grammarians only if we want to write a grammar ! There are as many different sorts of grammar as there are purposes for fixing linguistic rules . If English is one 's native tongue , the attempt to digest a grammar book is apt to do more harm than good . Those who have not learned the language in an English-speaking community may need some artificial brand of " grammar " prepared for foreign learners . But in either case , there is little to learn by formal methods except the different forms of the English pronouns and verbs ? the cases and the tenses . Even here uniformity is not quite complete ; and , also , such distinctions as that between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen him three times " rest upon delicate shades of meaning , and soon become semantic rather than grammatical questions . This seems the right moment to propose for English syntax the " go-as-you-please " period that Sir Richard Paget suggested for our spelling in his book on Human Speech . We have run ahead of our grammarians , whose science is still rooted in archaic Greek and Latin , and who have panted to revise their views on " adjectives " to keep up with paper napkins , yes men , up-and-coming politicians , and down payments . // While in Peiping , I. A. Richards wrote a course of English syntax for Chinese students , beginning with sentence patterns that were models of clarity , and from them gradually working forward till all the elements of English syntax had been introduced . For home consumption , a straightforward grammar of this kind , showing the connections between all our common types of sentence with model sentences , and also discussing the forms , functions , and positions of words by comparison with the words of such pattern sentences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when its classifications become too complex ; it becomes an attempt by tinkering and renaming and patching to make watertight a system which by its nature can never be watertight . Diminishing returns set in . As far as the practical purposes of language are concerned , one would be more usefully occupied in working out a grammar for oneself . The sovereign test of any utterance lies in its success in communicating ; and clarity ( with economy , one aspect of clarity ) must always be the speaker 's chief concern . If he pursues these diligently , he will acquire correctness en passant . However , there is a money side to this question . It appears that many people lose good jobs because they ignore the rules of accepted English usage . The worst offenders are those who once took a great deal of trouble to learn arbitrary rules and who do not see why their juniors should not take the same trouble . Those same juniors would do well to ascertain discreetly who the // relevant authority is and " bone up " on him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snobbish about " grammar " than their fellows who became teachers or professors or writers . There is no harm in making up one 's mind to follow usage , if one can discover what it is ? as long as one does it with a grain of salt and takes occasional time off to reflect upon what a grammarian is , and where he gets his rules . " Grammar " interpreted on this level is a breadand-butter question , not a subject for intellectual inquiry . C. K. Ogden considers that the various linguistic fields of grammar , philology , phonetics , rhetoric , semantics , should take their respective places in relation to a central subject which he would call Orthology . Words have not received their due . When we want to take up a special study , to learn a trade or pastime or science , we generally take some trouble to get acquainted with its terminology . We do not take its symbols for granted ; we examine them , we make trials and errors , we experiment with the actual objects it is concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that up to now we have done no such thing with language , which should be the foundation subject of all subjects . The little child should be encouraged to see , hear , touch , smell , draw , and experiment with the referents of the words he uses ? for which the words are only symbols . Childhood is the period when the relation between words , thoughts , and things , which the Triangle of Reference symbolizes , // should be presented to our conscious minds . ( Not in the form of dissertations on the Triangle itself , naturally ! ) As it is , we pick up our working vocabulary in a haphazard way , simply as so many signs , before we can read ; perhaps we are given some drill in superficial aspects of some of our words , such as their conventional spelling ; and by the time we are big enough to use the dictionary we are using it to look up the difference between " expose " and " exposure " ; or to find out whether the word we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child is seldom properly trained in the mastery of those primary words to which his more sophisticated vocabulary should be anchored . There would be no need to make a fuss if all words were as simple as " pig , " or if man had gone through the ages thinking fervently all the time about the Triangle of Reference . Our heritage is a language the bulk of whose words are ambiguous , and we need to know their ways if we are to steer them and not let them throw us . Their ambiguity ceases to be a danger and becomes an added resourcefulness when we realize the kinds of change they undergo . Semantics analyzes these changes and makes us conscious of them . The moral is not that a word should have only one referent , but that it should have only one referent at a time , and that when we shift its meaning we should realize what we are doing . Nor is there any need for continual self-consciousness about it ; one can ordinarily use the words as they come , with the comforting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused , the semantic techniques can he called on . The basis of these techniques is the memory of the three corners of the Triangle . How We Abuse Words We have considered the errors which result when people regard a symbol as a cause rather than an effect . The chain goes the other way : Object caused Thought which caused Name . But man looked upon the name , and saw that it was good ; and his verbal enthusiasm got the better of him . We have examples of the outcome in the infant who began his composition : " A rabbit is called a rabbit because he has long ears and a white tail and bunny fur " ; and in the clergyman who declared with spirited benevolence : " The Divine is rightly so called . " Many examples of similar confusions on erudite levels are displayed in The Meaning of Meaning , which also quotes a witty educationist 's definition of a " wousin . " What is a wousin ? It is a Negro climbing over a railfence with a melon under his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer who provided the symbol for this rather complex referent remarked that " if this collocation of phenomena were of frequent occurrence , and if its happening were likely to affect the money market , we should have some such name as wousin ' to denote it by . People would in time be disputing whether the existence of a wousin involved necessarily a railfence , and whether the term could be applied when a white man was similarly related to a stone wall . " // A few years ago there was some vogue for the parlor game of " definitions . " " What 's a Bloogle ? " " A Bloogle is a man who goes round with a torch to see if all the lights are out . " " What 's a Sneath ? " " A Sneath is somebody who crawls about on his hands and knees to see how many of his centipedes have chilblains . " " What 's a Plimp ? " ? etc . But some of them were funny . One is at a loss for good examples ? no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject , and for one reason or another those that stick in the mind are not very quotable . Games like this help to show how accidental and arbitrary our words and definitions may be in their origins . Another game which is not unprofitable is that of defining the unspoken meanings of certain people when they use certain words . Our friends of political interests see " communists " and " fascists " and " fifth columnists " and " Trojan horses " and " warmongers " everywhere . What are the meanings of those words as they use them ? There are educational institutions where " an incompetent teacher " is one whose intellectual outlook is unacceptable to the less literate of their governors . Parents and politicians are apt to regard a " good " child as one who has not sufficient curiosity to be enterprising . To some patrons of art , an aesthetic masterpiece is something which cost so many thousands of dollars . And so on . Living up to one 's definitions involves courage and honesty as well as intelligence . // Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A symbol is an outstretched finger pointing to a Referent . Words have in great part been responsible for the increase in man 's control over the things about him . But man is frequently overcome by his words . This is because not one of us is completely free from the error of looking on words as if they had a separate existence , with strange powers of acting by themselves . We are in - far less danger of making this error if we keep clearly before our minds the order of the three parts of this chain : Referent ? Thought ? Symbol . Practice Exercises I. Draw a rough Triangle of Reference for the symbol chair . Compare it with the diagram on page 81 ? especially the base of your Triangle . II . Make a short list of words which in your experience are very frequently misused . III . Write down a few words which you yourself have trouble in using adequately . IV . Start a file or a notebook in which to collect examples from your reading of different uses of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will have examples of all their chief uses and be able to see which kinds of meaning-shift render them troublesome . CONTEXTS : A SYMBOL HAS MEANING ONLY IN ITS CONTEXT Anything has a cause , and the cause of anything is everything . W. J. TURNER SYMBOL can have no meaning apart from its context . When we follow up this assertion we become involved in three peculiar difficulties . The most troublesome is that nobody will quarrel with it : almost every reader will be ready to accept it , will be fairly anxious to move on to something else . Yet , though we may accept it , it is doubtful whether we remain aware of it ; that is the second difficulty . The third is that our intellectual acceptance is generally on the common-sense level ; and here it is necessary to go deeper than that . Thus , the tasks of this chapter are to bring home in a practical manner the importance of contexts , and also to explain why the recognition of their importance calls for scientific conviction rather than good intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second chapter , that an adequate description of an utterance must take into account , besides its referents , the attitudes of at least two people . And the technique of multiple defini-105 // tion which was explained in the Introduction merely represents an attempt to set forth the different sorts of context in which a given word can usefully occur . Flow did the reader manage to arrange the different senses of " case , " on pages 34 and 35 , unless by judging the word to have different contexts ? Contexts , however , do not always consist of words . We saw in the third chapter that a context is a bundle of things which happen together . Its different factors may be specified ? for example : hunger , caterpillar color , caterpillar shape , nasty taste ? but to any list we make we must add the factor x , to stand for the particular relationships which bind the bundle together into a system . There is a causal connection between the various factors in a context , or , at least , the organism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as the sign-situation is concerned , causes the causation . On future occasions , the recurrence of some or even one of the factors may bring back the " memory " of the whole experience : the color means the other things . As Dr. Richards expresses it in The Philosophy of Rhetoric : " What a sign or word means is the missing parts of the context . " So any word we utter never means itself , but all the other relevant factors , in the relevant contexts in which it has previously occurred ! Contexts at Work The importance of contexts can easily be established , if the reader will co-operate in one or two experiments . // The first calls for " referential reading " of the kind he was asked to do with the paragraph on Insulin , although this time the material is less technical and notes and diagrams will not be necessary . It is a story from Herodotus , which is to be read closely and , for purposes of the experiment , considered as historical fact . Introduction A boastful king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom he confided his most delicate secrets . One of his favorite topics was the beauty of his queen , a lady of unparalleled modesty . The courtier politely agreed with his royal master 's eulogies , but never with enough enthusiasm to satisfy the monarch . " He must see for himself , " the king decided . So he insisted upon his friend 's hiding behind a door in the corner of the royal bedchamber . The courtier , not liking the idea , at last very grudgingly obeyed ; and the queen saw him when he was slinking from the bedroom . She was outraged . Next day she sent for the courtier and gave him the choice of two courses . Either he must kill the king , or he must die himself . She would never tolerate her present disgrace . What was the courtier 's decision ? This story has two different endings . Read the first , which follows immediately . First Version The bewildered courtier begged her not to bind him to so terrible a choice . But since he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either to kill or be killed , he considered it more advisable to remain alive . " Your Majesty , " quoth he , " since you pitilessly compel me to take the life of my king , let me hear the manner in which we shall set upon him . " " Of a truth , " replied she , " our treason shall be performed on the very spot where he shamed me . The assault shall be given when he is asleep . " The wretched courtier , unable to escape this predicament , obliged to kill or to be killed , went with the queen to her room , and stood secretly in the corner ; and afterwards emerged and assassinated the king , thus winning his spouse and his kingdom . Now read again the Introduction , not the First Version , and then jump to the second ending , reading it carefully with a view to describing the difference between the two endings . Second Version The dumfounded gentleman entreated her not to hold him to such a hard condition . Yet as all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was necessary to slay or be slain , he deemed it better to live himself . " My Lady , " said he , " as you force me without mercy to become guilty of the blood of my sovereign , tell me by what means the deed must be accomplished . " " In sooth , " she answered , " the treachery must be effected in that same place in which he betrayed me . The attack must be made while he is sleeping . " The poor gentleman , placed in this dreadful dilemma of having to slay or be slain , followed his lady to her chamber and hid behind the door ; whence later he came out and murdered his sovereign , and gained both his lady and his crown . // When we come to discussing the difference between the two endings , there is little to discuss . They are the same . The same pictures or events or ideas came to the reader 's mind in both cases ? if he really read them referentially , remembering that words are not things and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you will not agree that the two referents ( " things referred to " ) are the same , how much do they differ ? by what percentage , if we can make a rough estimate in numbers ? Fifty per cent ? No . Ten per cent ? Probably not . But let us be generous and say 15 per cent . The referents of the two versions differ by not more than 15 per cent . But how does it happen that the difference is so small ? There is a huge difference between the symbols used in the two versions . Altogether , 160 different words are used ; and only 22 of them are used for both versions of the ending . ( According to my count they are : a , and , be , he , her , him , his , in , is , it , me , my , not , of , or , she , that , the , this , to , which , you . Take a passing look at these highly interesting words ? they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twenty-two is not a very high proportion of 160 ? it is well under 15 per cent . Why is there not an 85 per cent difference between the two sets of referents ? Our linguistic conscience rebels against such a statistical approach : the problem is one of contexts rather than of percentages . We can express it simply by supposing that the two passages used respectively symbols // A , B , C and C , D , E to stand for the same context : abcdex ; this is a vast oversimplification of the complexities , but it gives the right idea . The context of anything is the frame or field or setting in which it exists . The idea is familiar enough to anyone who has used words like " environment , " " milieu , " or " system . " Three Types of Contexts In semantics there are three types of contexts : symbol contexts , psychological contexts , and physical contexts . In normal speech we tend to take it for granted that a context is always a symbol context . Probably we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave 's this , Sirrah ? ' Mine , sir . ' I think it be thine indeed , for thou liest i n't . ' Explain these words with reference to their context . " Sometimes the essential context of a group of words consists of other words ; but sometimes it does not . The film critic of a newspaper dislikes a picture , and writes in his review that it is " definitely a good picture from which to stay away . " Then the theater may advertise : ? HOT SPOTS is definitely a good picture ' ( Daily Post ) . " Thus the original review is falsified by having seven words plucked out of their context . These are examples of symbol contexts . But let us take an everyday situation ( in a peacetime world ) . An Australian family deeply interested in cricket is follow- // ing a series of test matches , of which so far Australia and England have won two each . Father comes in one evening and announces that " Bradman has broken a finger . " The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than their five words say . Their meaning depends upon a context which is not a verbal one but a context of happenings in which Don Bradman has played an important part , and a context of hopes and calculations and fears in the minds of the members of this Australian family . In our experiment the context consists mainly of the introductory paragraphs . Without this context , each version-would have to be more detailed and explicit , and the two versions might have to use more words in common . As it is , the context gives information which is taken for granted . Half the battle in understanding what anybody is saying consists in making a mental note of the things he is taking for granted . Three quarters of our conversation would sound " haywire " if it were considered apart from its context . One remembers from 1930 the placards ? sHE 's THERE ! ? of an evening newspaper which were rushed along the London streets during the time when everybody was wondering whether the aviatress Amy Johnson would get to Australia . In ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a written introductory paragraph . A context is what makes one able to tell a story to a friend ( who , in our common-sense idiom , " talks the same language " ) in fewer words than one could to a stranger . // We never " tell all . " Indeed , the best speaker or writer is often the man who can leave most out and get a few words to do a lot of work . Also , no word is indispensable . For any particular job any word can be passed up and its whole function performed by another word , or other words , and it never will be missed . This assertion will be elaborated upon in the next chapter , but the mere fact that there can be such a thing as a dictionary is sufficient proof of its truth . The reader can try another experiment , if he will get a piece of paper and on it jot down a  --  b  --  c  --  twice . Reading through the paragraph which follows , his first task is to write down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the blanks . " Dr. Benson was already in the workroom , and had sat down to wait on a toolbox , with his back against the  - -  of a high bench . He felt relieved when he saw , limping through the door , relying heavily on the  --  of his chauffeur , the old gentleman to whose  --  most of the town's. charities owed their existence . " Secondly , use three different words . If the reader did this little test and feels satisfied with his results , the chances are that he got the right words ; but the point is that , as far as effective communication is concerned , no one word here is the right word because there is no such thing . One word does the job as well as the other . Any preference we may happen to show is due to extra intentions which restrict our choices . Here , // for example , we might want to write with a pleasing literary style , and avoid repeating the same word ? or , on the other hand , we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " support . " As far as simply " referring " to the referent is concerned , the choice is fiftyfifty . Indeed , as we see , the context here is strong enough to permit most of us to catch on with the use of no words at all . In semantics , besides accepting the importance of contexts , we must have definite ideas about their nature . Nothing much is settled by burbling : " Of course , one always has to consider the context . " The word should be used carefully , because , as we have seen , there are three distinct types of context . One way of clarifying the distinction is for the reader to think of the Triangle of Reference . At the foot of the symbol leg let us picture a book ? a geography textbook of Australia , let us say . This book represents a symbol context . At the top of the Triangle is the head of a student , wearing a mortarboard . If he is a Cambridge ( England ) undergraduate , the tassel will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flat edge ; but this is not a fact on which our argument depends . The diagram stands for the student 's thoughts about Australia ; in general terms , for a psychological context . Finally , at the referent corner , is a map of Australia , a rather kidney-shaped mass of land which looks as if a great giant had chopped out the Gulf of Carpentaria from its top with a rectangular spade , and as if the Great // Australian Bight at the bottom had been made by the teeth of a still larger giant . This diagram represents all the objective facts about Australia , known and un-known . It is a physical context . The three types of con-text to be distinguished , as we have shown , are physical , psychological , and symbolic . There is no need to stop at Australia ? we can widen our range to the limit . Each of us has his own machinery of words and his own ways of manipulating it . All the words you or I have ever met can be considered as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart from the networks of other people . When we talk or write , we share that bit of our network with those who hear or read us ; otherwise there could be no such thing as communication . But we ought to feel sobered when we consider the differences between our individual networks . There are as many different symbol contexts as there are different persons in the world : probably at present about two thousand millions of existing symbol contexts . A similar story can be told of our thoughts . Every in-dividual puts together his experiences with words and his experiences with objects and weaves them into an outlook , a way of thinking ? what the Germans call a Weltanschauung . There are two thousand millions of different psychological contexts in the world . Finally , there is the total context of existing things . This embraces all referents , whether symbolized or not , whether known or unknown . All animals , vegetables , // and minerals , biology 's organs in their organisms , literature 's writers in their milieus , sociology 's lawbreakers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , different sections of which are studied by the different sciences . The world has only one physical context . For us , the practical problem is to remember which of these three contexts we are thinking about . The discussion immediately above has inflated all three beyond their customary size : the contexts we are normally interested in are bits of contexts , and it is to such bits that the word will hereafter be applied again . We must constantly bear in mind the way symbol , psychological , and physical contexts overlap one another . One can not know a word without having thought about it ; thus , all of our symbols are parts of psychological contexts . In the physical world , every referent known to us or anyone else has contributed to a psychological context ? in most cases , to thousands of psychological contexts . So psychological contexts link up too with physical contexts ; or , to put it another way , psychological and physical contexts combine to form wider physical contexts ? for all contexts are contained within physical contexts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving all the facts , of how Mr. Wells wrote his Outline of History . We might , if we were stupid enough , decide to do three neat little essays : on Mr. Wells 's words , Mr. Wells 's mind , and Mr. Wells 's referents . But our real task // would be to consider the interconnections between those three types of context . The words he uses have a history of their own , which thousands of books have not finished telling . The history of how Mr. Wells got to know all the words he used in his Outline would be a long and complicated story , involving his experiences with thoughts and things as well as with words . Even chickens and caterpillars carry wherever they go traces from past contexts with which they have been concerned ; how much more complex must such traces be in a Mr. Wells . They affect his thoughts as well as his words , so that his thoughts are results of all his past contacts with words , thoughts , and things . As for the referents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contexts with workers and fighters and discoverers of old . Writers before him had dealt with these facts , interpreting and misinterpreting them . Mr. Wells 's authorities and sources , oral and written , would all need to be brought into our account . So the complete story of Mr. Wells and his book becomes a universal history , only a few strands of which are hinted at in the Outline itself . The Receding Referent One last peculiarity , inherent in the way we think , causes trouble when we concentrate our attention on a physical context or on a referent . When we try to find a physical context , it eludes us . This chapter has spoken of a physical context as if it were so much matter . But // is it ? Really , a physical context is composed only of the relevant physical factors , and who or what decides what is relevant but the organism ? Let us start afresh for the moment , and make sure we can clearly see the difference between : 1 . The physical context that is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 2 . Those parts of the physical context ( 1 ) that are noticed by the organism . 3 . The psychological context . Considering the properties that make up a context , the physical context in any given example will be ( 2 ) . But we have to speak of ( 2 ) as if it were ( 1 ) ; otherwise it merges into ( 3 ) 1 Referents behave in the same way ; we can never catch them by sidling after them inch by inch . Achilles may have felt certain that he could catch a tortoise , but with mathematics the way it was in his day he was totally powerless to prove it . So our linguistic machinery balks at the task of proving that the most physical of referents " exists . " I look across the room and see a chair , and formulate this situation in terms of the Triangle of Reference : " chair , " symbol ; my chair , thought ; the chair , referent .
