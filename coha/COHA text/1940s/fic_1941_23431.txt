ONE THOUGHT OF PITY A STORY BY HOWARD SPRING mitn advertisement said that the house I stood in three acres of ground , that the aspect was southerly , and that a trout stream flowed through the little estate . " Stables converted into garage ; gardener 's lodge ; uninterrupted views of southern slopes of Dartmoor ; low rates ; price moderate . " It was the sort of thing I was after and I was going to take a look at it . At fifty I had had enough of cities . A small home in the country with peace to write  --  that was what I wanted now . Already I could hear the trout stream tinkling in the summer and brawling in the winter through my own three acres . Already I sat on the warm outcropping rock of a for and looked at the autumn heather and bracken burning away in my uninterrupted view of the southern slopes of Dartmoor . But now it was not autumn ; it was spring ; and the car purred through Moretonhampstead , eagerly taking the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a day of blue and white , of singing larks , of moorland ponies running wild with tails streaming in the wind : everything full of a great uprush of life and hope and liberty . Even Princetown was unable to cast a shadow on that blithe day  --  Princetown that is no town at all , but a gray ugly huddle of a village , with the gray ugly huddle of the convict prison lying alongside it . Even then , when I stopped to have petrol put into the car I did notthink of Coxon  --  did not think of anything at all but the three acres and the trout stream , the loveliness of the day and the loveliness of the liberty my success had given me . And then I saw Coxon . There were six of them shuffling along the road , wearing the drab ill-fitting garments of the prison . They were short and tall and stout and thin , but they were all alike , gray-faced and hopeless-looking , their eyes in the dust , their feet going with the shamble of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warder with a rifle had them in charge . The abundant dark hair that Coxon had always worn was scythed away to a harsh stubble ; his firm handsome face had become slack and deeply lined . He did not see me  --  the fool who had brought him there with one thought of pity . I was granted that mercy . When the doomed file had passed within the prison gates I reversed the car and drove back the way I had come . The southern slopes of Dartmoor were no longer a prospect I wanted at my front windows . Coxon and I had done so much together . He had come to our house to play when we were boys , and one day we had looked through the fence into the Maitlands ' garden next door , and there was Phoebe Maitland sitting in a deck chair with her Iong red hair streaming down behind it . Through a gap in the fence we could grab her hair , and we both wanted to do that , but we knew that if one grabbed , Phoebe would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expected of her , and therefore one of us would be disappointed of his grab . So we decided to grab together and did so , and we pulled Phoebe 's hair right through the gap in the fence ; and Coxon said , " Give me those shears , George . NI snip it all off . " And at that Phoebe screamed so much that her mother came running out and we bolted . We went to the Manchester Grammar School together , and Phoebe Maitland went to the Girls ' High School . He and I often followed her home ; for the Maitlands , the Coxons , and my people lived in three adjoining houses . Sometimes she would turn on us and tell us to clear off . She had even then a sharp , virulent tongue . We made , Coxon and T , one of those boys ' vows that we would remain friends for life . It looked as though we were going to do it . We were clerks together in a Manchester cotton warehouse , and when I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon followed into the same firm 's employment . We were both writing at that time to Phoebe Maitland , both , as it were , still simultaneously grabbing at her alluring red hair ; and when Coxon married her that made no difference to our friendship . They were not well off . How could they be , with him earning a clerk 's wages at International Utilities ? They were glad enough to have me living with them at their little house in Harrow . Coxon and I traveled to and from the City together . Then came the war to end war , and he and I joined the Manchester Regiment . We were in the same battalion all through , and he did better than I did . He got his captaincy and I was never more than a second lieutenant . He needed the extra pay , for Phoebe was expecting a child when the War started , and when it finished there were two more . From that point Coxon 's way and mine began to diverge . Of course our common experience in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing should separate us . But life does n't work out the way you swear it 's going to . I lodged with them again after the War , but with three children in the house it was n't the same thing . And soon they did n't need the money I was paying . Coxon had always been brilliant at mathematics and he began to go ahead at International Utilities . He caught the eye of Mr. Henshaw , who was International Utilities , if anyone was , and Mr. Henshaw , over a dinner table , caught the eye of Phoebe , who had grown into a very beautiful woman ; and the less I say about all this the better . Anyway , Coxon went ahead and I did n't . Phoebe insisted on taking a larger house , which I did not share ; and as Coxon 's salary rose bit by bit Phoebe always knew bit by bit how to spend it . Well , there was I , still sitting with the clerks in the general office while Coxon already had his own room with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . We continued to take lunch together unless some more important person wanted to lunch with him ; but that was about all we saw of each other . He played golf at week-ends with people who were worth playing golf with , and Phoebe had tennis parties on her own lawn , and bridge parties in the winter . Now a hand at solo is all I care for in the way of cards , and I have always lived happily without golf or tennis . I did once do my best at one of Phoebe 's bridge parties , but when I said " Pass " she raised her eyebrows , patted that hair which the years and a good hairdresser had made truly wonderful , and said " No bid ? " I understood that I had used a low solo whist expression , and I did n't go again . Coxon and I did n't travel to work together now , because I had gone to live on the other side of the town  --  right out in Essex , in a village where modern villas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a bed-sitting room over a corn merchant 's shop , and it was there , five years after the War ended , with my window open on the elms standing round a little lake , that I spent every night of the summer writing " Old Soldiers Never Die . " f shall not say any more about that . I do n't suppose " Old Soldiers Never Die " will be seen on a stage again , but I need not tell you of its effect at that time . It was the most successful of all war plays : so successful that I was stunned  --  by the uproar it made . I was slow in realizing that the shackles of the workaday world had fallen from me . Then I went to Paris and Vienna and Prague , to New York and Hollywood . I never had another success , but I found that one success of such dimensions enabled me to go on earning a good deal of money with very little effort . For fifteen years I lived a carefree life , and then found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for good . In all those years I had not seen Coxon . For ten years I had not written to him or he to me . Onc evening when the boulevards were gay with lights shining on the young green of leaves , he walked right up to the cafe table where I sat , saw me , and swiftly pulled his felt hat down over his eyes . He made then as though to walk away , but I had recognized him and started up , grasping his arm . " Why , Coxon ! " I cried . He sat in one of the painted iron chairs alongside mine . At first I thought he looked splendid . His long dark hair was as glossy and abundant as ever . His face seemed even stronger and more handsome than when I had last known him . He was well dressed . At that time he would be about fifty years old . I ordered him a drink and scrutinized him carefully . He did n't come out of the examination too well . Some of the deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength . The hand which took up the glass trembled a little . When he put the glass down it made a tiny clatter on the iron table . Coxon kept his hatpulled over his eyes . From time to time he looked about him more with apprehension than with interest . I noticed all these trifles , and they built up into something I did n't like . We said over and over again , " What a surprise ! Fancy  --  after all these years ! Well , to run into each other like that ! " but we did n't seem to get ahead with any real conversation , Added to everything else , Coxon was a little morose . " Are you often in Paris , Coxon ? " I asked him . No , he said . He hardly knew the place . " How long are you staying ? " He did n't know . He might push off to-morrow  --  possibly to Marseilles . You see , we were n't getting on . He twirled his little glass and did not look at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How 's Phoebe ? " This time he was at least emphatic . " Damn and blast Phoebe ! " he said and looked me full in the face . I saw that he was now speaking from the heart . " Coxon , " I said , " what 's the matter ? Can I help you ? " I stretched my hand across the table and laid it on his arm . Then suddenly his face was twisted with an extraordinary contortion . He was trying to prevent himself from crying . This was terrible . I quickly paid the bill and said , " Look , I 've got a flat with a spare bed . Come and spend the night with me . " " All right , " he said . " But we 'll have to go and pick up my bag . " We got into a taxi and he gave the name of a hotel on the Quai Voltaire . When we got there he said : " George , you go in and get my bag . It 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay the bill . I 'll settle with you later . Say it 's Mr. Henderson 's bill . " , " Henderson ? " " Yes . And look . You need n't tell them where we 're going to . " I was standing on the pavement , talking to him through the open window of the taxi . " Why , what 's it all about , Coxon ? " I asked , uneasy to my very marrow , but trying to laugh . " You been robbing the till at International Utilities ? " " Yes , " said Coxon . I crossed the pavement to the hotel door on legs that trembled . I had never really liked that flat in Paris . It was all nouveau art and pretentious frippery . Now there was at least one piece of tremendous reality in it . Coxon , with the half light of a shaded lamp making his face look old and careworn , was asking whether he could stay there long enough to grow a beard . My recollection of that night is like the recollection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror . Individual phrases that Coxon uttered stand out clear in my memory : the key ideas round which his tragedy was built up . " Yes . It was a very nice house so far as it went . But it went too far . " This was not the house where , long ago , I had tried at a bridge party to keep pace with Phoebe 's gentility . She had soon grown out of that little place , and out of another twice its size . The nice house that Coxon was now referring to was one they had moved into ten years ago . It was in Buckinghamshire , on the Chiltern slopes , a small manorhouse in about five acres of ground . Small , that is , as manorhouses go , but much bigger than anything Coxon needed . It ran him into three indoor servants , a gardener , an undcrgardcncr , a gardener 's boy , and a chauffeur for the Rolls Royce car . Coxon could afford all this , for his career at International Utilities had been even more successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Phoebe took the manorhouse to celebrate the day when Coxon achieved an almost undivided control of the company 's finances . He could afford it  --  if he spent every shilling he was earning  --  because it was n't only the house ; it was also the children . " They were all like her . " That was another of the phrases that stuck forever in my memory , that recurred when I saw Coxon shuffling through the prisongates , when I turned the car and drove back to Moretonhampstead , wondering what had chiefly brought Coxon where he was : Phoebe Maitland and those children who were just like her , or my own misguided pity . The children ate up all the money that was left over from Phoebe and the establishment . They were all boys . Public school ... university . " The youngest is twenty-one , " said Coxon bitterly . " Not one of them has ever earned a penny . " I had not interrupted Coxon much . Once he started , he was glad to run on , to get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , " I said now , " could n't you have stopped it ? Could n't you have put your foot down ? " " Just you remember , " said Coxon , " all this was beginning fifteen years ago . Phoebe 's still an attractive woman . What she was then you know very well . She had ways and means . Are you still a bachelor ? " I said that I was . " Very well , then , " Coxon commented bitterly , " you do n't know what you 're talking about . You stay a bachelor , G eorge . " He remained silent for a while , his elbows on his knees , his face in his hands . " I could see nothing but ruin for us all in the long run , " he said . " I did n't feel I owed them much . Very well , then . I began to make provision for myself . " Coxon had been making provision for himself for five years . I have n't given you any idea of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was an immense concern . Its financial arrangements were full of subtle and complicated ramifications ; its profits were never less than a million pounds a year . At the heart of that web of money , with all its meshes under his fingers , it would have been strange if a man of Coxon 's financial skill had not been able to make provision for himself . There was something almost of pride in the way he looked at me . " Oh , no ; it was n't difficult , George , " he said . " The thing is to know when to stop , when the moment has come to clear out . They 'll never get to the bottom of it . I doubt if they 'll so much as suspect it . It 's all tied up in one or two countries in a way they 'll never tumble to . " For the first time I began to be interested in the financial side of Coxon 's crime . " How much ? " I asked . " Oh , about fifty thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bubble into the air of the flat . If it had been a cannon-ball it could not have bowled me over more completely . Again I detected that sense of pride in the effect he had created . " Then there was just a matter of five hundred pounds to put them off the track , " he said . The five hundred pounds seemed to Coxon , as he sat in his room at International Utilities , the master-stroke of the whole matter . It would be a large enough sum to account for his disappearance , and while they were puzzling that out there was a chance that they would not think of anything else . Not that they would find anything else . It was a hundred to one against . But he was not taking even that one chance . The five hundred pounds was his insurance against it . " What a fool ! To wreck such a career for five hundred ! " For a year he had been betting rather heavily  --  he who had never bet in his life before , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received , as he had hoped to do , some letters from bookmakers , vaguely threatening . He now put them in a private drawer of his desk and locked it . They would force that drawer all right . They would find in it too some heavy bills that Phoebe had run up and that he had deferred paying till most of them were accompanied by letters asking for prompt settlement . Let them weigh it all up . " Poor old Coxon ! He always lived to the top of his income . And that wife ! Everyone knows she ran him in for a pretty penny . And then the poor fool tried to get straight by gambling . Let that be a lesson to you , my lad . It always sinks you deeper in the long run . But five hundred pounds ! To cut and run on that ! " He smiled . He could see them shaking their heads over his folly . He got up and walked to the window . He heard the night watchman on his rounds passing the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last light of what had been a beautiful spring day was fading in a twilight that looked melancholy there in the city . Time to have done . Time to take the last walk through that impressive door which he had entered so long ago with George Heppinstall  --  when they were both raw youths from Manchester . His new suitcase with the new initials " H.H. " was waiting for him at Victoria station , ready-packed with new things  --  clothes with the monogram " H.H. " upon them , brushes with the monogram " H.H. " stamped in the back , a few books with " Hilary Henderson " written on the fly-leaves . Nothing to do now but go . He left the safe open , with a few bank notes lying outside it , to give the impression of a confused snatch , precipitate haste . He did not take a taxi . There was no sense in providing a witness to his destination . He walked down Black-friars Street to the Embankment , pleased that he felt no stress of excitement , that he had thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had thought of everything except the ragged heap of misery that sidled up to him as he leaned for a moment against the Embankment wall . The man carried a tray of studs and matches and other small articles as a cover for his begging . He leaned on the wall alongside Coxon and , looking at him sideways , Coxon saw that a few medals swung from his chest , and that in the side of a battered greasy hat he wore the badge of the Manchester Regiment . The sight of that badge drove Coxon 's mind sharply back to the days when he and Heppinstall had been comrades , when Phoebe was young and beautiful and their love was new and , having nothing , they yet seemed to have all things . " Gawd strewth , guvnor , I 'm starving . Gawd strewth I am . Not ' ad a solid meal for three days . Three kids , guvnor , and a missus . " He pulled open the overcoat which was nothing but a dirty tattered patchwork , and shamelessly exposed his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , guvnor  --  no clo'es , no food . " It was a whine Coxon had heard often enough , and it had never much moved him . " 1 do n't know that I was moved then , George , " he said , " or whether it was sheer damn ' bravado  --  that impulse to play the fairy godmother , to change someone 's whole outlook with a wave of the wand . " Whatever it was , he said suddenly : " Could you do with a fiver ? " " Do n't kid a bloke , guvnor . Blimey , if you said five bob I 'd fed like Rocker-feller . " " I said five pounds , and I mean , " Coxon added , the game getting hold of him , " five pounds each . " They were standing in an alcove where the Embankment looped in a little on the river . No one shared their secrecy . The man crept nearer to Coxon , his eyes glittering , his voice husky , almost threatening as he asked : " Wotcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed and counted the five pound notes on to the fellow 's dirty tray . " One for you , " he said . " One for the missus . And one  --  two  --  three for the kids . " The man said nothing . He stood there open-mouthed , gazing at the thin crinkly sheets with their magic black inscriptions . Coxon walked on to Victoria . " Coxon , " I said , " have another drink . " I thought he 'd need it , so horrible was the idea that had come into my head . It was now one o'clock in the morning . We had talked ourselves hoarse . I poured him the drink and asked , " Was all your five hundred in fivers ? " MAGAZINE " Most of it , " he said . " I took good care to change ' em into French notes at the bureau de change at Victoria . I did n't want them in my pocket . The rest was pound and ten shilling notes that could n't be traced . " " Traced ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the fivers . " Even now he did n't sec what I was getting at . " Poor devil ! " I said , half to myself . Then suddenly Coxon saw it , and started to his feet , white to the gills . " Damn and blast the man , " he cried excitedly . " Let him take his chance . I 'm not going to wreck everything for him  --  five years ' work , scheming down to the last detail . He was just a common sponger , pitching the tale . Why should I have mercy on him ? Who 's ever had mercy on me ? " I let him run on . He was full of self-pity , striding about the room , talking at the top of his voice . " Tell me that , Heppinstall , " he demanded . " Who ever had pity on me ? Who cared whether I lived or died ? Even you , " he said , turning on me bitterly , " even you have n't cared a damn . For fifteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't mind what Coxon had to say about me . I stuck to my point . " As soon as that poor devil tries to change one of those notes he 's for it . They 'll fit him in as an accomplice somehow . Twenty-five pounds from a perfect stranger ! What a story ! What a hope he has ! " Coxon walked up and down . " Pity ! " he exclaimed . " I hate the name of it . It was n't pity made me give him the money . It was just swank . And he 'll get no pity from me now . " I went to bed . Coxon would n't do so . He kept his clothes on and slept on the couch . In the morning he came into my room and waked me . " George , " he said , " I 'm going to give myself up . " He was at first perfectly composed . He had bathed and shaved and looked a comfortable , prosperous man . But sud-denly all this fa  --  ade crumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face in the bedclothes and wept . " It was all so perfect , " he said , " not a flaw in it , I tell you . No one could have touched me . And now you  --  you with your damned pity Why in hell did I have to meet you after all these years ? " . It was my turn now to thrust pity aside . It seemed incredible that Coxon should be going back , because of me , to all the torment of a public exposure , to final and unutterable ruin : I urged him to forget all I had said , to do as he had planned , to use me in any way he liked . I even thought of what seemed to me a brilliant way of saving them both ? him and this paltry beggar who had wrecked his schemes . " Look , Coxon , " I said , " you do this . You write a letter telling exactly what happened . It will corroborate what this feller says . They 'll know your writing . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me and I 'll post it after you 're gone  --  a month after  --  any time you like . Even if this chap 's done a few weeks in jail , what matter ? I do n't suppose it 'll be the first time . They 'll have to let him out as soon as your letter arrives . I 'll post the letter wherever you say  --  Berlin , Rome , Zurich ? my time 's my own . Let me do this for you , Coxon . Look at it in a reasonable light . " " Reasonable ? " said Coxon ; who was now again quite calm . " Do you call that reasonable ? Suppose it was Martin ? " And on that I could not shake him . " Suppose it was Martin ? " That was the great thought that had come to him during the night and that nothing could dissipate . I remembered how Sergeant Martin , himself shot through the shoulder , had brought Coxon in from no-man's-land , and we both knew that Martin had gone down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great anonymous slough of unemployment and misery . It was the remotest chance in the world , a chance that anyone but a fool would put aside , I now argued with Coxon . But he was not to be moved . " Suppose it was Martin ? " I saw how it was . That shuffling scarecrow on the Embankment had become a symbol with him : if not our Martin , then somebody 's Martin , a human being with a man 's right to justice . There are moments when I feel proud of Coxon  --  proud of him despite all that was said by the old moralist in ermine and red flannel  --  because in the very thick of his crime Coxon thought of this elementary right , which is so little thought of by so many of our governors and betters . I traveled with him from the Gare du Nord as far as Calais . In my mind now is the bitter contrast of his tall upright figure ascending the gangway and the shambling convict I saw outside the prison gate . Between those times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he got back became public property during the trial . He slept in a London hotel that night and went to the offices of International Utilities first thing the next morning . He walked straight into Mr. Henshaw 's room . " Good morning , Henshaw : I do n't suppose you expected to see me again ? " " Ah , Coxon ! Good morning . Sit down . " Henshaw , all smiling urbanity , offered a cigar which Cason took and which Henshaw lighted for him . " No . Certainly , we thought we 'd seen the last of you . But we 're delighted to have you back . Now you 're both accounted for  --  you and your verminous accomplice . " " So the police have got him already ? " " Oh , yes . That was easy . But you , Coxon  --  you 're another matter . Frankly , I thought we 'd never see you again . " " You would n't have , " said Coxon , " if that man had been what you call him  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to explain that . That 's what I 'm here for . " , " Perhaps , " said Henshaw , " you 'd better explain in writing . Here , make yourself comfortable , and take your time . "
