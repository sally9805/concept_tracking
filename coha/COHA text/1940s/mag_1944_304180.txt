Valentim Boucas , amiable financial adviser to President Getulio Vargas , was in Washington last week . He concluded an agreement which raised the price of wild Amazon rubber and shifted to the Brazilians the responsibility for producing it ( TIME , Feb. 28 ) . Also on his mind was the dubious postwar future of Amazon rubber . <P> The present price of high-grade Brazilian rubber is 60 a lb. , which is not far above the cost of gathering it from the scattered wild trees of the jungle . Far Eastern plantation rubber is much cheaper . Synthetic rubber may eventually prove cheaper still . Apparently the only hope for Brazil 's war-built wild rubber industry is some sort of quota agreement with the U.S. <P> Forced Draught . Brazil has other worries . Her whole economy has been blown to white heat by the forced draught of war . Long dependent on raw material exports , and plagued by overproduction , Brazilians know that their wartime prosperity is largely a result of cooperation with the U.S. They hope that this cooperation will continue . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " At first , the war brought only disaster to Brazil. * U-boats and the shipping shortage choked off exports ; coffee piled up in Brazilian ports . But the tide soon turned . The U.S. Commodity Corporation underwrote the unshippable coffee . U.S. naval and air forces fought the U-boats , spent money and gave some employment . <P> U.S. war industries screamed for Brazilian raw materials , many of them obtainable nowhere else . Down from the States came a swarm of experts and near-experts to advise and plan and buy . So many arrived in the fall of 1942 that Brazilians called them " paraquedistas " ( paratroopers ) . Not all were well chosen . At first they were new to the country , poorly coordinated , confused by Washington rivalries . But they gradually got together under the leadership of Ambassador Jefferson Caffery , did their big job fairly well . The only bad mess was the wild rubber program in the Amazon Valley , where Americans did not take proper advantage of native experience . <P> Brazil 's strategic raw materials ( mica , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tantalum ) still have an insatiable market at excellent prices . Since foreign manufactures are hard to get , Brazilian factories have most of the domestic market to themselves . New industries have sprung up , old industries have expanded . A big gainer : the textile industry . <P> Native capital is abundant , adventuresome . When Panair do Brazil , subsidiary of Pan American Airways , put a new issue of stock on sale in Sao Paulo , hundreds of air-minded Brazilians stood all night in the street waiting to buy the certificates . <P> Biggest industrial venture is the steel mill at Volta Redonda in the State of Rio de Janeiro . Partly financed by a $45,000,000 Export-Import Bank credit for buying U.S equipment , it will process ore from the enormous , high-grade deposits at Itabra in the State of Minas Geraes . Eventually , Volta Redonda should supply Brazil with a good part of the steel which must now be imported . U.S. help in this project has won a lot of good will .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
