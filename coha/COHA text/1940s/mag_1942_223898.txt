Beat the Band ( music by Johnny Green ; book by George Marion Jr . &; George Abbott ; produced by Abbott ) is a sort of bouncing and stentorian corpse . Always long on pep , Producer Abbott ( Too Many Girls , Best Foot Forward ) has this time loosed a regular stage blitz , with everyone in the cast seeming to chase a fire , and most of the dances doing everything but start one . With a nod from the plot Abbott has worked a blaring swing band , all traps and trumpets , into the proceedings . Even the costumes are loud as a St. Patrick 's Day tie . <P> But for once the Abbott zip has outsmarted itself . When it makes with the feet , Beat the Band is enjoyable , but the general effect of the show is one of high-pressuring rather than high spirits . It suffers from too many vitamins and not enough food . The book , which tells of an explosive bandleader ( Jack Whiting ) who impersonates the godfather of a young thing ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is silly , dull , and slower than a tightwad reaching for the check . The gags are frightful . The lyrics are forced . Composer Green ( Body &; Soul , I 'm Yours ) has turned out one or two lusty tunes , and gone to town with Steam Is on the Beam , but his score is on the whole unexciting . Finally , though pert , attractive Ingnue Miller is a promising newcomer to Broadway theater , the cast contains none of those accomplished showmen who can amiably bully the audience into thinking that pink is green . <P> * An exeption is Fleet Air Arm 's Laurence Olivier , whose policy is " the war or the theater , but not both . "
