RETROSPECT OF WESTERN TRAVEL-Harrief Martineau- Harper ( 2 vols. , $4 ) . <P> To celebrate their first 125 years of publishing Harper &; Bros , this week reissued these two neatly bound and boxed volumes by an Englishwoman , whose name , once known to all U.S. literates , has been all but forgotten . Harriet Martineau visited the U.S. only 20 years after the bitter War of 1812 , first published in 1838 this account of what she saw . But few books could be more timely . Reason : few Britons have ever seen the U.S. so clearly or reported what they saw with such understanding and fairness . But Harriet Martineau 's book is important in another way . It looks , through the author 's fresh and enthusiastic eyes , on an America that was itself fresh and enthusiastic , and leads to a thoughtful stocktaking of what America ( and Britain ) were and what they have become . <P> The 32-year-old spinster ( she was born lacking a sense of taste or smell ; became deaf in childhood ) first saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long line of the New Jersey coast , with distinguishable trees and white houses . " " I was taken by surprise , " she wrote , " by my own emotions . All that I had heard of the Pilgrim Fathers , of the old colonial days , of the great men of the Revolution , and of the busy , prosperous succeeding days stirred up my mind . . . . " <P> Last Hope . For the land at which Miss Martineau stared was not merely a country but one of the last best hopes of the world and by some British instinct of freedom she knew it . Europe was a prison and a charnel house . This was the land on which all men 's dreams of freedom had come to rest . It was one of the last unoccupied lands in the world . This land had fought for and established a revolutionary principle-political liberty . If that succeeded , the world 's weary history of successive tyrannies would change . If it failed , the bloody pattern of European and Asiatic history would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unoccupied Lebensraum . It was with these thoughts in mind that Spinster Martineau looked at the U.S. , 1834 . And she looked at it on a scale that would have horrified her fellow spinsters in England and a good many Americans . <P> Vast Land . Her energy and courage were extraordinary . She traveled thousands of miles by coach , bumped over " corduroy " roads , put up at strange cabins and hostels . She talked and listened to statesmen , slaves , Abolitionists , jailbirds , men , women &; children , in the East , West and South . From New Orleans she sailed up the Mississippi on the Henry Clay to Cincinnati . She was fascinated by the " sudden and overwhelming . . . perils of this extraordinary river " where " snags , " " planters , " and " sawyers " might " at any moment pierce the hull . " Along the huge river she saw hundreds of miles of cotton and sugar fields . " What vast materials of human happiness , " she wrote , " are placed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> When an Irishman confided that he " feared that the independence of the Americans made them feel themselves independent of God , " Harriet snapped : " This consequence of democratic government had not struck me before .
