txt Today the Second Annual Report of the President 's Council of Economic Advisers makes its appearance . The product of a year 's study of the American economy at work , this review might fairly be expected to deal with the actual events of that period  --  to indicate where the stresses and strains of the post-war boom were manifesting themselves , what the basic causes seemed to be , and what specific course of remedial or preventive action was called for . But the reader who looks for these things in the Report will be looking in vain . What he will find instead is a long , rambling essay in which the authors seem simply to be thinking aloud about what " maximum production " would be like in the kind of world they conceive to be ideal . The Report is the more disappointing because on occasions it walks right up to an issue of major importance , only to turn at that point and head off in another direction . For example , it declares early in its discussion that " the inadequacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been demonstrated " during the first year of operation of the Employment Act of 1946 . " For we were astonished to find , after the country had reached the idealized figure of sixty million jobs , that the volume of production still was disappointing . " Now here is a subject worthy of thorough exploration , since it goes to the very heart of the controversy surrounding the so-called Full Employment legislation . One of the basic arguments advanced by experienced economists here against a " Beveridge Plan " for America was that it confused the objective of full employment with the full utilization of the nation 's productive resources . They pointed to Russia as an example of the fact that a nation could have full employment ( though not of the workers ' choice ) and still not know the meaning of the term " high standard of living " in the American sense . Now , the Council ' tells us that a year 's experience has demonstrated conclusively the soundness of that argument . But it introduces no supporting evidence , though there is plenty available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It simply makes the assertion , and lets it lie there . The intrepid reader who plods on from that point will find that the report touches on innumerable problems and grapples with none . It repeats self-evident truths with the air of one discovering them for the first time , and piles platitude upon platitude . For example , it is replete with cryptic economic sermonettes such as these : " ' Maximum production ' implies that the scale of production at a given time shall be adjusted to a reasonably longtime perspective . " * * " The significant problem is to develop the psychological security which can flow only from a growing conviction that maximum production , employment and purchasing power can and will be maintained " * * * " Our enlarged productive powers permit us to supply a great number of cultivated wants which have grown through the years " * * * " Even with abundant purchasing power the execution of a bold design for maximum production depends upon getting as much insight as possible into consumers ' real desires and relative preferences , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the market . " For a brief moment , in the closing section , the authors of the Report make a gesture in the direction of one of the moot issues of the day . " Will our present economic problems of inflation and high living costs be solved , " they ask , " merely by production , more production and still more production ' ? " After getting off the rails and back on again two or three times the authors appear to have forgotten what their question was , for their conclusion is that " accelerated production * * * will not , alone , solve the problem of hot to maintain a maximum level of pro duction . " And true to now well-estab lished form , the authors , who seem ti have learned nothing about compara tive price behavior over the last year conclude with a hymn in praise of " fat prices , " having obviously in mind ad ministered prices , though . these hav been the most stable element in the entire price structure . At the risk of seeming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find i1 necessary to observe that the chid contribution of this Report of the President 's Council of Economic Advisers is that it provides us with an excellent example of how-a Report of the President 's Council of Economic Advisers should not be written .
