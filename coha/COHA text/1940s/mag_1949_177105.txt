THE PORTABLE SHERWOOD ANDERSON ( 631 pp. ) - edited by Horace Gregory - Viking ( $2 ) . <P> <P> One day in 1912 at the age of 36 , Paint Manufacturer Sherwood Anderson strode out of his office and told his secretary cryptically : " I have been wading in a long river and my feet are wet . " With that , he walked out of his factory in Elyria , Ohio , and down the railroad track . He never came back . <P> He went to Chicago and began to write of the things he found in " the long river " during his years as a stable boy , a factory worker , an ad writer , a maker of paints . In the next 29 years , up to his death in 1941 , Anderson wrote one book , Winesburg , Ohio , that seems sure to endure , seven novels that will probably not last so well , and many fine stories . <P> Twilight Whistles . In The Portable Sherwood Anderson , Viking has collected seven stories from Winesburg , Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 20 letters , some editorials and news stories , and six of his later short stories , including I 'm a Fool , The Egg , and the unforgettable A Meeting South . <P> In retrospect there seems no question that Anderson was a great writer and that Winesburg , Ohio is a great book . The private jokes that came into his later stories , the introduction of his friends into the stories , the lordly pronouncements on politics , the pose of being the simple smalltown wise man , unaffected and honest , and above all the air of regarding literature as the province of only a few choice spirits , make Anderson 's work in his later years seem superficial . But 30 years after publication , Winesburg still retains its quaint and distinctive flavor , and summons up as powerfully as ever the twilight scenes of a small Midwestern town , the shy and tremulous meetings , the sudden , revelations , the moments of exaltation or sadness that pass like the whistle of the train . <P> Haven for Innocents . Anderson wrote of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great generals or great statesmen . The laborious account in Poor White of Allie Mulberry , the village idiot who astonishes the townspeople by carving a ship and placing it in a bottle , is a bland parody of innumerable success stories . And the dreamlike progress of Hugh McVey from poor boy to great inventor has a fine native fancifulness . Anderson 's picture of Winesburg seemed to his early critics-and to some early admirers , who read and fled to Paris - to be one of a typical , unenlightened , provincial community . It now seems a hideout , not for lawbreakers , but for the innocent ; a haven for the excessively sensitive or the insufficiently practical ; a refuge for those who have been run out of town ( usually by mistake ) ; a tolerant , disinterested community of citizens whose lives were spent not bothering anyone and asking only to be left alone .
