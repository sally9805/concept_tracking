" The greatest ovation in my 50 years of concert going , " said Mrs. William Randolph Hearst Sr. Said Jeritza : " A rabbit could have scared me away . I went to the post like a race horse which wears blinders . My heart was going boom , boom , boom ! " <P> It had been nine years since Maria Jeritza had sung before a New York audience , but all the old magic was still there . The 3,000 who jampacked Carnegie Hall cheered as they never had before - and many of them had bravoed many an earlier Jeritza performance . As much as anything else , the audience applauded the 58-year-old soprano 's apparently in destructible beauty . In a silver-spangled white dress flown East by Hollywood 's Adrian , the golden-haired diva looked like the late Jean Harlow in her prime . And when she sang her program of high-powered arias in the grand manner , the greatest singer-actress of her day proved that she could still be almost as easy on the ear as on the eye . <P> Franz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born Mitzi Jedlicka , a name she glamorized after she became a Viennese prima donna . Emperor Franz Josef , who heard her at the Vienna Volksoper , commanded her to the Vienna Court Opera and gave her the Austrian Order of Knighthood , first class. * For ten years she was the operatic toast of Europe 's gayest capital . Her tall ( 5 ft. 7 in. ) figure was as trim as a dressmaker 's model , and as muscular as a middleweight champion . For her combined vocal and physical prowess Puccini named her his " greatest Tosca , " Strauss his " greatest Salome . " <P> In 1921 Jeritza hit the Metropolitan Opera like a tidal wave . She sang the Vissi d'arte aria from Tosca lying flat on her face , the Seguidilla from Carmen flat on her back . In The Girl of the Golden West she rode a bronco on stage , and as Thai 's she once celebrated her conversion to Christianity with a record high-jump that landed her in the hospital . All this musical whoopla endeared Jeritza to her public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lilli Lehmann : " If you 're a real artist you do n't have to lie down on your face to sing a big aria . " <P> J. P. Morgan 's Advice . In Salome , her most sensational European role , Jeritza literally cast off all seven veils . New Yorkers had to settle for less because the late John Pierpont Morgan , a Met backer , had Salome banished from the repertory at the advice of his pastor . This annoyed Jeritza into singing a concert version of the opera , which was at least wanton enough to give New Yorkers a vivid idea what they were missing . <P> She retired from the Met in 1932 , later divorced her Austrian baron , Leopold von Popper , and married Hollywood Producer Winfield R. Sheehan ( who died last July ) . During the war she quartered G.I.s in her castle near Salzburg , and turned her California ranch into a free convalescent home for wounded soldiers . Since a Carnegie Hall concert in 1937 , she has sung mostly on the West Coast .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
