At Fiumicino , the muddy waters of the Tiber merge with the blue Mediterranean . The town 's life seems as sluggish as the river , but beneath the apparent calm there is a deep , turbulent rift which sometimes whirls up like an assault of wind-whipped breakers . That rift is symbolized by the tablet in the city hall commemorating Garibaldi 's visit in 1849 ( after the Republicans had driven the Pope from Rome ) , and by the blue &; white statue of the Virgin Mary in the church . <P> Those who reverently place wreaths beneath Garibaldi 's memorial and those who kneel before the Virgin-many citizens do both-have long lived together in drowsy tolerance . But now , the heirs of Garibaldi are tainted with Marxism , the <P> Catholics are accused of Fascism . The bitter struggle that rends all Italy recently broke out , in miniature , at Fiumicino . It was known as the " Clock Fight . " <P> The Ravens &; the Foxes . Fiumicino 's clock had been shattered in the war . Since most townsmen had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing village must move according to the relentless schedule of modern time , repairing the clock was an urgent matter . So everyone agreed when strapping , round-faced Father Bernardoni called together all parties for a raffle . The united effort yielded 70,000 lire . Then dissension began . Father Bernardoni insisted that 6,000 lire be used for parish charity which could not be delayed " because we ca n't let people die of hunger to have a clock a few days sooner . " <P> Screamed tough , wiry Communist Leader Otello Barbi : " You cornacchiacce , you dirty black ravens , you always turn everything into an instrument of propaganda in your favor . You just want all poor to be forced to sign on to the parish list . " Salvatore Gallo , a stocky Christian Democrat , rose from his caf table in the square : " You volponaccio rosso , you sly red fox , you know very well that the parish helps all the poor . It 's only that you want the poor to be forced to come to you Communists . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think only of the people . " Gallo : " You miserable red fox , yes , you think of the people-you think of their blood-you want to drink their blood if they do n't happen to think like you . You want our clock to strike the hour for you alone . " <P> Soon two angry factions faced each other in the square . The coffee-house owners hastily cleared the tables . This gave watching Mayor Cavaliere Giovanni Marcovaldi , who is stone deaf , an inkling of what was going on . His paunch protruding majestically , he carried himself to the middle of the square like a ship in full sail and shouted : " Children , children , do n't let 's be children . You are citizens . If you have a disagreement , appoint a committee . Do n't make Fiumicino the laughing stock of the countryside . " <P> So the " Committee for the Distribution of Urgent Charity from the Clock Funds " was born . <P> " Helper of Virgins . " In the whitewashed committee room , whose unpainted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcovaldi declared : " I suggest that the differences be met halfway . Let 3,000 lire be given to church funds and 3,000 to municipal charity . "
