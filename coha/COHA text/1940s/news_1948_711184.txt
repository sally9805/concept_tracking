txt City employes  --  clerks , laborers , technical workers , accountants , lawyers , librarians , pavers  --  and their spokesmen pleaded with the Board of Estimate yesterday to provide a general $600 wage increase in the 1948-49 executive budget , which already stands at a i record $1,137,306,741 . In great detail they drew a dreary picture of thousands of city workers with wages below those prevailing in Federal service , in other cities and in private industry ; of many compelled to work at two jobs to support their families , others burdened with loans and garnishees ; of professional and skilled workers giving up pension rights for better-paying private jobs , and few trained recruits willing to take their places . They were united in their demand for the general wage increase , and many urged that the $650 cost-of-living bonuses received in recent years be made permanent wage increases . The Civil Service Forum , a major employe organization , proposed that the approximately $60,000,000 needed for the increase be financed by a transit fare increase . Other labor groups suggested more taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Administration would have $77,000,000 in the General Fund that is not included in th , k budget estimate of $401,000 , - 00u . At 5:30 P. M. , after a long succession of speakers , Michael J. Quill , international president of the Transport Workers Union , CIO , strode into the hearing room and for ten minutes harangued the board members , demanding a ten-cent fare to pay for a 30-cents-an-hour increase for city transit workers . He warned that unless the city gave assurance of the 30-cent increase for city transit workers , the 8,000 employes of three /xis companies would be compelled to strike , possibly this week-end . He said the private companies took the position that they would not raise wages unless the city did . A tie-up of the three companies ? New York City Omnibus , Third Avenue and Fifth Avenue , serving 3,000,000 passengers daily  --  would throw an intolerable burden on the subways and " stop its wheels , " making a strike of city transit workers unnecessary , he declared . " If there is a strike against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close the schools because riding on the subways will be a terrific danger to the children , " Mr. Quill said . He recalled that 100 persons had been killed in a subway wreck in Malbone Tunnel in Brooklyn during a " 10 per cent " subway strike in 1919 . He blamed Governor Dewey for the city 's financial plight in failing ' to grant greater - state aid . He derided the Greater New York CIO Council , which , while supporting the ** demand for the TWU and for a $600 general rise , has opposed a fare increase . " I plead with you to be bold about this thing , " he cried . " There is only one thing to do , use the fare bill Dewey threw at you and raise the fare . " There were boos and hissing from the crowd as he started to walk away . Turning to the board , he said : " Those who boo have the same mentality as those who write verses and telephone numbers on washroom walls . They do n't worry me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for a higher fare to finance it received strong support from E. L. Oliver , who had spoken earlier in behalf of the employes of the Queens and Staten Island bus lines , recently taken over by the city , who are members of the Amalgamated Association of Street , Electric Railway and Motor Coaches Employes of America , AFL . Mr. Oliver , of the Labor Bureau of the Middle West , Washington , closed his factual plea by declaring that a denial of an increase to transit workers of the city , whose wages lag far behind those of other cities , would make them Mr. Oliver said a wage increase for city and private bus employes in the city was impossible without a fare increase and that a wage increase was long overdue . While the Bureau of Labor Statistics budget for a family of four in New York City was $3,482 last February , the average annual earnings of city transit workers were $2,999 , short by $487 , he said . City truck desperate and easy prey for " the rabid , ranting demagogue type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1947 earned up to $1.80 an hour and averaged $1.40 , or 20 to 60 cents an hour more than a bus driver , classed as a skilled worker , he declared . Against the $1.20 an hour paid to , bus operators in New York , he said , last year Newark paid $1.30 ; Boston , $1.45 ; Chicago , $1.42 ; Seattle , $1.42 and now $1.50 , with many small cities paying $1.25 to $1.30 . New York is second only to Washington in the high cost of living , he continued , and is the highest wage center in the country , with its factory wage averaging $1.57 an hour , against a national $1.25 . Since 1941 , factory wages have increased 89 per cent in the country but New York transit wages have gone up only 38 to 40 per cent , he asserted . Cities Compared on Fares While New York 's fare has remained at 5 cents , it has gone up to 10 cents and higher in many cities , reaching 13 cents in Detroit . The average fare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of transportation in New York for the wage earner 's family was $46 ; in Chicago , $92 ; in Detroit , $106 ; Los Angeles , $71 , and in Washington , Cleveland , St. Louis , Baltimore , Seattle and Pittsburg , $85 . While representatives of employe unions presented masses of figures to show the plight of many city workers , a more affecting story was told by several trained technical employes . Bernard Eletz , a junior engineer in the office of the Manhattan Borough President , said that after twenty-four years his salary was 1$2,820 and that last winter , when he asked for money for winter clothes for an outside job , he was told there was none . Hugo Burns , technician and college graduate , said he used to get 50 per cent more than day laborers , but that now the lowest-paid day laborer on the jobs 1. e inspects gets more with two hours a week overtime than he does . From the Department of Finance , Herman Nass said many employes must hold two jobs to get by . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earning above $4,000 and that at least 60 per cent of the department 's employes had to have two jobs . Jack Bigel , representing the United Public Workers of America , CIO , presented a mass of tables , charts and statistics in a bitter , mocking mood . He charged that the Controller 's estimate of $401,000,000 for next year 's General Fund was a " great hoax " on the city 's workers because it underestimated the total by $77,000 , - 000 ? enough to provide pay increases for transit workers and other city employes . The average city salary has increased only 37 per cent since 1939 , including all bonuses , while the cost of living has gone up 67 per cent , he said , with the employes consequently receiving in real wages 30 per cent less than they earned nine years ago . In the large clerical classification , he said , 61 per cent earn less than $2,721 and 42 per cent less than $2,511 . Mr. Bigel reiterated the stand taken by the CIO earlier in opposing a higher fare as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Municipal Employes . AFL , said the $600 increase should be financed out of more taxes . Robert W. Brady , president of the Civil Service Forum , approved a higher fare to pay for the wage increase and said the cost-of-living bonuses should be made part of the permanent salary structure . Philip F. Brueck of the Civil Service Technical Guild , Civil Service Forum affiliate , also favored a fare increase . He said low city salaries were causing many of the city 's technical workers to seek other jobs ; once the best paid in the , country , they are now the poorest , I he said . The hearing continued without dinner recess until 9:10 P. M. , although Vincent R. Impellitteri , President of the City Council , who has presided for Mayor O'Dwyer , had announced Monday that there would be no night sessions . Fortynine speakers had been heard . The hearing will continue today at 10:30 A. M.
