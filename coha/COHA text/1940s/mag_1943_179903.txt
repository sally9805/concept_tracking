Dispatches from Allied headquarters revealed last week that Field Marshal Albert Kesselring has for some time been in supreme command of Axis forces in Tunisia . He is nicknamed Smiling Albert . If he was smiling last week , it was not because the news of his front was good . He and his men were cornered for fair . <P> The Axis forces had been driven into a great beachhead , about 100 miles long and 50 miles deep . Inside that beachhead , Albert Kesselring had 18 airfields , two cities with radiating roads , many good heights , some fixed fortifications , plenty of guns , and perhaps 175,000 men . He had Rommel , a proved master of battle , and Arnim , an aristocratic technician . And he had orders . <P> What use was he going to be able to make of all these things ? <P> His Terrain . The Axis beachhead in Tunisia is not wholly a fortress . Much of it is country which favors defense , but there are vulnerable spots . <P> The strongest areas lie on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northeast , and from Enfidaville to Djebel Sefsouf on the southwest ( see map ) , the mountain chains are steep , and provide a natural defense in depth . But in the center there are two areas where the fortress walls are weak . These are the broad valleys of Tunisia 's two main rivers : the Medjerda and the Miliana . " <P> The most logical threats to the fortress , therefore , lay from the directions of Med-jez-el-Bab and Pont du Fahs - and last week Field Marshal Kesselring could see that his adversaries were aware of the logic . They seemed to be clearing the way , patiently and fiercely , for drives up Tunisia 's center alleys . They spent the week clearing the outer walls of the alleys . French troops took Djebel Sefsouf on the one hand . British troops took Djebel el Ang on the other-a hill from which , on clear days , Tunis is visible 35 miles away . Kesselring , seeing the danger , took the hill back ; the Allies retook it and held . <P> Field Marshal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other commanding heights ( such as the beachhead 's highest hill , 4,250-ft . Djebel Zaghouan ) and then , when artillery and lookouts commanded the lesser places , to drive up the broad valleys . Doubtless he had concentrated in those valleys the things which General Eisenhower last week said had become , not just an obstacle , but a weapon in Tunisia-the land mine . On the hills Kesselring was deeply dug in , with plenty of the 81-mm. mortars which have always been a weapon but are especially an obstacle in Tunisia . <P> His Men . The exact number and condition of the Axis force in Tunisia is known , probably , to only a few Germans . The Allies announced that 30,000 prisoners had been captured in all Tunisia since the breaching of the Mareth Line , and unofficial estimates placed Axis battle casualties in the same period at 10,000 . The Italian Vittorio Veneto Division was said to have been virtually destroyed . These were losses for Kesselring , but not cataclysmic ones . His remaining force of approximately 175,000 was outnumbered by perhaps 2-to-1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no means broken . It contained crack Austrian and Italian mountain troops . <P> His Generals . The outside world already knew plenty about Field Marshal Erwin Rommel . Of Colonel General Jrgen von Arnim , much less was known .
