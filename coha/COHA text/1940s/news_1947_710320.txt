txt Yesterday , being A Great Day Easter Sunday , there on were on Fifth Avenue the Avenue many people who are not seen there as often as many other people . Those who are seen there every weekday , engaged in shopping and window shopping or just going to and fro afoot or in buses , were also there in considerable numbers . For Easter Sunday has been a great day on the Avenue for as long as any of us can remember . But perhaps some of Tempora you , whose beaten path Mutantur does not lie along New Et Nos ? York 's latter day Ladies ' Mile of Temptation , may have taken note of changes , even since last Easter . For example , just north of St. Patrick 's is a huge white , severely tailored block , with setbacks climbing aloft and carrying up into the sky until they keep company with the cathedral 's twin spires . This block is literally I wrapped around two little ornate numbers , relics of the days when Fifth Avenue fashionable shops were dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peTouching riod pieces are left as rePeriod minder of days when Pieces trade , in taking over a street famous for private palaces , made a point of preserving the eclectic elegances with which these palaces were distinguished . And no one of these other relics is so placed as to produce so sharp a contrast between the old and the new . The new building is a department store ; appropriately , one of the ornate little numbers encases an old-established jewelry shop . It may have happened , The Last too , that old-timers , who of an remember Fifth Avenue Old Order as a street of residences , noted  --  with a faint nostalgia , perhaps  --  that of all those residences only two are left in recognizable shape in the long reach from Madison Square to the Plaza . Both of them belong to the Age of Brownstone , going back to the time before the stoops were sheared off to widen the roadway and clear the sidewalks . Each of them has lost a frontal projection which gave dignity to the entrance for carriage company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The best preserved Pride and most impressive is of the solid mansion just the Avenue north of Rockefeller Center ? last survivor of an array of Vanderbilt houses , two blocks long , which were once the pride of the Avenue and the admiration of visitors from the inland parts of our country , and included among them the famous French ch  --  teau done in gray stone with extinguisher-topped towers by one of the most eminent architects of the school that made romantic styles , collected from all over Europe , the passionate pursuit of our new millionaires . The other is the dingy old house with mansard which stands on the northeast corner of Forty-seventh Street and used to be Jay Gould 's own . This is now an antique shop . The last of the Vanderbilt houses has been vacant since the death of General Cornelius and is marked for demolition . And , as assertion of the present and sign of the future , behind it in the middle of the long block which reaches back to what New Yorkers still prefer to call Sixth Avenue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center , following I the pattern of the rest , and to be called , they say , the Standard Oil Building . As for our scout Avenue on the prowl as usual as a Rural with his mind on the Road past  --  he was arrested at Forty-fourth Street , fortified by banks on three of the four corners , by sharply remembered pictures belonging to the first decade of this century . Where now one of these banks sits ensconced in a tall building was perched a place of refreshment called Ye Olde Willow Tree Cottage , a little wooden relic of days when Fifth Avenue was a country road . It was a good stand The More for cabbies , because It right across the street Changes ? was ' Delmonico 's and right across the Avenue was Sherry 's . At one or the other of these fashionable establishments were staged all the swank parties that did not go to the Waldorf , then still new , and parading down at Thirtyfourth Street the splendors that made its very name spell magic in the hinterland .

And the hansoms the young bloods preferred to what they called open-faced hacks invited select patronage , like the rest , with cries from the driver 's perch of " Keb , Sir . " However , when it rained hansoms were almost as hard to get as taxis are now .
