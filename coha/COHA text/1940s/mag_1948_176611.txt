The general sailed his flat-brimmed , Pershing-style khaki campaign hat on to a table , and sagged into a chintz-covered chair . Scowling across the parlor of his Managua , hilltop mansion , Nicaragua 's Dictator Anastasio ( " Tacho " ) Somoza grumbled : " I did everything I could to prevent what is coming , but there 's no way to keep the peace in Central America . For years Nicaragua 's Guardia National has stood like a Chinese wall in Central America , stopping trouble from going north and south . God knows I 'm a patient man , but there is nothing I can do now . The fireworks may start any time-maybe tomorrow . " <P> Tacho shifted his paunch and glowered at the is-foot stuffed alligator across the room . " The man responsible for this mess is Arevalo , up in Guatemala , " he growled . Tacho had heard that Arevalo was making jokes : " Let him talk about sending me flowers . I 'll send them over to him first . He plans to attack Honduras and Nicaragua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Costa Rica , Pro Socarrs of Cuba , and the Caribbean Communist tramps to destroy the peace of Central America . He is responsible for Central America 's coming war . " <P> Lend-Lease . It was not only Guatemala 's President Arevalo who was prodding Tacho Somoza last week . There was also a variegated group of political exiles , self-appointed enemies of tropical dictators , who called themselves the Caribbean Legion . Last spring they had flown at least 21 planeloads of arms from Guatemala right around Tacho 's Chinese wall and landed them in Costa Rica-where they helped General Jos Figueres install a government that bears no love for Somoza . <P> Since that victory , the Legion 's Dominican colonels and generals have been drilling 150 Nicaraguan youths on Figueres ' Rio Conejo farm , just outside San Jos . For Figueres ( who knows that Costa Rican counter-revolutionaries are also drilling on Tacho 's side of the border ) , the situation has been a little embarrassing . The Caribbean Legion and its friends have been looking for a way to get on with their business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they went to Guatemala City for strategy talks with Arvalo and Nicaraguan exile leaders . Last week they made their first move . Guatemalan-registered air transports began landing in Costa Rica to take aboard the Legion 's khaki-clad recruits . Once again , the airlift was on ; again it bypassed Tacho 's wall . This time the recruits and gear were headed for an encampment at Poptum , in the remote Guatemalan province of El Peten . Even though the move was no surprise this time , Tacho could do nothing about it : Arevalo 's air force was bigger than his . <P> Between Two Fires ? The airlift 's destination suggested that the Legion might be turning its attention for the moment to Honduras , where Dictator Tiburcio Carias had just won a carefully staged election . <P> But last week Tacho swore he would not be flanked again . " You think I 'm going to let them put me between two fires ? No ! The battle for Managua will be fought right over there in Tegucigalpa .
