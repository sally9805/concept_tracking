Sometimes even Russians go too far . Vadim Siniavsky did . Reviewing the Moscow Dynamo Club 's soccer invasion of Britain ( TIME , Nov. 26 ) , he beefed in Pioneer , a youth journal , that Britons had given the Russian champs a cool reception , had offered them a moldy , cobwebby barracks , had insisted on playing a game despite heavy fog . <P> For such unsportsmanlike reporting , Siniavsky last week got the sack . Also fired was the " careless editor " who passed the story . The London Daily Worker virtuously pointed the moral : " Soviet journalism , while hard-hitting , enjoys a splendid reputation for accuracy and clean , aboveboard reporting . . . the violators pay the price . . . . The world 's press would gain immensely in prestige if it were to take similar action against the daily purveyors of anti-Soviet slanders. "
