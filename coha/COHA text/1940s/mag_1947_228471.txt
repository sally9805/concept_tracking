Will U.S. resources stand the strain of rebuilding Europe under the Marshall Plan ? This week , Interior Secretary Julius ( " Cap " ) Krug , who had been designated by the President to find out , answered with a qualified but resounding Yes . <P> It would not be an easy job . Secretary Krug took " national resources " to mean manpower , technology and factories , as well as land , forests and minerals . Rich and bountiful as it is , the U.S. cornucopia is not limitless . Though annual exports on the projected scale of the Marshall Plan would amount to only 2% of the national capacity , they would be piled onto a taut , high-employment economy that was already near busting at the seams . <P> Because of this , some choices would have to be made . For instance , the U.S. would have to choose between shipping fertilizer abroad and using it at home to increase U.S. crops . It would have to decide between exporting coal cars for foreign mines or exporting more coal from the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; demand of key commodities . <P> Steel : the U.S. will not be able to produce enough to answer clamorous demands at home and abroad . Expansion of plant capacity will not help immediately ; building new furnaces would just use up more scarce steel . Steel will be in short supply at least through 1952 . <P> <P> Wheat : meeting export goals will depend on favorable weather , a conservation program . High production is no undue drain on fertility , but plowing up grazing lands for more acreage seriously increases the dangers of soil erosion . <P> Coal : the U.S. has plenty . The big problem is transportation . <P> Farm machinery : increased production will permit a 50% boost in exports next year without cutting into the domestic demand . <P> Cap Krug concluded : " From the standpoint of preserving both the national security and our standard of living , our economy in general is physically capable of providing the resource requirements of a considerable program of foreign aid . . . . But with or without a foreign-aid program , this country faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . for preserving the fertility of its soil and the future of its forests .. . . and for extending its efforts to discover and develop new sources of supply for many of its basic raw materials .
