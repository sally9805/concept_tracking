txt Once more the supposed leadership of the House of Representatives has proved sadly inadequate . After a febrile series of day , night and Sunday meetings , after repeated announcements from both sides of herculean efforts at compromise , the Democrats and Republicans of the Ways and Means Committee have emerged without a compromise . The House has voted for an Easter recess until May 3 . The pay-as-you-go proposal will not come up until the recess is over . As a practical matter this makes it highly improbable that a withholding tax can be put into effect by Ally 1 . The Treasury will lose millions of dollars . Money that should be turned over to the Government for the production of war weapons will be used instead to build up inflationary consumer demand . The mountain has labored and brought forth two deformed mice . There is little to choose between the Republican and Democratic plans . They are so nearly alike that failure to compromise becomes all the more astonishing . Neither plan rests on any clearcut principle . Both plans are tangled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both plans are complicated beyond all sense and reason . The problem that Congress was given to solve in this case was elementary . The House could have adopted the straight Ruml plan of basing taxes paid this year on 1943 income instead of 1942 income . It could have adopted the Carlson plan of basing such taxes on whichever income of the two years was higher . It could , with the fullest possible concession to political prejudice and demagogic argument , have canceled the tax due on , say , the first $5,000 of income of every taxpayer for 1942 , and then let taxes on any income beyond the first $5,000 continue to be paid the following year as they have always been . Any of these plans would have been reasonably fair . Any of them would have been administratively workable . It would have required a few days at most to work out the details . But the House leaders seemed finally to work themselves into a state of mental paralysis . They could not imagine that they had been assigned a problem of elementary arithmetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of obscure differential equations which could hardly be solved without the new mechanical " brain , " that can " outthink the most acute human intellect , " recently announced by the Rockefeller Foundation . There is to be 75 per cent " forgiveness " for this income group , 50 per cent " forgiveness " for that , or 1941 rates instead of 1942 rates , with " unforgiven parts " of " 1942 liability " carried over for a period of years , and so on . The net of it is that the House will have its choice after May 3 of two bad plans . If the legislative procedure of the House exists for the benefit of the country , and not the country for the benefit of the legislative procedure of the House , let us hope that the whole membership will at least get the opportunity to vote on the full Carlson plan , or on some simpler compromise than either of the two now offered .                  @ @ @
