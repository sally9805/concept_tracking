The Chattanooga Times spoke the concern of many a Southerner : " Picky Pie Hill was murdered , but it is the South which again was lynched in the unreasoning fury of a cowardly mob . " There was some question whether it was actually the act of a mob ( see above ) . But inevitably , the report of the year 's first lynching* attracted wide attention in the nation 's press , obscuring the slower , less spectacular but undeniable improvement in the Negro 's lot in the South . <P> Some 700,000 Negroes qualified to vote in the 1948 elections-six times more than in 1940-and the Atlanta Constitution 's Editor Ralph McGill predicted that 2,000,000 would go to the polls in 1952 . <P> In Atlanta , a bigoted little obstetrician named Samuel Green , the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan , was frantically exhorting his Kleagles and Cyclops to mass for a big night of cross-burning and hate-spieling at Stone Mountain next week to prove to everybody that his movement was n't on the skids . But one Southern governor had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mob of " hooded hoodlums and sheeted jerks , " and in the past year antimasking ordinances had been passed in Atlanta , Columbus and Macon , Ga. , Miami and Tallahassee , Fla. , and a number of smaller communities . In Grand Dragon Green 's home town , the fight against him had been led by the Junior Chamber of Commerce , the Georgia Council of Churchwomen and leaders of Kiwanis , Lions , Rotary and other civic clubs . Reported Alabama 's ( Negro ) Tuskegee Institute last week : " The better element of whites is against the Klan and Negroes are no longer afraid of it . " <P> To Court . Only 25 miles from Picky Pie 's murder , a federal grand jury last week indicted seven men for beating a Negro , and a deputy sheriff for letting them do it . Occasional cowardly attacks on Negroes still took place in the back country , but more &; more such cases were winding up in the courts . <P> In Dallas last week , the City Council ignored grumblings of a delegation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a white contractor , build a 408-unit Negro housing development on land adjacent to a white section . " We talk of doing things to house the Negroes , " argued one of Cothrum 's supporters , " but I do n't blame them for looking at us with distrust in their eyes ... of course we have to make sacrifices . " The city of Jackson , Miss . opened a new $500,000 park for Negroes , then voted a $350,000 bond issue to build a civic auditorium in the park . <P> Jim Crow . Some Negro leaders resented the very steps , small and often grudging , that were making the South a more tolerable place for the Negro to live . They argued that every attempt to build better segregated parks and schools was only perpetuating what they were fighting to end : Jim Crowism . It was probably a valid conclusion . Many white Southerners were working unselfishly to reduce the Negro 's squalor , illiteracy and ill-health , to end his disenfranchisement and ease his fear of violence . Perhaps a majority of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not be changed . <P> <P> * There were two last year , both also in Georgia . Since 1940 there have been 34 , compared to 127 in the preceding ten years , 932 in the years from 1898-1907.
