For the first time since the present game of international power politics began in 1931 ( when Japan seized Manchuria ) the London-Washington Axis dealt the cards last week . With growing concern the Berlin-Rome-Tokyo Axis watched them fall . The removal of the moral embargo against Russia ( see p. 11 ) may have been only a nine-spot , but the missions of such men as Harry Hopkins , Wild Bill Donovan ( see p. 21 ) and Wendell Willkie ( see p. 16 ) might turn up jacks or better . The unprecedented welcome President Roosevelt gave Lord Halifax ( see p. 11 ) was an ace with which the Lend-Lease Bill would neatly pair . <P> To the Berlin-Rome-Tokyo Axis it looked as if the London-Washington Axis were dealing from the bottom of the deck . An angry cry went up . The Italian radio sneered that President Roosevelt had " lowered himself " by going to meet an Ambassador . In Popolo d'ltalia Journal ist Luigi Barzini assured his countrymen that " in the crucial period of the war-not too remote-Great Britain will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. <P> In Berlin the reaction was more thoughtful . The Foreign Office periodical Berlin-Rome-Tokyo published a long arti cle solemnly denying that its Axis planned to attack the U. S .. as solemnly accused the U. S. of trying to provoke an attack . " This is the hour when the Three-Power Pact of Berlin has found its renewed , final justification as a powerful instrument of common defense against aggression , " wrote Berlin-Rome-Tokyo . " Whoever feels himself affected . . . has aggressive intentions . Nor does President Roosevelt make any concealment of these intentions . His only worry is that the nations of the Three-Power Pact do not permit themselves to be provoked . . . . If peaceful relations between two of the largest nations in the world be thus cynically destroyed , Germany does not want with one word to take responsibility for such a crime . " <P> In Tokyo Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka took Cordell Hull to task for saying that the invasion of Manchuria was the first step in the destruction of world peace ( TIME , Jan. 27 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S.-educated Mr. Matsuoka ( Oregon , ' 00 ) , " was not the cause but the result of Anglo-Saxon interference in the Far East . " As the Diet met to vote the Konoye Government unprecedented powers and an unprecedented $1,611,432,400 budget ( not counting war expenses ) , the Foreign Minister found himself on his feet most of the time . He said everything he had ever said before about the U. S. , including the charge that the U. S. is trying to " intervene " in East Asia , and ended his most vocal week with the statement : " As long as the United States regards China instead of the East Pacific as its first line of defense , just so long will friendly relations remain an idle dream . " <P> In such an atmosphere Japan 's new Ambassador to the U. S. , one-eyed Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura , sailed for San Francisco with six glass eyes and a three-point policy . The policy : 1 ) Japan wall stick to the alliance with Germany and Italy ; 2 ) Japan will be boss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will accept Points 1 and 2 , Japan will try to be friends .
