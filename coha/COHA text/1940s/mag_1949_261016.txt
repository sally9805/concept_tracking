Week by week the Soviet satellite states are giving their Roman Catholic priests and nuns fresh insight into the problems of the early Christians . <P> In Rumania the Communist government decreed last week that all welfare activities by Roman Catholic religious orders must cease by Aug. 15 . Monks and nuns engaged in charity and hospital work , said the decree , were no longer needed in a solicitous People 's Democracy . <P> Dissolved by this Communist ukase were about 15 Catholic charitable organizations , among them the internationally known nursing sisters of St. Vincent de Paul . The 1,400 nuns and 100 monks affected were given 15 days to make up their minds whether to 1 ) retire to one of three cloisters and two monasteries set aside by the government for the purpose ; 2 ) enter homes for the aged ; 3 ) quit clerical life altogether and register for jobs at state employment bureaus . <P> In Czechoslovakia the government produced a package of priestly " high treason . " The Rev. Alois Fajstl , the state announced , had been sentenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loss of civil rights for ten years . The charge : when called to give the last rites of the church to a woman apparently dying of pneumonia , Father Fajstl first asked if she were a Communist , then withheld the sacrament until she had sent her son to party headquarters to turn in her membership card . Instead of dying , the government said , the woman recovered and denounced the priest for thus applying the recent Vatican decree of excommunication ( TIME , July 25 ) . <P> Father Fajstl was reported to have denied the charge , refusing at the same time to reveal what actually took place at the woman 's bedside , on the grounds that this would be breaking the seal of the confessional .
