The new contract doubling the tonnage royalties for miners ' pensions and boosting wages SI a day was concurred in by all management groups , except the United States Steel Corporation , which refused to sign the union shop provision . This and all the other provisions except the wage and welfare concessions were carried over from the 1947 contract .

" He did not make it clear whether the higher coal prices also would men higher prices for steel , but soiree economists have predicted that such might be the case . Thus , the threat of another catastrophic mine shutdown has been averted at a time when the hearths of industry are being stoked from coal cars instead of stock piles .

Even more heartening to the men who dig the nation 's coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enlargement of the pension plan . This once Utopian vision of the hourly wage worker now is on the verge of reality .
