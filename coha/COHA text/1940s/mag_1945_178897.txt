In Minneapolis , 35 C.O.s ( conscientious objectors ) have been voluntarily starving for six months . Under the watchful eyes of four religious service committees ( Brethren , Quaker , Mennonite and Unitarian ) , these " human guinea pigs " of some ten denominations have lived in the South Tower of the University of Minnesota stadium , undergoing scientific experiments in semistarvation . This week they were starting a three-month buildup , the final stage in a year 's program . Purpose : to determine the physical and mental effects of starvation on normally healthy men from 19 to 33 , and to find ways of best utilizing food from the limited resources available for the starving populations of war-stricken countries . <P> To Save Lives . The Minnesota study is one of several experiments being performed with C.O.s under the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development and the U.S. Surgeon General 's Office . Over 300 other C.O.s have volunteered for a wide variety of special projects " to help science save lives . " In New Hampshire a group of 35 did road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies which played a part in the development of DDT , the powder which saved bombed Naples from a typhus epidemic ( TIME , Jan. 10 , June 12 , 1944 ) . Five other C.O.s spent days on a life raft off Cape Cod , to determine , among other things , the effects of drinking sea water under shipwreck conditions . <P> Conscientious objection ( refusal to participate in war ) is nothing new in the U.S. There were C.O.s in both the Revolution and the Civil War , when members of Christian groups like the Quakers , Mennonites and Brethren , in the belief that Christ commanded Christians not to kill , refused to fight in armies . In World War II the attitude toward C.O.s and their treatment has been enlightened . The Selective Service Act makes only two conditions for conscientious objection : 1 ) the C.O. must be opposed to " participation in war in any form " ; 2 ) his scruples must come from " religious training and belief . " <P> Following careful hearings , Selective Service has assigned many thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Army ( Class 1-A-O ) , 8,426 to Civilian Public Service camps and special service projects ( to do " work of national importance under civilian direction " Class 4-E ) , and some 5,000 to prison ( including penicillin-research chemist Donald Charles DeVault , who refused to do the work assigned to him in a C.O. camp ) . <P> In Mental Hospitals . The guinea-pig experiments represent only a small part of the overall program of Civilian Public Service camps and special service units . Over 4,000 men from C.P.S. are engaged in other special projects , the most effective of which is work with inmates of public mental hospitals . C.O.s not in special service are assigned to regular C.P.S. camps , where they dig ponds , build roads and trails .
