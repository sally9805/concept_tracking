The Battle of Sicily was in its final phase . Not once did Allied pressure relax in the last 50 miles to Messina . On Aug. 2 , General Sir Bernard Law Montgomery of the British Eighth Army and Lieut . General George Smith Patton Jr . of the U.S. Seventh started an offensive . Within a week the generals and their men had cracked the enemy line from Mt . Etna to the Tyrrhenian Sea . Harried by land , sea and by air , the Germans fell back toward Messina 's crescent beach . Less than four miles across the treacherous strait lay one castlecrowned heights of Italy . <P> One month after the Allied landings , the Italians had quit fighting in Sicily , the Germans faced another Cap Bon , though with some hope of evacuating a remnant . In Sicily , the Axis had lost 125,000 men captured , uncounted thousands dead and wounded , uncounted hundreds of planes , tanks , trucks and guns . They had won a month 's time to bolster Festung Europa ; but they had surely hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grand scale , had sealed their control of the Mediterranean . Now they stood a step from the European main . <P> Yanks Forward . In the final push , U.S. troops drove forward in the north , Canadians in the center , Britons in the south . The Yanks found the terrain worse than Tunisia . The parched , brown land tossed in rocky ridges like the arrested waves of a stormy sea . The roads twisted through the valleys and German guns covered them from the slopes . The Yanks ' job was to blast those slopes and scale them , one by one . <P> Fiercest were the five days around Troina , a craggy road junction shielding the German position on Mt . Etna 's northwest shoulder . The first combat team thrown against Troina by Major General Terry Allen 's ist Infantry Division bounced back hard . German howitzers and mor tars skillfully held the hilltops . The ist Division massed its artillery , called in dive-bombers of the Tactical Air Force . For 72 hours the dust of an Allied barrage hung over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Troina . <P> Along the north coast , where the road chews through solid rock , the Germans set off demolition charges . The Yanks had to toil over and around obliterated roads ; artillery had to be ferried up by sea . Then from ferrying guns the Seventh Army proceeded to ferrying troops . In a bold pre-dawn landing behind the German lines the Americans captured San Agata and Sari Fratello , surprised and destroyed a column of enemy reinforcements . <P> Canadians Forward . As the Eighth Army 's " left hook , " the Canadians shared the job of outflanking Catania , the eastern anchor of the German line . They slugged a path across the terraced hills . They tried their bayonets and lungs in vicious charges through vineyards and lemon orchards . They helped the British into Regalbuto and Centuripe . From that high ground they could roll up the whole German line on Mt . Etna 's western slope . General Montgomery could now begin the envelopment of Catania , and thereby spare his men a costly frontal assault .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
