X3 DRAMA MAILBAG Two Readers Speak Up for Box Office Men , but the Onslaught Continues To the Drama Editor : MAY I raise a lone voice , perhaps , in defense of the box-office treasurer ? The public may have its gripes but the B. 0 . treasurer has , too . That the box-office ststffs keep their patience at all is the amazing thing to me . I have seen patrons walk huffily away ( after being unpleasant ) when they have demanded a front row orchestra or balcony seat three minutes before curtain time . I have heard customers call boxoffice people " liars " when their tickets were not in the reservation boxes , which is completely out of the box-office treasurers ' hands when no tickets have been left . Patrons who forget their tickets or lose them take out their ire on the unfortunate man or woman who is selling tickets . And patrons refuse to believe that when they telephone , give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be resold unless the treasurer has the pasteboards in hand . Recently a patron at a theatre housing a hit insisted that his tickets were in the box office and accused the treasurer of reselling them , with the inference that the money had been pocketed . Both he and his wife were abusive . The next day it was learned that the patron had been advised to pick his tickets up at the club where he had ordered them . Treasurers are human beings , too . The public is not as thoughtful as it believes itself to be . There is something to be said on both sides but after twenty-five years in the theatre , watching treasurers operate from New York to San Francisco , from Chicago to New Orleans , I think that the fault does not lie fully with the box-office treasurer .
