FORETASTE OF GLORY " Poor girl , married to that ornery thing , " more than one woman said . " She did n't know what she was a-gettin ' into . She drove her ducks to a bad market ! " As the spider had spun his web to trap the fly , life had spun a web to trap Dee . Here were Sibbie and Ena and here was his wife Grace pregnant and now he had taken to drink to drown his recurring past . But his beautiful Grace was not only a pretty woman , she was a practical woman . While Dee lay drunk in their one room in the back of the store , Grace went ahead with the business . She was a Northern woman who worked more than she talked . Talk was all right with her except when she had work to do and her husband was too drunk to help then she rolled up her sleeves and went to work no matter if she was pregnant . Blakesburg women had never seen her like , this beautiful woman they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for herself . Grace was fighting " to make a go of their marriage . " She would n't let it go on the rocks even when Dee was drinking more as the months passed . Their first child was born and another was on the way and Dee had become one of the best customers Tid Fortner had . He had to have his pure corn . I le had become a " quart-a-day man " and was now classed with Jeff I largis , Bass Keaton , Bill Simpson , 011 and Temp Spradling , Willie Devers and Boliver Tussie . Everybody said Dee was a goner . But something happenedright before their second child was born . Thursday , September 18th , Dee had lain down on the bed in back of the store . Grace , though heavy with child , had not only waited on their increasing Red Neck trade from the county , but she had made Dee hot toddies all afternoon to sober him . She carried him buttermilk to drink . She also took care of their small son . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they wondered how she did it . They respected her more than ever for her fight and her courage . It was more than any one of them could or would do . FORETASTE OF GLORY 51At approximately eight o'clock that Thursday evening when the people were getting excited about the lights in the sky , Grace went to the door to see what the commotion was . She saw something which she believed to be the same she had seen many times in her native Wisconsin . The lights did n't bother her . She stood observing the electric flashes in the sky remembering how they had flashed over Wisconsin lighting up the fertile farmland on long dark lonely nights . She , too , was amused the way Blakesburg people were taking on . She had never seen anything like it in her life . As she stood in the open doorway , the noise of the shouting people , their prayers and screams went back into the room where Dee was still lying on the bed . " What 's that , Grace ? " Dee asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed and rubbing his head . " Come and see for yourself , " she said . " It 's something .. . I ca n't tell you ! " Dee heard the wild screams , shouts , guitars playing , and peoplesinging hymns . The tumult grew louder and Dee hurried to the door . As soon as he had had one look at the sky he screamed , " My God , what is it ? " " What do you think it is ? " Grace asked calmly . " The end of the world , ' he screamed . " Let 's go to the church ! " " I 'm all right , " Grace said calmly . " Oh , my God , " Dee screamed , leaping wildly into the street . " Save me , 0 Jesus , until tomorrow ! " Grace watched him run toward the Drug Store on his way to the closest church. " 0 Jesus , my God and Saviour , will you be merciful on me a sinner vile and vain , " he screamed before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a buck rabbit through deep snow , his black curly hair bouncing up and down like potatofilledsacks on a jolting wagon . His hands were above his head.
