When France 's gaunt General de Gaulle came to Washington last week it was exactly one year since he had marched into liberated Paris behind the might of U.S. arms . It was little more than 13 months since his last visit to the U.S. , when he had repaid Franklin Roosevelt 's cool reserve with a stiff hauteur of his own . <P> This time Charles de Gaulle was smiling , cordial , no longer unbending . His mission was obvious : to regain U.S. affection for France . He stepped out of the big , silvery Avro York plane jauntily , moved rapidly through the line of stiff-standing French officers to greet Secretary of State James Francis Byrnes . Then he walked to a microphone . The General 's English was slow , but he had brushed up his vocabulary : <P> " The first thing I want to say ... is thank you . We have organized for an immense task , and the United States must play the greatest part . We are in a period of confidence and friendship that will bind France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not long . He concluded abruptly : " Long live the United States of America . " Along the airstrip there were little pats of applause . <P> Red Carpets . A long , black car whisked the General off to the White House . He emerged with right hand outstretched , took a few long steps to where Harry Truman stood awaiting him . Said the President : " I 'm very glad to see you . " That night the red carpet of protocol was rolled out for a White House state dinner , after which Harry Truman and his guest talked together in the library until midnight . What they talked about was not disclosed . <P> After a night at the White House , the General began the long round of duties of a distinguished visitor . He went to Arlington National Cemetery , placed a wreath at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier , received the 21-gun salute due a head of state ( on his previous visit it had been 17 guns-for a general ) . <P> Everything seemed to be going fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After his regular press conference , twelve French journalists remained to be presented . The President shook their hands . Asked if he had a word for them , he said he did . He told them he thought it was high time that the French press began to give America a square deal ( see PRESS ) . <P> <P> Touch . If the remark bothered le grand Charlie , he did not show it . Next morning it was his turn . He met U.S. newsmen at the sumptuous residence of Ambassador Henri Bonnet . He seemed completely at ease , smiled as a newsman brought up the President 's remarks . Oh , yes , said Charlie , he could understand the U.S. President 's being " struck " by some stories in France 's newspapers . He , himself , had also been frequently " struck " by stories about him in the U.S. press . <P> For the rest of the 85-minute interview , the General was the very model of cordiality . He claimed nothing for France , had high praise for her Allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
