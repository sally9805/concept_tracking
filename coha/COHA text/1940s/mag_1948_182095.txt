In 50-man teams " the Legion of Apostles " last week preached vaccination against deadly aftosa ( foot &; mouth disease ) . Across central Mexico , the missionaries of science marched ahead to prepare the way for the nine vaccinating brigades of the joint U.S.-Mexican anti-aftosa commission . <P> To buck the stubborn peasant suspicion that wrecked last year 's campaign to wipe out aftosa by mass slaughter of exposed herds ( TIME , Dec. 8 ) , the Apostles had their missionary line well worked out . The first step was usually to persuade the local governor , general or presidente municipal to put his seal of approval on vaccination by putting his cattle through the process first . Next move was to persuade the parish priest to give a little sermon . Sample : " God has brought a terrible scourge upon us sinners . But God is merciful . He has also brought the anti-aftosa commission . " <P> Pedro 's Cow . In the more advanced villages , the Apostles had no great problem . In others , a week of education usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie , comic books were passed out to all children , telling the absorbing story of Pedro , Ambrosia , their little daughter and their cow . First the cow gave buckets of milk , and the little girl had dolls and shoes . Then the cow got aftosa : Pedro 's daughter became sad , skinny and barefoot . Finally came vaccination and the happy ending . <P> Toughest of all were the backwoods villages , where farmers suspected a gringo plot to poison their animals , and priests preached against interference with God 's will . There the Apostles used any methods they could think of , giving more movie shows , bringing friends of local farmers from other villages to argue for them . In the village of Tula , Jalisco , when all else failed , the Apostles hauled in a load of pulque and set up free drinks . Next morning the villagers awoke with roaring hangovers , found that all their cattle had been vaccinated . <P> Year to Go . Best estimate is that there are 7,500,000 infected animals in Mexico . The overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will cost about $50 million , most of it put up by the U.S. taxpayer . Last week a committee of U.S. Senators was in Mexico to see how things were going . They inspected vaccination teams , toured the laboratories , got reports from the directors . <P> No one could tell them yet whether the drive was winning ; the next six to eight months will give that answer . If vaccination fails to wipe out the plague , then Mexico must probably resign herself to living more or less permanently with aftosa , controlling it as best she can . And the threat of disastrous infection from across the border will hang heavy over the $11 billion U.S. livestock industry .
