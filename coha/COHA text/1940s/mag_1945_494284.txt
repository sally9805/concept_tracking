A SOLDIER and his girl were swaying in a half-dance , their bodies bending to the rhythm of the soft , sweet jazz , their feet shuffling just slightly . In the back of the room , some more soldiers were bunched in a semicircle sipping cokes and swap ? ping stories . Occasionally , one of them would break out into a loud , sharp laugh and keep laughing until the others joined in . Sitting at the tables were some serious-faced couples concentrating on gin rummy . At the desk near the door , right next to a USO sign , the thin girl in the bright dress smiled when she said , " It 's kinda dead around here now . You should have come yesterday . We had a big dance yesterday . " She told how good the band was and how big the crowd was and that there were almost as many vet ? erans around as there were soldiers . " That 's because these boys here in Washington just do n't have too many other places to get together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South , but it 's still a long way from New York City , and a Negro is still a Negro . " She bit her lip when she said that , as if she were trying to stop herself from talking too much . One of the gin-rummy games broke up and a slim , young-looking civilian detached himself from the group , sat down on the sofa , picked up a Popular Science magazine and started thumbing through it slowly . " Look at him , " said the girl at the desk . " That 's Chester Whiteside . He 's been out of the Army since August and he still comes here pretty regularly . He 's lonely . " A few minutes later , Chester was spilling out why he was lonely . It was because he left his wife down in North Carolina teaching school while he came home to Washington to try to find a job until the college term started . Only he could n't find a job . He was a qualified clerk and there was supposed to be a short ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? body seemed to want him . Still , he was n't surprised . He had expected it , he said . He had expected a lot of things . " You hear a lot of stuff about how homesick the overseas American soldier is for the good old USA , " he said . " But you do n't hear much of that from the Negro soldier . Not the ones in Europe . Anyway , not the ones I know , not the ones in the 41st Engineers . Hell , why should they be homesick ? Homesick for Jim Crow , for poll taxes and segregated slums ? Homesick for lynchings and race riot ' ! " He brooded about that for a minute and then he spoke up softly as if he were telling secrets . " I do n't know if you ever heard about some of the race riots we had in Europe . The Army kept it pretty quiet , I guess . Hitler would have loved to hear about it . Well , we had one of them in Marseilles , a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys because they were danc ? ing with white French girls . The girls never even thought about it being something special . To them , we were just people , human beings . But to some of the white soldiers , we were just niggers . I 'll never forget the one who yelled , ' Just wait until the war's. over , we 'll know how to take care of you nigger bastards . ' " Well , " said Chester , still softly , " the war 's over . " Somebody turned up the radio 's volume control . It was a sugary-voiced crooner singing " Embraceable-You " and some of the couples at the food counter joined in , humming loudly . Chester was still in Marseilles . " As I said before , " he continued , " some of the riots were n't so small . A lot of boys got hurt , some got killed . Our boys knew what was coming up . You 'd have to be deaf , dumb and blind not to . " HERE WAS a long moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I lave you ever been to a lynching ? " He seemed to empty himself into the sofa 's softness , leaning his head back , staring at the ceiling , speaking slowly as if he were having a tough time pulling things out of his memory . " It was in a little town called Shelbyville in Ten ? nessee , a long time ago , " he said . " I can still see the teacher running into our class and telling all us colored kids to hurry home and stay home . That 's all she said and none of us knew what was the matter , but tht fear in the teacher 's eyes was like a fever . I remember how we all looked at each other and a few kids started , to cry and then we all raced out of the room and sudden ? ly there were white kids all around us throwing rocks and yelling dirty names and I remember running so fast that I thought my heart would bust wide open . I was seven years old . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing a rapid-running song with tricky words about South America and Love . One girl was shaking in the rhythm of it and two others were watching her , giggling . Chester was tearing small pieces off the back cover of the copy of Popular Science . " We never left our house for three full days , " he said . " I remember all the noise outside and then the sudden quiet , and I remember how scared I alwaYs was and how my mot ' r kept nraying all the time . " I never did get the whole story . I know they burned down the courthouse to grab the colored boy out of jail . He was only 19 . I still do n't know what he was supposed to have done . " He looked at the torn cover of the magazine with ? out seeming to see it and then tossed it on the table . " That was December 25 , 1928 . Is n't it funny the way a date sticks in your mind sometimes : is n't it really funny ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , cracking his knuckles . Then , suddenly , his voice snapped out sharp and bitter , " We had white officers in our outfit , " he said . " Mostly Southern whites . They hated us acid we hated them . The officers who were sympathetic did n't last long ; they got transferred out in a hurry . " You ought to hear the Orientation talks they gave us . The way they talked , Democracy and Segregation meant the same thing . Only they never ever let it go at that . Some of the men got kicked and slapped and cursed and shoved around like scummy dirt ? and what the hell could you do ? " Chester opened his fists and wiggled his fingers . " But there 's a limit to how much you can push people around , " he said , speaking softly again . " Some guys can only take so much . Then they crack . There was one guy who started a one-man riot . He killed an officer and before they hunted him down , he wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he spotted a soldier with a Purple Heart talking seriously with a petite , pretty girl . " See that guy , " said Chester . " He knows how to shoot a rifle now . If somebody ever shoots at him sometime , maybe he 'll shoot back . You get sick and tired of running away all the time . " They had also been sick and tired of hearing white soldiers throw up to them the fact that there were so few Negroes in combat , he said . The way they talked , you 'd think the Negro had something to say about what he did or where he went in the Army . It was in Antwerp that Chester 's outfit first heard about the Army finally deciding to train Negroes as infantry ? men . They were to fight in platoons , alongside white units . Nobody had to volunteer if he did n't want to . But in Chester 's company of 160 , 72 volunteered , some of them offering to take busts from master sergeant to private . But only seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stars for exceptional gallantry in action . " I do n't know why we volunteered in the first place , " said Chester . " Just to show the world that we were willing to fight , even though most of U3 did n't have much to fight for . " A few days ago , I bumped into one of those seven guys , " said Chester . " He and all kinds of ribbons but he was bitter as hell . He said he had just come back899 from the South and it did n't seem to make any differ ? ence if you fought or you did n't fight ; he was still only a black boy . " Chester himself was hopeful when he first came home . They had shipped him to a camp in Wilming ? ton and black and white ate in the same mess hall , slept in the same barracks . The way everybody acted , it seemed as if it had always been that way . It all seemed almost worthwhile ? the stinking wet heat of Liberia and Dakar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airfields they built in Tunisia , Sicily , Sardinia , Corsica , then the D-Day landing at Red Beach in St. Tropez . Three years and three months of it . Then came Fort Bragg and Jim Crow . It was Jim Crow on the bus , too ? an old bus on a bumpy road , but Chester was singing happy . His 118 points had earned him a discharge and he was going to see his Myrtle . " Myrtle 's my wonderful wife , " Chester explained , smiling for the first time . " We got married ten days before I went overseas . " He warmed himself in that and then suddenly he stopped smiling and told about the bus trip . The bus was full when this white man got on and looked around and then whispered something to the bus driver . Then the bus driver got up and looked back at the Jim Crow seats and pointed to Chester and told him to get up and stand . " No nigger is going to sit in my bus while a white man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rather than stand in the bus , Chester got out and walked . It was i6 miles to the nearest town . " I had a lot of time to think , " he said . " I had a hclluva lot of time to think .. .. " The crooner had changed into a quiz show and a tall soldier quickly went over and fiddled with the dials until he got a brassy band bouncing out some jive . One couple automatically started a fast Lindy Hop but the girl stopped in the middle of a twirl and laughed . " There 's not enough room with all these tables , " she said . YRTLE and I are going to Liberia , " said Chester IN I quietly . " We 're going as soon as we can , as soon as I can finish this mortician 's course . " He smiled weakly . " I 'll be the only mortician in Liberia . " He told about how he was the first American Negro soldier to land in Liberia back in May , 1942 , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country was just aching for improvement , with almost ten million uneducated people who did n't even know the fundamentals of sanitation . " Myrtle and I can do some good there , " he said , " and then maybe when we 're lots older , we 'll go to France . Have you ever been to France ? " he asked . " France is wonderful . Over there they practise the tolerance that America only preaches . " Myrtle will love France , " he said , smiling again . " The closest Myrtle ever got to Democracy was here in Washington . She just could n't get over the fact that there actually were n't any Jim Crow seats on the trolley cars . Can you imagine how she 'll feel in France ? Can you just imagine ? " " I 'm so glad we 're going , " he said . " It would have been different if I found America different . I did n't ex ? pect any revolutionary changes in the attitude toward Negroes . All I wanted was a sign in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting better instead of worse . If Congress had only passed an anti-lynch law or a permanent FEPC , something , anything . . . . " A heavy-set girl turned off the radio and announced in a high voice that they were starting a bingo game . " Maybe Myrtle and I are doing the wrong thing , " he said , rubbing his hands nervously . " Maybe we should stay here and stick it out and maybe , God knows , our kids might some day be treated like first-class Americans instead of third-class dirt . " But I guess we 're selfish ; we do n't want to wait that long . In fact we 'll probably give up our American citizenship and become French citizens , like a lot of my friends are doing . " You see , " he said quietly , stretching out his words , " it is n't a question whether Myrtle and I are Ameri ? can citizens or French citizens ; it 's whether or not we 're human beings .
