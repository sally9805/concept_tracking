Most husbands suspect they are a frequent topic of conversation at girl-parties . They 're right . They are . As subjects for debate , praise , comparison , and viewing with alarm , they outrank offspring , clothes , and servant troubles . They are Love as the girls have found it , and the disparity between fiction and fact supplies plenty to talk about . We like you American men . When the talk gets down to bedrock , we admit we love you . But reluctantly aid sadly , we realize that many of you do n't know how to be husbands . Grandpa was a husband . He was a real householder , who knew his home , his provisions , cherished his womenfolk , made decisions . Not only did he earn a living for the family , but he did a lot of living with that family . He came home for a six-o'clock dinner with his entire family , nursery-feeding being considered a decadent European custom . He shared in administering the family discipline and was n't a bit afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was bedtime and what evenings were for going out . Distance and humor paint him as a tyrant . But he did a real job of husbanding , and he was more like a tower of strength than is today 's affable male . Grandfather and his wife were a management team . They consulted each other , considered each other , bowed to each other 's wishes no less than today 's men and women do . But it was grandfather who voiced the final decisions . He assumed the burden of proving the decisions to be wise or taking the responsibility for occasional bad bets . And when we emancipated- gals ? let down our hair , we confess that we long for decisive males who would assume the job of husbanding , with all its responsibilities that reach deeper than bill-paying . We may sound carping and demanding . True , the modern married man is a slave to our whims and the apparent needs of his children . He overworks , gets pushed around by his women , and dies too soon . He is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But few , if any , of us want men who are slaves , pack horses , or future donors of insurance . We want men who are husbands . It might help you men to listen to wife-complaints . Some of these words we fling at you ; but so often in anger or petulance that you miss the real cry of confusion , the honest asking for help . Most of the remarks quoted ? and literally ? occurred at evening gatherings , when we women had congregated because our husbands were working late or had stayed downtown . Some of them were made when men were present but too busy talking shop to talk to us . Maybe we are dull . But you found us bright enough to marry just a few years ago . What has living with you done to us ? Why do n't you force our attention , demand our participation in your worries and cares , your hobbies and hopes ? You do yourselves an injustice if you think we married you solely for support . We brought to our marriage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main link with the larger world is you ; and if you do n't husband us well , we turn into little people with sharp tongues and bitter minds . Too often the situation becomes so bad that divorce seems to be the only solution . Ah , well , let 's proceed to the quotes . " Bob is perfectly willing to go out . He 's told me to get tickets to any show I want to see . He often says , Want to go somewhere ? ' But there 's no fun in that . If only once he 'd tell me he 'd planned an evening for us ! I hate all the deciding and arranging . " ( This poor husband is developing a bitter shrew ; yet he believes he is unusually amiable . For any woman , most of the pleasure of an evening consists in its being thought of , planned for , and executed by a male . ) " Men are so helpless . When the baby had that sudden attack of ap-pendicitis ,  | Joe went to pieces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgeon , even make out the admission papers at the hospital , though heaven knows Joe could have done that . I was scared green , too , but someone had to hold together . " ( Joe tells this story as proof of his fatherly love ? little knowing that it is the seed from which will spring an arrogant woman who will belittle him at every turn . ) " Jack says to get the fur coat . And I 'm going to . I had to argue and argue , but I won . I know perfectly well we can afford it . He works on commission and never admits what he makes . " ( Jack is probably one jump ahead of the sheriff , but he wo n't ask for mercy . He has created this " gim me " wife by never telling her what his income is and what it must do . He should be firm about the fur coat or fair in telling her the economic facts . ) " I 'd never let it get serious , of course , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're attractive . If Bill can eat downtown night after night , I guess I have the right to have a man take me to a nice restaurant just once . " ( Bill is eating downtown in a one-arm joint , so he can go back to his office and do some more work . And it 's all for the little woman ? maybe . Maybe it 's for more power , success , prestige . But these wo n't mean much when he discovers that his wife , from sheer loneliness , is philandering or has found another man , who prefers being with her to working late . ) " Night after night he falls asleep over his paper . I 'm so tired of seeing him asleep on that sofa . It used to be such fun to wait for him to come home . Now he 's cross before he eats , sleepy afterward . " ( No man doing office work is that exhausted physically . He 's escaping to a never-never land of sleep , refreshing neither his own mind nor his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the working day . But it does n't require so much effort as a divorce or coping with a woman frozen in discontent . ) " I always tell Sam when I 've had lunch or cocktails with another man . It 's perfectly harmless . He does n't take me out , so he certainly ca n't complain if someone else does . " ( He ca n't complain , ca n't he ! Why does n't he do more than complain ? True , he does n't own his wife , but if he forbade her to behave like a high-school girl collecting scalps and had a few dates with her himself , he could save this marriage . ) " I do all the disciplining . Jerry has no knack with the children . He 's either too harsh or too lenient , so I told him to leave it to me . " ( This is a woman apologizing for her man , who will not act the fatherrole . The children will be clutched to her , long after she has ceased being a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if he does n't understand the children . They 'll weather his mistakes . His wife wo n't weather his failure to share the discipline burden . ) These are women without husbands : married men with lost , shrewish women . The women sound like spoiled kids . Why not ? They are provided with income but no companionship . They rule as miserable tyrants when they are denied the male strength of their men . And how hungry they are for that strength : How they look to their men for the things American men used to provide : The good provider was not a mere meal ticket . He was many other things : decisive , resourceful , self-confident . He did n't buy domestic peace at any price . because he knew you do n't buy peace . you establish it . He gave his wife respect and demanded it ; reassurance and received it ; insight into his life and worries and received the same from her . He gave her all the blessings that follow when a woman knows she is loved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , included in many marriage promises , were taken seriously : " To hold dear , set a high value upon , to show solicitude for , take care of . " Today 's married men ? and women ? would be happier if they , too , took them seriously . Husbanding is a large job . It 's much more than working hard to bring in the mortgage-and-meat money . ( Women cling to husbands who do very badly at providing material things , very well at providing husbanding . ) But it 's mighty rewarding work . A well-husbanded woman is nice to have around . She has serenity in her face , a light in her eyes , a lilt in her voice . She is happy . Her happiness can make marriage as successful and rewarding as it is meant to be . " Husband : a householder , one who manages well , one who takes care of . " So says the dictionary , with the sad notation , " Archaic . " It is up to the married men to bring that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husbands .  |
