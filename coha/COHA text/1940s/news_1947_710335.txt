txt It is barely a year since I spoke at Fulton at the desire of the President of the United States . I read over again last night what I then said , I was surprised that such mild , mellifluous , carefully shaped and guarded sentiments should have caused so much commotion , not only in America and in my own country but elsewhere . la sum , all I said was that the United Nations organization was the supreme hope of the future ; that the United States should take the lead in this ; that they should not share the secrets of the atomic bomb till international progress Winston Churchill had been made ; that the " fraternal association " of the United States and the British Empire and Commonwealth of Nations  --  the English-speaking world ? should not only be maintained but developed ; that they should share bases and // have similar weapons , and that they should work for the ideals which they have in common , in menace to none and for the safety of all . . - It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the Continent Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient state of Central and Eastern Europe .

Truman Plan Focuses Issue Now , by the momentous declaration of President Truman , supported by the leading American statesmen of both Der- acratic and Republican parties , they are focused directly upon the eastern Mediterranean . The President has made it plain that vital American interests and duties exist in these waters and throughout the Middle East , and that the United States Government will not suffer such interests to be molested or undermined , nor these duties flinched from or neglected . Should Congress confirm the policy and action recommended by the President , a new situation will be created in the Mediterranean : full of hope for the future of the Middle East and also to the future peace of the world and the United gations organization newly creatml to maintain it . - Greece and Turkey are the two countries primarily affected .

But all the same , it was done .

" This is precisely the issue which broke upon us in Athens in December , 1944 , when I was at the head of His Majesty 's Government . It fell to me to take important executive action . I must emphasize that I acted with the full authority and agreement of my colleagues in the British National War Cabinet . We also felt at that time , like Mr. Dean Acheson now , and I do not doubt the opinion is maintained by the present LaborSocialist Cabinet , that " a Communist-dominated Government in Greece would be- dangerous to British security , " and to the general cause of freedom , for which we had contended so long . In December , 1944 , however , the case was aggravated and rendered urgent in the last degree by the irerninence of a Communist coup d'etat enforced by methods of bloody violence on a formidable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allies had been brought back to Athens by a few British troops and aircraft and their own scanty Greek forces as the Germans fled . This operation was undertaken with the full approval of President Roosevelt The King of the Hellenes and his brother , driven out by the Germans , naturally wished to return at the head of this small expedition . British policy , long declared , had , however , been to seek a plebiscite on the monarchist issue ; and the King deferred to our wishes and-awaited in London the decision of the Greek nation . In this way I hoped to convince leftish sections of American opinion that British policy on Greece was based upon nothing less than the freely expressed Will of the Greek people . Hopes in Athens Recalled Premier Papandreou , at the head of a Government of all parties , including six Communist Ministers , and based on solemn agreements between them was received with broad-based lively demonstrations of welcome in - the streets of the capital . There was a passionate hope in Athens that the troubles were over . The Nazis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mend . However , the Communist guerrilla bands , most of whom had d Jne little or nothing against the German invaders and had ; for their own dark purposes , hoarded the arms and ammunition we had given them to fight the common enemy , descended from the mountains , claiming to be the saviors of Greece , - and also its rulers with totalitarian power . They infiltrated and forced their way into Athens , where a : million people lived , and began a violent , murderous attack upon the police stations and other establishments of the newly arrived , feeble , distracted , all-party Government . The six Communist Ministers had done all they could by peaceful and constitutional influence to weaken the military forces at the disposal of the . Greek Government and to secure the increasing admission of . Communist elements thereto . At the same time they enjoined moderation , conciliation , comradeship and broad-based tolerance and liberalism upon their fellow Ministers .. Many concessions had been made to them during an agitated November . On Dec. 5 1944 came the night when the Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or kill all who opposed them . Most of the police stations were stormed , their occupants in many cases being killed to a man . The Communist bands , slaughtering ? all who stood in their path , had got within half a mile or less of the center of kovernment . At this moment , long-plotted , carefully timed , all the six Communist Ministers  --  one was a little late  --  withdrew from the Government They flung down their resignations and ran like rats to join what they believed - to be the Victorious Communist mastery of Athens . Ordered British Forces to Act Late one night at this time I drafted a telegram to our General Scobie Lieut . Gen. Ronald M. Scobie , then commander of British forces in Greece ; who had come into Athens with 3,000 men to help drive out the Germans , that he must no longer consider himself neutral between the Greek parties , but , on the contrary , should sustain Premier Papandreou , and not hesitate to fire upon- the Communist assailants . This order was . sent at about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was only just in time . The British troops , in small parties , advanced and fired upon the attacking Communists , who thought they had all in their grip , ? but who fell back a little at this check and gave time for what was left of the Greek Government to pull itself together . In those weeks when Athens was being saved in the nick of time I was much scolded by what are considered Left-Wing progressive organs and - elements of opinion in articulate Allied countries . The London Times , The Manchester Guardian , joined with a very large proportion of American newspapers in their censure of " British imperialist aggressioe in Greece . " I was astonished to see what a bad press I got in America . Besides this the ? attitude of . the State D4artinent was sourly critical . A statement was issued by the new Secretary of State Edward R. Stettinius Jr. about British policy in Italy which exceeded in acerbity anything ever said by the American Government about the Soviet Union , with ' whom they had had so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harsh communications . I was de . pitted in many newspapers as a shocking jingo , Tory , imperialist reactionary , striving to beat down the free , generous , democratic impulsion of the Greek ? people .. Even President Roosevelt , who= I had kept - constantly informed about our Greek policy , remained silent under a series of personal protesting telegrams from Me . When one has been in such close mental and moral relationship as I have been , and still aspire to be , with , great tides of public opinion in a brother nation , it is a shock to feel them flow all of a sudden in the opposite direction . Notes Support by Sevin At home there was a political stir . But the National Coalition was solid ; and the War Cabinet had seen a lot of trouble overcome . No one swerved or failed . Mr. Bevin , Minister of Labor , with his characteristic faithfulness , and never afraid to tell the truth as he saw it to anyone , assuaged and dominated the Trade Union Conference , which happened to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three British divisions moved gradually into the city . For forty days of street fighting we battled for the life and soul of Athens . Ward by ward , district by district , almost house by house , the Communist intruders were driven back and ? finally out , with heavy losses . In their withdrawal they murdered at least 20,000 men , women and children whom they did not like or who got in their way . But eventually , in spite of a storm of Left-Wing criticism , which , having a good conscience , I bore without vexation , the city of Athens and the Greek nation were saved from becoming a Communist totalitarian state . After much labor and exertion , they were even-allowed a free vote about what kind of country they wanted to be and what kind of government they wanted to have . Both at the elections and in the plebiscite the Greeks voted as I had always believe -1 and predicted . There is no part of my work of the righteousness of which I am more profoundly convinced than the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it is upon the foundation of this work that the United States is able to take its stand today . As Mr. Dean Acheson expresses it : " A Communist-dominated government in Greece would be considered dangerous to United States security . " GREEK NATION WERE SAVED ' Mr. Churchill , as he appeared in Athens early in 1945 with British troops who had driven out " the Communist intruders . " The New York Times He Cites Citrine Inquiry In all this Greek business , which searches curiously into the quarrels of modern- intellectuals , I base myself upon two unimpeachable documents . The first is  --  the report of the British trade union delegation headed by Sir Walter Citrine , now Lord Citrine , which visited Athens in January , 1945 , and saw , unearthed before them in their mass graves , the long rows of corpses of the victims butchered by the Communists as they were gradually . driven back . They reported fully ) and faithfully to Parliament ' and their testimony was accepted by the British people . The second is the Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American-Anglo-French commission and cited by President Truman in his recent message to Congress as a free and fair expression of Greek public opinion . All the talk and denunciation of British imperialism in Greece was sheer nonsense . We had no special interest to serve , except the cause of freedom ; and many others are involved in that . We sought and seek nothing from Greece but to give her a fair chance of revival and thus to do our duty to which we had pledged ourselves by- long sentiment and alliance . I have thought it right to record these notes of the recent past , because nowadays people forget so quickly and there is such a clatter going on , with something to startle or puzzle one every day , and also because there must be a background to every picture . The scene which we have to contemplate and try to measure at this moment is enormous . It comprises all the passions of mankind , all the policies and anxieties of the victorious powers , and upon a correct judgment of it depend the peace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
