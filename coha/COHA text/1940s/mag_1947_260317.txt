A new translation of the Psalms is being published in the U.S. next week . Modern readers will miss the drums and tramplings of the King James version-but the simple , matter-of-fact English of Britain 's witty , whodunit-writing Monsignor Ronald A. Knox ( The Psalms , Sheed &; Ward , $2 ) gives some of David 's songs a sharp new applicability . Excerpt ( Psalm 2 ) : <P> " ' What means this turmoil among the nations ? Why do the peoples cherish vain dreams ? See how the kings of the earth stand in array , how its rulers make common cause , against the Lord . . . . Princes , take warning ; learn your lesson , you that rule the world . Tremble , and serve the Lord , rejoicing in His presence , but with awe in your hearts ; kiss the rod , do not brave the Lord 's anger , and go astray from the sure path . When the fire of His vengeance blazes out suddenly , happy are they who find their refuge in Him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
