 | the War from Inside a Tank By Ira Wolfed BEFORE we were sent on tank maneuvers in America , the the Lieutenant said , " they gave us written field orders that told what we were supposed and not opposed to do , where to go and how get there , what to take with us and here to place it , and not to please knock down any telephone poles along way . But when we came to doing business on a live battlefield , nobody had time to write anything down . The battalion commander , Lieutenant Colonel E. T. McConnell , just rove up to my tank in his jeep and ? id to me , I want your platoon to be the point today . Take off and keep in touch with me . ' " This ' was early last August near Avranches in western France , at the time General Patton was beginning I is drive toward Germany . The Lieutenant is 26-year-old George Hook of Middletown , Ohio , on of Charles R. Hook , head of the American Rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sweep began until it ended outside Metz , Lieutenant Hook more often than not rode in the lead tank The day a German shell broke two vertebrae in Lieutenant Hook 's neck was the day the whole Third Army ground to a halt , before German positions too strong for it . Except for the fact that Lieutenant Hook was at the very front of Pat ton 's forces , his story is not unusual . It is , in fact , typical of the fighting done by all tankmen ? the Russians who went from Stalingrad to Kuestrin , the British who pushed Rommel across Africa , the Americans and British who finally broke out beyond the Rhine . " When we started , " the Lieutenant said , " we were just told what road to take and to keep going until ordered to stop . The tanks went tearing . The Germans ran after us and our army ran after the Germans . This kind of war seems confusing to the people back home , but it 's easy enough to follow if you look at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thick belt in front of itself . That 's the line . ' But they ca n't be equally strong everywhere , and somewhere your infantry makes a break-through and shakes the tanks loose . In the area behind the line are headquarters , supply dumps , reserves , communications . When tanks get into that kind of stuff , everybody starts chasing everybody else . "  | An army advancing is a terrifying sight , immense with power , filling the fields , choking the roads , streaming across rivers , a glacial crust inching across a nation . But in the forward areas it thins out until finally it 's just a few men or one man , fumbling along in a worried way . That is " the point , " short for " point of fire " ? a probe thrust into the enemy to stimulate him to react and reveal his position and strength . " We took off into flat , wooded country , " said the Lieutenant . " The woods could have hidden anything . The standard solution for such a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with a platoon of infantry in half-tracks , and then close with the three other tanks . On a road there is always a rise of ground or a curve or something to hide behind , and the first two tanks play leapfrog with each other : while one stays behind cover , ready to shoot whatever shows , the second tank dashes on down the road for the next bit of cover . And so on , until a battle starts and you have to commit your infantry . " We played leapfrog quite a while , until there was no use in doing it any longer because we were in woods where a tank that stood still was just as vulnerable as the one making a dash . So we threw the schoolbook away and everybody stepped on the gas . Every time we got down to 18 miles an hour the Colonel was on the radio wanting to know why . Our job was to keep going and steamroller a path for anybody coming behind . " When we got up behind Argentan , word came that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dump there but we were not wait for the air ; we were to keep ing . I saw about ten Thunderbolts , diving down on the dump far ahead and then six bicycles turned into t road a mile ahead of us . The cyclist saw us and really started pedaling . " I was traveling with the turrets open ? unbuttoned , we call it . Near every tank commander travels tit way . When you button up your turrets , you have to depend for vision on a periscope . Your vision starts 20 feet from the tank , you are blind to anything closer . If you overlook a German in a hole or behind window , all he 'd have to do is hold onto his nerve and wait until you were within 20 feet of him , a you 'd never know what hit you . I sides , from the turret periscope you can see is ground slipping towards you : there is nothing to orient it with and tell whether you 're going backward , forward or even sideways . ' 1 made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We closed on the cyclists to about ) . 30o yards . Just as I gave the order fire they threw down their bicyclist and leaped for the woods . We one Jerry in midair . The other disappeared . " I jumped up on the turret se and yelled , Jerries ! ' to the infant back of us and pointed to the woo . They got the idea . Their half-track stopped , the men piled out and began working into the woods , low a crouched over . " About 1000 yards from where the town began , some 50 Jerries jumped out of a ditch and ran across the road and toward a rise of ground . W.  | opened up on them . They were crews f two 88 's that had taken shelter from our planes . We got some on the run and some while they were trying to load their guns . " When you 're the point , the question is n't who will fire the first shot that's 's almost always the enemy ) but who will hit his target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ditch , there was the terrible zziiiing . I an antitank shell going past my ears . I was looking at the spot where would have set up an antitank gun I 'd had the job of protecting that bad , so I caught the flash of the mm. gun . Corporal Robert Ma. the gunner of our tank , the Anxious Annie , ' had time for one shot before the Germans could try another . There was a red burst , and I saw black pieces ? debris of the a n or the men firing it ? streaking rough the flash . " We stopped then . It was plain that the town was defended , and it seemed logical to have the infantry lean it up before the tanks went through . I told the Colonel my idea . " Pretty soon our infantry began lining up in the ditches alongside road . I could see artillery shells going into them . Then Sergeant Gaffney came running up along the ditch say that our No. 4. tank had been hit . I grabbed a fire extinguisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't drop when the shells hit close it just ran through the blast of them . four of the five men in the tank had out ; I tried to pull the driver out , t found he was dead . His body looked as if it had been put through a chopper and then burned . ' Awful things can happen to a man in a tank . It 's always heavy shells that get through and if one of them hits him it 's like a hydraulic hammer smashing him . And when a shell goes into a tank it always sets your own ammunition off . " A German panther tank was firing at us now and had got our priest ' ( a tank with a I05-MM. howitzer ) , so I started toward him . I told the No. 2 tank , commanded by Sergeant William Wickham , to move off the road to the left and I went straight down the road . " There was a high brick wall on the left that might hide something and we stopped just ahead of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks . It 's funny how far that squeaking carries . Even if tanks ' motors are roaring and their guns blasting , the sound you hear first is the squeaking of the tracks . A combat command of tanks advancing sounds like a million mice squeaking . " When the Jerry tank stuck its nose out cautiously beyond the wall Wickham was waiting for him , and with very fine shooting opened his whole side up . " Then things got quieter . Our orders were to keep going , so I told all the tanks within sound to follow me . I had lost my maps while running to our No. 4 tank , so I went on memory . It was really black night now . I went under a railroad viaduct and saw near the road a German half-track that had been strafed by our planes and was burning . By the light of the flames I saw a column of German trucks and two half-tracks parked there and we shot them to pieces . " We came to a square in the town , and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scuttled into the street ahead of us and we threw a shell into its hind end . It rolled over , burning . We went crunching over it because there was no room to go around it . Finally we got outside the town . " Now one after another our tank commanders started calling to me that they were out of gas . We pulled into a field and I got Captain Malcolm O. Allen , our company commander , on the radio . " Withdraw , ' he said . We 'll take the town in the morning with infantry . ' " Hell , ' I told him , it 's done been tooken already ! ' " COMBAT COMMAND A of the Seventh Armored Division of the Third Army now lay across the eastern approaches to Argentan . In the Argentan-Falaise area the bulk of the German army of the west was trapped . When the Germans lost this army they lost the Battle of France and Belgium , though this was not clear at the time to those on the ground there . The next line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seine River . " We breached the line there , " Lieutenant Hook said , " at a place called Port Seine . The Germans held the east bank ; our job was to hold the west bank and cover our infantry when they crossed . " There was a high ridge with a lot of trees on it . We sneaked in among the trees , took our axes and cleared fields of fire for ourselves . " At two o'clock Thunderbolts strafed and dive-bombed the Germans , we cut loose with our 75 's and machine guns , and the infantry assault boats paddled across the river . I Then a German machine gun hidden in a clump of trees caught the infantry in the back . We cut loose on it and put it out of action . " Some of the infantry started working up the east bank of the river . We knew there were still Jerries there and Major John Brown and I screamed to warn our men . Of course they could n't hear us . A tall , thin boy was in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned around and started marching him back . Another Jerry popped out of a hole and scrambled after them as if to say , Wait for me . ' Then the doughfoot began looking in foxholes for souvenirs . I could n't believe my eyes . He kept throwing this away and keeping that and looking for places to put things in his stuffed pockets while his two prisoners waited patiently . " Well , ' Major Brown said , he 's cool . You 've got to say that for him . ' " With the infantry safely across the Seine we crawled under our tanks and slept until the engineers could throw a pontoon bridge across for us . We went over the next morning . Mortars and machine guns began popping at us from all directions . I went up the road into a hail of machine-gun fire . It turned out to be from our own infantry . What the hell are you shooting at ? ' I asked one . Somebody fired at me , ' he said . But do n't you know your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , ' he told me , if somebody fires at me , I fire at them . That 's ipso facto . ' " We went up to Provins from there , clearing the east bank of the  | river for further crossings , and turned , mst . Then Captain William Powers id to me , I 've got a job you 'll i Ice . ' There was a company of Gertan infantry coming into Provins hat night and he wanted me to sit outside the town and greet them . ergeants Wickham and Janey brought heir tanks along with mine and we I ad a platoon of infantry . The infani ry had been working over German positions all day and was well supplied with champagne and cognac . Ve waited in fields alongside the oad . Every once in a while the rowd would start singing . I 'd go Town and explain to the sergeant 1 command of the doughfoots , Shut he boys up . You ca n't hunt birds lids way . ' " Then we heard singing coming from down the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our boys in town were coming to join our party . But it was from the other direction and I knew these people dust be Germans . Orders were for nobody to fire until I fired . I could make out a mass of forms 20o yards sway , dense-packed and singing with roar . I waited until they got within , o yards , then opened up with my tommy gun , and all our machine guns followed . It was a massacre . " The Germans had n't known that the Americans had crossed the Seine . They did n't even know where their own troops were , and as our tanks lanced and trampled their rear , their chances of finding out grew less and less . " I was next told to take off for Chateau Thierry and to cross the Marne and secure a bridgehead . And do they want me to bring back Hitler 's mustache , too ? ' I thought . It seemed crazy to expect a tank platoon to ride in there without getting its block knocked off . " We kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The trucks were full of troops feeding toward the Seine . They 'd see us and try to turn , and we 'd get them broadside . Mathias was shooting wonderfully that day . " At one place , a road came out of the woods to the right and merged into ours . A German mechanized column was moving down this road , slanting across our front porch , you might say . I told the No. 2 tank to get the rearmost vehicle and I took the lead vehicle . Then we had the road blocked fore and aft , and I brought my platoon up abreast and we kept pumping until we had every vehicle in the column burning . " There was a lot of stuff behind the rear vehicle that had backed off into the woods . I radioed to ask if I should go after it . Keep going , ' they said . General Bradley was sitting on General Patton 's back , I guess , hollering Keep going , ' and Patton was sitting on corps ' back , hollering Keep going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on combat command , combat command on battalion , battalion on company , and company was prodding the point ? which was us ? all hollering Keep going ! ' So I kept going . " Some French resistance men jumped on my tank and led us to where the Germans had been mining the road . It looked so obvious that I suspected the thing was a plant . I got out and dug with my penknife into the refilled holes in the road , but  | there were no mines . We found that the mines were all on the shoulders of the road . The Germans had expected us to come batting along , see the refilled holes , swerve off to the shoulders , and blow up . I radioed the news back , left the Frenchmen there to warn those coming up to stick to the road , and kept going . " About four o'clock a motorcycle tore down the road toward us and threw itself into a ditch about 50 yards away . I told Mathias to keep the Jerry from slapping a beehive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we saw pieces of the German and his equipment fly over a tree . " A motorcycle usually has something behind it , and we kept on the alert . Soon we saw , a mile away , eight-inchers , howitzers , 76 's , all murderous stuff , being pulled onto the road . There were also supply and ammunition vehicles . I spread my platoon of tanks across the field in echelon formation and we opened fire at 800 yards , shooting fast and carefully . We could n't afford to miss , so we did n't miss . " We got a lot of prisoners there . We rounded them up in a field , and I thought I 'd get myself a souvenir which I had always wanted ? a Luger pistol . Our colonel came roaring up . Why the hell are you sitting here ? ' he shouted . It 's been quite a battle here , ' I explained , and we 've got all these prisoners and do n't know what to do with them . ' The hell with the prisoners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dusk came on . Then there was a sign on the road : Chdteau Thiery , 1 1/2 Kilometres . We 're winning the whole damned war , ' I said over the radio . Keep on moving ! ' yelled the Colon " A half mile outside the city was column of German supply trucks ammunition , clothing , food . It eight o'clock then , and deep t light . We came up shooting and t Germans jumped out of their vehicl and ran crying Kamerad ' or lay still or held their hands up to us imploringly . We barreled on past the side the column , running over whatever was there , debris or men , and shooting around to the side . " Ahead was a bridge over what thought was the Marne , but the was no time to look at a map . 76-mm. antitank gun was shoot ! ! down the road at us from a corn . of the bridge . We were in an alley . there and the shells were going ban and forth like bowling balls , but Mathias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bridge and on t another canal bridge when a 2o-min. , cannon opened up on us . There w a smack that was like a kick in the heart , and a spurt of flame that toe my eyelashes off . The shell ha knocked the driver 's periscope off an he had veered , and we hung on t bridge by one track . When the drive Sergeant Brodie Butler , got the ringing out of his head he pulled t whole sight down , put a new plastic head on it , backed onto the bridge and got us going again ? all this very calmly and efficiently while t shells were whipping around us like sparks off a grindstone . " Finally we came to a big bridge There was an ammunition truck o it and we started it burning and edged past it . On the other side I shifted the tanks around to command the roads leading to the bridge and  | ran back to find the Colonel . Keep going , ' he yelled . And get that damn truck off there before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my . irm in front of my face and managed o throw a cable over the truck 's I Jumper and one of our tanks towed i i off the bridge . " Now we were over the Marne at last . But we were cut off in the town i he rest of that night . We had rushed past a whole choke of German traffic , and the rest of the command behind is could n't get through it . All we had n the town was a battalion of tanks , .1 company of infantry , and the headquarters . The Germans started pounding us with artillery , and the French resistance people and local gendarmes led infantry squads to the buildings where the Germans were hiding . The town was a madhouse all night with guns screaming everywhere and big shells whamming down . But by eight in the morning the rest of the outfit had punched through and we took off for Rheims . " The war went altogether crazy after that . Every day was like the hayride from Provins to Chateau Thierry , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans and wandering Germans and Gestapo guys and SS fellows in black uniforms driving cars , trucks , horses , and on motorcycles and bicycles . We poked the chaos up and made it burn . " At Fort Brimont , near Rheims , the Germans in a factory making airplane parts kept on working unti. our infantry walked in on them . " In one town , Jerry riflemen pot . ted at us from the houses . I tole gunner David McFarland to wort over the second-story windows and the roofs with his machine gun while Mike O'Cassio pounded the ground floors with our 75 . Suddenly there was a terrific explosion a few feet in front of us and smoke and flame vomited over us . A Nazi was rolling teller mines at us from around the corner of a building . We got him just before the second mine went off ahead of us . " We got out of that nightmare of a town and into an apple orchard and waited for somebody to catch up with us . Then I heard the Colonel asking what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German trucks burning , ' I told him . You go straight past them and a motorcycle burning and after that an armored car burning and you 'll see an apple orchard . We 're in the orchard . ' " Take off , ' he said . We 'll follow you . ' I told my platoon , Let 's go , boys . They want us to win the war tonight . ' " We went through the Argonne at 35 miles an hour . We came to a place called Nixeville . Suddenly our tank lifted up . I felt as if I had been taken by the scruff of the neck and shaken so hard that my legs nearly broke off at the hip . Butler said he could n't back up , we were stuck . Then some 88 's cut loose at us from somewhere close by . We started hitting back , but our tiredness and that first wallop had done something to our shooting ? we could n't drive one home . " I kept looking at the muzzle flashes . One shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and through a gunner and the leader , and blew up in the turret . The next thing I knew I was in the middle of  | the road . I dragged myself to a ditch . I could see big flames coming out of our turret . A man was lying beside the tank . Lieutenant ! ' he kept calling . Lieutenant ! ' " I ran over to him . It was Mike O'Cassio . I told him to roll over on his stomach and put his hands around my neck . The Germans were still trying to kill us , but we were low down to the road and not very good targets . I crawled on my hands and knees to the ditch , Mike holding onto my neck , and to a hut 50 yards away . The other tanks were nearby , waiting for , our priests ' to come up with their 105 howitzers which could shoot over the curve and drop down on the 88 's . " When the daze wore off I found there was nothing wrong with me except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over with bits of fragment . I went to sleep under a tank , and the next morning we fought into Verdun and seized the bridges there . Then we waited for supplies to catch up with us . " No matter how fast we had come on our wild ride , or how far , every morning the familiar five-gallon cans of gasoline and new ammunition and rations had been waiting for us . How those fellows in the rear managed to move their dumps forward so fast , and fight the stuff up to us through the Germans that we left behind everywhere , was a mystery to me . But finally there came a point when they could n't do it any more . We were just too far ahead . For our outfit , that point was reached just outside Verdun . " In the five days ' rest there we all got brand-new 76-mm. tanks , a shave and fresh meat to eat . Then we headed for Metz , going fast until w got to St. Privat . The Germans ha built up a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We went breezing right into it in the manner to which we had become accustomed . The Jerries let us have it with everything in the book . There was so much noise that I did n't hear the shells falling ; I just heard tank commanders hollering . I looked around and there were some fellows crawling toward me from Sergeant Wickham 's tank . I yelled , Find cover , ' and put m head over the turret to see if I coul spot the guns in the woods . That was my last act as a platoon leader of Company A. " I never felt anything when that shell hit our turret and broke my neck . There was no noise or flash or fear or burn . I had my head out looking at the woods , and suddenly I was lying on the bottom of the turret looking up . I could n't move my arms or legs . Lieutenant Hook is dead , ' I heard the man in the turret say over the radio . I made a desperate effort and nudged him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , made a final desperate effort and winked at him . Then I passed out . " * The wild hayride was over . Hook had ridden it out for 37 days , a lifetime as far as points go . It was two months before the Third Army progressed beyond St. Privat , but this spring it went on another such ride ? across Germany .
