A Norseman plane landed last week in the Albany River where it empties into bleak James Bay . A man carrying a sheaf of papers went ashore with the pilot and walked toward a line of unpainted shacks and squalid tents on-the river bank . Huskies , chained to stakes around every dwelling , set up a howl . Ragged Indian children left their baseball game on the muskeg to crowd around the strangers . <P> The man with the papers was Election Officer Lucien Guertin . He had come to Fort Albany from Cochrane , 220 miles to the south , to arrange for the voting in Ontario 's June 7 provincial election . This was the first time since 1939 that Fort Albany 's 36 eligible citizens had had a chance to vote . " Who are the candidates ? " asked Father Jules Leguerrier , head of the Roman Catholic Mission . <P> Elsewhere in Ontario and in two other Canadian provinces , most voters were better informed than Father Leguerrier . Campaigns were already under way in Saskatchewan ( election : June 24 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Alberta citizens , promised an election this summer , were still waiting for their premiers to name the day .
