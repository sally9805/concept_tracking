Most thoughtful scientists are deeply worried about having their discoveries turned into weapons of war . They fear that they will be cast as the real villains of a World War III . This fear is well founded . Last week an anonymous* article in the Christian Century blasted the scientists as " modern mercenaries " who will serve any master , however evil , that helps them in their research . <P> " Scientists , " writes " One of Them , " " are the mercenaries of modern warfare . Almost wholly devoid of humanitarian impulses , they consider their cold and analytical search for scientific knowledge more important than any current affairs of mere mortals . If a scientist is given a chance to pursue his line of research unmolested , he does n't care about the type of government he is working under , or the condition of the people , or anything else . Science is the thing , not people . . . <P> " Give a scientist a problem , any problem , and he is happy . During the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever before . The scientists . . . came up with schemes that military men never dreamed of . " <P> The author does not accept this activity as patriotism in time of war , nor does he accept the scientists ' broader claim that they are not responsible for the way the world utilizes their discoveries . " I would say , " writes he , " that this is the No. 1 fallacy of the scientific mind . . . Certainly they are responsible . . . Certainly they can control how their new scientific principles are utilized ; certainly they have to consider the implications of their research , and not merely strive blindly for facts , facts , facts . " <P> The author does not suggest how scientists can decide which facts to avoid uncovering-or how to tell in advance what good or what evil a new discovery may lead to . But he does suggest a general attitude that may be more high-minded than practical : " To prove that they are not mercenaries . . . they might take a stand against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technicians to stop making more bombs . They might indeed stop supporting war , either directly or indirectly . . . The people want our scientists to do more than damn the use of yesterday 's weapons . They want them to stop making weapons for new wars . " <P> <P> - The author , who signs himself " One of Them , " claims to be a scientist who has worked on a military project .
