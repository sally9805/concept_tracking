txt LABOR PARTY THIRST for nationalization is unquenched . It 's all summed up in a new slick-paper document called " Public Ownership ? Next Step , " issued by the - party for rank and file discussion . The booklet lays down rules for picking new nationalization schemes to go into the party 's next general election program . The authors suggest nationalization of inlustries which are basic suppliers of raw materials to other industries ; vital to human life , health or defense ; monopolized by large trusts ; inefficient because of inability to find funds for capital development or because they 're split up into units too small for economic operation ; spffering from bad labor relations . The authors of the booklet do n't suggest specific industries for state control , but point out the Ministry of Labor 's lists already offer over 100 possibilities . They also recall resolutions submitted to last year 's party conference demanded state control of the chemical , automotive , cotton , shipbuilding , milk distribution , betting and brewery industries . ? ? ? TRAVEL MEN EXPECT 100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they hope Yankees will pour about $44 million into dollar-dry coffers of the British treasury . Last year , some 80,000 Americans visited Britain 's shores and spent around $36 million . Britons , traditionally indifferent to the value of tourism . are just waking up to its importance in the nation 's trade balance sheet . They 've discovered that last year its dollar earnings ran neck and neck with $36 million in textile exports to America . Travel folk estimate tourist revenue represented something like 15% of the total value of British exports to the United States last year . However , many here wonder whether Britain and its pegged pound will be able to compete with nearby France and its free dollar market which is bound to be a sure-fire American tourist lure . In addition , they say , France has far more to offer tourists in the way of food and hotel accommodations than austerity-bound Britain . ? ? ? CABBIES RULE the roost in transportshy London and Paris . Making hay while gasoline is strictly rationed in both countries , cab jockeys are picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers often pass up prospective fares , particularly at night , ? if they do n't look well-heeled . Or they say they have n't enough gasoline to reach the requested destination . In Paris where only about 1,000 out of a normal 8,000 taxis are operating . it is often impossible to snare a cab .. London cabbies complain they 're still supposed to operate on 1919 fares of 18 cents for the first three-quarters of a mile and six cents for every one-third of a mile thereafter . These , they claim , are way out of line with present day living costs . They argue that with only enough gasoline to do 60 miles of hacking daily , they 've got to pick clients carefully . Paris cabmen , who 've just had their fares upped , also grumble their official tariffs are too low to vie with the French cost of living . ? ? ? BRITAIN 'S ECONOMIC CZAR . Sir Stafford Cripps , is expected to get a shellacking from the rank and file of the Labor Party at its annual conclave at Scarsborough in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference agenda indicate party members are dissatisfied with the government 's policy on price and profit control . For example , the Power Transport General Workers Union is trumpeting doubt as to whether profits can be.controlled by reliance on voluntary efforts of manufacturers and distributors . The union calls for government curbs on " exorbitant profit distribution . " Likewise , Labor Party representatives from Manchester demand more drastic control of prices and profits . They brush aside the government 's move to " freeze " wages voluntarily . The conference will also raise an important constitutional issue involving the government 's relations with the party which is the backbone of its support . This will stem from a resolution demanding that decisions made by the party conference should be binding on the government . In other words , if a local group ' wants to abolish pinball machine parlors by legislation and the move is carried by the conference , the government would have to carry out that wish in Parliament . The party 's high command , which includes several cabinet ministers , will almost certainly buck this move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London tobacco shops for the first time since pre-war days . But they 're only available in driblets and cost 80 cents for a pack of 20 . ( The same number of British cigarettes costs 68 cents . ) Before the war , popular brand American cigarettes retailed at 35 cents a pack , compared with 25 cents for an equal number of British . The high price for Yankee brands stems from high custom duties . ? ? ? THE CHURCHES ' COMMITTEE on Gambling , avowed ' enemy of organized games of chance , is hopping mad at Austin Motor Co.
