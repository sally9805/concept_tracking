txt General Motors ' 11-cent hourly wage boost is expected to set the 1948 wage pattern throughout the nation 's manufacturing industry . The offer is subject to ratification by the 225,000 members of the CIO United Auto Workers ' GM locals . But that is considered merely a formality . Government officials hailed the announcement in the hope that it will ring the bell ending round three in organized labor 's fight for a bigger share of industry 's profits . The GM-UAW agreement , reached after 37 bargaining sessions , is expected to bring Chrysler into line where some 75,000 workers have been on strike for two weeks following the union 's rejection of a six-cent offer . Hopes for Peace That and the bitterly tougnt meat strike , it is hoped , will end the current labor-management tension ? aggravated by rising living costs ? and bring the electrical , steel , and other industries into voluntary agreement . The GM agreement accentuates a gradually diminishing trend in the size of major postwar wage settlements . Round one came in the spring of 1946 after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage pattern . Round two brought a 15-cent pattern last year , but with fewer strikes . Round three , as nearly as anyone can judge now , promises to bring an approximately 10-cent hourly pattern of pay increases and at a relatively painless price , barring the meat strikes and the quiet Chrysler stoppage . Especially heartening to union leaders is the recognition 1- ? 11 ; " h the GM management 's bargaining group , headed by Harry W. Anderson , Vice-President in charge of labor relations , accorded the Bureau of Labor Statistic 's ' costof-living. index . Automatic Formula That and the fact that management not only agreed to grant workers a further three-cent wage boost next year but set up a formula ' of automatic one cent hourly raises tied to each change of 1.4 in the BLS cost-of-living index . The GM contract goes into effect May 28 and expires May 8 , 1950 . Mr. Anderson said the . ' : whole settlement was a result of an idea advanced by the corporation ? especially the cost-ofliving raise program . " It was explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood at 169.3 in April of this year . If the index rises ti 175 , the GM worker will receive an additional 10 cents besides the immediate flat 11-cent hike , Mr. Anderson said . Mr. Anderson said there was " no ceiling " on the increases possible , but also said the union had agreed that wages could go down as much as five cents in the same index proportion . 4 I September Adjustment Mr , Anderson said the first adjustment in cost of living will be after September of this year and will be based on the July index , which will not be available until August . A spokesman for the CIO United Electrical Workers , which represents 40,000 GM Electrical Division workers , said the company had made the same offer to them . Main provisions in the new General Motors-UAW , contract include : 1 . Eight-cents-an-hour wage increase representing the increase in the cost of living between 1940 and now , based on the consumer price index of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics . 2 . Three-cents-an-hour raise now as a so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 29 , 1049. 3 . Additional raises in the . ratio of one cent an hour for each 1.4 rise in the cost-of-living index . These adjustments to be made each quarter period with the first in the pay period after September , 1948 . There is no ceiling on the cost-of-living quarterly raise , but on the other hand , workers can lose up to five cents of the original eight cents if the cost of living index goes down . Other Provisions Other provisions include : Power of the l ? bor umpire extended : contract can not be reopened for two years ; company agreed to accept dues checkoff cards issued by the union ; union agreed to drop a petition for the union shop ; both agreed that if the National Labor Relations Board or the courts determine the company must negotiate on social security insurance , a joint union-company committee will be set up to study and report back before the next contract is signed . From Detroit , reports indicated that everybody iri the unit 's GM Departnient is elated over the agreement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in wages . Ford and Chrysler officials are studying the wage program which , if adopted by them , will add $220 , - 000,000 to the auto workers ' envelopes throughout the industry 's Big Three . Hope is expressed here that John L , Lewis and the coal operators will be favorably influenced by the GM agreement in drafting their 1948 contract which expires June 30 . Lewis Faces Court Right now Mr. Lewis must appear before Judge T. Alan Goldsborough in Federal District Court here June 1 to show cause why he should not bargain with the Southern ' Coal Association . Mr. Lewis took his United Mine Workers ' 200-man Negotiating Committee out of the wage talks last week when the southern operators insisted on being represented by a single bargaining agent . The National Labor Relations Board held that Mr. Lewis ' refusal to bargain with the southern group as a unit was an unfair labor practice and took court action to compel him to resume negotiations . All industry , not only management but labor , too , presumably will breathe easier when Mr. Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes , so goes the nation 's industry  --  including GM 's automatic cost-of-living wage rise .
