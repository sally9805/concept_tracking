 | A little less air with each breath and then finally no air at , all . And that would be the end of it . Die , die alone in this room . Then they 'd find him . Everybody scared to death , and most of all that old lady who had caused his death , she 'd be the sorriest one of all . She 'd go down on her knees to him and pray to him not to be really dead . That would fix her , all right . Aunt Martha ? ha ? Aunt Martha , she 'd just stand and cry . Aunt Martha 'd just stand and cry and would n't know what to do next . Aunt Martha was n't any good . The sun moved through the window and lay bright and hot on the back of the boy 's head . He moved . He lifted his face from the pillow . He sat up on the edge of the rumpled bed . He looked around the room , carefully , as if seeing it for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brown-painted fancy-carved woodwork , the wallpaper with the green up-and-down stripes and the pink-and-white appleblossoms growing right out of the stripes ? pretty . Frowning , he studied the fire-escape ' the state inspector had made Aunt Martha put in last year , the big knotted hayrope hanging coiled on its hook . He saw the painted washstand with its white pitcher and bowl , and above it the old mirror that made your face curl sideways when you looked in it ; and he left the bed and stood before the mirror . Then , feeling better , he looked around some more . The man who had the room today was awfully untidy . What if he 'd come back and catch him here ? Dwight listened . He could n't hear a thing . If he did come back Dwight could hear him coming and get away in time , he could hear him coming up the steps and he could hear him coming down the hall . He looked around . He was a pretty sloppy man , all right . Things were every which way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look . Nothing very interesting . Shaving brush lying in some old soapy water in the bottom of the washbowl . Long razor with some dried soap and dirty-looking little black hairs along the edge of it . Funny striped shirt over a chairback with an old stiff collar hanging from the neckband . Dwight wondered who it was that had the room ? Mr. Mendenhall or Mr. Hirschfield or Mr. Burdock or who ? maybe  | somebody he 'd never even seen . Things were sure in a mess . Suitcase spread out on the floor with things all rumpled and mixed-up in it . He looked at the things in the suitcase . He did n't find the pictures right away . They were hidden , kind of . The bottle was n't hidden , and he knew what it was because he 'd seen empty ones in the alley back of the hotel and Beanie 'd told him what they were . The bottle was n't hidden , and it was half full , and the liquid was pretty when he held it up to the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of pocket you had to unsnap and reach into . He brought them out into the light , and crouched there beside the old leather suitcase looking at them . It was like that , as simple as that . He was down on his knees by the suitcase and before he knew what he had done he had the pictures in his hands and suddenly everything was still and quiet as death and there was nothing anywhere in the world , Inside or Outside , but the pictures . And he crouched deep and alone in that silence , looking , looking , looking at the pictures , looking forever at the pictures that had now at last answered Beanie Barnes 's question . He almost did n't hear them coming in time . The footsteps were right at the door , it seemed , and he had barely time to stuff the pictures back underneath something in the suitcase and make a dive for the bed , where he tried to lie as he had lain before , centuries before , before the pictures , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody opened the door and came over and placed a gentle hand on his shoulder . He looked up , trying to make tears in his eyes . It was Aunt Martha . Aunt Sarah Stiles stood in the doorway . Aunt Martha lifted him up to a sitting position and put her arms around him . He wanted to shove them away , but he did n't . He saw her red eyes and her puffy cheeks and then he got some tears in his own eyes . He made his chin quiver a little . It was n't hard . Aunt Martha 's been looking for you everywhere , dear . We were worried . ' Her voice was shaky and gentle and he wanted to push her away . Where have you been ? Why are you crying ? Do you hurt anywhere ? You 're not feeling sick , are you ? ' He heard the rising panic in her voice . He thought a quick second before he spoke .  | ' Do n't feel very good , ' he said , sobbing , watching Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a little sick . ' He watched the old lady . ' When you feel bad you should always let Aunt Martha know right away . And you should n't come upstairs unless I 'm up here working , then it 's all right . You know I 've told you never to come up here , do n't you ? ' ' What ? ' The old lady 's eyes were going all over the room . ' You know I 've told you not to come up here alone . Say it so Aunt Sarah can hear you . ' ' I guess so , ' he said . ' I guess I know it . I was just looking for you . ' ' Why would you look up here for me , dear ? Why did n't you look for Aunt Martha downstairs first ? ' He had to give Aunt Martha his attention for a moment . ' I guess because I knew you had n't made the beds up here yet and I thought you might be up here now making the beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I 'd lay down on this old bed . ' Aunt Sarah spoke then , and there was a hard triumph in her voice . It was Aunt Martha 's fault . She 'd made him look at her , and while he was looking at her the old woman had found out his secret . ' Martha Sinclair , ' the old bitch said , ' get that boy out of here . I want to show you something . ' But he was n't scared . He slid down off the bed and walked to the door . ' I 'll be downstairs if you want me , ' he said over his shoulder to Aunt Martha . He sat before the two women on a chair in the parlor . He saw that Aunt Martha looked ugly from so much crying and that she was frightened . He figured that maybe he was n't scared at all . He was n't a kid any longer , he knew something now . He pouted his lower lip . Aunt Sarah Stiles sat in the big Morris chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frown , her mouth clamped tight . She looked at him for a long time before she spoke . ' What were you doing in that room ? ' Aunt Martha tried to answer for him , giving him a little time . ' He was looking for me , he said so , he '  | ' Let me handle this . ' The old lady did n't even look at Aunt Martha . ' Answer me , boy . What were you doing in that room ? ' He managed to meet her eyes . ' Looking for Aunt Martha , like I said . ' ' You 're lying ! ' Aunt Martha , her voice a blurred quaver , said he had never , but Aunt Sarah did n't let him finish . ' Do you know what happens to boys who tell lies ? ' He shook his head , mute . ' They burn in hell . In hot flames . Fire underneath them and all over them for all eternity . What did you do in that room ? ' He looked at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He made his eyes round . There was no guile in them . ' I thought Aunt Martha was working up there and I went up to look for her and then I got a kind of funny feeling and I laid down on that old bed and rested . ' ' Do you feel all right now , dear ? ' Aunt Martha asked . Do n't you want Aunt Martha to have Doctor Lovett come and look at you ? ' ' I do n't feel funny now . I guess it went away . ' ' Pah ! ' Aunt Sarah Stiles said . ' Of course it went away . He 's lying and he knows it , I can see through him , he 's a Craig all right , may God forgive us . ' A grimace of pain twisted her old mouth . ' Listen to me , boy , your immortal soul 's in danger . You went up there to look at those pictures , did n't you ? You 've done it before , too , have n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this place has probably taken you up there himself and showed them to you , has n't he ? ' He kept his mouth tight shut . She turned her eyes on Aunt Martha . ' Who has that room ? I 'll have to have a talk with him . ' ' I do n't know , oh , I do n't know , I ca n't think , ' Aunt Martha moaned , rocking a little in her chair . ' We 'll find out about it , ' Aunt Sarah Stiles said to the boy , her voice rising . ' You better make a clean breast of it , we 're going to find out the truth all right . ' He clenched his teeth . And even as he sat there , cringing a little from the violence in Aunt Sarah 's voice , the pictures were with him , deep Inside , white and secret . He was alone with them again .  | Aunt Sarah Stiles crossed to him in three violent strides , and she had her hands on his shoulders . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairback , crack . He yelled , and kicked at her . Aunt Martha came then . And the boy sat for a quiet moment deepalone on the chair , watching the hard struggle of the aunts ' hands above him , hearing the women 's heavy breathing , the only sound in the strange silence of the struggle ? and then he got out of there , got out of there fast . He got right out of there . And then was alone in the cob-shed . He was alone in the cob-shed , the door closed , the sun piercing through the cracks in the walls like a dozen slow-dancing swords , the sun clean and straight and sharp on lazily floating dust . He buried himself in cobs to the waist , and waited . Sank into the Inside , but not with Buffy and Muff . After a long time Aunt Martha came to him there . He did n't want her around , but there was no way he could keep her out . She sat down beside him , sort of hunched-up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she looked terrible . Her face was red and swollen and when she spoke her voice was shaky . He let her talk , it was all right with him . She said Aunt Sarah Stiles wanted to take him away with her to the City to live , to live there with her all the time , but Aunt Martha said she was his legal guardian and she was n't going to let anything like that happen . She would die if Dwight went away , and Dwight did n't want to go away , did he ? Dwight shook his head , not looking at her . Aunt Martha said maybe , though , she 'd have to let him go sometime in the summer , maybe she 'd have to , but not for always . Dwight got a little scared again at that , because he remembered how the old lady 'd tried to manhandle him , and he said he was n't going . Then Aunt Martha put her arm around him , and said he did n't have to worry about it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , and if he ever did go she 'd make Aunt Sarah Stiles promise not to hurt him . But maybe he would have to go for perhaps a week , or something like that , maybe two weeks , next summer , because Aunt Sarah Stiles was his aunt after all , and she thought Aunt Sarah Stiles meant well enough .  | Dwight looked at her . Did you hurt her ? he wanted to know . Did you kill her ? Aunt Martha began to cry , then , and Dwight quit looking at her . She said she guessed she 'd done something awful . Then she said no , she had n't either , that if she had n't interfered Aunt Sarah Stiles would have hurt him , hurt him badly , Aunt Sarah Stiles had acted as if she had n't known what she was doing . But Aunt Sarah was good , too , she was religious and good , and maybe better than she , Aunt Martha , could ever be . She did n't know . And , oh , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sorry , sorry , sorry , that Dwight had to see it . She wiped her eyes . She asked Dwight to promise that he 'd forget everything that had happened . Then Aunt Martha wiped her eyes some more and took him by the hand and asked him if he had always told her the truth . He nodded his head . ' Even about ? up in that room ? ' He nodded his head again . ' You did n't ? look at anything up there , did you ? ' ' Look at what , Aunt Martha ? ' he wanted to know . I did n't look at anything . I guess there was n't very much in that old room to look at . I just felt kind of funny and laid down on that old bed for a while and waited for you to come and get me . ' ' I know , dear , ' Aunt Martha said , and pressed his hand , hard . ' I know that 's all you did , and I know I can always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , after a while . What is it , dear ? ' When do I have to go away to stay with that old lady ? ' ' I do n't know , dear , ' Aunt Martha said . Not for a long time . Maybe next summer , but only for a little while . Maybe sometime next summer , but you do n't have to worry about it now . ' ' I 'm glad , ' he said . And then , suddenly , he smiled at her . ' What did you think I was doing up in that old room ? ' he asked , smiling .  | THE THREE-QUARTERS FACE WAS BETTER THAN THE PROFILE . AUNT MARTHA knelt beside the boy under the hot sun on the hard uneven bricks of the depot platform and hugged him to her convulsively , and then the conductor spoke to her and she gave the boy a last squeeze and Dwight felt her hot tearstained face against his for a long moment before the conductor boosted him up onto the platform of the coach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to keep the tears back ; and as the train jerked into motion he saw Aunt Martha , blurred by his anguish , white and mournful in the hot sun on the platform , and , above her head and behind her , the old dirty-yellow frame building , bigger than anything else in his life , with CRAIG HOUSE in large faded brown block letters on the weather-worn clapboards . He would have got off the train then , but it was already in fast motion and Aunt Martha and the hotel were gone and he saw the stockyards rush past and the last street of the town oddly small and unfamiliar ; and then the farms of the prairie , green wheat , long fine lines of small green cornstalks , whirling against the train like a wheel spoked with barbed-wire fences . The afternoon was long , the old coach sickly-smelling of unwashed bodies and the debris of ancient lunches taken from shoeboxes , the  | heat intense . The boy was afraid of his traveling companions , miserable in his red plush seat ; suffered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go about getting a drink , held his water until he hurt inside because he was ashamed to ask about the closet ; wondered if he would ever see Aunt Martha again , wondered if there would be a train-wreck , frantically wondered what shape the dangers ahead would take . When the train pulled into the big station in the City he sat stiff in his seat , afraid even to look out the window ; and then he was aware of a man standing in the aisle beside him . The man spoke twice before Dwight dared to look up at his face , which was pasty white and weak and somehow pretty-looking around the mouth and chin . You Dwight Craig ? ' The lips moved softly above a high stiff collar dirty at the edge where it touched the neck , wilted in streaks by sweat , held together by a narrow white wash-tie with a faded green design . Brassy-looking stickpin just below the knot . Coat over his arm , stiff straw hat pushed back on his head . ' Hey , boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm your Uncle Fred . ' The boy stared at him . ' Not your honest-to-gosh uncle ? your Aunt Sarah 's son-in-law . Flora , that 's my wife , she 's your blood cousin . But you better call me Uncle Fred . Well , what we waitin ' for ? ' The boy sat quiet for a rigid moment , then spoke . ' Got to go to the closet . ' ' You got to go where ? ' ' Closet . ' Lips closed tightly over the word . ' Closet , closet ? what closet ? ' His eyes traveled over the boy , took in the way he was sitting , body contorted , knees tight together . His face cleared suddenly , simultaneously assuming an expression of pious understanding that Dwight found familiar , and he spoke in a low conspiratorial voice . ' I guess you mean you got to go to the toilet . ' When the boy still did n't move he spoke again , the mask of ashamed propriety briefly broken . ' Say , boy , you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he pulled Dwight out of his seat and got him started  | down the aisle of the empty coach : Closet , closet . By Golly , it 's been a dickens of a long time since I heard it called that . You 'll have to get over usin ' hick words like that up here in the City . ' He felt battered and torn by the City on the short walk to the streetcar stop ? but even then beneath his fright there was the beginning of fascination in the impressions that assaulted his senses so confusingly : the pavement and cartracks and trolley cables , the clustered white globes of the streetlamps , the sweet-and-rotten smell of hot asphalt , the loud motor-noises , the cool swish of a slow-moving street sprinkler , the shrill incomprehensible language shouted by the brazen-throated newsboys , the whistles blown by the angry-faced policemen in their blue uniforms , and the crowds , the pushing crowds everywhere , men and women , soldiers and civilians , madly rushing every-which-way , bumping into each other , bumping into him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first experience , to make Bethesda and Aunt Martha and Craig House shrink to shameful meanness in the memory . There were questions he wanted to ask Uncle Fred , but the man seemed to be in as frantic haste as everyone else , pulling him through the crowds by the hand , dodging , side-stepping , sometimes stopping completely only to find an opening and rush on again , tugging at the boy 's hand , so that obviously it was no time for questions . They had to run at the last to catch their streetcar , and then Dwight found himself in a press of men in the conductor 's compartment at the rear of the car , and it was so crowded he thought he could n't breathe and then he was separated from Uncle Fred and in his panic pushed this way and that against the hard unyielding men around him until one of them laid a rough hand on him and told him to hold his horses . But it was all right because by that time he 'd got his eyes on Uncle Fred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the crowd thinned out a little , and after that he was n't afraid any longer and was kept busy simply watching the City move past outside the open window of the car , holding on to the horizontal brass protecting rods ? immense City , endless City , for they had been carried a mile now , two miles , maybe as much as four miles , and still the City lay about them and seemed to stretch ahead .  | And then Uncle Fred mumbled at the conductor and the conductor touched a finger to the visor of his round hard straw cap and gave his leather bell-strap a vigorous pull and the car slowed and stopped and they were in the street again . There was still pavement , it was still the City , but it was n't so noisy here and the buildings were a long row of dark frame dwellings built incredibly close together on parched-looking lawns that rolled in steep terraces down to the sidewalk . It was still the City , but the only person Dwight saw in his first look about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sidewalk with a canvas bag slung over his shoulder , hurling folded newspapers at high wooden porches with cocksure accuracy . He looked at the boy , and then he looked at the streetcar as it moved screechingly away from them , and he saw the trolley-wheel throw a dangerous-looking spark as it jumped the cable intersection at the corner , and , finally , he asked his first question . Uncle Fred , what makes the spark ? ' ' What 's that ? ' Dwight looked up at him . His voice was different ? a good deal less friendly than it had been in that embarrassing minute back on the train . I mean ? the spark on those wires where that stick goes on them up from the streetcar . ' Electricity , ' the man said shortly . Whatever it was , the man 's mood communicated itself to the boy , and suddenly he remembered where they were going , he remembered the angry-eyed old lady whom shortly he was going to see , he remembered the way she had looked at him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hotel parlor a little less than a year ago ; and then he thought he hated the City , and , walking alongside Uncle Fred , silent and now slow-paced enough , he longed for the hotel and Aunt Martha with all his soul . They turned in at a square brown box of a house with a deep screened-in front porch , so indistinguishable from the other houses in the block that Dwight wondered , had enough attention for it to wonder , how Uncle Fred had managed to turn in at the right one , unless maybe he counted them off from the corner and got it that way , or ? and then he saw the metal numbers screwed into a clapboard  | above the screen door of the porch . But there was n't time to contemplate the wonder of that for now Uncle Fred was holding the door for him , and now they were on the porch behind the black screen , and now they had passed through an open door into a long dark hallway and stood at the foot of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaping gas there , a smell Dwight quickly learned to like , to associate with the City and the ways of the City , but which now was simply another element in the strangeness with which he was surrounded . Uncle Fred disengaged his hand ? a little roughly , since the boy had been holding it so desperately  --  and hung his hard straw hat on the fancy-carved hallrack with the dim smoky mirror ; took Dwight 's cloth cap , placed it on a lower hook , and without speaking pushed the boy ahead of him , not up the stairs , but through a door at their left into a large parlor that seemed crowded with furniture . Aunt Sarah Stiles sat in a high-backed thronelike armchair by a window on the far side of the room . A large Bible lay in her lap , and as Dwight stood there he saw her lips moving carefully over the words . When she finished the verse , she looked up . Spoke . ' You were a long time getting here . ' ' The train was late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast as we could . By gracious , we even run to catch the streetcar . ' Through his own unhappiness Dwight heard the whine in the man 's voice . Pah , the old lady said ? or bah  --  an exhalation of breath forced through suddenly parted lips . ' Well , child , come here  --  do n't stand there like a fool . ' He picked his way to her cautiously through the room 's dark jungle of furniture . Felt her arm around him , her dry hard lips on his forehead , and heard her speak again . You 're here with me now for a while , young man . I must say it 's high time . ' Then , abruptly , her proud old face beneath its high crown of white hair tightening in holy determination : ' We 'll pray to the Father . ' With a great cracking of joints and creaking of stays and rustle of poplin she got from the chair to her knees on the floor , pulling the boy down with her , and lifted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our Heavenly Father , ' she began in a rich  | passionate voice , ' we kneel to ask your forgiveness for our sins on this long difficult day . Extend your loving grace to my brother 's boy , help him in his struggle against his dark inheritance ? strengthen me , oh , Father , for the task ahead . Guide this whole family in the way of Christ , who came to redeem us from evil , and in whose holy Name I deliver this supplication , amen , amen . ' ' Boy , this is your cousin Flora . ' ' Hello , Dwight . ' She was a pretty young woman with dark brown eyes and pale yellow hair wrapped around her small head in heavy shining braids , but there was an air of shrinking apology in her manner and something furtive in her eyes . Her loose calico housedress hung straight and shapeless about her small figure . ' Hello . ' ' Show the boy to his room . ' The old lady lifted the heavy Bible from the table beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room by Flora 's hand gentle on his shoulder . Uncle Fred had left the boy 's small straw suitcase in the hall , and now Flora took it and started up the stairs , the boy following her , and then they were on the landing and Flora waited for him to catch up and smiled a little and placed a hand upon his shoulder , and together they mounted to the second floor of the house , the boy feeling a little better now because of the friendly arm across his shoulders . His bedroom contained a narrow single bed covered by a worn patchwork quilt , a wooden cane-bottom rocking-chair that stood by the tall limplace-curtained window , and a low green-painted dresser ; and those three pieces of furniture looked crowded in the small high-ceilinged room . The plain plaster walls had been finished with light-green kalsomine , and an unframed lithograph portrait of John Wesley was tacked to the wall over the head of the brown wooden bed . ' It 's a nice little room for a boy , ' Flora said in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall . Then there 's mamma 's room at the front , and Doctor Willoughby 's room . And this is your room , this is going to be your room . ' Dwight sat in the chair , sat on the edge of it , uncertainly . ' A doctor ? ' he asked , his eyes on the woman 's face . ' There 's a doctor ? '  | Flora smiled at him . ' Not the kind you think . Doctor Willoughby 's in the University , he teaches the young ministers who come to study and then go out to preach in our church . He rents the front room across the hall from mamma . ' Dwight rocked , and looked out the open window , and then back at Flora . ' There 's chickens down there , ' he said . ' They 're mamma 's chickens . Plymouth Rocks and some white Leghorns . And Fred has a little garden , and last week he got a gunnysack and filled it with cobs and things and made a bagswing for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When you go to the bathroom you can see it from there . ' ' I got a bagswing at home , ' Dwight said . ' How can you have chickens in the city ? ' Flora giggled a little . ' That 's what the neighbors wanted to know , but when mamma makes up her mind to a thing she just goes ahead and does it . I guess she 'd even have a cow if she wanted to have a cow . Was it fun on the train ? ' ' I guess so , ' Dwight said . ' I guess it was . ' ' Fred and I went to Chicago when we were married . Chicago was so big it scared me , but I liked going on the train . ' ' Chicago ? Is it bigger than here ? ' ' Oh , a whole lot bigger . I guess in comparison with Chicago this is just a little old hick town . ' Dwight thought about it . ' I like cities , ' he said finally . ' We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Fred and I. We like to take rides on the streetcar and go window-shopping and things like that . You 've got to get ready for dinner now , though . Mamma does n't like it when people are late for dinner . ' She put his suitcase on the quilted bed and opened it for him and laid out a clean shirt , and as he sat watching her he wanted to ask how dinner could be at night but he remembered Uncle Fred calling him a hick and he did n't want to give himself away a second time . She showed him to the bathroom and he sniffled a little when the door was closed behind him and he was afraid he had broken something when he pulled the toilet-chain and heard the great coughing rush of water in the stool . He washed his face and hands and went back to  | his room and put on the shirt Flora had laid out for him , and when he got downstairs again Flora heard him and came to him in the parlor and took him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the brown oatmeal paper above it . There was a strange man at the place to the right of Aunt Sarah , who sat at the head of the table opposite her son-in-law . Dwight , this is Doctor Willoughby , who lives with us here . He teaches the word of God at the University . You 're late . Close your eyes for grace . ' Doctor Willoughby asked God to bless the food and to bless the people who were about to partake of the food and to bless the University both students and faculty , and Dwight found himself fascinated by the way Doctor Willoughby pronounced his words , and after he had finished and Flora had helped Dwight to the food on the table the boy could n't keep from staring at Doctor Willoughby . He had a round , white , moist-looking face and pale hands with long fluttery fingers that moved restlessly about his collar , his coat lapels , his heavy yellow watch-chain ? thin fingers that seemed to assist in shaping the very words he spoke . He wore a dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front in sharp points that were like weapons , and when he moved his head the edge of his standup collar left a fine red line upon his throat . When he talked all his a 's sounded like ah or aw and he seemed unable to pronounce is when they came at the end of a word . ' So this , Sistah Stiles , is youah little nephew , one of the Lawd 's little gentlemen . Suffah little children , the Savyah said to his disciples , in one of his rebukes to those pooah men . Oh , ' ? and the man 's hands fluttered in a quick eloquent protest of firm orthodoxy ? ' oh , great devout souls , although of co'se limited , but great loyal souls , all except one , and even his crime was a neces'ry paht of the Divine Plan . Mind you , one does not extend charity to Judas , but one recognizes that his crime was foah-known and inevitable , according to the prophecy . Must one not recognize that , Sistah Stiles ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face . ' And he answered and said unto them , It is one of the Twelve , that dippeth with me in the dish . ' Doctor Willoughby 's right hand lowered a lightly laden fork quickly to the plate , left it there , went out toward  | Aunt Sarah in a half-gesture of innocence against the accusation of her tone ; was arrested in mid-air , flew to the weapon points of the white collar , was pricked , punished . The old lady 's voice , hard in timbre , rapid , harsh and flat in accent , continued , ' The Son of Man indeed goeth , as it is written of him : but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed . Good , good were it for that man if he had never been born . ' It was a voice thin and shrill with hatred . The last words were beaten out with a brown blue-veined hand on the white tablecloth . When she had finished , Dwight heard her breathing . Doctor Willoughby lifted his fork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fork halfway to his mouth and dropped with sharp little pellet-sounds to the plate . When he finally spoke it was to Dwight , and his voice was soft and trembly : Young man , youah awnt is the most remahkable woman of my acquaintance , the most remahkable memory for scriptuah it has evah been my good fortune to encountah . I 'm suah you will find youah life heah most ? instructive . ' Pah , the old woman said . Flora whispered to the boy to eat his dinner . He was on the streetcar with Flora and Uncle Fred . It was a warm evening , the windows in the car were open , and he and Flora sat up in front near the motorman with Uncle Fred behind them leaning over the back of their seat talking a blue streak . Flora did n't say much , but she and Dwight laughed a lot at the things Uncle Fred said . She held his hand , and Dwight knew when to laugh because Flora gave his hand a convulsive little squeeze every time Uncle Fred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Uncle Fred told them the motorman was mad at them and unless they quieted down he 'd make them get off the car when they went through niggertown and that would be the last Fred Jackson would ever see of them . For a while Dwight thought Uncle Fred meant it , and he sobered up in a hurry , but when he looked up at Flora and saw in her face that Uncle Fred was joking again it was even more fun , because he and Flora pretended to be frightened and pressed their lips together hard to keep from laughing , but they could n't , and the laughter  | forced its way out through their tight lips and made such a funny noise that the motorman finally did look around at them and for a second Dwight was frightened again . But the motorman showed yellow teeth in a quick broad grin , and Dwight and Flora quit trying to hold it back and screamed with laughter and the motorman clanged his bell six or seven times in quick succession and they had a fine time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything outside the car , but he guessed it was all right because , as Uncle Fred said , if he saw everything up this time there would n't be anything left for the way back , and besides , he might get sick to his see-er . It was enough just to be there , feeling the varnished wood of the windowsill against his bare forearm , letting the grinding vibration of the wheels put little shocks through his whole body , enjoying the flow of warm air moving across his face from the open window ahead , hearing the clang of the bell , watching the motorman sway with the motion of the heavy car as they gathered speed going downhill . When they got off the car downtown Dwight was weak inside from laughing so much , and they had to stand on the corner a while for him to get over the giggles . He could n't see why he had to get over them , but Uncle Fred and Flora were kind of solemn now that they were off the car and Dwight saw they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did the best he could , and before very long he was all right and they began to walk slowly down the street past the big stores , stopping now and then to look in the windows , and Dwight got so interested he probably could n't have laughed even if Uncle Fred had started walking on his hands or something . At first the boy simply stared with his mouth open at the beautiful things he saw in the shop windows : great blood-red stones and sparkling diamonds , heavy and elaborately worked silverware , fragilelooking china with delicate patterns in gold and silver and pale-blue and yellow and rose ; whole rooms set up and looking all ready to be lived in , bedrooms silky and feminine and soft , dining rooms with massive tables and the chairs in place and the places set and ready for serving , living-room interiors with warm shining draperies and deep upholstered chairs and davenports and splendid velvety oriental rugs ; fabrics draped from their standards in long sculptured folds ,  | solid-looking ; silk and satin and lace gowns on wax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine leather luggage , and a window of bright hammocks and lawn furniture , and a window of exciting supplies for hunting and fishing and tennis and baseball and golf ; and , finally , the automobiles . At first he simply stared , and then he wanted to know the cost of everything he saw . For a while Uncle Fred tried to answer all his questions , and the boy was lifted to a high realm of luxury that had not before existed for him . Eight hundred , nine hundred dollars for a rug , just for an old rug to walk on . ( Then how much would the worn and faded carpets in the hotel be worth ? Ten dollars ? Sevenfifty ? Five , maybe , or four ? ) A hundred dollars for a set of dishes . Three hundred-fifty for a little old ring so small it could hardly be seen . Ninety-eight-fifty for a woman 's dress , seventy-five for a suit of clothes . Most as much for that dress as I'n make in a month , ' Uncle Fred said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that happy evening by something angry in his voice . More for just a yard of that goods than I get to spend on shirts in a whole year . ' When they got to the automobiles , Dwight did n't like the way Uncle Fred sounded at all , and he was sorry because the new cars were so beautiful that he did n't want anything to spoil his pleasure in looking at them . They were as immaculate as the silverware he had seen in the jewelry shops , they stood on highly polished floors , and they all looked as swift and powerful as the wind . Dwight had n't even heard of some of them . He knew Studebaker and Dodge and of course the tin lizzies , and Chandler Six because Mr. Austin in Bethesda had bought one last year , but he had never before seen a Mitchell or a Cole Eight or a Scripps-Booth or a Moon Six . But Uncle Fred nearly spoiled it all . He read the words on the display signs and laughed at them unpleasantly and said angry things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a car ? " ' he read from a placard in the Overland window . " Should n't you have one NOW ? It will mean a bigger , broader , healthier , happier life for you and your family . " ' Uncle Fred laughed mockingly . Well , ai n't that nice now ? Bigger broader healthier and happier , yes-siree . Well , Mister Overland , that 's mighty thoughtful of you , and only six hundred and  | ninety-five dollars , too , a mere nothing , cheap as dirt . Are you without a car ? Oh , no , not on your tintype we 're not , we 're just out walkin ' for our constitutions , we ride on the nice streetcars just because it 's what we 'd rather do . ' Dwight tried not to listen to him . The automobiles were the most magnificent things he had seen , and he saw himself seated at the wheel of each one of them , dressed in the richest suit in town and wearing big expensive goggles and passing everything on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world beside him , laughing with her whenever they whizzed past a plodding old broken-down tin lizzie with a couple of country hicks in it , cutting corners at breakneck speed with the girl white-faced now and begging him to be more careful even if they were racing to save somebody 's life . He felt the speed and the power and the wealth and the love and the glory ; and he finally spoke aloud , cutting off Uncle Fred at the climax of his exasperated tirade . Some day I 'm going to own the most expensive car ever made . ' Uncle Fred looked down at him in astonishment . Flora pressed his hand nervously . Look who 's shootin ' off his mouth , ' Uncle Fred said . Dwight had forgotten ever having been afraid of anything . ' The best car you ever saw , and I 'll drive it faster than anybody , and have one of those expensive old suits we saw and a house full of all that furniture . ' Uncle Fred laughed , but not the way he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will , ' he said . ' Sure ' thing , you 'll grow up to be a regular millionaire . ' ' I will , ' the boy muttered stubbornly , pouting about it a little now . ' I will , you just wait and see . ' His life during that first visit to the City was divided between Aunt Sarah 's household , where he was usually miserable , and the City outside the house , which was infinitely exciting and desirable . The house was daily a battleground , the scene of Aunt Sarah 's unrelenting struggle with evil , and no one failed to feel the heat and desperation of the conflict . Her favorite weapon was sarcasm , her ringing high-pitched voice was always edged with it , and her talk  | was regularly punctuated with pah 's and other ejaculations of disapproval and contempt and hatred . Everyone in the house was furtive and guarded in her presence . Outside , Flora and Uncle Fred kidded and laughed and had a high old time ( except when Uncle Fred was in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the home Flora was a silent , nervous , unsmiling ghost of a woman and Uncle Fred went about with sullen mouth and hurt angry eyes . Most of the time Uncle Fred stayed out of Aunt Sarah 's way , working in his little garden or in Aunt Sarah 's chicken-pen , or chinning with the neighbors about the war and how he would enlist in a minute if he did n't have a family to support . Dwight heard him and saw the feverish excitement in the man 's face when he talked about going away to camp and sailing for France and seeing Paris with his buddies and getting a shot at the Kaiser . Delicious little thrills of patriotism and glory ran up and down Dwight 's spine when he heard Uncle Fred talk like that ( he had used some of the spending money Aunt Martha had given him to buy an it imitation-leather Sam Browne belt which he wore all the time ) ; and he never understood the look of woeful discouragement he saw in Flora 's face when sometimes she slipped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to him . In the house they had morning prayers every day before breakfast and Dwight was always singled out for special attention in the old lady 's monologues with the Heavenly Father . He dreaded those ordeals more than anything , more than weekly prayer meeting in the big church down by the university campus , more than the long Sunday services ; and of course he could never be honest with Aunt Sarah in the little personal quizzes she subjected him to each morning after prayers , because he knew inside that he was guilty of more deadly sins that any she could be aware of . But sometimes he saw such a horrible light of intelligence shining in her eyes that he feared she had guessed something of his crime ; and as the summer passed she increased her efforts for his salvation . More and more frequently she called the Lord 's attention to the filth and evil of the town the boy was growing up in , more and more she reminded Him of the father 's bad blood , until for Dwight in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stomach .  | But he made progress in the discipline of guile , learned to say promptly by instinct the things that were necessary to make Aunt Sarah believe that she and the Lord were having some success at last . During his last two or three weeks in the City he developed confidence , confidence in his own subtle science of subterfuge ; and it was fine because it made things a little easier in the house , and gave him , finally , a little more freedom . And he needed freedom desperately for the City outside the house . He hungered for it greedily , ached to devour it with his senses ; and what he was given on his streetcar excursions with Flora and Uncle Fred did little more than tantalize his appetite . He would sit on the front steps of the house at dusk watching the joyriders drive past and dreaming about what went on in those cars , where they were going , and what caused the free animal laughter that floated from them and lingered in his ears so long after it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street lived a family with two pretty daughters , and there were always soldiers with them on their front porch long after sundown . Once shortly after dark Dwight crept through the backyard of the intervening house and for a while lay in the shadows below that mysterious veranda where the Cooper girls sat with their young officers ; lay on his belly in the dark hardly daring to breathe , hearing the whispers and strange rustling noises above him , feeling the long portentous silences , reaching out from his hungry heart to the passion there he only half understood . The City was mystery and brutality and love and violence . In late July the mystery and the violence emerged with terrifying theatricality in the public hanging of three negroes at Camp Wood for rape . For a week the atmosphere of the City was thick with passion and hard brutal hatred , and on the day of the hanging it was said that twenty thousand people gathered on the hills around the camp to watch the spectacle through their telescopes and field-glasses . Aunt Sarah took notice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God to bring down his wrath upon Camp Wood , which she called the new Sodom . Flora and Uncle Fred discussed it with each other in furtive whispers when Dwight , they thought , was engrossed in a book across the room from them . Dwight himself got small graphic details  | of the crime from a neighbor boy , Charley Gates ; and in return Dwight told Charley about the pictures he had seen the summer before , tried to make the secret flesh that still burned in his memory as real and precious to Charley Gates as it would be forever to him . The pictures , and now the crime of the gallows ' three victims ; and the crime was envied , and on that hot afternoon of justice , when the hour for the springing of the trap struck at last , the boys suffered the rope , died with the men . Had sinned with them , now died with them , burned in hell with them for lust . The rope was a snake that now sometimes darkly gleamed in Dwight Craig 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Alice Kenworth , Aunt Sarah 's cousin , a picture they conspired to see together in secret defiance of the aunt . Alice Kenworth was a vivid , quick-moving young woman who always exhaled a faint sweet odor that seemed to come from the bright flowers of her soft summer dresses , a warm blonde with direct merry eyes and a laughing mouth who clerked in women 's wear at Garbstein 's Department Store , down at the kike 's , ' where before his death Sarah Stiles 's husband had worked as bookkeeper . Alice Kenworth was the only person who came regularly to the house who did not seem to be afraid of Aunt Sarah . The laughter came as freely from her strong throat inside the house as out . ' Of course we do n't have to go to a show , ' she said to him when they were safely on the streetcar . She laughed into his solemn upturned face , and he caught the breath of roses in his nostrils . ' I guess a show 's nothing much in your young life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't care one way or the other . ' He knew she was joking . What 's it about ? ' he asked . I do n't know exactly , but it 's got a good name . Theda Bara 's in it . I do n't know , maybe you 're too young to be going to see Theda Bara . ' At home I go to see shows all the time , ' Dwight said . He dared to look at her . There 's always a pretty girl in them , ' he said , manly and direct about it . Wait 'll you see Theda , ' Alice Kenworth said . ' Oo-la-la , that Theda . ' Then she looked solemn , and Dwight could n't tell whether she was joshing again or not . Gee , I do n't know , maybe it 's wrong for a kid to go at that . I guess I did n't think . I guess we could go out to  | Lakeview Beach instead ? it 's all right for you to go out there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there sometimes , do n't they ? ' He had to show his panic a little . ' I wo n't tell Aunt Sarah . She wo n't find out , I wo n't ever tell her . ' Okay , okay , ' the woman said . We 'll go through with it . I guess I 'd be a piker to back out now . ' He sat beside her in the dark theater and it was like nothing that had ever happened to him before . Safe in the darkness of the theater , safe beside warm Alice Kenworth , the boy submitted to the authority of the actress , the woman with the heavy passionate mouth and the full sinuous body and the sly suggestive mannerisms . It was he who was the reckless victim of Theda Bara 's poisonous lips , he whose hands caressed her shoulders , her smooth back , in the long embraces , and he finally who was ruined by her ; and he knew at last that it was worth the desperate price . He exulted in that , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his way of rejoicing with the evil woman for her triumph over himself . He remembered Alice Kenworth , and looked up at her as the lights came on in the theater , and smiled his tremulous secret straight into her shining eyes . She laughed a little , and if Theda Bara could have laughed for him it would have sounded like that . She laid her hand on his arm and gave it a quick little squeeze ; and it was the touch of Theda Bara 's own hand . The movie was a rich source of fantasy for him for months after he had returned to drab Bethesda . He dreamed of it ; and in the following summers found ways of making his own secret trips to the forbidden shows downtown . His desires were given shape by those shadow images for years ; and because there was always guilt in it , guilt in the careful calculated secrecy of it , the rope remained . There were times in his dreams when the trap was sprung beneath his feet before his fearful hand could touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University in the warm evening with Flora and Uncle Fred . He looked at the ivy-covered walls . ' What 's it like to go here ? ' he wanted to know . What do you have to do when you go to college ? '  | Study a lot of books , ' Uncle Fred said wisely . They met three young women who looked older , more maturely poised , than Flora , walking arm-in-arm in their pale organdy dresses . ' Read your old head off , all the time . ' Behind them they heard a soft evening melody of laughter . Wear your eyes out reading . ' ' I already read a lot , ' Dwight said . ' I 've read Chip of the Flying U and Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle and Boy Scouts in Nicaragua and stories in the American Boy where it tells about Mark Tidd . When I 'm home I read more than anything else . ' Seems like I never get time to read anything , ' Flora said . An older man approached them , gray-haired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cane . Flora was self-consciously silent until he had passed . ' That was one of the teachers , ' she whispered . ' Some day Dwight 'll come to Slade and maybe get to be as smart as he is , wo n't you , Dwight ? ' ' I suppose so , ' Dwight said . Did you ever go here ? ' They walked past the Conservatory . From the open windows of the practice rooms came a weird counterpoint of dissonance . ' Did you and Uncle Fred ever go here ? ' Uncle Fred laughed , sounding a little the way he did when he was in one of his bad moods . ' Oh , sure , ' he said . ' I 'm a son of the idle rich and I came here for four years and belonged to one of these frats and everything . That 's the reason I 'm making so much money right now. , Fred , ' Flora said in her thin sad voice . Please , Fred . ' ' Well ! ' the man said angrily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Building . A pipe glowed in the deeper dusk of its high entrance portico . ' They 're not supposed to smoke around here , ' Fred said in a shrill voice . ' No smoking on the Methodist campus . ' Please , honey . ' I 'd like to smoke a pipe myself . I 'd like to have a little fun , but I guess I never will . I guess I never will as long as  --  ' Fred ! ' All right , all right . ' The lights came on inside the Library . That 's where they go to  | work , ' Flora said to Dwight . ' Some day you 'll be in there working with all the rest of them . A regular college man . ' She looked at her husband , saw his melancholy face . ' It 's nice to have advantages , ' she said . ' It 's nice to be able to go to college and have things ? nice . ' ' I do n't know whether I want to or not , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up my mind yet . ' ' You 'll get it made up for you , ' Uncle Fred said . ' Your mind 'll be made up for you whether you like it or not . ' ' I guess if I do n't want to I wo n't have to , ' Dwight said darkly . ' When I get old enough I guess I wo n't let them boss me around . ' A young fellow in white flannels and sneakers overtook them silently and passed them , grinning . He carried a ukelele , and a dozen steps ahead of them he struck two soft chords from it . ' I guess maybe I 'll decide to go to college , though . I 'm not going to be a hick all my life . ' ' Of course you 'll want to go to college , ' Flora said . They descended the half-dozen steps from the campus down into the street . ' It 's the only way you can amount to anything in this day and age . ' She and Dwight discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 As luck would have it the kitchen clock was slow and of course the five-fifteen would pick that particular day to be on time , so that when she heard the train 's first whistle she was just finishing up the pies she was making for Sunday . Minnie was out getting coal , and Aunt Martha called to her to put the pies in ; and washed her hands and gave a swipe at her face , flung her apron over a chair and rushed out through the office and into the street . The train whistled again , and she had to use all her will-power to keep from running the half-block to the depot . The train was held up at the edge of town while they backed the late afternoon freight into the siding . Aunt Martha thought maybe the boy would get off out there , the way Bethesda people sometimes did , and she started walking rapidly down the track to meet him ; but before she 'd gone more than a block the freight was clear of the  | main track and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn and run back to the platform . She got there just as the train came to a stop , and her heart was pounding rapidly from the exertion and it was hard to get her breath and there were little black spots floating before her eyes ; but it did n't matter , for through her dizziness she saw the boy briefly at the coach window and then he was coming down to her on the platform carrying his small suitcase and at last she had her arms around him . She was unaware of everything but his being there and she held him tight and did n't want ever to let him go ; but then she felt him pushing at her with his hands and a quick pain shot through her and she had to release him . She saw the boy 's white face vaguely through her tears , and behind him , staring at them with grins on their faces , the conductor and Mr. Banyon the depot agent and Joe Silvers who met all the trains with his dray wagon . And she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , felt him looking at her strangely with the rest of them . She clutched at his suitcase and took Dwight 's hand and started swiftly toward the hotel . After a moment or two Dwight withdrew his hand . She looked down at him timidly , almost afraid to speak , for she did n't know whether she could control her voice or not , and she knew now that he wanted things to be natural and casual . ' Did ? did you have a nice time at Aunt Sarah 's , dear ? ' She saw him swagger . ' I guess so . ' ' Did you miss Aunt Martha ? did you miss me ? ' ' I guess so . ' They passed the east corner of the hotel . ' Are ? are you glad to be back home ? ' ' Sure ? I guess I am . ' They went into the hotel through the parlor entrance . She tried to keep him in the parlor , but he was distant and uncommunicative and finally he announced he was going out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she asked , as she had always done . ' Oh , just around . ' She started to press him , but then she saw the beginning of a pout  | around his mouth and she could n't stand the thought of any unpleasantness on this first day . She let him go , and from the bedroom window saw him wandering aimlessly around the backyard . She sighed , and went to the kitchen to help Minnie with the preparations for supper . Before very long he came and stood inside the kitchen door . Where 's old Beanie ? ' Aunt Martha saw Minnie open her mouth to answer him , but she managed to speak first . Ralph is n't here any more , dear . ' Why not ? ' ' He ? had to go away . ' ' Go away ? Clear away ? ' Well , not clear away , but ? just away from here . Just away from the hotel . ' ' Why ? I want to see him . ' He 's too old for you to play with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to play with you before supper . I saw his mother this morning and told her you 'd be home and said you 'd probably want to see Charles right away . ' What would I want to see him for ? Why 'd Beanie go away ? ' Minnie Schuyler picked up the big potato masher , and , holding it like a bludgeon , turned to confront him . ' He got fired , kid . We 're gon na try to get a little work outa you around here from now on . That is , if you ai n't got too cityfied for folks like us . ' Martha Sinclair addressed her nephew , speaking rapidly . ' He did n't get fired at all , it just seemed as if there was n't enough to keep him busy the way things have been falling off , and he was getting so big , almost like a man , that he could make more money doing farm work . It wo n't make any difference to you , dear . Maybe once in a while you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel you want to . ' Bang , went the potato masher in the big black iron pot , and the boy flinched . Then , finally , to his aunt : ' Wait tables ? ' Minnie spoke viciously over her shoulder . ' Sure , wait tables , you think you 're too good for that ? ' She punished the potatoes in the pot . And bring in coal and cobs and sweep out and help upstairs and mow the lawn and chop kindling and go to the store for victuals . ' ' Minnie ! '  | ' Well , it 's time the little snipe 's learnin ' where his bread ' n ' butter comes from , an ' if he do n't maybe there wo n't be no bread ' n ' butter . Good Lord ' I wo n't have you using such language . ' ' You mean good Lord ? Ha ! ' She th gave the wooden masher a thump against the side of the pot and threw it down angrily on the zinc top of the old table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' She repeated it affectedly , mincing . ' Heavens-to-Betsy , you 'd think he was the Dook of Bilgewater or somethin ' . Why n't you tell him this place is goin ' to rack an ' ruin , an ' even so there 's more'n two people'n do even if they worked round the clock , an ' I guess we 're about doin ' exactly that . You 're goin ' to work all right , young man . An ' you'n start right now by fillin ' up the coalbuckets . ' He stood rooted by the door . Aunt Martha opened the oven to look at the pies , looked without seeing them , and crossed quickly to the boy and took him outdoors into the yard . ' Do n't pay any attention to her , dear . ' ' Wha 'd she mean ? ' Nothing , dear . Look , I had Mr. Raynard come and put up a horizontal bar for you to play on so you can get big muscles and be strong and healthy . ' ' Would I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' Would I get money the way Beanie did ? And have it for myself ? ' ' I do n't want you to work unless you 're sure you want to . Aunt Martha and Minnie can get along all right . I want you to have a good time and do a lot of studying when school starts , and ' ' I 'll wait tables . ' ' You do n't have to unless you ' I 'll wait tables , but I wo n't let that old Minnie boss me around . She 's just an old country hick . ' ' Dwight ! ' ' Well , I wo n't let her ' ' We 'll talk about it later . ' His face was sullen for a moment before he spoke again . ' How much will I get ? '  | What ? ? ' ' How much will I get for waiting on tables ? ' ' We 'll see . ' ' Well . ' He looked around the yard with careless worldly eyes . ' I think I 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do downtown ? ' ' Nothing . I just want to go down there . ' ' But do n't you want to ? ? ' ' I guess I can go downtown if I want to . I 'm old enough . ' She had to let him go . After supper , when the dishes were done and Minnie had gone out somewhere and the hotel was quiet , Aunt Martha found the boy sitting alone on the low narrow porch in front of the office . Deathly tired ; and still so much to do . The ironing , and the silverware needed scouring , and the dining-room floor should be scrubbed , and Miss Hancock had said there was something wrong with her windowblind , and ? but let it wait . Let it all wait . And she would n't make a drudge out of the boy when he was still just a child ( and looking more like poor Rosemary all the time , not at all like him )  --  still just a child , and children should n't have to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resentful , and especially in a hotel , where you could never tell what ' It sure seems funny to be where there are just dirt streets and no streetcars and stuff like that . It sure does . ' He spoke gruffly , trying to keep his voice low , trying to act like a man . He sat with his hands in his pockets , leaning back in his chair , his legs crossed . ' Why does it seem funny ? It 's your home , it 's where you 've always lived . I should think the City 'd be where it would seem funny . I 'm sure when I was there I was frightened nearly to death . ' ' Well , ' he said judiciously , ' I suppose a woman would feel like that ? leastwise if you had n't been there much . For a man it 's a lot different . ' ' Oh , I suppose it is , for a man , ' Aunt Martha said , allowing herself the least little bit of irony .  | ' Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean , dear ? ' ' Why do we call it supper ? It is n't supper , it 's dinner . ' Dinner 's at noon , ' she said . ' At night it 's supper . ' He contradicted her . ' It is n't either . It 's lunch at noon . Supper 's dinner . ' ' I guess it 's just what we 've always called it . I guess it does n't make much difference . ' ' After this we better call it lunch and dinner . ' ' All right , dear , if you like it better . Only perhaps it had better be just between you and me . Minnie 's always lived here and she might make fun of us if she heard us putting on airs . ' ' That old Minnie ! ' ' Dwight ! ' She paused a minute , and when she continued her voice was tense . ' Aunt Martha could n't get along without Minnie here to help . Minnie 's the only one left . ' His lower lip was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spoke again . ' Yes , siree , it sure does look funny around here . When I get big I 'm going to live in a city all the time ? a city big as Chicago , maybe . You know what I been thinking ? Well , there are prob'ly hundreds and thousands of people who never been to the City all their lives . How many times have you ? ' ' Once , ' she said . ' A long time ago , when I was a little girl . ' ' Did you have lots of fun ? ' ' I guess  --  well , I guess I was just kind of ? afraid . ' ' Afraid ? ' There was a vast contempt in his voice . ' Afraid of what ? ' Why , like I said , so many people , and ' I like to be where there 's lots of people , and big cars and soldiers all over everywhere and them old yellow icewagons ' Those . ' and shows and people dressed up all the time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . ' ' What about your Aunt Sarah , dear ? You have n't said anything about her . ' She saw him stiffen a little in his chair . ' What about her ? ' ' I mean  --  how is she ? Was she nice to you ? '  | ' I guess she 's all right . ' ' Did you show her what a good boy you are ? ' ' I guess so . ' ' You were a good boy , were n't you , dear ? All the time ? You did n't do anything you would n't want to tell me about , did you ? ' ' I guess not . What would there be to do ? ' ' Nothing , dear ? but Aunt Martha could n't help worrying about you . Were there any other nice boys for you to play with ? ' ' No , I guess not . ' ' Did you like Flora and her husband ? ' ' Well , I guess they 're kind of old stick-in-the-muds . ' ' Dwight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm sure they would n't say things like that about you . Were n't they nice to you ? ' ' I guess they were all right . ' He looked at her quickly , and she saw him turn something over in his mind ? it was almost a physical gesture . When he spoke his voice was a little lower , and guarded . ' The one I like is old Alice Kenworth . ' Aunt Martha 's heart sank ? the boy was thinking about girls already . She had to find out . ' Who is Alice Kenworth ? ' ' Oh , she 's just a cousin of Aunt Sarah 's . ' Cousin ? no girl , then , probably , someone older . ' Tell me about her . ' The boy 's face was solemn . ' She 's just about the prettiest woman you ever saw , and she works downtown and wears fine clothes all the time and has a lot of fun . She 'd take me places and pretend I was her fellow . ' ' Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies and things like that . ' ' Did she take you to shows a lot ? ' ' Well , just every once in a while , that 's all . I wish she 'd come down here and see us . I guess I 'll go in and write old Alice a letter and ask her to come down . ' He got to his feet , opened his mouth in a great yawn , and stretched prodigiously . He did n't look at Aunt Martha , but his eyes brushed the old hotel briefly and critically . ' I guess first , though , we better give this old house a coat of paint . And we better have electric lights put in instead of those old lamps . I guess  | we better fix things up a little before somebody like Alice Kenworth comes down to see us . ' With elaborate carelessness the boy stuffed his shirt tightly down under his belt , and , whistling , started off around the corner of the hotel to the backyard . I 'm forever blowing bubbles Pret-ty bub-bles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a square two-story house with a steep gable roof , four bedrooms for guests , and a lunchroom with one table and a short counter . It had stood across the street from the depot not more than fifty yards east of the tracks ; but when , in spite of the rumpus kicked up by the owners , the stockyards went into the narrow strip of land between the hotel property and the right-of-way , the building had to be moved . The Maynards sold out cheap to Al Graham , who set the frame building up on rollers and moved it across the street and a halfblock west of the depot . When he set it down , it sagged a little at one corner . Al Graham built a two-story addition , and then there was a not-sosteep gable cutting into the original at right angles , the new ridgepole a little lower than the old , and four new bedrooms upstairs . A little later Al Graham thought he needed a new kitchen , and built one in a hurry against the back wall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its sloping tin roof . Al Graham got the itch to try something else , and made a tidy profit on the sale of the place to Josh Craig , who had confidence in the town , thought it had a future . He built . Four more bedrooms upstairs then , guest-parlor and family bedroom down , and a new ridgepole parallel with the old one at the east end of the hotel . Except for the elevator , which was taller , it was the most impressive establishment in Bethesda . Some things happened . Joshua Craig died , and the place lost character . The C. B. &; Q. local abandoned its practice of stopping in Bethesda for the noon meal . Highways improved , and traveling men started using automobiles ? and who 'd want to spend a night in Bethesda if he did n't have to ?

Used by permission .  | on local retailers , and a drummer could clean up things in Bethesda in an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat a meal there if he was lucky . When , in late August of 1918 , Dwight Craig began waiting on tables , the hotel was never , as Minnie Schuyler put it , full up . ' However , there were still a few regular guests , among them one accidental survivor from the old days , Jacob Hirschberg , who traveled for Swift 's . But even Jacob Hirschberg was n't quite the same . In the old days , when Jake was younger and the future of the country looked good , Jake had carried himself with a great swagger , had had the reputation on the road for being a considerable sport , had chosen his shirts and suits and neckties with a fine eye for checks and stripes and unusual shades of green and lavender and purple ; and he had been a great kidder . When Martha Sinclair took over the hotel , Jake sized her up in a glance and promptly made her the butt of what soon became his most elaborate joke on the road . ' Well-well-well , ' he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sure of an audience , ' if it ai n't my old sweetheart Martha . ' If she could manage it , of course , she immediately began to beat a retreat , and sometimes she could escape him before the attack really got started ; but frequently he got her cornered , and he particularly liked to find her in one of the stores downtown , where he could usually put his solid flashy bulk squarely between her and the door . Then the assault would go on and on , rising and falling in pitch and volume , but always reaching some kind of battering crescendo before it was finished . ' My old sweetheart Martha , the most popular belle on the whole C. B. &; Q. , three times across the state . ' The words came out too rapidly for complete coherence , but if they made nonsense now and then , why , Jake Hirschberg was a master of nonsense . Rhythm was the thing , words made a rhythm , and you had to fill out the rhythm if you had an ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask you , do you treat me right ? Do you break my heart or do n't you ? ' Here he might burst grotesquely into song , stridently off-key , but the tone aggrieved , the face clown-mournful , the soft brown eyes tender and beseeching : In the gloaming , oooh , my darLING ! ? uh-WHEN the lights are sooooooft and looooooooow.  | Then a loud suggestive whisper : ' When 'll it be , honey , when you going out with me ? I 'll come around in my new gasoline buggy , slick as a whistle and snug as a bug in a rug . I 'm Simon Slick from Punkin Crick and I got a new gasoline buggy . ' Then , richly rising , loudly : ' I 'll take you to the city and buy you the finest feathers a woman ever saw . I 'll dress you within an inch of your life , I 'll make a beauty of you , oh , we 'll get you fixed up , we 'll show them , we 'll show them all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? turning to glare at his delighted audience I 'll show them . I 'll make them eat their words , they 'll learn to laugh out of the other side of the mouth , and that 's a game that two can play at , make no mistake about that . Wine at Delmonico 's ! Roast pheasant at the Ritz ! Get out the barouche , we 'll cut a wide swathe right through Central Park , we 'll make a large sashay together down good old Michigan Boulevard . Nothing but the best for that great American beauty , my old pal and sidekick , LILIAN RUSSELL SINCLAIR ! ' It would stop there , perhaps , or it would go on , the great voice rising and falling , castigating and caressing , raging and wooing ; and through it all Martha standing caught , paralyzed , whipped , her round eyes frantic , her soft face white , chin trembling , the quaking inside . And the little part of her mind that was still active fighting back at the expansive Jew , so amiable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase : killer-Jew of our Lord , killer-Jew of our Lord . More than anyone in the world Martha hated Jacob Hirschberg . That was in the old days , and in the old days there were many who could match Jacob Hirschberg in confidence , in loud exuberance , if not in wit and showmanship . But now , in Dwight Craig 's day , although Jacob Hirschberg still stopped over occasionally when something went wrong with his schedule or the roads were too bad for travel , there were n't any others like him ? or , rather , like the old Jacob Hirschberg . Now there tended to be , instead , men like Sport Melville , the stockbuyer , a small-boned dwarf of a man with a brick-red face who talked through his nose , carried his brown derby hat jauntily over one ear , wore scuffed tan shoes with cloth tops , and whispered stories  | on Main Street about the whorehouses of Saint Joe and Kansas City ? Sport Melville , who preferred the use of cheap perfume to regular bathing , so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he passed was thick and obscene . Or men like Ellison Busby , the auctioneer with the boiler-room voice and the great drooping tobacco-stained moustache , who cried stock sales all the way across the state from Council Bluffs to Keokuk , and always tried to get out of Craig House without paying his bill . And a few permanent guests , regular roomers , ' like Annie Hancock and old Raymer Williams , who worked in the lumberyard and had something wrong with his gums so that he left fresh blood on his pillow every night . And Jacob Hirschberg , even though he still stopped over occasionally , had changed . Young Dwight Craig learned to fear and hate him the first time he had to deal with him in the dining room . It was in late September , five or six weeks after his return to Bethesda from the City . Aunt Martha was paying him three dollars a week for waiting on table , and he was saving it carefully for certain obscure purposes which had something to do with all the desirable things he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preoccupied when he approached Jake 's table with a glass of water in one hand , the big black tray with the battered edges in the other . The man stared at him with malevolent bloodshot eyes . Who the devil are you ? ' The old magnificence was faded now , had dimmed swiftly in seven or eight short years ; but to the boy the man was foreign and still impressive . I asked a question ? who the devil are you ? ' Dwight . Dwight Craig . ' Craig , Dwight Craig ? What the hell ? you old Josh 's boy ? ? sure you are , course you are . ' The man looked at him and exploded with brief mirthless laughter . Josh Craig 's brat , my God Almighty . ' He laughed again . A dummy , too , by the looks of you . Well , boy , your old man was n't a dummy , and I had a score to settle with him before he kicked the bucket . Just put that in your noggin , Mister Craig , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Jacob . All right , all right , see if you can find some grub for me . Do n't suppose there 's any sense asking if there 's a choice ? no , I did n't think  | so . Well , dummy , do n't stand there , bring in your God-darned ratpoison . ' The boy backed away from him . At the next table Sport Melville snickered . Old Raymer Williams , whom Dwight always t eared with some condescension , was showing his bright red gums in a wide grin of foulness . Dwight , his eyes held fascinated upon his tormenter , moved toward the kitchen . Annie Hancock , her hair ablaze in a shaft of sunlight in a far corner of the room , rasped at him . Dwight Craig , I 'm waiting for my pie . Where 's your manners , child , I 'm waiting for my pie . ' ' Another county heard from , ' grunted Jacob Hirschberg . She turned on him ? the boy still in the room , watching . ' Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights around here . I used to freeze my hindend so 's they could have my stove to keep this kid alive when he was sick , and now I guess I got some rights around here . ' Freeze what ? ' Jacob Hirschberg wanted to know . Freeze whichend ? ' ? his old manner appearing briefly and horribly at the table , like Banquo 's ghost . Looks to me like one end of you ought a be able to keep the other one hot . ' He-he-he , went old Raymer Williams . Sport Melville 's giggle was a spurt of vibrant air driven out between thin tight lips . The boy looked rooted . Sport Melville recovered , and spoke . ' Speakin ' o ' freezin ' , kid , my coffee 's cold , colder'n ice . What you goin ' to do about it ? ' ' I 'll have you know ' began Annie Hancock . What the hell kind of a hicktown ramshackle downattheheel godforsaken establishment is this , anyway ? ' roared Jacob Hirschberg , his face purpling , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collar . Get a move on and bring my victuals , you crumby little dummy , or do I have to come out in your grimy kitchen and get it for myself ? ' The boy turned to flee , and dropped the big oval tray . It hit the floor slantwise and circled unevenly with increasing speed , coming rapidly to rest in tinny waves of sound . He left it there and ran , and heard the great explosion of laughter in the room behind him .  | In the kitchen Aunt Martha had already filled one of the heavy white plates with stewed chicken and dumplings for Jacob Hirschberg ; she stood facing the boy with the plate in one hand , and Miss Hancock 's apple pie in the other . Minnie Schuyler , who had just filled the big dishpan with hot water , spoke first . ' Where 's that tray ? Do n't you know you 're supposed to bring dirty dishes out with you after takin ' an order ? ' ' Oh , my dear , ' Aunt Martha said , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the matter , what did he say to you ? I knew I should n't have let you wait on that beast , that beast . ' She set the plate with the chicken and the plate with the pie on the table and started to kneel beside him . Oh , my God , ' Minnie Schuyler said ; and grabbed up the dinner plate in one hand , her red rough thumb half-submerged in thin yellow gravy , and the pie in the other . Oh , my God . ' Her long faded apron marked darkly with dishwater and coal dust , her hair hanging in strings about her scornful face , Minnie Schuyler marched into the dining room . Dwight Craig heard the laughter mount upon her entrance , and broke from his aunt 's arms and ran through the door and out to the cobshed , where he stayed so long he was late back to school . He slowly got used to the out-of-towners , learned to turn his fear and shame into hard silent hatred , and so to endure . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church for Sunday dinner without an almost overwhelming self-contempt . And of all those who came , the hardest on his pride were the Austins . The brusqueness of the banker , the hard prim-faced snobbishness of the woman , he might have learned just barely to cope with ; but that the boy , Charles , should be the weekly witness of his humiliation added so much to the burden that he almost broke under it . They were always the last to arrive , because the Methodist preacher was the longest-winded in town . Raymer Williams and Miss Hancock and perhaps someone like Ellison Busby would have arrived at the peach cobbler . One or two traveling men , unaccountably caught in the Sunday death of Bethesda , would be sitting , grateful for any diversion however slight , with cigars over the second cup of coffee ,  | their eyes fastened with hypnotic intensity upon all new arrivals . Perhaps in one corner the Callahans , who had the furniture store and lived in a house almost as big as the Austins ' , in spite of not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beef ; in another the schoolteachers , Miss Mather , who taught Dwight 's room , and Miss Cartwright , who was young and pretty and taught English in high school , would just have been served with roast chicken . Miss Cartwright made it many times worse , because sometimes she figured intimately in the boy 's most daring daydreams . Dwight , standing stiffly at the door by the sideboard which held the water pitcher and glasses and clean silverware and linen , would hear first the roar of the Austins ' Chandler Six out in front . Then the opening of the office door behind him , the sharp rapid taps of Mrs. Austin 's high heels on the floor , and he would know what now he had to face . They would come into the dining room , Mrs. Austin three or four paces in the lead , not even Charles speaking to him , and take their places at the square table always held for them until one o'clock . Then , and not until then , the woman with the thin tightly-pursed mouth would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even speak , precisely and distantly , to the Callahans , who had to be tolerated even if they were Presbyterians . Old man Austin would sit glaring silently at Dwight , who by that time would have brought them their water . Charles , with whom Aunt Martha had hoped Dwight might form a friendship , Charles , thin almost to the point of emaciation , and so smart by the time his mother had let him start to school that he was already in the eighth grade , although he was just Dwight 's age ? Charles would also sit , his hands carefully folded in his lap , staring without expression at Dwight . Roast beef , roast chicken , or steak ? ' Dwight would ask , mumbling the words and unable to look at them . The chicken , ' Mrs. Austin would usually say , ordering for all of them . You may bring the white meat for me and Charles ' ? she always went through with these directions , never missing a word , although they were well-known in the hotel ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your aunt does n't seem to know  | how to get the lumps out of mashed potatoes , omit them . Two other vegetables . Green tea for me , coffee for Mr. Austin with the dessert , and milk for Charles . Speak to the boy , Charles . ' Hello . ' Hello . ' Then , before Dwight could get away , there would usually be an exchange between the woman and her husband . The chicken last Sunday , ' he would grunt , ' was tough as binding twine . Bring me a steak . ' The steak is bad for your blood pressure . Young man , the chicken was tough last Sunday . Did you tell your aunt ? ' Yes . Ma'am , ' Charles would say , his face expressionless . Yes , ma'am . ' That 's right , dear , but it is n't polite to say so . Can you promise that the chicken will be tender today ? ' Sure , I guess so . ' Bring me the steak . ' ' I think the chicken will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tone commanding , her eyes hard and direct upon Dwight . ' You may bring Mr. Austin the chicken , some of the white and some of the dark . ' Then her eyes would descend slowly down the boy 's figure , fastening finally upon a smear of gravy just under the watchpocket of his pants . That will be all , ' she would say then , impatiently . ' That will be all . ' The boy would give the order to his aunt in the kitchen in a gruff voice , saying nothing about how the chicken was n't tender last Sunday , but Aunt Martha would prepare the plates and the sidedishes with special care . The tray would be loaded , finally , and carried to the banker 's table . Mrs. Austin and Charles would sit rigidly in their chairs looking carefully over Dwight 's head , but Mr. Austin would lean forward and follow each dish to its place on the table with suspicious eyes , shooting quick little wary glances at the boy each time his hand returned to the tray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austin might say : Serve from the left , child , it 's time you were learning that at least . Left when you serve , right when you remove dishes . ' And perhaps an audible little snort of amusement from Charles .  | He would return to the kitchen and wait . Sure enough , the bell on the Austin table would ring , sharply , twice . Back again , the three Austins facing him , their forks on their plates . It is no better than last Sunday , young man . You may change our orders . Roast beef , very well done , for Charles and me , and a steak , also well done , for Mr. Austin . ' And as he returned the full plates to the tray he would be saying over and over again inside of him : damn them , damn them , God damn them to hell . And all during the week he would avoid the gaze of the beautiful Miss Ruth Cartwright . The flu came to Bethesda a week or two after Dwight 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests came to the hotel except the regular roomers . Aunt Martha suffered the deepest and most helpless terror she had ever known , and as new deaths were reported each day , and new victims stricken , Dwight himself quailed before the fear of annihilation . He got so he refused to leave the house , even to go into the yard , and Aunt Martha exchanged violent words with the superintendent over his long absence from school . By November 11 the worst of it was over , and in the afternoon Dwight 's curiosity drew him downtown , where he stood a little apart from everyone listening to the band and the speeches on the platform that had been put up in front of Callahan 's furniture store . He had almost forgotten the war since his return from the City ; now his only feeling , mixed as it was with the lingering fear of death , was of regret that something incredibly exciting had come to an end , and he had n't had much fun out of it . He thought of his Sam Browne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered the hanging of those three Negroes who had raped , he thought , he was sure , a woman with Theda Bara 's face . It occurred to him then that he had never told anyone about it , and he looked quickly around for an audience , the flu forgotten . And there was his audience , bored , doing nothing , waiting for him , there were Jody Lehigh and Foureyes Farmer and Swede Johnson , slouched in front of Chuck Dill 's green-and-yellow barber-shop . Dwight approached them , trying to slouch and shuffle his feet the  | way all the big guys did , and when he spoke his voice was as deep as he could make it . Hey , you guys , you wan na hear sumpin ' good ? ' Hell with all this stuff about correct grammar . Three pairs of eyes looked him up and down , but no expression changed , no interest was apparent anywhere . Jody finally spoke . Jesus Christ , Snookums here do n't know the war 's over . ' The others laughed . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He grunted , in a way he had . ' Snookums , by God . Old Snooks Craig . ' They laughed again . How 'd you like your new name , Snooky ? ' Your aunty know you 're out ? You better go home and tell her you wo n't kiss her good night if she do n't start callin ' you Snookums . ' Snookums , Snooks , or Snooky Craig , spindly-shanked and with three new pimples on his face , turned and beat it home to the hotel . When he got there he found refuge , as he always did , in the cob-shed. 3 In the picture of his freshman class in high school , Dwight Craig is a narrow-shouldered , solemn-faced kid , whose indoors complexion seems to make his position at the end of a row of girls the right place for him ? he would have been too obviously and too startlingly the stranger , the white alien , if caught in the grinning , brown self-consciousness of the tattered male last row . He stands with the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing straight up on the top of his head and the heavy boy 's sweater with the big shawl collar he might be taken for one of them , with his large but sullen eyes , the delicate drawing of the mouth . There is intelligence in the face , but vanity , too , in the way the head is held , in the stiff erectness of the body , and in the space that separates him from his nearest neighbor : the row of white-middy-bloused girls with their arms locked together , the boy so carefully withdrawn from them and everyone else in the class . There is n't any very obvious change in the picture taken the following year . He is taller and has filled out a little , although he is still thin-shouldered ? it is more apparent here than in the earlier picture  | because instead of the bulky sweater he wears only a thin white shirt . There remains a suggestion of effeminacy in the face , which has a kind of prettiness in it just not quite offensive . The intelligence is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of worry between the large eyes ; and the worry qualifies the aloofness and earns for it something like sympathy . He stood with the boys that year , and was as tall as two or three of them . There is no picture for the boy 's junior year , but the change that shows in the one taken at his graduation is arresting , although that may be partly because it is an individual photograph , brought together with the others in a drab gray folder , and partly because of the stiff white collar and the coat and tie ? the other pictures were taken on a schoolday , informally . You get the grooming first , a handful of hints of self-conscious difference , strangeness in this company , in the obviously fine cloth of the suit , the careful knot of the comparatively quiet tie , in the close-fitting Arrow collar , in the smooth Glo-co sheen of the hair , in the way it had been allowed to grow down to the ears instead of being clipped close high up on the crown ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbits . Then , although it 's only a head-and-shoulders portrait , you guess that a couple of years have made a difference in stature ? the boy 's got his growth , he 's caught up with his class , his height is all right , he can look most of his associates in the eye . There 's some padding in the shoulders of his coat , probably , but the skinny look has gone . If you study all three pictures closely , you see that the hair has grown steadily darker , too , and that has its effect . However , all these hints are physical and , taken alone , superficial . What strikes you more strongly is the realization that the eyes are no longer sullen and withdrawn , and the old line of worry between them has been erased . The face now , as the result of whatever hidden effort , whatever secret decision , unconscious or deliberate , is perfectly handsome , perfectly smug , and perfectly blank . Of all the faces in the gray folder , Craig 's now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perfectly smug . And perfectly blank . Minnie Schuyler had also changed a lot with the passing of time ,  | although of course nobody paid much attention to it or thought anything about it . Some people wondered why she had stayed on at the hotel when everyone knew Martha Sinclair was going in the hole all the time . A few remembered what a great one Minnie had been when she was a young woman , how she 'd had such spirit and had always horsed around and had n't let anyone get ahead of her when it came to joshing . And now look at her , they said . Just look at her now , it do n't seem possible . But that was about as far as it occurred to any of them to go . She 'd changed , all right . She 'd put on some weight and her feet hurt all the time so that at the end of the day she had to hobble around like an old spavined brood mare . She 'd always had a sharp tongue , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly on smart alecks who had it coming to them , and nothing had been more fun than to hear someone get one of Minnie 's bawling-outs . Now she was just an old grouch who had it in for everybody and was so touchy it did n't seem like there was any way of pleasing her . But you could n't blame her much , when you came right down to it , being around that rundown old hotel as long as she had . Funny how she 'd stayed on there , having it in for Martha Sinclair and Josh Craig 's kid the way she did . Minnie did n't know herself which one gave her the biggest pain , Martha or the kid . She guessed maybe Martha , for letting him get to be the way he was . Sometimes she thought the woman was batty , because there was something kind of crawly about the way she fussed over him and the gone look she 'd get in those big popeyes of hers whenever the little feist came near her and the way she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fooling around out in the yard . It just was n't natural . Only a batty old maid who did n't know what it was all about could make such a fool of herself ? if she 'd borne the brat herself she 'd have had more sense . Like the way she carried on when the kid began to take a shine to the girls . Minnie knew what was eating her when it came to that business , of course : old Josh . Everybody knew that Dwight Craig probably had some little half-brothers or sisters kicking around the county somewhere , and that was enough to give a Jesus-lover like Martha Sinclair  | the heebyjeebies when Josh 's legal brat began to feel his oats a little . Sometimes Minnie felt like asking her why she just did n't go ahead and have his thing cut off and be done with it ; but instead she just kidded the old fool along and had some fun getting her worked up now and then . Like the time the little prettyface came home from school and asked if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Janice Sarboe 's . He was a sophomore in high then and the Sarboe kid was in his class , but it was n't a regular class party with one of the teachers going ? it was just something for some of the kids with nobody but old lady Sarboe around to try to keep them in line . Do n't you think you 'd better stay home and study , dear ? ' Martha . had said , sounding scared to death right away . The kid stuck out that baby lip of his : Everybody else is going . ' Who 's going to be there ? ' Everybody , I said , just everybody . ' But who , dear , who ? ' That was the way with her . It 's a wonder the kid did n't have to tell her how many times a day he went to the privy . ' Ralph Medwick and Jim Silvers and Fatty Banyon and maybe Clay Ferguson and I guess Ellsworth Green 's going too . ' The Green kid probably was n't going because he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craig , but the kid was smart enough to know that if the Greens were letting their little darling go old Martha would think the party was safe enough for Dwightie . Pretty little Snooky . ' Why do n't you go down to the moving picture tonight instead ? ' I do n't want to , that 's all . ' ' Well , dear , I do n't know , I really do n't think you ought " Why not ? Everybody else is going . ' ' If Janice Sarboe is having the party she must have asked some girls , too . ' The way the woman said girls you 'd have thought they were all a bunch of fancywomen or something . ' What girls are going to be there beside Janice ? ' ' l do n't know ? how should I know ? ' Are you sure you do n't know ? ' ' l just heard the guys talking , I do n't even know if there 's going to be many girls there . I think it 's just mostly fellows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know how Aunt Martha feels about it , you 're so young yet to be going out at night , way out in the country like that . I 'll call Mrs. Green and see what she thinks . ' ' l do n't know why you have to call her , ' the kid said then , looking worried .  | Other guys get to go and I do n't see why I ca n't . ' And of course he kept teasing , looking all the time like he wanted to wring her neck ; but old Martha stuck to her guns , kept on saying she did n't think he ought to go but she 'd see , and stuff like that . And finally darling little Snooky turned and went outdoors and slammed the door behind him hard enough to knock the wall in and a little later Minnie had to go out and yell for him to come in and get on the job in the dining room . He did n't say another word to Martha during the noon hour and she went around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minnie had some fun with Martha that afternoon . After they did the dishes they usually went upstairs together to do the rooms that had been checked out for the noon train , and it was faster if they worked together making the beds and that gave Minnie her chance . Of course Martha would never say anything about little Dwight because she knew the way Minnie felt about him . So Minnie just pretended she was n't even thinking about him or Janice Sarboe 's party when she started telling what she 'd heard about the gay old times the high-school kids had when they got together . Maybe Minnie laid it on a little thick , but from what she 'd actually been told she guessed you could n't stretch things much . The way the girls went around with their skirts hiked up to the sky so you could see everything God gave them was enough to show the way things were . You hear what they been saying about that Wippleman girl ? ' she began . The one that 's still in high school , Jess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha when she talked about such things , but out of the corner of her eye she saw that scared look on the old girl 's face and she had to grin to herself , way down inside . It beat anything else she 'd ever seen . Course I guess anybody 'd know what 's what the way Jess puts the paint on an ' all . Just last bandconcert night I saw her and the Sarboe girl downtown with their skirts so high you could see their bare hide every time they took a step . Come to think of it , I disremember whether it was Janice or not ? I guess maybe it was n't Janice ? I saw Janice a little later down on the corner talkin ' to Joe Lehigh and that young Bannister , only I guess they was just kiddin ' her along account of she 's a little too young to be foolin ' around with them . '  | Minnie paused and straightened up from the bed and looked straight at Martha . Martha picked up the clean sheet and threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled it down under the mattress on her side and went on . Well , about Jess Wippleman , that nosey old Mary Baker who lives across from the schoolhouse next to that old place of yours saw a couple go by her house one night when she was sittin ' in the dark behind them vines that grows all over her porch , an ' when they went under the streetlight there on the corner she saw it was Jess , only she could n't tell who the fella was except he seemed a lot older . She kept an eye on them , trust her , and they went straight to the schoolhouse . Well , she called up old Bob down at the butchershop and told him what she 'd saw , an ' old Bob got in his flivver and went down there ? cut off his engine and coasted the last block or so , I guess ? you know , so 's they would n't hear him comin ' . ' She paused a moment , struck with her own inventiveness , imagining how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from what Bob 's been tellin ' . ' Now old Martha was red , red as a beet ; and she was still stretching and pulling at the bedspread which was already smooth as silk and not a wrinkle in it . ' They was in that funnel they got for a fire-escape down there . Old Bob listened for a while and then he got a stick or somethin ' and beat up a big racket on the side of that there fire-escape that must 've sounded like the world comin ' to an end then and there . Lord , it must 've been fun to see ' em skeedaddle outa there . Bob 's sayin ' he knows who the man was all right but he ai n't tellin ' nobody 's long as whoever it was keeps on buyin ' meat of him . That Bob Baker sure is a smart business man . Well , course it may not have been Jess at all , ' cause old Mary Baker 's half blind , she ca n't see from here to there even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Number 8 , and Minnie began to pull the dirty sheets off the bed . An ' of course it was so dark down there at the school that old Bob himself could n't know for sure . But nobody cares much ' cause if it was n't Jess then it was somebody else , the Tanner girl or that little Elsie Galt who 's in Dwight 's grade or somebody , they 're all fast enough . An ' if it was n't Jess that time it was probably Jess plenty of other times , so it do n't make a lot of difference . '  | Martha picked up the dirty bedclothes Minnie had thrown on the floor and went down the hall with them . She was so long coming back that Minnie was afraid the fun was over , but when she got Number 8 finished and went down to Number 10 , Martha was just beginning on the bed there . If she thought she could get away from Minnie that easy she was crazy . ' My cousin Matty 's kid went to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once last summer , and from what he told his big sister I guess all they do is play kissin ' games and lollygag around . They got somethin ' now they call for in post office that means youknowwhat , express package or C.O.D . or special delivery or somethin ' , an ' all the boys think it 's smart to ask for that when it 's their turn . Only of course I guess they do n't really do nothin ' bad , leastwise not right at them parties ? just actin ' smart and lettin ' on they 're real little faststeppers . Come to think of it I reckon most of the gossip you hear 's just talk . Just ' cause they all show their knees and paint their faces and cut all their hair off short 's no sign . All the same , you sure do hear a lot of funny things . Yes siree-bob , you certainly do . ' Minnie let it go at that because she figured from the looks of her that old Martha 'd had about all she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minnie thought it did her good to find out a little something about what was going on in the world now and then . Lord , sometimes Minnie felt sorry for her , she was so blessed ignorant . Well , anyway , the kid did n't go out to the Sarboes ' that time , and Martha managed to keep a tight rein on him far as girls were concerned right up until he 'd just about got his growth . The year he was in the eleventh grade , though , he kind of kicked over the traces once or twice . Got to tearing around with Ralph Medwick in that little red runabout of Ralph 's that had been fixed up to look like a racer . Ralph 's old man gave him things and let him do just about as he pleased and you could trust Snooky Craig to see the advantages of kowtowing to Ralph . Barney , they called him , for Barney Oldfield , because of the car . In the spring of that year Minnie 'd see them sometimes after school all jammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of girls , going down the road raising a cloud of dust a mile high . Once Minnie went over to Bethel City to visit her  | sister and did n't get back until one o'clock in the morning , and the Medwick boy was just driving away from in front of the hotel . Minnie started upstairs to her room , but before she 'd gone two steps she heard them having a fracas somewhere in the back of the house and stopped to listen . Martha sounded so crazy that Minnie could n't get much of the story , but she did gather the kid had been out taking some lessons from the Galt girl , and from the way Martha carried on you 'd have thought there was a family on the way already . She got worse while Minnie stood there ? got to yelling about poor Rosemary and what a saint she 'd been and how the kid owed something to his blessed mother 's memory if he did n't to her ; and then suddenly it was quiet as death in the place and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what . Well , Martha was stretched out cold as a dead fish on the kitchen floor , and the kid was just standing there with the wits scared out of him looking at her . Minnie got a little scared her . self before the woman came to , it took so long , but they finally got her on her feet , Minnie realizing for the first time how fleshy Martha was getting ; and she walked the crazy fool into the bedroom and then came out and told the kid what she thought of him and got a lot of things off her chest she 'd been saving up for a long time . Martha 's going on about Rosemary that way had made Minnie think what a crime it was to have a kid of hers turn out to be such a useless little snipe . Before she got through with the kid he was sniveling like a baby . What a pair they were . Martha was on the verge of going completely off her nut , no doubt about it , and it all had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only girls . Everything . Each summer she let him go to the City to stay with that Craig aunt of his , that old witch Mrs. Stiles who 'd come snooping around the hotel two or three times , and every time he came back the kid was a little more uppity , always bringing a new batch of citified clothes with him and trying to get them to do things around the hotel the way they did them in the City . Lording it around like he was the crown prince or something . And Martha encouraged him and even seemed to like it when he told her not to do this , and to do that , to wear that and not wear this . She was so gone on him she 'd take anything from him and would n't have a word said against him .  | Look at it one way , no wonder the kid was stuck on himself . No wonder he went around acting like he was God Almighty . Lord , how the kid loved himself . They had an old folding-mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging on the west wall of the old kitchen , and two or three times a day Minnie 'd catch him standing there admiring himself ? front view , side view , even taking in the back of his neck . Minnie 'd just stand and watch him , not letting on . He 'd get a sappy look on his face and fuss with his hair and stick his chin up in the air and sort of peek sideways at himself , edging the mirrors around just so ; and then sometimes he 'd make his lips move as if he was talking . He 'd frown , and smirk , and hoist one eyebrow up a foot or so above the other one , and make faces like that for hours-on-end if Minnie 'd ever had a mind to keep quiet that long . Or he 'd grin at himself . That grin of his . The little darling 's be-ootiful smile . Oh , Lord , that Martha . Sometimes Minnie felt almost sorry for her . Nobody nowadays got the benefit of loveychild 's be-ootiful smile but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he began to get his growth his last two years in high school , but according to Minnie 's cousin Matty 's kid who was in the grade behind him and sharp as they come , it did n't do him any good when it came to taking care of himself with the other kids at school . Carl said any boy in high school could throw him with one hand tied behind his back ? he did n't know how to use what muscles he had . Carl said the only thing was , it was n't much fun because practically everybody had done it and Snooky always gave up too soon to make it much of a thing to do . Minnie was of a different mind about that . There was plenty of times when she felt like taking him on herself . Of course you had to admit he was smart in some things . Around the hotel he had his nose in a book half the time ? although Minnie knew a thing or two about some of his reading matter that it was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd fixed up a place for himself out in one corner of the cob-shed with a chair and table he 'd made in manual training at school , and once when Minnie went out after cobs to start the cookstove fire she saw he 'd forgotten to snap the padlock on the table-drawer , and she thought she 'd have a look .  | Well , there was a bunch of those little blue books in there you get by sending through the mail , and the kid had picked out the juiciest ones he could find  --  Forbidden Love , and Sex Physiology , and Prostitution in the Ancient World , and Woman 's Sex Life , and Lord only knew what else . Minnie got a big laugh out of it ? no wonder he spent so much time out in that place , quiet as a little mouse . And old Martha trying to keep him away from all the high-school kissing parties and the kid pulling the wool over her eyes all by himself out in that shed , getting around her with a bunch of books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' l He was smart , though . Martha was always bragging about the grades he got in school , and when he won the declam contest the first year he was in high , the woman did n't talk about anything else for two months . The kid went ahead and won the two following years , too , and got to thinking he was a regular Jack Barrymore or someOh , he was a hard one to live with . He made her sick to the stomach . But probably what made Minnie sorest was the way he acted about the hotel . He did n't do enough work to half pay for his keep , let alone getting anything extra ; and he got more and more uppity in the dining room until Minnie heard downtown that a lot of folks quit coming there to eat just because they did n't like the way little Dwight put on airs with them . And Martha never made him do any of the heavy work , like bringing in coal and scrubbing floors and things like that . Minnie saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the kid was in the parlor saying over one of his pieces for declam , or else just reading or something equally useless . Of course that meant Minnie usually went out and took the axe away from Martha , because she was so all-fired clumsy that like as not she 'd chop a leg off sooner or later if you let her . And that last year in the hotel , when the kid was a junior , he was it worse than ever . He crabbed and found fault all the time . When are we going to get rid of this dump ? ' he 'd say ; and when Minnie 'd come right back at him and tell him it was his bread and butter , he 'd just laugh at her in that sarcastic way he had and ask what bread and butter . Well , Minnie knew as well as anyone and better than most  | that the place was n't any more than paying for itself , if that ; but she always said that if there was anybody around to take hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any good to talk about quitting because whoever 'd buy the dump anyhow , now ? It was silly to talk about getting rid of it , and Minnie got sick and tired of hearing the kid whine around about it , and she felt like rejoicing when the time finally came for him to go off to the City for the summer , and all during the summer she dreaded the time when he 'd have to come back . She got along with the kid Martha got to take his place just fine . Not all the kids in Bethesda were like old Snooky Craig . Coming back to that hick town at the end of the summer was always enough to drive a guy nuts . Coming back to that broken-down dump . Only consolation was , maybe this was the last time . Only sense he could ever see in it was that he 'd started to high here and might as well finish it out , might as well play along at it . Another year of that , and then the City for good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fussed with the collar of his shirt . He winked at himself in the mirror , and whistled a tune . Gee , but I 'd give the world to see ? THAT ? OLD ? GANG ? OF ? MINE. * He grinned suddenly , using only one corner of his mouth , the way he 'd been learning to do that summer after watching a guy in a movie . Oh , sure , you bet I would , I 'd give the world to see them all right . I 'd give the world not to see them , never in the rest of my life . The hick bastards . He left the room , Number 12 , where he 'd been bunking for a couple of years now , and went downstairs , tiptoeing , and out through the office to the street , getting out of the place without Aunt Martha seeing him . He walked rapidly , holding his breath past the feed store the way he always did because of the stink . What a place ! The blacksmith shop was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the place , was sitting there with a wad of snoose in his jaw , alone in the broken-down old car-seat in front of the joint . Hi , Otto . No answer came the reply . God , the loonies in this wideplace-in-the-road . Enough to populate a whole bughouse and some left over for the County Farm . * Reprinted by permission of copyright owner , BOURNE , INC.  | It was a swell late-summer evening . He began to feel good , for no reason at all . Geeeee , but I 'd give the world to ? see . He crossed the street , heading for Espy Esperson 's drug store . That ooooold GANG of MINE ! Espy 's was the only place open on Main Street , that time of day , except for Chuck Dill 's barber-shop , and the loafers who hung around there were older . Dwight turned in at Espy 's . There was n't anyone in the front part of the store but Clay Ferguson , who was washing glasses at Espy 's hicktown soda-fountain with its half-dozen wirelegged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vanilla and Strawberry and Raspberry and Cherry . Fergy Ferguson had n't changed in two months , still looked like a farmer , way he 'd look all his life . ' Hi , Craig , ' Ferg said , polishing a glass , his Adam 's apple popping up and down in his skinny throat . ' When ' d you blow in ? ' He tossed his glass in the air , caught it , and placed it rim down on the shelf behind him . Dwight straddled a stool and looked into the mirror behind the bottles and the glasses , answering Ferg in the mirror . ' On the fivefifteen , ' he yawned carefully , watching himself . Anybody around ? ' He had a good voice , although of course he mumbled his words the way all the guys did . Yeah , ' Ferg said , jerking his head toward the back room where the gang gathered to smoke and talk because Espy was a good guy and liked to hear the football and baseball and woman gossip from the high . ' How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess , ' Dwight said , making it bored . He leaned across a couple of stools and pulled a Photoplay magazine out from under a copy of Young Wild West on Espy 's magazine table . He put it in front of him on the sticky marble slab of the fountain counter , and opened it . He studied Richard Dix 's necktie , inspecting the knot , comparing the pattern with a tie he had , one he 'd bought in the City . He spoke , his eyes on Richard Dix 's haircut . You goin ' away this fall ? ' ' Naw , ' Ferg said , pulling a fancy one with a glass , tossing it and catching it behind his back . All right , Ferguson , all right ? everybody knows you were a handy first-baseman . I 'm stickin ' around this year . '  | ' Thought you were goin ' to college ? ' ' Naw , not this year . This year I 'm just stickin ' around , workin ' for Espy . Espy could n't get along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew the real answer . Ferg 's old granddad Hamilton just would n't cough up the dough to send him to college , that 's all . Probably the guy would be stuck in this dump the rest of his life ? marry Mabel Reilly who 'd been going steady with him for two years and have a bunch of kids . Dwight looked at Marian Davies dressed up like a man in Little Old New York . Old Marian . ' How 's Mabel ? ' ' All right , I guess . How 's all that harem you 're supposed to have in the City ? ' They 're fine , Ferguson . They wanted me to give you their love . ' He tossed the magazine back on the table and sauntered back to where the guys were , slouched around the cold stove in Espy 's back room among the boxes of soap and the cartons of toothpaste and the drug bottles and the compressed-air tubes Espy used to charge the water for the fountain . There were Jackie Morse and Barney Oldfield Medwick and Jim Silvers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Dwight . And Batty Bannister , who was twenty-one and had quit school when he was in the tenth grade and was the fastest shortstop the town-team had ever had . And Fatty Banyon , who had graduated last spring and was working for his old man at the depot and learning telegraphy . And of course old Espy , with his bright eyes and his fat stomach . Hi , you guys . ' Hi , they all said , or hi-Craig . All except Batty , that is , who laughed and said , ' Well , if'n it ai n't old Snooky . ' Dwight found a perch on an empty crate by Barney Medwick . Hell with Batty Bannister , what did he always have to be hanging around for ? ' How 's the big hotel man ? ' Batty asked , a dead roll-your-own cigarette sticking to his lower lip and bobbing up and down when he talked . Old Espy giggled . The other guys looked at him , but Dwight kept his mouth shut . He was sore , and felt low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in school if you could n't crack back at a moron like Bannister and put him in his place without even having to think about it ?  | ' When 'd you get back ? ' Barney wanted to know . Barney Oldfield and his little red racer . Barney You know this new song they made up about you , Barney ? ' Dwight asked , ignoring Batty 's question . ' They sing songs in the City , Snooks ? ' Batty asked . ' Hell , I thought they did n't have any sissy stuff like that in the big towns . You sing in the church choir up there , too ? ' ' What song ? ' Barney wanted to know . He poked Dwight with his elbow . ' What they singin ' about me ? ' Dwight cleared his throat . Bar-ney Google , with the goo-googoogelly eyes . Bar-ney Google had a wife three times his size . ' * That was enough . Jim and Jackie and Fatty slapped their shanks and laughed to beat hell . Old Espy yelled . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good one , ' he said . ' Barney Google . ' He grinned sourly at Medwick , and it was Barney 's turn to take it . ' Hell , and I always thought you was Barney Ol'field an ' you was this Barney Google all along . ' Dwight felt a little better . Barney was probably sore and would n't take him out in the racer for a while , but he could fix that up all right . If you do n't like it , Medwick , you know what you can do . Dwight did n't look at him . Have a big time ? ' Jim Silvers wanted to know . Jim 's old man had the dray , and Dwight wished someone else had asked the question . Nobody paid much attention to Jim . ' Oh , all right , ' he said . ' Things were kind of dead . ' ' You get out to the Fair ? ' Espy asked , looking interested . Yeah , one day . ' ' See the auto races ? ' Barney Google @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was n't sore after all , the dummy . ' Yeah , ' he said . They were keen . ' ' See that guy get killed ? ' Even Batty was perking up his ears now . Dwight wished he had been out there the day Speed Mack turned turtle and got spread all over the track , but he had n't , and he did n't think quickly enough to pretend he had . ' Naw , ' he said ? and saw Batty 's interest fade . I saw something better , though , ' he added quickly . He paused long enough for complete attention to focus on him . ' In the Midway .

Hell , I saw ' em once . ' Some of ' em ai n't so bad , ' old Espy said . What were they like , kid ? ' His eyes were like bright little buttons . Throw a gunnysack over their heads and they 're all alike , ' Fatty Banyon said , trying to let on he knew what it was all about . They got some pretty good-lookers in that bathing-beauty show , ' Dwight said , speculatively . At least not too bad . ' I bet they was n't , ' said Espy . ' I got away from the old woman up there last year and saw ' em . They had one that looked a lot like that Barbara La Marr in that show she was in ? you see that show , any you guys ? ? the one where that old Babs she takes off almost all her clothes , right down to the skin almost ? ' ' Bathing beauties , hey ? ' Jackie said , ignoring Espy . They swim ? ' asked Batty . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There it was , that was the break . ' Hell , they do both , ' Dwight Craig said , leering worldly-wise , ' an ' when they come up outa that tank with their suits wet you'n tell they really got it . ' Everybody laughed his head off at that , and Dwight Craig thought maybe things were going to be a little different this year . He 'd been there an hour or more when the firebell rang , fast and loud . When he heard it his heart raced the way it always did when the old bell sounded , and he wanted to run out of there as fast as he could , but that was n't the way a big guy acted when there was a fire . So he sat still and tried to take it easy and bored . ' Prob'ly old lady Baker 's chicken-coop again , ' Batty said , and they all laughed . There was a note of uneasiness in it , though , because a house fire was n't always so funny in Bethesda , especially with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one tonight . The Bethesda Volunteer Fire Department was the biggest joke in town  --  unless it was your house . The bell kept on ringing . Say , ' Fatty said , his eyes round and  | scared in his big flabby face , that do n't sound like no chicken-coop . ' They all got to their feet , and heard , above the bell , Clay Ferguson calling central out in front . Ferg 's finding out . ' Then they heard his steps coming rapidly toward the back room , and his white skinny face appeared in the doorway . It 's your place , Dwight , ' he said . ' You better get down there right away . ' Before Dwight could collect his wits and get under way , before anyone had really made a move , Dwight heard Batty Bannister say , Well , Snooks , looks like maybe you 're gon na get outa the hotel business at last . ' It was dusk turning to black night outside , and even from Espy 's you could tell it already had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing in his mind at all , but when he got there and saw the flames all over the old roof of the middle section of the hotel and the people standing out in Main Street with their faces pleased and excited in the red light , he felt despair and terror mingled and wanted to get out of there as fast as he could . Before he could move , Mrs. Banyon came running around from the back between the sample room and the hotel and yelled that Aunt Martha wanted him and there was nothing he could do but go with her . The men had gathered rapidly and had already moved a lot of stuff from the hotel out into the backyard , and Dwight saw the big zinc-topped worktable and the rocking chair from the parlor with the broken springs in the seat and his aunt 's old white iron bed with the paint flaked on it ; and right in the middle of the sagging bed the white chamberpot looking obscene with the red flames reflected in its shiny surface . Then he heard Aunt Martha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstretched and her face twisted out of shape and he wanted to get away but his legs would n't work right and she had a strangle-hold on him before he could move . It took him several seconds to break away from her , but even then he could n't seem to stir and she stood there in font of him yelling g and crying , and then finally Mrs Banyon and Mrs. Overholster came and took hold of her and for some reason gave him a dirty look before they marched her away and made her sit down in the rocker looking funny out there in the yard , and the women worked over her trying to get her quiet . He stood staring at  | the flames , which were spreading rapidly , reaching out against the wind toward the old east end because that way the wood had had almost forty years to dry and season itself for fire , and being blown with tremendous force toward the west end , the new part ? new ' still after twenty years . She 's a goner , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw Barney beside him and repeated it with an effort to make it sound tough and indifferent : She 's a goner , all right . ' Let 's go round front and watch the pump-engine , ' Barney yelled . They ran around to the street . The men did n't have the water coming yet because they had to lay the hose clear from the town cistern down on the bank corner , but Charley Norton and Jimmy Callahan had the engine going licketycut to get it warmed up , and its racket was added to the crackle of the flames and the yelling of the people . Dwight felt a little better . He thought he might as well enjoy it . It was almost as light as day in Main Street now , and when old Harry Galt stuck his head out of the window of Number 8 and yelled for folks to stand back , he really got a kick out of it . Lookit old man Galt , ' he yelled at Barney and Foureyes Farmer , who had joined them . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't wreck more stuff than the fire . ' Old man Galt moved back out of sight and then they saw the big commode from Number 8 edging sideways out of the window , and it stuck and old man Galt gave her a big shove and it took out the upper half of the window and all the glass and the window sash , and the commode came banging down to the sidewalk with a crash and clatter you could hear above all the rest of the racket . There was n't a whole piece of wood left in the commode and everybody got into the spirit of it and cheered old man Galt , who sent a couple of chairs down after the commode , and then began on the bed , sending out the old cotton mattress first . Hey , Galt , do n't forget the pot , ' somebody yelled , and then everyone was shouting at him and cheering him on , saying Attaboy , Harry , old kid , bust ' em up you old fire-eater , bust ' em up in business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pot . Dwight got a hell of a big kick out of it . When old man Galt threw out the rope fire-escape and started to let himself down over the windowsill it was just like being at a circus or something . Then somebody yelled that old lady Hancock was still in her  | room , and the men standing near Dwight and Barney and Foureyes began to yell at each other about going in after her and before they were through they were cursing and sounding ugly about it , but nobody moved because old Hancock 's room was in the middle section and it looked as if the roof was going to cave in there any minute . Dwight felt sick and was about to go off by himself somewhere to lie down , anywhere out of sight of that mob of people , but just then the screen door of the office entrance flew open and out came Annie P. Hancock herself in person , with nothing on but her nightgown and a funny old wrapper and clutching her canary cage in one hand and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when she ran out into the street with her red hair all frizzly and looking like a bright blaze itself in the reflection , and her mouth going a mile a minute but no sound coming out , just that big bony jaw of hers flapping up and down , it was funnier than ever and Dwight and Barney and Foureyes almost split a gut . Then he remembered something . He remembered something suddenly , something he 'd forgotten . He remembered he had some stuff of his own in there . He had some stuff of his own up there in Number 12 , there was a lot of stuff of his own up in that old room of his . He 'd forgotten about it and nobody else would ever think of it . There was a whole suitcase of stuff he 'd brought back from the City just that afternoon . And a lot of other stuff . There were some new neckties he had n't even worn and a new belt with a silverplated monogram buckle and a new pair of pointed-toe oxfords and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times and the brown checked suit he 'd got last spring over at Bethel City and his overcoat that was only a year old , his tan belted overcoat with the big collar , and his World War relics , the gas mask and the tin hat and the canvas-covered army canteen , and all his books and his shelf of Photoplay magazines and , oh , just a hell of a lot of other things he could n't afford to lose ; and without thinking he made a dash for the office door . But Jimmy Callahan who was the chief shouted at him and he came to his senses , not because of Jimmy Callahan but because of the heat on his face , and he turned and saw Jimmy and old Bob Baker the butcher standing with the hose between them pointed right at him . He just barely had time to get out  | of the way before the water came out in a great white noisy spurt and hit the office door and knocked it off its hinges . ' You crazy ? ' Barney yelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff was in there , and he sounded so funny and surprised about it that Barney and Foureyes really did nearly split something . They were throwing water up on the roof now , but the stream did n't look so powerful as it had when it hit the office door , and the way the wind was blowing it seemed just to go into spray before it even got up to where the flames were . Dwight felt the mist from it on his hot face . ' Hell , those bastards 'll drown us . ' The fire had crept back against the wind to the old east gable , and now it looked as if the whole roof there went in one mighty burst of red flame . Dwight saw it , saw for the first time what fire could do , saw the fire and felt it rage across his face , and for some reason he began to swear at the top of his voice . ' God damn it why do n't they do something they 're a fine bunch of bastards why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to Barney , and he saw Barney grinning and nudging Foureyes and Foureyes laughing . It 's my home , ai n't it ? It 's my home , what you laughing at , it 's nothing to laugh at , how 'd you like it if it was your house ? ' And he swung his fist at Barney , the first time he 'd ever tried to hit anybody in his life , but Barney sidestepped it easy enough and gave him a shove , easy , still laughing at him , not even sore because Dwight had tried to slug him . He gave him an easy shove , and Dwight nearly fell down there in the dirt of the street . And he turned and ran like a fool away from them east toward the tracks , just getting away from them , ran toward the tracks and then swerved and cut left around the east side of the hotel toward the back . Once he stopped , and while he stood there trying to get his breath saw the faded old letters in CRAIG HOUSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat . Then something fell down through the second floor into the diningroom and fire sprang up in there and through the window he could see the tables standing reddish and strange-looking with the linen and silver on them all laid out for breakfast and the sideboard with the water pitcher and the big black oval tray with the battered edge hanging up above the sideboard , and he began to sob . Hell , hell , hell . He ran back to the alley .  | He watched it from there , alone . He got himself under control a little , and watched it . Oh , she was a goner all right . She was gone , the old hotel was gone , the dump was gone forever , she was a goner . The hotel was a sure goner and nobody gave a damn , they thought it was a joke , they thought it was a picnic , they 'd all come out to see the fun , come out to see ramshackle old Craig House go up in smoke , out of the hotel business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fun , see what the place was made of , see what they 'd had inside of that dump . Save the pot , Harry , save the pot , and the white pot was there for everybody to laugh at in the middle of the white iron bed , and , oh , what a fine joke on Josh Craig 's brat . Oh , the laughing bastards , damn them all to hell , this was something else to get even with them for , they 'd learn what it was to laugh at a guy like him . But , oh , she was a goner , the whole west end was ablaze now , the laughing bastards would be lucky if the whole block did n't go . Let it go , let the whole town go , let the whole town burn to ashes the way the hotel was going , then see how they 'd laugh . Let the whole town go , that would serve them right . If the whole town would only go then he 'd have the laugh on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred , and watched it . They were worried out there in the street now . The shouts out there were louder , and then he saw the water hit the side of the little sample room west of the hotel and saw the steam rise up from its hot clapboards , and then the stream of water moved farther west to give the feed and grain store a dousing . They 'd really given her up , then , they 'd given up the old hotel . Then the people in the backyard began to shift around , and he saw they were moving the stuff in the backyard , the old beds and the kitchen tables and the cabinets and the chairs , back toward the alley where he was standing to get it all away from the heat . And he saw a woman stumbling toward him with a straightbacked chair in her hands , and without knowing who it was or why he did it he yelled at her . Where 's Aunt Martha ? ' He saw then that it was Minnie Schuyler . She recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , and she put down the chair and made for him in a funny hobbling half-run , and he let her come without trying to get away . She came right up to him and stuck  | her face close to his and he saw then that she was bawling like a baby . What the hell 's she got to bawl about , it 's not her place . Her eyes looked wild and mean , and her mouth worked , and then she was cursing . Damn you , you little snipe , you little feist , God-damn you , Jesus Christ God-damn you , you yellow little feist , you yellow little cowardly feist . ' And she laid her crazy hands on him and tried to shake him but he was bigger than she was now , he was n't a kid any longer she could push around , and he grabbed her by the elbows and held her and they stood there holding each other staring and Dwight was scared of her and afraid to let go . All right , ' she screamed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , I would n't hurt a feist like you . ' What 's eatin ' you ? ' he cried at her . What in hell 's eatin ' you ? ' The fight went out of her , then , and she just stood there blubbering . ' Your aunt 's up to the Banyons ' , she wants you bad but we could n't find you , so they took her up to the Banyons ' . ' What 's the matter with her ? Godamighty , what 's the matter with her ? ' Some of the woman 's fury returned . You got your wish , that 's what 's the matter . You got your roof burned off your head and I 'm sorry you was n't in it ! ' ' I did n't wish that , ' Dwight said , staring at her stupidly . ' I never wished anything like that . ' ' Oh , yes , you did , ' Minnie Schuyler said . ' Oh , yes , you did wish it . And then you run off like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been cryin ' for you an ' now she 's up there cryin ' at the Banyons ' an ' you do n't even care . ' ' I did n't know where she was , ' he said . ' I 'd of gone up there if I 'd known where she was . ' ' Go ! ' the woman screamed at him . ' Go , then , why do n't you go ? ' ' I 'm goin ' now , ' Dwight Craig said . I 'm goin ' right away , you do n't need to yell your head off . ' He actually thought the old fool was going to swing on him then , he thought she was going to take a crack at him before he could get away from her . He commented on it aloud , to himself , as he walked away from her up the alley in the direction of the Banyons ' . Christ almighty , Christ al-mighty , what the hell 's eatin ' on that old fool ? '  | They saved the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure how the fire started , although Minnie Schuyler thought somewhere around the flue of the old furnace , somewhere around where the flue went up through the attic . They had to have the doctor for Aunt Martha the night of the fire to give her something to quiet her and make her sleep , and for two days the Banyons and Dwight together could n't get her to leave the Banyon house . When , on the third day , they got her to go down to look at what had been the hotel , Dwight felt sort of heroic and important about it , and as they walked from there to Blessman 's to see about the insurance he held himself erect and solemn and carefully accommodated his step to his aunt 's , so everyone could see how capable and thoughtful he was , in spite of all the trouble he 'd been through . They got about fifteen hundred dollars in insurance for the building , and a week after the fire Mr. Austin arranged for the sale of the lot for six hundred to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several years . Everybody said the fire was the first lucky break Martha Sinclair had ever had . There was a lot of kidding around downtown about how they 'd always known she was a firebug , but of course nobody took it seriously . As far as it 's being lucky was concerned , Dwight Craig was the first one to appreciate that . He thought now they could live in a house like other people and have some decent furniture and things and he would n't have to go around being ashamed all the time . It did n't work out quite the way he 'd planned . They rented a little four-room house out on the county road in the northwest part of town , a brown little box of a place with a low pyramid roof and two small bedrooms and a kitchen and parlor , and furnished it with odds and ends that had been saved from the fire ? a couple of iron beds and the hard old leather sofa that had been in the hotel parlor and a Morris chair and some rockers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his aunt looked worried and said it would just be temporary ; and that was all right , he figured it had better be temporary , but she had something else on her mind , she went on talking , and Dwight Craig was n't so sure about the rest of it . It 's just this one year , ' she said , her voice trembly , not looking at  | him . It 's just this one year , and then we 'll ? then we can , then . ' He felt quiet as death inside , watching her , listening to her . Away from here , ' she said . Half of it sounded so crazy he could n't make head or tail of it . Waiting for the right time , she said , and she 'd been planning , she 'd been saving and planning . And she looked at him , and said there was something he did n't know about . It was mixed up . Mr. Austin , she said , and he wondered what that old skinflint had to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of half of it , but the other half he got all right , and listening to her he felt quiet inside , and he did n't know how to handle it . It was something he 'd never thought of , he 'd never thought of anything like that at all . I do n't know , ' he said . He did n't look at her . ' I guess ' he began . It 's something I always ' she said , her voice quavering . One hand moved toward him , stopped , went to her mouth . He saw the fat flesh of her upper arm . When I sold the place , ' she said . He did n't know what the hell she was talking about . He thought about the house . ' I think we 'd better be looking around , ' he said . This dump 's all right for a few weeks , but we 'd better see about getting something else . When I go away to school you ought to have a better place than this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fast . He felt a little mean about it for a while , but he did n't see what else he could have said . It was n't long after that when he heard downtown that the Jasper house was for sale . It was a fine place , a remodeled bungalow with an indoor toilet and a big tree-shaded yard , and he brought the news home with the short-spoken advice that they 'd better buy it in a hurry , they 'd better snap it up right away , because a buy like that did n't come along more than once in a lifetime . She asked how much it was , and he told her . He could n't help sounding sore about it . We ca n't , ' she said . Why not ? ' he asked . He threw down his cap . ' I do n't see why we ca n't , ' he shouted . This dump 's worse than the hotel . ' It 's good enough for me , ' she said . The tears rolled out of her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . It wo n't make any difference to you . '  | He slammed out of the house . The following week she told him she 'd bought the dump that was to have been just temporary . For a week he would n't speak to her . But in other ways it was a pretty good year . It was the nuts being a senior and having the right to lord it around the high-school assemblyroom and to talk about having one more year in jail and to discuss the problem of college seriously with his teachers . He was uncomfortable for a while during the football season because there were so few boys in high school that year that Larry Lipshultz , who taught physics and general science and civics and bookkeeping and coached football and basketball and baseball , had a hard time getting eleven men who weighed enough even to look like a team , but when Larry and the guys talked to him about it he said he could n't get his aunt 's permission to play , and around the stove in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a tyrant . When the basketball season he felt free to go up to the old opera house where they came around had the games to watch practice , because there was no pressure put on anyone to go out for basketball ? it was easy enough to get five guys together who were really good at that . So he dropped in to watch basketball practice now and then ; and at Esperson 's he 'd say , when the talk took that turn , Jesus , wo n't I be glad when baseball comes around ! Lipshultz had lost nearly half of last year 's baseball team by graduation , and Dwight figured he might as well take a crack at one of the infield positions when the time came . He did n't bother much with girls that fall . He and Barney Medwick had taken out Elsie Galt and Ruth Tanner a few times last spring in Barney 's racer , but to tell the truth he was a little afraid of that Galt woman . He 'd done some thinking about women last summer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags around Bethesda were all pretty crumby . Hell with these women around here , ' he said one night at Espy 's not long after the fire . ' They 're a damn crumby bunch if you ask me . ' No class , eh , Craig ? ' Fergy Ferguson asked . Hell , they do n't know what it 's all about . ' Then he remembered Ferg 's Mabel Reilly . ' I mean ? well , hell , all the good ones are going steady . '  | Ferguson laughed , and it sounded sarcastic . All right , sodajerk , some day when you 're stuck here with that hick female and a dozen kids 1 ' 11 come back , I 'll drop in on you ? just passing through , see , just going to , say , Chicago or New York or somewhere , and it was n't far out of my way and I had to drop in on Bethesda for old times ' sake , see . And I 'll be married to the most beautiful woman ever hit this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look up , the very first guy , just to rub your long nose in it . Okay for you , Fergy Ferguson , and that chunky foureyed female of yours . Okay , okay for you . What about Galt ? ' Jim Silvers wanted to know . I thought last year you and her was all fixed up . I thought you was gettin ' to be a regular sheik . ' Well , ' Dwight said , ' a guy 's got to get a little experience . ' He tried a leer on them . How is she ? ' Not bad . ' Speculatively , applying strict metropolitan standards , thinking them all over , all the women in his life . Not bad at all . ' Jim Silvers , the drayman 's son , let loose with a scream of highpitched laughter . You 're some sheik , ai n't you , Snooks ? ' he asked when he got his breath . Then he spoke to the others , Jackie and Buzz Norton and Stuffy Williams and Clay Ferguson : Galt told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man she 'd take Charles Austin . ' Everybody laughed at that ? everybody but Ferguson , who just sat there on his pratt looking frig any of these women around here you 're ? you 're a bunch of damn fools , that 's all . Get ' em knocked up or something and then where are you ? ? stuck in this hick town the rest of your life , married and a bunch of kids . Or maybe get a dose or something . I 'm just smart , that 's all . You guys are a bunch of damn fools . ' When the new girl came to town , he got even with them . Genevieve Traill was the daughter of the guy who ran the new lumberyard the Bethel City people were establishing on the old hotel site , and the first day she came to school Dwight took one look at her and saw right away she was the keenest woman who 'd ever hit town . She had short black hair with two spitcurls plastered down on her cheek in  | front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed little breasts under her light-red sweater . Her black-and-white plaid skirt was at least two inches shorter than any other girl 's in school and her knees showed white and round and soft-looking through her thin black silk stockings . She had a lot of fancy rings and bracelets and things , and she wore a little round piece of black courtplaster high on one pink cheek , the way Gloria Swanson had in that show Zaza . Before the end of the week he 'd fixed up a date with her for Saturday night . Since it was really important , he announced his plans to Aunt Martha in a way that let her know there were going to be no if 's , and 's or but 's about it . When Saturday night came and he got ready to go she followed him to the door and asked her question before he could get away . You are n't going to stay out late , are you , dear ? ' How should I know ? ' he said savagely , and let it go at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of course there was a light on and he found her sitting in the rocker by the library table , but he just stalked through the room looking mad and did n't even speak to her . He undressed quickly and got into bed , but it was a long time before she turned out the light in the parlor . Okay , okay for that , he said to himself ; and then lay and thought about Genevieve Traill . It was a little funny about the Traills . Dwight naturally supposed they were from Bethel City , but they were n't ? they were from Saint Joe , and it turned out that Simon Traill had worked on the road for a big wholesale paint firm with which the Bethel City lumber company had done business . And Simon , who seemed like a good-natured cuss , had thrown up his job and his nice home in Saint Joe to put up part of the money for this little two-bit business in Bethesda , and after living in the big town most of his life had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road . Dwight could n't figure it out at all , but it was a lucky break for him because Simon Traill bought the Jasper house that Dwight had wanted Aunt Martha to get for them and they moved in a lot of furniture that was fancier than anything ever seen in Bethesda , and before long Dwight felt almost as much at home there as if he owned the place himself . He and old Sime got along swell . Gen came to Bethesda in January , and Dwight had a date with her  | every Saturday night right up until their bust-up in April . At first he was a little uncomfortable with her and was stiff and awkward on their first date and he did n't try much of anything with her in spite of staying so late . She was the prettiest woman in high school and she came from a big town and her old man seemed to have a lot of money . But he saw that those things impressed the other guys , too , and he told himself he had to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep her to himself all right , though , because even on that first night , just before he left , she said : You want to know a secret ? Well , I 've decided you 're about the best-looking fellow in school . ' If she had n't said that , he probably would n't even have had the nerve to kiss her good night . But it was n't long before he got over being afraid of her . He could n't help seeing she was pretty dumb in school , and he talked a lot to her about how he was going to enter Slade University next fall , but had n't made up his mind what to take up . Sometimes he thought he 'd be an engineer because he was pretty fair in math , but then there was law , too , and he guessed he was n't a bad public speaker . Or business , there were these courses in business at all the colleges now , and he guessed maybe there 'd be more dough in business than in either engineering or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get started in law . ' Gee , ' she 'd say , looking up at him with those pretty brown eyes of hers , Gee , you 're about the brightest fellow I ever saw . But you know what ? Well , I think you ought to go on the stage . Lots of fellows in moving pictures are n't a bit better-looking than you are . Gee , kid , honest , you 're a regular Rudolph Valent-eye-no : He figured he had the world by the tail that winter and early spring . Going steady with Gen Traill made the other guys change some of their ideas about him , because they 'd all have liked to be in his shoes . Gen 's parents listened attentively when Dwight told them about college and how he could n't make up his mind what to go into , and he thought they understood that he was a lot smarter than Gen and that she was pretty lucky to be going around with someone like him instead of one of the hicks who 'd never been out of Bethesda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the business course at Slade , and Dwight made up his mind that was probably the thing to do .  | The only thing that worried him was that maybe sometime Sime or the old lady would slip downstairs or come in from outside unexpectedly or something , and catch him and Gen on the davenport . She was so hot that sometimes he got a little scared ; and even though of course they never went the whole way , if the old man had walked in on them he could have told soon enough what they 'd been doing . Sometimes Gen acted as if she 'd gone completely nuts . Now and then he 'd pretend he wanted to go the whole way , but then she 'd fight him a little and he was thankful that she was really a nice girl even if she was so passionate , for he did n't want to get into any trouble . He told her he loved her a good many times , but he figured they both knew it was just in fun . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for declam again that year and won first in the oratorical division and a few weeks later won the county contest over at Bethel City . That meant he had to get through only two more , the subsectional and the sectional , in order to go to the state contest . When he won the subsectional by unanimous decision of the judges he told the guys at Espy 's that he was afraid he was n't going to have time to go out for baseball that spring ; and even Simon Traill agreed that probably with a talent like that it would be a good idea for him to go into law . The sectional was the first week in May , and he and Miss Cartwright , who was still teaching high-school English and coaching declamatory and plays , decided he was going stale on his piece , The Message to Garcia , and he 'd better change to something else . They finally decided on The New South , and then he had to work his head off to get it ready in time . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One night when they were talking she accused him of being stuckup , and without thinking he came right back at her with the crack that he could n't help it if she was n't any too bright and did n't know what he was talking about half the time . Gen got a mean look on her face , and said if it was bright he was talking about he was n't smart in anything but school stuff and that when it came to some other things he was the worst rube she 'd ever seen . He did n't like the sound of that and asked her in what other things , for instance , and she said never mind , she  | just guessed he 'd been his aunt 's little darling all his life and always would be and what she wanted was a man . He told her that he guessed she was nothing but a hick after all like everybody else in the damn town , and walked out on her and never went back . He regretted it a little when he saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things up by laughing when she said something dumb in class ; and the last week before the sectional declam contest he proved what kind of man he was by getting chummy with none other than Miss Ruth Cartwright herself . Miss Cartwright got the keys to the opera house and they went up there every night to practice his piece , and he called her Ruth once to her face and she did n't object . She must have been pretty old ? twenty-five or thirty , probably ? but she was built all right and still pretty good-looking in spite of having a thin nervous-looking face and being almost as tall as Dwight . In school she was always talking about some woman called Edna St-Something Millay who wrote poetry , and sometimes she lost her temper when the guys laughed at the stuff she read to them . She had a deep husky dramatic voice , and Dwight tried to imitate her when he recited . He remembered how he 'd had a crush on her when she used to eat at the hotel and how embarrassed he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old lady Austin bawled him out . He had to show her he 'd changed since then and had developed into a guy who knew his way around , so he went on calling her Ruth when they were at the opera house and the last night before he went to the sectional he walked home with her . He pretended he was tired when they got up on the front porch where she stayed and sat down on the porch swing , and they talked about the contest a while and wondered what kind of judges he 'd get , and then she sat down beside him . If he had n't been feeling smart as all getout and reckless as hell he 'd never have had the nerve to try anything with her , but as it was he finally put his arm around her and leaned over and kissed her on the mouth ; and instead of slapping his face she grabbed him around the neck and kissed him back and he began to give her a real going over . And the damnedest thing about it was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd pull back and laugh in a hoarse funny  | way every once in a while , or she 'd look at him there in the dark ? there was enough moon for him to see her face ? and say , Dwight Craig , Lordy-me , Dwight Craig , what do you think of that ? ' But after a while she began to crawl all over him like a crazy woman , and when she took his hand and put it down inside the neck of her dress he got scared and kind of disgusted , and the way she was wheezing she sounded like an old woman . He wanted to get away but he did n't know exactly how to manage it , and anyway it was a real experience and he figured he might as well see it through . But when she began to fumble around the fly of his pants he suddenly felt like vomiting , and he grabbed her wrist and held it . She struggled for a while , and then , quickly , they were both on their feet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She caught him before he got out on the sidewalk and took hold of his arm and pulled him around to face her . God , she was strong as a horse . The moonlight was full on her face and she was bawling and looked a sight generally , with her hair in a tangle and her lips swollen and her dress twisted and rumpled and the tears running down her cheeks . You wo n't tell , will you ? ' she said , over and over again , her voice strange and high-pitched now . You wo n't tell on me , will you , Dwight , you wo n't tell on me ? ' He shook his head , wanting to get away from her , but she held on to him until he said it aloud ? no , hell no , he would n't tell on her . And when he was half a block away he looked back and saw her still standing there watching him . Well , for Christ sake ! ' he said to himself , aloud , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , Christ Almighty ! ' He remembered the time three or four years ago when the fourthgrade teacher , Miss Perkins , had been fired inside of a week after she 'd gone to a movie in Bethesda with a high-school senior , and what a hero Art Akerson , the guy who 'd dated her , had been after it had happened . He wished they 'd find out about tonight , just so they 'd all know the kind of stuff he could get away with when he felt like it . He particularly wished old Gen Traill could find out about it ? he still had a big score to settle with her . And then , walking home in the moonlight , when everything seemed to be working out just about right for him , he suddenly did n't feel so  | good . He felt lower than he 'd ever been in his life . He walked along in the moonlight swearing savagely to himself . ' God damn them , ' he said . ' Oh , God damn them all to hell ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of him she said he could have fifty dollars to buy clothes for graduation , and one Saturday he got a ride to the City and bought a forty-dollar suit and a pair of shoes and a new necktie that cost him two dollars . He had a quarrel with Mr. Charleton , the Bethesda photographer , about how he should pose for his class picture : he wanted a profile taken from the right side , but Mr. Charleton tried to sell him on the full face , or , at the least , three-quarters . They compromised by Dwight 's letting him take all three poses . When the proofs were ready he studied them closely and finally decided that maybe the three-quarters face was better than the profile after all . When he went to see Miss Cartwright about practicing some more before the state contest , she would n't even look him in the eye , and mumbled something about his not needing any more coaching ? at least not in declamatory . She sounded mean , and he thought what the hell , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in trouble with you , you 're crazy . He did n't bother her after that but practiced his piece alone , putting in some new gestures and trying out different facial expressions in the mirror in his room . When the third week in May came around he thought he probably had the state championship sewed up , but it did n't go so well in the big auditorium at the state college where the final was held . It was a much larger crowd than he was used to , and when he walked off the stage at the end of his oration he was afraid he 'd been pretty much of a flop . When the decision was announced , he was surprised that he 'd even placed third . On the way back to Bethesda , though , he decided that it was n't so bad , and everyone at home thought it was wonderful just being in the state contest . Nearly everyone thought that . He let them know it had been pretty close and most of the judges for those things got their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . He was satisfied , and decided he ought to go into law sure enough . But he said to himself it was the last time he 'd ever take third place in anything .  | Because in September he would be leaving for a nine months ' stretch ( for good , he told himself , I hope to God it 's for good ) , he let Aunt Martha talk him into staying in Bethesda that summer , the first one he had spent in the town since he was ten ; and of course inside of a week he did n't know what to do with himself . He re-read all the Curwood and Kyne and Wright and Tarkington novels in the public library and met all the trains and spent the afternoons sitting with the old men on Main Street and killed the evenings hanging around the drugstore with the gang . Of course those dummies tried to get sarcastic now and then about the fact that Dwight was n't working , but he usually managed to crack back at them in one way or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guy was as hard up for company as he was he could n't afford to be too choosy ; and laughed aloud when he thought how they 'd feel in a few years when they heard how much dough he was making , what a wide swath Dwight Craig was cutting in the City . I 'll spit in their faces , ' he said aloud . ' I 'll expectorate right in their damn faces . ' Of course there were plenty of scenes in the little four-room cottage . Before many weeks had passed he decided that Aunt Martha was nuts , and kept away from her as much as possible . It turned out that she actually had had some notion about going with him when he started to college , and the little discussion they 'd had on the subject not long after the fire had n't finished it by any means . The reason he began to think she was loony was that when she was n't carrying on about his leaving her she was worrying about money , and she could n't seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot more to get him through college if she were to move to the City with him , instead of letting him go alone and live in his old room at Aunt Sarah Stiles ' . It did n't make any sense , any way you looked at it . When the rural teaching job turned up for her he thought it would be better , but actually it was almost worse because she had some new things to go on about . The position was offered her because all the board members in that district belonged to Aunt Martha 's church , and she told Dwight that she had promised to take it when Mr. Everly first approached her because her mind had been on him and the expense of college ; but now she was frightened ? the way the boys  | behaved out at that school was notorious and she did n't know whether she could handle them or not , and of course with Dwight away she would n't have anyone to turn to for advice , and , oh , if it were n't for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There might , she said hopefully , be some trouble about getting the certificate for her . There was n't , although when it went through there was something new to worry about , since the temporary certificate was granted only on the condition that she would go to the Normal School across the state line in Missouri the following summer ; and oh , going to school , Aunt Martha said , I do n't see how I can , I 'm so old , I 've never done anything like that . Give it up , then ! ' he yelled at her savagely . It do n't make any difference to me what you do . ' It was like that in the little house for three or four weeks . Dwight Craig did n't know which way to turn . It was an incident at the drugstore one night in August that got him out of the whole mess nearly a month earlier than he 'd expected . It would n't have happened if Esperson had n't moved the magazine ' rack from its old place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he thought the new magazines would be less accessible as free reading to the soda and coke trade . Dwight was standing back there looking at the September issue of Photoplay when he heard the guys talking . In its new position the rack was within six feet of the door to the back room . He heard the laughter , and it lasted longer than usual and attracted his attention for that reason , and he stood looking at Marguerite Clark 's picture and thinking he 'd better join the gang and find out what all the shouting was about , but before doing it he turned another page and Nita Naldi was on that page and he hesitated , giving himself for the moment to the large-breasted woman dreaming up at him from the shiny page , and in that moment the laughter died out and Buzz Norton spoke . Christ , ' Buzz said . I guess every guy in high school had some of that . All you needed to do was tickle her hand . ' Every guy but one , ' Jim Silvers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' It was a good arrangement , ' Jackie Morse said . ' He paid her way to the shows , and that made it cheaper for the rest of us. '  | Well , ' Espy Esperson said , his old man was n't dumb that way . I guess maybe he was n't dumb any way . He 'd probably even kept that hotel making money if he had n't kicked the bucket . ' He did n't even wait to put the magazine back in the rack . He carried it out of the store with him , carried it right past that bastard of a Fergy Ferguson who was working behind the fountain ? Ferguson , who was also going to Slade that fall ; carried the September issue of Photoplay out into Main Street and home to his room without paying for it . The next morning he told Aunt Martha he 'd decided to go to the City a month early , in order to look around for some kind of parttime job before classes began at Slade . She carried on so about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given in to her .  | III DID YOU EVER HEAR OF JAMES GIBBON HUNEKER ? ' I ' LL SHOW THE KID a good time if I bust a stay doing it , she said Ito herself , I 'll cheer him up or my name 's not Alice K. Kenworth . She slipped into the beaver coat she 'd finally managed to wheedle out of poor old Eddie at the very end of the season last year , pressed it against her face to enjoy its warm softness , and then stooped quickly to put on her overshoes ; and was torn by a sharp pain in her abdomen that took the blood from her face and left her weak and trembling . She laughed to herself , shakily , and sat down quickly . And I 'll probably be lucky if it 's only a stay . For a bad minute she sat there , alone with her pain and her fear . I 've got to see a doctor , it might even be  --  cancer . Then , swiftly , I got to keep it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was even able to laugh a little , remembering how Eddie had pouted like a spoiled brat when she told him she 'd got the afternoon off from that kike store she worked in to go to a football game with this cousin of hers and then do it up brown afterward , taking him down to the Tea Room at the store for dinner and maybe a picture in the evening . I got this cousin of mine who needs a little jazzing up so Saturday night 's off , she 'd said , and then all hell had broken loose . She laughed again , and eased herself forward slowly , gently , felt no warning signal , and got into her overshoes . Ga-loshes . What the hell , they 'd always been overshoes and they 'd always be overshoes , at least for old Alice On-her-last-legs Kenworth.  | She smoothed out the fine silk of her stockings . Not a bad pair of pins for an old woman , not bad at all . A little meat on them . Eddie did n't go for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked things comfortable . The kid was embarrassed about something and gruff as a bear on the way to the stadium , walking along beside her dragging his feet through the crackly leaves , his overcoat tied tightly around his middle with the belt , hair plastered down close to his head , ears already red with the cold . You should 've worn a cap or something , kid . ' He looked at her angrily . ' Oh , I know , it 's the style , ' she said quickly , but she was puzzled . He was a nutty one and no mistake . But God , she felt sorry for him , having to live with that old Christer Sarah and Fred Jackson ? that sniveling old hypocrite of a Fred , hinting around that she was a bad woman because she had a few nice things and liked a good time . Gosh , I never thought I 'd be stepping out with a regular college man , ' she said aloud . I 'm not a regular college man , ' he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look here , young man , I 'll have you know . I just do n't date rubes . You 're a regular college sheik and do n't try to kid me about it . ' He laughed again , and suddenly she had half a mind to go home and call up Eddie and tell him to see his bootlegger and come to the rescue ; but then they were moving into the stadium and she figured she might as well go through with it . Oh , Lordy-God . Well , she 'd known the kid was in a bad way , that was why she was here , so what kind of a wishywashy jellyfish would she be if she walked out on the job now ? She 'd stick it out or her name was n't Alice K. Kenworth . She did n't know beans about football , and when the sun moved down and left their section of the stadium in shadow she almost froze her tailbone in spite of her beaver , but the kid perked up a little and acted halfway human and Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the way it was supposed to ? Slade won . When they put over their touchdown in the last two minutes of the game , the kid went nuts . He slapped her on the back and acted like a maniac , and Alice felt pleased ? that was more like it , he could be normal after all . ' That was Tiny Tim , ' he yelled in her ear , ' that was old  | Tiny . ' She felt like a fool . Who was ? ' she shouted . ' The guy who carried it over , ' he yelled , who 'd you suppose ? ' Where is he , which one is he ? ' The one without a helmet ? now he 's going to kick . Old Tiny never wears a helmet . ' She saw him , then , and even the way she was feeling she got a bang out of watching him . He was a beautiful article and no mistake , with his tight-curly blond hair and the Tarzan build he had and the cock-of-the-walk way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to fight ' em off with a club . She watched him pose , held her breath when the ball was snapped ? and when he put his body through the composed pattern of the dropkick she felt a lump in her throat , it was so pretty . Dwight was screaming with joy beside her and Alice Kenworth kept saying over and over to herself , he 's a lady-killer all right , that boy 's a lady-killer and do n't ever forget it . She knew what she was talking about , too . The kid was feeling pretty good when they made their way out of the stadium , and she thought it was going to work out all right . She even thought maybe she 'd enjoyed the game a little . Not the game so much , perhaps , although if she 'd spotted this Tiny boy sooner even that might have been all right ; but the bright colors and the smell of autumn and the marching bands and the bouncing yell-leaders and , oh , just being out in this big crowd of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having nothing to do for four whole years but go to school and run around to football games and dances and things . She 'd been reading just last week in some magazine an article where it said that a college education was worth twenty-five thousand dollars in hard cash , and dough like that was n't to be sneezed at ? if it was true . If it was true , this kid beside her would be in the jack some day and no mistake . You want to go to dinner now , or what ? ' she asked him , feeling impressed in spite of herself . What 's on the ticket ? From here on it 's my party and it 's anything you say . ' They were crossing the campus now and the sun was definitely down and the air sharp and cold in the lungs . On the way they 'd passed a couple of sorority houses with a lot of flappers in coonskin coats hanging around with their cake-eaters outside , and through one window she 'd seen a big fire going in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside . The kid apparently had n't heard her , so she repeated the question . Hey , wake up ? what 'll we do now ? Look , maybe we could go to the apartment and listen to some records or something before dinner . And anyway I do n't want to go plodding around downtown in these overshoes . ' Dwight said he guessed that would be all right , and she spent the time on the streetcar , hanging from her strap in the crowd , trying to figure out how she could make him snap out of it again . When they got to her place she put I 'll See You in My Dreams on the victrola and went to the kitchenette to start some coffee . While she was there she had a pull out of the pint Eddie 'd left her the night before , and when she returned to the living-room she felt pretty good and decided to try to find out what was eating the kid . She found Tea for Two and started it going and went over and sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb Dora how it feels to be going to college . ' It 's all right , I guess . ' ' I bet it 's pretty tough at that . Burning the midnight oil and everything like that . You going to make it all right ? ' What do you mean ? ' Grades , and getting by in your classes , and all that . ' Sure , there 's not much to that part of it . ' He sounded contemptuous . It 's not very tough , that part 's nothing to be scared of . I 've been pulling down A 's in everything so far , so I guess there 's not much to that part of it . ' That 's swell , kid , I 'm sure glad of that . ' Only watch it , kid , she thought , and do n't be a snot about it . I guess you 're the brainy one in the Craig family . I 'll tell you something , though , I always said your dad would 've gone places if he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too if I know anything . ' She was n't prepared for the genuine surprise in his face . I thought ? is that so ? ' She remembered , then , the way that pious old biddy of a Sarah went on about her brother . Whatever you thought 's wrong , do n't let anyone kid you about your dad . He had a head on him and I 'm darn glad you ai n't going to let him down . How you getting along other ways ? '  | ' Oh , all right . ' She looked at him shrewdly . Picked out a girl for yourself yet ? ' ' I guess not . ' ' Well , you 're smart not to be fooling around and wasting your time , and power to you , I say . Stick to business , and when the right lady comes along you 'll know it . What about all this frat business ? ' ' What do you mean ? ' ' I mean are you a frat man ? ' He sulked . Huh-uh . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied his shoes . ' I was asked , I had plenty of chances . ' Well , you 're smart to leave ' em alone . You take these frats Sure , I 'm smart ! ' he said savagely . ' They know what they can do with all that stuff ? women and fraternities and tearing around and all the rest of it . They can all go to hell . ' ' Well , do n't take it out on me , ' Alice Kenworth said . That 's what I was saying , you 're too smart to ' I 'm no sissy , either , ' he growled at her . ' Do n't get any ideas like that ? I 'm just playing it smart . ' He jumped to his feet , started the record over again , and turned to face her . ' I know what you did out there in the kitchen . What 's the matter , you stingy ? I guess I 'm man enough to take a drink if I want to . ' That made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good stiff slug of the stuff into a glass before she came to her senses . It would probably be the first drink the kid had ever taken in his life , and oh , God , he 'd pop his cookies and make a fool of himself and what the hell did you do with a nut like him ? The first social drink , she thought glumly , and from there on whiz downward on the slick path to ruin . I 'm a fine one , I 'm a fine one all right , I 'm the one who 's always sneaked him out of that house to make him do things they do n't want him to do . That Josh ? oh , my God Almighty , that Josh . She tasted the stuff in the glass and felt it hit her stomach . But what the hell can you do ? The kid was out there asking for it and he had plenty of freedom now and if it was n't here today it would be somewhere else tomorrow . Stingy , hey ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , stirred some gingerale into it and went back to the living room .  | He did n't look quite so tough when she handed him his glass , and she thought she saw how it really was with him and felt better . She started to say something like bottoms-up or mud-in-your-eye , but suddenly cracks like that seemed out-of-place or something , so she just said here 's how Eddie to herself and tossed off half her drink and took a record without looking to see what it was and started it going full blast . It turned out to be The Man I Love , and she 'd liked to have stopped that , too ? it did n't seem quite the right thing somehow . But before she could figure out what to do about it , the kid sort of took charge himself . Look , ' he said , standing in front of her , looking big and handsome in his dress-up suit , how about teaching me to dance ? ' Well , she thought quickly to herself , at least maybe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the thought of whose feet it would probably keep him on made her laugh out loud . She saw him start to get sore at that , but she was feeling all right now and fixed it up with him . I just thought of a joke ? you know how old I am ? Forty-two . ' She laughed again . Leastwise that 's what I admit , Are n't I the fine one to be carrying on like this ? ' She started to move a little with the music . All right , kid , come on , I 'll see what I can do for you . Although the Lord-God knows I 'm no Missus Arthur Murray . ' It did n't turn out too badly . One reason it had popped into her mind to say that about her age was her sudden small fear that maybe once the kid got a drink or two into him he 'd lose his head and try to get fresh or something ; but as soon as he put his arm around her for the dancing she saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shameful old fool . And she need n't have worried about the drinking ? he took a couple of sips out of the glass , acting as if it was poison , and then put it down and did n't touch it again . She was a little surprised at his awkwardness , though ? he never did catch on to the step she was trying to teach him . She thought perhaps it was because he seemed afraid really to take hold of her ? you got to get a good grip on the girl , kid , so she can tell what you 're going to do next ' ? but he did n't , he never figured it out , and she wondered if maybe he was n't just plain awkward in spite of looking so well-set-up . However , she thought he was having a good time for a change . She honestly believed the kid had never had any fun before in his life .  | Before they left for dinner she asked him if he did n't want to finish his drink ? she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even with him for that stingy ; but when he mumbled that he guessed he 'd had enough , Alice was sorry she 'd put it on him . She wanted another shot badly herself but decided she better not . They 'd spent so much time fooling around that there would n't be time for a show after dinner , and maybe she could get rid of the kid in time to call up Eddie and then she could really let down her hair . The kid was friendly and talkative now , and he stayed that way all through dinner ; and when she finally got off the streetcar to walk to her apartment she was thinking he was a funny one and no mistake . He had a lot of bad features , but somehow she could n't help liking him and feeling sorry for him . He was one boy who was going to have a hell of a hard row to hoe . For one thing , he was proud as the very devil ? stuck-up , if you wanted to come right out with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand sometimes he was just a backward clumsy kid , bashful as all getout , and country written all over him . Up at Garbstein 's Tea Room , which was about the snazziest place in town except maybe the Sunflower Room at the McKinley Hotel , he had gawked around like a regular rube , had acted scared of the waiter , and when , dreading it but game , she 'd asked him if he wanted to try out what he 'd learned on the dance floor , he 'd just gulped a couple of times and said he guessed he did n't feel like it right now . He was n't really brassy , she thought . He was just stuck-up a little in a nice way . And he had a sweet smile , when he felt like using it . I 'll see you in my dreams , she sang to herself , hurrying to her apartment . That song . Lips that once were mine . The crazy kid . At first up at the Tea Room he 'd tried to put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on he was bored or cynical or something , but about halfway through the main course he 'd broken down and given her an earful about the way things were with him . He really was n't having a very good time . Part of it was money ? she gathered it took quite a lot of the old mazuma really to cut a swath at college . There were a lot of rich kids at Slade ? stuck-up little snots from the West End ? and they sort of set the pace in all the good times out there . And it  | was money , of course , or the lack of it , rather , that was keeping the kid out of one of their frats , and it seemed as if you somehow were n't in things if you did n't join one . Alice Kenworth liked a good time herself and knew how it was to feel left out of things . ' Tell me about your friends ? ' she 'd asked , and he 'd looked her square in the eye and said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his home town who worked in a drugstore out there in the district and was attending Slade , but Alice gathered he and Dwight did n't hit it off very well ? Dwight had some kind of grudge against him for some reason . ' But you must have got acquainted with someone , ' she 'd said , and then he 'd talked for a while about a fellow he sat by in one of his classes , name of Aiken or something , whose home was in the City . He was n't in a frat because his parents did n't think they were good for a kid , but he had his old man 's car to run around in and Dwight thought he was probably ' pretty keen . ' Alice decided this Aiken must be Jesus Christ on wheels to rate that kind of compliment from the kid , who was n't exactly reckless about his praise . ' He 's a good-looking guy and wears classy clothes and he 's a pretty good friend of mine . ' Alice had her doubts about that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping for him herself , walking home in the cold night . Ferguson ? that was the name of the one from Bethesda . That guy 'll be a rube all his life , no matter how long he lives in the city . ' Once he sort of forgot himself and got to raving about a girl , some little Sheba who sat by him in one of his classes and was a musician of some kind ? at least she always has this music roll with her whenever I see her around . ' Names , Alice Kenworth thought , there was a time when I 'd remember a customer 's name even if she came to the kike 's only once a year . Ferguson ? and this girl . Hawthorne . Helen Hawthorne . A shrub of some kind or something , a nice name . Helen Hawthorne . Dark-red hair short and wavy about her head , and long black eyelashes and ? ' just a classy look about her , classy and sure of herself . ' He 'd looked at Alice a little shyly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boy had a crush on this Helen Hawthorne all right . So Alice had asked him why he did n't go ahead and fix up a date with her , and for her pains she 'd got both barrels of that flareup temper of his , The idea seemed to be that Helen Hawthorne was  | pledged to the best sorority on the campus and could take her pick of the fellows and with all the competition how could he expect to take her out on the kind of money he had ? Oh , the kid , the crazy kid . She tried to get him to talk about his home town and that aunt of his down there who had brought him up , but it was like pulling teeth to get anything out of him on that score . What did you do after that hotel burned ? ' Nothing  --  just got a house , if you 'd call it a house . ' Was there insurance ? was it covered all right ? ' Much as it was worth , I guess . ' And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll bet she misses you . ' I do n't know ? I suppose so . ' He gave her one of his surly looks . ' I do n't see what I can do about it . ' You ought to write her a lot ? I guess she 's been pretty good to you . ' I suppose so . ' What did you say she was doing ? ' ' Teaching . ' Teaching ! ' Alice Kenworth said . She must be pretty smart . ' Just in country school . ' ' Well , even so , it 's sure something I could n't do , I could n't begin to do it . Does she like it ? ' ' Not much , I guess , ' Dwight said , mumbling . ' I guess it gets her down sometimes . ' He looked at his food . ' I ca n't help it , it was n't my idea . ' That was as far as he 'd go , but Alice did n't like the sound of it . She thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he got off on Sarah Stiles and the Jacksons , she just about decided that most of the trouble lay right there . The old lady particularly nagged at him and prayed over him all the time , and Alice wanted to know why he did n't move out , but Dwight said he had to stay there because it did n't cost him any rent . But what a place , he said . ' They put me in that hole-in-the-wall I used to have summers , and they 're renting the big room that Willoughby used to have to another fellow , a rube Bible student . God , I wish I could get out of there . ' Money  --  she finally asked him pointblank how much he got  | from home , and it sounded like quite a lot for a kid ; but it seemed that about half of it had to go toward paying off the note he 'd signed for tuition , and the board was n't free in the old lady 's household even if the room was , and there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go very far . For a moment Alice played with the idea of lending him a little each month herself , but there was something about him that made her hold back . If he ever got in a really tight place she 'd help him out , but right now she thought it would be wise to let him work it out alone . He had a lot of things to learn , and it might do him good to have to scrimp a little for a year or two . Alice Kenworth let herself into the apartment , took off her hat and coat , held the fur tight against her face for a moment or two , and sank into a chair . She looked at her watch . Hellfire , it was nearly ten o'clock . She realized that she was down in the dumps for sure now , she did n't really get much of a kick out of missionary work , and she was dog-tired ? she thought almost too tired to call Eddie . But she kept getting lower and lower , just sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid ? and then for a change thinking about herself , about her own troubles , about Eddie , and working at the kike 's , and the throbbing trouble in her belly , and she knew she would n't sleep for hours and being alone was worse than anything else in the world . She called him up , finally . He still had his mad on , but he said he 'd come over . She had to tease , but he finally said he 'd come . She was so relieved that she had to weep a little ; a handsome woman , although a little loud maybe , and a bit too thick around the middle , standing alone there in the room still holding the telephone in her hands . When the first-semester grades came out Dwight found he 'd made straight A , and he felt pretty good about it because he 'd expected a B in Physics . On the whole , though , he had n't been so much impressed by the old college grind as he 'd expected to be . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from the way they 'd been in high school ? if you let them know you could put two and two together without straining a brain muscle they were always willing to give you the benefit of the doubt whenever you were n't quite up to snuff . He 'd  | play along with them , though ? it was part of the plan to stay up there at the top . Make a good record for four years and then move out into the dough , the kind of dough to make ' those two-bit cakeeaters around the Iota Psi house look like a bunch of tramps . Stay up there at the top . He had n't made up his mind yet whether it would be Law or Biz-Ad ? he thought probably Business because it would be faster ? but whichever it turned out to be , it would be half-whipped if he made a good scholarship record . In March he got a job slinging hash at Kelleher 's Kollege Kookery . When he finally decided to take the job he went around feeling sick at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get Mrs. Kelleher , a smartly groomed woman with a handsome figure and hard shrewd eyes , to give him kitchen work , which would be dirtier but still better than having to take orders from kids his own age , but there was only this counter vacancy and it was that or nothing at all . He took it , because he had to have some extra dough and the job would save him the board money he 'd been paying Flora , but he hated it . It was more humiliating than his old work at Craig House . And the women were the worst , the women from the sororities who came in at noon because lunch was n't served at any of the houses , the women from the sororities with their impersonal eyes and snooty ways . At first Dwight tried to pay them back in their own coin , but one day Mrs. Kelleher gave him hell and told him if he could n't learn to be courteous she 'd let him go and get someone who could . He could n't afford to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit on credit downtown , so he had to change his tactics . He found out soon enough , from the way those hightoned bags from Tri-Bete and Alph-Iota and Gamma Lam reacted , that a perfectly polite formality put them in their places more effectively than the old rudeness and gave them nothing they could complain about . Finally he even got so he rather enjoyed seeing them come in , because just by saying I-beg-your-pardon a few times and making them repeat their silly complicated salad-and-tea orders , he could make them quite uncomfortable and at least halfway aware of his existence . Except one . That Hawthorne , that Helen Hawthorne . It did n't work with her , it did n't make her squirm , it did n't put her in her  | place . She was dumb , probably , he thought maybe she was just too dumb to be conscious . He 'd never seen a smart redhead in his life . Good-lookers were always dumb , and Helen Hawthorne was just a dumb red-head pianist ? he 'd found out she played the piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trombone . Hawthorne , just another dumb Gamma Lam . The first time he beg-your-pardoned her she just looked at him as if she did n't know the language , and when he had to say it again she tried to throw him off base by apologizing . Oh , I 'm sorry , she said , and repeated her order , all the time looking at him with that dumb bewildered look of hers . Beautiful but dumb , always pretending to be nice as pie to him , too dumb to know when she 'd been insulted . As far as the rest of them were concerned , though , it got to be a routine , and it was n't on his mind so much during the last month or two of the semester , partly because he and Lowell Aiken got to running around together and having a little fun . At first Dwight had been suspicious of him because he 'd always lived in the City and had seemed pretty sophisticated , but he got over that when he found that Aiken had a tough time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for him when he went out with a girl . One night Dwight told him about having an affair with a schoolma'am back in his home town , and old Aiken 's eyes were round as saucers when Dwight got through building it up . Gosh , ' he said , staring , I bet she was pretty keen . ' Fair , ' Dwight said . Was she , you know , a hot mamma ? ' Aiken tried to grin suggestively on that , as if to say he 'd had plenty of them and knew what it was like , but Dwight had his number . Hot enough , ' he said , condescendingly . Least , enough for what I had in mind . ' He let it ride , then , in spite of Aiken 's curiosity ; and after that Dwight was the authority on women when he and Aiken were together . Dwight got a new pullover sweater with big zigzag horizontal stripes to wear with the trousers of his new suit , and that spring he did n't feel quite so shabby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to taking out a couple of vamps now and then . They talked frequently about calling up somebody in Alpha-Iota or Tri-Bete or one of the other sororities , but , after considering it quite  | gravely , they always came to the conclusion that there was a serious principle involved in things like that : dating a sorority girl would be the same as giving approval to the whole undemocratic fraternitysorority system . So they confined their attentions to barbs who could be picked up in the libe or on the streets around the campus , trying to get under way by eight-thirty at least , because both Lowell 's mother and Aunt Sarah Stiles were capable of making a scene if the boys stayed out after library-closing time . They usually managed to get fairlookers , although of course they could n't be too choosy , and sometimes they had a little trouble between themselves over who would take which girl , especially if one of them was plainly a crock . They would drive out of town and park somewhere on a dark side road and pet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campus when Aiken 's wristwatch said ten minutes to ten . After telling Lowell about his affair with the schoolteacher back in Bethesda , Dwight had a reputation to live up to and had to pull a lot of caveman stuff so Aiken would know he had n't been kidding ; and sometimes he thought Aiken spent more time listening to what went on in the back seat than getting acquainted with his own pickup . Sometimes they dated the same ones two or three times in succession . Once after Dwight had been with a tall blonde named Jennie Hackett several times she made him sore by hinting around about being in love with him . He straightened up in a hurry when she pulled that line on him ; froze up indignantly and told Aiken to get the hell back to town , he had work to do . The Hackett woman bawled all the way back and said she would n't have let him get by with her the way he had if she had n't thought he was serious and liked her a little . Nuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they got to her rooming-house he did n't even bother to go to the door with her . You hear what that chicken tried to pull on me ? ' he asked Lowell as soon as they 'd ditched his dame . She tried to get serious . ' He was honestly bewildered . It 's the damnedest thing I ever heard of . ' Sure , ' Aiken said , her little friend told me Jennie had a crush on you . She thinks you 're the best-looking fellow she ever had a date with . ' Well , I 'll be damned , ' Dwight Craig said . ' I 'll be damned and doubledamned. '  | There was a lot of fun in it , a lot of adventure , never knowing what luck you were going to have when you started out , always hoping to get something really pretty keen , something better than you ever did get , but willing enough to make compromises with your high standards for the sake of the experience you were getting out of it , finding out about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . The boys were very philosophical about it . When a man 's young he 's got to play around like this a little , ' Aiken said . When you 're married and settled down you 'll have to stick to one woman all the rest of your life . ' Sure , ' Dwight said , and think what a kick the bims must get out of it . Nothing to do but study or go to a show or something , and then along come a couple of sheiks in a big car and they get a little romance in their lives . ' Do you think the woman gets as much of a kick out of it as the man does ? ' Hell , yes , ' Dwight said . Only not the same way . It 's all animal with them . Women do n't think about things the way a man does . ' ' l do n't know , ' Aiken reflected . Some women are pretty smart . ' It 's just superficial , ' Dwight said . I never saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a lot of fun in it , and as they approached the end of the semester the thought of spending the summer in Bethesda began to drive Dwight nuts . During the last two weeks of the term he did a little extra apple-polishing around Mrs. Kelleher and in the middle of exam week she told him he could work full-time at the Kookery during the summer for his board and thirty dollars a month besides . It was easy enough to feed her the old applesauce , he 'd found that out , and during the summer he was able to persuade her that when school started again she ought to let him handle the cash-register during the rush at mealtimes , so that she could act as hostess ? it would give the place class and put it in the category of the really swanky restaurants downtown . He got her to buy green linen jackets with big white monograms on the left breast for the boys to wear instead of the old white aprons , and he figured out a number of other little improvements to impress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had a problem with Aunt Martha , of course . She wrote mournful letters about not having him at home that summer , and sometimes he worried about it a little ; but he told himself that sooner or later she  | was going to have to get used to the idea that he was through with Bethesda for good , and that it was really doing her a favor to make it sooner . She 'd just have to get used to it , that was all there was to it . It was n't as if she was n't busy ? she was going to her Normal School in Missouri five days a week , and he wrote her that even if he was at home she would n't see much of him . He told her she 'd have to learn to be sensible about those things . He disciplined himself not to think about her except when he had to write her a letter . The best part of being in the City during the summer was that before it was over he got really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Tiny in a class the second semester and knew him well enough to speak to him on the campus , of course , but one evening when Dwight was eating at the counter old Tim came in and ate with him and afterwards asked Dwight to walk over to the Iota Psi house . When they got there none of Tim 's frat brothers was around , and the two of them sat on the porch talking until nearly midnight . Tim said it was hell being in town during the summer with no women handy except the old maid schoolma'ams who went to summer school ? said he had n't been able to get himself fixed up for a month of Sundays . He said some of the guys went out and bought it when they got hard up , but he 'd never paid for it yet and did n't figure on starting now . He 'd played around with a married woman a little in June ? some biddy out in the West End who 'd picked him up in her Cad once when he was walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but her husband had come back to town at the end of the month and Tim had n't had any luck since . He wanted to know how Dwight was getting by , and Dwight said things had been slow for him , too . Then Tim told him about being in love with a Tri-Bete , a girl named Carol Bingham whom Dwight knew for a swell-looker , and who had accepted Tim 's frat pin just before the end of the last semester . Tim said for some guys hanging a pin was just taking out tail license , but for him it was the works , all the way . Tim asked Dwight if he was engaged yet . Dwight said he thought he was n't quite ready to settle down . Tim said he 'd always been that way himself , but he 'd finally come to the conclusion that he could n't go horsing around all his life . Dwight agreed , and said he envied Tim for having  | found the right girl before it was too late . Tim did n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard or calloused or burned out or something like that . Tim said yeah , he guessed he was pretty lucky . Dwight asked casually if Tiny knew a redheaded Gamma Lam named Hawthorne , and Tim said some of the guys at the house had been out with her once or twice , but he guessed she was cold or something because no one ever seemed to go back the third time . ' You been out with her ? ' No , ' Dwight said . He 'd just seen her around and wondered what she was like . That was the way he 'd figured her , cold as a hunk of ice . Women , Tim said  --  God , that little Tri-Bete of his . He 'd sure be glad when school started again ? or would be , if it was n't for two things , and one of them was trying to stay eligible . He came right out and asked Dwight what kind of grades he got , and Dwight stopped just short of telling Tim he 'd got straight A the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His secret opinion now was that college was a snap , and anybody who could n't make the grade was probably a couple of cuts below a moron ; but for some reason he did n't feel that way about Tim , who seemed to have a lot of respect for anyone who was good at the brain stuff . I got by all right , ' Dwight said . I 've got a system . ' Tim said there was a girl over at the Tri-Bete house named Esther Martin , Carol 's room-mate , whom Dwight ought to get acquainted with because she never got anything lower than a B and they ought to have a lot in common . Dwight could n't place her and told Tim he 'd like to meet her , although he did n't want Tim to get the the idea he was a grind or anything like that ? he 'd just been lucky his first year . Tim said he could fix up a double-date when the girls came back in the fall ? this Esther was a little particular but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dwight thought it would be swell , and then asked Tiny what the other thing was . ' What other thing ? ' ' You said there were two things about school starting again you were n't looking forward to . ' ' Oh , yeah . ' What 's the other one ? ' ' Just the old army game , ' Tim said . Back at the old grind . '  | ' What do you mean ? ' ' Football , for Christ 's sake , and of all the God-damn ways of making a living . ' ' I thought probably you guys got a kick out of it , all those trips and getting your pictures in the paper and everything . ' ' Christ , ' Tiny Tim said . ' Jesus Christ Al-mighty . ' After that Tim dropped in at the Kookery every week or so , and Dwight found out he was serious about arranging a date for him with Esther Martin . It made him feel pretty good , and he wrote an enthusiastic letter to Aunt Martha about getting acquainted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the long serious talks they had together over at the Iota Psi house , the home of the most exclusive fraternity on the Slade campus . He was feeling so pepped-up about everything that he told her that since he could n't get away from his job to visit her in Bethesda , he thought it would be a good idea for her to come to the City to visit him as soon as she 'd finished her work at the Normal . He was a little surprised when she said she 'd come , but he made up his mind really to show her a good time . When he met her at the train in late August , he could n't help being a little knocked out by the way she looked . Being away from her for so long , since Christmas vacation , had made him sort of forget what she was like . In spite of worrying so much all the time she was still putting on weight ; and her clothes were countrified and she looked scared and out-of-place in the City . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he decided that it had been thoughtless and unkind to insist on her coming to see him , and that since the noise and the crowds downtown made her nervous the most considerate thing to do would be just to entertain her at home at Aunt Sarah 's , talking with her evenings about his experiences at college and his plans for the future . It would probably be fun for her simply to sit and visit with Fred and Flora Jackson and Aunt Sarah . He was greatly relieved when she told him she 'd passed all her courses at the Normal School . When the first regular sorority meeting of the year was over , Esther Martin hurried upstairs to the room she shared with Carol  | Bingham with the idea of finishing the story of Martin Arrowsmith for her English course before working out her French assignment for the next morning ; but she had no more than got settled when Carol rushed in and said Tim wanted to know whether he could bring a new sophomore pledge of theirs over to meet her . She said no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gave in , although she could n't for the life of her understand why Carol kept trying to get dates for her , for they never worked out . One date and the fellow was through ? although she did n't mind that much because she usually did n't like the man any better than he liked her . She sighed a little , closed her book , and looked at her watch . Nine-fifteen . The fellows would be over at nine-thirty , and they had to leave at ten-thirty , and in that hour she could have finished with Doctor Martin Arrowsmith . Well , she 'd still have time for the French after ten-thirty if she could keep Carol from chattering about Tim and football and marriage and the new girls they 'd pledged and all the other things she was always running on about . Not that she did n't like Carol ? she thought she was fine , and even looked up to her because she was so pretty and popular and full of pep all the time . But Esther knew she 'd do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more serious around the house . Oh , it was silly , her being a Tri-Bete , she was n't their type , and nobody knew it better than she . I guess I 'm just not anybody 's type , she said to herself , standing before the long mirror , once more bravely facing the fact of her thinness , her plainness , her mousiness . She took off her horn-rimmed glasses , hesitated , and then resolutely replaced them . I guess you might say I 'm just the Esther Martin type . She smiled a little at that , and went downstairs , her small serious face composed , her independence a reliable strength , a weapon she knew . Carol and Tim and Mrs. Hidlay , the house-mother , and this new boy were waiting for her in the big living room , talking together near the fireplace . Bea Marks , the Tri-Bete president , and her Jerry who worked for the newspaper downtown , were on the corner davenport , and two City pledges were chattering to their dates on the center davenport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Sig Ep were whispering together on the piano bench , holding hands , mushylooking ; and from the walls the photographs of half a hundred TriBete  | alums solemnly regarded plain Esther Martin as she moved across the room to the little fireplace group and put her thin hand in gray Mrs. Hidlay 's warm plump one and turned her brown unsmiling eyes upon the vivid girl , Carol Bingham . ' Miss Martin , may I present Mr. Craig , ' funny old Tim said , beating Carol to it because he liked to perform introductions like that ? Carol would just have said Esther this is Joe or Jake or Johnny or whatever the grave-faced good-looking boy 's given name might turn out to be ( why of course , the boy who worked at the Kookery , the terribly polite one ) . How do you do , Mr. Craig . How do you do . ' The polite good-looking boy with the nice voice . It was silly bringing him around for her . ' Esther 's the only girl who gives me any trouble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's on no-privileges half the time . The Dean 's always calling me about her . ' Why , Mother Hidlay , ' Carol Bingham cried , that 's absolutely the biggest lie you ever told . Mr. Craig , you ca n't believe a word Mother Hidlay says , she tells the biggest lies all the time . Esty 's the very finest girl we ever pledged , and I 'm in a position to know because I 'm her room-mate . ' That 's the straight dope , Craig , ' Tim McCoy said . ' That 's the straight stuff , the old straight stuff . ' ' I guess I 'm voted down , ' Mrs. Hidlay smiled . I guess I 'll have to watch where I tell my lies after this . ' You have a nice place here , ' Mr. Craig said . A very nice place . ' Too many girls , though , ' Mrs. Hidlay said . ' A nice enough place if it were n't for all the girls . ' ' Why , Mrs. Hidlay ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Mrs. Hidlay said , mock-sharply . ' We ca n't converse with you two around to interrupt . ' Mother Hidlay , I never heard the like , not even from you . I declare that soniething will simply have to be done about you . ' Scat , ' Mrs. Hidlay said . Carol and Tim moved away , Carol still talking about that awful Mother Hidlay . Well , Mr. Craig , ' Mrs. Hidlay continued , how do you think you 're going to like university life ? '  | ' Mr. Craig was here last year , were n't you , Mr. Craig ? ' Esther said , speaking for the first time since the introduction . Yes , ' Mr. Craig said , and Esther wondered why he flushed up so . I think it 's wise , ' Mrs. Hidlay said swiftly , not to pledge until your second year . Freshman rushing is so confusing , and not one in ten of the boys really knows where his tastes lie . And there 's no studying to be done around a fraternity house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the house , ' Mr. Craig said . I 've heard the girls say Iota Psi is crowded this year . I think you 're fortunate , Mr. Craig , however you may feel about it now . May I inquire about your work ? ? about your major , for instance ? ' ' I think it 's going to be business and economics , ' Mr. Craig said gravely . ' Although I 'm considering law pretty seriously , too . ' ' You have a fine courtroom voice , ' Mrs. Hidlay ' said . She studied him a moment . ' I always like to get acquainted with our boys . I 'll look forward to seeing you again some time . Be a good girl , Esther . ' She left them , and they stood a moment , facing each other awkwardly , and Esther realized suddenly that Mr. Craig was shy . ' It 's nice out on the front porch , ' she said . But the front porch was already taken , very much taken , and Esther asked Mr. Craig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And they went down the steps , and slowly , silently across the deep lawn under the old elms and sycamores , and turned out on the sidewalk , and Esther was thinking how obvious Carol was , how obvious she 'd always been , trying to find a man for her , and she imagined how Carol and Tim must have talked it over , discussing it gravely , would n't it be nice if we could find a man who would really take a liking to poor Esther , poor plain Esther Martin . They were so silly about it , a couple of sillies , thinking that she cared a rap . ' Mr. Craig , I 'd like to know what Tim told you about me . ' She looked at him slyly , and there was just enough light from the streetlamp at the corner for her to get a glimpse of the funny expression on his face as he tried to make up an answer . Esther supposed that it was saying direct things like that quite as much as her reputation for studiousness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care . If people did n't want to take her the way she was , well , then , they just did n't need to take her , and that was that .  | ' He said a lot of nice things about you . He told me about you once last summer and gave you a big buildup . ' ' I know what he told you , ' Esther said . ' He told you I was a grind and said I was slow . Why did you want a date with me ? ' ' He did n't say you were slow . ' ' He thought it , then , and so did you . ' ' I did n't think about it . Anyway , I like girls with brains . I 'm fed up with all these empty-headed flappers . ' ' That 's because you 're so smart yourself . ' He did n't know how to respond to that , and Esther felt a little remorseful . He seemed nice enough and he was working his way through school and that meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just joking , ' she said . He was silent for a while and she was afraid she had really hurt his feelings , and was surprised when he finally did speak . ' Look , ' he said , ' how about coming to our pledge dance a week from Saturday night ? ' ' Do n't do anything you 'll be sorry for afterward , ' Esther said . ' I 'm the one who 's putting out the invitation . ' ' I 'd like to come , Mr. Craig , ' Esther said , for the first time feeling shy with him . ' Thank you very much . ' That was how it began . Esther tried to pretend she was n't at all interested in this Dwight Craig , but she went downtown the following Saturday and bought a new dress and the night of the dance she used a little color on her face and almost made up her mind not to wear her glasses , although she did ? she was n't going to start making a fool of herself now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little worried because Dwight had n't traded many dances and she was afraid it was because he could n't ; but she did n't say anything about it ( ordinarily she would have , that was the way she was , that was the way she had to be ) , and on the way home in the back seat of the car Tim had rented Dwight did n't try to get fresh , and she decided that perhaps he was pretty nice . Before he left he made a chapel date with her for Tuesday morning . Before very long the girls at the house were including Dwight and her in their plans for movie dates and picnics and football games , and  | in spite of telling herself she was a silly little fool , Esther liked it . And she was afraid she liked Dwight Craig . He had a lot of good features ? she 'd defy anyone to say that he had n't . He was hardworking and serious and he had brains . But he was manly , too , he was n't just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little sometimes even around her and said he was an atheist , although Esther thought that was just putting-on ; he believed in something , she was sure of that . And she thought it was probably natural for a boy like Dwight , with his good looks and all his talent and ambition , to be a little conceited . There were a lot worse things than conceit , and because she did n't have any herself Esther rather admired Dwight for having a little self-confidence . She knew what it was not to have it . Sometimes he got pretty angry about things , though  --  especially when he thought someone had treated him unfairly . The way he turned against Tim , for instance , when Tim began to run around with Jake Mannheimer and Pat Elwyn and Sammy Saltow , and Dwight said it was because they had a lot of dough and Tim was just out to feather his own nest . It was hard for Esther to blame him , because she did n't like Jake and Pat and Sammy herself , and she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pledged them . They all had cars and they wore expensive clothes and sported big coonskin coats and went around acting as if they owned the whole world . And some of the girls said it was actually dangerous to go out with them , they were rough and strong and did n't seem to have any respect for a girl at all . The incident even caused a little coolness between Esther and Carol , for Carol stood up for Pat and Sammy and Jake since Tim had taken to going around with them , and Esther was simply too honest to make any pretense of agreeing with her when she talked favorably about those boys . And she could n't help being worried by Dwight 's bitterness ? the way he seemed to hate those boys was really a little alarming . He never called Jake Mannheimer by name , for instance ? Jake was always just that damn like . ' Esther did n't much like Jews , either , but violent feeling always shocked her , and she did n't really see why Jake was any worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know anything about it , that he 'd had plenty of experience with Jews and they were all the same , scheming and overbearing . He said  | Jake was the worst of the three because he 'd end up on top the way Jews always did . The other two , Pat and Sammy , were nothing much to worry about because they 'd hit the gutter eventually , anyway , in spite of all their money . As for Tim , Dwight said to hell with him , he 'd never amount to anything either ; and it was n't until Carol finally had a long heart-toheart talk with both of them that Dwight relented in his attitude toward Tiny . It was one chilly afternoon in November when the three of them walked home from the library together and stopped at the drugstore near the house for hot chocolate . Carol was completely unlike herself , silent and depressed , and when Esther said it was too bad Tim was n't there with them she cut loose and swore a blue streak ? Esther could tell that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be with them if it was n't for football practice , and football would probably make a tramp out of him the way it did out of everybody except maybe the coaches , and she did n't see what chance they had of ever getting married and having a decent home the way she 'd always dreamed . She was terribly worked up , and Esther could n't have stopped her even if she 'd wanted to . I know everybody 's talking about the way Tim 's taken up with those three pledges , but put yourselves in his shoes . What 's he got to look forward to when he gets out of school ? He has to play football to get his tuition and keep that job , and then football takes so much time there is n't any left for studying , and when he gets through he wo n't have a profession or anything . ' Esther interrupted to ask why he could n't get a high-school coaching job , but Carol just laughed sarcastically and asked her if she could imagine Tiny Tim McCoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . Teaching 's just a quick trip to the poorhouse anyway , ' Dwight said . Well , ' Carol went on , the only chance he has is to make some friends while he 's here who can do him some good on the outside , and  --  well , how can you blame him ? Jake 's father is one of the biggest stockholders in Garbstein 's , and the Saltow brothers have the largest stock-and-bond business in town , and , well , old man Elwyn 's got his finger in just about everything . Tim 's got to be nice to them . I 've been awfully low about the way you 've been feeling about it ? I know Dwight 's been thinking awful things about Tim .  | I do n't know whether you realize it or not , but Tim kind of looks up to you , Dwight , because you 're smart in classes , and , well , that 's the way it is . ' Carol 's eyes were all filled up and Esther tried to think of something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dwight for the strong way in which he expressed himself . Hell , ' he said ? it seemed as if he always had to swear when he was serious about something , but Esther was beginning to get used to it ? hell , old Tim 's just playing it smart , and I say power to him . You 've got to do stuff like that if you 're going to get by in this world . I figured he 'd just been playing it smart all the way along . ' Esther knew he was just saying such things to make Carol feel better , she knew he was n't really that cynical about life , and she saw that Carol appreciated it , although of course she still felt pretty low . The worst of it is , that those three fellows are just making over Tim now because he 's been having a pretty good season , and he gets all those writeups in the papers and his pictures spread all over everything and all that . I 'd be willing to bet they 'll drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Tim so , too , but he got mad and said I did n't know what I was talking about . Well , we 'll just wait and see . I guess there 's nothing for any of us to do but wait and see . ' Dwight was n't quite so bitter against Tim after that , but Esther was afraid that it might have left a scar , and she did n't want him to become really cynical . When he was n't pretending to be hard and disillusioned he was awfully nice . Sometimes when he forgot himself , for instance , and smiled at her , it was so sort of boyish and sweet she felt warm all over . By Christmas time she had decided she was pretty serious about him . She went home early for the holidays and her mother helped her pick out a tie to send him and they exchanged two or three letters before they returned to school . He wrote wonderful letters , and there was a passage in his last one that she read over and over again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town of Bethesda always made him feel , and then : Last night I walked in the snow from one end of this provincial little hamlet to the other , thinking of all the meanness and hypocrisy in the world , and when I got back to our place I decided I had to do  | something about it , so I found a stick and wrote Iota Psi and Beta Beta Beta in the snow . It looked pretty good there in the moonlight , although I guess it 's not the first time they 've been joined together that way . There was just time for her to get a reply back to him before he returned to the City , but she had an awfully hard time saying something that would let him know how she felt without appearing forward or seeming to read more into what he had said than he intended . She finally contrived something at the very end of her letter that she had to let stand , although she was far from satisfied with it , for in comparison with the clever subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They do look nice together , do n't they ? Meaning the Greek letters . As if you could n't guess what I meant ! Maybe some day  --  Well , I better not continue . Just close by saying I 've begun to count the days till next Sunday night ! It was only a little after seven when he got out to Aunt Sarah 's , but the nightlock was on and he had to ring the doorbell for a full two minutes before Flora finally let him in . ' I was beginning to think you 'd all kicked the bucket , ' he said . Flora answered him querulously . Do n't talk like that ? what if Aunt Sarah 'd hear you ? ' All right , what if she did ? he asked himself , as he started upstairs with his suitcase . What the old lady thought meant less and less to him every day of the year , and the time was coming when he was going to tell the whole family off and move over to the house with the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been scared of her ? had wondered about that ever since the first night they 'd had it out about the late hours he 'd been keeping since he 'd pledged Iota Psi . He 'd stood up to her then because he had to , and about halfway through the scene had suddenly realized he was getting a plenty big kick out of it , and when it came to a good hot argument he was just about a match for her . Since then he 'd stayed away from the place as much as possible , and he thought that if he got a decent job next summer he could save enough money to afford the rent at the lote house , and then the hell with the old lady forever . He pulled a clean shirt and  | a fresh tie out of his suitcase and wrapped them in a newspaper and made his way softly back down the stairs and out the front door . He stopped at the Kookery to report his return and then continued to the Tote house to clean up and see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dead as a morgue . He called the station , found that Esther 's train would be late because of a blizzard somewhere north of the City , and played with the idea of trying to rent a car ? it was too cold a night to do much walking . After thinking it over , though , he decided to give Lowell Aiken a ring . He had n't seen much of him since he 'd gone into the frat , and it would be interesting to know whether Aiken was holding it against him . Aiken sounded okay on the phone and said it was keen Dwight had called , because he had a date but it was n't for an hour or so yet and he 'd been bored all day . Dwight said that was nothing , he 'd been bored for two weeks , and how about coming around to the house and shooting the bull for a while . Maybe they could fix up something . He went upstairs then and filled a tub with hot water and undressed and dove into it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a town where you ca n't even take a civilized bath . He was still in the tub when Aiken got there . While he was dressing he told him he had to meet his girl at the train in about an hour and Aiken got the point and said why not make a double-date of it and that was that . When Dwight was dressed there was still some time before Aiken had to go after his bim , and they sat downstairs and gassed awhile . Aiken said he 'd changed a lot , had sort of settled down , quit all that fooling around they 'd done last spring , was going steady and bearing down on the old books and figured he was going to make a straight B record that semester . Going into Law , and that was a tough grind and he had to get a running start on it . Dwight said he 'd played with the idea of becoming a lawyer at one time , but had decided that lawyers were a glut on the market and lately he 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is , not at first , but the actuarial end of it . Math 's sort of a snap for me , and I guess I might as well make use of it . Of course actuaries usually just get a salary , so I would n't want to stay in that very long , but the way I see it is this . You get established as an actuary with a good outfit , and then when  | the time comes you can work into the really big selling and can skip all that small-time house-to-house stuff ? I 've got a broken-down cousin-by-marriage doing that and he 's been broke all his life . The thing to do for a man with any brains is to get into a position where you can go out after the really fat policies ? a thousand- or twothousand-buck commission on every damn policy you sell , that 's the kind of thing I 'm interested in . No sense being a sucker all your life . ' Aiken was impressed . He was impressed by Dwight 's bigtime ideas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pledged anything and never would ? and of course he was impressed by the fact that Dwight was going around with a Tri-Bete . ' Remember when we used to take out all those crumbs ? ' he asked , and Dwight said he 'd have a hell of a hard time forgetting it . Aiken said his girl was a little Zeta Beta who lived in town , and Dwight said he guessed the Zetas had some pretty nice girls . If she 'd been a Delta Rho , now ? everybody knew the Delta Rho place was just a red-light joint . Aiken laughed a little , and then , his face quickly solemn , went back to the Zeta Betes . They were n't society , he said , like the Tri-Betes and Gamma-Lams and those , but they were serious-minded and nice and he guessed he was n't cut out to travel the fast society pace anyway . ' I guess I 'm just a hick , kind of , and I 'll probably end up a hicktown lawyer . But Frances , that 's this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon live in a small town . ' ' Jesus , ' Dwight said , you must be getting serious . ' Aiken grinned like an idiot and said he thought he probably was at that . ' From what I hear I guess you 're getting pretty serious yourself . ' Dwight frowned . ' Well , maybe I am , ' he said . ' Of course there 's a pretty nice atmosphere around the Tri-Bete house , a mighty pleasant place to go and relax . I 'm over there so much I feel almost like an active member sometimes . ' It 's pretty wonderful , ' Aiken said , failing to get the point . Settling down and ? being serious , I mean . It 's just like those poems you read . ' For God 's sake , Dwight said to himself , looking at him . For the love of God . They picked up Aiken 's girl at her home and the three of them rode together in the front seat on the way to the Union Station . Dwight could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark but he  | knew from the way they were squeezed together that she was plenty broad across the beam , and as for being clever or a good conversationalist or anything like that ? well , she might as well have been a deaf-mute . At the station she and Aiken went inside with him , and when Dwight saw her in the light he told himself Aiken did n't know what it was all about . Lord , Esther was a queen . And she did look good when she got off the train . She had a new coat with a big fur collar that came way up around the back of her head and a cute little hat he 'd never seen before and some new glasses ? rimless with gold bows instead of the tortoise-shell things she 'd always worn . After that wench of Aiken 's , Esther looked trim and graceful and refined . She did n't seem to have much to say , but the way she looked at him made him feel good . He saw that Aiken 's girl was impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and told them that Esther was tired and he thought they 'd better catch a streetcar and go right out to the Tri-Bete house . Esther found his hand and gave it a little Mrs. Hidlay was alone in the living room when they arrived . She was always lording it around , always in the way , and Dwight could never figure out why Esther had such a crush on her . She said four or five of the girls had returned from their vacations but they had all gone downtown to see the Harold Lloyd picture . Esther excused herself and went upstairs with her bag , leaving him there with Mrs. Hidlay , who hung around and jabbered on about how good it was to have the girls coming back and how odd it was they could have so much snow in Dwight 's part of the state without getting any at all in the City although according to the evening paper there was a blizzard moving down from the north , until he thought he 'd go nuts . Esther finally came back downstairs , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in a few minutes Mrs. Hidlay had the sense to squeeze ; and when old Aiken said he would n't think of letting them take the streetcar he put his arm around Esther and drew her over to him and kissed her on the cheek . Her face was cold and she was quiet in his arms and they rode in silence all the way out to the house and Dwight was hoping it would be deserted when they got there .  | leave them alone ; and suddenly Dwight himself felt embarrassed and awkward . Esther asked why she had never met Mr. Aiken before , and Dwight mumbled something about never having known him so awfully well , but he 'd run into him down at the Kookery that evening and had n't been able to shake him . Pause . ' He seemed terribly nice . ' ' I guess he 's all right . That girl of his is rather absurd , though . ' ' You ca n't tell , she might be very nice if you got to know her . ' ' l @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie . ' ' Oh , Dwight , I was afraid it was awful . Your gift was nice , it was lovely . I shall always prize it . ' Her voice was almost a whisper on the last sentence , and then without having to plan it at all he took her hand and pulled her up from the sofa and led her into the den off the dining room and there in the darkness he put both arms around her and kissed her for the first time on the mouth . Her lips were dry , mouth small and feathery , under his . He heard the first gust of an approaching wind strike the window near them , and it seemed a little lighter in the room now . He lifted the girl 's face and saw it small and white and solemn , and he felt that this was probably something quite special , and he returned her gaze for a long moment before he lowered his head from his superior height and kissed her a second time . He felt her smallness and reflected quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the small grateful girl and the tall handsome man , and when he looked into her grave eyes again his own expression was more solemn than before , one eyebrow lifted a little , before he pressed her to him and held her slightness strongly and bravely . And then with a gentle pressure he led her to the sofa there in the darkened den and beside her on the soft plushness of the sofa he once more guided her mouth to his . She stirred , then , and he waited , and when next her face came against his she was without her glasses and he was finally confident of her , and , with some sense of his bold tenderness , his skill and experience in love , he kissed her eyes , the soft closed lids . And then there was the taste of tears upon his mouth . He hesitated , holding her . ' Dwight . ' He thought it better not to speak , only lifting her face enough to bring her small whisper close to his ear .  | ' I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mailed it but now I 'm glad . ' Which one ? ' He felt her stiffen a little in his arms , and he had to speak ' again before she would continue . ' Which letter do you mean ? ' ' Oh , Dwight , the last one of course ? Dwight , did n't you get it ? ' They 'll forward it , ' he said quickly . What was in it ? ' She tried to pull away from him , but he held her tightly and finally she spoke . Dwight , I thought this was because ? because you 'd read my letter and knew how ? knew how I felt . ' He did n't get it . ' I know how you feel . ' He tried to kiss her again . ' What 's the matter ? ? I guess I know how you feel . ' His shoulder was beginning to ache because of the awkwardness of their position . She whispered rapidly . I 've never done anything like this before . Dwight , I 've never gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mean something before I did things like this . Do you understand , do you know what it means ? ' His physical discomfort had grown , and he had to move . He brought her around on his lap facing him , firmly , pressing against her reluctance , and , his hand strong upon the back of her small head , her fine soft hair , once more he kissed her . Then , because of her silence , her disconcerting remoteness , he told her that what it probably meant was that they liked each other quite a lot . ' Oh , Dwight , ' she whispered quickly , it 's more serious than that , for me it 's more serious than that , it has to be for me . ' Well , what the hell , he thought . We 've been going together for three months and it 's the first time I 've even touched her . He pressed her face into the rough lapel of his jacket and held her there , feeling alone , feeling like the only guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window rattled in the wind . The girl resisted him , withdrew from his arms , and he let her go , he let her sit erect beside him , a separate person . He felt uncomfortable . He felt more lonely than before . He thought how nice it had been to be able to come around to this house with the other fellows whenever he felt like it . The girl rose from the davenport . He was suddenly afraid , afraid  | she was going to leave him there alone in the room , afraid she would leave the room before he had had time to think about it . He saw the movement of her hands , and realized that she had replaced her glasses . Then he remembered the softness of her face , and once more the wind blasted the window , and he thought how bad it would be for her if they broke up now . And he felt a sudden warm appreciation of what now he was about to do , what a wonderful thing for her . To have withheld it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever , misunderstanding him , to make the gift . Swiftly , confidently , he arose and went to her . He took her hands . ' Esty , ' he said . Finally she looked at him ; and then disengaged one hand and timidly touched a corner of his mouth . ' Smile , ' she whispered . ' I guess I 'd feel all right if you 'd smile at me . ' They saw each other every day . They had a standing chapel date and they waited for each other after classes and sat together in the libe , and Dwight spent three evenings a week at the Tri-Bete house ? Esther said no more than that because she did n't want anything to interfere with his studying . Dwight told her that as far as all that was concerned she certainly had nothing to worry about . Everyone knew that college standards had sunk to the level of the mass mind , and the mass mind being what it was there was n't much sense in worrying about the competition . Esther said she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though she knew he did n't mean it quite the way it sounded . He spent two or three nights a week at the Iote house , and he and Tiny Tim , who had finally decided he did n't have any use for the wealthy pledges he 'd been running around with in the fall , had several long serious talks about themselves . He told Tim that he thought it was a good idea for a man to try to be objective about love . For instance , he knew that Esty was n't exactly a beauty , and probably a lot of the fellows did n't understand exactly what he saw in her . Well , one of the things about Esty was her really amazing insight into human nature ? she was n't easily taken in by people . The way she saw through him , Dwight Craig , for instance . ' I guess most people probably think I 'm pretty egotistic . Well , Esther sees through all that .  | You 'll get a kick out of this , but she says that actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course that 's a hell of a word to use for a man . What she means is that I 've got an inferiority complex , and , you know , I guess she 's absolutely right . And if it had n't been for Esty I 'd probably never have understood what was wrong with me . ' Later he decided that perhaps he 'd been mistaken in saying the other fellows did n't know what he saw in Esther , because nearly all of them told him at one time or another how lucky he was to have a girl like her , and if they ever found out he was n't treating her right they 'd see to it personally that he got the hell knocked out of him . They said she was a fine serious-minded girl , the kind of girl a man would never have to worry about . Dwight listened to them thoughtfully , agreed with them , and came to the conclusion that his affair had dignity . Thereafter he cultivated a certain solemnity of manner when they , appeared in public together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against anything boisterous or adolescent in manner . He gave Esther advice from time to time about clothes . Esther said that before she 'd met him she 'd been willing to wear just any old thing , but now she wanted to look nice for him . He suggested that the next time she went shopping for a dress or hat or anything like that , he 'd like to go along . He spent an afternoon with her at Garbstein 's , advising her on little problems of color and style , not letting the salesladies get away with anything . After they had settled on a dress , Esther wanted to stop at the hosiery department ; but Dwight said there was a woman clerking there who was sort of a relative of his , and he 'd just as soon not get involved in a conversation with her because she was tiresome and hard to get away from . Then he asked Esther if she 'd ever thought of using a little more makeup . He guided her to the cosmetics counter . One night he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the campus , and Dwight of course said he thought Carol Bingham was . Tim said he used to think so himself , but after you saw a girl without makeup once or twice you had to change some of your ideas . Tim 's candidate for the Slade beauty queen was that redheaded Gamma Lam , Helen Hawthorne ? he 'd always liked redheads ,  | and Hawthorne certainly had the best pair of legs on the campus . Tim said the funny thing about it was , though , that a hot looker like Hawthorne could still be cold as an icicle . None of the fellows had ever got to first base with her . On the other hand , it could be that she 'd never had the right line pulled on her . Sometime he 'd like to sneak out on Carol and try his technique on Hawthorne . He 'd like to take her out some place , too , out to dinner at the McKinley or somewhere . You ever notice how all the guys in a place like that break their damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his arm ? I always get a kick out of it when Carol fixes up a little and we go stepping out and that happens . Only of course to a stranger that Hawthorne would come closer to knocking them dead than Carol . ' Tim suddenly wanted to know why the hell Craig was looking so down in the dumps . Dwight said he did n't know he had been . Tim said he 'd been looking as if he 'd just lost his last friend . Dwight said the trouble with a dame like Hawthorne was that she was so God-damn stuck-up nobody could get along with her . And probably dumb , dumb as an ox . He 'd never heard it took any particular brains to pound the piano . As far as he was concerned , he 'd take somebody like Esty any day in the year . Tim said he was glad to hear that Dwight knew just how God-damn lucky he was . 2 Iota Psi alums who lived in the City had the habit of dropping in at the house on Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best clothes ( S ' men , of course , in their maroon sweaters with the big white letter ) , and welcomed their guests solemnly at the door with the fraternal handclasp , and , Sunday after Sunday , gravely discussed the same subjects with them : Slade athletic prospects , the future of the fraternity , the romantic alliances of the active brothers , campus politics , and business conditions ' downtown . ' No brother underestimated the importance of being present at the house on Sunday afternoons .  | After the ordeal of his initiation in the late winter of his sophomore year , Dwight Craig never missed one of those solemn conclaves , although he seldom escaped the Stiles house without a shrill denunciation from Aunt Sarah for his ungodly Sunday behavior . That , however , could be easily forgotten ; and as he approached the old house each Sunday afternoon he felt more keenly than at any other time what high promise the future held for him . Once there , however , in the actual presence of his brothers and their guests , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bitterly sure of it ) of humiliation , of secret rage , and of despair . On his approach in his brave buoyancy he saw himself at various times playing slightly different roles against the secure fraternal background , but all were constructed for the same final effect : the gift of respect , the reward of genuine acceptance in the Sunday circle . It did not work out that way . For reasons he never understood , he continued to feel , even after his initiation , like an outsider at those weekend gatherings ; and it was not until the spring of that year that he at last found a role that he could play with some success on the Iota Psi stage . ( He himself thought of the problem in theatrical terms because , at Esther 's urging , he had tried out for the all-university play in February ; and , for his performance of the small part he had been given , he had earned not only Esther 's warmly tremulous admiration but the public praise of the director , Professor Frederic Wilkinson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for himself for use at the Iota Psi house was that of the fraternity deep one , ' the silent , enigmatic philosopher , a self-sufficient spirit necessarily a little withdrawn from the frivolous life around him . The man who speaks only after a solemn preliminary of careful consideration . The steady one , still waters running deep . The question-mark man . He would arrive early , shortly after the Sunday dishes had been cleared from the long table in the dining room by the white-coated menials , the board-job brothers . Bareheaded , straight-stem pipe clenched between strong teeth , trouser-crease sharp from the morning iron , he would mount the porch steps slowly , erect and unsmiling , and , perhaps , if there were gossipers on the porch , he would spend a few minutes there relaxed against the balustrade , giving casual attention to  | the bright evening-date talk . He would empty his pipe in a rapid series of sharp little raps on the white porch-rail , and refill it with slow but deft fingers , pausing from time to time to cock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out before continuing with the important business of getting a good pipe properly packed . He would light up , cupping careful hands against the faintly stirring afternoon breeze , and perhaps consider the burning match for a grave moment or two before shaking it out and dropping it , with something of Galileo , something of Newton , in his attentive mien , to the flowerbed below him . And he would smoke for a while , from time to time giving to the talk what only it could be worth in the estimation of such a man ? a small smile . And then , a little bored , a little restless in spite of his steady devotion to his own purposes , he would remove himself from the railing and silently enter the house , silently sink into a cool worn chair on the fringe of another small circle of the voluble . Would grimace slightly with impatience at himself for his forgetfulness , and arise to fetch a smoking-stand . Would once more empty the warm pipe , once more refill and light it ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ futile , nothing exchanged for nothing , there at that post he would remain until the alums began to arrive . There were all kinds of Iota Psi alums . Life had not worked out the same for all of them . There were smooth ones and shabby ones , shining ones and gray ones , the triumphant and the whipped , the half-whipped and the almost-triumphant . But Iota Psi was a democratic brotherhood , a smiling , practical democracy was one of the Ten Ideals of Iota Psi Fraternity , ' and if there were small differences of manner in the treatment given the several Sunday visitors , they were hardly noticeable , and quite unconscious . Of all the active brothers , the ' deep one , ' Dwight Craig , lived up most rigorously to Ideal Number Five of Iota Psi . His behavior was the same with all of the Sunday visitors . He was always the last to give the secret grip to the new arrival , and each time it was accompanied by a silent solemn nod of the head . He stood his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pleasantries , busy with his pipe . When all the guests were  | finally absorbed into one large living-room circle , he might be found in a prominent situation , might be seated near the most witty or expressive of the visitors ; but it was invariably a quiet prominence , and , if his opinion on a topic was wanted , it would have to be pressed for . And , when the pressure was applied , the ' deep one ' never was guilty of a careless , unworthy response . He would look sharply , sharply but of course not truculently , at his interrogator , his persistent inquisitor , to reassure himself of the speaker 's genuine seriousness , and then study his pipe-bowl , watching the lazy drifting smoke , and perhaps run a hand through his hair in an absent , slightly awkward gesture ; and frown a little , and hesitate , and shake his head , once . Then : ' Well , really . ' And a small frozen pause for attention . ' Really , I 'd say that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on a number of things . I mean , well , it 's a question that ca n't be definitely answered one way or the other . You 've got to consider all sides , and , well , I 'm afraid I have n't quite made up my mind . ' He found , when it was most skillfully brought off , that nearly all of the older men would , out of their rich experience , nod their heads in grave agreement with such a judicious statement ; and , as the year drew to its close , his opinions upon matters of moment were more and more frequently invited . Strategically , it was a good season for such wise ( and yet modest ) maneuvering : fall was football time , winter belonged to basketball , but spring had only track and was the time for philosophers . Dwight Craig developed confidence , and , as the summer approached , began to devote some attention to practical problems . He cultivated the acquaintance of Harley Murdock , the alum who owned ' Murdock 's for Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Harley Murdock also had a reputation for being a deep one . ' He was a small , gray , lean-faced man who always appeared at Iota Psi Sunday afternoons in sharply creased striped trousers , black jacket with square padded shoulders , an immaculate starched collar , and light gray spats , and he always looked freshly barbered . He had been a dependable miler as an undergraduate , but now no brother ever found him greatly talkative on any subject ; and , if it had n't simply been the most natural and expected thing in the world for all oldtimers  | to put in their Sunday appearances , there might have been some conjecture about the reason for Harley Murdock 's visits . For he would enter in his splendor , and sit smoking his Murads for an hour , and leave , with hardly a word to anyone , and hardly even a flicker of interest in his small direct gray eyes . Dwight Craig formed the habit of finding a chair near him when he came , and matching Harley Murdock 's silence with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do ? ' Murdock asked him one day , so softly that no one else heard . And repeated it . What do you do on the campus ? ' Dwight slowly removed his pipe from his mouth . Nothing much , I 'm afraid . ' He shrugged , and made a small gesture . Dramatics , though , a little . Rather more next year , if I can find the time for it . ' Murdock watched him , studied his tie , the crease in his trousers , the drape of his lapels . Just for the experience , of course . I expect to make my career in the business world . ' Murdock 's eyes went out of focus . Dwight hoped he had not gone too far . On the following Sunday he was already seated when Murdock entered , but the man of his own accord chose the vacant chair beside him . It was thirty minutes before he spoke , before he looked briefly at Dwight and said : Home 's in the City , I suppose , since you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Dwight said . Working ? ' ' Yes , but I 'm thinking of making a change . ' That was all that day , but the next time Dwight came to the house Tim McCoy buttonholed him . ' You know Cork Corwin 's probably flunking out this year ? ' ' I suppose I did hear that , ' Dwight said , but I never thought much about it . ' Got any interest in his job down at Murdock 's ? ' I guess I had n't thought about it , really . Is n't it athletic ? ' Way I hear it , ' Tiny said , the old man 's had a bellyful of " S " men . Another thing I heard was that Murdock 's got his eye on you . ' Well , I 'll be damned , ' Dwight said . ' I 'll be God-damned. '  | ' Only Murdock says he wonders if you can get the lead out of your ass . Says he wants somebody he can depend on , but on the other hand he do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like an owl around the house lately . ' Dwight sat by Harley Murdock . ' Funny thing , ' he said , about this college business . I let some things slide when I was working in that play , and the last few weeks they damn near made a grind out of me , catching up in my course work . Night after night until two or three in the morning funny thing . I got so I was going around in a daze . ' ' Have trouble with your studies ? ' Dwight looked at him . He smiled . ' I 'm about average , I guess . Nothing for anyone to be scared of . On the other hand I suppose I do n't have to do much worrying . ' He looked across the room , and got suddenly to his feet . ' Excuse me a moment ? there 's a guy I 've got to see . Matter of great importance , a little date at the Tri-Bete house . ' When he returned to Murdock 's side he talked learnedly about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a call from Harley Murdock . There was nothing of reticence in the man 's manner in his office at ' Murdock 's for Men . ' ' I 'm going to try you out down here if you think you 'd like the job . I 've had these football tramps around for four or five years now , and when it began I was n't thinking of charity exactly . I thought those bums would pull in some campus business for me and maybe the sport-page publicity would be a good thing for the store . Well , it 's been nothing but a headache , and you 're so damn serious I got to thinking of you ? kind of running to extremes , maybe . Then I got to worrying because you were n't exactly a mixer , or that 's what I thought until a week or two ago . Now I do n't know , but I 'll give you a short try at it . In a business like this you 've got to get along with everyone . ' ' Well , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer . ' ' We 'll see how you work out and worry about next year later . If you 're okay , I 'd want you to keep up that drama work out there . It 's one way of keeping the store in the public eye . Maybe not as good as  | football , but still better than nothing . Twenty a week to start , and later maybe a commission . ' ' I 'll try my best to make good at it . I 've always been interested in clothes . ' ' I 've noticed that , ' Harley Murdock said . ' Working here , you 'll save a little dough on them . ' He started at Murdock 's before the end of the term , working Saturdays , and found it easier than he had expected to rub Harley 's customers the right way . Only the prosperous came into the store , only confident gentlemen who had well-defined tastes that nearly always coincided with his own , and it was almost a pleasure to help them with their problems of selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requested , to gossip with them pleasantly about other matters when it was n't . He took to reading the sports section of the daily paper in order to be ready for the baseball fans , and he cultivated his smile . Harley Murdock finally said he thought he 'd do . ' Only there 's one thing ? what the hell 's going on between you and my other men ? ' Dwight looked surprise . ' Why ? nothing , nothing at all . What do you mean , the other men ? ' ' Falkner says you think you 're too good for them ? you 'd better take care of that . There are clerks down there who 've forgotten more than you 'll ever know about this business . ' ' I guess I 've just been too busy ? learning the ropes and everything . ' ' Try to learn all the ropes . Look , if it turned out you were going to be my campus representative next year , any chance your moving into the house ? ' ' Yes , ' Dwight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of doing it this summer . ' Quitting at the Kookery had been a pleasure , and he had done it with a gratifying flourish ; but removing himself from the Stiles house precipitated a violent and shameful scene with the old lady that lingered in his memory for weeks . ' All right , then , ' she cried at him , her old voice tremulous , ' go , get  | out , and do n't come back , and may the loving Christ have mercy on your crooked soul ! ' Her black eyes flashed up at him out of her white , lined face , and her thin lips worked as she struggled for control . He was a head taller than she , now . I 've watched you through the years , I 've seen you work your sly little tricks , I know all about your deceitfulness and your sinful pride . It 's your father 's blood in you , and your mother 's too for all I know ? the father ca n't take all the blame . And your mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never seen through your ? your childish ? precocious ? duplicity . Poor woman , she 's reaping her harvest now , she 's getting her reward of neglect and cruelty . Oh , you 're a fine one , you are , and if I did n't have you on my conscience , you and your blood , I 'd say good riddance , and I hope I 've seen the last of you ! But I 'll pray for you , I 'll go on with it , like an old fool , I 'll go on praying . But prayer takes faith , boy , do you know that ? ? prayer without faith is a sin and a shame . Faith ? faith ? pah ! I 've no faith in the Lord 's power over you , you rejected God with your first act of pride , and there 's nothing I can do for you , or the dear Christ either . Go , then , go ? get out ! But sin 's suffering , did you know that , boy ? Sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think you 're after ? sin 's suffering , and heartache , and destruction . You 'll suffer , boy , you 'll have a hard life , there 's no happiness in sin , only weeping , and wailing , and eternal gnashing of teeth . That 's your lot , boy ? and go , now . Go before I forget myself , go before the blackness comes into my own heart . Go , go , do you hear me ? Go now ! ' Well , he tried to tell himself afterward , it was n't any worse than some of the others . There 'd been plenty of tirades from the old girl to match that one , plenty of others , even when I was still a kid and did n't know what it was all about ? plenty of them to match it and maybe worse . This was just a final bonus , a little extra dividend , something thrown in free , on the house , at the end of a long and happy association . But why the hell has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has she always gone out of her way to take a crack at me ? What does she think I ever did to her ? He found no answers to these questions ; but when he received Aunt Martha 's reply to the letter he had written announcing his intention  | of staying in the City again during the summer , and was faced with the problem of answering it , he thought bitterly of the other aunt 's last words to him , heard again the passion with which they were spoken , and submitted finally to their hard prophetic force . He sat alone at his desk in the empty fraternity house with Aunt Martha 's letter before him , and once more read it through . If he could come to Bethesda for only one month that summer , she 'd pay him whatever he 'd make in the clothing store for that time . Maybe they could buy a car , a secondhand car , for him to use . She felt she had to have him there for a while ? longer than a week-end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a house he liked . Could n't he come for a month , if she 'd pay him what he 'd make in the store ? No , he said aloud in the silence . No , not now or ever again . I ca n't . They would n't let me go at Murdock 's , not without resigning they would n't . Anyway , I ca n't go down there now , I ca n't ? maybe a week-end later , maybe once in a while a week-end . She ought to understand I ca n't , if she had any sense she 'd understand . I 'm through with that place down there forever , and the sooner she finds it out the better it 'll be for both of us . Then he remembered the other one , the prophetic old lady . Your father 's blood in you , and your aunt 's reaping her harvest . You rejected God , and sin 's suffering and heartache . All right , then , he said to himself . Hell , I would n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old bitch down . If that 's the way she 's got me figured I guess that 's the way I better be , with all that bad blood she 's always raved about . Anyhow , it 's the way I 've got to be . I 've got this start here now , and I ca n't let anything interfere with it . A man 's got to keep his eye on the ball . When I explain it to Aunt Martha she 'll see the point quickly enough . She 's not so dumb , and I 'll tell her it 's what she 's always wanted for me , always said she wanted . She was probably just in a mood when she wrote this letter , she 's probably writing another one telling me not to worry . But what if she 's not ? What if she keeps on pestering me ? Well , then , she 'd better find out right now , she 'd better start getting used  | to the idea . The brave thing to do now 's to write and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to tell her the plain truth . He picked up his pen and began to write : Dear Aunt Martha , I do n't know how you 'll feel about what I guess I 've got to say . But I think if you try to see things from my point of view you 'll see that the best thing for me to do is stay here ' on the job ' and ' keep my nose to the grindstone ' ? although that last sounds as if I were slaving away in a hardware store instead of the smartest men 's shop ( haberdashery ) in the City . But what I wanted to say was that from now on I 'm just not going to have the time to come down there as often as I 'd like to , because to make the most of my opportunities here I 've got to be on the job every minute of the time . Maybe before the summer 's over I can get away for a week-end , but then take things like Christmas holidays ? a time like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's for Men . ' I 'm afraid you 're going to have to get used to the idea that ... In the fall of Dwight 's junior year at Slade he was given the lead in that season 's major dramatic production . He finished his first reading of the play convinced that , if in some ways he was not yet exactly like Rodney Miracle , Rodney Miracle was the model upon which he would do everything in his power to shape himself in the future . Rodney Miracle was a character of great sophistication and shining elegance . He was a man who went through life more than a little wearily , since , thanks to the brutal crassness of modern society and the monotonous persistence with which beautiful and wealthy women threw themselves at his distinguished head , he had long since lost all of his illusions . A caustic epigrammatist , Rodney Miracle had managed to reduce his wisdom on all subjects to a set of tired little bon mots , which , when delivered just so , were calculated to set the whole tone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? thus did a sardonic God impale us on the point of his joke . . . Our political system , my dear Carlo , is simply a device for the elevation of knaves , charlatans , and clowns into positions of power . It is not worthy of your attention . . . Behold the puritan ! His ' morality ' is not only  | against nature . It is something infinitely worse . It is a bore . . . . How quaint are the Americans ! They invent a social system calculated to rub the nerves raw , and then deprive themselves by law of their most convenient anaesthetic . They call it prohibition . ( Not all of Rodney Miracle 's lines could be spoken on the stage of the Slade theatre , of course . Professor Wilkinson knew he would have to use the censor 's pencil even before rehearsals could be started . It was the heaviest cross he had to bear at Slade . ) Dwight Craig thought Rodney Miracle magnificent , and was stricken with a profound sense of the responsibility he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself the instrument by means of which so much wit and wisdom and charm were to be communicated to the play 's audience . In a spirit of deep humility he went to Professor Wilkinson 's office , and asked what he could do to prepare himself for his task . The director studied the boy with one eyebrow raised , his chin cushioned in the palm of his long , narrow hand . His flannel suit as usual was rumpled and shapeless , but the points of his slightly soiled shirt-collar were at least an inch longer than anything Dwight had been able to buy even at Murdock 's for Men , and the boy felt his sartorial inferiority , just as he felt , whenever he heard Professor Wilkinson speak , the vulgarity of his own Midwestern diction . I presume ? ah ? that you wish me to be entirely honest . You know , I suppose , that ? ah ? the successful interpretation of a character like Rodney Miracle is more than a matter of , shall we say ? ? stage business . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , when Professor Wilkinson had paused , significantly . ' You mean there has to be a psychological understanding . ' ' Something of the sort , ' Professor Wilkinson said in his bored voice . ' Yes , rather . And I may as well say right now that ? ah ? I 'm not a little concerned , I might even say disturbed , about just how well your Rodney Miracle is going to develop , is going to grow . ' I 'll work hard , ' Dwight said . ' I 'll work my damned head off . ' The director 's boredom suddenly disappeared , his hand descended from chin to desk top with a sharp little slap , he moved forward in his  | chair , and his eyebrows came together in a frown , small but intense . Say that again , ' he said . ' Go on , say it again . I think it 's ? ah ? perhaps significant . ' ' I 'll work my damned head off . ' ' Ex-actly . But what I want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage portrait of a man as subtle and worldly-wise as Rodney Miracle by  --  as you put it ? simply working your ? ah ? head off . Rodney must be easy , bored , charming , he must have ? have ? ah ? an essence . Can you create an essence by hard work ? No , naturally not . Rodney Miracle must come to life as effortlessly as a flower emerging from its bud . ' With his hands Professor Wilkinson made the bud , opened the flower . ' Now , how do you think you can bring that about ? ' ' I do n't know exactly , ' Dwight said . But I 'll do anything you say . ' A small fear suddenly shaped itself in his mind . Unless ? unless you think maybe I 'm not cut out for the ? for the part ? ' It has to be you , ' Frederic Wilkinson said , wearily . ' There is no one else . ' He took a wadded handkerchief from the breast pocket of his coat and wiped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was confidential . ' I think you need experience . You are not naive ? I have noticed that ? t but I suspect you are not exactly sophisticated , either . ' ' What  --  what can I do ? ' You might , I think , for one thing , do a little reading . ' The director closed his eyes . His blond lashes were long and curled a little at the ends . He opened them . Did you ever hear of James Gibbon Huneker ? ' ' I guess not . ' Begin with Huneker ? his Painted Veils , a sly , charming little work . You wo n't find it , naturally , in our ? ah ? provincial library , but I 'll lend you my copy . Huneker was very much like Rodney Miracle . ' ' Is he dead ? ' Naturally . He was an incredibly sensitive man , and he lived in America . Then , let me see , after Huneker , I should say some verse , some Wilde , perhaps , and some Dowson . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in this century , although possibly  | a little ? ah ? abstruse , in places . And get acquainted with a man named Kemp , Harry Kemp , a charmingly emancipated creature ? Tramping on Life his book is called . And ? ah ? perhaps some of the classics , things like the Heptameron of Margaret of Navarre , Balzac 's Contes Drolatiques , and sturdy old Rabelais . ' I 'll have to get some of these names from you again . I 'm afraid I 'm really pretty uneducated . ' Yes , yes , of course , ' the director said , a little impatiently . Then he gave the boy a long look of appraisal , a look that made Dwight slightly uncomfortable . But reading alone will not transform you into Rodney Miracle . I 'm afraid now I must ask you a very frank question . How ? ah ? extensive has your experience been ? ' Well , I ? I do n't know . I guess I do n't exactly know what you mean . ' A look of something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never mind , ' he said curtly . Never mind about that , then . ' He stared through the window for a few moments , and then returned to Dwight . Incidentally , ' he said , and dropped his eyes to the row of books on his desk , how do you like the idea of playing opposite Miss Ulster ? ' ' I think she 's all right . I think we 'll probably work together okay . ' I 'm quite sure you will . ' Professor Wilkinson raised his eyes , and smiled . Between the two of us , I 'm of the opinion that Miss Ulster 's talent may leave something , a little something , to be desired . Her talent for acting , that is . I believe her talent in certain ? ah ? other lines is ? shall we say ? ? quite highly developed . ' Dwight felt it proper to laugh quite loudly at this , and Professor Wilkinson joined him . That 's good , ' Dwight said . That 's damned good . ' However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his handkerchief , what I intended to say was that although she does n't project as well as she might , I 'm very glad I have her for this particular role . Most of the young women I 've seen on this campus would be simply incongruous in the part . ' To say the least , ' Dwight Craig said . ' To say the very least . ' And now I think that 's all I ? ah ? have to say . For the time being , at any rate . '  | ' Well , ' Dwight said , ' thanks for your advice . I think I 've got a lot of ? understanding out of , well , everything you 've said . ' He got to his feet , turned to leave , and hesitated . ' I guess I 'm a little stupid , but there in the second act where I sit down and play something on the piano ? what do we do there , cut that part out ? ' ' We 'll fake it , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plays . ' Fake it ? ' the boy said . ' Fake it how ? ' ' We 'll get somebody from the Conservatory to fake it for you offstage . ' ' Oh , ' Dwight said . ' Well , that 's one way of getting to be a musician in a hurry . ' There was still Esther . ' Look , Esty , ' he said to her one afternoon over their coffee at the Kookery . ' I guess I 'm going through a kind of crisis . I guess you 'll just have to try and understand . ' She was silent for a moment before she answered him , and her calm eyes made Dwight uncomfortable . Esther had been strange , lately ? pretty difficult , when you came right down to it . She was even more quiet than she had been when he had first known her , and there were times when she seemed almost indifferent when he tried to talk with her . If it had not been for a certain frantic intensity he felt in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have imagined she was no longer in love with him . ' I have been trying , ' she said finally . ' Ever since the beginning of the year . ' ' You do n't need to be sarcastic about it . ' ' I 'm not , Dwight . I do try . ' ' What 's the matter , then ? ' ' What were you going to say ? about going through a crisis ? ' ' I do n't think you care very much about listening to it . ' She placed her index finger on the handle of her empty cup , and , very carefully , turned it around upon its saucer . ' I do , ' she said . ' Well , ' he said sullenly , ' if you 're really interested , this is what I mean . ' He tried to explain it to her . He began with the only book among  | those recommended by Professor Wilkinson that he had remembered , and dutifully bought , and tried to read , the novel South Wind , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for Esther because there were so many things in it he did n't understand . He fell back on the device of trying to tell her how it made him feel , and with that he was a little more successful . He told her it had opened his eyes ; had helped him get wise to himself ; had made him realize that he had been pretty mid-Victorian ' all of his life , that he had got to be a junior in college without ever being really emancipated . ' He said that even that clodhopper from his home town , Clay Ferguson , was closer to being emancipated than he was , that Clay Ferguson had read this book of Douglas 's when he was a sophomore and had told him that it had changed his whole life . In what way ? ' Esther wanted to know . Well , ' Dwight said , with the air of repeating a precious confidence , ' I think he 's already emancipated , for one thing . ' Esther asked about that . She said she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell her . He said it meant getting rid of your illusions about life . Not taking things for granted , he said . ? Oh , he said , suddenly finding the right word , it means getting rid of your middle-class inhibitions . You were either inhibited or emancipated , he told her , you were either one or the other ; and he spoke of Miss Wilberforce , and the peculiar method she had of throwing off her inhibitions . Esther said Miss Wilberforce sounded a little vulgar . Dwight told her scornfully that a remark like that simply proved that she had as many inhibitions as he himself had once had . He abandoned the book and tried to tell her about the crowd that Clay Ferguson ran around with . He told her about Harold Swan , who had had a poem published in a magazine in Chicago and was perhaps the most famous undergraduate in Clay Ferguson 's crowd . Swan , according to Ferguson , thought that the eighteenth century was the most charming ' of all the great ages of history ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn to take snuff in the eighteenth-century manner . Esther said that Harold Swan sounded a little silly , but Dwight told her sternly that that was just a middleclass reaction .  | Then , he said , there were some other fellows from the college , all of them people who were trying to do something , something important , like writing and things like that . ' There was even one young faculty member who ran around with them sometimes , Mr. Hodgson , Mike Hodgson , one of the English instructors . Esther wanted to know if he was n't pretty old to be mixed up with people our age . ' Dwight told her stiffly that age had nothing to do with it , a man was just as old as his experience , and some people at twenty were really a lot older than their parents even . Besides , he added , there were a lot of older people in Clay Ferguson 's crowd ? or rather , Harold Swan 's crowd , for Dwight guessed that Ferguson was n't really quite in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . Some of them he was quite anxious to meet , because they were interested , as he was , in the theater , they did things ' in the Community Playhouse out in the West End . People , most of them , with plenty of dough , but emancipated and interested in doing something important . ' A fellow named Leseur , he said , who wrote poetry ? he was thinking of bringing out a book of poetry almost any time now . And Van Morrison , who had an important business downtown but was n't really interested in anything but book collecting , and another fellow by the name of Westerman who was supposed to know more about printing , about fine type , than anyone else in the country probably . Interesting , ' Dwight Craig said . They were all interesting people , people he 'd like to know . Esther asked him why he did n't get this friend of his , Clay Ferguson , to introduce him to them sometime . I would n't ask him , Dwight told her contemptuously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a damn thing . Anyway , he told her moodily , those people probably would n't care anything about meeting him . He was still a long way from complete emancipation . He still had too much to learn . Esther looked at him . Dwight , ' she said . Does being emancipated mean telling the truth about everything ? ' ' Of course , ' he said . That 's an important part of it . ' Then tell me the truth now , Dwight , ' she said . She picked up a spoon , and he saw it tremble a little in her hand . Quickly she put it down . ' Do you want us to ? do you want us to go on ? '
