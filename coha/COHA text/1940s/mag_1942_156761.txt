To answer some of the questions our subscribers have been asking about how TIME gathers , verifies , writes and distributes its news . <P> What do you think ? . . . Should we change the name of TIME 'S business news department from " Business &; Finance " to something more up-to-date like " U. S. at Work " ? <P> Right now this section is trying to do a double job for you : <P> ( 1 ) Trying to give you a better idea of how American business is helping to win the war and make America a better place to live in ; <P> ( 2 ) and trying to keep you posted well in advance on the changes war and the government are imposing on business . <P> To do this job Business &; Finance , like every department of TIME , has its own staff of writers and researchers . This fall TIME 'S Business staff consists of nine specialists working in New York . In addition , three men in the Washington office are kept busy full time covering business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our correspondents in other cities were picked because of their special understanding of local business conditions . <P> This is a lot of staff for a department that shows up in TME each week with about ten columns of type , but almost half of all TIME 'S more than a million copies a week go to business executives who may be basing important decisions on reports in TIME 'S Business department . And that is just one of several reasons why we consider it doubly important that everything you read in Business should be straight and sound and foresighted . <P> The Business editor of TIME is John Davenport , who was for years a star writer on FORTUNE . On the staff are-La Rue Applegate , six years on the Business staff of the New York Times ; Perry Githens , three years news editor of Business Week ; Emeline Nollen , who used to be an ace FORTUNE researcher , and Penrose Scull , our widely-quoted transportation expert , who for ten years had his own world-wide freight-forwarding business . <P> The head researcher is Marion Rice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under her are Anne Powers , who was five years with Standard Statistics-and Julia Wilson and Elisabeth Brockway , both of whom had long experience as research experts in Wall Street . <P> In recent months this staff has documented for our Business section some of the most-important stories TIME has carried . They took the lead in highlighting the critical scrap shortage in steel and the critical manpower shortage in copper . They were first to detail the dramatic expansion of American aviation all over the world and the imminence of hourly flights from New York to London . They were among the first to point up the need of meat rationing and coffee rationing and the foolishness of sugar rationing ; the end of the aluminum shortage , the approach of the lumber shortage , and the nonexistence of the wool shortage . They foresaw the nationwide crisis in small business and the Washington chaos in raw materials . And months ago they showed that by year 's end manpower would emerge as " the one big barrier holding back the U.S. war effort . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
