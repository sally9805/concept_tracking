txt The rapidly accelerating American and British demand for all types of power-driven , metal-working machinery will soon absorb the entire American output , thus leaving none for export to Japan , according to Commerce Department and Defense Commission sources . Emphatically denying that there is any current embargo on the shipment of such vitally important machinery to Japan , officials believe that it is but a matter of few months at the very outside when a " natural " embargo upon their export , except to Great Britain , will result from America 's own defense needs . These predictions are buttressed by figures showing that the United States 's present metal-working machinery capacity is far below that necessary to meet the orders which are expected to develop when the country 's $10,000,000,000-plus defense program is really under way and when Britain begins to take shipment of the vast amounts of machinery she has ordered from American manufacturers . Estimates on Capacity Unofficial although reliable estimates place the United States 's current metal-working machinery capacity at $450,000,000 worth , with the possibility that the next 18 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is believed that as against this productive capacity the United States will soon develop an annual need ranging from $800,000,000 to $800,000,000 . In addition , there is the as yet unestimated need of the British Empire which is believed to total well over $100,000,000 . Thus , officials here hold that American production will fall short of meeting American demands by $100,000,000 at the very minimum and that this shortage will be general in all categories of power-driven , metal-working machinery , making it impossible under the export license system to ship any significant amount of material to Japan . Although the United States may have to defer filling some of its own needs at the beginning , it is understood , Britain will be given practical priority with this country in the matter of such machinery on the grounds that the longer and more vigorously Britain defends itself the more ( line this country will have to perfect its own defenses . British Imports Rise That Britain is not counting on the United States in vain to supply it with the machinery which it hopes will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , superiority over Germany is seen here in a recent Commerce Department report that British imports of metal-working machinery from the United States rose by 60 per cent during the month of August . Similar reports demonstrate the extent to which Japan is dependent upon the United States for its imports of metal  --  working machinery . Since the United States , Great Britain , and Germany are the only large-scale manufacturers of such machinery , the European war has left this country as the only remaining market open to Japan . During the first seven months of this year Japan imported $16 , - 988,000 worth of metal-working machinery from the United States as compared with $15,063,000 worth during the same period in 1939 , In addition , exports of this equipment to Japan from the United States totaled $2,150,000 during August , Sino-Japanese War Commerce Department figures show that a few years ago Japan 's purchases of metal-working machinery in the United States regularly averaged around ; 3,000,000 , but that in 1937  --  the year in which Sino-Japanese war broke out  --  Japanese purchases jumped to $11,904,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of $24,578,000 in 1939 , despite the fact that Japan 's supply of foreign credits was declining rapidly . If Japanese purchases of this equipment for 1940 were to continue at the rate established for the first eight months of this year , they would reach a new high of approximately $29,000,000 , it is revealed . American and British needs are seen as a guarantee against any such result . While stating categoilcally that there is no other source of metalworking machinery now open to Japan in the world , officials hero do not predict that a cessation of American exports will seriously hamper Japan 's war effort immediately . They warn that the huge jump in Japanese purchases during the past three or four years may have enabled Japan to accumulate large reserves .
