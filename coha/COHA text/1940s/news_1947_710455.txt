txt I WASHINGTON , June 2 ? The House gave its approval by 220 to 99 today to the bill reducing personal income taxes by 10.5 to 30 per cent , starting July 1 . The ' Senate is scheduled to complete Congressional action on this No. 1 item in the Republican program tomorrow and to send it to the White House for President Truman 's signature or his veto . Speculation in Congress continued to lean toward disapproval by the White House . In such an event , it was conceded almost generally , a veto would stand . Republican leaders repeated that if this effort for tax slashes failed there would be no further attempts this year . Representative Harold Knutson , chairman of the Ways and Means Committee , said after the vote : " Tax reduction is now up to the President , as far as the House is concerned . I firmly believe that he will allow HR 1 the tax measure to become law , because it is the thing to do . " If the President chooses to veto HR 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppressive wartime rates and the economy of the country will be held back at a time when it is vital that it move ahead . I do not believe he will wish to assume that responsibility . " Today 's vote of 220 to 99 , which // was on the conference adjustment of Senate and House differences , was at a ratio that could easily override a veto . It was stronger than that which prevailed on March 27 when the House passed its own bill , seeking to begin the cuts as of Jan. 1 last . Then it was 273 to 137 , and it lacked only a fraction of a vote for providing the two-thirds majority required to enact a bill despite Presidential disapproval . Today there was the two-thirds , with votes to spare . Doughton Votes With GOP Only one Republican , Rep. Merlin Hull of Wisconsin , a former Progressive , left the GOP reservation . In March , three Republicans vote " no . " Today two of them voted " aye . " Supporting the conference agreement were 183 Republicans and thirty-seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of North Carolina , the former Ways and Means Committee chairman . Opposing were ninetyseven Democrats , Vito Marcantonio , American Labor member of New York , and Mr. Hull . The measure , however , faces a different situation in the Senate . On May 28 , when the Upper House passed the bill in the form in which , with little change , it survived the conference , the vote was 52 to 34 . It lacked five votes of providing a two-thirds majority . Since then , influential Democrats who supported the original measure , such as Senator Walter F. George of Georgia , former Finance Committee chairman , have indicated that they would not , however , vote to override a . Presidential veto if it came . The measure provides for tax reductions , starting July 1 , as follows : For persons with annual taxable income  --  that is , after exemptions and deductions , of $1,000 or less , the cut would be by 30 per cent . This reduction would apply , as examples , to unmarried persons with total earnings , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would apply also to married persons without children with an annual gross of $2,222 . Included also would be married couples with one child and a gross income up to $2,777 , or with two children and a gross of up to $3,333 . For persons with a taxable income ranging between $1,000 and around $1,400 , following the factors given above , there would be a fiat tax reduction of $67 , or a 20 per cent slash in tax payment , whichever is more . For persons in income brackets between $1,400 and $137,000 the 20 per cent cut is provided . For those in the $137,000 to $302,000 range a cut of 15 per cent would prevail . On any income above $302,000 the reduction would be at 10.5 per cent . The present ceiling of 85.5 per cent at which any income , no matter how great , could be taxed , would be reduced in the pending legislation to 81 per cent this year and to 76.5 per cent in 1948 . Persons who have passed the age of 65 would have an additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1,000 . In final House debate today ( a veto vote is taken without debate ) two Democratic members of the Ways and Means Committee , Representatives John J. Dingell of Michigan and Herman P. Eberharter of Pennsylvania , urged the President to veto the bill . The House also heard Mr. Doughton , who was chairman of the committee through many New Deal years , call for its acceptance at the White House . On the Republican side , Representative Albert J. Engel of Michigan , who had bitterly fought the original measure , continued to argue that the pending plan was " not the proper approach to tax reduction . " He said he believed . as strongly as ever that " the only fair plan " would be to increase family exemptions . However , he voted for the conference report . After tomorrow , it appeared , the decision would be left entirely with the White House . Whichever way this decision goes it was conceded widely- at the Capitol , much would be made of it , on both the Republican and the Democratic sides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
