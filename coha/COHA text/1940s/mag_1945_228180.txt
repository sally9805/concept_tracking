Right back in the groove after getting out of the Army , 132-lb . Ben Hogan , the man with the delayed wrist-lash , still could belt a golf ball out of sight . On the fairways , he never made a careless shot . His ability to concentrate was hard to believe . Once again he was a man to beat on the pro circuit . <P> After romping home first in the Nashville Open , 19 strokes below par , the wasp-waisted Texan headed for Dallas . En route last week , he came down with flu , gobbled some sulfa pills , decided to play anyhow . Despite a 102 fever , he fired a 68 to tie for the first-round lead in the $10.000 Dallas Open . But next day , woozy from sulfa , he slumped to 74 . After that he could not catch Sam Snead ( lately recovered from a broken arm ) , Jug Mc-Spaden or Byron Nelson . Hogan finished fourth with a 3-under-par . In the longer run he was a good bet to succeed wartime golf 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 Ibs. underweight after the nerve-wearing grind of winning 16 tournaments within a year .
