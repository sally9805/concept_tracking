In almost every rural public school in Kansas last week , at 2:15 in the afternoon , the schoolchildren were shushed into silence by their teachers , then heard from a loudspeaker : <P> " The Radio Classroom ! . . . Hello , boys and girls . . . . Are you getting just the sort of food you need ? How many vitamins are you getting ? Enough ? Can you have too many ? What about the water you drink ? Is it safe ? Are you sure ? " <P> So began the hygiene lesson-15 minutes ' worth . Other days , pupils got an equivalent dose of social studies , science , art or music . <P> The mind behind the loudspeakers is R. Russell Porter 's , radio director of Kansas State Teachers College , Emporia . He wanted to do something to improve Kansas ' remote rural schools . He got free time from a local station , but discovered that most rural schools had no radios . Since then Parent-Teacher Associations and similar groups have rounded up receivers , finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave free time . If the idea pans out , Kansas scholars may have more such classes-but no one expects that an announcer will ever replace the teacher .
