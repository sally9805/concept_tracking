Aware of this , Four-Star General Omar Nelson Bradley came to a sharp decision when he took over the Veterans Administration : hospitals would henceforth be built near big city medical schools .

The hospital is not fireproof , and it is within 37 miles of another Veterans ' Hospital ( prewar , pork-barrel style ) in another small town , Muskogee . VA plans call for a new 1,000-bed building in Oklahoma City . But the Senator was looking for a fight . " If the VA does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will ask why when they come before the Senate for more money . ... " <P> General Bradley replied to the challenge in language any Senator could understand . Said he : " If appropriations are not voted for veterans it will be very clear indeed who did n't vote them . . . . " * <P> * For news of VA v. private pork , see BUSINESS .
