As the war of nerves raged on , General Dwight D. Eisenhower launched a new air campaign against Germany . He assigned officers of his staff to broadcast his first direct orders to the underground fighters of Occupied Europe . Patriots were warned to listen carefully to their speaker 's voice , to recognize it in the future , and never to by fooled by Nazi announcers . <P> As his first operational instruction , the Allied Supreme Commander told underground workers to be prepared to give Allied troops the fullest possible information on German troop movements , the numbers of men and the specific organizations involved . Other items : the location of supply and ammunition dumps , the districts that have been mined or booby-trapped , the bridges that have been prepared by the Germans for demolition . <P> In his message , booming out to the enslaved Continent in six languages , General Eisenhower told the men &; women of the underground that he was counting on them " as part of the great force now being marshaled to inflict the final defeat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Interim Threats . Meanwhile the Nazis-were busy announcing to the world that Portsmouth , Plymouth , Bristol and the Port of London were " bristling-positively crammed to the bursting point-with all manner of invasion equipment . " The German radio also threatened to bomb all these concentrations into oblivion . <P> German planes did venture over England four nights running . But their mission was seemingly reconnaissance in force rather than wholehearted attack . Fifteen out of 100 Nazi raiders were shot down in the biggest of the operations . Whatever information these reconnaissance raids could bring in was gratefully received . The Nazis were up to their ears in guessing games about the gathering invasion storm . Their Paris radio said that the Allies were massing " 50 divisions and 80,000 airborne troops " for the invasion . Neutral Swedish sources went into even greater detail , presumably on German information . They said that the Allies had piled up some 50 British and Empire divisions in the United Kingdom , 40 to 50 U.S. divisions , front-line air strength of nearly 10,000 planes , 10,000,000 tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasion storm was still a threat , however imminent , war in the west was real enough to the men already fighting it . <P> After a lull during vile weather , the air war against Germany picked up in full force as 1,500 U.S. planes attacked Berlin and Brunswick , forcing the Luftwaffe fighter command into a savage battle which cost 125 Nazi fighters against 26 U.S. bombers and 19 fighters .
