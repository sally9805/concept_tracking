NAUSEA ( 238 pp. ) - Jean- Paul Sartre - New Directions ( $3 ) . <P> WHAT Is LITERATURE ? ( 306 pp. ) - Jean- Paul Sartre - Philosophical Library ( $4.75 ) . <P> To the U.S. public , the writing career of Existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre has unreeled itself both forward and backward in the past five years . His latest plays ( or what is left of them after translation ) have been produced in Manhattan , while publishers have busied themselves resurrecting his prewar fiction . His second book , The Wall , a volume of short stories first published in France in 1939 , was brought out in the U.S. last year ( TIME , Dec. 27 ) . It is now followed by his first and most famous novel , Nausea , a book that made a splash among Paris intellectuals in 1938 . Sartre 's recent essays in What Is Literature ? are , by comparison , distinguished for their sanity . <P> Nausea is the expression in fiction of Sartre 's response to being alive . Descartes , who titillated the 17th Century intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Augustine 's premise : " I think , therefore I am . " Sartre 's fundamental observation , an overstatement of something found in the writings of Kierkegaard and the German existentialist , Heidegger , may be paraphrased as " I exist and find it sickening . " The experience recounted in Nausea is one of deep physical and metaphysical horror , well beyond the ennui , already sufficiently sick , that such French post-romantic writers as Baudelaire liked to wallow in . <P> Sweaty Me . The novel is in the form of a diary kept by a solitary scholar in 1932 in a French provincial town . Starting with mild expressions of disgust at existence , the entries run a truly resourceful gamut of the grotesque , the dispiriting , and the desperate . There is not a human being in the book who is not in some way loathsome , and the hyperconsciousness of the diarist soon gets to the point of seeing everything in a light both ghastly and obscene . One of Novelist Sartre 's revelations : <P> " I see my hand spread out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . It is lying on its back . It shows me its fat belly . It looks like an animal turned upside down . The fingers are the paws . I amuse myself by moving them very rapidly , like the claws of a crab which has fallen on its back . . . I ca n't suppress it , nor can I suppress the rest of my body , the sweaty warmth which soils my shirt . . . If I exist , it is because I am horrified at existing . I am the one who pulls myself from the nothingness to which I aspire : the hatred , the disgust of existing . . . " <P> Sartre 's writing is occasionally much better than this pathological reverie , and in spots the book has an ingenuity and sharpness of detail worthy of first-rate talent . But the paradox of the central vision in Nausea is so forced and barefaced that most readers will not be able to accept it as anything but a perversion of the truth , a degenerated twisting of the classic experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
