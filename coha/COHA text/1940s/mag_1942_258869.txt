By one of those historical accidents wherein an author , an idea and a ready public all collide at the right instant , Lieut . Colonel William F. Kernan became a nationally quoted strategist overnight . His Defense Will Not Win the War ( Little , Brown ; $1.50 ) , a fast , hot , rough- &-tumble; book that people could eat up , hit the bookstands when everyone was saying the same thing . <P> Colonel Kernan is dead sure that Hitler can be beaten only by going after him , smashing him , routing his armies . His thesis is simple : the U.S. , Britain and France relied too long on defense outposts ( Singapore , Hong Kong ) , defense lines ( the Maginot for France , the oceans for the U.S. ) , the classic seapower doctrines of Admiral Mahan . ( One chapter title : " Mahan Was Wrong ! " ) France fell because the French and British generals were gripped by the " defense myth . " So fell Singapore , Hong Kong and the Philippines . Kernan pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allies had held nowhere . <P> " It is impossible to hold any possession , island or base , by a defense whose principal buttress is an existing sea supremacy . Unless the foundations of victory are laid by the formation of an adequate land army . . . mere sea power ... is useless except for rescue work . . . . " ( Cf. Dunkirk , Crete ) . <P> Colonel Kernan says that if the U.S. keeps on the defensive , it will keep losing to the Axis . " We think . . . that all we have to do to stop Hitler is to step up the output of our ' defense industry , ' increase the output of tanks and planes , train more and more flyers . . . induct more and more selectees , build an ever-increasing number of battleships , spend more and more billions , arm every defending democracy to the teeth , line the pockets of every enemy of Hitler with our gold . . . . <P> " It is not enough . . . . <P> " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force . . . that can take care of , crush , capture and absorb any amount of war material , tanks , planes , guns , trucks , munitions-as long as that material is used defensively . " <P> How To Win . Colonel Kernan 's formula for victory is a return to the slashing tactics of Napoleon , Wellington , Marshal Foch ( whose Conduct of War he has translated ) . * His battle slogan is the famed dispatch from Foch at the First Battle of the Marne : " My right is exposed , my left is heavily attacked , my center is unable to hold its position , I can not redistribute my forces . The situation is excellent . I shall attack . " <P> Says Kernan : wars are not won or lost in outposts like the Philippines ; they are decided in headlong clashes at the great centers of military strength . His own plan is for a U.S.-British offense against Italy ( " the solar plexus of the Axis " ) this spring , using three-fourths of the U.S. Fleet , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every transport of both nations , an A.E.F. of 200,000 men a month .
