Sugar was in a nut house all last week . Even Government bureaus bickered with one another . <P> WPB jolted Washington with its bland statement that consumer sugar stocks were " only slightly below normal " and that there was no need for rationing . Up jumped the Agriculture Department : " Sugar for use in the continental U.S. is expected to be the smallest in 20 years . " Then , with a so-there flip of its head , the Department added : " Rationing is necessary . " OPA-which doled out the 130,000,000 sugar-ration cards-quickly and emphatically agreed . <P> All this hithering &; thithering threw refiners and consumers into a dither . Most of them wanted to believe WPB-and acted accordingly . Thus some U.S. refiners last week put customers back on an easy-payment basis ( 31 days instead of hard cash ) , wired buyers to come and get it . California 's giant Spreckels Sugar went a step further , cut prices ten points to 5-35 a lb. to lure customers . Finally OPA told Western beet-sugar outfits to stop shipping sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Most housewives , meanwhile , were taking rationing in their stride . Bakers , candy makers and soda-pop makers ( cut to 70% of 1941 use ) got along with substitutes , complete elimination of some lines , and good old American ingenuity . But restaurants and hotels ( slashed to 50% of 1941 consumption ) howled for more . <P> Maybe they will get it . According to the Agricultural Department 's own figures , there were 2,137,000 tons of sugar in the U.S. at year 's end . Since then imports ( mostly Cuba and Hawaii ) have totaled 1,200,000 tons . Domestic cane and beet output runs over 2,000,000 tons a year . Each week , even now , from 60-70,000 tons are imported . Besides , Cuba is nervously holding 3,000,000-plus tons only 200 miles from Florida and the waiting railroads ; Puerto Rico has up to 1,000,000 tons more . Normal U.S. consumption , meantime , runs only 6,800,000 tons annually , v. only 5,500,000 tons allowed under present sugar rationing . <P> The only people really scared by sugar rationing are sugar producers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tooth , seriously curtail the whole sugar industry . Sniffing this Cuba 's powerful National Sugar Producers Association this week rushed over to the U.S Ambassador in Havana , asked him to stop the " U.S. campaign against sugar " - pronto.
