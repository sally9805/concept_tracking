STARS ON THE SEA-F. van Wyck Mason-Lippincotf ( $2.75 ) . The season 's most successful costume fiction and plenty of it , concerned with the fledgling glories of the U. S. fleet at Newport , Charleston and Santo Domingo in the brave days of ' 76 . F. van Wyck Mason has the prettiest ear extant for racy Colonial speech ; his sense of character is lively , though it is closer to The American Boy than to perfection ; his yarns are rattling good , and if anyone wants to see where the romantic conception of an Indian fighter has got to in the last century , he need only compare Deerslayer with Mr. Mason 's tough , wenching Sam Higsby . <P> LIFE IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS-Warren Angus Ferris-Rocky Mountain Bookshop , Salt Lake City ( $3 ) . At 19 , Ferris joined a party of trappers that set out from St. Louis in February , 1830 , and went to work north of Great Salt Lake . Ferris stayed alive for five winters . His journal , expanded when he got home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Messenger , is one of the rarest and best documents of its kind ; this is its first complete publication .
