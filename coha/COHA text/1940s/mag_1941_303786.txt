The U.S. must go back to school . If U.S. defense factories are to work around the clock seven days a week , at least 3,000,000 more workers must be trained within a year . <P> In Boston , where the American Vocational Association convened last week , the men in charge of this job faced its staggering dimensions . They thought they had already performed miracles . U.S. Education Commissioner John W. Studebaker reported work done : 1,776,000 trained for defense jobs in 17 months ( 29 times the number trained in World War I ) . Congress had appropriated $183,622,000 for their training . Of the nation 's 1,200 busy vocational schools , half were at work 24 hours a day . <P> But this was now only a beginning . Lieut . Colonel Frank J. McSherry , U.S. Director of Defense Training , told the teachers that to equip and supply one soldier in this war , 14 industrial workers are needed . Greatest need : in shipbuilding , aircraft , ordnance , welding , machine operators , radio and instrument assemblers . <P> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 85,000 training stations ( each station : a lathe , drill press or other machine at which a worker can be trained in one skill ) . Even working in three shifts , turning out partly trained mechanics in six to eight weeks , they were not enough . But Colonel McSherry had a plan . <P> Breakdown . His plan , already fact in many factories : break down jobs and training to simpler operations . E.g. , although it takes two years to train a machinist , an unskilled hand can be taught to run a lathe ( a machinist 's first lesson ) in six to eight weeks at school . Then he graduates to a factory , begins at once to produce on his lathe . Thereafter he progresses , under instruction from a factory foreman and in night school , to drill press , shaper , planer , grinder , milling and screw machine . Advantages of this system : 1 ) training is much faster , 2 ) trainees produce while they learn , 3 ) fewer teachers are needed . <P> The Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of supervisors . Factories and 144 U.S. engineering colleges are training some ( Lockheed has 2,300 in a training school ) , but level heads and leadership are not produced overnight . <P> Last week the pattern of the U.S. people 's coming re-education was already visible in many places : <P> &gt; Busiest educational center was Detroit , where 16,000 men &; women ( more than in New York City and Chicago combined ) went to classes in the public schools , thousands more were in training in factories , 10,000 more waited their turns . While Detroit 's great auto factories retooled for tanks and planes , their workers studied plane welding , tank assembling , parachute making , etc . Lights in 30 Detroit schools blazed all night . Factories gave foremen leaves of absence to teach in the schools ; some paid their workers full wages to go to school for more training . <P> &gt; In Seattle , feverishly at work training shipbuilders and planebuilders ( Boeing ) , the blackout stopped night classes temporarily . But the schools quickly came to the decision that training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or no air raids .
