After 78 days of committee consideration and two days of debate on the floor , the House last week approved U.S. participation in the Bretton Woods monetary program . On the final vote , party lines dissolved : 138 Republicans joined with 205 Democrats ( and two minor party members ) to pass , the bill , 345-to-18 . ( The dissenters were all G.O.P. bitter-enders . ) The overwhelming vote was due to : 1 ) educational spadework by the Treasury Department ; 2 ) sure-footed maneuvering by Speaker Sam Rayburn ; 3 ) sober second thoughts by Republican House leaders . The nonpartisan character of the vote prompted a happy comment from President Truman : Congress would really be ready for the peace treaty .
