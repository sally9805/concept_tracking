No winter gale ever tied up Nova Scotia 's deep-sea fishing fleet so completely as the strike that held it in port last week when the fishing weather was fine . While the fleet 's 30 schooners , trawlers and draggers lay at the docks , the walkout had spread from deep-sea crewmen ( 500 strong ) to hundreds of sympathizing inshore fishermen . Soon it would force the closing of processing plants and fish-box factories , thus shut down the province 's entire fishing industry . <P> The strike had started over money . Fish prices had skyrocketed and so had profits . Some boat owners , by union reckoning , were making as much as $300 on a shareholding of $500 . But deep-sea crewmen , who got only about $1,000,000 ( some $2,000 apiece ) of a 1946 gross running between $5,000,000 and $6,000,000 , wanted a fatter slice . <P> Something for Fishermen . To get it , most of them had joined the fingerling Fishermen 's and Fish Handlers ' Union . Three months ago the union demanded that the " lay " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e. net after deductions for various operating costs ) be changed from the traditional 50-50 lay to 60% for crewmen , 40 for owners . Also demanded : a redivision of operating costs . <P> Lunenburg Sea Products , Ltd. , the biggest fleet owner , readily agreed to the idea of the 60-40 lay , which would boost a crewman 's average earnings by roughly $400 a year . But Lunenburg balked at paying certain small operating expenses ( e.g. the maintenance of a medicine chest on each boat ) , and insisted that these come out of gross earnings before the lay . <P> Nothing for Reds . Actually , Lunenburg and the other owners were not much concerned with the relatively piddling sum involved . What concerned them was that a union run by a Red seemed to be getting too solid a footing in the industry . They had good reason to fear . <P> The boss of the Fishermen 's Union , big , flabby , 265-lb . Harry C. Meade , is a Communist . A Canadian , " Bert " Meade ran away to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1937 as an organizer for the Red-hued National Maritime Union . He went back to Canada in 1944 , soon became Atlantic vice president of the Canadian Seamen 's Union . He also became executive board member in Nova Scotia of the Labor Progressive Party , Canada 's Communist Party , of which his wife is provincial secretary . In due time , Bert Meade turned to organizing the fishermen , did a bang-up job . <P> Last week , apparently full of confidence in the discipline of his membership , Meade was in no mood to compromise on the minor points in dispute . Cried he : " We will fight to the bitter end . "
