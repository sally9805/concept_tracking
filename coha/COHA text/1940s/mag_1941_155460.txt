Five months ago President Roosevelt gave young ( 32 ) Nelson Rockefeller a bigger job than any he was heir to . His title : Coordinator of Commercial and Cultural Relations between the American Republics . His job : to give the U. S. a better name than it had , south of the Rio Grande . That meant economic aid ( to check Nazi penetration ) and the active publicizing of the U. S. case ( to supplant Nazi propaganda on the virtues of dictatorship ) . <P> The U. S. had many a Government department and private agency working for better Pan-American relations , but none that was notably energetic , imaginative , outspoken . As time went by and little was heard from Coordinator Rockefeller , it looked as if his attempt might have gone the way of all others . Critics complained that Mr. Rockefeller had apparently done nothing except suggest to movie producers that they refrain from showing gigolos as Argentines . But last week Coordinator Rockefeller issued a preliminary report that showed he had done a good deal more . Based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged : <P> &gt; That U. S. business in South America has often ignorantly hired anti-American commercial agents . <P> &gt; That these agents use U. S. advertising appropriations to force newspapers and radios to follow anti-American policies . <P> &gt; That many such Latin-American employes of U. S. firms are known members of anti-American organizations . <P> &gt; That some of them turn over confidential trade information to other and unfriendly countries , help German merchants by supplying U. S. goods to fill orders on which the Nazis would otherwise have to default . Furthermore , said Mr. Rockefeller , many firms representing U. S. companies distribute anti-American propaganda , and , in a number of cases , their officers and employes are officials of anti-American powers . <P> Coordinator Rockefeller said " anti-American " rather than " Nazi . " He also reported that many companies are cleaning house . He added that most U. S. companies knew nothing of the political wire-pulling their agents were engaged in.
