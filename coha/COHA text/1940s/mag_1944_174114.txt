Although they were more concerned about the forthcoming home-and-home , do-or-die series with Washington , the New York Giants took time out last week to spill the high-riding Packers , 24-to-0 . From mediocre material , stout ( 270 Ib . ) Steve Owen , the Giants coach , has produced a first-rate defensive club-which leads the league in pass interceptions with 26 . For the Green Bay game , he gave Halfback-Rookie Howie Livingston the unenviable job of minding Don Hutson , the alltime greatest pass receiver . The rookie did a job on Hutson , intercepted two passes , allowed Hutson to snare only four , all for small gains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvaged some satisfaction from Sunday 's scores-the Chicago Bears bowed to Detroit , 41-1-0-21 , giving the Packers their first western title in four years .
