A new protection against flash burns , often suffered by soldiers &; sailors caught by the heat waves caused by explosions , was announced this week by the Navy Medical Research Institute at Bethesda , Md . The Institute researchers tried 70 creams before they developed one that filled the bill . The new cream is grey ( which helps camouflage ) , lasts six to eight hours , will not rub off except with soap , does not interfere with finger action , protects against a heat flash of over 1,800 F. The formula is secret . <P> Sailors from Pearl Harbor and soldiers from Africa have spent long weeks in hospitals suffering from flash burns covering big areas of skin . A sailor stripped to the waist burns much worse than one wearing a skivvy shirt . So the Navy now tries to make men keep their shirts on in battle . The new cream covers the places clothing cannot-hands and face . <P> As yet the cream has not been tested in battle . But there have been many tests on volunteers at the Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brunets and redheads differ in susceptibility to burns . They suggest that fighting men be encouraged to get suntanned as a burn protection . The new cream has also been demonstrated at the Army 's Armored Command Research Medical Laboratory with a view to its use by tank crews , who , like sailors , are liable to powder and fuel flash burns .
