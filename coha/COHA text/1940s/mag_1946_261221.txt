The dead dictator 's luxurious train rolled from Berlin across the old , beaten land . In Hitler 's bed slept James F. Byrnes , of Charleston , S.C . His advisor , Benjamin V. Cohen of Muncie , Ind. , slept in Gring 's bed , restlessly . The train rolled into Stuttgart 's bomb-wrecked station and Byrnes got off to ride behind an escort of screeching U.S. Army jeeps to the Staatstheater . There , watched by U.S. generals and diplomats , German functionaries and civilians , Russian and other newspapermen , Byrnes delivered the speech which Europe and Asia recognized as America 's boldest move yet towards leadership of the world . <P> Tired looking and jaunty as ever , he read in a slow , clear voice which even Germans with an imperfect command of his tongue could understand . Despite the language of diplomacy , Russians would also understand . <P> The U.S. had moved from the Paris Peace Conference , its stale yammering , its endless skirmishes around the periphery of political war , into Germany . Byrnes 's journey to Stuttgart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end , would be the great strategic battlefield . There the U.S. now stood , inviting Germans to stand on Western democracy 's side . <P> No Withdrawal . Byrnes offered Germans a chance to reform a nation , an opportunity denied them- " for the time being " - by the Potsdam agreement of 1945 . But now the time had come : Germans should be given " under proper safeguards . . . primary responsibility for the running of their own affairs . " <P> He outlined the technique of forming a democratic state . First step : a provisional government should draft a federal constitution under the eyes of the Allied Control Council . He promised again : German industry would be restored . ( Buried forever was the Morgenthau plan to reduce Germany to pastoral impotency . ) War industries would be removed and eliminated , but Germany would be allowed to maintain " average European living standards . " <P> Along with these proposed changes in the German economy went specific proposals for territorial changes . Knigsberg and adjacent areas must go to Russia , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , would not necessarily go to the Soviet-dominated government of the Poles , although now administered by Poland . The Saar would go to France . The Ruhr and the Rhineland , however , would remain German . <P> And until these terms were carried out-essentially the terms laid down at Potsdam-until the U.S. was satisfied that Germany had become a responsible democracy , the U.S. would remain , with its military power . <P> That was the nub of Jimmy Byrnes 's speech , and he said it so that no one could misunderstand : " We intend to continue our interest in the affairs of Europe and of the world . ... I want no misunderstanding . We will not shirk our duty . We are not withdrawing . As long as an occupation force is required in Germany the Army of the United States will be a part of that occupation force . " <P> He sat down amidst mild applause .
