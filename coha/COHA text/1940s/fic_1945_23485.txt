are ex 's  --  ex-sailors , ex-longshoremen , ex-bartenders , ex-writers , ex-artists or maybe just ex-drunks . Believe it or not , I used to be a writer . But time passed on and I got so I could n't write any more ; and there I was , going on ninety-two or words to that effect , and wondering betimes how one goes about it to start a new career in his second childhood . I still had my typewriter , but you ought to see what came out of it ; that I was also a physical wreck did not add greatly to my disabilities . I do n't mean that I was discouraged . I was as full of hope and futility as an aging pitcher with a broken ann . What galled me most was the war and the fact that I , who had customarily thought of myself as a part of human society , was n't doing a damn thing . I tried this and that . I tried being pickled in alcohol for a couple of years , but nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the raids did n't pan out either . I thought of buying bonds , but one 's patriotism sometimes gets mixed up with one 's alcoholism and I bought bonded liquor instead . I know that was cockeyed , but it was n't irrational , for I figured that my adored government would get the money either way but , under my option , it would n't have to pay any of it back . The only fly in the ointment was that my money , for some reason or other , gave out ; so the next thing I knew I was a barge captain . I did n't exactly apply for the job . I just explained the situation to the Army officer in charge and left it up to him to say whether I could qualify . Never having worked on a boat , I could not assume to advise him as to that . He squirmed a bit , but it was a seller 's market as far as employment was concerned , so he gave me some civil service blanks to fill out along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " BC 1302 . " Theoretically , I was supposed to be instructed in my new duties by the incumbent captain for two whole days . But it took me two days to find the boat and , when I found it , the captain was leaving it to take up his new responsibilities . Also he could n't speak any English and I wasequally unversed in any Filipino dialect . So I assumed command of BC 1302 in a spirit of complete open-mindedness . My civil service examination was tedious but not difficult since none of the hundreds of questions asked had any reference whatever to working on a boat . The job , I learned , was still " ungraded " and the examination a sort of catch-all questionnaire which made up in bulk whatever it lacked in relevance . Aspirants for the position , for instance , had to list their college degrees , both in academic and technical institutions , although it was not essential that they know how to read and write ; and they must state what books they had written ( Do not enclose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full account of how and where they had spent their days from childhood on . After the applicant had furnished these data , he was directed from desk to dcsk at Brooklyn Army Base , where he was asked the same questions over and over again . I think I passed that examination , although I never heard from it directly . I had never traveled in Russia or committed any other felony and Martin Dies had seemingly never heard of me ; so I felt confident . And the list of books I had authored , while it might not seem impressive in another setting , was a bit too long to squeeze into the space provided , so I figured that it must have been up to the average barge-captain 's output . 19 UT I had other hurdles to jump , or other lines , rather , in which to be jumped on , hour after hour . Proving my citizenship , for instance , was a complicated and long-drawn-out process which not only caused me some sleepless nights but taxed the time and energy of many government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain to be a citizen ; but I had claimed citizenship on the mere grounds that I was born in this country and my father was a citizen , and it was therefore up to me to prove it . But Father , alas , had long since died , and I did n't know a living soul who was present at my birth in Ogdensburg , N. Y. , January 31 , 1880 . If I had been naturalized only the week before , there would have been no difficulty . Or if only I had been born in recent decades when vital statistics have been generally recorded . But the old family Bible , I learned , would n't do at all , nor would affidavits of responsible citizens that they had known me as an American citizen for thirty or forty years . I could n't go on being a barge captain , I learned , unless I could get a Coast Guard identification card , and I could n't get that on any such flimsy testimony . The late Robert Lansing , one time Secretary of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued a passport to " Charles W. Wood , an American citizen , " to travel in China and Japan in 1919 and 1920 ; and when I accidentally discovered that passport I had the evidence in black and white . Even the Coast Guard would not dispute the word of a Secretary of State , and Mr. Lansing knew I was a citi- zen because two responsible citizens had signed an affidavit to that effect . My physical examination was also rig-orous and also consisted of standing in line . My sight and hearing were faulty , my heart was had , and my insides needed re-lining ; but aside from that , and the fact that I needed a major operation , which I underwent some months later , I came through with flying colors . For when the Army needs barge captains , it gets them . I gathered that we were not supposed to live through the winter anyway ; or that if we did n't it would be for some cause for which the Army could not be held responsible . There was also an oral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't do so well . My examiner was a strictly practical woman bureaucrat , and she wanted to know exactly what experi-ence I had had in " operating a barge . " I confessed that I had had none whatever . I went even further and said I did n't know that barges were operated by their cap- tains. 1 could n't be sure , for I hadn'tseen much of my barge yet , but it was my impression that barges were just shoved around , and I tried to tell her that I had had many years ' experience in being shoved around . But my examiner was adamant . She said that while I might possibly qualify for some office job ( I would rather go to jail for life than to take any kind of office job ) she positively would not sanction my becoming a barge captain when I was so obviously disqualified . All that sustained me in this ordeal was the fact that I was a barge captain and was getting time-and- a-half for the overtime in which I was listening to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of BC 1302 , I have almost ceased to worry . But I ca n't be sure . There is likely to he some lag at best between an official decision and its execution ; and it would n't surprise me very much if ; in another year or two , I should find myself disqualified for lack of experience . For the present , however , I am certainly a harbor hand unless , as I sometimes suspect , it may all turn out to be a dream , from which I may wake with an awful feeling that I must return my pay-checks ( $1,740 a year , with time-and-a-half for overtime ) to the United States Treasury and retract everything that I have said so far . But I do n't believe it is a dream it 's too unreal . I am convinced that I am a barge captain , not a writer or a rum-hound or anything that I have ever been before . Of course I still have much to learn . But I am improving year by year . Sometimes , even now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to land . Sometimes I tie a Nowlin ' in a hurry and it comes out all right . Perhaps , in another twenty or thirty years  --  well , I hope I do n't have to go back to the old typewriter . Mr. Martin mites from personal observation of an Army orientation course somewhere in the United Stales . " TODAY WE TAKE UP YOUR ALLY , RUSSIA " JOHN BARTLOW MARTIN S OME of the forty or fifty new soldiers in the room had been drafted from the South  --  from farms in the hills or from the Louisiana swamps . Some were Midwesterners from farm communities and from city slums . Less than half had gone to high school , and only a handful had attended college . These men were gathered for a discussion period as a part of the Army 's orientation program . They had had about eleven weeks of it . By now all of them had a general idea of the roles England and Russia have played in the war , but few had formed any opinions about the parts they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distrusted both allies , particularly England . Toward the Germans they seemed to have little or no antagonism , but some of the younger ones professed hatred of the Japanese  --  an attitude which they seemed to feel was appropriate now that they were in uniform ( and which occasionally fitted comfortably with their race and color prejudices ) . On this particular Saturday morning they had as usual filed into the little , bare camp theater five minutes Iate for the scheduled ten o'clock session . On the stage was a blackboard on which was lettered : USSR 1 . SIZE 3 . PEOPLE 2 . COUNTRY 4 . GOVT Behind this was a large map of Russia . The second lieutenant who served as battalion orientation officer ( after the " Good morning , men , " the bored " Good morning , sir , " and the smiling repetition , " You can do better than that  --  good morning , men , " which the trainees had come to endure ) kidded the men about their food , joked about the on-stage hammering of two carpenters who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a bird which flew out from behind the blackboard and over the men 's heads , and then , at 10:10 , launched into a summary of the week 's news , which included the attacks on Iwo Jima , Manila , and the Siegfried Line . ( Classes in other subjects rarely began this way . ) The lieutenant suggested the unwelcome possibility of a negotiated peace with Japan : " If this happens your sons will be fighting the next war . " Then , at 10:14 , he said , " Today we are going to take up your ally , Russia . For years Russia has been a secret . We do n't know much about her . But she 'll be important after the war . And you men 'll be the men who 'll have to decide about Russia  --  us bald-headed guys 'll be done for . " He paused a moment . This instructor had replaced the younger lieutenant as Battalion I and E officer midway in the cycle . A little older than most of the other second lieutenants , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wholesome **25;748;TOOLONG way of speaking directly to the men that was somehow reminiscent of a Scoutmaster 's manner , or that of a Y.M.C.A. secretary . He gave some statistics on Russia 's size , resources , and products . " Now , government . They have a fount of government that we  --  that the world  --  has never been too sure whether it was right or wrong . This is due to Russian secrecy . For years they 've convoyed tourists around , just letting ' em see what they wanted ' em to see . Their government started in 1917 with the Bolshevik revolution . The Bolsheviks were a small party but through violent action they managed to overthrow the Czar and set up communism . Actually they 've never really had communism . First they had bolshevism and then they had socialism and now they 're swinging over more to our type of government . They had no private property people worked where they were told to . But Russia wanted to he strong . So they had to become democratic . They put in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you work the more you get paid . They recognized the church . " But though Russia is a democracy actually it 's a one party dictatorship . They have eleven republics and normally you 'd expect to have several parties working , just like we have here . But there in Russia , by law there 's only one party permitted . " The men sat packed closely together on long straight-backed wooden benches ; they smelled wet . Outside it was cold and rainy ; the day was gray . The building was unheated but the combined heat of the men 's bodies warmed them , and they were glad to have this hour during which they could sit down and , better still , get out of the rain . Some of them slept ; from time to time the cadremen walked up the aisles and wakened the trainees by tapping them on the head with sticks . The lieutenant continued : " When Russia attacked Finland we were down on her . We felt that Finland was democratic and after all they were the only nation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pretty bitter . Feeling was pretty bitter , " and he shook his head , a habit he had . " But now it turns out the story was this : Marshal Mannerheim was strictly pro-Nazi . The Russians were afraid Finland would permit Germany to establish bases from which to attack them . All right . They did n't come out and tell the world that . What did they do ? When the two sworn enemies of the world  --  fascism and communism  --  all of a sudden signed a non-aggression pact things looked pretty dark for the democracies of the world . We thought we were gon na fight Russia and Germany both , as well as Italy and Japan and all the rest . As it happened , Russia was n't prepared for war . That was a case of using international politics to forestall war till they were ready . You recall that during the Czech crisis of ' 38 and ' 39 all the world powers except Russia were invited to the conference . Russia had been friendly with the democracies till then . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they became very secretive . One doubt led to another . It took the German attack on Russia to let everybody know where Russia stood . " He discussed Russia 's role in the war , then said , " In the future Russia is going to have a lot to say in the postwar world . They 've killed a lot of Germans and they 've suffered tremendous losses . They 're going to demand a voice . " Now . How is all this going to affect us ? " He paused but nobody said anything . He did not seem to expect an answer . " Basically , Russia is agricultural , " he said . " They 've been trying to industrialize and be self-sufficient . So they 'll need lots of machinery after the war . The U. S. Bureau of Commerce thinks Russia will be a big customer . What can she give us in return ? We 've got all the gold . Well , she has unlimited oil , all the alloys you need in our big steel plants . How about agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets ? We 've got to export . So does she . A big market will be Europe . With her controlled labor she probably can sell cheaper than we can . Does this mean trouble ? Could be , " he said , shaking his head . " Could be . " Nothing on the faces of his hearers indicated deep concern . He went on , " Just where dues Russia fit in after the war ? That 's gon na mean a lot to you . You men , in selecting representatives for your government , will have to think about that . When you see anything in the papers about Russia , read it . Think about it . " AF TER another minute or two he sent two platoons out for discussion with non-coms . He kept the third and fourth platoons in the theater . The company commander looked at his watch and spoke to the lieutenant . By the time the first and second had left it was 10:35 . The lieutenant came down off the stage and put one foot up on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you men got about all this ? " One of the trainees who frequently spoke up to no particular purpose said he had thought that Russia 's population was 192 million instead of 170 million , as the instructor had said . Frowning a bit , the lieutenant looked at his notes and said , in a voice that sounded a trifle constrained , " The last census was in 1933 and it was 170 then . She do n't always want the rest of the world to know too much about what 's going on . " This had consumed a couple of minutes . The lieutenant consumed a couple more trying , without success , to get the men to talk . He said , " How many here are from farms ? " A good many of the trainees obediently held up their hands . " You 're going to be affected , " the lieutenant said . " How many worked in steel mills ? " Perhaps a half dozen hands went up . " You 're going to be affected too . All right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Russia after the war ? " One trainee said , " Our farmers have lots of new equipment and as far as we know Russia do n't . So for some time at least I do n't think they can compete with us . " The lieutenant nodded . " That 's true . " But a young trainee who wore glasses and had been to college said , " I 'd like to dispute with him on that . Russia has the biggest collective farms in the world . " He elaborated on this . No one argued with him , though the lieutenant encouraged discussion . Another man said , " The Balkans are in bad shape now because of the war . They 're gon na need a lot of food . " " That 's true , " the lieutenant said . There was another silence . Then a man said , " Sir , is n't it true that our country , being a capitalist country , has to trade with Russia , but that Russia can keep her own products if she wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not necessarily . All countries must trade . They have to get rid of their excess products or else they 'll have unemployment . Russia 's the same way . She 'll have to export and so she 'll have to cultivate oilier nations to get markets . All nations must have dealings with each other the same as neighbors in a block . " No one was inclined to discuss this . A trainee said , " Sir , do you recall when Germany ? " he meant Russia " signed the non-aggression pact with Germany , it was n't only Finland she fought but other countries too ; and after she beats Germany wo n't it break out all over again ? " The lieutenant said , " He believes we 're not through with Russia yet . I agree . I think it 's a long ways from settled . " The men accepted this without change of expression . That is one thing you notice about soldiers on duty  --  their expressionless faces . One trainee said , " Sir , is n't there a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was . The man who had suggested future trouble with Russia said , " Are n't the Balkans disgusted with both Germany and Russia ? ' ' The lieutenant said , " He asked if the Balkans were n't disgusted with Germany and Russia both . I think they are . We all feel we 'd rather have our own form of government than any that 's forced on us . But people will take another one if they think it 's less bad than some other they might have to take . Maybe the Russians are n't satisfied themselves ; but they grabbed hold of communism because it was their own , at least their own people set it up . Maybe things are n't as settled over there as we think . Maybe that 's why Russia do n't want visitors . Maybe now they see our government they 'll see that their form of government 's less perfect than they 've been trying to tell the world it was . " A trainee asked , a bit challengingly , " Did n't Mr. Roosevelt say that Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lieutenant laughed a bit and said , " I do n't know . " In all the orientation periods there was a noticeable effort to fight shy of domestic politics . A young man who had spent a year in college before the Army grabbed him said , " Russia says if you do n't work you do n't eat . That was written by Carl Sandburg once . Russia has that . " No one replied directly . The lieutenant raised another question : " Do you think that Russia will ever fight the United States ? " One Southern youth said , " The British are hoggish ? " his term evoked laughter " ? and Russia wo n't stand for that . We 're the only ones can stop it . We 're the only ones can control the whole thing . " Another said , " We 've always been allies with England . " Another : " The other day in the paper it said Russia and England were squabbling over Greece . " ( That question was hot at the time . ) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of influence " which Russia wants , which is logical . " He asked , " Would you like to see them go back to the prewar boundaries ? Or should the Allies divide up the countries they conquer ? " One man said , " England 's a little country and she do n't have economic control over her holdings . But she has a lot of raw materials in her empire . I do n't think England should have a sphere of influence in the Balkans . " Another : " Russia is simply trying to get back her old lands , " and he spoke for several moments on Russia 's historic boundaries . No one challenged him but no one seemed particularly impressed either . Another man said , " Most people object to Russia having a sphere of influence because of Russia 's economic system . People forget that every country goes through the communist stage . Just like we did , once . " The lieutenant , who seemed to have been waiting for something like this , asked eagerly , " There  --  do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change over to capitalism ? " The men , seeming to sense his own unspoken feeling , murmured affirmatively . The lieutenant discussed the five-year-plan briefly . Then a man from Detroit said , " Sir , they claim Russia will be number one after the war and we 'll be second and England third . We 've always been number one . " The lieutenant said , " Men , there 's something to think about . " He looked at his watch . It was 10:45 . " It 's all yours , Sergeant , " he called . The platoon sergeants , who had been sitting expressionless with the other cadremcn at the back of the room rose , and there was a noisy scrape of feet and rustling of raincoats as the trainees reached under the benches for their helmet liners . " At ease ! " the lieutenant snapped . The men froze . " You have n't been dismissed yet . " He looked over them , swinging his head slowly from one side to the other . " I want you to give these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right . Platoon sergeants take over . " The platoon sergeants called , " Fall in on your stacks , " and the trainees got up and filed out to their rifles , which stood in straight rows of conical stacks in the rain . The next hour was bayonet practice . Do Doves Have Talons ? FOR several months now , like everyone else in the business , we 've been reading and talking about the United Nations Conference . One of us went out to San Francisco to see the eggs of the new diplomacy laid ( see " San Francisco Retrospect " in last month 's issue ) , but he was back here in New York before they hatched . Now that the U. S. Senate and the men whom Mr. Truman refreshingly refers to as " the so-called Big Three " are incubating the unfledged doves of peace , almost everyone in the office has sounded off orally , or in the form of an interoffice memorandum , on the subject of his or her ideas about what 's likely to happen . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fighting cocks . Others are quite willing to accept them as doves , and turtledoves at that . But of the assorted notions which the staff got down on paper , John Fischer 's ( p. 97 ) seemed to all of us to offer the most useful basis for an article . Not that Mr. Fischer has discovered any new or chromium-plated truths ; for , as he never tires of insisting , you can find one or another element of his argument in such diverse places as the geopolitics of Haushofer and MacKinder , in the recent books of Waiter Lippmann , and in the writings of William T. R. Fox and Nicholas J. Spykman . But it seems to us that Mr. Fischer succeeds admirably in indicating just what perches are available for the San Francisco birds to sit on  --  be they doves or cocks . Mr. Fischer 's insistence on the nonoriginality of his ideas reminded us vaguely of a book we had once read , for reasons no longer clear to us , which was written during the Civil War by a preacher in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , variously a lawyer , a politician , a railroad president , a Presbyterian and Congregational minister , an author , and a chaplain of Congress . The other day we dug up a copy of his book , English and French Neutrality and the Anglo-French Alliance in their Relations to the United States and Russia , published in Cincinnati in 1864 . It 's quite a book , in spite of some passages which seem pretty silly in retrospect . It 's one the teachers of history would do well to enliven themselves with . Basically , Boynton 's idea was that England and France were toppling from their perches as the world 's great powers . England 's support of the Confederacy and Louis Napoleon 's installation of Maximilian in Mexico during the early years of the Civil War were he argued , desperate and futile efforts to sap the growing power of the Western colossus . Similarly , he argued , the Crimean War was an attempt to thwart the legitimate expansion of Czarist Russia . " The popular opinion concerning Russia , " he noted , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  her government is a horrible despotism , and she is the determined foe of liberty , the chief barrier to European progress . " The ferocious Russian bear , the Western European powers cried , was about to seize and devour the Turkish lamb ; but , said Boynton ( anticipating Mr. Fischer 's argument ) , if the English lion " wars against the bear merely because he desires the prey himself , it is not needful , on this account , that American sympathies should he strongly ex-cited . " The fifty million Russians , Boynton asserted , were universally convinced " that Russia is entrusted with a great mission in the Social regeneration of the world , " and on that belief rested Russia 's national policy . This policy Boynton wrote , eighty years ago will , perhaps , be best understood by presenting , as preliminary , some negative statements . And first of these , it may be truly affirmed that the conquest of Western Europe is no part of the policy of Rus-           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
