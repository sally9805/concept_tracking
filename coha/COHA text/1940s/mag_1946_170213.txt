Out of Canada last week came news of a startling scientific discovery : a treatment for heart disease ( the nation 's No. i killer ) which so far has succeeded against all common forms of the ailment . <P> Like so many research triumphs , this one had been almost an accident . Thirteen years ago a London , Ont. obstetrician named Evan Vere Shute became interested in vitamin E , whose natural sources are in whole grain ; he had a hunch that it produced a salutary effect on heart and blood vessels . When a fellow member of his church-his only male patient-complained of tremendous heart pains , Shute put him experimentally on cold , pressed wheat-germ oil . For three months he got relief . When both patient and doctor ran out of funds , the treatment was abandoned . <P> But Evan Shute did not forget it . Last summer , when a colleague asked him to suggest a research project for a bright young medical student , Floyd Skelton , Shute suggested tests for the effectiveness of vitamin E against hemorrhage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his class-free Saturday afternoons , with a modest grant of $150 and laboratory privileges from his alma mater . He soon discovered that dogs given stiff jolts of vitamin E would not have hemorrhages . <P> Impressed , Dr. Shute decided to try the experiment on humans , using Skelton 's principle of large , concentrated doses of the vitamin . A friend , Dr. Arthur Berge Francis Vogelsang , had just the man : a 68-year-old pensioner who was dying of hypertensive heart disease and hemorrhages , was due to have his spleen removed the next day . The attending surgeon was willing to try the vitamin , since he was afraid the patient would die on the operating table . Within a week after treatment the old man was out of bed , bustling around the hospital ward and helping nurses with the dinner trays . Dr. Shute 's barber , Roy Bicknell , was in agony from coronary heart disease ; three weeks after taking the vitamin , he was able to play the drums in a Little Theater orchestra , go fishing , and return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 100 patients brought quick and often dramatic relief . <P> Muscle Repair . Last week , in two papers read in St. Thomas , Ont. before the St. Thomas and East Elgin Medical Society , Dr. Vogelsang made the first public announcement of the new treatment . With his coauthors , Drs . Evan and Wilfred Shute , he gave full credit to Floyd Skelton for " crowning the research with final success . " <P> Large , concentrated doses of vitamin E , said Dr. Vogelsang , benefited four types of heart ailment ( 95% of the total ) : arteriosclerotic , hypertensive , rheumatic , old &; new coronary heart disease . The vitamin helps a failing heart . It eliminates anginal pain . It is nontoxic . But , he warned , it must be taken continuously , like digitalis and insulin , and must not be taken simultaneously with other drugs .
