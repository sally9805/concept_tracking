txt LEHMAN DEPLORES STATE TAX CURBS Asserts Attempts at ' Economic Isolation ' Are a Threat to Democratic Way of Life Charging that several States have deliberately attempted a policy of " economic isolation " in recent years , Governor Lehman warned last night that their efforts to " stifle the flow of trade across State lines " might eventually threaten our democratic way of life . Governor Lehman , Governor A. Harry Moore of New Jersey and Governor Raymond E. Baldwin of Connecticut spoke at the annual dinner of the National Tax Association , which is holding its thirtythird annual conference at the Hotel Pennsylvania . Their addresses followed a day of discussion of current tax problems by many governmental and university specialists in the field . Governor Moore pointed out that at present three-quarters of the cost of government in New Jersey is defrayed by taxes on real property , and he contended that this is too narrow a tax base . In working out replacement taxes , however , he said , care must be taken not to impose taxes that would harm the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor Baldwin , pointing out that Connecticut has a balanced budget without a sales tax or a State income tax , said that in his State an indicated deficit of $1,500 , - 000 when he took office in January , 1939 , has been changed to a surplus of $1,000,000 by a policy of government " friendly " to business , labor and agriculture , with resultant increased production . Sees Struggle by States for Gain In his assault on State tax policies that are creating interstate trade barriers , Governor Lehman said that over a period of years there has arisen " a shameless struggle for gain at the expense of sister States . " He said that these policies were of " questionable material benefit " to the States that employ them . " Laws have employed the power of government not for purposes of revenue but rather to stifle the flow of trade across State lines in behalf of domestic interests and enterprises , " Governor Lehman said . " The net result has been to limit open competition , raise prices , lower standards of quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Turning to the " political and social implications " of this trend , Governor Lehman said that " while our democratic way of life is being challenged more fiercely than at any recent stage of our national history , we quibble among ourselves over questionable material benefit . " " If the time ever arrives when boundary lines of the forty-eight States assume ' Treater significance than as mere geographic borders , our democracy is doomed , " Governor Lehman continued . " National strength and solidarity in times of crisis are strongly dependent upon singleness of purpose , absolute // win called for " a complete reversal of the government 's economic poll , cies of the past several years  --  a proSTATE TAX CURBS LEHMAN DEPLORES // unity , friendly understanding and helpful cooperation between the States . None of these essentials is promoted by a philosophy which gives to State interests a priority over those of the nation . " Governor Lehman recommended the formation of a ommittee of members of the National Tax Association to endeavor to " substitute order for chaos " in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Federal Government has virtually pre-empted so many tax fields that we now have a helpless morass of overlapping revenue laws , " he declared , adding that duplication of taxation is common and sometimes results in discouraging initiative and enterprise . Decries Emergency Borrowing Governor Moore said that it would be necessary for the States to abandon ultimately " our emergency borrowing and piecemeal tapping of State funds . " He warned that welfare and relief activities on a larger scale than were dreamed of before 1930 must now be accepted on " a more or less permanent basis , " and that New Jersey , at least , would have to accept " troublesome " changes in its railroad taxes . " We must pay , in the total , more taxes than heretofore because we can not continue deficit spending and deficit financing in the community or the State or the nation , " he warned . " But we must create our national defenses , maintain them after they are created , and pay as we go both the current costs of local and State government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety lies in our industry , our sturdy citizenship and our financial strength . " Asserting that the only way in which the national defense needs can be met without sacrificing our standard of living is through increamed production , Governor Baldgram of plenty instead of the present program of scarcity . " Governor Baldwin said that the taxation problem currently has been greatly complicated by the need for national defense , but that this made more evident than ever the need for " a sound tax economy and a sound national economy . " " Unless , now , we produce more , either the defense program will ha'e to be curtailed or the standard of living lowered , " he went on . " We do not want either of these things to happen . The only answer is increased production . Our program must be a complete reversal of government 's economic policies of the past several years  --  a program of plenty instead of the present program of scarcity . " Our problem is the broad one of seeking the highest possible productivity of men and machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not by sacrificing , our present standards of living , and only through productive effort in all fields ( not alone in the field of national defense ) can we sufficiently broaden the base of national income to distribute the cost-burden of national defense equitably . " A warning that the United States stands possibly at the threshold of war in a financial condition weaker than at the beginning of any of her previous wars was sounded at the morning session yesterday by Professor Fred R. Fairchild of Yale University , who said that this was the result of " seven years of unsound conduct of the national finances . " " The American tax system today is stretched close to the limit of its elasticity , " Professor Fairchild continued . " It offers little opportunity for increased revenue to meet the needs of national defense or war . " Present-day tax rates have been pushed so high that they are laying a " deadening hand " on investment and business , he declared . He said that much of the recent Federal tax legislation has been enacted " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been incorporated into the tax laws by persons primarily interested in punishing " big business . " Charles W. Gerstenberg , president of the association , said that the tax laws have reached such " astronomical proportions " that the general tax expert has disappeared and in his place there have arisen technical specialists in limited fields and tax economists . State tax statutes , he said , contain about 12,000,000 words and the Federal Internal Revenue Code alone has more than 400,000 words . He estimated that Federal court de-1 cisions affecting tax laws amounted to more than 40,000,000 words and would take five years to read.1 Many tax experts find that it is all they can do to keep up with a single phase of the Federal tax laws , such as the income tax law , he said . Sees Need for Flexibility Gerhard Colm , who was a financial adviser to the German Government from 1922 through 1926 , and is now associated with the New School of Social Research , defended the use of government fiscal policy to direct the flow of purcnasing power and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious the need for greater flexibility in methods of financing it . Professor James W. Martin of the Bureau of Research of the University of Kentucky and Professor Paul H. Nystrom of Columbia University debated anti-chain-store taxation at the afternoon session , with Professor Martin approving It with some reservations and Professor Nystrom condemning it . Dr. Martin said that he approved of " differential taxation of chains , " but ' only in so far as it was " reasonably fair as between various classes of merchants . " He said that the case for differential taxation of chains rests on three bases : their relatively greater prosperity , the relatively lower taxes they pay as compared with unit stores and the social and cultural losses to the community for which they are responsible . Professor Nystrom retorted that if chain-store taxation continues to spread , " the consuming public will pay and pay plenty . " He said that chain-store legislation was essentially an attempt by wholesalers and independents to have the public treasury pay for enforcing legislation to put the chains out of business . Regulatory taxes would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a war economy , Professor William J. Schultz of the College of the City of New York declared . He said that since every detail of a tax inescapably exercises a regulatory effect on an economic system , these effects should be deliberately utilized to achieve the ends desired .
