The Mysterious Mr. Gibbs 4 By ALFA JOHNSTON Almost unknown before the war , a naval architect who sculptures his ships first in plastics has been a keyrnan in the construction of the world 's greatest fighting fleet . ILLIAM FRANCIS GIBBS developed his ass-production methods of shipbuilding in co-operation with the Navy during the 30 's . His first chance to apply them on a large scale came in 1940 , when the British government sent over a mission to build the so-called British emergency fleet to replace cargo ships sunk by submarines . Before the fall of France and the rise of Churchill , the British handled these fife-and-death matters with curious leisureliness . The mission first looked over the Canadian situation , coming finally to the obvious conclusion that there were no idle shipyards there . Then they called at the offices of the Todd Shipyards Corporation in New York . Here they were informed that existing shipbuilding facilities were working at capacity , and that new shipyards would have to be built for the proposed emergency fleet . The mission then conscientiously plodded about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , they told the Todd organization to go ahead and build the ships . The Todd people decided to use Gibbs ' designs and his hurry-up procurement methods . One Todd official , with a touch of enthusiastic hyperbole , said , " We used Gibbs because his plans are so clearly worked out and his procurement of materials so perfect that the building of a ship is like putting together a set of child 's construction toys . " The head of the British mission was sent to Gibbs . The commissioner said , with the air of a man demanding the impossible , that his government wanted twenty ships . You do n't need them , " acid Gibbs . " What do you mean ? " asked the commissioner , " If England is within twenty ships of winning the war , " said Gibbs , " she has won the war already . " " How many would you suggest ? " " Sixty as a start . " This was regarded as a bit of Yankee extravagance , but the mission raised the order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to forty-five , then to sixty . Gibbs designed a standard British tramp steamer , adapting it for welding instead of riveting , and making other changes to suit American shipbuilding methods . He likes to design radical innovations and he made his reputation by introducing new ideas into shipbuilding . But he constantly preaches the maxim that the worst mistake a designer can make is " to try to improve on perfection . " He regarded the British tramp steamer of the " Northeast-Coast " type as perfection  --  the easiest and cheapest ship in its class to build and the most efficient to operate . It took iron will to resist the temptation to do something new , but he forced himself to stick to his maxim . Todd formed the Todd-Bath Corporation to build thirty of the tramp ships at Bath , Maine , and the Todd-California to build the other thirty at Richmond , California . William Newell , one of the great shipbuilders of the time , was placed in charge of the work at Bath . Todd took a chance on a new man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unveiling of the West Coast production genius , as far as important shipbuilding was concerned . Kaiser and Newell are great personal friends and amiable competitors . Newell had developed remarkable short cuts and fast-action methods at 13uth , and welcomed the newcomer there to study them . Later , he was a bit taken aback when the inexperienced fellow in the West was first under the wire with the new ships , and he cheerfully took off his but to Kaiser , Newell had some consolation in reports that Kaiser had " outexpedited " him in getting materials . Railroad shipping clerks made some astonishing mistakes in taking supplies which had been allotted to Bath and shipping them to Richmond . The Todd company once traced a huge shipment of material intended for Newell , and finally discovered it going over the Sierra Nevada Mountains en route to the Kaiser plant . In one case , it was reported that an entire train had turned up by mistake at Richmond instead of Bath . Meeting his friend Kaiser by accident in a dining car , Newell said , " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Kaiser . Newell told the tale of the shanghaied train . " I never heard of it , " said Kaiser . Whether there was any fancy expediting or not , the sensational production by Kaiser and his group was bused mainly on the imaginative handling of the problem  --  the advance training of great numbers of workmen and the application of the assembly-line idea borrowed from the automobile industry . The first British-emergency- ! feet ship was finished by Kaiser ten months and one day after Gibbs put pencil on the first design sheet . As the ships rolled down the ways , the British were planning to order more , but our Liberty-ship program made this unnecessary . Gibbs prepared the plans for the Liberty , which was also a slightly altered British tramp steamer , and did the procurement for the first 312 of them . At the same time , he was designing more combat ships for the Navy . Going to Washington for the WPB , he presided over the construction of the destroyer-escort fleet , which helped to put the submarine out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Victory fleet of cargo ships . Then he worked on landing ships , icebreakers , minesweepers , floating machine-shop ships , mother ships , or tenders , 6 transports , seagoing dry docks for small landing craft , gasoline tankers and baby flat-tops . All together , Gibbs has had a hand in 4500 ships , built or building for the war effort , Gibbs made his first step toward mass production ten years ago , when three shipyards built destroyers from his design . At that ( Continued on Page 81 ) // THE MPS HAD ALLIES ON LEYTE Second only to " immersion feet " were skin diseases of many kinds , which most troopers lumped together under the single name of " jungle rot . " These infections were nerve-racking , but not usually fatal . At the camp I saw several soldiers whose bodies were covered with little round sores half the size of a dime , rum which pus exuded  --  a form of ringworm . The medics were painting these sores with a solution invented by an Italian Fascist who once taught tropical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this same doctor who later enabled Mussolini 's army in Ethiopia to establish an amazing health record . Although treatment was usually effective , one of our officers was so badly infected with the ringworm fungus that he died aboard the hospital ship on his way to the United States . Dysentery and diarrhea also were common because of the highly concentrated foods and the fact that the troopers often could n't light fires to boil water to clean their mess kits . Casualties due to enemy fire were relatively light in this sector , but hard to handle because of the rigors of a litter haul . It required eleven to fourteen hours to take men down the steep trail to the nearest portable hospital . Six to nine men handled the litters  --  sometimes our soldiers , sometimes Filipinos . The troopers ' war at this moment in the Leyte hills was being waged by scattered patrols after the historic fashion of mounted cavalry , or the reconnaissance of James Fenimore Cooper 's Deerslayer . After MacArthur 's first drive from the beachhead cleared the Leyte Valley by slaughtering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bataan , General Yamashita , the Jap hero of Singapore , tried desperately to turn the tide by a counterdrive through the Ormoc Valley . Vice Admiral Kinkaid 's carrier planes and what land planes we could muster destroyed so many Jap transports that MacArthur 's headquarters announced 112,728 Japanese dead , of whom 30,000 were drowned on transports in the Leyte operations . Nevertheless , some uncounted thousands of Nips landed , including crack veterans of the Jap let Division from Manchuria . MacArthur , the master strategist , made an amphibious end run into Ormoc Harbor with one division , got a couple more divisions on both flanks of the Jap forces . and sent cavalry into the hills to stop any drive over them toward the Leyte Valley . He had the Japs neatly trapped in a pocket fourteen miles long and eleven miles wide . The hilly section of this pocket W218 so seldom traveled by man that the best of our maps were all askew until we got photographic maps from the air . The cavalrymen 's mission was to send small patrols through the hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divisional and corps artillery far in their rear . A fair sample of these patrols was the one Lt. Eugene Eidson , of Lincoln , Nebraska , made with five enlisted men , all American Indians , and four Filipino carriers . They ranged five days through " extremely rough and barely passable " terrain , keeping out of sight of the Jap patrols , but spotting small concentrations of trucks , artillery and Nip infantry in the valleys below them . They told our artillery where the targets were and watched our shells blow the foe to smithereens . On the fifth day , a forced march from dawn to darkness brought them back to our lines . The patrol party led by Lt. Burns T. Tilton , of Houston , Texas . once got inside the perimeter of the Jap artillery force of three battalions , sketched positions , sent the sketches back and escaped unobserved . They then watched our gunfire knock out two of three Jap batteries . Occasionally , our men met Jap patrols in skirmishes , but on this sector there was every evidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using artillery shells to save American lives . At nights from my tent I could look to the rear and see the whole sky alight with flashes of artillery fire . A few seconds after every flash , one heard either the sharp crack from guns just down the hill or the dull thud from the Long Toms far behind us . Then we heard " whoosh " of shells overhead . About our only amusement was counting between the flash and the gun reports . It was usually three seconds after the flash before the nearer guns spoke , and nine before the more distant ones could be heard . Only those who have spent many nights far from civilization in rainy , dreary camps like our " Los Angeles " can understand the deadly monotony which weighs on men 's spirits . It was a godsend when Pvt . E. S. Campau , former brush salesman of Seattle and a red-hot banjo player , would bat out syncopated rhythms . The tired troopers listened as he played I 'm Dreaming of a White Christmas and began talking of home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinathey could understand what they were bidding on . In cases of this kind , a Gibbs executive sent them on board ships in New York harbor , saying , " Just prowl around and , if you see anything you can make , ask the name of it . Then let us know , and we 'll send you the specifications . " Other small manufacturers , working from plans and specifications , turned out marine equipment whose use was wholly unknown to them . After producing ship parts fur months , one factory owner came to New York and visited Gibbs &; Cox , Inc . " I ca n't stand it , " he said . " I 've got to know what you do with that gadget I make . Somebody has to take me to a ship and let me see the thing work . " Visits of this kind became commonplace later on . Some contractors said they had been driven wild by questions about their products , and were determined to find out the answers , so that they would cease to appear dumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they would be gradually squeezed out by the big ones , but the town , Swanee River , and Old Black Joe , a little bit of America was transplanted momentarily to this distant wilderness . Was a godsend , too , when rare mail arrived . I watched Sgt. Ben C. Hicks get a Christmas package from Hattie Flicks , of Wichita Falls , Texas , and actually felt physically warmed by his smile and the sudden new light in his eyes . I wish that Hattie could have seen it . All wars are tough , and I have watched war too long in Europe and the Orient . The Japs here were n't as smart as Kesselring 's Germans , but they can dish out death just as quickly as anybody when they attack . The best weapon they used in Ormoc Valley was the knee mortar , but our mortarmen are better . The Japs also used spider holes for snipers  --  narrow , deep holes widened out at the bottom like a water carafe . Down in this hole , the sniper is safe from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can come up and usually get in the first shot at our troopers before they get him . The Jap artillery in this sector was weak and inaccurate . Altogether , the troopers I visited agreed that the rain , mud , mountains and the everlasting dreary monotony were far worse enemies than the Japs . Comparisons are unfair , because each battleground has its own particular " worst , " but it is safe to say that nowhere in the world has the American soldier found weather and terrain more cruelly allied against him than on Leyte . A General 's Request irAJ . GEN . INNIS P. SWIFT writes 1 ? ( 1 us : " In recent issues of The Saturday Evening Post ( October 7 and 14 ) you have carried the story of the Los Negros battle of the Second Squadron , Fifth Cavalry . I would like to call your attention to the spelling of the squadron commander 's name . It is Lt. Col. William E. Lobit . ( The Past spelled it Lobat . ) It is only fair that the corrected spelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his exploits and leadership in the bitter fighting on Los Negros island . " With his letter , General Swift enclosed copies of the squadron 's Unit Citation and the order awarding the D.S.C . to Lieutenant Colonel Lobit . The Post is glad to make the correction and is heartened by this evidence that even in a busy war an Army general can retain his thoughtful regard for those serving with him . fact was that small plants received an increasing proportion of the work , Their output was of surprisingly high quality . Only a fraction of 1 per cent of the 3000 firms fell down on their contracts . Some of the new firms in shipbuilding made odd changes in their lines of manufacture . A fishing-tackle maker produced moaning buoys which signal the position of ships in convoys to avoid collisions . A Texas blacksmith hammered out stanchions for ship rails . Manufacturers of greenhouse fittings produced a variety of ship installations . There are dozens of such examples , equally strange . It would take a Walt Disney picture to elucidate all the processes of mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat or invasion ship , the first design is sometimes a sketch made by a naval officer on a sheet of paper . This is worked out more fully at the Bureau of Ships in the Navy Department . In mnny cases , the preliminary plans then go to Gibbs . Gibbs . according to those who work with him , can build a ship in his imagination with remarkable speed . From a few hints , the detailed picture of a ship fashions itself in his mind , just as an experienced playwright may be able to see a three-act play from curtain to curtain as soon as he has the central idea . Many difficult problems may remain to be worked out , but , according to his lieutenants , it is a rare thing for Gibbs ' spontaneous image of a ship to be found wrong in any important particular . Gibbs is afraid of arithmetic . An eightyear-old child can beat him at adding , subtracting and dividing . He wo n't trust figures until a machine has gone over them three times . Testifying before a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incompetence , to do mental arithmetic of the kind that is taught in the third grade . He spent many years on the tremendous mathematics that go into ships . This trained him to conjure up mental pictures of complete ships , but the processes of calculation are no longer part of his consciousness . His power to create new and strange craft in his mind has been of particular value in speeding the invasion fleet , which is a new order of creation in the history of the sea . Gibbs uses ship models of a new type in speeding up mass production . These contain every detail of the hull , machinery and fittings , down to the boiler gauges and cooking equipment . Some of the models are more than twenty-six feet long and are accurate to within one sixty-fourth part of an inch . The model room looks like a Santa Claus shop for the gods up on Mt . Olympus . There is nothing else in the world today like this titanic toyland . But the models are not playthings , although grown-up children lose their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production . They have saved many millions in the shipbuilding program and have rushed the launching of thousands of ships . The models are " bug catchers , " or error detectors . The model is built as the working plans for a ship are drawn . If there is a bad idea of any kind in the design or even a clerical error in the blueprints , the mistake shows up in the miniature . Two bodies can occupy the same space in a blueprint , but not in a model . According to bibliophiles , only one book was ever printed without n single typographical error ; probably no complicated ship plan has ever been turned out without many inaccuracies . Formerly , the mistake was discovered in the shipyards , when certain parts of the ship failed to fit together correctly . Blueprints had to be drawn over again , and new parts ordered . Time and money were wasted . In ordinary years , no great harm was done . In the big program of today , however , a single error in a plan could cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one plan . Thousands of ship parts might have to be condemned and reordered , and a whole program would be set back for weeks . But the model is built before the blueprints are sent to the building yards and before the ship equipment is ordered . An error in the model can be corrected in a few minutes or hours at the cost of a few dollars . Ship models , of course , are nothing new . They are found in Egyptian tombs . They were used in the Elizabethan days in the actual construction of ships , the builder studying the model and making the ship conform to it . The Electric Boat Company , in 1931 , made full-scale models , or mock-ups , of wood , so that naval officers could make sure that the machinery was conveniently arranged . Back in 1937 , the Navy wanted Gibbs to make full-scale wooden models of destroyers . Gibbs did n't like the idea ; for one reason , it was impossible to find room in office buildings in lower Manhattan for a full-size destroyer model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had studied many of the great collections of old ship models , and finally the idea occurred to him of building fairly large models of the greatest exactitude . This would show whether machinery was arranged feasibly , and could also be used to catch any flaw in the drawings . The idea worked wonderfully . It has practically changed the art of ship design from drawing to sculpture . Two experts were engaged for the work in 1937 ? Mattson , a ship-model artist , and Theodore N. Matheson , a famous builder of midget locomotives and indoor grand-trunk lines . Today , more than 100 craftsmen are employed in the Gibbs &; Cox model shop . At first , the innovation was n't popular with engineers and blueprint makers . They were annoyed at the presumption of the model men in claiming to catch them in errors . The model men scored a big victory , however , when they showed that one set of blueprints called for putting a steel upright , or stanchion , right through the middle of an engine . In another case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would place part of the engine-room machinery outside of the hull . This proposed monstrosity was found to be a typographical error . In one controversy , the modelmakers lost out . They had reported that certain machinery was too high for the space assigned to it . The blueprint men denied it . THE SATURDAY make u death chamber of the ship . The Bureau of Ships and the Gibbs organization discarded the hood idea and started experimenting on enormous fans to blow air out of the ship and draw fresh nir in . British designers had considered this imposeible , because ' of the danger that the fans would ventilate only part , of the space , leaving dangerouti elution-monoxide pockets in the atmosphere . From the Holland Tunnel experiences and studies inn &; by the Bureau of Mines and other organizations , it was decided that if the carbon monoxide could be kept leas than four parts in 10.000 , the holds of the LST 's would be habitable for at least an hour . Experiments with fans were first made in a small building at Aberdeen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tested with tanks in actual operation at Fort Knox . Canaries , the classic measuring rods for carbon monoxide , were used . As long as they remained lively , it was known that the gas in the atmosphere was too dilute to be injurious . The final decision was that twelve fans , each blowing air at the rate of 35,000 cubic feet per minute , would keep an LST safe . The fans were tested with the model 1ST filled with smoke . As the fans blew the C smoke out , fresh air was drawn in from ducts opening on the upper deck . The fresh air shot down through the smoke in transparent columns , hitting the floor and then swirling away in all directions , soon clearing the ship of smoke . With all the fans going , a man had to use both hands to keep his hat on . In actual practice , it was never found necessary to keep all twelve fans going at once . With the use of Diesel engines , which produce less carbon monoxide , the fresh-air problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be solved in the LST 's and other landing craft . They were not only novelties but paradoxes , as they flew in the face of the art of navigation . It used to be a court-martial offense to beach a ship . The idea of building craft for the deliberate purpose of running it aground called for a new psychology on the part of designers and navigators . Such a ship had to be made enormously strong , so that the shock of beaching would not crumple it up , and so that it could escape damage from conflicting stresses when the bow rested on is beach and the rest of the craft rested on the waves . The water drawn in to cool the engines had to be specially filtered to keep the beach sand from clogging the pipes . The mighty bow doors had to be equipped with cuffs that turned up automatically in order to prevent the lower outer corners from striking the beach . Full of new engineering from stem to stern , the 1ST was a success from the start . The most curious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Landing Ship , Dock  --  which is practically a floating landlocked harbor full of small landing craft . It carries a fleet of invasion ships on its back , as a Surinam toad carries its young . Approaching a coastline marked for attack , the LSD is partly flooded and the small attacking craft swarm out under their own power . Later , they swarm back into the mother ship , the landlocked harbor is emptied and the small fleet is carried away by the LSD as in a dry dock . Gibbs did the working plans for this freak of the seas . Its usefulness as a war weapon is for the future to determine . Japart 's aggression against China and Manchuria was indirectly responsible for the career of Gibbs as II naval designer . That aggression put un end to the tenyear-old naval holiday . Anticipating a big program of warship construction , the Navy wanted as many firms as possible to start work on fighting craft . With the encouragement of Vice Admirals S. M. Robinson and Emory S. Land , Gibbs , in 1933 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships were built from fills plan  --  two each by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company , heeded by Lynn H. Komi:k-IT ; the Bath Iron Works , headed by William S. Newell ; and the United Shipyards , headed by Joseph W. Powell . Gibbs procured the materials . The great feature of these ships was the use of high-pressure steam for propelling them . The new machinery passed through one of the hottest controversies in the history of the Navy before it was finally conceded to be an improvement . The controversy did not really end until British admirals were demanding to be informed what was wrong with their marine engineers and why their ships were equipped with backward machinery , as compared with American ships . Those who opposed the new machinery were not necessarily narrow-minded or backward-looking . The most important thing about machinery to a naval officer is reliability . Under ordinary circumstances , new machinery would be tested for years on a single ship before its reliability was considered established . But events were moving too fast in the later 30 's for the normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be built at once , and the decision had to be made whether to use the Gibbs ideas or discard them . Supported by many younger officers , the leading champions of Gibbs were Vice Admiral S. M. Robinson , Rear Admiral Harold G. Bowen and Charles Edison , then Assistant Secretary of the Navy . Admiral William D. Leahy , who was Chief of Naval Operations during the hottest part of the controversy , was disturbed by the multitude of gloomy predictions about the new engineering . He called in Rear Admiral Bowen , chief of the Bureau of Engineering , and pounded his desk , " Bowen , " he said , " I 've got to have reliable machinery in these ships . " " Admiral . " said Bowen , " I 'm not going to be responsible for building an obsolete Navy . " After going more deeply into the situation , Admiral Leahy felt less worried . Upon seeing the new ships in action under war conditions , he became enthusiastic . On May 7 , 1943 , he wrote a letter to Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight " almost singlehanded " for the new machinery . It is my opinion now , " he added , " that the superior efficiency and economy of our naval ships , as compared with those of our Allies , results from the adop 3.1945 Admiraltpi propulsive u s o vhsei high-pressure machinery advocated higlitemp The " high-temperature , high-pressure " machinery is a technical subject , but - high-temperature there ors points in connection with it which a layman can gruel . Fundamentally , it was the application of great strides which American public utilities had made in their power plants to the propulsion of ships . Land plants were using steam heated up to 1000 degrees Fahrenheit , when 300 was considered high in ships . The high temperature produced increased energy with a smaller consumption of fuel . Most marine engineers believed that the advances made in land machinery were not applicable to Gibbs thought differsea machinery . ently . He induced several of the great manufacturers of equipment for land power stations to join him in an effort to produce better ship machinery . The problem was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company , the Babcock &; Wilcox Company , the Foster-Wheeler Corporation and the De Laval Steam Turbine Company . The new machinery was first used in ships designed by Gibbs for the Grace Line . It was first used by the Navy in ships of the Mahan class launched in 1935 . Skeptics in the Navy considered it too complicated for hard usage . It was reported that the steam heated the pipes cherry red , that it caused danger of fires and explosions , that the machinery would probably break down easily , and that crews were afraid of it . In time , however , the new machinery proved itself rugged and reliable , as well as powerful and efficient . Superior alloys and brilliant feats of design had made the machinery safe , in spite of its complexity . Crews soon got used to it . The high temperatures and pressures made it possible to use smaller and lighter engines . Gibbs doubled the horsepower of destroyer engines and built them in approximately half the space previously occupied , making it possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Previously , most of the American Navy machinery had been of British design , manufactured in this country under license from a British engineering firm . The new machinery pioneered by Gibbs created a great new American industry , which has been of incalculable importance in the war .
