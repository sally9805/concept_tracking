With an almost cosmic calm , two great U.S. physicists , both Nobel Prizemen , last week joined again in spirited dispute over the nature of cosmic rays . The scene of the controversy was the annual meeting of Washington 's National Academy of Sciences . It was not the first such dignified disagreement between devout , handsome Arthur Holly Compton , of the University of Chicago , and pious , white-crested Robert Andrews Millikan of California Institute of Technology . Several years ago Millikan reached the conclusion that cosmic rays consist of tiny , electrically neutral packets of radiation called photons . Compton insisted that they were electrically charged material particles . By 1936 most physicists judged that Compton was right . And Millikan agreed-for science is an even more sporting game than tennis . <P> Three big cosmic ray questions then remained to be answered : 1 ) The rays may be electrical particles , but are they electrons , positrons , protons , * or what ? 2 ) From what parts of space do the rays shower upon the earth ? 3 ) What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetrating energies up to several hundred billion electron volts ? <P> When the speeding particles of cosmic radiation hit the earth 's upper 5% of atmosphere , like billiard balls they pass their energy on to other particles knocked from the nuclei of atmospheric atoms . Hence cosmic radiation at sea level is of a secondary nature , consisting largely of mesotrons-particles intermediate in mass between electrons and protons . So up into high altitudes Physicist Compton sent his instruments to seek the nature-not the number , as earlier altitude studies had sought-of the primary rays . <P> Last week he reported that the primary particles 1 ) can penetrate as much as seven inches of lead , 2 ) do not set off showers of new particles when striking a lead plate . But electrons , physicists know for sure , can penetrate only four inches of lead and definitely produce secondary showers of lead particles . Concluded Physicist Compton : primary cosmic rays can not be electrons , must consist almost solely of the heavier , more energized protons . <P> But unruffled Physicist Millikan insisted last week that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much further . He announced , after some ten years of brooding and research , that cosmic rays result from the self-annihilation of atoms in interstellar space . <P> Certain nebulae in interstellar space seem to contain five elements-helium , carbon , nitrogen , oxygen and silicon-each of which is ten times as abundant as any other element except hydrogen . Experiments with atom-smashing machines and theoretical reckoning indicate that annihilation of a helium atom produces energy of 1.9 billion electron volts , of carbon 5.6 , of nitrogen 6.6 , of oxygen 7.5 , of silicon 13.2 . <P> The earth itself is a great spinning magnet which deflects incoming electrical particles in several ways . Only the strongest cosmic rays can penetrate the earth 's far-flung magnetic field at the magnetic equator , but even the weakest can get in near the magnetic poles . Thus a physicist traveling away from the magnetic equator should be able to detect one by one the appearance of new bands of cosmic energy as the earth 's resistance weakens . And these energy bands should correspond to the kinds of disintegrating atoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
