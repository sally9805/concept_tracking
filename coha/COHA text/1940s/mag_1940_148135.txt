Gestapo Chief Heinrich Himmler and Deputy Fhrer Rudolf Hess last week set the seal of qualified official approval on bastardy . Herr Himmler sounded off in an " order to the entire SS ( Elite Guard ) and the police " : <P> " The ancient saying that only he can die peacefully who has sons and daughters must be translated into fact during this war by the SS . Beyond the limits of bourgeois laws and customs which ordinarily are probably necessary , it can become an exalted task even outside of wedlock for German women and girls of good blood to become-not frivolously but imbued with deepest moral concern-mothers of children begotten by soldiers moving to the front without knowing whether they will return or die for the Fatherland . " <P> In a letter to an unmarried expectant mother whose fianc was killed in Poland , Deputy Fhrer Hess declared : " During war especially , which so often means death for the best men , every new life is of extraordinary importance . Hence , if young soldiers fall on behalf of the Fatherland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry and who leave children behind , the State will take care of this national treasure . "
