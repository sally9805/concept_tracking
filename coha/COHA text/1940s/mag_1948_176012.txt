In spite of Japan 's new coeducational schools , which are warmly encouraged by the U.S. , Japanese schoolboys were still acting like aloof little gentlemen-they kept away from the girls , scorned anyone who did n't . In one high school , students got so mad at a classmate who went around with girls that they killed him . <P> How long would the gentlemen keep their distance ? Not much longer , thought the Osaka Prefectural Education Committee . Last week , with an eye to future emergencies , the committee issued a one-page Etiquette Concerning the Association Between Boys and Girls for all school kids . Principal pointers : " All associations between the two sexes must be lucid ; there must be no secrets . . . Do n't confuse friendship with love . . . Avoid physical contact with the opposite sex . . . Use straightforward , refined , beautiful language . . . When visiting one of the opposite sex , you must sit facing each other . It is not good etiquette to sit alongside each other when there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after dusk with one of the opposite sex . . . Refrain from bringing up unrefined topics in conversation . . . Always make clear your intentions . . . "
