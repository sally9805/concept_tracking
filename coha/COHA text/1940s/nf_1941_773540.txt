txt // WITHIN THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES the school has begun to act on the correct assumption that it owes the student considerably more than just drill in the three R 's . Educators have become concerned with the growth of the whole personality . And they are particularly interested in the maintenance of physical and mental health . When I attended the Newark , N. J. schools not so many years ago there were no such things as health courses . Today they are compulsory for everybody . Teachers-in-training are required to take courses in health instruction no matter what their subject is to be . Why the change ? There were two main influences . First , during the World War draft civic leaders were shocked at the number of men who were declared physically unfit for military service . Secondly , the work of Sigmund Freud and his group made us complex-conscious . We discovered that people behaved queerly not because they were ornery or stupid but because they were psychologically sick . They were unable to adjust themselves successfully because of secret fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their subconscious imps . Then the dizzy tempo of the jazz age caught 8o // many unprepared and this further complicated the problem . A hue and cry was set up resulting in the school 's taking over a major share of the national burden of promoting physical and mental well-being . But especially for the latter the scholastic program is still pitifully inadequate . The extent to which the school can preserve bodily health is naturally limited because it can not very well control such obstacles as improper housing and insufficient nutrition . With mental hygiene more can be done , but less is . In some of the larger systems there are special guidance counselors , experts in their field , who spend all their time dealing with problems of mental hygiene . But the guidance bureaus are generally too understaffed for their immense task . Furthermore , there is much waste . The counselors must take cases on the recommendation of the teacher and the latter almost always sends down students who are disciplinary problems . He can not handle the situation himself and so he passes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need of advice than the maladjusted ones who are the quiet , " goody-goody " type . The shy , retiring child , who is the worst off , receives no attention whatsoever . In the vast majority of schools , however , guidance must come from the instructors themselves . Here two evil conditions prevail . In the first place , many are either incapable of or do not care to administer mental hygiene . And secondly , what with heavy pupil loads , // much incidental work , and no time to investigate backgrounds thoroughly , they could n't do a good job even if they knew how . Adolescents in particular are in dire need of help . They face a hard world with not enough strength and precious little assurance . Their fears are shamed into secrecy . They first learn the meaning of sexual desire with its inevitable frustrations . Their attempts to adapt themselves to adult standards are seldom happy ones because of their insufficient experience and knowledge , their weak powers of articulation , their lack of grace and security and self-confidence . Almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so , like a hurt wild thing , they retreat within themselves . Accordingly they develop neuroses , complexes , fixations and what not . Nobody has ever compiled a total of high-school students who are pathologically maladjusted , but if such a study should be made I warrant the figures would be appalling . But mental hygiene embraces much more than merely the treatment . of psychotics . It is preventive as well as therapeutic . It is just as important to keep the normal healthy as to cure the moribund . Guidance for healthy , happy living must be given , therefore , to every single student . At this point the average teacher in a moment of candor may ask himself helplessly : " What do I know about psychoanalysis ? " Many instructors realize the true // state of affairs and would like to do something about it . But they are stopped , frightened by the sonorous terminology and by the involved practices of the psychoanalysts . It is n't necessary , however , to be a master of psychopathology . Laughter ? simple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental hygiene we have . The specific techniques of the professional psychiatrist are intended to accomplish the selfsame ends that laughter does ? diversion , objectivity , elimination of fear and not taking oneself too seriously . Indeed , laughter is nature 's way of psychiatry . That mental health is dependent upon physical wellbeing is almost axiomatic . The neurotic has never startled anyone by his robustness . On the contrary , nervous breakdowns and mental disorders are invariably treated by packing the patient off to the countryside where he may rest and build up his bodily strength . Physical defects like hunchbacks , clubfeet , excessive shortness or obesity , bad skin and so forth are in themselves causes of mental aberration . People who enjoy ill health are apt to be unduly concerned with themselves , to be worried and querulous , to take things too much to heart . And they end up by becoming psychically unbalanced . Laughter , the mere act of risibility , is an important and usually underrated factor in physical health . Men of medicine know this and they make good use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Laughter has a distinct place in therapeutics , or at least in the mainte84 LAUGH AND LEARN nance of health . . . . All men laugh more or less , but those who laugh the most are the ones that live the longest and enjoy the best health . " The salutary effect of mirth has a manifold physiological basis . By causing convulsive movements of the diaphragm laughter massages the vital organs and tones them up . In this modern age of acute civilization exercise for many people is something that may be bought for a dollar an hour from any good masseur . What with cars , subways , elevators and other conveniences , those who lead a sedentary life get hardly any exercise at all and for them frequent belly-laughter is a necessity if they are to avoid becoming sluggish and ill . Respiration is benefited by hilarity . The laugh forces an extra-large quantity of air to leave the lungs explosively . Consequently on the rebounding inhalation more air is taken in and there is deeper oxidation . The lungs are thus strengthened and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cardiac stimulant . The internal organs are jostled , blood rushes to them , and the heart action is stepped up . The organs of digestion , the liver , pancreas , stomach and various glands , tend to develop functional disorders if they are not sufficiently exercised . The burden of breaking up our soggy , devitalized foods is a heavy one and the liver , for example , must secrete its bile at maximum efficiency . But due to lack of proper // exercise it is not equal to the task . And so there is a tremendous market for liver pills . But infinitely better than any drug is hearty laughter with its gentle , stimulating massage . Laughter is also a moving aid toperistalsis . And nothing so stultifies the mind as chronic constipation . Laughter is indubitably a tonic to the nervous system .  - -  It is nature 's safety valve for the release of pent-up , surplus nervous energy . Hence the heightened tendency to risibility in moments of tension such as sexual awareness , enforced decorum , waiting for a test or an important interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of horseplay or badinage , in the drive of secret desires , in concentrated work over a period of time . That superfluous energy must be drained off in laughter . This is why students laugh and shout when the bell rings to end the class period . Hypersensitive teachers interpret the phenomenon as joy in getting out of their clutches , but it is simply a nervous release . If surplus neural energy is habitually not tapped by mirth it must explode to the detriment of mental well-being.The result is neuroticism . Merry people are rarely nervous wrecks . Laughter induces emotional stability and is therefore a profound influence for mental health . Riotous feelings which must be inhibited by the curb of social pressure are the main feeding grounds of psychopathology . A strong emotion seizes upon a person and assumes a // place in his life altogether out of proportion to its importance . It entwines itself vinelike about his whole thinking process and attitude toward the world . It feeds parasitically on all his energies and stunts his growth as a personality . The outcome is painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To be sure , sex is as fundamental a drive as any we could mention offhand . But it is n't everything . It can be overdone , and often is . Individuals who are abnormally preoccupied with the evidences of physical love think of little else . They see sexual symbolism in everything ? in oval depressions of trees , in doorlocks , in doughnuts and wooden matches . They are forever on the lookout for vicarious thrills through nude pictures , smutty stories and suggestive movements . In public lavatories they become literary . ho these badly-adjusted people sex becomes an end instead of a condition of life . Constant gratification is difficult or impossible . And so the frustrations mount up and mental health is impaired . Many are oversexed and the cause is more often psychological than physical . It is not a pretty fact to admit or to air publicly , but even at high-school age we find nymphomaniac tend encies , the rankest kind of exhibitionism , and the beginnings of various sorts of perversion . But why ostracize these things ? Better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrendous galaxy take their sex too seriously . // But love is not the only emotion which can become predominating enough to upset mental balance . Anger is another . A person has his ire aroused because someone has humiliated him . But he is unable to turn his wrath upon his tormentor because he is physically too weak or because he is in some way dependent upon the other fellow . The frustration is hard to endure and he broods about it . If this occurs often he may fall into a hate complex and live his entire life in terms of revenge . He becomes sadistic , insatiably cruel . He amuses himself by dismembering insects . He takes out his own disappointments on those who can not fight back . He is a lovely person to have around the house . The most prolific source of abnormality , however , is excessive fear . Everyone has fears , a few innate and most conditioned . That is natural . But when a fear becomes deep enough and habitual enough to be present when there is no cause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease . People thus afflicted are so attached to their fears that they will hang on to the creeping things even after logical analysis has shown them up as baseless and silly . The surest way to ward off emotional instability is to acquire an omnipresent sense of humor . The laughing individual is not a brooder . He does n't take any of his emotions too seriously . Besides , the habit of laughter makes him more objective . He is better prepared to evaluate things sanely and correctly . Even the most solemn of feelings or actions are comic when they are // overdone . And the person with a good sense of humor can perceive the incongruity even when it relates to himself . Laughter dissipates obsessions by creating a diversion . Attention is momentarily disengaged and the hypnotic spell is broken . Obsession is very common among the immature minds of youngsters . They become engrossed in the most piddling situations and can not shake there off . Here is a bright lass whose hands perspire . She is so sensitive about her sweaty palms that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance at her she is examining her unfortunate extremities . They fascinate her . In the other corner is a boy who regards one of his teachers with murder in his heart . That teacher once " made a fool of him " in class and now lie fancies that everyone is mocking him behind his back . Disdainful of anything like relevance he takes every opportunity to expatiate on the evil qualities of the man . These cases are typical . And they are n't wholesome . " Those students with monomanic proclivities arc in constant need of laughter . Regular diversion ? call it recreation ? is the best thing in the world for mental health . Morbidity is particularly widespread among highschool students . Some affect a morbid attitude as a way of being " different " and thus riveting attention upon themselves . Others do it in imitation of adults , thereby inferring that they are grown up . But unless the playLAUGHTER // acting is checked in time the affectation becomes reality . ' ' hen there is trouble . There are many , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and they take refuge in self-pitying utterance . Following is a very representative example : ELEGY TO A FLAME Dost thou seek comfort , warmth and light ? ' T is no more , the flame is dead . Aye , and I that have revelled in its light mourn it , For in the flickering flame danced my love . But when the shadow fell and the flame died , So went my love , And now I sing an elegy to both . This poem was written by a thirteen-year-old girl and she meant every word of it ! I ere is another typical offering : So you 've seen life , have you ; and it 's made a callous cynic of you , has it ? You 've read a few confession magazines and they have revealed some of the sordid aspects of life to you , have they ? Have you ever wanted something desperately , and then had to sit back in the realization of the fact that you could never have it ? So you 've lived , have you ? Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for someone to have mercy on their hunger-ridden faces , and offer them a crust of yesten day 's bread ? Have you ever watched the look of horror slid dismay creep into a man 's face as he realizes that what was once , is no more ? So you 've lived , have you ? Why you have n't been born yet 1 ! ! // The author undoubtedly fancies herself as a cynic . But she is wrong . Not skepticism but emotional stress is exhibited here . She is simply morbid . Many people imagine they are cynics but few really are . I have a friend who has dyspepsia , hyperacidity and general visceral non-cooperation thanks to the culinary gifts of the United Greeks of America . And so his whole outlook is , so to speak , bilious . But that 's misanthropy , not cynicism . I know a woman who was disappointed in love . She was very disappointed . She married the guy . This charming lady is an incarnate nostalgia for the Esthetic Absolute . Lovers must be combination Manfreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days bright and bacchanalian . She lives on Gauguin and T. S. Eliot and is a ray of sunshine in any man 's boudoir . Her husband , alas , is every bit as glamorous as a pickled eel . He is a good provider and a devoted spouse , but in the drawing room he is a total loss . He can not even talk a good game of tennis . Accordingly she considers herself perfectly justified in becoming hard and stalking around the house looking like Hedda Gabler . But this is not cynicism ; it is detoured romanticism . Nor is cynicism to be confused with that kind of swaggering degeneracy exemplified by Leopold and Loeb , the thrill-killers , and elevated to the dignity of international polity by such friends of the people as Hitler and Mussolini . Nor is it to be found among the cerebral // paralytics who always avoid thinking by answering every observation with a devastating , " So what ? " Real Antisthenic cynicism is purely intellectual in nature . It has nothing to do with the emotions . The true cynic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the language he ca n't abide is " faith " . Religious people sicken him . He is the sort of egg who would make his opponent in golf play out a two-inch putt and would howl with glee were it missed . At high-school age students are rarely developed enough to be cynical . They are too emotional . Their raillery against the world is thinly disguised self-pity . And their lachrymose mood may easily become chronic . Morbidity is cured by laughter . In fact , they are direct opposites . Inject a little of the anti-toxin of jollity into a student and then see how long his " blue funk " lasts ! A stern foe of mental health is worry . It is a monkey wrench in the cranial machinery and a decisive shortener of life . All of us worry more or less , unless we are idiots . But done to excess it is a crippling thing , a destroyer of sanity . I have seen many students worry themselves sick about everything ? about their marks , their families , their affairs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lutist be counteracted before it does . Mirth is the obvious reagent . For the duration of the ! merriment solicitude about the future is dispelled by absorption in immediacy . Fun attracts the entire attention and everything else is temporarily pushed out of // mind . A worry which has thus been broken seldom conies back as strong and sometimes disappears altogether . Laughter , like religion , is a refuge from trouble and suffering . Often it is the only thing which keeps people from going mad . A man has barely enough income to maintain life . He can do nothing but stare at the blank walls in his two-by-four room . His wife is miserable and his children undernourished . Only if he can occasionally drink from the springs of laughter in hilarious jamborees " with the boys " can he remain sane in that bleak existence of his . Some do n't laugh , and the consequences are terrible to contemplate . A Chicago man in just such a condition killed his wife and five children and then put a bullet through his own head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so unbearable as insistent . But he ca n't do anything he wants to or ought to do . And he begins to crack under the strain . Dementia praecox is the inevitable result unless he can break the monotony of steady discomfort through laughter . The mere act of laughing is to overwrought emotions what an alkaline solution is to an acid stomach . It neutralizes and settles and thereby preserves mental health . The merry individual rarely falls into psychological difficulties . Probably the most frequent cause of maladjustment among students is the inferiority complex , that poisonous weed which grows in everyone 's backyard . An obsessive feeling of inferiority may be cultivated from a limitless // variety of seeds . An older brother may have ridiculed your speech before others . Perhaps in childhood you were too anemic to play football with the other boys and they told you so , calling you " sissy . " You may have been termed a " dope " by one of your grade teachers and been assigned to slower classes . The one who first proposed segregation according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe you have heard older and better-looking boys or girls talk about their amatory conquests , and you have become pessimistic about your chances of attracting members of the opposite sex . People develop inferiority complexes about anything and everything . They are too fat or too skinny ; too tall or too short . Jones has a better car . Smith has more admirable parents . Because they feel inferior they are insecure . They stammer and withdraw within themselves and are so awkward they never seem to do anything right . And all this makes them feel even more inferior . Laughter is the best antidote to inferiority complexes . - Those which grow out of fear respond to comic treatment because mirth routs fear . With other kinds also the principle of laughter holds true . A sense of humor produces objectivity and prevents us from becoming too much concerned with an inferiority which may or may not be genuine . The Declaration of Independence notwithstanding , we are not born equal . We all come into the world with differing natural endowments . And nurture deepens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept normal through laughter can understand that in relation to others he has certain superiorities as well as inferiorities . He may not be as strong physically as the school 's star halfback , but at least he gets higher marks in class . I never read Dale Carnegie but I can always make friends and influence students by the simple device of calling attention to some ability , condition , or aspect of personality in which the individual excels others . This is more than a maneuver to gain popularity ; with unsound egos it falls under the heading of required pedagogy . Everyone , no matter how insignificant he is , must be made to feel by others that he is a " somebody , " or else he crumbles . People who suffer with obsessions of inferiority tend to be egocentric . They are perpetually occupied with themselves . They withdraw reflectively from others and become unsocial , even antisocial . They interpret the world only in terms of their own feelings . They speak with a habitual " I. " In extreme cases they become egomaniacs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their associates react against them and ostracize them . And they are confirmed misfits . Laughter can stop such a denouement . Merriment snaps a person out of himself and makes him a cooperating member of hilarious commune . If his mirth be frequent he will have no time to brood himself into trouble . There are other kinds of severe maladjustment prevalent among students . The persecution complex is a // common one . Father and mother fixations may be found in every school . Then there are the various phobias about snakes , fire , cats , closed rooms , etcetera . We have kleptomaniacs , pyromaniacs and schizophrenics . Every species of psychological defection is there . All of them interfere with effective learning as well as social adjustment . And all of them may be dissipated by laughter . Out-and-out cases of maladjustment should be sent to the school doctor . Something physical , like defective hearing or vision or an organic disease , may be the matter . In the complicated cases it would be well to consult a professional psychiatrist . But for most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The best of techniques is the private , informal interview . I make it a practice to give the maladjusted student some special job to do which would give us a natural excuse for meeting tote-a-tete . Then by joking with him I win his confidence . Laughter is a disarming force . It gives a person a more expansive outlook and greater generosity in offering of himself . The system works . These students tell me everything . Once I know what is bothering them it is a simple matter to laugh it off . Extreme care must be taken , however , not to deride the student himself . Nothing is accomplished unless he himself can see the humor of the nit station . A very effective method of poking fun at an obsessive idea is to present yourself as having had a similar one . Then belittle the idea by frivolous treat96 LAUGH AND LEARN ment . Even more efficacious than your words is the living example of your light-hearted attitude toward the whole thing . If no analogous occurrence has ever happened to you , invent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying . Burlesque , with accompanying exaggeration , is another productive method . Let us take by way of illustration the youngster with a persecution complex . He imagines that a certain teacher is out to ruin him . This thought so possesses him that his whole personality is warped by it . You tell him about someone who is deathly afraid of little redheaded girls because he thinks that all of them live for the sole purpose of pulling his hair out . Your manner of telling the story should approach high farce . And the student can afford to chuckle because he feels superior . He is n't afraid of redheaded girls . Sooner or later he must realize the identity of his own condition with that of the person in the anecdote . By that time , however , the serum has already started to work . He has once laughed at his obsession and never again can he take it as seriously as formerly . I know a woman who was too much influenced by Walt Whitman . She tried to live his poetry . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiate health as a matter of principle , and would do such fantastically joyous things as hugging the earth , singing on trolley cars and kissing flowers . In short , she was a Whitmaniac . One evening she read some parodies on Whitman and laughed so hard that now she ca n't // regard a single Leaf of Grass without smiling . Definitely the potentialities of burlesque have been grievously underestimated . There are other possible methods . But the important thing is to get the student to laugh at himself . The moment he does that he is saved . It is the teacher 's duty not only to treat maladjustiuent but also to help prevent it . He can do this by permitting or promoting hilarity in his classes . If all children could learn to laugh frequently and with gusto there would be less need for psychiatric clinics. // WHAT IS THE CREATIVE SPIRIT ? We know it belongs to those who write Divine Comedies or compose Nibelungen Rings or paint Last Suppers . Very briefly then , it is the property of those who produce art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anything which is created from raw materials and which is beautiful may be art . How about the baking of a cake ? Yes and no . If the cake is baked from a recipe and for the sole , utilitarian purpose of eating it , it is not art . The missing element is creative intelligence . If , on the other hand , there is among the motives for baking sheer joy in devising new and lovely forms of pastry then the process does become artistic . Art embraces invention , imagination , skill and a conscious sense of esthetic . Perhaps I may best illustrate the creative spirit by referring to creative education . The psalmsingers of progressive education ? among whom I am pleased to include myself ? have written so extensively and have pulpitized so loudly about it that a whiff of the Great Idea must have penetrated the deepest of backwoods and the most petrified of teacher-minds . A whole new terminology of pedagogy has arisen ? activity school , Dalton 98 // plan , platoon system , Gary plan , contract system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordinary lay teacher of the old school all this is somewhat confusing . He entertains visions of special , involved methods , special materials and special administ native forms . To him who has always taught the way he was taught all this seems so novel and complicated that Ile despairs of ever learning it . You ca n't teach an old dog new tricks . This is what he feels but does n't say . Meanwhile he sees his comfortable security being threatened by a revolution he does n't understand and he reacts , sometimes viciously , against the young and noisy progressives . But creative education , no matter what the specific shape it assumes , is founded on one very simple , cardinal principle , a principle which may be applied successfully even in the most conservative school set-up imaginable . This is that learning should be an active instead of a passive process . Instead of allowing the student to sit ( back more or less quiescently to receive an arbitrary fund of information the teacher should induce him to reach out actively for it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be encouraged to create his own materials of learning . Not the acquisition of facts but interest in them should be stressed . Freedom to express himself on any subject and in his own way , is better for the pupil than conformance to uniform standards . The principle demands a reorientation of values which would place the highest premium // on creativity , not memory . It establishes that every student is a thinking individual and not a recording machine for the teacher 's notes , that a labor of love is worth a dozen jobs performed as a duty , and that the only way to learn about life is to live it . A concrete example may make clearer how the principle operates . Let us consider for a moment the dull subject of word study . In the average English class a number of words are given periodically to the students for memorization . As often as not the words selected would n't be used in everyday speech even if the pupil knew how to use them . The words out of context are then put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a test . This is a marvelous way of how not to build a vocabulary . The creative method of vocabulary training attempts to find the specific words which express a general idea in which there is an immediate interest . Someone , for instance , who is trying to write a composition asks , " What is another way of saying walking ' ? " The instructor throws the question to the class and the terms start coming in : " strolling , sauntering , swaggering , staggering , shuffling , stepping , marching , traipsing , " and so on . Those the students miss the teacher tells them , but only after they have honestly tried to think of them themselves . Words learned in this manner are not easily forgotten . And the teacher whose whole approach is in consonance with the fundamental principle as set down // is administering creative education whether he teaches in a progressive school or not . Creativity is a way of thinking ( manifested , of course , through action ) , and like any other mental process is developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely studying them will result in a habit of creative response that is seldom broken in later life . The outcome is a creative person , a doer rather than a spectator . Why is it important to cultivate the creative spirit ? First of all , it makes for infinitely more efficient learning . That which we create we know and love as the mother knows and loves her child . The learning which is ladled out to us like a dose of cod liver oil we may either remember or forget . In any case it does n't mean much to us . That which we have to fight for , however , we clasp to our bosoms and it remains forever part of iis . Furthermore , because in creation the product of one 's labor is tangible and directly attributable to himself , he takes more pride in his work , and consequently more pains with it . Should his artistic effort be rewarded with approval he can hope for no greater glory . And there is another fine motivation for hard studying . Secondly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is the person who is responsible for progress . He is the inventor , the pioneer , the author of new ideas . Where there is destruction or decay he rebuilds . His calculating brain is the dynamic force which preserves and extends mankind 's mastery of the // universe . Because he is an independent thinker he is not easily beguiled into joining mass movements which threaten to pervert or to demolish man 's hard-won gains . And because he has the ability to express himself well he can convince others . Thus is he a pillar of strength in upholding the lofty arches of a free social order . From a purely sociological point of view he is the salt of the earth , worth more than all the gold in the hills . The creator is per se a better , more self-satisfactory person . Ile is a leader among men and his is the respect and devotion of those who follow him . This naturally gives him a sense of power . His work is meaningful and important to himself and therefore he does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not compelled to look to others for his mode of life . He can and does formulate his own values to suit himself . His is a life of giving , and the act of bestowing affords more happiness than vast riches or prestige , than temporal power or beautiful women . Faust found that out . The creative individual is unafraid because he is strong and resourceful , and therefore he can be kind and just . His supernormal skill fulfills his elemental need for security . There is a third reason why the training of the creative spirit is much to be desired . The man who has played tennis himself is a more understanding spectator and a more severe critic at tennis matches . He will not be satisfied by shoddy work . If the players he is watchIIt1MOR // lug happen to be doing poorly he will walk away in disgust . His interest can be held by nothing but ever higher standards of performance . Likewise , if all students were encouraged to become amateur writers the quality of our literature would shoot skyward . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would become great literary artists . But because they have written themselves they have the best possible basis for knowing and appreciating good writing . They will not be satisfied by much of the sinkwater slop that passes for literature these days . They would be a discriminating and participating audience who would impel the author to do increasingly better work . For every creative artist produces for an audience . Art for art 's sake is a myth which has been so thoroughly spiked that I shall refrain from doing so lest I be accused of rattling the bones of a skeleton . If the spirit of creativity belonged to the many instead of the few , it is apparent that our culture would inevitably grow higher and finer . This would be a better world and we would n't have to narcotize ourselves with fairy tales of paradise . A person in the activity of creation partakes of the nature of divinity . God too is a creator . Every artist builds his own Tower of Babel . And although he never completes the construction job and is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to heaven than the groundlings can ever hope to reach . // Humor is one of the vitamins for the growth of the creative spirit . It is not a sine qua non condition , of course , but it is a substantial impetus and as such merits the careful attention of educators . Let us see how the comic aids in the matter of creative English , for instance . There is an old maxim to the effect that artistic success is composed of ten percent inspiration and ninety percent perspiration . I would n't swear to the accuracy of the figures , but the principle is correct . The ability to write consists of two fundamental things ? having something to say and knowing how to say it . The former is acquired through general growth and experience . But the latter is a specific skill which is achieved only through intensive training . There is no such animal as a born writer . Every known author has been put through his paces whether he is largely self-taught , like Walt Whitman , or schooled to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arises . The fledgling writer must learn what to do and what not to do with his adjectives . He must learn to use words deftly and effectively , and not fumble them as if they were hot potatoes . He must know his grammar well enough to use proper construction automatically . All the elements of style ? paragraphing , sentence structure , punctuation , figures of speech , choice of words , sonority , unity , coherence , tra-la-la ? must be mastered by him . He must have more than a speaking acquaintance with the literary forms . // His is sense of dramatic fitness should be sufficiently developed to lead him unerringly to choose the best possible form for what he has to say . All this may be acquired only by hard , continuous study . It means lectures , drill , assigned readings , research , recapitulatory tests and laboratory experiments . Very dull work . The average student ? and I can sympathize with him ? does n't think the reward of producing a short story is worth all that effort . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Miltons . Humor , however , can radically change the picture . The lure of the laugh is so great that if mirth is coupled with drill in composition students will swallow it and like it . Garnish your presentation of participial constructions with a little Attic salt and your pupils will roar their approval and ask for more . Let their experience with sonnet-form be a jolly one and they will learn the lesson avidly and unforgettably . And later on , when the class is but a pleasant memory , they will attempt sonnets . King Laughter transmutes every labor as with magic wand into a joyous thing . Reed Smith realized that when as a conscious tool he put humor into his admirable text , Learning to Write. * There is no good reason under the sun why the study of rhetoric , or any other academic subject for that matter , need be a solemn affair . The way most classes are conducted it would be io6 LAUGH AND LEARN appropriate for students to wear funereal black not only at commencement but all through the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write is to write . But authorship , even for the greatest men of letters , is an agonizing process . Facility comes only with long practice , and to many not at all . The first attempts at literary flight , moreover , are generally pitiful . The student may easily become discouraged and quit , unless he regards writing as fun . One of the ways to insure that wholesome attitude is to have him write about something he enjoys , namely , the comic . Humor is a fertile and fruitful field for exercise in composition . Recently a member of our Creative Writing Club , a very earnest but not excessively brilliant girl , sought me out to tell me her problem . She had her heart set on writing a short story as good as or better than those produced by her colleagues , but she just could n't think of anything about which to write . I told her that embryonic stories are running wild around us all the time if we but knew how to look for them . To prove it I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pointed out a half dozen potential stories . I then advised her to look for her own ideas and to show me them on the morrow . The following day she came in with seven suitable incidents , six of them humorous . Does this suggest anything ? Humor is a particularly happy medium for compositional drill because it meets with easy success . The // storm-and-stress of the grand passions does n't always find a responsive audience . I recall the painful chagrin of a very serious young poet who insisted upon reading his latest poem of the Soul in Torment at a gay party where interest was centered in cocktails , colorful anecdotes and necking . From what I could hear of the piece through some choice gossip about Helen or Ellen 's most recent dive into the sea of certainly-notmatrimony , it seemed to be a rather creditable performance . But its premiere was nevertheless a magnificent flop . Students especially are seldom in the mood for tragedy or high poetry . Only a superlative offering can capture their attention . There is the second point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes ridiculous . And the reward is a laughter which stings worse than the lash . Of all possible reactions youngsters are quickest to mirth . They are ready for it at any time . They will indulge in it even without adequate justification . That is why humor is the safest kind of writing for the maiden efforts of the classroom . Levity is the outcome sought and levity is what the author will get whether his work is truly comic or merely silly . The following atrocious bit of verse was greeted with gratifying laughter and applause and the writer sat down unutterably pleased . Boys will pass and boys will flunk , And this English stuff is a lot of bunk ; I 've written these lines for better or worse But I ai n't yet rhymed a single verse . lob LAUGH AND LEARN I am the bad boy of the class , Mr. Ormond says I wo n't pass . Although I act like a goon , I 'm not the worst one in the room . That was his first attempt and his " success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with practice . Poetry is not a natural mode of expression nor an easy one . Many students will therefore balk at storming its citadel . But they might more readily be lured into it by demonstrating to them the relative simplicity of the humor-forms . The catchy 3-3-2-2-3 rhythm of the limerick is picked up with no trouble at all . I experimented with limericks and found that even the very dullest pupils could supply good last lines . They not only had a hilarious time but they also had wonderful exercise in handling language . There was a young man from Peru Who never knew what to do ; Ile went for a ride With his girl beside And simply neglected to woo . This is an example of what an average student can do after one lesson . The alternating iambic tetrameter and trimeter of the ballad-form is another rhythm which is swiftly and painlessly mastered . The following was composed in ten minutes : // A SAD , SAD TALE He was a Standish sort of guy , ( Which does n't stand for much ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls and such . He met his Prissy and fell in love , For she was wondrous fair ; She wanted him to tell her so , But this he did n't dare . For fifteen years he called on her , But never did propose ; Until one day she ups and weds Another man she knows . And now , most sorrowful of sights ! With broken heart he sits , And mourns with many a heartfelt sigh The krieg which did n't blitz . Undoubtedly the most difficult form of writing is drama . Everything ? description , action , philosophy ? has to be carried by dialogue alone . But the skit is a comparatively simple thing to produce . And work on the short comic sketch is an admirable preparation for more ambitious dramatic writing . Another consideration in the preference of humor as an instrument of literary apprenticeship is the ubiquity of its source material . Everything in the world which appears not as it should is incongruous and therefore lends itself to humorous treatment . They say that available plots are few . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always close at hand . Besides , the comic is perceptible to students of any age , race , or condition of servitude . Inasmuch as creative writing in the classroom should be a purely voluntary thing this becomes a doubly important factor . Humor is not only pleasant to work with but it is also one of the best , if not the best , means of developing expressive power . Good humorous writing demands a fine nicety of wording and unexcelled care in planning . It demands the author 's utmost from the viewpoint of the sheer mechanics of writing . Notice the precision and economy of phraseology in the following student selection : ODE TO A NEW YEAR 'S RESOLUTION TO FOREGO WINE , WOMEN AND SONG No women , wine and song , for me , I swear it by the moon ! But still it would n't hurt to sing Just ? just a little tune . And wine , that evil grape ? Begone ! And yet a man gets dry . No thanks . You say it 's muscatel ? I guess I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line . Of them I am not fond . I 'm staying clear of them , I am ? Did you say she 's a blonde ? The more advanced students may be put to work on the fascinating business of parody . It is , alas , a common HUMOR AND THE CREATIVE SPIRIT III practice among teachers of English to have their pupils learn to write by imitating models . The idea is that the neophytes will see how the masters do it and will learn to toss off masterpieces by the mere force of excellent example . But this method is stupid because it defeats its own purpose . It produces two possible evil results . Either the student copies slavishly , in which case there is nothing creative about it and the work becomes dull and barren , or he does try to compose his own , and finding that he is no Wordsworth , he becomes discouraged . Improving style by profiting from the example of the great artists is all very good if it is done intelligently . And intelligent is the word for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still creative writing . It requires the same language skill that any other kind of humorous writing does . Furthermore , parody to be successful presupposes a thorough knowledge of the original . That humor is a significant influence in the exercise of creative English can hardly be doubted . But the creative spirit is practically not limited to the English class . It belongs properly in social sciences , mathematics , natural sciences , foreign languages , music , art , commercial studies ? indeed , every school subject . And everywhere mirth has an important and legitimate place . Laughter is a tremendous stimulant to the creative spirit in after-school years . Someone once defined genius as the ability to work with joy , the habit of regarding labor as play . Certainly every great creative artist ac112 LAUGH AND LEARN quires his expressive power only after an arduous training period which would be heartbreaking to anyone who could find it anything but pleasant . He is the master craftsman who laughs and sings at his work . Unfortunately most people work with something less than joy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may earn a livelihood , Their jobs become dull , routine affairs demanding nothing but time and sweat . They spend their lifetime schooling themselves to fulfill their duties with the least possible expenditure of energy . This they euphemistically call efficiency . The only happiness involved is at closing time or in receiving increased remuneration so that they may better enjoy their hours away from work . And this description , 0 sad to relate , fits the vast majority of teachers . But there is nothing creative in all of this . To create is to love . And with that which we love we take unstinting pains and reckon not the cost . On the contrary , it is our pleasure to be lavish . Only those who have something to give , the really rich , can afford such lavishness . Only the toolmaker or the musician or the teacher who finds amusement in his work can become an artist and a contributor to his art . In the normal or average social life of both children and adults the spirit of play is the chief , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their games " make believe . " They use their imaginations in playing " house " or making rainbows of crushed stones // or in devising new amusements and practical jokes . Grown-ups do the same in many of their parlor games such as charades . For the sake of inducing joviality people , who of their own accord would n't display enough initiative to attempt a cross-word puzzle , will eagerly throw themselves into the task of preparing skits , variety shows , quiz contests and similar pastimes . And in the golden shower of their mirth the fact that they have been working hard is entirely lost upon them . Laughter is a wondrously effective instrument of creative control . It is the art corrective par excellence . When a story , for example , becomes overmushy it excites laughter rather than the emotion intended . And the author is seriously hurt . But if the writer 's sense of humor is sufficiently developed he could laugh at his own maudlinity and his unhappy story would never face an audience . Mirth is a check to the temptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a little laughter . A couple of years ago I reviewed a volume of poems by someone from the horribly British Isles named Ann Lyon . Two terrible things happened to Miss Lyon first she lost a beloved brother and secondly she decided to write a book about it . The pathos was so unrelieved and so violently overdone that instead of being Its mpathetic I became poisonously witty about the whole affair . And I am a very tolerant man . Exaggerated passions , love and hate , are always ridicu114 LAUGH AND LEARN lous . Laughter begins at the precise moment it is felt that the warmth of passionate utterance is not called for by circumstances . And the more earnestly the artist pursues his unwarranted Sturm and Drang , the more screamingly funny the whole performance becomes . Such artistic botchery is possible only to him with a deplorable lack of a sense of humor . Just as comic as flatulent emotions are intellectual boners . The movie director who shoots an eighteenthcentury scene with somebody using an electric shaver will be so triumphantly hooted down that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Laughter is a corrective to bad art from a purely mechanical standpoint as well . Clumsiness is in itself comic whether it be found in bodily movement or in the graphic execution of a pastoral landscape . A person who sees his brainchild ridiculed because of awkward construction will either work his hair off to improve his technique or quit altogether . It is not enough to want to create . One must also know how . And this knowing how is much sooner and more economically learned by him who can laugh at his own mistakes . // DEAR TO THE HEART of the ultramodern pedagogue is is the cooperative project . What is this ancient thing which is called the newest of educational wrinkles ? We have already described a cooperative project in selfgovernment . There is the research project in which a group of students or the entire class makes a concerted study of a particular unit of learning , the results of which become the property of all . It maybe bibliographical . Herein a division is made of the task of delving into all references @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egyptian Flea . Written or oral reports are made to the whole group and all the material is assembled , evaluated and organized . The research may be an observational trip wherein the civics class , for example , goes en masse to find out how many homes in the tenth precinct have no garbage cans . Or it may be experimental , the pupils sharing the findings of their laboratory experiences . A time limit is specified for each successive project , although this may be more or less elastic . In sumo places all this is called the unit system of study . Even more interesting is the creative project . In this the students pool their resources and create their own materials of learning . They learn by doing . 115 // In many schools the cooperative project has largely supplanted the traditional method of daily assignment and individual classroom recitation . Why ? What arc the advantages ? First of all the students learn to work together instead of knifing each other . They see how much can be accomplished by cooperation and mutual aid . Group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand their private responsibility to society , the interdependence of man . If one individual fails in his job everyone suffers . And the pupils , with the merciless forthrightness of youth , will let the sinner know dramatically and conclusively that the way of the parasite is not as pleasant as it would seem to be . Thirdly , the cooperative project evokes more efficient learning because it demands the active participation of the class members . It is something which must be done , not something to which one may or may not listen . Fourthly , the results of the work are tangible . They may be kept and shown to others . This can not help but stimulate community pride in the classroom labors . And pride in work is an essential to good work . These are but a few of the advantages . It is plain to be seen that the cooperative project not only induces more of fective learning , but that it is also the finest kind of social and moral training . But it can be overdone and perverted . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be practised in moderation , even virtue . " A patient dies just as easily from an overdose of medicine as from the disease itself . // ' There are teachers who are much too serious about their progressive education . They speak loftily of creative methods and regard them as dogma . They try to make he student fit the program instead of vice-versa and they fail utterly to see that they have fallen into the same error of inflexibility that characterizes the diehard fundamentalist . The cooperative project is splendid pedagogy . But not every situation calls for it and not every student is ready for it . And where it is slapped down from above and rigidly conducted it becomes as onerous and unloved as any oldstyle homework ever was . Schooling of any kind should be a joyous experience . If it is n't , the optimum learning wo n't take place whether the instrument of torture be called essentialist or progressive . If overearnest teachers remembered this simple principle they would be saved from many a needless and costly mistake . Working on a creative project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rising element is missing and the outcome is flat . One of the things that can be said for the cooperative project is that it lends itself to spontaneous gaiety . The whip of individual calling-to-account is removed . So is the pressure of competition according to unnatural standards . The Work is at least overtly voluntary . The student is therefore relaxed and can fall easily into good-natured merriment . // Any project may be presented as a game , and the spirit of play is too valuable a driving force to overlook . Once the student gets the impression that making things is fun there will be no holding him back . He 'll work like a demon and pant at the privilege of being party to the undertaking . All the teacher has to do is to show a little enthusiasm and everything else will take care of itself . Humor is the oil and the amalgam in the building of cooperative projects . The cathedral is not erected without heartache . Stones will fall and plans will go awry . There are bound to be rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertaking . But a jest at the right time will rescue the job from collapse . In laughter disappointment and vexation vanish and the flagging spirit is rejuvenated . Disagreement and bickering are common wherever there is collaboration . Even so wonderful a team as Gilbert and Sullivan quarreled and split . There is a difference of opinion , for instance , on how the cover of the class magazine should be lettered . One section of the group argues with point that script is the most graceful . Another section maintains with equal justification that block letters are simpler and stronger . Each side is insistent and the result is a friction which might easily become serious . Even if the matter is decided democratically by majority vote , there are likely to be a few members of the minority who would be stubborn and piqued by defeat . This is when humor is // needed . Mirth draws co-workers together and minimizes their differences . Compromise is not difficult where there is levity . And jolly people are not too much concerned with enforcing their way . When something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide the joke which will set hilarity off if the students have not done so themselves . But laughter is more than a lubricant ; it is an igniting fuel . Out of a humorous remark , a funny incident , or a jocund mood the idea of the communal endeavor may spring . We say that the work should be pursued in the spirit of jollity . Good . But the prevailing attitude is determined largely by the character of the initial impetus . Let this be a guiding principle to progressive teachers : Every creative project must start in laughter . A mirthful beginning makes immensely brighter the chances for a mirthful end . Inevitably there must be restraining criticism by the teacher . Students in their discussions and plans will go off on irrelevant tangents . They must be brought back to the main path . Furthermore , they tend to overestimate their own ability and they will blithely attempt difficult jobs which are almost certain to end in fiasco . Therefore they must be gently led into something their own size . Even as their teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reasoning . These must be corrected . But the flush of their creative enthusiasm can be ( tilled to death by adverse criticism , however right . The // wise teacher , then , hesitates to toss the wet blanket . of his conservatism upon their youthful ardor . He must avoid injuring their feelings and shaking their selfconfidence . Guidance has to be given , though , and it is best given in jest . If you tell someone he is doing his job wrongly and joke about it in such a way as to arouse good-natured laughter , the sting of rebuke is gone and the instruction gets across . This is a good thing to remember not only as regards cooperative projects but also in respect to any kind of classroom work . What are some of the specific creative projects in the English course , for example , which have proved themselves feasible at the secondary level ? A very popular one is the class newspaper or magazine . This appears at regular intervals , say every month or six weeks , and is edited and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor merely checks up to see that instances of bad taste are eliminated . The publication may be either general or according to a special plan . An illustration of the latter was a magazine put out by a class of mine which had been studying the Sir Roger de Coverley Papers . The group decided to produce its own Spectator Papers , for which a character , one Percy Pipsqueak , was invented . Percy was a student of our school and he wrote about timely topics of undergraduate concern a la Addison-Steele . The students had a merry time of it and brought forth an issue creditable enough to earn top mention at a state convention . // Humor is the bread-and-meat of the class newspaper . It is not only present as a working condition but it occupies the great majority of the printed matter . Below are a few examples taken from a representative volume. * UNPROFITABLE THRILL I was sitting in my classroom Not thinking of a thing , When all at once he entered , And oh ! my heart did sing . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front ; I just could hear him saying , " Oh gosh , who is that runt ? " His gait was long and stately , And as he passed my seat , He was a mess o ' cuteness , From his head down to his feet . Before he reached the teacher , My thoughts to him did stray , A question was then asked and yes , I would be called that day ! When all excited and off guard , I started to recite , O gee , I guess you 've got me ? With an " F " she said , " All right . " Well when he left and as the door Shut tightly from behind , I fast returned to dreaming With that cuteness on my mind . // MY GIRL My girl is like a lovely poem , Her lines are very good ; I read her as I would a book ? Anybody could ! Her eyes are like two twinkling stars , Like roses red her cheeks ; Her luscious , soft and silken hair , Has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun , Her skin you love to touch ; She 's really very kind and sweet And never asks for ? much . My girl friend is a dream alive , A perfect mate for some . I too could fall for her if only She were not so dumb ! CINQUAIN The Careful Driver turned to see The sign marked , " School zone ? Slow " And ran his auto up a tree ; Which only goes to show That you never can tell . AM I THE ONLY ONE ? Dear , when you held me in your arms And called me sugar bun , Now this is what I want to know : Am I the only one ? // You said I was a flower , That you would be my sun ; But there are lots of flowers ; Am I the only one ? Now when you held me in your arms , ' T was then my life had begun . So tell the truth and do not lie , Am I the only one ? TONY PETE Tony Pete ai n't very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , And when it comes to money , It 's always IOU 's . He eats just like a pig I think , Head down and bottoms up , And never seems to bother much To drink it from a cup . His clothes is kinda femi-nine , Tight fittin ' at the waist ; His complexion like a porcupine , Mixed with sugar paste . And boy , 0 what a kisser his ! A mouth from ear to ear , A nose just like a dipper-dupper , He 's certainly a dear . How I just love to hug him , My great big darling cluck ; You see ? us two is married , So now you know , I 'm stuck . // MEASLES Measles : common disease infecting children between the ages of two and seven years , ? so I , not a day under fourteen , got the measles . One morning about two weeks ago ( I do n't really remember correctly . It 's been so long since I 've touched anything that belongs to me besides me blankets ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per usual the project did n't exactly appeal to me , so I sez to my ma , " Hey , ma , I ai n't feeling so good . Maybe I got a temperature . " Well , ma is a sucker for things like pig in the poke and temperance societies . She especially delights in people who have abnormal temperatures . Rita abnormal ! So she hauls out our faithful but battered family thermometer ( most of the time my kid sister uses it for her doll ) , and sez , " Here , stick this in your pan and keep your mouth shut ' cause your father is letting up the heat . " So being a good-natured person like I am , I does it . And my kid sister is standing there with a grin a mile wide ( sometimes I think she delights in the morbid ) , and my mother is standing there smiling her crooked , apologetic smile , and my father is down the cellar letting up the heat , and I 'm just standing there with a thermometer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother sez , " Thermometers , they 're wonderful ! " You 're only supposed to wait three minutes but the kitchen dock is slow . Well , five minutes later I takes the thermometer out of me puss and my mother read it ? pardon , she tried to read it . She took it over to the light , turned it upside down , took a deep breath and looked again . Suddenly she ran out of the room screaming red murder . " Murray , " she yelled ( that 's my father I think , I hope ) . He was down in the cellar not letting the heat up but reading last Sunday 's funnies at the foot of the cellar stairs . " Murray , Murray , Rita 's // got 108 ? , she 's got 1081/2 . Oooh ! " She tripped over my lather who , as I said , was reading last Sunday 's funnies at the foot of the cellar steps . Now my father is not the excitable type . I once came home with an A in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just took it calm-like . Well , sir , he just picked my mother up , folded the funnies the way he had found them ( I forgot to tell you that my father is neat , neat to the point of exasperation . He 's always exasperated because I do n't take after him in that respect ) , and said , " Rita 's got what ? " Mother had n't recovered yet and she just upped and started to bawl . " She 's going to die , " mother cried hysterically , " she 's going to die ! " " Who 's going to die ? " my father demanded patiently . lie was used to this sort of thing . " Rita is , " sobbed my maternal parent . " She 's got 1081/2 . " " Do you mean fever ? " queried my pop . " Yes , " screamed my mother at the top of her lungs . My daddy grabbed the thermometer and read it and shook his head . He was visibly trying to control his temper , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot of the cellar steps sobbing like her heart was abreakin ' and just crumpling those funnies right back into their native woodpulp . Ile walked over to her and with compassion in his expression picked up the remainder of the comics . Then he patted her on the shoulder and said , " It 's all right , clear , she 's only got 103 . " The two of them walked up the cellar stairs together , mother blubbering into father 's once immaculate handkerchief which before using , she had protested that it was so much trouble to do up on account of it had an initial and all . ( Father nearly threw it at her . ) When they arrived upstairs mother proceeded to dope me with aspirin , milk of magnesia and hot lemonade . After // that she called the doctor who told her to give me aspirin , milk of magnesia and hot lemonade . My ma said to my pa , " Good doctor , Sam Roth . He knows his stuff . " Poor father had quite a struggle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Then my sister was all sympathy . She stayed with nie all day and bothered me . The cute thing just lay at my feet and sucked her thumb . Every time I got half way through a paragraph in a book she would pull it out of my hands and say ominously , " Remember , Rita , I 'm keeping you company . " ( The little darling ! ) Two days later ? ah , two days of lying in bed with nothing wrong with you ( bed , it 's wonderful ) ? my complexion , I notices , is following the spring fashion trend , RED . Two hours later I was telling my darling sister ominously , " Remember , Poochie , you kept me company . " Mother called the doctor again . This time he came to the house . He took one look at me and said , " Pull down the shades and do n't give her anything to eat . Three dollars please . " Now my mater is definitely the naive type . She hands over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that father had forbidden to the house . ( I do n't know why except that he liked mother an awful lot . ) Well , this doctor , as is the custom of most men in the medical profession except my Uncle Sam , examined me and very nicely told my mother to pull down the shades , to keep me on a liquid diet , my sister out of the room , everything disinfected and would she kindly give him five dollars . Mother appreciated that and simply ignored father who glowered at everything in sight . Father did a lot of swearing after that as mother was too busy with me to pay much attention to him . The only trouble was that I was on a liquid diet . It really is a crime to curb a healthy adolescent appetite . Imagine having to drink grapefruit juice when the // rest of the family was having steak and French fries . And canned grapefruit juice at that ! Mother complained that grapefruits were too high . After my first look in the mirror I did n't bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leper gloat over his sores ? No . Does a person with chickenpox scratch ? Definitely . So did I. Only I had the measles . At my age I should get something to make me look glamorous and white and strained and suffering . But no , I have to go and get the measles and look like a pineapple swathed in red dotted swiss . My darling sister drew pictures of me with great blobs of red crayon all over my face , and my father listened to the news at my bedside . ( Why Herr Hitler had to invade Norway when I had the measles I do n't know . It rankles deep along with the time Allen took Arleen to the prom . Anyway I wore my white angora bolero as a bedjacket , and the only person I could make jealous was Esther , who always liked it anyway . And what chance did I have of ensnaring some Young Casanova , even with my white angora bolero , when I looked as though some two-hundred pounder had sat on my face with a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Friday and mother is just bringing me a lass of lukewarm pineapple juice and inquiring , " Are volt cold , dear ? When did I give you your aspirin last ? Now was n't that good ? " ( She knows I detest that slop . ) Poor mother , she suffered more than I did . She could n't even play mah-jongg for two weeks . Father did n't mind that . Now to tell you the truth , I do n't know how I got the measles . However , I do know how I got the temperatitre ( there are ways when you do n't feel like dusting your room or going to school ) . Monday morning I was all ready to go to school , much to my sorrow , when my mother runs into the living room like a three-alarm lire . " Where is daddy ? " she managed to gasp . He was // down the cellar letting up the heat . So I told her that , so mother turns around on one heel and heads for the cellar where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's funnies at the foot of the cellar stairs . " Murray , " she yells , " Murray , Poochie has 1071/2 ! " ( Poochie is my sister . We call our dog Alice . ) As I said before , my father is a very remarkable man and that was the first time I ever saw him lose his temper . Poor mother . Poor father . Poor Poochie . Ah .. . I do n't have to go to school for another two weeks ! Nyaaah . DIARY OF A DOG These are excerpts taken from the diary of Duchess , a canine beauty .

Such things as form , theme , setting , emotional tone , title , characters and bare outline of plot are determined by the class as a whole in open forum . A group , composed preferably of volunteers , is delegated to do whatever research is necessary . The best writers meet in small committees and produce the dialogue scene by scene . A third group , comprising the remainder of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the play is completed it should , wherever possible , be performed . Casting , direction and staging should be in the hands of the students themselves . At least one rehearsal should be held during class time . When the play is given those who do not participate in the performance as either an actor or a stagehand assume the role of dramatic critics . Throughout all this the teacher does no more than advise and encourage . By far the best kind of play to create in the above manner is the comedy . Tragedy is too difficult . Melo drama , demanding ingenious plotting , does n't lend itself readily to the methods of mass art . The comic mood is // much more easily sustained over a long period than any of her . Furthermore , a serious play that is not well done becomes ridiculous . Comedy is easier and safer . Behides , creating fun is fun . A tenth-year class of mine decided to write a oneact : comedy on high-school dramatics . The setting was to be an after school rehearsal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested innocently enough to hide my Machiavellian design that they noose a scene from Shakespeare , inasmuch as we were currently studying the Bard . They snapped at the bait . Accordingly the research group went to work and read every one of Shakespeare 's plays ! ( Teachers who find it hard to get their students to read even the two or three required ones , take heed . ) The scene finally selected was from The Taming of the Shrew . All in all the students had a hilarious time and they learned their I Tama more thoroughly than any other 10-B group . The intelligent remarks of the student critics ? " part spoiled by overacting . . . action placed too far upstage . . . climax not adequately prepared " ? proved it . A fine full-term project is the collection of original Skits , stories , poems , or essays . The compilation is put into the form of an artistic book and it remains as a permanent record of the group 's activities for the semester . As in the other projects the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes made a book of Short dramatic pieces called " Skits ' n ' Sketches " in // which everyone was represented . Here is a sample of the contents : WHEN MA COMES HOME Si : I am waiting patiently . Waitin ' for seven o'clock to come . Hi : Why ? Si : ' Cause when my ma comes home , 0 boy ! Hi : So if she comes home , so what ? Si : Guess you wonder what I mean . All right , I 'll tell you . Hi : Well , do n't be so slow about it . Si : When my ma starts cooking she sure can strut her stuff . Hi : Oh , now I get it . We 're gon na eat . Si : Now that old oven 's good and hot . I hope ma is n't late . Hi : Me too . Si : For I sure feel hungry and I do n't like to wait . Hi : Now you 're talking . Si : Wan na know what we 're gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should I ? I 'm crazy about good cooking . Si : We 're gon na have ham and eggs and some good old cracklin ' bread . Hi : Sure sounds good . Si : We 'll have sweet potato pies , a half dozen or so . Hi : Yum . Yum . Si : Now it ai n't no use smackin ' your lips ' cause I ai n't gon na tell you no more . Hi : Now listen . . . Si : But I do n't blame you . I heard your lips go smack . I saw your eyes roll around . But them there pies would make a preacher lay his Bible down . Hi : We 're still friends , ai n't we ? // Si : You wan na know what else we 'll have ? Everything nia cooks is good . is Do n't talk too much . I just ca n't wait . Si : You want me to invite you over ? Gee , I sure wish I could ! A fourth type of project I have tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harried resort to every device I knew I apparently could not interest one slow class in Scott 's Ivanhoe . Nothing seemed to work until I suggested that Ivanhoe would make a great motion picture . It had all the elements ? love , adventure , suspense , comedy , spectacular lames and a happy ending . I added that it might be ( tin to see if we could adapt the novel to the screen . ' ( he students were immediately up in their seats . They thought it was a marvelous idea . One boy brought in an actual scenario of the picture , " Union Pacific , " I believe , which had belonged to some Hollywood star and this was passed around among the awe-stricken class members for inspection . For the next two weeks we were happily engaged in sketching out scenes movieland fashion . The pupils were especially amused the day we chose our cast from a distinguished list of Cinematic celebrities . There were differences of opinion , of course , and in order to support his choice each student-would refer triumphantly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To them it was all a game . But in playing that game they did a remarkable job of learning Ivanhoe. // The exhibit is an old but still very useful project . 11 consists of material illustrating the work of the course , or any phase of it , and is artistically arranged in any kind of edifice from a notebook to an elaborate show case . The exhibit is valuable because it enlists the services of everyone , and if the students are permitted to duo their own building it is apt to be a mirthful experience . A sixth type of creative project which is acquiring increasing favor is the entertainment program , the " show . " Of this there are a great many varieties ? skits , quiz contests , song-and-dance numbers , recitations , trueexperience , embarrassing-moments , believe-it-or-not and other kinds of anecdote programs , tall-story round robins , and so on . That humor and laughter are the main stuff of these classroom shows is too obvious to bear exposition . Also worthy of mention is the special-occasion project . A week before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a rollicking , chummy thing to do to write a batch of yuletide poems and inscribe a different one on the blackboard of every room in the school . At Christmas Eve student tours were conducted from room to room to see these minor masterpieces . A repro ? sentative verse was the following : If you 've been cutting classes , kid , And failed to do your work ; If you have been a problem child And your duty oft did shirk ; // If you 've been coming late to class And snitch and cheat and lie , You 're S.O.L. , my foolish friend , For old Santa 'll pass you by . He 'll pass you by with nary a nod , But do n't be grieved or sad ; For even if St. Nick falls through , You can always count on dad . School journalism without humor would be a sorry thing indeed . The comic sections of the newspaper or magazine are first turned to and are most eagerly read . As faculty adviser to a school newspaper I know that humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stuff are as often as not ignored . Let us examine a typical four-page high-school newspaper . First , there is a humor column : I paint a tossing galleon on a dark wild sea , 11 I t ! 1 rosy tints of sunset scattered o'er the sky , And soaring high the waterfowls as homeward they fly , A picture such as only in nature we could see ?

IN OUR TIME The saddest words of tongue or pen Are these : " Can you lend me ten ? " Then there are three full columns of frivolous gossip . To the outside reader this may not seem very comical , // but to the students who know the individuals involved , it is excruciatingly funny .

Short columns are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty I 'm not a great star . Others are handsomer far ; But my face ?

Tommy : No , teacher , I got it wrong all by myself . Furthermore , the issue carries funny poems like : ODE TO A MONTHLY TEST Blessings on thee , little test , Major cause for a month 's unrest ; Making every student quail , And a goodly number fail ; Bringing smiles of great delight To him who gets the answers right . Cruel announcer of my fate , Saying I wo n't graduate ; Victim of my teacher 's mind , Give me not this cut unkind !

Add the cartoon and the following rib-tickling essay and the list of humor is complete . PRINCE HAMLET ? THE MELANCHOLY DANE ( This story is completely my own ; any similarity to any other composition is purely coincidental ) Prince Hamlet , the young heir to the Danish throne , was a dark horse who had spent his wakeless moments in prancing about with nightmares . Born into a royal family aflame with discord , the growing prince had consistently enacted the role of the retiring lad in royal flush . His mother was a scheming woman who had one clay married the old man , simply on a royalty basis , and had dedicated the next day , and the years thereafter , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to construe tonsillitis as a legal ground for she " had n't another thing " on the old gentleman . Failing in her attempt at legislation and fretting at the drab bleakness of the castle , the Queen , as a means toward a better end , had advertised for a hoarder in order to break the dull monotony of a kingdom which had consisted of a melancholy prince , and a father who had precipitated this condition . Clipping the advertisement from a newspaper , and seeking priority by dint of kinHUMOR // ship , a brother of the King had entered his sealed bid and had had the same accepted . The King , as altruistic a gentleman as ever lived , had tendered his brother the unrestricted freedom of the castle and its servants , never suspecting that the latter had been in favor of usurping royal power to his own gain and profit . The Queen , having tired of being in bed with tonsillitis , had now begun to see in the King 's brother the exact image of Sir Lancelot . Little conversations had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to love meetings , the love meetings to glaring indiscretions , and finally , as an ultimate achievement , murder with malice aforethought . And so on Christmas Eve the consort of the Queen , disguised as Santa Claus , had pried into the royal bedroom and had given the King a sword with the season 's greetings . But in order to make certain that the instrument would n't go astray , he left it sticking in his Majesty 's stomach . The G-men , having been called into the case , had attributed the homicide to Kris Kringle , but upon heeding the pleas of thousands of children had , had now definitely decided upon a moody and morose career . Being rather aloof in his melancholy mood , the prince had learned to spend the greater part 4 his time on the roof of the castle where he talked with t I t e birds , the bees , that is to say the trees , and one or two mosquitoes . While so engaged on a rather torrid night there appeared before the eyes of Hamlet a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his father always preferred pajamas to nightgowns . With a twinkle in his eye , and an El Producto on his lip , the ghost spoke t I usly : " Go thou , my child , and have thy vengeance . It was thy uncle what did me dirt . " And the ghost said no more , for it had flown away even as the birds , and the // trees , that is to say the bees , and one or two mosquitoes . The remainder of the story is simple . From a plot laid in the hamlet of Copenhagen , haunted by the salty seas and the aroma of herring , had sprung a more animate Hamlet , a Hamlet inspired with an animal instinct in hounding his adversaries to their death . I speak of Prince Hamlet , the police dog . Although further included in the paper are all the news of the month , two editorials , various departmental notes , alumni notes , the honor roll , the book review section and creative writing of a more serious nature , approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor . School journalism , of course , is not strictly a classroom affair , but as an incentive to creative English work it must be taken into consideration . Youngsters , not unlike adults , are immensely thrilled at seeing their names in print . And I make it a point to encourage budding writers in my classes by publishing their most interesting efforts . Obviously humorous contributions stand the best chance of being accepted . // WE HAVE SAID in umpty different ways that laughter is good for students and that it profoundly helps to realize the main goals of education . Then by all means let us have laughter in the classroom ! That , concisely stated , is the message of this book . Simple , is n't it ? But at what , precisely do pupils laugh ? What is the shape , the color , the character of the student sense of humor ? How does it differ from that of adults ? What is there special about it , if anything ? Several theories of the basic cause of laughter have wen promulgated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are all substantially correct . The dissimilarities are merely t hose of emphasis . But whatever the fundamental source of humor is said to be , it has its purest manifestation in the laughter of youngsters because their risibility is more primitive , less fettered by the inhibitions of civilized refinements . They have had less time to develop false attitudes of gravity . The hardships and sufferings of the world have not yet had time to worry the soul into a ! ironic dourness . Let us take , for example , pleasant surprise or trivial disappointment ? the mind prepares for something big 141 // which turns out to be little ? as a cause of laughter . A good case can be made , and has been , for this being the parent root of all laughter through humor . If we should isolate as much as possible the element of surprise from other contingent mirth stimuli , however , the discrepancy between adult and child reaction to the comic becomes more pronounced . At the circus the trapeze artist arouses a reflexive anxiety in us lest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is n't going to do any such foolish thing the anxiety , unjustified , turns to laughter . Given a playful mood to begin with , there is nothing inherently funny in this situation other than the trifling disappointment . Now it is true that older people enjoy the circus , but what is their amusement compared to that of youngsters ? Children will laugh uproariously at clowns , animals , bareback riders and so forth where their elders will merely smile . A single visit to the Big Top would convince any careful observer that there is a tremendous quantitative difference and a subtle difference in quality between their laughter and that of adults . This is why students can howl with glee if I merely say , " Boo l " to them . Once when I was called to the door to listen to a highly entertaining discourse on the Serious Difficulties of Bringing Up Modern Young Girls by a visiting parent , some kind of a disturbance occurred in class . A tense hush fell over the room , however , as I returned sporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class grimly , I spoke with the most // menacing tones at my command , " As I was saying before the much deplored interruption , relative pronouns are pesky things . " This was followed by an instantaneous explosion of hilarity . Were it a group of adults there would have been a sigh of relief but little laughter . We speak of the humor of situation and of character . The former is the perception of incongruity and absurdity in relationships . The latter is the unwitting exposure of human foibles . Students are as keenly alive to these comic elements as grown-ups are , albeit on a less mature basis . Older minds find that most humorous which is a combination of several comic ingredients and which is swathed in a multitude of associations . The young person is more apt to laugh heartily at the simple , unadorned humor essence . Again let us illustrate . Anything that is recognized as incongruous or absurd is funny in itself . A man who is dressed and painted like an Indian and liberally besandwiched for advertising purposes appears incongruous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mirth . Adults will pass him by with hardly more than an amused glance . That youngsters react to the humor of character in its baldest form is shown by the delight with which they applaud sudden and dramatic references to the stinginess of the radio character of Jack Benny . A fundamental cause of laughter is a sudden feeling ( , f superiority upon seeing a weakness or trivial misfortune in others . In its most virulent form it is derision . // The " nationality jokes " ? Scotch thrift , Irish pugnacity , Jewish cupidity , Negro shiftlessness ? are the clearest examples of this kind of humor , and they are very dear to the hearts of adolescents , unless the latter happen to be Scotch , Irish , Jewish , Negro , etcetera . The absentminded professor , the victim of the hoax or prank , the man who makes a perfect three-point landing on his posterior after stepping on Junior 's roller skates all make us laugh . Not we but others have put themselves in ridiculous situations and so we can afford to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppressed desires is a primal cause of mirth . Certainly this is true of our vast body of obscene humor . It is true of irreverent jokes of all kinds . Afraid to express our real desires frontally , we sneak around and do it through the back door of jest . The young are every bit as quick to laughter of this inspiration as adults are . But the complexion differs . Matured people have a stronger sense of the censor . Amusement in naked lascivity , for instance , they feel is not a pleasant thing to admit even to themselves . The " good " individual , therefore , must needs clothe his leaking libido in something akin to wit . For the student this is far less necessary . He can take his " dirty jokes " raw ? and does . I have heard sweet little street urchins unaffectedly toss off language which would bring a becoming blush to the cheek of a Legionnaire . Surreptitiously nearly every student entertains a desire to knock the teacher off his sacred perch . And any disrespectful // reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galvanize that pupil into ribald merriment . The release principle can explain much of what we , in our superior wisdom , call silly laughter . ' The humor of expression ? creating fun through the lever exercise of our powers of articulation ? is generally more developed , to be sure , in educated adults . But high-school students are also capable of a high type Id expressive humor . Some of the work reproduced in t he preceding chapter is proof . Furthermore , the younger t h e child , the more prone is he to gurgle , cluck , bray , %% ( tinny , snort , burble , hoot , screech , and make other unseemly sounds solely for comic effect . This is the humor of expression in its simplest form . Geniality is a motive cause of laughter which modern psychologists have somehow tended to underestimate . Healthy people will fall into belly-shaking mirth through sheer animal spirits and nothing else . They feel expansive and joyous , all sunshine and no clouds , and so they laugh . And their laughter is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncommonly common knowledge that youngsters laugh oftener and harder because of good spirits than do adults . Children are more given to horseplay and active merrymaking . In their joyous mood everything is funny to them . No matter what happens they laugh . Whether the solution of a conundrum is correct or false it is equally amusing . The wiggling of a thumb sends them into paroxysms of mirth . And when the laughter // subsides through sheer physical fatigue , they begin anew through an automatic recollection of their hilarity . After such jollity in class I may ask , " What is so comical ? " And the gasping answer : " I do n't know . Ha , ha , ha , hee , haw ! But it 's funny . Ho , ho ! " The first general condition , then , of the students ' sense of humor is their more direct reaction to the basic comic elements in their barest form . The second is that their response to the comic is swifter . Much less so than their elders do they restrain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conventionality , pathos , worry , appropriateness , and so forth . This censorial middle process is weaker in them , and is more likely to be absent entirely . With the reins relaxed the horses of hilarity will leap forward the instant the humorous shot is fired . Paradoxically enough the student has a more inclusive sense of the comic . True it is that with maturation certain areas of humorous appreciation are widened and enriched . But on the other hand the number of things which can no longer be regarded with levity also increases , and at a faster rate of speed . Thus at one stage of life the child becomes aware of the fact that sticking pins into somebody is not funny . Later on he discovers that the message of his preacher is serious , not frivolous . Still later he finds that living with his wife , raising a family , or earning a livelihood is not a lark , but to a large extent , pretty grim business . When he finally be gins to see death as a dreaded reality instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke about the whole matter of life-and-death . Yes , Beethoven on his deathbed could say : Pdaudite , amici , contedia finita est. * But how many Beethovon 's are there ? Young children will laugh at anything which tickles them mentally irrespective of the object 's essential gravi t y or lack of it . Given the right kind of electrical combination they will laugh at papa , mama , the world and themselves . Many a dignified teacher is distressed by this , but he need not be . It is natural . Another thing to remember about the student 's sense of humor is his tremendous , seemingly insatiable , appetite for laughter. ** If it is not forthcoming gratuitously , he will go out of his way to seek merriment even if he Is not inclined to take pains with anything else . " Having good time " is important to him . And he will seize upon any occasion which promises him that . Even at high-school age he has developed little or no stomach or tragedy . Sentiment is just beginning to come into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning as such . The pupil 's predominant classroom appetite is for mirth . This is so large as to become characteristic of his intramural personality . He never tires of laughter and this for the educator has far-reaching implications . Looking at the student 's sense of humor from anher angle , we find that his laughter is for him a deeper // experience . He tends to project himself into the comic situation which has aroused his mirth . Vicariously he lives it through . In the earlier grades this tendency is more marked . Only rarely is the student capable of that detached amusement which many adults do acquire . Students , moreover , give vent to a heartier kind of mirth . More often do they " laugh all over , " the sides rocking , diaphragm heaving , face flushed . They will roar gleefully where the teacher will merely chuckle . Their language of risibility is more apt to be the bellylaugh than the smile . Their untamed , raucous " hawhaw " has not yet bowed fully to the ravages of culture . Students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infectious among older people as well , but not to the same extent . In every group of adults there is a sizeable minority who are unmoved by surrounding jocosity unless they themselves perceive something humorous . The type of person portrayed in the cinema by Ned Sparks , he of the perpetually solemn countenance ? more popularly the " sourpuss " ? is a rare phenomenon among schoolchildren . Let a girl start to giggle in class and in the space of a half-minute the others , almost without exception , will be slapping their sides in Homeric hilarity . The epidemic spreads geometrically . First two catch the laughing-bug from the original giggler , then four , then ten more , then the whole group . Important for the instructor to keep in mind is the fact that the student does n't have the same level of hu1II // tttorous appreciation he has . What we consider comic depends upon our apperceptive background , the sum total of our past experience . And the sense of humor changes qualitatively with our increasing experience . Thus the writer of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher and deucedly boring to the pupil . In a questionnaire given to 150 students I asked whether they thought the following passage was funny , and if so , what was funny about it : " I read for pleasure , mark you . In general I like wedding hells at the end of novels . They married and lived happily ever after ' ? why not ? It has been done . " This quotation tickled my sense of the comic both for its clever use of understatement and its release of many personal associations in regard to marital high  - -  jinks . But apparently both of these factors were lost on the students . Only two out of every fifteen considered the passage humorous , and even these advanced reasons other than those which caught my attention . It behooves the teacher , then , to study and understand his students ' sense of humor . If he does he will enjoy more success with his jokes . He will not often strain his wit for remarks which are over the head of his audience . Consequently he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pearls before swine . " Furthermore , comprehension of this sort makes him better prepared to utilize student laughter for the furtherance of his educative ends . // We have spoken of the student sense of humor in general terms . Let us examine it in some of its more specific aspects . In determining these I have supplemented observation and introspection with a series of question naires . The questionnaires provided for complete anonymity in order to insure honest answers . ' The findings pertain , of course , to students at the secondary school level , roughly between the ages of thirteen and eighteen . Student humor may be divided into two broad classifications ? conscious and unconscious . The unconscious humor , which is the student 's being funny when he does n't mean to be , has perhaps been overemphasized . Numerous collections of student boners have been made , The reason for this accent on innocence is that teachers and other adults tend to judge youthful humor by their own standards . Seldom do they find the pupils ' overt attempts at comedy comic , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first because of its palpable incongruity or absurdity , and secondly because it excites a sudden feeling of superiority in the spectator . There are many ramifications of unconscious humor . Perhaps the most common of occurrence is the misuse of words . Students like to experiment with new additions to their vocabularies and they do it with not always happy results . " Whenever I feel like doing anything , I do it . I 'm so repulsive . " A subtle distinction is made between the malapropism and the gobboism , both examples of incorrect usage of // big words . The malapropism is a product of pretension . The perpetrator tries to show off by employing a polysyllabic term which he has not yet learned to handle . A freshman boy of mine heard that " loquacious " meant " chattering . " And so in his next composition he wrote : " It was ten below zero and there I stood on the corner with my teeth loquacious . " The gobboism , however , is the result of sheer ignorance . " After climbing the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because the malapropism involves the humor of character as well as the other comic elements mentioned , it is much the funnier of the two . Similarity of key syllables is a frequent cause of wordperversions . " The Roman conqueror came back triumvirate , " or , " To protect the Indians the government has put them on reservoirs . " Somewhat of the same nature is the homonym error . Homonyms are groups of two , three , or four words which sound alike but which have different meanings and spellings , and they are often confused with devastatingly comic effects . A girl student wrote me a very lugubrious poem about hoping for " sweet death " to come and relieve her of her manifold miseries . She ends : How beautiful there To lie in death with no more pain , No trouble , nothing more to bare . " Poor audibility or indistinct enunciation is another source of word mistakes . That notorious boner : " The vitiator is a menagerie lion running around the earth , " // was made because the pupil did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jumbled visual memory also contributes a copious share of word errors . A girl wrote on a history test , " A trireme is a foreground with , etc . " The teacher in trying to trace the curious expression found in the book a picture of several craft , under which read , " A trireme is in the foreground . " A second type of boner is the grammatical one . The clearest example of this is the dangling participle ? " Walking up Market Street , the statue of Lincoln struck my eye " or " After playing baseball , the rain began to fall . " Pronominal solecisms also provide much unwitting humor ? " So I went to the store to buy it to make supper with . " Bad or insufficient punctuation sometimes makes for ridiculous utterance . Misspelling is a fertile field of hilarity . For example the following : " As I recall that day , a neighbor asked me to mine her little baby . " Errors of syntax , even if they do not expose a ludicrous twist , are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tendency to smile at the following paragraph of a practically illiterate student : I think Shakespear could of have a little more feeling and excitment in twelfth knight particullary at the beginning of each chapter he arouse my interest but at the end of the chapter I lost all of my Interest in the play as far as Julius Caesar goes . Shakespear is alright but when it comes to twelfth knight it is a total flop in opinion I might be wrong . Besides Shakespear do n't use perfect English . // False association of ideas is responsible for a huge percentage of student boners . The pupil receives several impressions or concepts and he does n't know how to combine them . Thus he writes : " A metaphor is a figure of speech like eight or sixteen . " Or another : " The constitution may be changed by a process called depression . " Related to this is illogicality of thought , the unintentional Irish bull . " The dead man was last seen walking toward the river . " Or this : " The perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double entendre presents a comical ambiguity of ideas , but is chiefly a problem of poor phraseology . Often the lack of clarity is due to faulty punctuation as in this sentence found in an extremely serious short story : " He came home to find his sister married with two young boys . " In the whole business of writing there is nothing funnier than an incoherent figure of speech . Students will be sedulously shown by their teachers the beautiful similes and metaphors of the masters . And in trying to imitate the figurative flights of these angels of letters the youngsters discover only after repeated fiasco that their wings are leaden . Their temerity is praiseworthy but their botcheries , sympathetic as we may be , are ridiculous . A girl once wrote a poem about me in which occurred this beautiful passage : " And oft he sits there by the window Sighing as he sees Nature Slowly floating by . " // Precocity is a contributing factor to much of the unconscious humor found in the schools . The child says something which is in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says it at his age , because he knows not whereof he speaks , the effect is immoderately comic . The bright sayings of infancy are the simplest and the most frequent illustrations . A Proud Parent bounds into the smoker and gurgles , " My Junior is so intelligent . Today he said Goo . ' " A seven-year-old farm boy had four older brothers who often " kidded " him about things , including the name of the family cow . He wrote a composition for his second-grade teacher which ran something like this : My name is E. ? R. ? . I am seven years old . I live on a farm . On the farm we have a dog . We also have a cow . The cow 's name is Bull 's Delight . The element of precocity is , of course , considerably less operative in high-school . But neither is it entirely absent . The sentence : " Milton wrote Paradise Lost ; then his wife died and he wrote Paradise Regained , " is funny enough when written by an adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even more mirth-provoking than precocious declaration is naivete . Typical of naive humor is the Little Audrey or Little Willie kind of joke . " When her mother told her to stay inside the shelter during air raids , Little Audrey laughed and laughed because she knew Italian balm was good for her hands . " Also : // Little Willie feeling happy , Swung a golf club at his pappy , Pappy ducked and maw said , " Four , " So Willie let him have three more . No discussion of unconscious humor would be complete without considering purely physical attributes . Some students simply look so funny that others laugh at them no matter what they do or say . The individual with popping or crossed eyes , with loving cup ears , or oversized nose has been given by nature a long headstart on the road to becoming a comedian . Many students have habitual , involuntary gestures which unfailingly draw laughs . One little colored girl stood up before the class and bravely tried to recite her piece above a terrific din of mirth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet from my desk and was proceeding systematically to rip it into tiny bits ! Speech defects , if they are not painful , are funny . Thus the occasional stammerer or lisper or adenoidal whiner will provide his fellows with some gratuitous merriment . Most comical of all vocal peccadilloes is the hanging voice . I remember coaching a student orator h r a commencement speech . There he stood on the stage of the auditorium solemnly addressing the assembly and doing admirably until at the climax of his talk his voice suddenly took a distressing leap into a fluty , oloratora soprano . It brought down the house . We have by no means exhausted the multi-angled subject of unintentional humor . Suffice it to say that it is extremely prevalent in every high-school classroom . // And that it brings with it delicate pedagogic problems . The natural reward of the boner is derision . Ridicule is a poison which corrodes the sensitive adolescent soul . True , the teacher can not stop the laughter , nor should he try , but he can take the sting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by emphasizing the humor of the situation rather than the stupidity of the student . Thus the mirth serves its corrective purpose and the pupil 's feelings are not hurt beyond a momentary chagrin . If the author of the boner continues to show signs of resentment or withdrawal , the instructor should relate a similar mistake , real or imaginary , which he had committed in his youth . Teacher in the same boat will sanctify any faux pas . It is in their conscious humor , however , that students are most interesting from an educational point of view . Their sense of humor as an instrument of personal growth is worth studying . Indeed , no teacher 's training is complete if he does n't know why and at what pupils laugh . Instructors are frequently disconcerted by a student 's suddenly laughing out loud with apparently no provocation whatsoever . As often as not this strange phenomenon is precipitated by a comical association . Someone says , " The house is painted green , " and at the last word the student begins to laugh because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plop into an open can of green paint . The humor of association is // just as common an experience among adults , of course , but they are better able to control themselves . The censorial middle process will prevent them from making themselves unduly conspicuous by outwardly causeless mirth , and so they are content to smile inwardly . Not so with many students . There is a quick nerve-impulse to laugh and they do . The thing to do when such an incident occurs in class is to look at the laughing student expectantly as if to invite him to explain what the joke is . But an explanation is never to be demanded . What seemed so funny to the individual pupil may sound very silly when told to others . If it does , the enforced narration results in deep humiliation . And this is brutal and unwarranted . Youngsters are much more keenly responsive to mechanical merrymaking and they participate in it much more actively than do adults . Horseplay , for instance , is a typical student activity . We have all seen it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , corridor tag , backslapping , juggling , tumbling , kinesthetic games of innumerable sorts . Horseplay is always accompanied by joyous laughter . It is a natural thing and to look askance at it is futile . Sometimes boisterous hilarity becomes destructive . A couple of boys will playfully throw their books at each other and break the bindings , or hurl them through a window pane . Horseplay is curbed not by prohibition ? that . is difficult to enforce and has bad psychological ef158 LAUGH AND LEARN fects if it is enforced ? but by fostering a sense of responsibility for school property and the rights of others . This may be done successfully by means of the democratic method . The idea that there is a time and a place for " fooling around " and that it is not always during the lesson , may also be put across in this manner . We do not begrudge children their high spirits . They will have time enough to be sedate and correct ? and dull . Slapstick comedy is a type of mechanical humor utterly characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pie-throwing epics of the screen . On a questionnaire given to a representative group of students 75% of them admitted that they always laughed when someone made funny faces , and the others answered , " Sometimes . " Broad farce is their meat . And they can always be reached through it . They not only appreciate slapstick ; they eagerly create it too . They clown around with the greatest of ease . They distort their faces , twist their bodies into ludicrous contortions and produce an infinite variety of suggestive noises . They are past masters at comic gesticulation . Disapproval , for example , they express by holding their noses and pulling an imaginary toilet chain . Crude , yes , but undeniably honest . They are inordinately fond of tricks and obvious jibes and loud talking and laughter . On trolley cars , in theatres , at the beach , in the school lunchroom they make public nuisances of themselves . And there is but one satisfactory way to remove the obnoxious feaTHE // tures of clowning by students and that is to offer them something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burlesque . There are two kinds of mischief , malicious and good-natured . Malicious mischief is antisocial and should be firmly squelched . Only to a perverted sense of humor is it funny . Good-natured mischief is of different caliber , however , and is quite prevalent in the highschools . The April Fool jokes are illustrative . A delegated student walks into class on April First and tells the teacher he is wanted in the office . If the teacher bites there is mirth uncontainable . In answer to a questionnaire 88% of the pupils thought that putting a tack on the teacher 's chair was funny . They pin " Kick me " signs on one another , adorn walls and sidewalks with private information of the " Johnny loves Mary " type , and put frogs in the girls ' desks . Their ingenuity in devising new practical jokes is inexhaustible . It may help only a few to say that mischief is a sign of childishness . The best method of curbing it is not to take undue umbrage at it . If the prank fails to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for being is gone . Student burlesque generally takes the form either of deliberate overplaying of a humorous situation in the mock-heroic manner or of jocund mimicry . Adolescents are as good at mimicking as adults and they are more apt to try it as a means of merrymaking . " Look , I 'm Hedy LaMarr , " says the incorrigible youth as he proceeds to give 16o LAUGH AND LLARN his own peculiar version of an animated cinema siren . Teachers are favorite subjects . A classroom audience will always laugh when " Old Battleaxe " or " Old Picklepuss " plays the boards . And the student mimes have an amazing faculty for picking out the very idiosyncrasies the instructor would least prefer having staged in public . If any high-school teacher imagines that his pupils do n't see through him , he 's crazy . And there is nothing he can do about it . The choicest performances are seldom given for his benefit . I once astonished an extracurricular class in dramatics by asking them to mimic me . The results were unusually stilted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and funnier . If the student penchant for burlesque is given a literary turn , namely parody , much can be accomplished ? We have already pointed out that parody is one excellent technique for learning to write . And students after a very few trials become surprisingly proficient at it . here is one : A PSALM OF LIFE ( with apologies to Longfellow ) Tell me not my morning glory , My wife is but a hideous dream . She 'd beat me senseless , leave me gory ; If she found me here with you she 'd steam . My wife is real ! My wife 's in earnest ! And my grave would be her goal . Dust am I unless thou returnest , So scram , my love , and save my soul .
