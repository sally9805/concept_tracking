txt It is the duty of Congress , we believe , to override the President 's veto of the new tax bill . Admittedly this measure is inadequate in the light of the needs of the present situation . It does not go far enough , and particularly it does not spread wide enough in its search for the additional revenues that are needed for the purpose both of financing the war and of siphoning off excess mass purchasing power which now threatens inflation . Nevertheless , the bill does promise , by the President 's own estimate , to bring something like a billion dollars annually into the Treasury , and Congressional estimates of its yield are considerably higher . The President 's veto message does not give good enough reasons to warrant the sacrifice of this additional revenue . Mr. Roosevelt reminds Congress that the Administration asked for a tax bill that would yield ten and a half billion dollars . On the basis of an estimated deficit of sixty billion dollars in the next Federal budget , the Administration was clearly right , as against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was wrong in the kind of taxes it advocated . It attempted to exploit still further the individual income and corporation taxes and refused to turn for supplementary revenues to the field of general consumption taxes . Secretary Morgenthau rightly declared : " We know where the bulk of the new money lies and where , therefore , lies the greatest danger of inflationary pressure . Today four-fifths of all the income of the nation is going to people earning less than $5,000 a year . " But the actual program he put forward bore little relation to this statement . The Administration favored types of taxes which would have endangered the nation 's productive processes themselves . If a sounder tax program had been presented to Congress , even with the larger revenues involved , it would doubtless have been received more hospitably . But no such program was forthcoming , and both Congress and the Administration , each yielding to the pressure of political considerations , must bear responsibility for a situation which , already bad enough , will become still worse if the present veto is sustained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note of the present widespread dissatisfaction over the complexity of Federal tax forms . He rightly says that this complexity is not the fault of the Treasury . If the forms are complex it is because the tax laws themselves are complex , and this is the fault of Congress . Fundamentally this is true . Yet the Administration 's own attitude has been one barrier to that simplification of the tax laws which the President again urges in his present message . For the argument made in Congress against absorption of the Victory tax in the regular income tax , which would be the logical way of beginning the work of simplification , is that repeal of the Victory tax would drop millions of taxpayers from the rolls just when there are the strongest possible reasons why they should be kept there . It would be a simple matter , of course , to prevent these present taxpayers from escaping taxes altogether by imposing , even at a low rate , a general sales tax . But against the imposition of such a tax the Administration has been adamant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
