At the turn of the century , it was an honor to pose for Sweden 's Anders Zorn . Among the sitters for Etcher Zorn , a mountainous , walrus-mustached fellow , were : William Howard Taft , Grover Cleveland , Auguste Rodin , Paul Verlaine . <P> Zorn 's female models were usually anonymous , but they became equally famous . He posed them by the sea or in bed - with snapshot casualness-and etched them in scratchy fishnets of sunlight or lamplight . Zorn 's shy nudes found their way into the portfolios of print connoisseurs , and still adorn the paneled shadows of many a club bar . <P> Last week 154 Zorn etchings ( the biggest show of his work ever ) hung in Chicago 's Lakeside Press Gallery . But Zorn 's claim to greatness , which still seemed assured when he died in 1920 , seemed a lot remoter now . Just one Chicago critic bothered to write up the show .
