While the Army has indicated what kind of a postwar military establishment it would like to have ( TIME , Nov. 20 ) , the Navy has kept a cautious silence . Last week a hint of Navy hopes came out . Navy Secretary Forrestal announced that a board of naval officers would try to figure out how a sizable portion of the 226,050 reserve officers now serving can be induced to stay on as professionals after the war . <P> The Navy expected to have such a whopping outfit that its 55,000 regular officers would not be nearly enough to go around . Part of the job of the 20-man board ( 13 of whom are reservists ) was to convince the best of the reserve officers that the Navy offered them a good future ; that they would not be handicapped be cause they were not Annapolis graduates . <P> On that score evidence already existed , especially in the air branch , that the Navy meant what it said . The Navy 's roster listed many a naval air reservist of captain 's rank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war were al ready respected flag officers : Rear Admiral George Henderson , Rear Admiral Alfred M. Pride . <P> So far few young reservists had shown any enthusiasm over staying in uniform after World War II . Navy officials hoped that they might still change their minds , banked on the fact that many a young reservist with no other specialized schooling than what he had had from the Navy would conclude that his best chance for the future lay in a naval career .
