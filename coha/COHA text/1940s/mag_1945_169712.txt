Labor got a sharp slap across the face last week . Andrew Jackson Higgins , New Orleans ' big , bluff shipbuilder , announced that he would close down his three plants , sell them to the highest bidder , and farm out his fat $40,000,000 peacetime contracts to other manufacturers . Reason : labor strife that never seemed to end . <P> " Then , " said Andy Higgins menacingly , " I 'm going to crusade . I 'm going to crusade to see that men who want to work can get it without paying tribute to any one . " Andy 's plants were already shut - by a strike . His labor troubles with 33 of A.F. of L. 's Metal Workers ' Unions were twelve months old . They were complicated by jurisdictional trouble with C.I.O. 's Marine and Shipbuilding Workers ' Union . Only a few hours before his shattering announcement , Andy Higgins had said he would sign a contract with whichever union won an NLRB election . ( Insiders said C.I.O. would have won . ) What had kept Andy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing that all returning servicemen must join the union . <P> During the war , because of his activity in behalf of Franklin Roosevelt 's reelection , Andy Higgins had earned a public reputation as a businessman New Dealer . He had helped organize the " Businessmen for Roosevelt " in the 1944 campaign . But Andy Higgins had always been a rough &; ready entrepreneur ; he damned bureaucrats of all kinds-Government and labor . <P> Some New Orleanians were somewhat skeptical of Andy 's move . They thought he might find some excuse to reopen later on . Andy sent a broadside to his sales force reminding them that while the Higgins company would be liquidated , Higgins himself was not .
