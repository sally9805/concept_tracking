Home has not been quite the same for the Arthur Roy Allisons of St. Louis since their daughter Elizabeth got married three years ago and went to live in Puerto Rico . Early last year , Mr. Allison hit on a great idea for keeping in touch with Elizabeth and her husband . He became a radio ham , **28;13890;TOOLONG , with a radiophone transmitter in the basement . In San Juan , P. R. , not far from Elizabeth , lived an active radio ham , Mrs. Jennie Ramirez , **28;13920;TOOLONG . She and Neighbor Elizabeth hit it off fine , and for most of last year they had gay radio gabfests almost every day with Allison , 2,500 miles away . Jennie introduced Arthur Allison around the ten-metre band .

Foxy Grampa wirelessed what encouragement he could , while the vast ham party line listened in sympathetically .
