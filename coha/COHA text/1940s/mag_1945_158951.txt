By last week , the number of U.S. polio cases had reached 5,207 . This was not nearly so bad as last year 's 7,792 , at the same date , but many U.S. areas , hard hit , were justly alarmed . A willing press spread the alarm even to areas having small cause for worry ( e.g. , Rhode Island , which has had no new cases recently ) . The worst spots : <P> Winnebago County , Illinois , which includes Rockford ( pop . 84,637 ) . The city , which has had 163 cases and 19 deaths , waited last week to find out whether a spraying with DDT ( TIME , Aug. 27 ) , does any good . New cases fell off a little . <P> Tennessee ( pop . 2,915,841 ) with 228 cases and Texas ( pop . 6,414,824 ) with 681 . <P> New Jersey ( pop . 4,160,165 ) with 519 cases and 43 deaths . To control the disease , Trenton and nearby towns have quarantined their children from school , church , swimming pools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Director of Health says carefully that New Jersey has no epidemic , but has proclaimed a " state of emergency " and asked the Red Cross for nurses , quick . <P> Just how polio spreads is still uncertain . But the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis advises against swimming in a fresh-water pool in a polio area . <P> If research will do the trick , polio has the best chance of all diseases to be stopped . Last week the Foundation announced that its 1945 March of Dimes netted $16,589,874 , a 50% increase over 1944 . This represents about $860 ( at last year 's high case rate ) for every polio case . Cancer , which kills around 170,000 persons a year , got about $4,000,000 this year in its one $5,000,000 public drive , only $23 per annual death .
