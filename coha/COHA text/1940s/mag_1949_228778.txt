Into the gilded ballroom of Manhattan 's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel last week trooped 3,000 members of the National Association of Manufacturers for their annual convention . <P> They were there to promote " New Strength for America " - their own confident combination of productive know-how , acre-straddling plants and free enterprise . But they also exhibited a sign of rare self-examination . They had invited as their guests 49 students , 32 college professors and school administrators from all over the U.S. From the younger generation N.A.M . hoped to get a new and fresh answer to the perennial question of N.A.M . and businessmen in general : How are we doing ? <P> A Ready Answer . In three days of speeches and group discussions there was plenty of doing . Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson had a few encouraging words for N.A.M . ' s consistent plea for economy in government . Said he : " The $15 billion budget of 1949-50 for our department will be reduced in 1950-51 to $13 billion . . . and our defenses will be appreciably improved . There will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taxpayer will get one dollar 's worth of defense out of every dollar spent . " From ECAdministrator Paul G. Hoffman there was another encouraging report : the cold war was about half won , he said . But , he cautioned , " it is the easiest half that lies behind us . " <P> Then Brookings Institution 's president , Dr. Harold G. Moulton , pointed up the responsibilities of businessmen and their government . <P> Said he : " Our future prosperity depends upon an intensification of technological progress . . . increasing productivity and a constantly broadening distribution of purchasing power by an ever-improving ratio of prices to wages i.e. , higher wages or lower prices . Unless the buying power of the masses , whose wants create markets , is progressively expanding , business will have to be content with a virtually static situation . " <P> As for government : " The American economy is not ... strong enough at present to carry the . . . mounting tax load . . . The continuance of fiscal uncertainty and instability will . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentives to take the risks essential to a dynamic , expanding economy . " <P> An Ambitious Program . To preserve incentives , N.A.M . wanted the U.S. to 1 ) abolish present excise taxes except on tobacco and liquor , and substitute a uniform manufacturer 's excise tax on all end products excluding foods ; 2 ) limit the 1951 budget to $33.6 billion ( some $11 billion below present estimates ) ; and 3 ) return to the gold standard . <P> To promote this ambitious program , N.A.M . followed its recent policy of picking a small businessman as president . Its choice : handsome , athletic Claude Adams Putnam , 59 , head of the 200-man Markem Machine Co. in Keene , N.H. , who succeeds Salt Lake City 's Paint-Maker Wallace F. Bennett in N.A.M . ' s top elective post . Putnam got his start in business at 16 as a machine-shop apprentice , and joined Markem when it was founded in 1911 . He soon became its top salesman , and in 1929 , its president . Proud that his non-union company has never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his employees as " the Markem gang , " refers to the plant 's janitor as " the man in charge of cleanliness facilities .
