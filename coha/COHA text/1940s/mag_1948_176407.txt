At the station break , the announcer said : " This is Boston , baseball capital of the country . " In his State Street office , a white-haired broker told his secretary that he would be in conference with his radio until the game was over . Attendance at Braves Field , home of Boston 's National League leaders , passed 1,305,000-breaking all records . Youngsters bivouacked outside Fenway Park all night to be sure of seeing the American League-leading Red Sox . From as far as Lima , Peru , requests for World Series tickets flooded in . Beantown , which has never had a series all its own , was suffering from double-pennant fever last week-and loving it . <P> Bostonians were not surprised to see the Red Sox leading their league . In Slugger Ted Williams ( batting .367 ) and other stars , the Sox had plenty of obvious talent . Manager Joe McCarthy , though new to the team this year ( TIME , Aug. 9 ) , had brought them along beautifully . But what really pleased Boston was the performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag since 1914 . What was the secret of the 1948 Braves ? Puzzled fans decided it must be the same factor that had put the Sox out in front , only more so -a manager . <P> Boy Martinet . Manager Billy Southworth had come a long way-up , down and up-since he was a Braves outfielder 27 years ago .

Three years later , Billy the Kid became manager of the Cards-and promptly got his nickname changed to Billy the Heel .

Under Southworth , the Cards won three consecutive pennants , two World Series . In 1945 , Billy left St. Louis for a fat offer from the " Three Steamshovels , " as Boston calls the rich contractors who own the Braves . The team jumped from sixth place to fourth , then to third last year . The delighted Steamshovels tore up Billy 's old contract , gave him an even fatter one ( his present salary : $50,000 ) . <P> Bunker Hill . Apart from Southworth , the Braves got most of their early-season drive from pepperpot Second Baseman Eddie Stanky , late of the Dodgers , almost a " playing coach " until he broke his ankle on a slide . It was Stanky who helped Rookie Shortstop Alvin Dark ( now batting .331 ) off to his sensational start . Even without Stanky , Billy 's boys picked up speed .
