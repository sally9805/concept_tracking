After being at war only six weeks , Brazil has found the formula that the U.S. has been seeking since Pearl Harbor-one man and one organization with the power to control and coordinate the tremendous upheaval of modern war . The man : Joao Alberto Lins e Barros . His title : Coordinator of Economic Mobilization . <P> Under powers stemming directly from President Getulio Vargas , Joao Alberto last week was made responsible for : 1 ) maximum production of industry , mining and agriculture ; 2 ) imports and exports of raw and manufactured materials ; 3 ) mobilization and utilization of labor ; 4 ) coordination of transportation , at home and on the seas ; 5 ) price fixing ; 6 ) distribution of commodities ; 7 ) arming and clothing of military forces ; 8 ) tightening of collaboration among federal , state , municipal , official , semiofficial and private organizations ; 9 ) fuel and food rationing . <P> Working with Coordinator Joao Alberto will be other Government ministers and the U.S. industrial mission of economists and technicians , headed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the surveying and planning of Brazil 's war program and its integration with that of the U.S. and the United Nations . The U.S. mission arrived in Rio de Janeiro last week , promptly visited the industrial city of Sao Paulo with Joao Alberto . Just as snappy was Joao Alberto 's ministry , which in one day converted barren offices in an eight-story building on the Rua Mexico into a den of typewriters chattering in the same key of confused urgency as those in Washington . <P> Tall , dreamy-eyed Joao Alberto has the craggy features of a scholarly lion . He has been head of Brazil 's Foreign Trade Council , Minister to Canada , a member of the Economic Committee of the League of Nations . He gained experience for his new position when , in 1939 , he was appointed president of the National Defense Commission to organize Brazilian industry . He has a son in the U.S. air force . He believes that " economics is a local science " and that Brazilian and U.S. experts must work out Brazilian problems in Brazil . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounced up the price of canned goods 20% to 30% ; nylon stockings to double their pre-war price ; rice , once 800 reis ( 4 ) per kilo , to three milreis ( 16 ) . <P> &gt; A currency shortage caused by inflation , hoarding , illegal withdrawal of " frozen " Axis funds and the sinking of the S.S. Texas , carrying currency engraved in the U.S. for the Brazilian Government . ( Last week an eight-day bank holiday was decreed to prevent a run on banks and tide over a temporary crisis . ) <P> &gt; Transportation , handicapped by submarine sinkings of ships at sea and fuel and power shortages . <P> &gt; Lack of chemicals and production machinery ( German pre-war specialties ) needed for armaments and new plants . ( Says Joao Alberto : " Ah , machine tools , that 's what we need more than anything . " )
