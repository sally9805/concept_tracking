A new and apparently successful treatment for infantile paralysis-reversing all accepted methods of treating the disease at its outset-was last week described to U.S. doctors . Instead of immobilizing paralyzed limbs by strapping them to splints , the new treatment calls for patiently flexing a victim 's useless limbs while he is still sick in bed . No doctor invented this method , but a nurse in the Australian bush named Sister Elizabeth Kenny. * <P> In the Journal of the American Medical Association , Drs . Wallace H. Cole and Miland Elbert Knapp of the University of Minnesota told how they invited strapping , soft-spoken Sister Kenny to work in Minneapolis hospitals . They reported observing and helping her in treating 20 patients within two weeks after the onset of the disease . Results within two months : <P> " Eleven have already been discharged completely normal . ... At least five of the others will recover completely within a reasonably short period of time . " <P> Sister Kenny places a patient flat on his back on a firm mattress which does not quite reach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with heels and toes stretching beyond the mattress , are set squarely against the footboard . Thus he exercises the muscular reflexes used for standing up . His arms are kept at his side , his knees straight . No splints or casts are used . Hot packs made of pieces of blanket wrung out of boiling water are laid on his paralyzed limbs . The packs are usually changed every two hours , every half hour in very serious cases . <P> Several times a day , Sister Kenny flexes the patient 's arm or leg " through the range of motion possible without pain . " As pain is reduced , the exercises are increased . By the time the first , contagious stage of the disease is over , all pain and stiffness are usually relieved . Treatment is continued twice a day until the patient finally learns to move again under his own power . <P> The doctors ' conclusion : <P> " The patients . . . were much more comfortable and cheerful during the acute stage than are those who are immobilized . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment . ... In most of them there is more flexibility than there was before the onset of the disease . " <P> * Miss Kenny is not a nun . In England and Australia , experienced graduate nurses are called Sister .
