txt WASHINGTON , May 14 ? A proposal that Congress by formal resolution request President Roosevelt to advise it on how to save a suggested $1,000,000,000 in nondefense appropriations was made in the House today , as Mr. Roosevelt sent up a request for $158,667,020 to expand greatly the work of the National Youth Administration . Representative Dirksen , Republican , of Illinois , a member of the Appropriations Committee , said he would offer a concurrent resolution requesting the President to say where savings of a billion dollars , a figure suggested by Secretary Morgenthau , could be made . Mr. Morgenthau , at the time Of his appearance before the ? Ways and Means Committee supporting a request for $3,500,000,000 in new taxes , had mentioned the NYA. , among the agencies which might be targets for drastic reductions in appropriations . Mr. Roosevelt 's request was largely for funds to train 2,978,000 additional skilled and semi-skilled workers for defense . New Work Training Proposed Congress was advised that the money was needed to train 360,000 workers in the next fiscal year at selected NYA training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to operate . on a threeshift basis to give more than 300,000 youths three months ' work experience . Mr. Roosevelt said that the money would also provide training for 900,000 workers in pre-employment courses and 950,000 in supplementary courses of less than college grade . This would require establishment of 20,000 training stations . The President said ' also that it was proposed to train 268,000 engineers , 10,000 chemists and to give vocational training to 500,000 farm youths . For reclassification of salaries in the National Labor Relations Board , the President asked $128,420 . The reclassification has been approved by the Civil Service Commission . The Ways and Means Committee , meanwhile , continued its hearings on the defense tax bill , hearing several witnesses including Dr. Irving Fisher of Yale University , who proposed that the Federal tax structure be revised to make spendings carry the entire load , so as to free great // BIG MA FUND ASKED AS CUTS ARE URGED // quantities of national income for productive investment . 5 Per Cent Levy Suggested Professor Fisher proposed a tax on individual spending , starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single person 's taxable income , and $10,000 on married couples . This would be in addition to the income taxes . He suggested that the tax be set up to apply to the portion of income spent , since all business expenses and investments as well as all taxes paid in the taxable year would be exempt from the spendings tax . His contention was that the present tax system , and the extension of it as proposed by the Treasury , was equivalent to " eating your seed corn instead of planting it . " As an example , he cited the case of Henry Ford , whose fortune mounted from a $1,000 blacksmith shop in 1900 to the $700,000,000 which he estimated Mr. Ford 's present fortune to be . Had the government taxed 100 per cent of Mr. Ford 's capital increase each year , Professor Fisher said , conceding that it was an " extreme " example , Mr. Ford would still have his $1,000 blacksmith shop and the government would have obtained forty times $400 , or a total of $16 , - 000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income tax each year and the possibility of leavying a Tinge tax at the manufacturer 's death . He said his idea was to encourage all Americans to invest a substantial portion of their earnings each year in business expansion and thus increase the entire national wealth . Tax on Bank Checks Scored The committee heard a protest against the proposal for a tax of two cents on each check drawn . It came from F. D. Scandling , representing the Institue of Bank Stationers , who contended that it would disrupt payment of debts , encourage employers to pay their payrolls in cash , and reduce the income of banks from the service charge on checks . Thomas P. Henry of Detroit , representing the American Automobile Association , without giving endorsement to any specific rates , approved the proposal made to the committee by Lecni.Henderson , Administrator of Price Control , and Marriner S. Eccles , chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , that taxes be imposed on durable consumer goods , such as automobiles . He called this preferable to a general increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tax on gasoline . " We recognize , " Mr. Henry said , " that we are confronted with a serious national emergency and that burdens must be shouldered by all to fulfill the obligations we have and are assuming . With this situation in mind , our executive committee decided to suspend , for the time being , our opposition to increases in the Federal automotive excise taxes . " In taking this position , we are not unmindful of the fact that when a new revenue bill was enacted last year for defense purposes there was a substantial increase in the automotive excise taxes . We are not unmindful of the fact that the current proposals are very drastic indeed from the standpoint of the new burdens that would be imposed ; that whichever of the alternatives advanced is adopted , the over-all result would be to more than double the weight of the automotive excise tax levies . " ' Aims of Program Endorsed The A. A. A. emphasized the fact that the Eccles-Henderson program , while designed to raise substantially the same amount of revenue as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeing of men and material for additional defense production , the prevention of inflationary price increases in goods limited in supply because of defense output , and the building of a shelf of demand to take up the slack in industry when defense activities have tapered off . The committee received a protest from William Steinberg of New York , president of the National Retail Liquor Package Stores Association , against the proposed increase ' in the tax on liquor . He said it would encourage bootlegging . Clinton M. Hester , counsel for the United States Brewers Association , told the committee that an additional tax on beer would tend to cripple the industry .
