Even the one-man lobby was startled by his success . J. J. ( for Jag jit ) Singh , president of the India League of America , got through Congress an amendment which will permit famine-stricken India ( pop . 389,000,000 ) to share in the largesse of the United Nations Relief &; Rehabilitation Administration . He had finally put through something that India 's timid official delegate had not even dared to bring up at UNRRA 's Atlantic City assemblage . <P> J. J. Singh , 46 , is a 6-ft , handsome Sikh from Kashmir , a confirmed bachelor , and a British subject . He came to the U.S. in 1926 to operate India 's concession at Philadelphia 's Sesquicentennial Exposition . He ended up too broke for passage home , stayed on , is now a successful , fluent New York importer . <P> He had never lobbied before . He knew few Congressmen . When he got to Washington , he discovered that the House Foreign Affairs Committee had already closed its hearings . But swarthy Jagjit Singh went to work . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , threw no Scotch- &-soda; parties in a plush hotel room . Instead he padded up &; down corridors of the Congressional office building , calling on members . He found them sympathetic , but unwilling to buck the U.S. State Department , the British Empire and UNRRA . He argued : India was chipping in $35 million to UNRRA , while millions of its own were starving . How could UNRRA move into India to feed the 750,000 Burmese refugees there , but not feed the hungry Indians alongside ? Finally Republican Karl Mundt of South Dakota offered a last-minute amendment to the UNRRA bill : " Any area important to the military operations of the United Nations which is stricken by famine or disease may be included in the benefits . " It breezed through . Then Singh moved over to the Senate . <P> Minor Statesman Tom Connally , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , gave him shrewd advice . No one had objected to the amendment , so why stir up a fuss ? Singh sat back , watched the UNRRA bill-with the Mundt amendment wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his amendment was only a " declaration of intent , " from but one of the 44 nations in UNRRA . But he also knew that the U.S. was the biggest spender in UNRRA . And U.S. officials might choose not to ignore the will of the U.S. taxpayer .
