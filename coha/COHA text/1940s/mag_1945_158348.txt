Newly democratic Guatemala 's university students went on a long-awaited rampage last week . Fourteen years ago Dictator Jorge Ubico had savagely suppressed their traditional Eastertide " Huelga Estudiantil " ( Students ' Strike ) ; now at last , in the liberal light of President Juan Jos Arvalo 's regime , it roared its way through the laugh-hungry city . Now there was at least twice the oldtime noise , fun , bawdiness . <P> Funds for the fiesta had been begged by students bearing chamber pots . They paid for scurrilous floats and costumes , and an unmerciful kidding that spared nobody , friend or foe . Some of the victims : <P> President Arvalo . His enemies had whispered that he was pro-Argentine because of his long exile in Argentina . So the " strike " featured Gaucho costumes . With a syrupy Argentine accent , a student representing the President wooed a girl named " Guayaba " ( tropical fruit , slang for the Presidency ) . When Guayaba hiked her skirts , she showed a label : " The Treasury . " President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Policy . Uncle Sam drove five Indians , representing the five Central American republics , across a stage . The Indians were loaded with shackles labeled " Bananas , " " Fixed coffee Prices , " " The Railroad . " Although the Great Good Neighbor cracked his whip , he cooed to the slaves : " I am your friend . " <P> The British . Guatemala 's new constitution claims Belize ( British Honduras ) . A banner cried : " Principles of the Atlantic Charter : to live without fear , want and Belize . "
