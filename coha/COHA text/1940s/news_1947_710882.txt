txt In envelopes of bills delivered by hand Maj. Gen. Bennett E. Meyers drew heavy profits surreptitiously for four years from his secretly controlled war contracting company , the Senate War Investigating Subcommittee was told today . B. H. Lamarre , the $60-a-week nominal " president " of the corporation , swore that this was the method adopted after the general had ordered that no more cashier 's checks be drawn to him because they were " too easy to trace . " For a time , Mr. Lamarre testi ? fled , the envelopes contained $1,000 bills , but this denomination was abandoned after it became known that the United States Treasury was " watching " the holders of such large notes , and lesser denominations were used For 1941 , the last year in which checks were used , he asserted , General Meyers received $67,303 from the company , the Aviation Electric Corporation of Dayton , Ohio . From then until the end of 1945 , he added , General Meyers got his money by cash , " and cash only . " 1941 Gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for the years 1941 and 1942 General Meyers received from - the company about $87,000 , about $52,000 of which was profit , the remainder representing repayments of his advances to it The corporation 's gross receipts for 1941 were $162,918 , coming from subcontract work awarded by the Bell Aircraft Corporation in its manufacture of war planes for the Army Air Forces , of which General Meyers ultimately became the second highest procurement officer . Of the $67,303 which went to General Meyers in 1941 , Mr. Lamarre testified , $34,810 was to repay the general 's cash advances to the business and the remaining $32,493 was thus analyzed : Payments to General Meyers from what were supposed to be the " executive salaries " of . Mr. Lamarre and another young man , $17,973 . Payment by the Aviation Electric Corporation of $10,000 to have the general 's Washington apartment decorated , $825 to have it aircooled , $2,995 for a new Cadillac sedan for the general , $700 for a radio for the general 's apartment . Apart from this there were expenditures by the company , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sedan , including a monogrammed automobile robe , and $101 to insure it . Pay to Decorator Questioned The $10,000 payment to the decorator , Neta Davis , was originally charged off to " sales expenses , " - the witness stated , but the auditors questioned this and for bookkeeping and income tax purposes Mr. Lamarre then attributed the sum to his own earnings . The air-conditioning of the general 's apartment , Mr. Lamarre added , was put down to " engineering expenses , " the Cadillac to " trucks and autos " for the company and the radio to " office furniture " Senator Homer Ferguson , committee chairman , brought out that since the money to pay for all this came from Government subcontracts the Government ultimately footed the bill . Mr. Lamarre was on the stand all day , except to give way briefly now and then to corroborating witnesses , including trades people to testify about the sedan , the decoratinE , job and the like . A thin , blond young man who pictured himself as having been the unquestioning ' creature of General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormously complex system of accounting by which , he declared , General Meyers kept the secret of his ownership of the Aviation Electric Corporation . The essential part of this elaborate structure , as Mr. Lamarre outlined it , was the fiction of " executive salaries " listed on the books for himself and T. E. Readnower , brother of Mrs. Lamarre . Mrs. Lamarre was secretary to General Meyers when he was - stationed at Wright Field . " War Industrialist " Drafted Mr. Lamarre testified that his brother-in-law was brought into the corporation late in 1942 and , although his actual pay was at the rate of $25 a week , it was rather hopefully forecast by General Meyers that his services as a war industrialist would keep him out of the Army . The draft did call Mr. Readnower , however , Mr. Lamarre went on , and the general directed an arrangement by which the recruit , who later turned up at Wright Field as a sergeant , was to receive $100 a month prom the company , despite his absence from it . But during all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the books , by the direction of the General , for an " executive salary " of $15,000 a year . Mr. Lamarre 's own " executive salary , l. ' he said , was $12,000 a year , plus $6,000 for his " travel expenses . " All this money , he testified , ultimately went to the General , less only enough for income taxes to be paid on the listed salaries . Asked by Senator Ferguson whether this arrangement kept relatively low the income taxes being paid by the General himself , Mr. Lamarre testified that this was a fact . For 1842 , when Aviation Electric Corporation was still working on Government subcontracts , Mr. Lamarre identified a series of chicks drawn to himself or to Mr. Readnower and aggregating $27,948 . Checks Drawn in Pairs All of these were drawn in pairs , - that is , two checks for identical amounts on July 13 , for example , and two for identical amounts on Aug. 28 , and so on . Except for about $7,500 of this which was withheld to pay some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lamarre testified , all of the money went to the general . A delegation of wounded soldiers from Walter Reed Hospital , headed by a lieutenant of the Woman 's Army Corps with her neck in a cast , arrived at the outset of the afternoon session Of the subcommittejand sat quietly for the rest of the day . The first of the day 's corroborating witnesses was Miss Davis , who testified that the $10,000 for " doing " the Washington flat of General Meyers came in checks signed by the Aviation Electric Corporation . She said that the general had told her that he was going to use the apartment to entertain " very important people who would be coming there for business reasons . " She rejected with a smile the suggestion that it was a " lavish " apartment , but added , " It was a very nice apartment , I must say . " It consisted , she said , of a living room , a dining room , two bedrooms and a kitchen . Frank E. Dietz of the Cdrnbustion Air Corporation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditioning . He said that he remembered that General Meyers was having four units installed instead of the customary one . Testifies on Cai Purchase Vernon M. Knox of the Capital Cadillac Company testified that General Meyers bought his $2,995 sedan Dec. 31 , 1941 , the last day before such purchases were " frozen " under - priorities applied in sequel to Pearl Harbor . He stated that General Meyers used the back of a War Department routing slip to write out for him the name of the company which was to pay , the Aviation Electric Corporation . Herman S. Cole of the District of Columbia Department of Vehicles testified that General Meyers ' application for title was not acted upon until Jan. 6 , 1942 , and , in the belief of the witness , was not actually filed until that day . Nevertheless , he said , General Meyers submitted an affidavit that the car " was bought , paid for and used prior to Jan. 1 , 1942 . " It was brought out that the Aviation Electric Corporation 's check in payment for the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Melvin A. Taylor , garage manager at the apartment hotel where the general lived , known as " 2400 Sixteenth Street , " told how the coming of the general 's new " blue Fleetwood Cadillac " had given him two Cadillacs to take care of , for General Meyers already had a " brown Cadillac . " Mrs. Meyers used the new car , the witness stated , and the general the older one . Mr. Lamarre had told of the Cadillac transaction in this testimony : " General Meyers called me on the phone in the last days of 1941 avid told me he wanted to buy a Cadillac . He told me to forward a check by special delivery to reach him before midnight of Dec. 31 . " Concerning the cessation of checks to General Meyers , Mr. Lamarre asserted : " Toward the end of 1941 the general told me to stop buying cashier 's checks . He said any money transmitted to him thereafter was to be cash  --  and only cash . As I recall it , he said cashier 's checks were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had money on hand he would write to me to contact him . Sometimes he came to Dayton . Sometimes I went to Washington . " Then , the testimony ran , Mr. Lamarre would fill an envelope with money and hand it over to the general , either in Dayton or here . William Rogers , chief of subcommittee counsel , put into the record copies of letters exchanged between General Meyers and David Johnson , who at one time was listed as president of Aviation Electric Corporation , in an effort to show that the general had sought to arrange an explanation for his connection with the company , if necessity should arise . General Meyers was represented as having written to Mr. Johnson back in April of 1940 that there had been " some current comment " about the relations of an Air Forces officer with the corporation and tha , t he , therefore , proposed to make a " most generous offer " to liquidate at 6 per cent discount the debt owed on notes to him . Mr. Johnson was represented as replying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to effect such a liquidation , even though the general 's offer was " most generous . "
