txt  | Tevis had extended Wells Fargo 's activities to the train , but he did not abandon the stagecoach express . And neither did the highwayman . The county jails and the state prisons did a thriving business . Bandits plagued Wells Fargo long before Tevis became president , and they were still busy twenty years later after he had left the company . Hardly had the chief carrier of Wells Fargo express changed from the old-time six-horse stage to the picturesque early railroad before brigands in the fastnesses of the High Sierras turned their attention to the Iron Horse . The transcontinental route had been open only a year and a half before there occurred on the Central Pacific , not far from the CaliforniaNevada state line , a train robbery of proportions great enough to rock not merely the West but the entire land . On the morning of the 4th of November , 187o , the Central Pacific 's Train Number One , bound east for Ogden , Utah ? a forty-eight-hour trip ? pulled slowly out of the long train shed at Oakland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day coach , it carried a brand-new car with rounded ends similar to those George M. Pullman was building back in Chicago . Only this was not a Pullman sleeper , but one of the glittering Silver Palace cars that the Central Pacific was operating on its own account . It had its own kitchen and eating facilities , specializing chiefly in tinned dishes . No luxury was too great for the new Silver Palace cars . Indeed the advertisements stated that they possessed all the comforts in creation . That very year Appleton 's Railway Guide to the United States and Canada said of them : In no part of the world is travel made so easy and comfortable as on the Pacific Railroad . To travelers from the East it is a constant delight and to ladies and families it is accompanied with absolutely no fatigue or discomfort . One lives at home in the Palace Car with as much true enjoyment as in the home drawing room . . . . The slow rate of speed , which averages but twenty to thirty miles per hour day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy motion , most soothing and agreeable . The days of boisterous times , rough railroad men and bullies in the Far West , are gone .  | Spoken like a gentleman , Mr. Appleton . The days of the Diesel-electric and the silvery streamlined train making its way from Chicago to San Francisco in thirty-nine hours still were far ahead . But the days of roughness upon the railroad were not gone , as events upon the Central Pacific railroad demonstrated that very day . Train Number One was an important train indeed . Not only did its small , brisk locomotive with red trim and balloon stack haul the splendid Silver Palace Car and the little yellow day coach of the Central Pacific , but in its express car rode the United States mail and the valuable packages entrusted to the care of Wells , Fargo and Company . On this particular morning of November 4th , the express included a heavy shipment of gold and silver bullion and greenbacks , much of it for the payroll of the prosperous Yellow Jacket Mine at Virginia City . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street , San Francisco , to the Wells Fargo branch at Virginia City . Only those in charge of the express were supposed to know the nature and magnitude of the shipment . The little engine was to haul Number One only as far as Sacramento , 150 miles from Oakland Wharf . In those days the Central Pacific trains took a round-about route to Sacramento through Niles Canyon and Stockton . The far shorter route by way of Benicia and the Contra Costa train-ferry was yet to come . At Sacramento Number One would change locomotives . An even stouter iron horse would carry it up the Big Hill to Truckee at the summit of the Sierras , 7,000 feet above sea level . It was a long haul up and over the Big Hill , and that stretch was the most ambitious feat of railroad engineering that America had yet accomplished . A long pull and a beautiful one , with the constant vista of the magnificent canyon of the American River far below , and a halt at Sandy Hook so that passengers could stretch their legs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On this day in 1870 there was a two-hour halt at Truckee due to a freight wreck up the line . The passengers did not  | much care . Freight wrecks were not uncommon on the Central Pacific in those early days . The main street along the railroad track at Truckee was lined with gambling houses , brothels and saloons and for two hours the Silver Palace Car was neglected . When Number One finally managed to pull out of Truckee , it was after midnight . Conductor Mitchell noted the hour and spoke of it to the Wells Fargo messenger , Marshall , who had come through with the train all the way from Oakland Wharf . It was down grade and easy sailing now all the way to Reno and the Humboldt Plain , and Conductor Mitchell thought that Number One should make up some of her lost time . But then there was an unexpected halt at Verdi , seven miles to the east . Mitchell did not recall that anyone had pulled the bellcord . Just another of those unexpected stops , he thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miners with a lantern , or a silly brakeman playing tricks . But the men who stopped C.P.R.R. Number One at Verdi J in the very early morning of November 5th were neither drunk nor carousing . They were cold sober , and they meant business . A code telegram from San Francisco had advised them that the money for the payroll of the Yellow Jacket Mine was in the express car . " Am sending you sixty dollars , " the message had read laconically , which meant $6o,000 to them . Without hesitation they had gone into action . The train once flagged and halted , the bandits climbed aboard . Two of them clambered into the engine-cab . They covered Engineer Small with their sawed-off shotguns . " Keep quiet and obey orders , " they told him . The fireman dropped off the other side of the cab and began running through the woods . Five more masked men climbed into the combination express and baggage car . Quickly they covered Marshall , the Wells Fargo messenger . Back in the day coach Conductor Mitchell fumed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hours late ? Through the end door he went into the baggage-express car . A sorry sight greeted him . The place was a shambles ,  | and he was at once subdued and held quiet at the muzzle of a shotgun . The bandits were taking the gold bullion and coins , nearly $42,000 of it , and were preparing to throw it out through the side door of the car at their own good pleasure . By quick thought and no little strategy , Marshall had managed to hide a few bars of gold bullion in among the firewood that had been cut and neatly stacked for his little stove . The robbers never saw them . The bandits decided that it would altogether too dangerous to make their getaway from the train , considering the Palace Car full of passengers back of the express car . Two of the brigands shoved Mitchell back into the day coach . With a knowledge born of experience one of them reached down between the car platforms and pulled out the link-pin of the old-fashioned coupling . After that Engineer Small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started the engine and the baggage-express car down the grade . For five miles more they went . Then they halted beside an old quarry . The bandits took off their boots , tossed the gold and specie into them , opened the side door of the car and disappeared into the night with their loot . With the locomotive and tender once more hitched to the cars , Train Number One proceeded to Reno . " Boisterous times " in the Far West with a vengeance ! It would seem as if that November day in 1870 was to be an exceedingly unfortunate one for Train Number One of the Central Pacific . It was not twenty hours after the first holdup when it was in trouble again . This time it was in eastern Nevada , not far from the Utah line , 385 miles from Verdi . The tactics were much the same as in the first hold-up . As Number One pulled out of the small hamlet of Independence , four men jumped aboard ; two on the locomotive and two on the rear platform of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coupling . ( It might be noted that right after this the Central Pacific adopted a car-coupling device so constructed that the link-pin could not be easily removed , at least from the car platform . Necessity invents a good deal ! ) Engine and express car continued up the grade  | ahead of the rest of the train which slowly came to a stop at Pequop siding . At this safe distance the engine was halted and while one of the bandits stood guard over the crew , the other three robbed the Wells Fargo car . After the previous experience that day , anticipating what was happening , the messenger had hidden some $10,000 in treasure which had been taken aboard after the first robbery in a crevice of the car . It came through safely . The bandits took out $4,000 in bullion and gold coin , twenty-three packages of mail and a bar of silver , a mere pittance compared with the affair at Verdi . They got away safely across the desert . The locomotive and the baggage-express car backed down the hill to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , while warning was given to the authorities and another country-wide search began for the robbers . Both jobs had been planned with care and precision . Even telegraph wires had been cut . James B. Hume , that exceedingly wise chief detective of Wells Fargo , saw it all as an extremely well-planned operation . This he told to John J. Valentine ; Valentine might have cursed , but instead , being a pious man , he contented himself with putting up a reward of $10,000 for the apprehension of the bandits : $5,000 for identity of the bandits and another $5,000 for bringing them into custody . The United States Post Office , apparently not so exercised , offered $500 as a reward ; and then the State of Nevada added $20,000 of its own . From San Francisco up to Reno and to Virginia City , and far beyond , the sheriffs and the Wells Fargo police went to work . Not for one moment was the double hold-up taken lightly . The San Francisco Chronicle wrote hysterically : We Americans get terribly indignant when we read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Italy . We wonder how such things can take place in a civilized country . We make no scruples of accusing the government of supineness , or the population of complicity , in the acts of the robbers . We have our own brigandage and it promises to eclipse the European institution in audacity and magnitude . The evil has been developing for a long time and it now has reached a stage where it threatens  | the welfare of the entire Pacific Coast . From horse-stealing it ascended to stagecoach-plundering and from that it has advanced to seizing and robbing railroad trains . If it continues to progress , the next step will be the sacking and burning of towns . We trust that energetic steps which are being taken to secure the arrest of the brigands will succeed . . . so that the criminals will either stretch hemp or receive their quietus from the bullets of their pursuers ' rifles . If they should escape it will become the duty of the railroad company to send an armed guard with each train , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is done there can be no guarantee that the Verdi affair will not be repeated as often as the Knights of the Road think it necessary to replenish their purses at the expense of the public . We have seen the two train robberies . Now let us see what Wells Fargo and the law enforcement agencies did about them . The first hold-up at Verdi had happened just a little after midnight on a Saturday morning . It was dawn before Train Number One pulled into Reno and the first alarms had been spread ; before Jim Kinkead , the veteran sheriff of Washoe County , was on the job . By night the countryside was aroused . Posses had been sent in every direction . All roads were closed to traffic . Every man who tried to pass over them was stopped and closely questioned before being allowed to go on . In Sardine Valley , just northwest of Verdi , Nicholas Pearson and his wife kept a modest tavern hardly larger than a small farmhouse . Yet the Pearsons were popular , and many patrons came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived that Saturday evening of the hold-up was a shy , quiet fellow , plainly dressed , and fairly typical of many casual travelers who had come to them for nearly twenty years past . He gave his name as John Squires and asked for a room for the night . He got it , and a rousing good supper as well . He went up to his room immediately afterwards . A little later two other men , who gave their names as Parsons and Gilchrist , also came to the tavern , had supper and were given a room just across the hall from the one assigned to Squires . Parsons  | returned downstairs and sat in the common room of the inn with the innkeeper and his wife . Mrs. Pearson was an exceedingly shrewd and alert woman . Twenty years of tavernkeeping had made her a good judge of people . Sitting in her rocking chair with her knitting , she heard Squires cross the hall upstairs and go into the room occupied by Parsons and Gilchrist . Somehow that aroused her suspicions . But she kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little after the late November dawn , Parsons and Squires rode off to the north . Hardly had they disappeared over the thin snow and through the pines in one direction before Nels Hammond , Wells Fargo agent at Reno , accompanied by Deputy Sheriff Lamb of Washoe , rode in from the other on the track of the bandits who had held up Train Number One at Verdi . Gilchrist was in the common room of the inn , apparently unconcerned by the new arrivals . Hammond and Lamb asked Mrs. Pearson if any other guests had spent the night . When she said that there had been two who had ridden off for Sierra Valley , the two agents of the law , in search of their quarries , pushed on . Gilchrist watched them disappear , then went out himself . Mrs. Pearson watched him making his way to an outhouse just below the tavern . Something was wrong . Just what she could not tell . Nels Hammond and Lamb had told her that there were not fewer than seven men involved in the Verdi robbery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outhouse herself , but by a different path than Gilchrist had taken . A thin wooden wall separated the men 's section from the women 's . There was a knot in the wood and , unabashed , Mrs. Pearson pried it out . This was no time for false modesty . Gilchrist was in the other part of the shack , fully dressed . He was seated with an old boot in his hand and out of it he was pouring coin , bright , shiny , twenty-dollar gold pieces , into the other hand . Mrs. Pearson was transfixed . Never before had she seen anything like that amount of money . Although she did not know it , she was looking at nearly $12,000 in gold , part of the loot from Verdi . Slowly Gilchrist replaced the money he had taken out of the  | boot . Then he lowered the boot into the vault of the privy , went whistling back to the tavern . He looked for Pearson , but Pearson was gone . He too had had misgivings and had slipped out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any moment to be felled with a bullet in his back . He had gone to find a sheriff . Generally when you most want the police , they are extremely difficult to find . With the entire countryside at that moment filled with officers , Pearson went a full dozen miles afoot before he ran into Sheriff Jim Kinkead of Reno . Kinkead had been inspecting the abandoned stone quarry where the robbers had first taken their loot from the train . Aside from a broken green treasure box , the pick-ax that had broken it apart , and a shotgun left behind in the flight of the robbers , there was nothing . With innkeeper Pearson he returned to Sardine Valley . They hunted for Gilchrist and found him hidden in the loft of the barn back of the tavern . He offered no resistance to arrest . More than that , he talked quite freely of his accomplices . The master mind of the entire plan ? there almost always is a master mind ? had been A. J. Davis , a likable fellow who had once been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was known and liked from one end of the Comstock Lode country to the other as Big Jack . Sheriff Kinkead immediately telegraphed Captain Downey of the Virginia City police ; old friendships were forgotten and Big Jack Davis immediately was put under arrest . He confessed his part in the crime at Verdi and led Downey and Kinkead to a culvert under the railroad near Verdi and , from it drew forth $19,760 in gold coin . From then on the law moved swiftly indeed . Tilton Cockerill , a former army officer , who was one of the gang , was found in a public house located over the state line , but there were no complications because of that . In those simple days extradition generally was accomplished at the muzzle of a gun . Sol Jones was arrested with him . Together they led the police to a place where $7,345 had been buried . The $41,600 gradually was being brought together .  | J. E. Chapman was the man who had sent the " sixty dollars " warning telegram from San Francisco . Detectives searched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next they took the first Central Pacific train to Reno . Chapman rode the same train , although at the time they did not know it . Upon arrival all hands adjourned to the grog-shop near the depot . Two more detectives ( local men ) came into the place . They had with them the crestfallen Sol Jones . Jones espied his fellow bandit and gaily said , " Hello , Chapman ! What brings you here ? " That remark cost Chapman a sentence of eighteen years . Having turned state 's evidence , Gilchrist and a man named Roberts went free . Squires , Jones , Cockerill and Parsons were given sentences of twenty-one years each ; but Big Jack Davis who had engineered the entire project and had confessed it all , escaped with only a ten-year sentence which a kindly governor of Nevada cut to three . " He died by an error of judgment in ' 77 , " says Neill Wilson . " His error of judgment was in trying to stop a stage defended by Wells Fargo messengers , Eugene Blair , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So much for the first robbery and its prompt solution . Out in the easterly edge of the Nevada desert , the second hold-up of Train Number One also was being avenged . Nevada law seemed to work with equal efficiency on both sides of the state . The second band to descend upon Number One in twenty hours was composed of deserters from Fort Halleck , two of whom had carelessly worn their uniforms . That brought the Army into the chase and a round-up party was duck soup for the Army . Four posses went into the field together with a troop of cavalry . The entire gang was rounded up within the area eighty-five miles south of the Great Salt Lake . All the loot was recovered and the Army administered justice in its own efficient way . Train Number One was robbed again in 1882 , involving this time the only figure on either side of the train robbery business that I ever knew personally , Aaron Y. Ross . Ross stood six-foot-four in his stocking feet , and he must have  | weighed all of 250 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old . A State of Maine man , he first came to Wells Fargo at the end of the ' sixties . In 1857 he had journeyed from Maine to New York , had stopped there just long enough to climb to the top of the spire of Trinity Church at the head of Wall Street to get the view of the city . From New York he had taken ship by way of the Isthmus of Panama to San Francisco . Once in California he tried his luck in the Mother Lode for a time , but the digging was thin there in 1857 . He worked his way , prospecting , up into eastern Oregon and into Idaho , finally into Montana . Next he was driving stage up around Helena , then known as Christmas Gulch . It was an easy enough matter for Aaron Ross to move from one side of the box seat of the coach to the other , to become a shotgun messenger for the express . For a long time he operated as Wells Fargo messenger between Helena and Corinne , Utah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw silver by the ton . There was a stage run for a time , between Pioche and Salt Lake , but finally Aaron Ross found himself in clover , in charge of the Wells Fargo car on trains One and Two of the famed Central Pacific . So stood his record one January morning in 1882 when he was alone in the express car of Number One , slowly moving across Nevada toward the Utah line . It was the dull hour just before dawn and Ross rested his giant frame upon a cot in the car , while Number One plugged forward through the sagebrush . At the little signal stop of Montello stood a single wooden shack , bunk-house for the Chinese who worked as a local track gang . A dozen of them lived in the stuffy , unventilated , over-heated place . Three hours before the arrival of Number One , there had been callers at Montello , uninvited and unwanted . Five of them had ridden up from the dark of the desert on a moonless night , had pelted the shack with rocks ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese , not accustomed to such raids , piled out of their shack into the night and up the track toward Toano , twenty-five miles away , just as fast as their legs could carry them . Their visitors re- placed them in the bunkhouse and awaited the coming of the eastbound express train . A baggage car followed the tender of the big-stacked locomotive , then came the Wells Fargo express car , finally three or four coaches and a Pullman sleeper or two . With the exception of the men in the engine cab , passengers and crew were mostly asleep . Ross was awakened by the sudden stopping of the train . For a moment he thought that they were at Toano , a divisional operating point where he was accustomed to receiving silver from the mines to the south , and a must stop for every train . He looked at his watch . For once they were well ahead of time , a most unusual happening on the Central Pacific of those days . As Ross rubbed his eyes there came a tap on the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted to him to " Hop out ! " Ross looked more closely and saw the muzzle of a rifle pointed through a crack in the door . Now Aaron Y. Ross had been brought up carefully in the Wells Fargo doctrine that express cargo was to be delivered at destination . He decided then and there that he would not " hop out " or get out in any other fashion , or even open the heavily barred doors of the express car . Aaron Ross did not get out . He held the fort alone . For three hours and twenty minutes he held it against unceasing and terrific attack . It must have seemed an eternity to him . Afterwards they found the stout wooden sides of the express car riddled with bullets . Forty had entered the car . Ross was wounded , several times , but not seriously ; his hands , his face , and his body were covered with blood . But he managed to bandage his wounded left arm and still keep on loading and reloading his faithful Winchester . Fortunately he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandits , tired of shooting at the seemingly impenetrable fortress , tried other tactics . At the point of a revolver they induced the engineer to uncouple the mail car , which was between the locomotive and the express car , take it down  | the track and then catapult it against Ross 's fort , full steam on . This did n't work , either . The engineer saw to that . Once , twice , three times they tried the trick , then abandoned it . The fuel in the engine tender was getting low . Next they crept along under the edge of the express car and talked to one another in loud voices : " We 've got to build a fire . We 'll burn him out . " Ross listened to them in silence , but not in fear . Seemingly he never knew the meaning of the word fear . He reloaded his rifle . There was no fire ; there was no firewood and not enough left in the engine tender for a worthwhile blaze . The ruse failed . Ross waited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Number Two , came past . It took the siding at Montello , stopped for a moment , and then moved on . The engineer of Number One , still at revolver point , had motioned it on . Number Two 's engineer had been tempted to get out and investigate . But he pulled his throttle and Number Two headed down the long straight track into the west . Aaron Ross 's heart must have sunk a bit as he heard it disappear in the distance . But he merely held his gun and waited . Finally the bandits were quiet . Suddenly horses ' hooves were heard . Ross put his keen eye to a bullet hole in the side wall and saw the five bandits rapidly ride away . At last they were under pursuit . The conductor of Number Two had given an alarm at the next station , some ten or twelve miles to the west , and a posse had come to the rescue . Ross unbolted the door of the express car and let them in . The danger was over . And in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be forever known as " Hold-the-Fort " Ross . Wells Fargo agent W. P. Bannon at Ogden telegraphed Superintendent Valentine at San Francisco , saying : " Ross 's hand badly torn by bullet and groin discolored by spent ball . Feels jubilant and will probably want day off one trip . " Which was surely a modest reward for a great deal of effort . The treasure box in the express car had been saved . There was , after all , only $600 in gold in it . But in the mail car  | just ahead , which the bandits had used as a battering ram , there was nearly half a million dollars in unminted silver which entirely escaped their attention . The best of bandits sometimes are that way . When Aaron Ross came into my office in the old Wells Fargo building on lower Broadway in New York , he was still on the job at the age of seventy-five , one of the most trusted messengers of the company . In fact , he had just brought in a heavy shipment of silver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . There were 342 bars of it , valued roughly at a little over half a million dollars and Ross had been given the shipment at Oakland , to bring it through to Ogden . At Ogden his relief messenger had turned up ill , and Holdthe-Fort continued with it to Chicago , and then on to New York where he turned it over to the Wells Fargo bank . It was Ross 's first visit to New York in fifty-five years , and it was all too short a one . He got in on Erie Nine in the morning and went west on the Erie that evening at eight . But we made the best of it for him . We took him uptown in an automobile along Riverside Drive to Grant 's Tomb , through Central Park and down Fifth Avenue to lunch at the old Waldorf-Astoria . Then we returned to lower Broadway on the subway and went to the top of the Woolworth Building , then the highest in New York . I stood with him as he gazed at downtown Manhattan , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great bridges over the East River . " How do you like it , chief ? " said I. " I liked that view from the top of Trinity Church spire that I got the other time I was here , " he answered . That was all . Aaron Ross was not much given to casual conversation . A few months later I rode with him on a Wells Fargo car over the Rio Grande through the Colorado mountains , one of his final runs with the express . I plied him again and again for the details of his earlier days with the company . He was courteous , but he would tell me nothing . " I 'm not used to talking about myself , " he finally said to me . I understood . Aaron Y. Ross was not that sort of a hero . Throughout those early days and even into the recent past  | the business of train robbery continued . The number of holdups , and the gun battles between express messengers and bandits is legion . It would take many books to chronicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the contribution of one iron-nerved express messenger whose name never got into the records . He evidently was a man who valued his life and who had an inventive turn of mind . To him , whoever he was , goes the credit for the " train robber eradicator . " This simple device consisted of a short " L " - shaped gas-pipe extending through the floor of the car and down under it . When the messenger was suspicious of trouble all he had to do was to extinguish the lamps in this car and drop a lighted signal fuse into the pipe . It flared with a brilliant white flame , like a searchlight , which illuminated the entire space under the car and around it , while the messenger in the open door was left in complete darkness ? so complete that he could almost feel the tip of a bandit 's rifle without being seen himself . Before the invention of the " eradicator " it had been the other way around . Standing in the door of a well-lighted car he was a shining target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " reversed conditions . It was one factor that helped wipe out the train robber 's profession . There were other causes , of course . Not the least of them , the long-distance telephone and the automobile . But these things , after all , are only mechanical . The great factors in the elimination of the train-robber west of the Mississippi have been the unending courage , strength and ready wit of the men who have been chosen to guard the treasure-cars of the mail and the express .  | Six years had passed since the last railroad spike was driven at Promontory Point by the Great Salt Lake . In these six years the completion of the Pacific railroad had worked a change in the life and habits of the people of the Far West . The old carefree days were passing . The Gold Rush was history ; most of the mining camps of California were abandoned or were changing to little villages and towns that began to bear something of the stamp of the East . Gone , too , were the long caravans of covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry Indians . People traveled across the continent now in the gaudy cars of the Silver Palace Car Company or the sleeping cars of Mr. Pullman . Refinement was spreading its silky gloves over the West , even if you still could take an occasional pot-shot at a prairie dog or a buffalo from the train . Soon San Francisco would be as civilized as Boston , but much more entertaining ? or at least , San Franciscans thought so . " Farewell to romance , " the Forty-niners were chanting over their drinks . " The old days are gone , we shall not see their like again . " But they were wrong . One fine day there appeared in Calaveras County ? the same Calaveras of the Jumping Frog ? a man as daring and picturesque and , if you like , as romantic as the West had ever seen . Once again the harassed old Wells Fargo was in for a time of it . He was a thin , wiry , stern-featured man who looked a little like a country parson or a schoolteacher ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in after days . When he first entered the life of Wells Fargo in 1875 , rather violently , he was getting along past middle age , and his dark hair , which was beginning to recede from a high forehead , was sprinkled with gray . Tipped back on his head , for he was usually hot and covered with dust , was an ancient black derby hat . All the rest of his attire , with the exception of heavy well-worn boots , generally was covered by a long linen duster . Though he was most of the time many a tedious mountain mile from any railroad , he carried a large valise . Harry Morse , a detective whom James B. Hume called in to help the company make this gentleman 's acquaintance , described him as " elegantly dressed , carrying a little cane . He wore a natty little derby hat , a diamond pin , a large diamond ring on his little finger and a heavy gold watch and chain . He was about five feet eight inches in height , straight as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high cheek bones , and a large handsome gray moustache and imperial : the rest shaven clean . . . " This was how Morse dcscribed Charles E. Bolton ( or Boles ) when he finally met him  | in Bush Street in San Francisco . Obviously this was not his garb when professionally engaged . In the mountains , however , his head was usually covered with a flour sack with roughly cut eye holes ? and the linen duster . This , you might say , was his business dress . It was in this dress and firmly entrenched behind a double-barrel shotgun , which he was never known to use , that Black Bart ( his business name ) introduced himself to many an unfortunate stagecoach driver and Wells Fargo messenger . This was the Black Bar who , in Wells Fargo annals , was to become for a long time more prominent than president Lloyd Tevis himself . At least there was vastly greater newspaper comment on his comings and goings . On a bright July day in 1875 , several persons afterward remembered , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stopped at a ranch house and , following the hospitable custom of the country , broke bread with the family . The ranchman and his family found him a genial waggish soul , fond of cracking jokes . They enjoyed having him at the table . But later they recalled that he had been most reticent about himself . Indeed , that was the way everyone found him , and if there had been anything of particular interest in his past career he never divulged it . Yet , from the fact that there was an old bullet-hole just below his ribs ? something that nobody in Calaveras knew in those days ? he must have had something in his past well worth talking about . To anyone who might have chanced to meet him in the wilds of Calaveras County seventy years ago , after first sight he would not have seemed to be a country parson or schoolmaster . Although he was a quiet , unpretentious fellow , extremely polite with almost everyone he met , especially when ladies were present , there was something about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustache , and of the very sharp , cold , steady blue eyes that would suggest an early Californian or a professional gambler . There was nothing sleepy about those eyes . Later that July day the stage from Sonora to Milton , bearing  | the express and the treasure boxes of Wells , Fargo and Company came rumbling down the dusty road through the soft , green forest . Holding the reins over the six horses was Billy Hodges , an outstanding overland stage driver with a record nearly as colorful as that of any man in the service . Behind him on the top of the smart Concord coach , as well as inside , was a handful of passengers . Then , suddenly , Billy Hodges pulled up his horses sharply , put on the long brake rod with all the strength of his seasoned hands and the creaking wheels locked . The stage squealed to a stop . In the middle of the road directly in front of the lead horses stood a man in a linen duster . He was tall and those cold , blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looked over the top of a sawed-off double-barreled shotgun , straight at Billy Hodges . " If they dare to shoot , give them a solid volley , boys , " spoke the man in the linen duster . Billy Hodges glanced at the rocks alongside the highroad and thought he saw at least half a dozen gun barrels pointing at him . That was enough for him . " No use trying to do anything , " he said . " He 's got a gang with him . Look at those guns . If you want to live , do n't monkey with your guns . " The man in the linen duster ordered Hodges to throw the green wooden treasure-box of Wells Fargo onto the ground at once . He lost no time in complying . The highwayman produced a hatchet from under his linen duster and in a moment he had chopped the box open and was stuffing the money and the valuables it contained into his pockets . " That will be about all , boys , " he called out . Then jovially he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " That evening the stage rolled into Milton bringing the first tale of the man in the linen duster , who , for the next eight long years , was to be the scourge and terror of the California roads . The men who sat around the taverns of Milton that nigh t got the story dramatically , but entirely wrong . Everybody iii town was talking of how a whole band of robbers had held up Billy Hodges ' overland stage and the Wells Fargo express . But the next day came the sequel . It seemed upon investigation that  | the man in the linen duster had worked alone . The " gu pointing over the rocks were only sticks . Five months went by before the lone robber of Calaveras was again heard from . Perhaps he had found the holiday expensive , for it was just three days after Christmas when he jumped out in front of another Wells Fargo stage , this one bound north from San Juan to Marysville . He still wore his linen duster and still carried his sawed-off shotgun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the driver and messenger , he tried to shield himself in front of the lead horses , a trick that he occasionally practiced later . This time , as before , there was no hesitation in obeying his command to throw out the express box . Again , he ripped it open and disappeared in the woods with its valuable contents stuffed in his clothes . Five months more and another hold-up was added to his record . This time it was the stage from Yreka to Roseburg , up near the Oregon state line . Again it was a successful job . The reputation of the man in the linen duster was spreading . Weird tales , some fanciful and some true , ran through the countryside . W a en kept their children locked in their homes for fear of a visitation . But they had nothing to fear , for the brigand was a gentle soul indeed who was not interested in robbing women and children . On one of his hold-ups a woman passenger in the stage became hysterical and tossed her purse at Black Bart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courteously : " Madam , I do not wish your money . In that respect I honor only the good offices of Wells Fargo . " A gentle man , devoted only to the small , green boxes from Montgomery Street . ' ' Wells Fargo was outraged . President Lloyd Tevis and General Superintendent John J. Valentine called in James B. Hume , chief of the Wells Fargo police , and the latter went to work on the case . He did more . He engaged a helper , one Harry Morse , a private detective in San Francisco , and put Johnny Thacker , a veteran member of the Wells Fargo police , to work . But the mysterious man in the linen duster was to prove the toughest problem that they ever tackled in all their long experience . No one knew his name or where he came from . Stage drivers and express messengers seldom could give much of a description  | of him because of the usual flour-sack mask . Some of the mountain people , however , had met him face to face and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polite and agreeable man , who came from the East and who said that he had been a miner and that he suffered from a disease of the throat ; he had to rest a good deal . But for a man who was not in the best of health and who was fond of sleep he was astonishingly active . Once in three days he lugged that old valise of his for all of eighty miles over the mountains . As the valise held his unbreeched gun and his blankets , under which he spent many a night in the open , it must have been a fairly heavy affair . And it takes a pretty good walker to cover twenty-six mountain miles between sun-up and sun-down , even without a heavy valise . The Wells Fargo detectives on his trail found that following a robbery he never stopped to make camp and cook a meal until he was twelve or fifteen miles away from the scene of the hold-up . Quite a wonderful walker was the man in the linen duster . Eventually Black Bart found his valise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he discarded it and carried his gun in his blanket-roll . The abandoned valise was found beside a mountain creek . Hume and his fellows searched it carefully for some clue of its owner . No luck . Black Bart rid himself finally of his reticence and took to ' cleaving facetious notes at the scene of his hold-ups , tormenting his pursuers . On a day in August , 1877 , he held up the stage from Fort Ross to Russian River . From the express box he took $30o in coin and a negotiable deposit check for another 300 . Then he cut open the mail sacks and helped himself . He left behind in the rifled express box this exquisite bit of verse : I 've labored long and hard for bread For honor and for riches , But on my corns too long you 've tred , You fine-haired sons of bitches . Black Bart , the Po 8 So at last the man in the linen duster was named and it was  | a good one . How pious John Valentine must have groaned when Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bart it was , and Black Bart it was to remain throughout the years to come . For a full year thereafter the people of Northern California seemingly spoke of no one else . In the entire history of the Western frontier there never had been so mysterious and so elusive a highwayman as he , nor one so original in his methods . Superstitious folk began to think that there must be something uncanny about him , something unearthly like the great legendary figure of Paul Bunyan . Consider a bandit who never once was known to ride a horse , but who , within a single twenty-four hours , had robbed two stagecoaches thirty miles apart , hold-ups separated by the roughest of mountain country ! It was all but inconceivable . What seven league boots did this Black Bart have that enabled him to dart here and there through the thicknesses of the great forests of the high Sierras ? Thousands of miles of rough mountain country the indefatigable Po 8 must have covered afoot , for eight years , carrying his valise or his blanket roll with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dread to the drivers of the stages than to the people of the countryside . The country folk were safe . It is not known that ever once was any of them disturbed . Wells Fargo was his quarry . Against Wells Fargo he continued his course , unrelentingly : from Calaveras county to Sonora and to Yuba , to Sierra and Butte and Plumas and Shasta and Trinity . And all the while he wrote his little verses , eventually to find their way to Montgomery Street , San Francisco , and to give no comfort there . But James B. Hume waited his turn . Wells Fargo never forgot . Black Bart was a gay wag who grew to enjoy notoriety . On a summer day in 1878 he held up the Wells Fargo stage bound from Quincy to Oroville . After he had helped himself to the contents of express box and mail pouches he left behind these verses , written in a meticulously even handwriting : Here I lay me down to sleep , To wait the coming morrow ; Perhaps success , perhaps defeat , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for bread , For honor and for riches , But on my corns too long you 've tread , You fine-haired sons of bitches . Let come what will , I 'll try it on , My condition ca n't be worse , And if there 's money in that box , ' T is money in my purse . Black Bart , the Po 8 Two stanzas added to the original version . Verses like these were the only clues he ever left for the perplexed police service of Wells Fargo . Year after year , robbery followed robbery . Black Bart was here ; Black Bart was there ; seemingly Black Bart was everywhere , but still there was no clue to his identity . And the cost to Wells Fargo was coming to a pretty penny . The company , however , was used to that sort of thing . Its ledgers contained one item after another of expenses paid in the pursuit of thieves , as well as in the repayment of sums lost or stolen in transit . But there came one occasion when the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was in 1882 , when he held up the stage from LaPorte to Oroville . Black Bart , stooping low as was his custom , was screening himself in front of the lead horses and at the same time trying to keep his shotgun pointed at his victim , when Wells Fargo man George Hackett took a desperate chance , brought his gun to his shoulder and fired . The horses reared and plunged and the highwayman was thrown aside , unhurt . Then the whip of the driver cracked over the backs of his sixhorse team and the stage jerked forward , while Hackett fired again at the man lying helplessly in the road . The shot went wild and , as the stage rolled on , Bart got up and darted into the deep woods which came down close to the roadside . Then came the day ! It was the third day of November , 1883 , and Black Bart had returned to the scene of his debut , the rough and winding old road from Milton to Sonora in Calaveras County . The stage  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It contained $4,100 in amalgam and $500 in cash . Black Bart in some way , occult or otherwise , must have known of the contents of that little green box . At any rate there he was back on the road where eight years before he had made his first appearance as a highwayman . The coach came rattling on . Suddenly from behind a rock stepped Black Bart just as he had done that July day in 1875 . His technique was unchanged . The driver , Reason McConnell , was alone on the stage . His only passenger , young Jimmy Rolleri , had got off a short way back to see if he could scare up some game . This bothered Black Bart . He did n't know where the passenger might be , but he proceeded as usual . " Throw down the express box , " he ordered McConnell . ' But the box was fastened to the floor of the stage . Bart forced McConnell to unhitch his team and walk the horses over the crest of the hill , while he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was getting to be the most complicated hold-up Bart had ever rigged . By the time Bart had got the loot and was backing out of the coach , McConnell and Jimmy had joined forces . Jimmy 's rifle blazed away at the retreating Bart , but he managed to slip into the brush . Either Jimmy or McConnell had scored a hit , for Bart was seen to falter as he faded out of sight . Black Bart had been more than a little shaken by the unexpected angles of this hold-up . He left behind , not his latest verses , but a handkerchief , his hat , a magnifying glass , and a case for field glasses . On the handkerchief ( to the joy of Montgomery Street and James B. Hume ) was a laundry mark ? F.X.O.7 This hold-up near Sonora was Black Bart 's twenty-eighth , and it was his last . The Wells Fargo detectives lost no time in tracing the laundry mark . It was a long search . The laundries of a dozen towns were visited , and a little laundry agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in San Francisco ) , identified the mark . It belonged , the manager said , to a thin , sharp-eyed man with a drooping mustache , who always brought  | his wash and called for it himself . His name ? C. E. Bolton , living at 37 Second Street . The Wells Fargo detective , Johnny Thacker , got a warrant , searched this room , investigated Bolton 's movements before this Sonora robbery , and it was not long before Thacker met Bolton in the laundry agency . Without formal introductions Wells Fargo finally faced the man who for eight years had concerned himself so intimately with their express shipments . Black Bart made neither fight nor protest . He just smiled and said nothing . His arrest was a painful surprise to the city detectives at San Francisco police headquarters . They recognized Bart as a man whom , for years , they had seen almost every day at a bakery in Kearney Street , where they often ate . No linen duster for San Francisco . At times , Bart had sat at the same table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You boys are good , " he told them . " Those up-country sheriffs are no good . Too bad they could n't send a few of you up into the hills to get hold of that Black Bart . " There were red faces on the detective force on the day Black Bart was arrested . Gradually the facts about him came out : his name , he first said , was Charles E. Bolton , and he had lived for nearly ten years in the home of a widow in downtown San Francisco . Later he said that he had been born in Jefferson County , New York , as Charles E. Boles . He was a veteran of the Union Army , mustered in at Decatur , Illinois , with a good war record . He had left a wife behind him who was found to be living in Hannibal , Missouri . The widow with whom he boarded in San Francisco said that he was an ideal tenant : " So quiet , so respectable and so punctual about his room rent , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bolton , or Boles , in the early ' eighties . One of the best ( which has never been verified ) was that Black Bart had been " Professor " Charles Boles in charge of a little one-room schoolhouse in Sierra County . For some years , the story goes , he taught young Californians but suddenly tired of it all . The deadly routine , the uninspiring work of filling young minds with book learning , got on his nerves . One day the sound of a passing Wells  | Fargo coach filled him with an idea as sinister as it was simple . He knew that Wells Fargo coaches carried treasure : gold , and plenty of it . He had talked with the drivers . They were free with gossip and with information . It all sounded rather easy . And so the teaching profession lost one of its everyday ornaments , and the highway profession gained a highly spectacular one . This fascinating yarn about Black Bart is stoutly disputed by Joseph Henry Jackson who has made a detailed study of the man and whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstanding highwaymen in the California of yesteryear . Jackson says that he can find no proof that Black Bart ever taught school , and attributes the whole yarn to an imaginative reporter on the San Francisco Chronicle . Schoolmaster or not , California never knew another stagecoach bandit like Black Bart . For all his twenty-seven successful hold-ups ( and the one failure ) Black Bart was sentenced to San Quentin Prison for not less than six years , a fairly long term for a man of fiftyfive . He was released , however , from San Quentin on January 23 , 1888 , and thereafter disappeared entirely from public sight . It was said that he went back to his profession , that an occasional hold-up here and there was the work of the renowned Black Bart . But Jimmie Hume and Johnnie Thacker never believed those rumors ; there was no linen duster ; there were no poems ; it just could not have been old Bart . Probably they were right . Yet , just as long as the wind rustled through the pines , folks would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the linen duster , old Black Bart , the Po 8 , trudging his amazing way through the forest . A great deal of acrimonious controversy arose between Hume of Wells Fargo and some of the San Francisco newspapers . Particularly the Examiner , which seemed to be a bit peeved because Hume had not consulted it in advance before proceeding against Black Bart . Whispers began to go around San Francisco that Hume and Morse had made a deal with Bart to leave Wells Fargo coaches alone in the future . This repeatedly was denied . San Franciscans kept saying : " Of  | course , Wells , Fargo and Company had to pay him a salary for the rest of his life , or none of their stages would have been safe ! " Joseph Henry Jackson , in his Tintypes in Gold , ridicules these statements explicitly , saying : Why , if Wells , Fargo was paying Bart a salary to be good , did Mr. Hume spend his company 's money on printing an elaborate notice for his agents , complete with Bart 's picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Bart subsidy , flatly denied by everyone who was in a position to know , has no solid foundation whatever . It started no one knew where . It grew as such tales do ; it took root and has become firmly fixed as part of the Black Bart legend . But it dies harder than any of the false statements that have been made about Bart . There is nothing people hate so much as having their fairy tales taken away from them . So the Black Bart tradition persisted . As late as 1897 a man , who had been arrested at Olathe , Kansas , for robbing a store , was said to be the notorious Black Bart . He confessed that he actually was Bart . And Johnnie Thacker went out to Kansas to investigate . One look at the faker convinced the old Wells Fargo policeman . " He is as much like Black Bart , " said Thacker , " as a bird 's nest is like a mile post . " Afterwards Thacker said that he knew Bart was out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Which may , or may not , have been so .  | John J. Valentine has appeared in the foregoing pages from time to time as he fought his way up from the ranks in Wells Fargo . We have seen how , as a Wells Fargo employee traveling dead head on a stagecoach he once fought his way through a raging snowstorm in the Sierras to deliver the mail on foot . Reference has been made to him as he served the company in more responsible capacities through a period of thirty years . Born south of the Ohio in Bowling Green , Kentucky , in  | the ' forties , he first came to work for Wells Fargo as a clerk in its Virginia City office in 1860 . Before coming West he had had some experience in the Adams Express Office in Bowling Green . He liked the business and gradually he rose to the top . In 1862 , he was Wells Fargo agent at Strawberry Valley ; later he was agent and superintendent of the Pioneer Stage Company which Wells Fargo had bought in 1864 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , cashier at San Francisco , Superintendent of Wells Fargo 's California &; Oregon Stage Company , in 1869 he was made general manager . In 1882 Valentine became general manager , then vicepresident . Finally in 1892 he was made president of the firm which he had served for more than thirty years . Thus Valentine was known in all San Francisco as an outstanding man of Wells Fargo , and the city heartily agreed that the honor and responsibility that he had won were well merited . Valentine was a thoroughgoing expressman . Moreover , he looked the part for the time and region . He was bearded and stood six-foot-four inches in the boots which he always wore in place of shoes . While the company came first in his thoughts and loyalties , his second love was his library in his beautiful Oakland home . He also liked writing and writers . He knew many , among them John Greenleaf Whittier , who dedicated one of his poems to him . John Valentine handled many cases of train and stagecoach robbery . He was in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case which was solved quickly and successfully . But one case of robbery , involving $100,000 was solved unsuccessfully . That case concerned Charles W. Banks . Before we go on , let me set the stage a bit . From 1912 until 1918 I was advertising manager of Wells , Fargo and Company . I had been working for the company a little over a year when a young man came into my office on lower Broadway , New York , and put a manuscript into my hands . His name was Parker Gilbert and he was the son of a colonel in the United States Army who had once commanded the famous Ninth Regiment of artillery when it was stationed at Madison Barracks , just outside my home in Watertown , New York . Young Gilbert was of a roving nature . Destined for  | success , he laid a firm foundation for it by becoming an enthusiastic world traveler ; round the world trips were his special delight . On one of his trips , on a small steamer bound from New Zealand to San Francisco , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of the Cook Islands group . Ordinarily the ship would put in there for a few hours only ; the passengers would go ashore at Amara in small boats and return , either thoroughly delighted or thoroughly disgusted . Gilbert got the urge to stop over and catch the next ship to San Francisco . He spoke of this plan to the captain of the ship who tried his best to dissuade him . Gilbert , however , managed to miss his ship and he remained in Rarotanga until the next one came along , about thirty days later . During his stay he prepared a fairly extensive manuscript on the island . That was the manuscript he asked me to read . After I read it I asked young Gilbert several questions about the island . I also asked him if he were the only white man on the island . He replied that he was and then , after thinking over the question replied : " Oh , yes , there was another : an old fellow from San Francisco . His name was Banks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco ? " " Yes , and he told me that San Francisco did not agree with him . " " Mr. Banks was quite right , " I answered . So I told Gilbert about Banks and how he came to leave San Francisco . In the decades before the earthquake , San Francisco was a gay and colorful city and the officers of Wells Fargo played a pleasant part in it . In this brisk coterie there was none more popular than Charlie Banks , the dashing and gay cashier . He moved high , wide and handsome . He belonged to the best clubs , as did most of the younger officers of the company , the Bohemian , the Union , the San Francisco Art Association and he mixed with all the " best " people . But handsome , full-bearded Charlie Banks had a distinction that was not shared by all of his fellow officers . He had a reputation as an " intellectual . " In addition he owned the only oil-immersed microscope west of the Mississippi River which he generously lent to the scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return he was elected an honorary member of all of them . Early in 1887 he went to Lloyd Tevis , president of Wells Fargo , and asked him if he could take an extra day or two off over the coming weekend to do some fishing in the Russian River country . Take three or four days , if you wish , Charlie , " said Tevis . " You 've been working pretty hard of late and the change will do you good. ? When , at the end of the week Banks had not returned from his trip , inspectors were put to work on his books . They found that he had got away with somewhere between eighty and one hundred thousand dollars ! Consternation reigned on Montgomery Street . It seemed all hut impossible that an honored and trusted officer of Wells , Farg ? and Company , financial Gibraltar of San Francisco , should have absconded with funds of the company . Lloyd Tevis and John J. Valentine shuddered , the other officers of Wells Fargo were astounded . One thing was made clear ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There must be nothing in the newspapers , not even whispered gossip along Montgomery Street . No one must even dream that anything had gone the least bit wrong in the sacred home of the fat cat . Lloyd Tevis , as he did when anything very difficult came up , placed the entire business in the capable hands of John J. Valentine . Valentine in turn sent for James B Hume. wj his time you have to find your man , and find him quickly , " he said to the company detective . " No delay , no publicity Just get hold of Charlie Banks at once and bring him here , He is somewhere here in San Francisco . He 's probably shaved off his beard and must look different . But even so , you can tell him by his eyes and brow . " Home had the temerity to disagree with his chief . " We 've already searched the whole town , " he told the general manager of Wells Fargo . " He 's not in San Francisco . I 'm sure of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's on a ship bound for the south seas , " was Hume 's quiet reply . " Three of them sailed the day after Charlie was supposed to have gone fishing up in the Russian River . My private opinion is that he might have shipped on the Star of India last Saturday and that sooner or later he will turn up in the Cook Islands or some other place where we can not reach him by extradition . " " Nonsense , " said Valentine . " You keep right on trying to locate him here in San Francisco , Captain Hume . " Another week went by , a fortnight , three weeks . Again Valentine sent for Hume , reminded him that it was about time that Charlie Banks , erstwhile cashier of Wells , Fargo and Company 's Express , was apprehended and turned over to the police . Hume reddened . " I 'll stick to my statement , Mr. Valentine . " But John J. Valentine was not satisfied . " Do I have to send for Pinkerton ? " Hume 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he can do anything that we can not do in our own organization ? " There was silence for a minute or two until Hume spoke again . " I wish that you would call in your stenographer , Mr. Valentine , and please dictate two letters , written without date . One will be from me to you , tendering my resignation as head of the Wells Fargo police service , a post of which I am very proud . The other will be from you to me and it will be a letter of apology . Give me three months more and then one of the two letters will be dated , signed and mailed . " Valentine agreed . Three months later he mailed Captain Hume the letter of apology . Banks had turned up in Rarotanga . He had not , however , sailed on the Star of India , but on a tramp barkentine , the City of Papeete . Her skipper , Captain Baruda , when he returned to San Francisco reported that on that memorable Saturday he had had an unexpected passenger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sailed with him as far as Australia . " A lovely fellow , " added Baruda . Hume produced photographs of the former cashier .  | " That 's him all right , " said the ship 's master . " That 's the way he must have looked before he shaved his beard . A good-looking fellow , with or without the beard . He was one of the pleasantest chaps I ever knew . And one of the most generous . He gave every man aboard five dollars as we crossed the equator . " Gradually the whole story leaked out , until it was common knowledge not only in San Francisco but elsewhere . Wells Fargo , badly nettled , sent detectives to get Banks , but they returned empty-handed . Banks had found refuge on the island of Rarotanga , from which there was no extradition . Wells Fargo finally gave up the hunt . For a time it was rumored that any ship captain who could shanghai Banks and bring him back to San Francisco , dead or alive , would receive a handsome cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. Banks lived the rest of his years in Rarotanga . From his little cottage on the beach he could look out on the same ocean which touched the shores of California and yet he was never to be able to return to the city and people he loved . That was to be his punishment . From time to time the more sensational newspapers in San Francisco vied with one another in printing lurid and fantastic tales about Banks in Rarotanga . They said that he had married Queen Matea and then , at another time , that he had married one of the princesses . The Sunday Examiner delighted in fourcolumn cuts , showing Banks gnawing at a human thighbone . They did n't indicate whether it belonged to the Queen or one of the princesses . At any rate none of these stories was true . I asked Parker Gilbert about Banks , how he lived , and what were his sources of income . He drew a small pension as South Seas representative of a Bristol , England , trading company and , in addition , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his beard and remained , as always , an omnivorous reader . He corresponded , at intervals , with some of the Wells Fargo oldtimers who posted him on the news . Everyone liked Charlie Banks . Even John J. Valentine liked him . In the black hour that immediately preceded the dawn of October 11 , 1894 , two masked men halted the Overland Ex- press just two miles outside Sacramento . At rifle point they forced the engineer and the fireman to detach the locomotive and the express car from the rest of the train and to move it forward . Then the bandits got into the express car and , catching the messenger off guard , bound him hand and foot . They then looted the car at their leisure . The prize was $51,000 in gold . In all the history of train robbery no one had succeeded in capturing so large a haul . Just in terms of weight , the gold was over 200 pounds . It was a troublesome load and so , after getting the gold out of the express car and sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered what they should do with it . In a brief time it would be known all over Sacramento that the Central Pacific Overland Express had been held up and plundered . Posses would be scouring the countryside for the men and , with their heavy load , it would be , an easy matter to catch up with them . So , as the fog and darkness gave way to the dim early morning , the two men dug a deep hole , not far from the point of the hold-up . Into this hole they dropped their loot and quickly covered it with the soft , fresh earth . They marked the spot in their memory , sprang quickly to their horses and rode away . As they did so , a man crept out of the fog and feverishly began to remove the earth from the hole they had just filled . If the state of California considered that its reputation for law and order and the protection of property had been violated , how about Wells Fargo whose express lines criss-crossed the entire state ? It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold or make up the loss ? as it always had . There was , in addition , a matter of reputation . For forty years it had been said throughout the West that there were two institutions dangerous for bad men to tinker with . One was the Federal Government and the other , Wells Fargo . This Sacramento robbery was not the Government 's affair but the company 's . Moreover , it was the worst of a group of robberies . Within a few months , two of the express company 's messengers had been killed in defense of its treasure . This robbery was the last straw . " It 's a job for Jimmie Hume , " said John Valentine . " It will be about the biggest job he 's ever tackled , " he added .  | The two men who had held up the train returned to the spot where they had buried the gold . They dug all about the area but did n't find it . When , after repeated attempts to locate the gold , they realized that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few months later , they held up another train , not far from Redding . This was to be a complete job . The first of the bandits , named Browning , tackled the express car while the other , Brady , went into the sleeping cars . The passengers tumbled out of their berths , held up their hands while Brady removed their watches and wallets . One man , whom novelists might describe as " big and upstanding , " said that he would die rather than surrender his valuables to the outlaw . He was the sheriff of Tehama County and he had a reputation to maintain . He maintained it , for he died with his boots on , in the aisle of the Pullman sleeper . But the outlaw who killed him paid the price for his crime right there . The rest of the passengers took courage from the sheriff , fell on the murderer and filled his body with bullets . The other bandit heard the commotion in the sleeping car and quickly rode off into the brake , leaving his booty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hume in San Francisco and he hurried up to Redding . He proceeded to the scene of the crime and then he left it and rode off in search of the second bandit . He was gone for three days and , when he returned , it was with Jack Brady 's body . He had killed the man when he resisted arrest . But , before he died Brady had made his confession . He also told Hume that the gold from the Overland had disappeared and that he and his partner never got it . Hume had known this fact all the time . By a slow , laborious painstaking method of piecing together clues , Hume had found the man who had stepped out of the fog as the bandits had gone off . This man was a tramp . His name was John D. Harms who had been born Karl Heerman in Hamburg , Germany . He admitted that he was a hobo who slept under the stars and who measured off railroad miles as his daily exercise . He had set up his tiny pup tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first robbery . Awakening just before dawn he had been disturbed by men talking beside the railroad embankment  | near by . Slowly he crept through the bushes and watched while Brady and Browning buried their gold . In their haste they made a bad job of it and , after they rode off , Harms came over and finished it for them . He made a very good job of it and later he came back and took the gold bars for himself . There were several things that Harms might have done instead . He might have reported the discovery of the gold to Wells Fargo and collected a large reward for his honesty . He might have forgotten what he saw and headed along down the tracks . But dazzled by the size of the haul , he took it and placed part of it in a bank . Then he purchased a fine , new outfit for himself , including three mustache curlers . After that he rode to New York in style and blew in $i i , 000 on wine , song and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone he returned to San Francisco and there Wells Fargo finally caught up with him . He was tried but , in the eyes of California justice of that day , his offense was not too bad and he was sentenced to only three years in Folsom Penitentiary . This case marked the practical end of train robbery in California . The empire by the Pacific had grown up . The Golden Gate had law and order . San Francisco wore spats and it took afternoon tea .  | On February ii , 1888 , the Santa Fe railway rode triumphantly into Chicago and Wells Fargo rode in with it . Less than a month later Wells , Fargo and Company completed its own through route from San Francisco to New York City by the acquisition of the Erie Express Company which operated between Chicago and Jersey City . Now Wells Fargo was a transcontinental concern indeed . At last it was in a fair position to do business in competition with its two chief rivals , the American and the Adams Express Corn- panies , neither of whom at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California . The business of growing fruit and perishable vegetables in the Southwest was just beginning in 1888 and its market was guaranteed by the swift express cars of Wells Fargo . It was Wells Fargo as a matter of course , because the company had all but a monopoly of express business in the Southwest by virtue of its contracts with both the Santa Fe and the Southern Pacific . To do business with the Santa Fe , the newly established rival of Southern Pacific , meant a diplomatic handling of S.P. with whom Wells Fargo had maintained an extremely close relationship since 1883 , and which was heavily interested in its stock . The Southern Pacific arrangement had always been a most advantageous contract for the express company and also for the Southern Pacific , which took a slice of Wells Fargo stock for itself each time it made a new contract with the express company . Under their agreement the railroad took forty per cent of the gross receipts from the express traffic , Wells Fargo the other sixty . With renewals the relation continued for years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be such contracts with the Santa Fe . In fact , when the Santa Fe fought its way into California in spite of the Southern Pacific , Wells Fargo had to have an express contract on it to keep rivals out of its territory . And Wells Fargo had to pay richly for that contract . The first contract with the Santa Fe in November , 1888 , gave fifty per cent of gross earnings to the railroad ; and , besides that , Wells Fargo had to pay in advance $1,450,000 to the Santa Fe against future payments due . The Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe started in 1868 at Topeka , Kansas . Originally incorporated as the Atchison &; Topeka , Cyrus K. Holliday , the founder , brought about the addition of " Santa Fe " to its corporate name . Having observed the rich traffic by wagon train over the Santa Fe trail , he set distant Santa Fe as the railroad 's great goal . With dogged persistence he kept steadily at it until in 1873 Kansas had been crossed , and the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop a magnificent new state of the Union , Hol- liday always kept looking westward . The dream of Santa Fe faded for a bit in favor of a shorter route west and that vision was to be a nightmare . Holliday and his chief associates , William B. Strong and Albert A. Robinson , looked with favor on the more direct route through the sharp defile of the Arkansas River in the Rockies , today known as the Royal Gorge , and thence across the Continental Divide toward the Pacific Coast . General William J. Palmer who had a railroad enterprise , the narrow-gauge Denver and Rio Grande , thought otherwise . Building across the Rockies , he also intended to use the Royal Gorge , as this breathtaking thirty-foot-wide canyon was the only notch in the forbidding rampart of the main range through which a railroad might go without seeking an easier pass very much farther south or very much farther north . Both the Santa Fe and the Rio Grande fought for that gorge . They rushed tracklaying crews toward the narrow pass . The battle that ensued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was actual hand-to-hand fighting by the rival gangs , spurred on by their energetic bosses ? and a little bloodshed . Eventually the Rio Grande won and the Santa Fe retired ? eventually to win the empire of the Southwest it controls today . The old dream of Santa Fe returned but with a change . The builders now realized that the ancient city was no longer a logical terminal for their line . The development of California , Arizona and New Mexico had changed all that . The Santa Fe now saw that it had to build its road to the Pacific , where connections with ships in the Pacific trade could be made . But entrance to California was blocked by the Southern Pacific . To see just how effective that block was , let us see what that wise old fox , Collis P. Huntington , surviving genius of the Big Four , was doing with the S.P. By 1876 the Southern Pacific tracks reached from San Francisco south to Los Angeles , in spite of the rail spirals , the tunnels and heavy grades which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push to the East . It must have seemed to the  | Santa Fe crowd that from here Huntington was foreseeing with uncanny judgment every move they would make . The Southern Pacific built rapidly eastward through the sandy desert of Southern California , the same desert which , under irrigation , was eventually to become the great citrus fruit garden of the world . With California behind , it was Arizona , New Mexico , and finally the great pass of the North through which flowed the Rio Grande . This was El Paso , at the boundary of old Mexico , and at the western end of the rails of Huntington 's Texas and Pacific . The Santa Fe , meanwhile , after its defeat in the Royal Gorge , built its line south through and over the saddle-pass of the Raton Mountain to Santa Fe ( reaching that city in February 188o ) , to Albuquerque ( a few months later ) , and through the valley of the upper Rio Grande to El Paso . But the Southern Pacific blocked the Santa Fe there , so Strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , forced to reach the Pacific somehow , turned their attention to Mexico . The State of Sonora , with its mineral resources , its rich soil for agriculture , its abundant harbors , offered a perfect area for development . The promoters of the Santa Fe knew all this , and , after studying the profile maps of Northwestern Mexico , finally chose the harbor of Guaymas in the Gulf of California as their western terminal . The quickest and most practical way for the Santa Fe to reach Guaymas was to extend its line south from Albuquerque to the Mexican border at Nogales . The Santa Fe lines reached Deming in 1882 ; and in the same year the line from Guaymas to Benson was completed . But here again was a Southern Pacific fly in the ointment . The 177 miles of existing track from Deming to Benson belonged to the S.P. Strong and Robinson knew that the S.P. would never permit them to operate an efficient railroad of heavy traffic over S.P. track . At best such an arrangement could be an expedient . Eventually it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robinson , blocked off from Mexico , now had no  | choice but to get their railroad into California in order to subdue the powerful Southern Pacific and to work out lasting arrangements with it . They began looking for another route . They found it in the Atlantic and Pacific railroad . The Atlantic &; Pacific , together with the St. Louis-San Francisco ( popularly known as the " Frisco " to all except residents of the Golden Gate city ) controlled a route along the thirty-fifth parallel of latitude from St. Louis to Needles on the California border of New Mexico . So far so good . The Santa Fe , after a battle with Jay Gould , who at one time controlled the Frisco , bought into the A. &; P. railroad . The line over this route was built from Albuquerque to Needles . Huntington had already protected his S.P. by building a branch from his main San Francisco-Los Angeles stem at Mojave due east to Needles . To reach the Pacific Coast from there the A. &.; P. would have to parallel Southern Pacific for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the magnificent harbor of San Diego would be its far western goal instead of Guaymas . San Diego hailed the announcement with joy . For years it had been seeking railroad connection with the hinterland . Once it had asked Jay Gould to build a road , but Gould had replied loftily that he never built railroads , he only bought them . To the San Diego plan Huntington finally grudgingly consented . He sold the branch line of the S.P. from Mojave to Needles to the Santa Fe , and in return the Santa Fe prepared to abandon its line to Guaymas . In this complex fashion the old problem of Santa Fe 's trackage from Benson to Deming was finally ironed out . Santa Fe now proceeded with seven-league boots . A line from Barstow in Southern California was quickly built to San Bernardino ( forever known to railroad men as San Berdoo ) , through to the Pacific coastal plain at Fallbrook , and so to San Diego . San Diego was wild with joy when the first through train for the East ran out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 16 , 1885 . It was a truly historic date for the Santa Fe as well . They had reached the Pacific with their own track ? all the way .  | By 1888 , the Santa Fe had its own track into Los Angeles , leaving its earliest line ( the Southern California ) at Riverside and going through Corona and Fullerton to the City of the Angels , entering from the southwest . This line was preceded by another into Los Angeles from the south . In the autumn of 1885 the small Los Angeles and San Gabriel Railroad already had reached Pasadena and was being hurried through to San Berdoo and connection with the Santa Fe . The boom was on ! Small new towns sprang up as if by magic for seventy miles east of Los Angeles ; the modern miracle of irrigation was being wrought and fortunes were in the making . The Los Angeles &; San Gabriel , like the Southern California , became part and parcel of the Atchison , Topeka &; Santa Fe , with the result that the Santa Fe now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Angels . All of these things mattered much to Wells Fargo , carrying express as it did on the trains of the rival railroad systems . Wells Fargo helped to form a triumvirate that in those days ( long before the coming of the improved highway and the motor truck ) created a virtual monopoly of transport in California . As such it was not infrequently and bitterly criticized . Out of this bitterness eventually came the San Francisco &; San Joaquin Valley Railroad from Oakland to Bakersfield , which was promoted as a " people 's railroad " in 1895 . But in 1896 this line was taken over by the Santa Fe . This was the line that finally gave Santa Fe its long delayed entrance into San Francisco . Operating west from Barstow on the main stem , it used its own rails as far as Mojave , then those of the Southern Pacific over the Tehachapi Pass to Bakersfield ; again its own rails to Stockton and to Oakland . At Richmond , thirty miles north of Oakland , Santa Fe established its own ferry service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right into the ferryhouse at the foot of Market Street , San Francisco , later to be superseded by a bus connection from Oakland over the Bay Bridge to the downtown heart of San Francisco . If I have lingered upon this long-continued conflict between Southern Pacific and Santa Fe , it has been to establish the proper background for the vast prosperity that came to all  | California with the coming of the railroads . Inasmuch as Wells , Fargo and Company had exclusive contracts with both of the oads , it made apparently but little difference to it which of the two transported its high-value freight ? the point was that Wells Fargo retained its priceless monopoly in the tremendous state 9f California . This maintaining a balance between two rival roads was something that called for a vast deal of tact and diplomacy on the part of the operating heads of Wells Fargo ; an increasing problem it became . The two systems were at all times the bitterest of competitors . The battle between them brought to a head a most interesting problem . When two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the express be divided between them ; in what proportions ? The railroads derived their income from the express in direct proportion both to the tonnage and the distance hauled . They were all jealous and demanding . To humor them required no end of patience on the part of the express executives . It was not until about the turn of the century that other roads alien to Wells Fargo were to enter the Golden State . Back in the late ' seventies rail connection finally was established between San Francisco ( Oakland Mole ) and Oregon . The line to Portland ran over the steep Siskiyou Pass ; many years later a line of far easier gradients was established by way of Klamath Falls and the Siskiyou route was all but abandoned . Portland itself became a railroad center and a Wells Fargo point of considerable importance . The company maintained a bank there , as well as an express office , and built for itself the splendid Wells Fargo building which still stands . That husky old stager , Ben Holladay , had joined forces with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a railroad system , at first pushed up the valley of the Willamette , was begun in the pioneer American state upon the West Coast . It was at first known as the Oregon Railway &; Navigation Company and eventually it reached south to the California line and joined forces with the Central Pacific , reaching north from Sacramento . It was this small line that a traveling journalist , Henry Vil- lard , stumbled upon on his first trip into the rich Oregon country . He was so impressed that he secured control and prepared to use it as the terminal of the transcontinental line struggling to find a pathway for itself across the northern tier of the United States all the way from Duluth , at the head of the navigable Great Lakes , to Puget Sound . This was the Northern Pacific , an enterprise conceived by a dreamer in Boston in Civil War days ? Josiah Perham . The Northern Pacific had had a gift of 47,000,000 acres of superb land dropped into its lap by charter from a magnificently mad United States Congress . Perham soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd " ? the Fargos and the Barneys and William B. Dinsmore and the Vermont Central 's Smiths ? took over the budding railroad . That highly picturesque financier , Jay Cooke of Philadelphia , came into the scene , and had it not been for the panic of 1873 , for which Cooke was partly responsible , they would have built it at once through to Tacoma , the terminal city first chosen by its founders . It took the indomitable Villard to complete the road , even though it nearly bankrupted him to do it . As a pioneer terminal for Northern Pacific he chose Portland , where he was already in control of the Oregon Railway and Navigation line ; at a later time it was to extend north to Tacoma , first from Portland and then , at a still later time , Seattle , which until the days of the Klondike rush was a sleepy fishing village . Still later Northern Pacific built a direct entrance to Seattle , across the newly formed territory of Washington . The Oregon Railway and Navigation Company south of Portland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and absorbed the Central Pacific . Its line up in the south bank of the Columbia , from Portland through the Dalles and well beyond became known as the Oregon-Washington Railway &; Navigation Company ; later , in connection with the Oregon Short Line , it became the far western extension of the Union Pacific railroad up into the Pacific Northwest . At about the same time Union Pacific finally invaded sacred California by taking over the Los Angeles-Salt Lake Railroad which Senator William A. Clark of Montana finally succeeded in  | building between those two cities . Not only that but the shrewd Montanan had established trackage rights for his new road for just an even 100 miles over the Santa Fe through the difficult Cajon Pass from a point just east of Barstow . At Riverside the Union Pacific went again upon its own tracks into Los Angeles . Wells Fargo never operated on the Union Pacific , although as will be seen in due course , it was of supreme aid in financing the rebuilding of that key railroad of the Union . For a time , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific , but lost that shortly after the completion of the Villard transcontinental road . There was a bitter fight over the matter which went into the courts , but the powerful Wells Fargo lost , and it was not until a quarter of a century later that Wells , Fargo and Company had its own express route across the northern tier , and then it was over the remarkable extension to Puget Sound of the Chicago , Milwaukee &; St. Paul Railway . Wells Fargo in 1909 rode the Milwaukee from Chicago and St. Paul into Seattle and so rounded out its western coverage in the Northest . At about the same time that the Union Pacific took over the Los Angeles &; Salt Lake and entered Los Angeles rather dramatically , another free-booting railroad forced itself into San Francisco from the East . This was one of the final Gould enterprises ? the Western Pacific , all the way from Salt Lake City across central Nevada and through the Feather River pass to Sacramento , Stockton and its own ferryhouse at Oakland . This road , built as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the pet hope and pride of Jay Gould 's son , George . It was supposed to have had the support of the Hill roads , although James J. Hill himself once bitterly denied this to me . Western Pacific finally made traffic arrangements with Southern Pacific , so that the two single-track roads across Nevada were operated as a double-track line , to their mutual advantage . Wells Fargo never operated on that line . To the contrary , one of the company 's competitors , the American Express Company , finally reached into San Francisco over it ( it had entered Los Angeles a few years before on the Union Pacific ) , and the Wells Fargo monopoly in the city by the Golden  | Gate , extending for more than half a century , was finally broken , although Wells , Fargo and Company still retained the vast bulk of express business of the town . San Francisco was a t Wells Fargo town ? its sympathies and its interests were with the company that had grown up there . When San Franciscans wished to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wells Fargo , please . " Even after Wells Fargo had expanded to a vast system with many thousands of employees , extending all the way across the continent , it still did thirty-five per cent of its business in California . In the early spring of 1888 , as I said at the beginning of this chapter , the Santa Fe rode into Chicago , Wells Fargo with it . For some years Santa Fe had been itching to get itself into the chief railroad hub of North America . The three railroads already in operation between the Missouri and the Great Lakes , the Rock Island , the Burlington , and the Chicago &; Alton , fought for the traffic from this territory for the Soo-mile haul up to Chicago . Yet the first two of these roads began to invade Kansas , and this the Santa Fe resented . More than this , the Santa Fe very well knew that if it remained with its eastern terminal at Kansas City it would continue merely as a " bridge road . " This , to William B. Strong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for a long time its dominating force , became president of the Santa Fe in 1873 . An aggressive man always , he sought to bring his line , at last secure in its entrance to California , right into the great metropolis of the Middle West . Strong was the sort of man who , once he had made his decision , did something about it . Rejecting a suggestion to buy the Chicago and Alton ( at that time both rich and proud ) he decided that Santa Fe would build its own direct line from Kansas City to Chicago . Decision gave way to immediate action . At once surveying parties went into the field . With the exception of the first hundred miles out of Chicago where Santa Fe picked up at a bargain the struggling little Chicago &; St. Louis line , it was to be all new track . As nearly airline as possible ( when finished it was 450 miles long ) , it would be the shortest route between Kansas City and Chicago . Intermediate towns were not essential to the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " bridge " between Chicago and Kansas City , designed chiefly to handle through traffic rather than local . Two enterprising towns , Galesburg , Illinois , and Keokuk , Iowa , fought to be on the new line . Galesburg , with a proffer of a handsome new station and a right of way , won . Never was a line more rapidly or better built than that extension of the Santa Fe into Chicago . Despite the fact that five great bridges had to be erected for it and much other heavy construction done , the 350 miles of brand-new line were finished in nine months of 1887 , in addition to the rebuilding of the rickety Chicago &; St. Louis . Final opening of the line was delayed awaiting the completion of the 4000-foot bridge over the Missouri at Sibley , twenty-five miles east of Kansas City . But this delay was inconsequential . On February 11 , 1888 , Wells Fargo rode the first through Santa Fe train into Chicago . On March 11th , a month later , it at last was in its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time for the Great Blizzard of 1888 which raged into the city-one day later . Tremendous advance preparations had been made for that arrival . Wells , Fargo and Company had taken over the plant of the erstwhile Erie Express Company and it already was placing its signs and its call-cards along the entire length of the New York , Lake Erie &; Western Railway , as Erie was then known . The invasion of New York and of Chicago meant that a large and aggressive new Wells Fargo organization had to be built up at once in each city , including local and depot offices and the operation of a great fleet of horses and wagons ( all this was before the coming of the motor truck ) requiring many shops , warehouses and stables . In New York the street flotilla was to consist eventually of over four hundred trucks and wagons and nearly twice that number of horses ; in Chicago it came to more than half that number . Yet when the first Santa Fe passenger station was established in Chicago , December 1 , 1887 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South California and Blue Island Avenues , Wells Fargo agent Anson Gordon had to get along as best he could with a street equipment of six wagons and eight horses . Wells Fargo grew rapidly in the unfamiliar East . By May  | of the following year the handsome new Dearborn passenger station , close to the downtown Loop , had been opened as the Chicago terminal of both the Santa Fe and the Erie systems , as well as of the Wabash , the Monon and the Grand Trunk . Gradually , Wells Fargo was installed on the first three of these railroads and the fact that they shared a common terminal in Chicago was of vast assistance in the swift operation of through transcontinental express . Horses and wagons aplenty came to supplement the original equipment . The Wells Fargo tradition of acquiring fine horseflesh started by the McLanes was splendidly maintained . Over the Erie each night out of Jersey City ran two of the fastest trains on the road , Number Nine and Number Thirteen . At Dearborn Station , to old expressmen always " Polk Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seven , lately named the Fargo Fast , one of the swiftest and bestnamed railroad trains in all the land . Anson Gordon was General Agent of Wells Fargo at Chicago for seven busy years . On his death in 1895 he was immediately succeeded by his assistant , Bernard Wygant , who for thirteen more years was an outstanding figure in the commercial life of Chicago . In the meantime the operating headquarters of Wells Fargo for the central portion of what was becoming a real express empire were being established in Chicago ; while the local headquarters of the company were at 154 Dearborn Street , general headquarters were finally located in the Harris Trust Company in West Monroe Street . Here reigned for years the genial and efficient Emory A. Stedman , who , as assistant superintendent of Wells Fargo , had ridden into Chicago in the spring of 1888 and who remained there for thirty years , rising to be the vice-president and general manager for the entire central and eastern sections of Wells Fargo . When Wells Fargo 's entrance to Chicago was limited to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were concentrated at " Polk Street , " but in later years , with the company 's acquisition of express rights on the Milwaukee , the Chicago Great Western , the Wabash and the Baltimore and Ohio , it  | expanded into two other passenger terminals , the Union Station and the Grand Central . Wells Fargo 's route to New York City on the Erie was not the most direct route between New York and Chicago , but the Erie was then , as now , a well-operated , dependable railroad , and the affiliation between it and Wells Fargo , once established , continued for many years . The situation in New York itself was complicated by the fact that the Hudson River was a barrier between the passenger terminals of the Erie in Jersey and Manhattan . But the swift and efficient operation of a large fleet of ferryboats across the Hudson to terminals at the foot of Chambers Street and West Twenty-Third Street on the west side of Manhattan largely overcame this barrier . The chief Wells Fargo city office in New York had been established for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before that at 84 Broadway ) until finally it was moved a few doors further down that street to Numbers 49 and 51 . Manhattan and Brooklyn also were served by a number of city branch offices . New York was a city of tremendous potentialities for Wells Fargo and it worked vigorously , once it had arrived in the metropolis , to build up a large traffic . Against long-established competition it put up a stiff and successful fight . The company had only one road into New York , the Erie , but west of Chicago it could offer its customers transport on a number of lines , not the least of them the tracks of the Santa Fe , now " all the way " to Wells Fargo 's home city of San Francisco .  | Throughout the entire final quarter of the past century and well into the beginning of the present one , Wells , Fargo and N. Company continued to expand its express activities . At the same time the banking department of the company prospered mightily . These two major activities of the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . As the business of the company grew , the stoutly built castle of Chinese stone that John Parrott had erected long ago at Montgomery and California Streets became outmoded , and the bank moved to  | Sansome Street , where under the skillful guidance of Homer S. King , it continued its operations . Four years after the Santa Fe contracted with the company for exclusive express privileges over its line , Wells Fargo was operating , among others , over the following rather extensive system of railroads in the United States and Mexico : St. Paul &; Omaha Sioux City &; Pacific Southern Pacific System Atchison , Topeka &; Santa Fe Denver &; Rio Grande Atlantic &; Pacific Mexican Central Sonora Railroad Company A good many of these names have long since disappeared from the railroad guides but in their day they were enterprising roads . Most of them , as can be seen from their names , were headed for California . This vast expansion was recognized by president Lloyd Tevis when , on March 13 , 1884 , he made E. N. Cooper general superintendent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco , and W. J. Hancock general superintendent of the eastern department with his headquarters at Omaha . The title of general manager for these departments had not yet been adopted . But a little later John J. Valentine was made general manager of the entire Wells Fargo Express enterprise with Cooper and Hancock reporting to him . The company continued to pay its eight per cent dividends annually and , after that , to push its huge undivided profits into the vaults of the company bank . Homer King took good care that these were properly protected . The contract , dated November 1 , 1888 , which Wells Fargo secured with the Atchison Topeka &; Santa Fe established a fifty-fifty division of gross earnings . There was a guarantee of not less than $15o a mile annually for express earnings on the main line of the Santa Fe and $6o a mile on branch lines . The contract also applied to the various subsidiary Santa Fe lines , including the Gulf , Colorado &; Santa Fe operating in Texas and which , under the laws of that commonwealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with headquarters in the Lone Star State .  | The company in 1892 owned and operated 2,829 offices and agencies . The annual dividends were beginning occasionally to drop from eight to six per cent a year . In the autumn of 1893 a new contract was made with the Southern Pacific for all the lines of the system and the San Antonio and Aransas Pass , which was brought into the S.P. system at a slightly later date . The terms of this important contract were that Wells Fargo was to pay forty per cent of the gross earnings . For such a juicy prize the company put up $1,750,000 in stock . Earlier that year Wells Fargo had renewed its old contract with the Santa Fe at fifty per cent of the gross , but that contract called for an advance of $1,450,000 on the part of Wells , Fargo and Company . The fat cat of Montgomery Street must have groaned a bit that year as he gave up so much of his hoardings . In 1897 Wells Fargo began a ten-year contract with the St. Louis &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought Wells , Fargo and Company for the first time on a through route into the important city of St. Louis . A superintendent 's office was established in the Continental Bank Building , and Grover B. Simpson , whose name was to be identified with Wells Fargo for the next quarter of a century , was placed in charge . Later Simpson went to Chicago to become a general superintendent of Wells Fargo and was succeeded in turn by C. R. Teas and H. B. Calkins ? names also to become well known on the roster of Wells , Fargo and Company . Meanwhile , the company decided to pull out of the old Montgomery Street building entirely and to erect a modern office of its own . A convenient site was chosen at the corner of Second and Mission Streets , almost within a stone 's throw of the Palace Hotel , and there , in 1898 , it moved its activities . Wells Fargo at last had a home of its own of which it might be proud . On August 11 , 1892 , Lloyd Tevis retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had trained so long and so arduously . Tevis remained on the Board of Directors with Leland Stanford , James C. Fargo , Charles C. Crocker and others . Valentine had been a long time getting the post of presidency , but he was to hold it only a little more than  | eight years . But all of the last forty years of his life he worked faithfully for Wells Fargo , and , on December 21 , 1901 , he died . It had been in very many ways a hard world for him ? a world of many disappointments , of robbers and of highwaymen , not all of whom toted guns . But through all of it he kept his faith and his honor . John Valentine at his death was only a little over sixty-three years old , a man retaining still his fire and his energy if not his physical vigor . In his passing Wells Fargo suffered an almost irreparable loss . He was mourned in San Francisco and far beyond as were but few men of his day and generation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banditry was subsiding . Occasionally there was a sporadic outburst , but always it was short-lived . Picturesque sheriffs were becoming story-book idylls . Wells Fargo had played its full part in subduing these criminals and it was entitled to more credit for the job than it sometimes received . Jimmie Hume and Johnnie Thacker knew it and so did their fine and grizzled chief , John J. Valentine . The growth of the West and the Southwest , which we have sketched in by noting the extension of the railroads through the country , brought immense opportunities for the growth of the express , which we have given , by necessity , pretty much in terms of new contracts for Wells Fargo . Back of each of these , however , there is a story of hard work and toil , of the people who settled and built up the great West and Southwest and of the agents of the express who made that growth possible . Take as an example of the whole story the tremendous agricultural growth of Southern California and Arizona following the development of irrigation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its men played , the story of Dudley T. Mervine . Mr. Mervine is one of the oldest Wells Fargo officials still living , at present writing well and happy . He is a typical oldtime Wells Fargo man . I shall not embarrass him by giving his age , but will mention the fact that but a short time ago in his pleasant home at La Grange , Illinois , Mrs. Mervine and  | he celebrated the sixty-fifth anniversary of their marriage . He is one of the very few Wells Fargo men still living who remembers John J. Valentine . He knew Dudley Evans , Aaron and Nathan Steins , Homer King , William Pridham , Andrew Christeson , Emory Stedman and Charlie Gardiner , all those gallant knights of the old Wells Fargo days . He remembers when Elmer Jones ( whom we shall hear much about later ) first came to work for the company . He was Elmer 's first employer . Dudley Mervine came originally from a small town in Northern Pennsylvania . He started work in a Pennsylvania railroad signal tower , took up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West Shore Railroad . " I guess I got that Horace Greeley feeling about Go West , young man , ' " he told me a few years ago . " I read how they were building the Santa Fe and I made up my mind that the best thing to do was to marry the sweetest girl in the world , and take her out with me . Which was the very thing I did . I wired the Santa Fe and they told me to come on out and work for them . " We arrived at the brand-new town of Carbondale , Kansas , and within twenty-four hours I was tapping the key in the Santa Fe station there . Not long after that I was the night agent at Carbondale and somehow I felt as if I had been working for the Santa Fe all my life . I was that proud of the road . As a side job I held down the Wells Fargo agency . " One night , when I was alone on the trick , a man came in and sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy brown paper to some town out in Ohio . I received it and issued a receipt for it . But when the package was received back East there was nothing in it but a bundle of newspaper clippings , cut to the same size as paper money . Wells Fargo got pretty excited about that . Mr. Valentine heard about it and sent Captain Hume out on the job . Hume never found the thief or the money , but he was convinced that the theft had occurred on the line somewhere and apparently he liked the way that I had behaved in the matter . Anyway pretty soon Wells Fargo superintendent Campbell up at Kansas City asked me if I did  | not want to give all my time to Wells Fargo and be a route agent , which was a job pretty much coveted in those days . " Mervine took that job in 1888 . A little later he was chief clerk , then assistant to the superintendent at Kansas City . With a passion for hard work and detail , within four years he was sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this while John J. Valentine , back in San Francisco , was watching young Mervine and finally Valentine wrote him that he wanted someone who was observing and responsible to make a general investigation of Wells Fargo conditions in the United States , Cuba , Mexico and Alaska . Mervine accepted the post gleefully and made a thorough job of it , with the result that in 1895 he was made superintendent of Wells , Fargo and Company at Kansas City , where he remained from 1895 to 1911 . But by 1911 , as presently will be seen , a good many things had happened at Wells , Fargo and Company . John J. Valentine was ten years gone and so was Dudley Evans . There was a new president of Wells Fargo , William Sproule , a shrewd , upstanding and very able man . A man of vision , Sproule decided that the time had come for Wells Fargo to have a transportation department . He also decided that D. T. Mervine was the man to head that department with jurisdiction over all the widespread system . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . As I have said , it was a long time after the development of the Southwest that it became self-supporting . Before the day of widespread irrigation the country could not raise the food it consumed and most of the green vegetables and the fruit for New Mexico and Arizona had to be shipped in . In ordinary transport ( none was swift ) in such a hot climate , there was much spoilage . The railroads had already adopted the refrigerator car for their freight service , but it was notoriously slow and undependable . D. T. Mervine had an idea and put it into effect . He worked with the Santa Fe operating people and got them to set aside  | a baggage car , fit it with large refrigerators and then to place it in service in passenger trains , which could be relied upon to make their schedules . The idea was an instant success . The new car went into service between Kansas City ( then the eastern terminus of the Santa Fe ) and Phoenix and Tucson . From the beginning it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perishable vegetables and fruit . Soon it was doing over $1,000 business a trip , of which a generous $500 went into the coffers of Wells Fargo . Soon the Santa Fe , and then the Southern Pacific , were rigging up still more baggage cars for Wells Fargo passenger train service . The plan was extended to Southern California for citrus fruits , to Rocky Ford , Colorado , for melons , to Arkansas for peaches and strawberries , and to the vast growing areas of Southern Texas and of Louisiana . A vast new field for the express had been created . For the regular and high-volume movement of meats and poultry and fruit and perishable vegetables , the refrigerator car in freight-train service would continue to carry the bulk of the traffic , but for out-of-season produce there was plenty of room , and still is , for the express . The railroads were in many instances unable to finance the large quantities of new and expensive refrigerator cars , properly equipped for handling in fast passenger trains and so Wells Fargo , always with plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leasing them to the roads on a mileage basis . By 1918 Wells Fargo had 175 refrigerator cars of its own and they were the finest in the land . I have mentioned several times before the fact that Wells Fargo always had plenty of capital on hand for financing expansion and for purchasing the lucrative contracts of so many Western railroads . With the express and banking departments moving hand in hand , they formed a perfect team for the work of building a mighty business . Not only that but , as we have seen , that team took its part in developing the resources of the country through supplying fast and reliable transportation for its products . Yet there was a young broker in Wall Street whose  | shadow was in due course to fall across Wells Fargo and make profound changes in its destiny . That young man was Edward H. Harriman . We must go back a decade or so before the turn of the century to get the sequence of such far-reaching events . The son of an Episcopalian minister , Harriman married into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became interested in the railroads of that district , among them a little line not sixty miles long which ran from the terminus of the old Northern Central ( long since become part of the Pennsylvania system ) from Stanley in Ontario County , straight north to Sodus Bay on the south shore of Lake Ontario . Harriman obtained control and went down to Broad Street Station , Philadelphia , to see President A. J. Cassatt . Here was a fine chance , said Harriman , for the Pennsylvania to develop heavy tonnage for its Northern Central line . There was a magnificent , protected harbor at Sodus , and it would be easy enough to develop a fine export coal traffic right across Ontario and down the St. Lawrence to Canada , which was an increasing market for bituminous coal . Cassatt got the picture , and he got the road . Harriman cleaned up a neat profit and launched one of the most spectacular careers of American finance . At an early age he was able to buy a seat on the New York Stock Exchange and immediately immersed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friendship with Stuyvesant Fish , he became vice-president of the Illinois Central in 1883 and twenty years later gained control of that railroad . This was his first great triumph as a financial manipulator , and from that it was a short step to his predatory dream of empire . With the aid of Kuhn , Loeb &; Company , he formed a syndicate to acquire the Union Pacific , then in receivership and looked upon as a hopeless failure . This was in 1898 and his plans were well made . He saw the Union Pacific as the key railroad for his transcontinental system from the Atlantic to the Pacific . The Illinois Central would link Omaha and Council Bluffs with Chicago . For the link to the Atlantic he con- templated either the Erie or the Baltimore and Ohio ; possibly , with luck and an extension of his wizardry , the New York Central . However , before he could engage in the titanic battle for Eastern supremacy , he had to consolidate the Western link from the Missouri to San Francisco . Having under his control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the next job was to acquire the Central Pacific from Ogden to San Francisco . That line , by this time , was a part of the Southern Pacific system controlled by Collis P. Huntington . The latter 's death in 190I gave Harriman his opportunity . Huntington had left to his widow and a nephew , Henry E. Huntington , 475,000 shares of Southern Pacific stock , the chief single interest in the company , representing forty-seven per cent of the entire outstanding capital stock . Gradually Harriman acquired this stock and gained control . Now he held both the Union Pacific and the Southern Pacific and therefore had his transcontinental chain complete from Omaha to San Francisco . However , Harriman 's operations did not stop here because , not satisfied with one transcontinental line , he entered into a contest with James J. Hill for mastery of the Northern Pacific . This led to a Wall Street crisis and Harriman was defeated . He turned his attention again to the Union Pacific-Southern Pacific . He actually wanted only the Central Pacific section of the latter railroad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex of Western roads was merged . Later , after Harriman 's death , the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific systems became independent of each other with traffic arrangements acceptable to the Interstate Commerce Commission . But during his reign Harriman controlled 18,500 miles of railroad west of the Missouri and immediately entered upon a campaign of rehabilitation for the rickety Union Pacific . It had an ideal route for a transcontinental road , but its original line made too many detours with too many sharp curves and wicked grades . It was at this point that the **37;1431;TOOLONG fell upon Wells Fargo . The fat cat of Montgomery Street , San Francisco , had never  | been fatter . Three decades of unexampled prosperity had filled its coffers to overflowing . In its strongboxes were nearly $30 , - 000,000 in gold and liquid securities . Month after month with surplus profits of from $100,000 to $250,000 had invested Wells Fargo with a Midas-like quality . Harriman used to boast that he could control any company with an ownership of thirty-five per cent . Now the S.P. controlled Wells Fargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific , he moved in quietly and swiftly on Montgomery Street . The men who had been there for years suddenly realized that a new boss was in the saddle . With the S.P. , Harriman controlled Wells Fargo with even less than his usual thirty-five per cent ! The president of Wells Fargo at that time was Colonel Dudley Evans , who had succeeded john Valentine at the latter 's death . He definitely was a gentleman of the old South , handsome , courteous and courageous . He knew fully his exalted position in the world and demanded not only respect , but deference , which eventually was to be his undoing . He was to meet more than his match in one Edward H. Harriman . The new president of Wells Fargo heard about Harriman 's coup , of course , and calmly waited for Harriman to send for him . There was much to be discussed . For instance , that matter of the express contract with the Union Pacific . In order to supplement properly its operations on the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union Pacific . The Colonel smiled pleasantly as he contemplated the fact that the new power in control of Wells Fargo was the man who was also in control of Union Pacific . It would all be easy now . While he was waiting , Dudley Evans ordered the sign painter to prepare Wells Fargo signs to go up on the U.P . stations all the way from Ogden to Denver , Omaha and Kansas City . But Harriman never sent for Dudley Evans . The president of the proud firm of Wells , Fargo and Company grew more and more restive . Days passed . And still no word from Harriman . Finally Evans broke down , swallowed his pride and  | went direct to the magnate , which he should have done in the first place . He was received coldly . " We have given the express contract on the Union Pacific to the American Express Company , " was all that Harriman said . That was a bitter pill for the president of Wells Fargo . Soon the American would not only be in Ogden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wells Fargo strongholds of Los Angeles and Portland . ' ' ?  --  On the heels of this blow was to follow the loss of the bank . The new captain of the ship did not particularly care for the banking operation of Wells Fargo . He felt that what had been in the early days of the company a great aid to the miners and the other colonizers of the modern California had , by the turn of the century , become an anomaly . For one thing the bank was far too rich . There were not nearly enough deposits or liabilities in comparison with its capital . Its vast surplus far outbalanced its deposits . It should have had more depositors and less surplus . Of that E. H. Harriman was certain . Another factor worried Harriman : he did not like some of the loans that the banking department of Wells Fargo had been making . Lloyd Tevis had been entirely too generous with his friends . Long before the end of the last century agriculture had supplanted mining as the chief industry of California ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years away . But the superb Central Valley already was in full development . Wine grapes , wheat , other cereals and vegetables were beginning to flow out of it in fullest measure . To the farmers of these crops Wells Fargo was a godsend . All of these crops were highly seasonal . Wells Fargo financed these agricultural enterprises by the millions of dollars , so they could meet payroll and other year-round expenses . While banking never was his end of the business , John J. Valentine , even before Harriman 's advent , had felt that Lloyd Tevis overdid that sort of banking . And so did E. H. Harriman . Harriman was not dissatisfied with the quality of the loans so much as with their size . He was used to banking in New  | York where the banks did not take too large a proportion of any one corporation 's paper . Wells Fargo had two loans of a million-and-a-half dollars each to two big corporations . Both were perfectly good , but Harriman felt they were entirely too big . He felt that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank . He found a purchaser in Isaias Hellman , president of the Nevada Bank of San Francisco . Thus , in 1905 , the Nevada Bank purchased from Wells Fargo the banking department of the business in exchange for 200,000 shares of stock paid by the new bank ( which was called the Wells Fargo-Nevada National Bank ) to Wells , Fargo and Company . This represented the value of the assets that Wells Fargo turned over to the new bank . The rest of the huge surpluses which had been piling up from the express business were retained by Wells Fargo and at last , Harriman , as head of the express company , was in control of these huge sums . He was now free to go ahead and distribute most of the assets gradually in the form of cash and stock dividends and so to finance the complete reconstruction of his Union Pacific railroad . With Wells Fargo 's surpluses as a starter and the best brains and experience of United States railroading in executive control of his system , Harriman began the physical perfection of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relocating , realigning and reconstructing it over Sherman Hill , Wyoming , building new stations and new terminals , double tracking the entire main line of the U.P . and buying a tremendous amount of rolling stock . And on the Central Pacific he shortened the main line west of Ogden by forty miles by the thirty-two mile Lucin cutoff straight across the head of the Great Salt Lake . The plans he had for his railroad empire were magnificent indeed , but on September 9 , 1909 , he died . It marked the beginning of the end of the close alliance between the Southern Pacific and the Union Pacific . It also meant , so far as Wells Fargo was concerned , that the company would never have the  | operating contract on the U.P . On this score the company missed out completely . So it was that Wells Fargo was changed by a railroad king . From 1905 on Wells , Fargo and Company was devoted wholly to transportation and express . The independent Wells Fargo I Bank assumed an important role in the history of California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see its like again . Harriman died before he could complete his transcontinental network . Even so , had he lived , times were changing . Theodore Roosevelt was President , and his trust-busting program , which included the revitalizing of the Interstate Commerce Commission , was in full swing . His denunciation of " malefactors of great wealth " and " big business " applied alike to the Standard Oil , the United States Steel and the great railroad manipulators . A new concept of the responsibility of the enterprisers was coming into being and , whether they liked it or not , the corporate giants were being forced into regulation which recognized not only their obligation to stockholders and investors but also to the people as a whole . The day of the ruthless old free-booters was done ? finished . Had Harriman been delayed just a few years in his absorption of Wells Fargo , the new regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission , which were being enacted into law , would have made a different story and the history of the Fat Cat of Montgomery Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it another way , had Harriman 's ruthless dream of empire ever brought him to the place where he was willing , as a pawn in his gigantic game , to give Wells Fargo a contract on the Union Pacific , things would have been different in another way .  | Historically , Wells , Fargo and Company , Banking and Express , were one and the same . As in the case of most human institutions the need dictated the nature of its organization and brought forth the men to make it work . In the rough days of the gold rush the treasure which the miners unearthed required both safekeeping and transportation . Wells Fargo supplied them steadfastly and swiftly ; As we have seen , the company set up banking offices at convenient points in the Mother Lode country and the other great diggings of the state where  | it received from the miners the nuggets and gold dust , gave receipts for the precise number of ounces and dispatched it to the Assay Offices in San Francisco . When Uncle Sam had established the exact value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge , was placed to the credit of the miner at the branch bank nearest his claim . It took ingenuity , brains and guts to build up such a system in a frontierland ? not to say the highest integrity . The result was to create good will for Wells Fargo with the early settlers ( who became the financial leaders of the West ) which was to last throughout the life of the company . As Wells Fargo grew , so grew the Wells Fargo Bank . It came to the point where the banking department demanded , and received , its own management , quite apart from the transport functions of the company and in due time separate quarters were established for the bank in Sansome Street . It was there that Frederick Lockwood Lipman first saw the Wells Fargo Bank with which he was to be prominently associated for so many years of his long life . He first came to Wells Fargo in 1883 , when he was but seventeen years old , but he has memories of the company that go at least ten years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father before he was seven years old to the Union Club , then in Montgomery Street , and hearing of the terrific nitroglycerine explosion in the old Wells Fargo building next door . Mr. Lipman joined Wells Fargo when the company was only thirty-one years old as an assistant note clerk . Ten years later , in 1893 , he was appointed assistant cashier , and , after another decade , became cashier . In 1906 , after Wells Fargo 's merger with the great " Bonanza Bank " of the Big Four , the storied Nevada National , Mr. Lipman was elected vice-president . He became president in 1920 . In 1935 , in the midst of the fourth depression his financial career has spanned , Mr. Lipman became Chairman of the Board of the Wells Fargo Bank and Union Trust Company . Commenting on his resignation as Chairman of the Board , the San Francisco Argonaut concluded an editorial with the following words : " Even after his resignation as Chairman of the Board , Mr. Lipman will not relinquish his full burden of  | duty to the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In San Francisco 's banking and business circles , that means that the top-floor office of the Wells Fargo building will remain a source of good sense and sound advice , backed by sixty-six years of Mr. Lipman 's brand of sanity and devotion . " Son of a former resident of Philadelphia who came to San Francisco not long after the gold rush and engaged for a time in the real-estate business , and grandson of a distinguished Prussian army officer , the younger Lipman , born in San Francisco , was reared in the then fashionable Rincon Hill section , now entirely disappeared . The family suffered reverses and , at twelve , young Fred Lipman went to work . He recalls his mother taking him by the hand and walking with him down to Market Street and seeing him safely across that busy , broad thoroughfare with all its traffic and carriages , before there were any of the new-fangled cable cars . After that he found his way to the brokerage house of Latham &; King , both names identified with Wells Fargo , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King some four or five years . During this period he grew to realize that he did not want to be in the mining stock-brokerage business . He wanted to be a banker and perhaps some day to work for the Wells Fargo Bank , or perhaps Ralston 's great Bank of California which then was the shining financial light of all San Francisco . But in the meantime he stuck by the brokerage job , and evenings at night school he studied bookkeeping . Finally he found that the wholesale paper house of Bonestell , Allen &; Company was looking for a bookkeeper and having completed his course he got the job . Latham &; King had been giving him $5o a month , and Bonestell would not raise that figure . However , young Lipman had decided that he was going to be a bookkeeper rather than an office boy so he took the job anyway . In the course of but a few days he found the books of the concern badly in arrears , but he worked hard and finally got them up to date and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of those days , both in personal interviews and by letters . I quote parts of his account herewith : " Homer King had let me go to take this job as bookkeeper ,  | but had not lost sight of me . So when Mr. Wadsworth cashier of the Wells Fargo Bank at that time told him that they wanted an assistant note-teller , one who had had some experience in the mining stock-broker 's business , he called me into his office . " The Bank offered me $75 at the outset . There was nothing glamorous about any of it . I did n't think of it as a lot better than the job I already had , but I was much influenced by Mr. King 's advice . At that time I was seventeen ; four and a half years had gone by . So I went to see Mr. Wadsworth and he took me in to see Mr. Lloyd Tevis and they gave me the once over . ' I remember that Tevis went to Bonestell and Bonestell gave me a good sendoff . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay . " Frederick Lipman went to work for the Wells Fargo Bank May 10 , 1883 . In 1892 Homer King became manager of the bank . He had been treasurer of Wells Fargo , succeeding Calvin Goddard in that post March 18 , 1873 . In after years when the Wells Fargo Bank became affiliated with the Nevada National Bank , under the aegis of the Hellman family , Homer King became president of the historic Bank of California of San Francisco , and there he continued his successful career . At the time Mr. Lipman first went to work for the Wells Fargo Bank it had branches in New York , Salt Lake City , Carson City and Virginia City . With its $2,000,000 in deposits in San Francisco it ranked as about the fifth in the town . The Bank of California , N.A. , was the most important , then came in succession the Nevada Bank , the Anglo-California Bank , Ltd. , Lazard Freres ( afterwards called the London , Paris &; American Bank ) and finally the Wells Fargo Bank . The Giannini Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Wells Fargo Bank at the time that Lipman came to it was situated on the northeast corner of California and Sansome Streets where the Alaska Commercial Building now stands . Mr. Lipman continues his recollections of the bank in those days : " The entrance to the bank floor was up a flight of steps so there were offices below ? which happened to be an insurance  | office . I remember looking down those steps to see my first typewriter . " A little later the Wells Fargo Bank was to get its first typewriter ? one typewriter . And a little after that its first telephone ? just one telephone . The nearest person at hand answered the calls . " But that was before I went into the bank , " continues Mr. Lipman . " The lobby was around the window section . To the left of that , as you went in , was the note desk . That was where I was located . Then , as the counter extended itself around the corner , was the paying teller . On the California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the exchange teller . In front of the note desk was the open space of the lobby . Behind the lobby you went into a glass enclosure where the officers were . The officers of the Wells Fargo Bank then consisted of the cashier and the president . You went into the president 's office by staying at the side of the windows and you went into the cashier 's office by entering a door on the right , just as you went in . " The president was quite separated from the bank . He did not have much to do with the handling of the ordinary affairs of the place , although he was the head of the institution , the man who passed upon all matters of difficulty . The place furthest away was the vault . Between the vault and the Exchange Department were the bookkeepers . In the alleyway behind the paying teller were the people who dealt with the counter checks ? checks being paid over the counter by the paying teller or being received by the receiving teller . It all was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the exchange teller , and the note teller , the three other than the note teller , were men working singly who represented the whole department . The man who was assistant to the cashier had a desk in the cashier 's office . " Young Frederick Lipman was always observant . He laughs when he says that he came into the Wells Fargo Bank at the age of seventeen as an " expert " just when the average boy today is getting ready to go to college . He got the job on account of his " experience . " He says : " I had to go to work when I was twelve , so I had been made  | assistant note clerk when I first came into the bank and the word routine ' hardly suggests the job that was given to me . " The note clerks in those days , as at present , attended to the Bank 's loans and to collateral for them . But in addition to that , in 1883 , young Lipman and his associates also had to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the collections were registered . The bank had a big book and in it one item would run all the way across the page ? the date , the name of the maker of the check or whatever it was , the payee , the endorsers , the bank that it was drawn on and finally the amount ? a lot of work for just one entry . Lipman used to let these items accumulate during the day . Then , at about a quarter past two , he would start work upon them . He worked swiftly , and generally they were done by a quarter to four . Today this sort of accounting in a modern bank is all handled by machinery . " Later , " he adds , " we kept no individual record of anything under $loo and the items under $loo each would be three foot thick at the close of the day ? some fifteen or twenty thousand of them . I had to make a summing up record of them all . Also I had to tend to the registering of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks on our hands . Of course they belonged to our customers , but they all had to be taken care of and registered . We had a huge wallet that we put in the vault every night that held these certificates . No one ever seemed to take the time to audit . Finally I took that task upon myself ; every so often I made a proof . " There came a day when young Lipman found that he was a hundred shares short on a mining stock , and he says that his hair nearly turned gray that night . Afterwards he found that it had been sent on to the Wells Fargo Bank in New York , but without record . That was the sort of thing that used to occur every so often in those rough-and-ready days . No wonder so many bank officers went gray . Early in Mr. Lipman 's career paper bank notes were hardly considered real money . This was in full accordance with the San Francisco tradition which used to abhor " folding money . " Such currency items were then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were so handled . All payments were made in gold . The paying tellers had trays for the $20 gold pieces and each paying teller had a gold shovel . They all became expert in handling $20 gold pieces . These were stacked , twenty pieces to the pile or $400 worth . Then other stacks were measured to precisely the same height , all in multiples of $400 . A customer presented a check and took away gold . But paper money , despite a popular thought to the contrary , always was known in San Francisco . It had been handled at a discount until the resumption of payments in gold by the United States Treasury in 1879 . " With a steadily increasing influx of Easterners into San Francisco , " says Mr. Lipman , " paper money became more andi more tolerated . Lots of individuals would not accept it , but the stores would . San Francisco merchants gradually got in the habit of taking it and the banks were handling both gold and paper until 1914 . Then the first World War broke out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? with San Francisco the only place on earth where gold was actually and freely handled , the question became how to get rid of that San Fran-cisco habit . " The Federal Reserve Bank there finally hit upon an ingen-ious device that worked . It left the banks in a position where although they had to pay gold on demand , they could pay in gold when asked for it , and yet put something of a stopper upon the free distribution of the yellow coin . This was the plan : The banks of San Francisco paid out gold freely upon demand , but only in $20 gold pieces . The $5 and $10 gold pieces were withheld and this gradually killed the circulation . The $2o gold pieces were being used mostly for bank reserves , but the gold in the steadily lessening circulation was practically all in $5 and $10 pieces . Gradually these were turned into the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and then they were taken out of circulation . At first on the small coins the government stood the abrasion losses , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the depreciation . The banking situation in San Francisco in 1883 , when Mr. Lipman first went to work for Wells Fargo , had settled down  | considerably fro the old days of boom and bust which the city had known . The leading bank then , as previously stated , was the reorganized Bank of California , the history of which is a book by itself . This was the institution which was organized in 1864 by the picturesque William G. Ralston and which failed spectacularly in 1875 . It was housed in a magnificent marble Italian palace that Ralston had built at Sansome and California Streets . Dr. George D. Lyman 's book , Ralston 's Ring , gives a vivid picture of perhaps the most vivid character in the entire history of San Francisco . Ralston , it points out , was more than merely a promoter and bank president , builder and financier . He was the vortex of the most sensational decade in the city 's history ? a decade that was to end by his swimming out into the waters of the Golden Gate at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank of California closed in 1875 , the Bonanza Quartet of Comstock Lode fame , Flood , O'Brien , Mackay and Fair , had formed their Nevada Bank . It at once became one of the most important financial institutions in San Francisco . However , when a few months later the Bank of California was reopened under circumstances highly creditable to its management , it resumed its old position at the very head of all the city 's banks . The founders of the Nevada bank fixed its capital at $1o ; 000,000 , which created a sensation as it was the largest capital of any bank in the United States at that time . The Bonanza Quartet was not in the habit of doing things by halves . It was said that once the bank had been chartered , its owners drew a check for $10,000,000 against it . It is not clear for just what purpose , but there was nothing illegal about such a transaction . A little later the capital of the Nevada Bank was reduced to $3,000,000 . Louis McLane , the former president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president . Z. S. Eldredge in his History of California ( Vol . IV ) said that the Nevada Bank opened on October 2 , 1875 , with a paid-up capital of $5,000,000 which was increased about a year later to $10,000,000 and later reduced to $3,000,000 . In 1883 Flood and Mackay engaged in an attempt to corner the world 's wheat supply and the deal , carried on through the Nevada Bank , was so disastrous in its results that , but for the interposition of James G. Fair , who put a large amount of cash into the bank , it would have been obliged to close its doors . Fair , who had withdrawn sometime before from the bank and from the " Bonanza firm " took the presidency of the bank until it reorganized with new capital and new people who brought it into the first rank . Frederick L. Lipman does not believe that this is categorically true . He says : " I felt perfectly sure that Flood and Mackay were not the sort of men who would go into a speculation . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they made in wheat speculation were of a later day . I never heard anyone speak as if the Nevada Bank was not good . The fact of the matter was that those big Nevada magnates who were behind it put up the money when Brander George L. Brander in his administration of the bank had speculated with its money . In other words , in banking you are depending upon individuals and their character and no one had any reason to doubt that those men were not good for their money ? no matter what the bank did . It was because of that difficulty that I. W. Hellman first came into the Nevada Bank . " Isaias W. Hellman came to San Francisco from Los Angeles where he had long since established the firm of Hellman , Temple &; Company , which later became the Farmers ' and Merchants ' National Bank . Hellman , born in the small Bavarian town of Reckendorf in 1842 , had come to America in 1859 and soon afterwards came to the little town of Los Angeles , where he clerked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion ? and laid the foundations of a great fortune . He was shrewd , capable , honest ? and successful . His sons and his grandsons were destined to follow in his steps . Hellman had worked with E. H. Harriman in the financing of the Los Angeles Street Railway Company and had won the respect and admiration of that Wall Street wizard . As has been seen in the previous chapter , Harriman , when he came into Wells , Fargo and Company in 1901 , was not satisfied with conditions in the banking department . He asked Hellman to take entire charge of the Wells Fargo Bank . For a long  | time Hellman hesitated . He already had come into command of the Nevada National Bank , and he felt that that was enough San Francisco banking responsibility . The step that Harriman proposed would have meant the complete elimination of the much-loved Homer S. King from Wells Fargo . No one liked that idea , King least of all . He had been with Wells Fargo for many years and he always had been one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tried to talk Harriman out of replacing him , but Harriman had his own plans and said bluntly that he could not and would not do it . Finally he relented to the extent of suggesting to King that he go to Isaias Hellman and talk the matter over with him . King found Hellman at his summer home at Lake Tahoe . Hellman was friendly , but definite . He told Homer King that while he no longer was a young man ? he now liked to spend much of his time at Tahoe ? he still went east often , was away much of the time , and that he would like to have King take general charge of the Nevada Bank . But when King suggested that he would like to become president of the Nevada Bank Hellman said there could be only one president . It was only a little after this that the Wells Fargo and the Nevada banks were finally merged . Homer King then said good-bye to the Wells Fargo that he loved so dearly and went to the presidency of the California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life . All this anticipates . In 1883 Lloyd Tevis was in the eleventh year of his long term as president of the company ; John J. Valentine , who later was to succeed Tevis , was in charge of express operations , and Homer S. King of the bank . The capital of Wells , Fargo and Company at this time was $3,180,000 . But that was not the whole story . The strength of the Wells Fargo Bank was in those monthly deposits of cash earnings that steadily were poured into it from the operations of the express . The banking department held the bag ? literally . It carried on its books about $1,000,000 , which represented chiefly physical assets , such as buildings , wagons , horses and  | the like . When Wells , Fargo and Company put up its own handsome new building at Second and Mission Streets , this figure was raised to $2,000,000 . Also a few years later Wells Fargo acquired a new office building in Portland , Oregon . It would have been far wiser if the company had invested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later experience in rate cases was to prove : ' The express business was continuously profitable and the profits were all turned into the bank and added to its working capital . Prosperity ruled . Although John Valentine 's chief interest always was in the express end of the business , he had taken notice of Frederick Lipman in the Wells Fargo forces and it was not long before he was sending for this new man and was discussing with him the banking situation up in Portland . Portland was a growing town and it seemed that Wells Fargo had interested itself in the purchase of the Commercial National Bank up there . Frederick Lipman was sent up to investigate the situation and report . This he did , favorably , and Wells Fargo bought the bank . But the investment did not turn out as well as had been expected , and for a long time John J. Valentine held that against Lipman . Portland seemed almost to have been Lipman 's undoing . The Commercial National which had had a hard time of it in the great panic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco , to which panics ? even the great one at the beginning of the ' thirties ? hardly ever were more than incidents , to see if it did not wish to buy and make it a Portland Branch . The proposal looked interesting and Lipman , at the suggestion of Homer King , went up to Portland and looked into the assets of the Commercial National . Mr. Lipman told me what happened as follows : " I listened to what those people said and I passed on a lot of assets that never should have been passed . The reason that I made that kind of error was that I laid too much stress on their good faith . I did n't allow for the fact that a man of good faith might lack something of good judgment . In my investigation I would ask them about this or that or the other thing and they  | would tell me and it would appear to be all right . Homer King came up after I had been there some weeks ; he took my results and Wells Fargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything that we put into it . Mr. Valentine was so annoyed over the whole transaction that he then took hold of the place and ran it his own way , which much increased the loss . Mr. Valentine was not a banker . He was essentially an expressman , and there was none better . " It all was a very bad bargain . Wells Fargo put $300,000 into the Portland Bank and stood a fair chance of losing at least half that figure , but in the long run it lost all of it . The Wells Fargo Bank of Portland ran as an entity until 1905 when , at the time of the Wells Fargo-Nevada National Bank merger in San Francisco , it was sold to the United States National Bank , long since become an outstanding bank of Portland . John J. Valentine became president of Wells , Fargo and Company in 1892 and that was about the time that things began to happen in the banking department of the company . The big spree up at Virginia City was over . No longer was that wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good eating and fast drinking , revolving at its old pace . The streets of the little town that clung so precariously to the steep slope of Sun Mountain no longer were crowded night and day . The mines of the Comstock Lode were not inexhaustible . They had begun to peter out . The completion of Adolph Sutro 's great tunnel under Mount Davidson had been like a shot in the arm to them . There still was gold and silver in " them thar hills " but they were becoming increasingly difficult to mine , and operations were being abandoned . The little trains of the Virginia &; Truckee still made their stiff climb up to Virginia City ? the " crookedest railroad in the world " they used to call it ? but the trains that went up there were fewer and farther between.The huge brick International Hotel burned and was  | not rebuilt . Virginia City was on its way toward becoming the ghost town that it is today . The pretentious Piper Opera House no longer housed a succession of opera and of drama , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper , the Territorial Enterprise , gave up the ghost as did much of the rest of the doomed town . Since the supreme days of the Comstock Lode , the branches of the Wells Fargo Bank at Carson City and at Virginia City had prospered , but to a steadily decreasing extent . When the mining operations in Nevada ceased almost entirely , there was no further use for them and in 1891 they were closed . In that year the manager of the Wells Fargo Bank at Carson had come to San Francisco to confess a shortage in his accounts , and Lipman was sent up there to investigate . A few days later Lloyd Tevis joined him and it was decided then and there to end the banking operations of Wells , Fargo and Company at Carson City and to sell the building to the Bullion &; Exchange Bank . This was done in June , and the local bank carried on the banking business of the pleasant capital town of Nevada . From Carson young Lipman went up to Virginia City to inspect the situation there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an old and trusted employee of the company . However , Lipman found that the books did not balance , and he uncovered the fact that the accounts were short some $150,000 to $200,000 . These men were not inherently dishonest . But with large amounts of ready cash in their possession , in a time when speculation ran rife twenty-four hours a day and new fortunes were being created each turn of the clock , the temptation to take part in it was too much to overcome . Seemingly they all were doing it , but most of them managed to make good on the amounts that they " borrowed . " Of one thing you may be sure ? John Valentine never speculated . Once when he had caught his superior officer in that sort of thing he forced his resignation . But that was John Valentine . You do not find integrity of that sort every day . The Wells Fargo banking branch at Virginia City was at once closed and sold to the Nevada Bank which , in July , 1891 ,  | sent one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco up there to arrange the purchase . It was said that both the Wells Fargo and the Nevada Banks had been directly interested in the development of the fabulous Comstock Lode . The Bank of California also maintained a branch office in Virginia City and it had major mining interests up there . I asked Mr. Lipman if the Comstock mining securities had ever represented any considerable portion of Wells Fargo 's investment up there . He replied , " Decidedly not . The Bank never would put its money into such stuff as that . Even a badly run bank would not do anything like that ? and we were not badly run . The trouble that we had was in loaning on those mining securities ? as well as with the falsifications of the books on those loans ? for which the branch managers were responsible ; although in the long run the parent bank had to make good on them . " Remember that Wells Fargo and Company was always express and banking and that the most picturesque part of the business was the express . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services to the miners . The miners sometimes would make deposits of gold because the metal was too heavy to carry in their pockets ? not always because they wished it shipped away . Wells Fargo took their gold and if the miner wanted us to keep it there it was a banking operation . If he wanted to ship it somewhere it was an express operation In Carson City and in Virginia City in 1891 , both banking and express were run under the same roof . The Bank of California and the Nevada Bank were only banking , but Wells Fargo was both banking and express . " There also was a banking branch of Wells , Fargo and Company at Salt Lake City . It ranked almost as important as the home bank in San Francisco . John E. Dooly was its manager . He was a man of independent means , shrewd and likeable . Lipman tells of one of his first visits , to Dooly at the Wells Fargo Bank in Salt Lake . He says : " I got into town in the morning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there before it opened , but the teller 's cash  | already had been distributed to the tellers so I had to count that first and take the vault cash afterwards . The cash was $9,000 short . I never found it . While I was counting the tellers ' cash , the assistant cashier went down the street to the T. R. Jones Bank and said : I wish you would let me have $9000 in $20 bills . ' They gave him the $9000 . He wrote out the check form they had there , which afterwards was cleared and paid , came in with the $9000 under his coat while I was with the paying tellers . When I counted it , in a final count , the $9000 was there . " , The Wells Fargo Bank in Salt Lake City was sold out to the Walker Brothers of that community , who immediately added it to their already successful banking institution . The four Walker brothers of Salt Lake were Mormons who early made their mark in the community . At every turn they were successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wells Fargo Bank . It was located in lower Broadway , check by jowl with the express office of the company . Before 1905 the laws of the State of New York had been changed so that the Wells Fargo Bank in New York had become a state bank corporation . At that time it was not literally a branch bank of Wells , Fargo and Company ; it was an independent bank with Dudley Evans , president of Wells , Fargo and Company , as its president . H. B. Parsons ran the New York Wells Fargo Bank and ran it very well indeed , but it was too small for the situation there and , finally , after the Wells Fargo Bank of San Francisco had been merged in 1905 with the Nevada National , the Wells Fargo Bank of New York was sold to the stronghold of the Delafields , the National Park Bank , at Broadway and Fulton Streets , which later was merged into the Chase National Bank . It was in 1905 that the Wells Fargo Bank of Portland was sold to the powerful United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ainsworths , which for years proudly advertised upon its plate-glass windows the fact that it was the successor of the Wells Fargo Bank . In January , 1905 , the long-anticipated merger of the Nevada  | National Bank and the Wells Fargo Bank of San Francisco finally came into being . Harriman and Isaias Hellman had engineered it quietly . There had been a time when Harriman had considered the idea of closing the Wells Fargo Bank , but bitter protests had arisen . There still remained the problem of making money with a bank with $16,000,000 capital and only 11,000,000 in deposits . Yet to throw away the name of Wells Fargo with all its vast prestige was unthinkable . As we have seen in a previous chapter , it was in the beginning years of the present century that the id-ea of a merger between the Wells Fargo and the Nevada Banks first began to be seriously discussed . In January , 1905 , Homer S. King accepted the invitation of the Bank of California to become its president and resigned the post of treasurer of Wells Fargo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which he so long had held . Lipman was made president for the few months preceding the merger . That move precipitated the news of the merger of the Wells Fargo and the Nevada Banks , which had been kept secret up to that time . Isaias W. Hellman was then in Europe and the merger could not be brought about until his return . When the news of the approaching merger had become public property , Frederick Lipman received a telephone message from Isaias Hellman 's son , I. W. Hellman , Jr. , asking him to come and see him , which Lipman did , in the very room that he now occupies as chairman of the Wells Fargo Bank . Young Hellman stated that Lipman was to become cashier of the merged bank . In the following April , 1906 , however , San Francisco was visited by the earthquake and fire , in the confusion of which J. F. Bigelow , vice-president of the Wells Fargo-Nevada National Bank , became so worn that he resigned the position . Frederick Lipman was then made vice-president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son of Homer S. King , was made its cashier . The deposits of the Nevada Bank at the time of the merger were , roughly , about $9,000,000 ; those of the Wells Fargo Bank were about $6,000,000 . Despite the efforts of competitors to pull its business away , the newly merged Wells Fargo-Ne- vada National Bank opened April 24 , 1905 , with $16,000,000 deposits , and it never went below that figure . Here is the way that the merger actually was accomplished : The Nevada Bank had a capital of $3,000,000 and a surplus exceeding $i , 500,000 , and it paid its stockholders a dividend sufficient to reduce the combined amount to exactly $1,500,000 . That gave its shares a book value of $150 each . Wells , Fargo and Company qualified with assets of $2,000,000 capital and $1,000,000 surplus by putting in a mass of assets exceeding the deposit liabilities by $3,000,000 . There was a new issue of stock sold to the public at $200 a share ? $2,000,000 all told ? thereby contributing $1,000,000 to the capital fund and $1,000,000 to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3,500,000 surplus and a book value at the start of $158.33 on each of all the shares due to the two banks that had made the merger . " Nineteen hundred and five was a time of great financial activity in San Francisco , " said Mr. Lipman in recalling those days . " The railroads were very busy buying properties , and many other things were going on , so that between April , 1905 , and April , 1906 , our deposits grew from over $16,000,000 to $24,000,000 . That was where they stood at the time of the San Francisco Fire , April 18 , 1906 . After we reopened , following the fire , we had a good deal of insurance money to handle . The Spring Valley Water Company 's financing came on so that we reached a high point on September 1 , 1906 of about $35,000,000 in deposits . We realized , Mr. Hellman and I , and discussed the fact that the high point could not last and we did not expect it to do so . In December , 1907 , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fell off ? back to $16,000,000 again . In this fall we lost $1,000,000 a week in the final six weeks . Pure life-blood . And yet at the end of that gruelling time we had more cash resources than we had before that last $6,000,000 went out . " In the first set-up of the new Wells Fargo-Nevada National Bank , Isaias W. Hellman was president , I. W. Hellman , Jr . and F. A. Bigelow vice-presidents , Frederick L. Lipman cashier , and Frank B. King , George Grant , William McGavin and John E. Miles assistant cashiers . After Mr. Bigelow 's retirement , Frank B. King became cashier of Wells Fargo-Nevada.  | In all these years , E. H. Harriman was a director of the Wells Fargo-Nevada National Bank . He already was a tremendous figure in American business and he was on the board of the National City Bank of New York , but he had refused to go on the board of any other institution . At Hellman 's suggestion , however , he joined the board of the Wells Fargo-Nevada , representing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representing Wells Fargo were W. F. Herrin , prominent in Southern Pacific affairs , and Dudley Evans , its president . From the outset , the new Wells Fargo-Nevada National Bank proceeded to make its influence firmly felt , not only upon ' San Francisco but upon the entire West Coast . San Francisco itself had settled down to a conservative prosperity long before the earthquake and fire . Days of the Argonauts and the Vigilantes and of the swollen fortunes and the excitements of the Comstock Lode were slipping far into the past . San Francisco was developing as a world city of metropolitan proportions , a great seaport set to serve the seven seas in the chief port of the United States upon the Pacific Coast . After the fire , the Wells Fargo-Nevada Bank moved into the building in which it is now located , at the northeast corner of Market and Montgomery Streets . It was designed and built for the Union Trust Company as a fireproof building , and it stood the test of the great fire very well indeed . For a time the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street frontage of the building and the Wells FargoNevada was down the Montgomery side . A little later the Union Trust Company built its present building at Market and Grant , and Wells Fargo-Nevada moved into the entire structure at Market and Montgomery believing it to be the best banking corner in all San Francisco . Eventually the Wells Fargo-Nevada took over the Union Trust Company and merged it into the parent company which then dropped the words " Nevada National " from its title , becoming the Wells Fargo Bank &; Union Trust . Many in San Francisco hope that some day it will drop the Union Trust from its corporate name and become just the Wells Fargo Bank .  | San Francisco slept soundly in the early morning of the eighteenth of April , 1906 . A gay and vivacious city much given to late hours , it went to bed late and awoke late . San Francisco in 1906 was the coquette of five continents . She was rich . Everything that the tips of her slender fingers touched seemed to turn to gold . Her great merchandise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago , New York , even Paris . In fact , one of the most outstanding , the smart shop founded by the old French family of Verdier in the very early days of San Fran- cisco , proudly bore , and still bears , the name of the City of Paris . Contemporary with it was Raphael Weill 's White House , still white and still outstanding . There were many others . San Francisco women were reputed to be the best dressed in the world . Its shops , oriental and occidental , were known across the country . What other city on the whole North American continent could offer such magnificent opportunities for pleasant living ? It was the hey-day of the road companies and the theaters held their own among those of all American cities . No great actor , no great play failed to have a long run in San Francisco . Light opera at the Tivoli was an unforgettable experience . San Francisco had acquired culture ; she always had charm . She had lost much of the boisterous spirit of the gold rush days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On that eventful night of April 18 , 1906 , the Metropolitan Opera Company of New York was in town , Caruso having sung Carmen the night before . The night of the 18th he was to sing Tonio in Pagliacci . Again , all San Francisco , dressed to the teeth , would be at the performance . There would be dinners in the great homes before and suppers after the opera in the vast variety of restaurants that made the city an eternal delight to the gourmet . The great , four-square Palace Hotel would be aglow . There was no other hotel like it in America ; it had a great galleried courtyard eight stories high to the roof which a coach-and-four could enter with ease . There were other great hotels in San Francisco at the beginning of the century ; the new St. Francis on Union Square was among the best . It bore the name of the city and there seemingly had never been a time when there had not been a hostelry by that name . But in all the world there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that huge place , with its brick outer walls eight feet thick , and had gone to the extremes of building factories all over San Francisco to make the carpets and the furniture and fixtures for it . It was the pride of the city , although Ralston never lived to see it finished . Frederick L. Lipman liked music and he planned to attend the Opera that evening of April 18th . On the preceding night  | he carefully packed his evening clothes in a small suitcase . The Lipmans lived across the Bay in Berkeley and , in the morning following his custom , Lipman planned to take his suitcase across to San Francisco on the ferry and , after business , commuter style , he would change his clothes at the bank . Mrs. Lipman would join him and they would go to dinner in town before the Opera . It was all arranged , but it never came to pass . The Lipmans were awakened that morning of April 18th rather earlier than usual . Their house was rocking violently . Another earthquake , thought Fred Lipman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that morning seemed a little worse than usual . Lipman could hear the brick chimneys falling on the . houses all the way up and down the street . Then after a minute the clatter and rumble ceased and all was quiet again . The Lipmans got up and dressed . It was a chilly morning , with a trace of fog in the air and so they hurried . The plumbing in the house was not damaged and the Chinese cook prepared breakfast on the gas range just a little earlier than usual . After breakfast , Lipman took his suitcase containing his evening clothes , kissed his wife and started for the little train that took him down to Oakland Ferry . As usual the train was crowded with other commuters , headed for the city and the day 's work . Lipman stood on the front lower deck of the big , white ferryboat as it finally rounded Goat Island ( in those days it was called Yerba Buena ) . San Francisco appeared through the lifting fog to greet him . At the extreme right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the open sea : the gaunt semaphore whose blades in other years had telegraphed the news of incoming ships to the people in the streets of the town was long since gone . On the foreground the highly fashionable Nob Hill , with the magnificent Fairmont Hotel that James Fair 's daughters were building to their father 's memory ; in the distance Russian Hill with barracks-like wooden houses clinging precariously to its precipitous sides ; the Twin Peaks at the far end of Market Street rose back of all ; Rincon Hill , once the habitat of the San Francisco aristocracy , where Fred Lipman had lived and played had long since been leveled ; at the foot of this great city , the Embarcadero with docks and  | ships and architect Page Brown 's Ferry House with its dominating clock tower and the many white ferry boats clustered at its feet ; the stout red-brick tower of St. Mary 's Cathedral on California Street ; the lofty Synagogue on Bush ; the immense Palace Hotel ; San Francisco in all its glory , for the benefit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ferryboat came closer to the slip as he had done every morning for years . But this morning something was wrong . At two or three places in the town smoke was rising from behind the buildings . Fires , thought Lipman , there must be several of them . The thought worried him . When the ferry docked and Lipman and his fellow commuters had passed through the main door of the Ferry House , there was much confusion in the streets . Fire engines were dashing through the streets , people rushing hither and yon in great confusion . Lipman waited for a few minutes at the foot of Market Street for a cable car . None came . His suitcase was growing heavier . Finally he set out on foot for the new banking house of Wells Fargo-Nevada at Pine and Montgomery Streets . All was in its usual good order at the bank , although the street outside was a scene of noise and turmoil . San Francisco that morning had suffered the greatest earthquake in its entire history . The whole Peninsula , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires were breaking out all over the city . The efforts of the fire companies were almost useless because the earthquake had snapped the water mains of the city as if they had been tubes of brittle glass . There was no water ! That was the tragedy that faced the helpless firemen as the flames spread . At the beginning there must have been twenty fires and gradually they united to make one horrifying conflagration which raged until the night of the third day , destroying or gutting the buildings in nearly three-quarters of the city . Frederick Lipman remembers that morning well : " I carried my suitcase up to the bank , which was at Pine and Montgomery then , and I could see that the fire was spreading . I came up California Street and I could see where the fire was burning in places , but there was nothing in the way to keep me from getting through , although there were fires not so far  | away . I went to the telegraph office and sent the last telegrams that went through Western Union from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call loans that we had out and to send us $3,000,000 . They sent that $3,000,000 through the United States Mint and through that whole period we had that $3,000,000 lying in the Mint ; it was quite a luxury for us to have , for it cost us $9,000 in interest . We never used it . " The Wells Fargo-Nevada opened its doors promptly at nine that morning . Most of the staff were at their desks . Lipman went into the vaults and all was in good order . The vaults were fireproof and , if worse came to worst and the fire swept the bank , it was certain that the vaults would come through safely . They all had faith in those stout vaults . At ten-thirty the firemen came and ordered all hands out of the bank . The great fire was coming closer ; already it had attacked the rear corner of the Palace Hotel whose eight-foot walls had withstood the quake . One of the first guests to leave the hotel when it was evacuated was the incomparable Caruso , a wildly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stair with his most prized possession , an autographed photograph of Theodore Roosevelt tucked under his arm . There would be no opera that night , nor for many nights to come in San Francisco . " As the fire got nearer and nearer Mr. Lipman resumed we were chased out by the firemen , and we put our working books into the vault . When I left my desk I opened it just as any person might easily do , without any specific purpose in mind , and I saw in the top drawer my father 's old watch that my mother had worn from the time of his death until she gave it to me . I took it up , looked at it for a minute , and placed it in my pocket . Right after that I left the room , never to reenter it . We had to get out of the bank at once and that was the last of that . During the day the bank burned . There was nothing else to do , the ferryboats were still running , and I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home that we might buy a little food ? no telling what might happen . But the cities on our side of the Bay were not badly upset by the quake . " Down the Peninsula , though , it was very much different .  | The earthquake had wreaked havoc all the way to San Jose . Perhaps the greatest disaster of all on the Peninsula was the destruction of the magnificent group of buildings of Stanford University . It took years to restore the huge murals made of thousands of small bits of colored stone . Frederick Lipman did not go back to San Francisco on Thursday , the 19th . No one went across the Bay , for the ferryboats had ceased carrying the public . Idle people were not wanted in the badly torn streets of San Francisco . There were no street cars , electric or cable , nor cabs . The homeless survivors either helped in the fire fighting or huddled in parks , vacant lots or other places of safety . Fire companies came on special trains from many miles around to reinforce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the water mains throughout the city was an all but overwhelming handicap . On the following day ( Friday , the 20th ) Lipman returned to the ravished city . The once proud and beautiful town that rose from the sea was a terrible sight . Most of the better-built structures had survived the quake but almost none escaped the holocaust of flame that followed it . High above the town the new Fairmont Hotel towered like a death 's head ; windowless , like eyesockets with no eyes , its white facade blackened . Most buildings met a similar fate ; the huge and curious-looking new City Hall , out toward Van Ness , had been sacked by flame and smoke . The vast Palace Hotel still stood , its outer wall intact but within it was a blackened mausoleum , filled with debris and charred wood ; its great court was a shambles . The hotel would have to be torn down before it could be rebuilt . Among the older buildings of San Francisco was the old stone building at Montgomery and California Streets that John Parrott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing could shake it down . It came through the explosion of 1866 that had killed Wells Fargo 's superintendent , Sam Knight , along with ten other men , and it came through the fire of 1906 a frightful wreck , but still intact . When , some twenty years later , it was torn down to make way for a towering skyscraper , the wreckers found it almost impossible to tear  | it down . Parrott and the Chinese had worked better than they knew . On the Thursday when it had been impossible to get to San Francisco , Lipman busied himself by forcing his way into the crowded telegraph office in Oakland and sending to New York , London , Paris and other far corners of the world , a single message which read : WELLS FARGO BANK BUILDING DESTROYED VAULT INTACT CREDIT UNAFFECTED . On Friday Lipman went up to the ruins of the bank at Pine and Montgomery . The sight saddened him . There was no getting into the place ; faint flames still licked the charred embers . Somewhere , under the rubble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really is fireproof , was Frederick Lipman 's constant thought . There was no place for him to go . No club . No hotel . Nothing ! Finally , he went up to Van Ness Avenue and beyond . E.S . Heller , assistant teller of the bank , had a house at 2020 Jackson Street . His family still has it . The staff of the Wells FargoNevada Bank went there and resumed the bank 's business . It was a crude arrangement , but presently the bank was functioning again . There was no stationery , and stationery is a pretty important thing in the operation of any business . All the big stationery stores downtown had been burned and Lipman and his fellows went out to all the little neighborhood shops and purchased composition books and paper blocks that children used in school . With this paper they proceeded to carry on the affairs of the great Wells Fargo-Nevada National Bank . The staff sat around the dining room table in Mr. Heller 's home and there they handled what mail was received and other immediate affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were a great number of silver quarters in the vaults of the United States Mint in upper Mission Street that had escaped the holocaust and these quickly became the chief medium of exchange in the city of a half million . The various banks in town joined in effecting payments of every sort and  | the commercial life of the city was resumed . Mr. Lipman recalls : " Each bank was in some private house , as we were , and the checks that bank were permitted to handle had to be drawn by that bank or permitted by that bank . Each had a paying teller but he did not pass upon the propriety of the checks . You had to go to the bank to get a certification and present that in order to cash the check . " Seldom has American honor been put to a sterner test . The Wells Fargo-Nevada Bank , as were all other banks in San Francisco , was entirely without books or records of any kind . They could only trust their customers as to the amount of money due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out hundreds of thousands of dollars on the strength of their depositors ' integrity . In the case of the Wells Fargo-Nevada , Lipman estimates that the total loss , due to possible lapses of memory on the part of its depositors , did not exceed two hundred dollars . A few days after the fire had subsided , came the question of the vaults and the notes , securities and other valuable and irreplaceable papers . Frederick Lipman and a few others went down to the once-handsome banking house : " It was the longest trip I ever took in all my life Lipman said . It happened that when we put the working books into the vaults on the tragic morning of the 18th , some were just thrown in on the floor . " The vault which held the books was built on the bank floor , which was just one floor above the basement ; built on the framework of the building . The vault did not go down to the ground , so the fire had run along the ceiling of the basement and it just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was but a floury ash . That was the worst part . After that things began to get better . In the first place we found that only one of the great Boston Ledgers was entirely destroyed . And that was but one of fifteen or sixteen . Then we found at the bottom of the vault the lower part of each book ? and that gave us the footing on each page . By that footing we had proof of what the limit was on that page . We felt better when we saw that .  | We now had the footing of each page and the statements , and we proved up within a hundred dollars . It was all a most dramatic affair ? and it saved us . " The Union Trust Company owned the fine structure at Market and Montgomery Streets in which the Wells Fargo Bank is located today . It is a fireproof building and withstood the fire very well . The Wells Fargo-Nevada moved down to it from Mr. Heller 's house early in May , 1906 . The Union Trust retained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street side . That was the arrangement that prevailed throughout the panic times of 1907 and Lipman recalls how busy he was kept , running back and forth to the Clearing House during that panic . Shortly after the Wells Fargo-Nevada National Bank bought the entire building from the Union Trust which then moved farther up Market Street to Grant . The express department of Wells Fargo was far from asleep during the tragic days of April , 1906 . You could trust Andy Christeson for that . He was the head of Wells Fargo in San Francisco for two busy decades and by 1906 , had become manager of the company on the West Coast . He was a powerful man in physique with tremendous energy and he caught hold of the great emergency with all his vigor . The United States Army , under edict of the President , had placed the stricken city under martial law . Major General Frederick G. Funston of Spanish-American War fame was commanding officer of the entire Western area with his headquarters at the ancient Presidio in San Francisco . Order was restored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army helped tens of thousands to get out of their ruined homes and to places of safety . Many left the city entirely ; some found haven in the great Golden Gate Park . A few went all the way down to Sutro 's Gardens by the historic Cliff House which the earthquake had tumbled into the ocean . Emil La Forest was superintendent of the extensive Wells Fargo stables over on Folsom Street where three hundred  | horses and nearly as many wagons were kept . As the flames approached , La Forest started to move out the horses and movable property . It was a good idea . He had a better one . He phoned Andy Christeson and suggested that the company let people use its wagon equipment to get their household goods out , and to places of safety . Christeson agreed that the idea was a good one and told La Forest to go ahead with it . Within the hour the mobile equipment of Wells Fargo in San Francisco was at work , doing its own large part in the evacuation of the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the oncoming flames . The fleet of dark blue-and-gold ( the familiar livery of Wells , Fargo and Company ) wagons and trucks was turned over to volunteer drivers . Heavily laden with beds , mattresses , tables , chairs , trunks and even the inevitable family cat and dog , the wagons evacuated people to safety . They drove far and wide . They camped out in the vast acres of the Presidio , in equally large Golden Gate Park and far beyond . Wells Fargo equipment carried them . And it is a matter of record that none of their horses and wagons failed to be returned promptly after the crisis was past . Wells Fargo needed those horses and wagons , for , once the flames were conquered , there was the gigantic task of rebuilding the city that had become an all but impenetrable morass of smoking ruins and tottering walls , rubble and rubbish . Streets were choked and impassable . Railroad tracks were twisted and torn and it was months before the noisy and quaint cable cars operated again up and down the steep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed the city were entirely extinguished , tents and small wooden shacks bearing the hastily printed names of commercial firms well known ' in San Francisco were thrown up . Workmen built a temporary St. Francis Hotel in Union Square in front of the ruined remains of the old one . It would be many months before a fine new St. Francis ? and a brilliant , new Palace Hotel ? and the finally completed Fairmont on Nob Hill ? would be ready to dispense magnificent San Francisco hospitality to the world . Courage ruled San Francisco in those grave days . The disaster ? the greatest in the history of any American city ? had  | been relayed in detail by telegraph and cable to the whole world . The reply was instant . Help came from every corner of the country . The Red Cross , with its trained workers and equipment , jumped into the breach . And so did the railroads and steamships . In the evacuation of San Francisco , the Southern Pacific railroad brought out 224,000 evacuees and charged them not one cent . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The express companies brought in supplies . Food and every other necessary commodity began pouring in from far and near . At first , the Army , acting under martial law , received and distributed all foodstuffs . Gradually channels of distribution became normal . Wells Fargo , its wagons and horses safely returned , was hard at work . It commandeered a circus tent and set it up at Franklin Street and Golden Gate Avenue , in the district west of Van Ness which had not been scorched by the flames . The familiar sign , Wells , Fargo and Company , Express , appeared on the tent . The company was again doing business . As soon as lumber could be rushed in , the tent was replaced by a crude , one-story building . Farther down Franklin Street , at Bush , a two-story wooden flat , so characteristic of San Francisco , was taken over as the temporary headquarters of Wells Fargo for the Pacific Coast . Andy Christeson had his office in the front parlor downstairs . Clifford R. Graham was rushed down from the Northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic out of San Francisco . He used the dining room and kitchen on the second floor as his headquarters . He did his job so well that he became the company 's general superintendent at San Francisco . Today , Graham is operating vice president of the Railway Express Agency for the entire Eastern part of the United States and he is regarded as one of the outstanding expressmen in the entire country . The fine six-story building that Wells Fargo had erected at Second and Mission Streets for its general headquarters on the Pacific Coast ( Harriman already had moved the president 's office and a few other top offices to New York ) had remained standing through the earthquake . But , like so many other  | buildings , it was completely gutted by fire . All the records of the most picturesque of all the oldtime companies were completely destroyed . Another temporary Wells Fargo building was put up next to it . This two-story , wooden structure became the downtown city office of the express . A year later the permanent building was restored with two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater than ever before . Like the city , it rose from the ashes . To complete the record of those tragic days , mention should be made of the temporary adjustment of express rates to San Francisco and adjacent points that followed the holocaust . Transportation rates , of the express companies as well as the railroads , had been for years a moot and unhappy question up and down the California coast . But , at the end of April , 1906 , they were slashed . Extremely low rates , in many cases hardly more than nominal , were set . The rates were lowered by Wells Fargo to facilitate the restocking of merchants ' shelves . Wells Fargo again proved itself a good neighbor.  | The Wells , Fargo and Company to which I came as advertising manager in 1912 was , even without the Union Pacific express contract , a business of impressive proportions . The railroads over which it operated by a variety of routes from the Atlantic to the Pacific covered over 8o,000 miles . In addition , there were many routes over steamship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the greatest in all the land . The company maintained its own extensive services , not only in the United States , Mexico and Cuba , but also in Hawaii , Alaska  | and the Yukon , the Philippines and China ? and it was preparing to invade Europe . Even without the Bank in which it still " held a $3,000 ; 000 interest , it was stronger and richer than ever before in all the sixty years of its history . In addition to its paid-in capital of $24,000,000 , it had a surplus of nearly $7,000 ; 000 , and no debts . Yet it was not immune to criticism . There was a growing feeling , gaining ground in the public press and in various legislative halls , against all the express companies , based largely upon their tariffs and charges , and their vast surpluses . The shadow of the oncoming parcel post was drawing closer and closer . The Hearst newspapers and the muckraking magazines were becoming more and more vociferous in their outcries against express charges and prices . " There are just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " shrieked Honest John Wanamaker of Philadelphia in the New York Herald , " and they are known as Adams , American , Wells Fargo and United States Express Companies . " In February , 1911 , Albert W. Atwood , one of the leading journalists of the period , wrote in the American Magazine of Wells Fargo and the other express companies under the title of " The Great Express Monopoly " : For many years before his death , E. H. Harriman dominated Wells , Fargo &; Co. , long one of the richest of the express companies , as one man has rarely dominated any business . But the Harriman estate was hardly less ambitious than Harriman himself and early in 1910 the American Express Company acquired a large interest in Wells , Fargo &; Co . Originally known as the Holladay Overland Mail &; Express Company and capitalized at $5,000,000 in 1872 , Wells , Fargo &; Co. was one of the few express carriers to take the corporate form ... . With $5,000,000 stock , whose original value none living knows , as a starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital to $6,250,000 in 1878 and to $8,000,000 in 1893 . This $3,000,000 of new stock was issued solely for securing a contract from the Southern Pacific Railroad . Part of the stock was sold and the proceeds given to the Southern Pacific ; the rest was given directly to the railroad company . . . . On its $8,000,000 of stock , only a part of which represented  | cash or property , Wells , Fargo &; Co. was able to pay dividends ranging from 6 to 8 per cent a year from 1872 to 1902 , in which latter year 9 per cent was paid . From 1903 to 1905 9 per cent was disbursed and from 1907 to the present time 1911 10 per cent has been the rate . Early in 1910 Wells , Fargo &; Co. declared a 300 per cent dividend , zoo per cent in new stock and too per cent in cash . Upon the increased stock of $24,000,000 , which represented no new capital or investment , the company has been paying to per cent as before in 1912 this was reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the year ended June 30 , 1910 , more than 20 per cent was earned on $24,000,000 of stock , of which $16 ; 000,000 was a dividend , $3,000,000 a bonus given to a railroad company Southern Pacific , and only the remaining S5,000,000 even partly representative of any paid-in capital . At this rate there should be another large extra dividend ready before many years have passed . Finally it may be noted that this glittering business success is based on an investment in real property and equipment of but $6,000,000 . Is it in the least surprising that E. H. Harriman should have given his closest personal attention to the affairs of Wells , Fargo &; Co. ? Atwood was accurate in his facts and figures . He quoted a statement in Harper 's Magazine of 1875 , which said that the express business had created by then over fifty millionaires in the United States . Atwood closed with the comment that when Wells Fargo had but $4,000,000 invested in the business it took in over $66,000 in cash over the counters each day , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire investment . Articles like this did not tend to make friends for the express companies . Shippers and even their own employees were beginning to line themselves up against the companies . Lacking any form of public-relations services , they found themselves beleagured and alone . The astuteness of a Robert Young in public relations was not found in Harriman , or in the estate which took over his affairs after his death in 1909 . The express companies apparently were deaf to criticism and they were to pay dearly for their failure to understand the changing times . There had been many shifts in the Wells Fargo organization . As we have seen , one of the first things that Harriman did was  | to move the general headquarters back to New York . There were anguished cries in San Francisco , for people there had come to regard Wells Fargo as their very own . But Harriman was accustomed to having his way and the protests of the San Franciscans were unheeded . Harriman merely followed the policy that he had used in setting up the general headquarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower Broadway , New York . He had his own offices near by and he demanded that he be kept in constant touch with his properties . While Harriman did not like Dudley Evans , he had retained him as president of Wells Fargo . In 1908 , Emory A. Stedman , R. A. Wells and Andrew Christeson ? all Wells Fargo veterans ? were elected vice-presidents and general managers , and were located respectively in Chicago , Kansas City , and San Francisco . Even though Wells Fargo Express was now a nation-wide institution , it still did over thirty-five per cent of its business in the state of California . Harriman died in September , 1909 , and eight months later Dudley Evans died . H. W. De Forest represented the Harriman interests on the Wells Fargo board and on February 3 , 1910 , Charles A. Peabody , an outstanding Harriman lawyer , also was elected to the board to succeed his deceased client . The distribution of the assets was about to begin . On the loth of February , 1910 , Wells Fargo declared its fabulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $8,000 , - 000 in cash and $16,000,000 in stock , all in one lump sum . I saw , myself , a dividend check of over $2,400,000 made out to r ? a single member of the Harriman family . This was a big melon j cutting . In addition , there were three five per cent dividends in that memorable year of 1910 . Within twelve months the treasurer 's office of Wells , Fargo and Company , Express , had paid out exactly $26,796,740 in dividends . Fortunately for the Harriman estate , there was no income tax in those pleasant days . What a joyous time the United States Internal Revenue offices would have today with such a melon cutting ! Yet in 1910 , outside of Wall Street there was not much attention paid to it . The Wells Fargo vaults were being emptied and that was  | all there was to it . It no longer was a fat cat ? be quite assured of that . The period between the passing of Dudley Evans and the coming of the next president was a hectic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no president in the company , while various interests fought for its control . In this interim a sort of regency had been established for it , and the extremely capable Frederic D. Underwood of the Erie acted as regent ; he " doubled in brass . " When he had closed his ancient desk in the Erie offices in the old Hudson Terminal Building each afternoon , Underwood would stroll down to the Wells Fargo building at 51 Broadway and work until late at night handling the important matters of the express company . It was an awkward arrangement that could not last . There was a good deal of relief at 51 Broadway when it came to an end . The directors of Wells Fargo finally composed their differences and William Sproule was elected president of the company in November of 1910 . This administration lasted less than a year , in all . Sproule , an able and aggressive man , was needed by the Harriman interests for bigger things . It was a pity that he could not have remained longer with Wells Fargo , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as president and was immediately elected president of the Southern Pacific Company with headquarters in his beloved San Francisco . The official roster of Wells Fargo at the beginning of 1910 was as follows : Table The number of express offices at that time was 5,204 . In the midsummer of 1911 long-term contracts were made , enabling Wells Fargo to replace the historic and once-powerful  | Pacific Express Company on the so-called Gould system : Missouri Pacific-Iron Mountain , Wabash and the Texas &; Pacific . Shorter term contracts were made with the Wheeling &; Lake Erie , the Ann Arbor , the Missouri , Oklahoma &; Gulf , a group of electric interurban lines in Ohio , and a number of minor roads . All in all it was quite a formidable array of railroads that faced Burns D. Caldwell when he succeeded Sproule as president of Wells , Fargo and Company October 1 , 1911 , and the end was not yet in sight . Within three years the oldtime United States Express Company would go out of business and Wells Fargo would take over its contracts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed entrances into Washington , Baltimore and Philadelphia , and on the St. Louis and San Francisco . All of which would bring its mileage , in the United States , to nearly 8o,000 miles . The number of offices increased to 9,108 . There still was much money in the treasury , and the company , even with its capital stock tripled to $24 , - 000,000 , paid its ten per cent dividends with the greatest of ease . And there still were no debts . Burns D. Caldwell came to Wells Fargo from the Delaware Lackawanna &; Western , where he had been vice-president in change of traffic . He had been well schooled in St. Louis and elsewhere and had for a time served successfully as head of various traffic bureaus . He was a handsome man with a great 1 shock of snow-white hair , a million-dollar smile and invariably a white carnation in the lapel of his coat . I have never known a kinder , more considerate man . He and his wife lived in East Orange , New Jersey , and twice a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well with her . He tackled his new job with gusto . He aimed for the first time in all history to give an express company a thoroughgoing traffic organization like a railroad . He found Fred S. Holbrook , a former traffic officer of the Vermont Central , and made him vice-president in charge of traffic of Wells Fargo . John W. Newlean , a most able man , was brought in from the Union Pacific and made comptroller , later vice-president . The veteran Charles W. Stockton was general counsel . There was  | a foreign traffic manager ; at the beginning another Wells Fargo veteran , Davis G. Meller , was chosen for this post that was to come to large proportions . Dudley T. Mervine had another newly created position , that of general superintendent of transportation . There was an efficiency manager and an advertising manager , the writer of these pages being chosen for the latter position , and it was by all odds the finest job that he ever was to hold . Out on the line were two vice-presidents and general managers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second and Mission Streets , San Francisco , Andrew Christeson . Chriseson and Stedman as operating heads divided the whole vast territory of Wells Fargo lines between them . Around them were grouped a remarkable group of general superintendents : F. J. Hickey at New York , Grover B. Simpson and H. B. Calkins at Chicago , Gerrit A. Taft at Houston , Elmer R. Jones at Los Angeles , and Clifford R. Graham at San Francisco . Under the stimulus of an untiring executive like Burns Caldwell the men he hired produced magnificent results . New methods which had long been needed were introduced . New ways were devised to promote the use of the express . For instance , down in the swift-growing Southeast , especially , merchants were being told that they need not stock their shelves as extensively as they had in the past . Methods in the women 's clothing industry had changed radically . Women , at least the greater number of them , no longer made their own dresses . Ready-mades were now the thing , from one end of the country to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . It flooded the shelves and the hangers of merchants with ready-mades . It all took capital . Even the country storekeeper had to keep a considerable amount of capital tied up in stock , which did not always move too quickly . Wells Fargo came to the rescue . It said to the merchant in the little town in Texas , or Colorado or Oregon , far distant from New York , the chief center of the ready-made garment industry : " You do not need to tie up a lot of capital in stock . You do not need to carry every type of woman 's frock in every color  | and every size . Just a representative lot ? one size in one color and one style , another style in a different size and color . Your customer comes in ; she knows her size and perhaps she knows the color she wants . She picks out the style . You do not have that particular garment in stock . What of it ? That evening you send a telegram to New York and in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style and color that milady wants is ready for her . " The scheme worked well . The merchant saved money and Wells Fargo profited . Ever since Dudley T. Mervine had refrigerated that old i Santa Fe baggage car for shipping meat , poultry , butter and eggs , seasonal fruits and perishable vegetables , Wells Fargo had enjoyed a swiftly increasing business in foodstuffs . In the top season when these ran high in volume they traveled 1 by refrigerator cars in fast freight service . Wells Fargo was content to take the pre-season and after-season business which demanded the very swiftest service . The business swept into an astounding volume . The George Apley sort of Bostonian who sat at his breakfast table and talked proudly of the halibut that came from the Newfoundland banks down to the markets of the Hub little dreamed that the fish on his table probably had been caught five thousand miles from Boston , brought by fast steamer to Seattle or Tacoma , and then sent east by Wells Fargo . Wireless from the steamers still hundreds of miles at sea had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refrigerator cars , all ready and iced , stood at the wharves to take the cargo east . The kosher markets of the eastern cities demanded absolutely fresh live fish from the Great Lakes ; Wells Fargo , co-operating with the Baltimore &; Ohio , provided cars filled not only with fresh-water tanks but with apparatus for the constant changing of the water . The fish had to be in perfect condition when they arrived from Sandusky . There were strawberries from Sacramento , asparagus from Jersey , prunes from Santa Clara , garden truck from almost anywhere in the great Central Valley of California ; oranges , grapefruit , lemons , dates and figs from Southern California ;  | the rich food outpouring from the lands of the Imperial Valley ; from the newly irrigated fields of the Valley of the Sun , in and around Phoenix ; the vast productive terrain of the lower valley of the Rio Grande and the rich marginal lands all along the rim of the Gulf of Mexico . There were melons out of Rocky Ford , Colorado , peaches and strawberries from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming in a mighty volume ; oysters and fish from the Chesapeake Bay and Louisiana ; apples , grapes and other fruits from Western New York and Northern Ohio . The variety was almost endless . This was the gold of the twentieth century . In swiftmoving quantities it ran into millions of dollars of revenue for Wells Fargo . The company also operated outside the United States . For a good many years Wells Fargo had been active in Mexico ? of which much more in another chapter ? and in Cuba . Alaska was within operating range of the company , and it was not long after the Klondike gold strike in 1896 before Wells Fargo was bringing oranges , bananas , other fresh fruits and vegetables up into Dawson , Nome and St. Michael . It is 2,487 miles from Seattle to St. Michael ( Nome is near by ) but all through the summer Wells Fargo , using the coastwise steamers , managed to get fruit from Seattle to Kennecott in six days , to Dawson in ten days and to Fairbanks in sixteen . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has - always been Wells Fargo 's specialty . So when , in De m , 1911 , the company first began the operation of dog sleds over the tops of the snow drifts of Alaska , it merely was keeping pace with its oldtime traditions . That pioneer run became typical . 479 mile trek in the dead of winter from Iditarod to Seward was but a part of the day 's work for Wells Fargo . For the initial run two teams of sixteen dogs , under the charge of two noted mushers , Norton and Griffith , were selected . In two Yukon basket sleds rested a shipment of $558 , - 963.44 in pure gold . A responsibility , but nothing new for Wells Fargo . This dog-sled shipment of gold was a long trek , a run of  | fifty-four days from Itadarod to Seward . On the 6th of February , 1912 , they arrived at Seward and their shipment was placed immediately on the S.S. Alameda of the Alaska Steamship Company . Five days later it was in a bank in Seattle . This shipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the railroad was built from Cordova . Horses were used instead of dogs for a 376-mile run which carried $600,000 gold in eleven days . Of course there were products other than gold that came out of Alaska in those stirring days . The Wells Fargo superintendent at Seattle , Jim Hill ( no relation to the empire builder ) , was kept pretty busy looking after the shipments to and from the Arctic Circle . He constantly went back and forth to Alaska . It used to fascinate him to see the little kayaks , the comiaks and the bidarkas bring small fortunes in walrus ivory , furs and other trophies of the hunt into the port of St. Michael . The most fearless men sailed all the way from Port Barrow in the Arctic Sea down through the Bering Straits , a passage only possible in the summer months . Sometimes as much as a half a million dollars in furs were brought down in a small vessel , itself hardly worth $1o,000 . Across the Pacific Wells Fargo by 1911 was well established with offices in Hawaii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being made in Europe . For a long time Wells , Fargo and Company had maintained a commercial office in Threadneedle Street , London , but by 1912 President Caldwell was planning to invade England , France and Germany to provide real competition for the allpowerful and immensely successful American Express Company . Bertram Lord , a former American Express executive in its foreign service , was chosen to inaugurate tourist services in London and Paris . Wells Fargo already had inaugurated a comprehensive system of money orders and travelers ' checks of its own , and these were meeting with ready favor . For the Paris office of Wells Fargo and Company a roomy store was chosen on the Rue Scribe , close to the Opera and a bare stone 's throw from the historic Paris quarters of the American Express Company . In the new office in London at  | 10 Charles Street , just off Haymarket , American Express again was a neighbor and friendly competitor . Both of these new offices , handsomely fitted out and staffed for the comfort and the pleasure of the American tourist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I flamed over Europe . The coming of World War I in the summer of 1914 found thousands of American tourists stranded in continental Europe and in England frantically trying to get home at once . It so happened that F. S. Holbrook , the traffic vice-president of Wells Fargo , was in Germany at the time . Holbrook watched with dismay the efforts of the tourists to struggle their way back to the United States . In the mad rush luggage was left behind and forgotten . As soon as the worst of the excitement was over , Holbrook took upon himself the task of getting together the abandoned trunks and other luggage . On his own responsibility he caused 400 trunks to be shipped to New York where in the course of time they were claimed and picked up at the Wells Fargo warehouses by the original owners . No charge was made for this service , but Holbrook 's quick action brought Wells Fargo many thousands of new and enthusiastic friends . The new offices in London and in Paris remained open for the duration of the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American armed forces . Offices that had been planned for Hamburg , Berlin , Brussels and Rome never were opened . World War I ended Wells Fargo 's European enterprises . Burns D. Caldwell , sitting in his comfortable office overlooking New York Harbor , swelled with pride at the strides that Wells Fargo had made under his leadership . The company still was making money hand over fist . Despite the vast increase of its capitalization it continued to pay its six per cent dividends each year . More important was the rise in Wells Fargo prestige . The old company was making a world-wide reputation for efficient and friendly service .  | But there were those who said that express as a business was dying , that there soon would be a newcomer in the field of handling packages large and small in the United States that would put the old line companies completely out of business . Although Caldwell refused to accept defeat , he watched nervously as the United States Post Office Department established a parcel-post system just prior to the beginning of World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The old line express companies had set themselves firmly against the parcel post , already well-established and well-liked in Great Britain and other European nations . We have already seen what John Wanamaker had to say about the parcel post . In the period of changing times the advantage to the whole people of the parcel post was recognized and soon it was put into being . Its immediate effect on the express companies was a reduction of their rates for handling small packages . The long-range effects are not so easily stated , but it is certainly true that the parcel post has been doing pretty well ever since its inception ; and so has the express . The Wells Fargo Messenger , the company paper of which I was the editor , carried an editorial on the question of the parcel post in February , 1913 , which well reveals the attitude of Wells Fargo to their new competitor : The new-born year brought to the express a competitor worthy of its mettle ? the new parcel post . This country has had a parcel post for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radical enlargement of the old , both in raising the weight limit of packages from four to eleven pounds , in establishing a lower scale of rates through a zone system and requiring the issue of a special series of stamps . A great many Wells Fargo men have hardly known just how to view this new competitor . There should be no hesitancy as to their attitude . They should treat this newcomer as worthy of respect , realizing that he represents governmental policy and is an experiment of national interest . And they should consider that the express , vital to the commercial life of the nation , gains growth and strength not by opposing competition , but by rendering a service which best meets public necessity and convenience .  | This editorial , which was widely circulated , brought many expressions of approval . Compared with the express , the parcel-post business was easy to handle . There was no pick-up service and , save in the case of registered packages , for which a special charge was made , no receipts were issued . Throughout the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system under which , a receipt , which was practically a waybill , was issued for every single package that it accepted for transport . A package going across the continent might easily traverse a half dozen different railroads . That meant that each of the six railroads was entitled to a proportion of the charges . To figure out the earnings of all the packages of all the railroads on , say , aoo , 000 waybills , was no small bookkeeping job . When William Sproule transferred the accounting department of Wells Fargo from New York to Chicago in 1911 , it meant the removal of Imo employees with their families and their personal effects , all at the expense of the company . As time went on , the tariff sheets of the express companies had become increasingly difficult and complicated . They were in effect a vast structure with many ramifications to meet a variety of emergencies . The final result was a patched-up structure with very little order or consistency . At the beginning of the second decade of this century there sat on the all-powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ability , Franklin K. Lane . Later Woodrow Wilson chose Lane as his Secretary of the Interior , in which capacity he added to his record of public service . In the course of his thorough investigations of the entire transport picture of the United States , Lane had come across the ancient tariff structures of the expresses . He was horrified by their confusion and their lack of efficiency . He sought to create a new schedule of equitable express rates , understandable to the average user . After many months of patient work he evolved a tariff sheet , essentially simple in its working . Lane divided the entire United States into several thousand blocks or zones uniform  | in size . All express rates were divided into two classifications and the amount of the charge on any package depended on the classification and the number of blocks crossed . There was some slight variation in the rate scale per block in various portions of the country but in general the new scales reduced express rates on an average of fifteen per cent . The express executives did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parcel post had been put so far below those of the express that they felt there must be some reduction to meet the new governmental competition . Even so there was opposition in some quarters . A few of us in Wells Fargo saw the folly of obstruction . I went to the president of the company , although it really was none of my business , and begged him to accept the Lane plan as graciously as possible . " Do n't you see , " I told Mr. Caldwell , " that those Washington boys have you licked , no matter which way you turn ? If you find definitely that you can not beat a man , why oppose him needlessly ? Let Wells Fargo refuse to be bogged down by the fears and the silly traditions of its fellows in the business ; let it be the first to accept the new order of things , so much , much better than the old , and accept it graciously . " He took my advice . I went down to Washington , saw Lane , and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine job and that the company would go along with the new plan . Lane turned to me and said : " Fine , that sounds like the old Wells Fargo . There 's plenty of life in the old fellow yet .... " And so there was . The new plan went into effect early in 1914 , and within the year there was hardly an expressman the whole land over who was not blessing it . There was indeed a new order of things . In midsummer of 1914 came the spark that set half the world afire and Wells Fargo and its fellows were in for it . A tremendous burden was placed on the express . Shipments for the armed services and for civilians increased by leaps and bounds . Men worked night and day . The volume of traffic rose to astounding proportions as trains across the land carried the goods of war .  | Number Nine went out of the ancient Erie terminal at Jersey City each night freight-laden to the roofs . Always a pet of Wells Fargo , Number Nine was the fastest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the fastest train on the Santa Fe . Her departure from the Jersey City Pier each week-day evening was something of an event . After the close of the business day , the 400 wagons of the Wells Fargo fleet in New York and Brooklyn were ferried to Jersey City . All of the packages from these hundreds of wagons were dumped on a great revolving platform at the Wells Fargo pier in Jersey City and sorted for their hundreds and thousands of destinations . At 7:40 each evening the sorting was over . Eight o'clock was Nine 's rigid departure time . Ten minutes before that hour its various through cars were locked and sealed : the Texas car , the St. Paul , the Los Angeles , the " San Fran , " the " K.C. , " the Wisconsin , the Buffalo , and still others . Through the still open door of the forward car ( the " messenger car " ) , the messenger and his helper could be seen buckling on their holsters . No monkey business for a train with perhaps a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last door slammed shut and was locked . The depot agent raised his hand and the Wells Fargo Pony Express of the twentieth century was off for Chicago . It was always a thrill just seeing Number Nine make its evening " depart . " Three thousand miles across the continent in San Francisco veteran city agents , Tol Elliott and Bill Kiefer , daily prepared their eastbound express for the Overland the Wells Fargo pier close to the Ferry House . All the rest of the way up and down the West Coast and far inland Wells Fargo would be setting out on its nightly treks to Chicago and the Atlantic seaboard . War and its necessities also but a part of the day 's work , of the unending work of the express . On a pleasant day in June , 1918 , we were told that Wells , Fargo and Company was going out of business forever , on the final day of that very month . The three great operating companies of the express in the United States : Adams ( which in- cluded the Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company were to be merged into a single agency to be called the American Railway Express . It was a bitter pill to Wells Fargo men . That the name of their disliked competitor should be chosen , and that of their own beloved company ruthlessly thrust aside , was bad enough . They were all promised jobs with the new company , but some of them refused to accept them . They preferred to remain Wells Fargo men in spirit if not in fact , until the end of their days . As will be recalled , W. G. McAdoo was Secretary of the Treasury under President Woodrow Wilson , and later directorgeneral of the United States Railroad Administration . The suggestion was made that the three big express companies be merged " in the interests of winning the war . " McAdoo is credited ( or discredited ) with having been the active force behind the idea . It was being said freely in Washington that he was using the proposed express merger for his own political advancement . The express business in the United States at that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressive in their personal relationships with the rank and file of their employees . It was not until 1915 that the highly prosperous Wells Fargo came forth with a comprehensive , modern and extensive pension and benefit plan for its workers . The pay in the express as compared with other businesses of a like nature was not high . Yet the conditions of general employment were such in those days that Wells Fargo men not only worked hard , but generally retained a loyalty for the old company that was translated into splendid morale . But McAdoo , so it was said , subtly spread the idea of unionism among the rank and file of all expressmen . Come together into one company , was what he said in effect , and I will see to it that you get the protection of the union system . Whoever was responsible , the merger was made . Adams , American and Wells Fargo merged to form the new American Railway Express , to cover with one exception the entire railroad map of the United States . That one exception was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harrison , did his own thinking and went his own way . Soon after the beginning of World War I he had quarreled with the White House and had withdrawn into his shell . He refused to accept the ill-considered dictum of the express merger . For the Southern , Harrison created the independent Southeastern Express , which covered effectively the entire southeastern part of the United States and which remained in business until after Harrison 's death when it finally was merged with the American Railway Express . The details of the merger were engineered by the extremely capable George C. Taylor , who , in 1914 , had succeeded the aged James C. Fargo as president of the powerful American Express Company . He became president of the new American Railway Express . Burns D. Caldwell was made chairman of the board of the new company . The rest of the executive offices were parcelled out among the executives of the three companies . There was much bitterness . Once the new combination had been made , the Wells Fargo signs and insignia were torn down all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insignia of the American Railway Express . Wells Fargo disappeared from the telephone listings everywhere ; the name was apparently never even to be whispered . When I went out to San Francisco in 1922 , one of my old Wells Fargo pals there caught me by the sleeve and pointed to the roof of the handsome old Wells Fargo building at Second and Mission . There , outlined against the sky , stood a modest sign reading , " Wells , Fargo &; Co. , Express . " " They have n't discovered it as yet , " Bill Kiefer whispered to me . " We have n't told them and they are not smart enough to find it . When they do , it will come down . " Bill Kiefer was right . When it was discovered , the sign was torn down . Only the raised lettering in the great lintel stone over the door , " Wells , Fargo &; Co. , Express Building , " remained . That lintel was a sort of a shrine to good Wells Fargo men . They would look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , thinking of the company that was .  | After the merger , Wells , Fargo and Company retained its corporate existence and some of its assets . It received $10,075,400 in stock of the American Railway Express , a part of which was offset by its contribution of automobiles , horses , wagons , office equipment , etc . It still had its precious twenty-thousand shares in the rich Wells Fargo-Nevada Bank in San Francisco . It also had its interests in Mexico and in Cuba , but it was not an encouraging picture . One of the finest trade names in all America had been thrown into the discard ? and with it the faith , loyalty and ambition of 25,000 men and women employees . The other companies adjusted themselves to the change . Long since the American Express had built up a magnificent overseas organization . What Thomas Cook &; Sons was to the Britisher away from his native land , the American Express Company had become to the traveling American . It was his banker , his forwarding agent , his post office , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly profitable traffic in travelers checks , money orders and the like . All this business it chose to retain as it continued its operations with headquarters in its great building in lower Broadway , New York . The Adams Express Company decided to remain in business as an investment company , and as such it has been successful . Only Wells Fargo chose to give up the ghost . It sold its 20,000 shares of Wells Fargo-Nevada stock . Its own shares , which had never dropped below the par of $loo a share , were reduced through distribution to stockholders to a par value of $1.00 per share . The New York Stock Exchange removed the name from its listings , where it had been for so many years . A few Wells Fargo men did not go to the American Railway Express . One of these was Davis G. Meller , expert in foreign affairs as well as in the food-handling ends of Wells Fargo 's vast activities , who replaced Burns D. Caldwell as president of the corporate Wells , Fargo and Company . Another was Elmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also remaining in the Wells Fargo family were James O. Ellis , who joined the organization in 1903 and is Vice-President of the company  | and its subsidiaries , and the editor of the Wells Fargo Messenger . In its final issue ( June , 1918 ) I wrote this editorial : In the transfer by Wells Fargo of its domestic express operations to a new company which is to handle the express business of the country under a contract with its Director-General of Railroads , the nation loses an institution , hardly less distinctive than the great Capitol down at Washington . For sixty-five long years our company has kept the faith . Its task has been trust , and no man has ever trusted it in vain . From the stirring California days in which it was born down to the stirring times in which we move this day and hour , Wells Fargo has been synonymous with honor and energy and ability . Wells Fargo men ! What a regiment they have made ! And before this company of the present , the serried ranks of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation of the pioneers . What a mighty army , moving forward in eternal step and cadence ! And above the shuffling of the feet , the clatter of the lumbering stages and the crack of a whip in the silence , the calls of the dust-enshrouded boys who raced their ponies across the plains , the echoes of the first locomotives , the splash of the sea against the bows of swift ships bearing precious burden to and from San Francisco ? and the honorable young firm of Wells Fargo &; Company . Wells Fargo men ! And steadily marching feet ? in perfect time and good order . In good order Wells Fargo marched in ? back in those stirring days of 1852 ? and in good order Wells Fargo marches out ? in these stirring days of this year of grace , 1918 . Marching out of an unsullied page of American history and into a new and glorious career of service to our country in its hour of greatest need . We live in a material age . Around us boil and seethe the cauldrons of material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget . But some of us are not going to forget ? this world or the next . In the quiet moments that are given to every man for reflection and retrospection we are going to remember the days of our past ? the days and months and years that come to the mind when the lips breathe those ardent blessed words ? Wells Fargo .  | A great many people wrote me because of that editorial . They saw , as I did , the supreme tragedy of the passing of Wells , Fargo and Company , Express . It was pathetic to see the way older Wells Fargo men clung to the ancient institutions . In every possible way they sought to keep the company alive in their hearts . They retained the honorable name in the telephone directories of the western cities in which it had operated . They behaved as a beleaguered people . Wells Fargo could not die easily . Men wondered why it should die at all . It was quite beyond their comprehension .  | Wells Fargo did not die . Elmer Jones did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank in San Francisco , which long ago passed out of the hands of the parent company and perpetuated the ancient name in an institution vitally associated with the financial and commercial life of the whole Pacific coast . But more important to Jones was the Mexican Wells Fargo . He saw an opportunity and he grasped it . He gathered together some of his close associates among the officers of the  | old Wells Fargo and proposed that they buy the Mexican company and the Cuban interests of Wells , Fargo and Co . George C. Taylor , who was president of the American Express Company , and who was to become president of the new American Railway Express , gave his full approval to the idea . Thus the good name and reputation of Wells , Fargo as a common carrier was to go on . At one time it was suggested that the Mexican and Cuban business be turned over to the new American Railway Express , but that suggestion was almost immediately rejected . The name " American " still was none too popular in Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very great popularity . So , in 1919 , Elmer Jones , as an individual , with the American Express Company , bought the Wells , Fargo and Company Express of Mexico and Wells , Fargo and Company in Cuba for $64o,000 . In 1924 , Jones and the American Express bought Wells , Fargo and Company in the United States from the Harriman estate with the agreement that other stockholders who cared to sell their stock could do so at the same price . Eighty per cent of the remaining stockholders accepted the offer . - After careful study and with full approval of George C. Taylor and Frederic P. Small of the American Express , Jones made the arrangements with Charles A. Peabody and Robert W. De Forest , executors of the Harriman estate . Under the new ownership the shares of the original Wells , Fargo and Company acquired , were divided , 51 per cent to the American Express Company and 49 per cent to a group consisting of officials of American Express Company and Wells Fargo &; Company , headed by Mr. Jones . Headquarters were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have since remained and where the parent company operates under the Colorado charter of Wells , Fargo and Company . In this way the legal as well as the sentimental continuation of the original company was brought about . While it was deprived of its package express service upon the railroads of the United States by the merger , it had plenty to do . Wells Fargo had been in Mexico since the very beginnings  | of the company . I very well recall going into the Acapulco office in 1940 . The old office there had been opened in 1852 and it had changed but little since then ( a few years ago the old building was torn down and Wells , Fargo and Company moved into modern quarters in the swiftly growing resort town ) . The old office had great charm . I recall the large mechanical fans up against the high beamed ceiling ( in the Far East they call them punkahs ) moving listlessly backward and forward but seemingly forever . It was a fascinating old place : in ninety years it was practically unchanged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish colonial charm . In Wells Fargo 's earliest years it had operated on the lines of the Wilcox and Pacific Mail Steamship Companies between Panama City and San Francisco : only the Wilcox ships operated into the Mexican ports of Guaymas , Mazatlan , Acapulco and Salina Cruz . From the outset Wells Fargo opened offices in each of these four ports on the West Coast of Mexico ; it is still doing business in all of them . In the early ' seventies British capital completed the stoutly built Mexican Railway from Vera Cruz on the Gulf side up to Mexico City , one of the most , remarkable pieces of railroad construction in the entire world , and in 188o Wells Fargo moved on it into the Mexican capital over which they operated until 1943 when service was stopped by mutual consent . The road was acquired by the Mexican Government in 1948 . The express company also operated on the Mexican Central that had come south to the capital from El Paso . The company opened offices on the Calle Donceles , in the stone palace built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the very heart of Mexico City , although Wells , Fargo and Company is no longer quartered in it . This old palace is even today regarded as one of the architectural gems of this continent . About fifty years ago the ambitious Southern Pacific system decided that the time had arrived for it to thrust a long arm down into Mexico . Down the West Coast of Mexico , from Nogales , Arizona , on the border to Tepic , more than 70o miles to the south , it built a fine modern railroad , the Sud Pacifico de  | Mexico . Threading Hermosillo , Guaymas and Mazatlan , it opened up the magnificently rich states of Sonora and Sinaloa to development ; it finally reached Guadalajara , the important capital of the province of Jalisco , where connection was made with the Mexican National Railways leading to Mexico City and most of the other important cities of the country . Colonel Epes Randolph , of Virginia , was the master-mind of this stirring project . In his day Randolph was considered one of the outstanding railroaders of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw the first single-span railroad bridge across the Ohio at Cincinnati . At the beginning of the century , when the Colorado River went on rampage , Randolph succeeded in doing the impossible , in damming the onrush of waters and so saving millions of dollars in valuable Southern California property . E. H. Harriman thanked him warmly for his feat . If Epes Randolph had been possessed of even ordinary good health , he would have gone even farther as a railroad builder , but he was a consumptive and was forced to live in the thin , dry , sunshiny air of southern Arizona . When he accomplished the dramatic feat of damming the runaway Colorado River by dumping whole trainloads of material , cars and all , into the river , he commanded the job from a litter in his car , the Pocahantas , named after his well-known ancestor . The Pocahantas was his home on wheels . When Harriman finally recognized his genius , he made him president of the Sud Pacifica de Mexico and Randolph , terribly sick man that he was , went right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him sometimes in his old upstairs office in Tucson ; a mere wraith of a handsome man , sitting close to an ancient wood stove , a shawl gathered around his thin shoulders , a man dying by inches , living and still realizing his magnificent dreams . Epes Randolph lived long enough to see the road built through to Tepic . There it halted for a long time . Between Tepic and the golden city of Guadalajara , just a little way to the east , were ninety miles of high mountains with deep gullies or barrancas between them ? one of the toughest construction problems that ever confronted any railroad builder .  | In 1925 Randolph was dead and Harvey Titcomb was president of the Sud Pacifico de Mexico . Titcomb , long schooled as an engineer on the Southern Pacific , accomplished the seemingly impossible . He built the railroad straight across the barrancas , and it was a good railroad every foot of the way . No matter if there were thirty-five tunnels in the ninety miles of its course , between them fills and trestles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Wells Fargo operated the express on the Sud Pacifico de Mexico . It had operated on the Southern Pacific ever since the days of Lloyd Tevis when the parent road had first been completed . Wells Fargo operated on the Sud Pacifico de Mexico from Nogales to Guadalajara until December of 1944 , when the express function was taken over by an administrator appointed by the Mexican Government as the result of a strike for higher wages . The case was still pending at the time of going to press . When I first met Elmer Jones in 1911 he was a tall , lean , positive individual , retaining all the vigor of his youth . He looked more like a New Yorker than the native Missourian that he is . As a matter of fact , among his forbears was the Culpeper family of Virginia whose ancient courthouse in the old Dominion still bears the family name . There was also much Kentucky blood in his veins . In 1911 , Elmer R. Jones was general superintendent of Wells Fargo at Los Angeles . Already he had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fargo and Company was more than a mere employer to Elmer Jones ; it was , and still is , his life . For it he was prepared to die if necessary , and once or twice he nearly did . There was no crusader for any cause more ardent , more loyal than Elmer Jones . As a small boy in Webb City , Missouri , he had sold the Kansas City Star , down at the railroad station evenings . He watched the little Missouri Pacific trains come and go , and then and there transportation caught his imagination . At fourteen he worked as helper for the depot agent at Webb City . The agent , Grant Wilbur , handled the express for the town . In those days it was the Pacific Express , and presently Elmer Jones was in the express business in one of its lowlier roles ,  | handling freight . It was a rough job , and not suitable for a weakling . But Elmer never was a weakling . He did n't wrestle with heavy boxes of the express for long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was determined to get more , and yet college seemed beyond his reach until one day in 1890 when the state of Missouri announced a competition for scholarships for a two-year course at the University of Missouri that would specialize in military training . He won a military scholarship hands down , and at once headed for the state university . General Enoch Crowder , who afterwards was to come to fame as the general in charge of the draft during World War I , and who became our Ambassador to Cuba , was in charge of the students ' military regiment at the University of Missouri . West Point trained , he was a martinet and a soldier , and the training that he gave the boys was most thorough . Afterwards he was succeeded by Captain Beaumont B. Buck , also a West Point man , and also destined to become a general of distinction in the United States Army . Elmer Jones knew Buck better than Crowder , although he retained his friendship with both these men for many years . He showed an aptitude for military work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he attributes the strength and good health that have been his all his life . But it was the military training that appealed to him most . With the student regiment he traveled the entire state . The drill that the boys put on one autumn at the historic old Fair Grounds at St. Louis was a memorable one . Young Jones wished he could have had two additional years at the University of Missouri , but he could not afford it . He had to get back to work . He took courses in English and oratory in the Cumnocks School of Northwestern University at Evanston . Later in his life he took a four-year law course at the University of Southern California , going to class at night after his regular work was done , and studying at every possible moment in the long day that began for him promptly at six o'clock in the morning . He was graduated with honors from U.S.C.  | in 1914 and soon after he was admitted to the California bar . Jones 's thirst for education has never ceased . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as general superintendent ? and later as assistant general manager ? he carried his books with him and was forever at them . By nature an inveterate reader , and a deep thinker , he always has found his best love in books of substantial character . His special tastes are in law , the Bible , Shakespeare and the standard classics . In October , 1893 , when he was nineteen years old , Jones became a full-fledged express agent at Webb City , Missouri . He spent two years there and two years at the much larger town of Pittsburgh , Kansas . Then Superintendent D. T. Mervine called him up to Kansas City . A short term as a messenger out of Kansas City , a boyhood ambition , was finally realized and then Jones was made a route agent , one of the most responsible jobs of the express . The route agent is a sort of traveling superintendent who sees that the work of the men out on the road is kept right up to snuff . It so happened that when Superintendent Mervine and local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the responsible route agent 's job , the distinguished president of Wells Fargo , John J. Valentine , happened to arrive in Kansas City . He beamed approvingly upon the newest route agent of Wells Fargo , shook hands with him warmly , and said : " I see that you are an ambitious fellow , Elmer . You keep right at it and some day , who knows , you may be president of Wells , Fargo and Company . " Which classifies John J. Valentine as a good deal of a prophet . Route Agent Jones worked first out of Joplin and then out of Hutchinson , then through Southern Kansas , all the while developing new business for the company . In 1906 , he went to Los Angeles , always one of the key points in Wells Fargo territory , as assistant general agent . Three years later he first became identified with Wells Fargo activities in Mexico . And from July , 1909 , to the present he has been associated with Mexican transportation . Early in 1912 Jones was sent to the Argentine and arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations could begin , the war clouds of World War I prevented the extension of Wells Fargo into South America . In 1912 , Jones became general superintendent at Los Angeles and a little over a year later he was assistant general manager and assistant to the vice-president and general manager , Andy Christeson , up at San Francisco . He was succeeded at Los Angeles by L. O. Head , who recently retired as President of the Railway Express Agency . Jones 's progress was steady . In 1916 , he was appointed assistant to the president , Burns D. Caldwell , of the parent Wells , Fargo and Company in New York . He remained in that post until the express activities of Wells Fargo in the United States were absorbed by the warborn American Railway Express . Jones , as we have seen , came to Mexico in 1909 . He had gone there against his will because he had planned to leave the company to establish a law practice . However , his knowledge of Spanish as well as his broad experience in all branches of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Mexican business . When Jones first went to Mexico , L. L. Ward , a veteran Wells Fargo man who had been with the company in Mexico City for a number of years , was president of the Mexican organization . Unfortunately Ward was not destined to hold the post many months . He fell seriously ill , went to Rochester , Minnesota , for a major operation , and died there . He was succeeded by Elmer R. Jones , in 1910 . Jones has been president of Wells , Fargo and Company , Express , S.A. , ever since . When Jones went to Mexico City in 1909 he rented an apartment near the castle of Chapultepec , took a corner office on the upper floor of the fine old house of the Duke of Albuquerque and set to work further to develop Wells Fargo 's Mexican business , which at that time operated not only on the lines of the British-owned Mexican Railway but on those of the Mexican National Railway system and some smaller roads . Those were the final days of President Diaz ' regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a pleasant , sleepy national  | capital , situated on a level plain 7,300 feet above the sea , and cupped in by magnificent mountains , forever snow-capped , chief of all Iztacchivatl , " The sleeping woman " and Popocatepetl . With the Mexican Revolution of 1910 Diaz and the things for which he stood collapsed . Wells Fargo held firm , and Elmer Jones remained on the scene . At the risk of his life he went everywhere in war-torn Mexico , seeing to it that the many interests of Wells , Fargo and Company were protected . Once in the days when Pancho Villa ruled the mesas , Elmer Jones was traveling with two or three companions on horseback across the northern state of Durango . They suddenly came face to face with a little group of men also mounted . Hardlooking customers , these were obviously guerrillas . They gave no pleasant salute , but at once raised their guns . " Viva Villa ? " they queried . " Viva Estados Unidos ? " Elmer Jones thought quickly . It was no moment for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viva Wells Fargo , " was his instant reply . They dropped their guns and came forward , smiling , to shake hands with the gringos . Once again Wells Fargo had averted a crisis . But the situation in Mexico grew no better . The revolution became a series of revolutions . President followed president : Madero , Huerta , Villa , Obregon , Calles and others , an all-butendless succession of names . At one time there were no fewer than three armies in and around the capital : Huerta , who was in the capital ; Pancho Villa , who was battling to get in from the north ; and Guitterez , who finally joined forces with Villa . In all this hubbub and confusion Wells Fargo kept on the jeb and Jones found it necessary to spend more and more time in Mexico City . Despite the revolution , the company continued to make money , but what to do with the cash , gold and silver bullion became the problem in these constantly recurring crises . Jones looked around headquarters in the ancient palace of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , patio , he found what he thought would be a safe resting place for the company 's  | treasure . He lifted the paving stones , dug a deep hole , and in it placed the safes with gold , silver , bank-notes and valuable papers of all kinds , and then replaced the paving stones . At one time in 1913 during the Huerta regime he had buried $756,000 of company funds under the pavement . He did the job himself , with the aid of two or three trusted assistants . Even so word leaked out . A day or two later he was summoned to the president 's office in the National Palace . The Presidente smiled and said that the government was to issue bonds the following . day and that he should like Wells Fargo to subscribe for $756,000 of the $13,000,000 issue . Jones smiled too . He bought the bonds ; they were good , and the company has them to this day . Always in those days it was a struggle to retain the profits that were made . Elmer Jones recalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars worth of silver bars were being rushed on the railroad to Vera Cruz , in those days generally under the protection of American warships . The two baggage cars , with their silver freight , did not get through to Vera Cruz . Word came finally that there had been a wreck down the line in a rough and unpopulated region of the country ; just one of those nasty wrecks that Mexican railways always seemed to be having . At the time Wells Fargo had its own good secret service man in Mexico , Captain Giacamino Canotti , a former officer of the Italian Army , who in the Diaz days also had been a captain in the Mexican forces . Canotti went to work on the case . He scoured the entire line and finally reported to Elmer Jones that he had located the two cars . They had been wrecked , surely enough , and thrown from the tracks halfway down the line . And they were empty . At the time General Emiliano Zapata was in command of the armies in that part of Mexico . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian zarape ( blanket ) near the little San Lazare station on the outskirts of the capital where the railroad had its terminal . Zapata was cordial , and said that he would help el presidente of Wells Fargo . He put a whole company of troops at Canotti 's disposal and they found all the missing bars ; all save two which later were found under  | the body of a dead burro upon a mountainside not far from the peak of Orizaba . One thing remained . There had been a single bar of pure gold , valued at about $45,000 , American money . To find that single missing nugget in a land as vast and with as many unpopulated areas as Mexico was no easy task . But Jones and George A. O'Brien of Wells Fargo and Canotti went at it . Eventually they unearthed it in an hacienda shed near San Luis Potosi , 30o miles north of Mexico City . Gradually the men who had stolen the bullion were apprehended and punished . Wells Fargo never forgets ! The episode that Elmer Jones most clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . It was in December , 1914 , when Pancho Villa was rapidly closing in on the capital . Villa was in his headquarters in a private car on a railroad siding at Tacuba about fifteen miles out of the city and had telegraphed the president of Wells Fargo that he wished to see him . Jones , with O'Brien , went out to Tacuba at once . Villa received the two Wells Fargo officers graciously . He smiled and reminded Senor Jones that he , too , had once worked for Wells Fargo . He had been a muleteer for the company , bringing the silver down out of the mines back of Durango . He smiled again . It occurred to him , he said , that it was high time that Wells Fargo operated on the railroads in the northern states of the republic that he had ? to use a pleasant word ? taken over . He repeated the suggestion . Jones again did some quick thinking . He said that he would have to consult with the directors of the company in Mexico City . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would see them again in three days . A hurried meeting of the Wells Fargo directors was called . The directors ? all save Jones ? were against the Villa suggestion . Villa had not yet entered the city which was still occupied by Vittoria Huerta . They did not see how Wells Fargo could work for two opposing governments at the same time . Jones and O'Brien returned to General Villa ? Jones says frankly that he was now in great fear ? and reported that Wells  | Fargo could not operate over the railway lines that had been seized by Villa in the north . Pancho Villa was enraged . He turned to the aide near by and commanded : " Call the guard . " Elmer Jones turned to O'Brien and said in English : " They 'll shoot us , George ! " Villa ignored that remark . He spoke no English . He turned to Jones and roared : " You have bought Huerta 's bonds . The bankers have bought Huerta 's bonds . I am going to shoot all of you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Brien , again in English . Villa 's rage now knew no bounds . His face grew purple . He stamped his feet on the floor . In Spanish he shouted : " No English spoken in this car . You men are to be shot . Call the guard . " Six rough soldiers strode into the car . Elmer Jones could feel his heart pound . George O'Brien was having none too happy a time of it . Each man was seized by three soldiers , taken to another car and placed at opposite ends of it . No communication was permitted between them . Some time in the course of the evening the car began to move . Blinds were closely drawn and it would have meant death to touch them . But the two Wells Fargo men knew the territory pretty well , and after the car had stopped on the very outskirts of the city and six more prisoners placed inside , it was shunted over to the Cuernavaca line , the steep little railroad that leads up past the chief cemetery of the city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an appropriate place for executions . Saved a lot of work with hearses or camions . One by one the six poor devils , accused of one crime or another ? most of them were counterfeiters ? were taken out of the car . Jones and O'Brien counted six shots and awaited their turns . For some reason they were not taken out . Toward dawn they were hauled right into Mexico City . The car came to a halt in the yard of the old Buena Vista station : Jones and O'Brien
