On an October day a year ago , pert WAVE Ensign Marie Thompson stood on an East Coast airfield and with a kiss for all hands sent 36 Navy flyers off to the Pacific . They were the pilots of Fighting Squadron Two . Last week WAVE Thompson had the news that all but four of the boys she had kissed goodbye were on their way home , that the squadron had made one of the great combat records of the war . <P> Young and Cocky . Fighting Two started out with young and cocky confidence . Their emblem was a green dragon tearing a Jap flag to shreds . " Mom " Chung , the servicemen 's devoted foster mother in San Francisco ( TIME , Sept. 11 ) , had designed it for them , especially for their leader , Commander William A. Dean Jr . They called themselves the " Rippers . " <P> They first encountered reality at Makin . They did not distinguish themselves . After Kwajalein they were packed back to Pearl Harbor to rejoin their own group for more training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time with their bomber and torpedo squadron colleagues of Air Group Two , aboard an Essex-class carrier . <P> Hard luck dogged them . Thomas L. Morrissey , non-flying officer , who faith fully kept a diary , noted on March 18 : <P> " This afternoon . . . two of our fighters collided . . . . " Both pilots were killed . The rest of the brooding Rippers went on to fight at Palau and Woleai . <P> Top of the War . Their carrier task force moved south to the New Guinea theater and struck Hollandia , moved north east for strikes at Truk , Satawan and Ponape . Still the Rippers were no better than any mine-run fighter squadron . In early June the task force went north to lend a hand in the invasion of the Marianas . There the squadron found itself . <P> On June 11 , the Skipper , Bill Dean , led them over Guam and Rota . That day , for the first time , the Rippers flew on top of the war . June 19 Wilbur ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dive bombers circling to land on Guam and knocked off six , ending his rampage with only one gun still working . On that day the Rippers got 51 planes in aerial combat , a record which the Rippers shattered themselves five days later by shooting down 67 planes over Iwo Jima . <P> The Veterans . They added Ulithi , Min danao , Morotai , Halmahera and Manila to their battles and scores of enemy planes to their tally . They fought now with confidence born of experience , shepherded the bombers with cool , cocky precision . <P> One day Leroy ( " Tex " ) Harris , escorting the bombers over Davao Gulf , reported by radio that they had spotted a Jap destroyer . Tex radioed blithely : " Wait about five minutes and I 'll tell you where it was-repeat was . " Less than five minutes later the bombers had sunk the destroyer . <P> The Record . Last month they knew they were flying their last missions as a squadron . They sweated it out , as all flyers do when home is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and three children in California . Mike Wolfe thought of the baby daughter he had never seen , Earling Zaeske of his new son . They also thought of the baby daughter Demarest Lloyd had never seen and never would . Said the squadron diary : " Bernie McLaughlin landed from combat air patrol and announced that he had figured it out over Morotai that there are 84 shopping days to Christmas . "
