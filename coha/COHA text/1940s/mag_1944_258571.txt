At Brest , Lorient and Saint-Nazaire , Germans still held out , but elsewhere in Brittany German resistance was battered down . This week the besieged ports were more than ever prizes worth the price in casualties and time ; their deep harbors were sorely needed for the vast stream of supplies to the swiftly expanding Allied front in northern France . <P> Allied communiques were silent on progress before the bastions , mentioned only repeated air attacks upon the U-boat pens . <P> Last week the Americans broke down one stubborn fortress , secured a minor port . Stiff-backed Colonel Andreas von Auloch , the " madman of Saint-Malo , " finally surrendered . Begrimed ( but with boots shining ) , proud of their stand ( but reeling after a farewell bout with the bottle ) , the Germans gave up after eleven days of pounding . Before they marched out of their tunneled redoubt the Germans freed seven U.S. prisoners . The Americans had been treated well , had scarcely noticed the air bombardments in the four-story-deep granite fortress . <P> Auloch was the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign and they made the most of him . Berlin recited his final message to Adolf Hitler : " Further resistance had to cease as a result of lack of food . " It trumpeted the Fhrer 's reply : " Your name will go down in history forever . " <P> Berlin insisted that Auloch himself had not surrendered , no matter what the Allies said , but the U.S. press had evidence convincing enough even for the Herrenvolk ( see cut ) .
