Addressing the C.I.O. executive board assembled in Washington , C.I.O. President Phil Murray said : " It is not for me to tell you what to do . " <P> But , in a way , Phil Murray did . He wanted to get the Henry Wallace issue out in the open , and , if possible , get it settled . He asked the board to approve a resolution condemning a third-party presidential campaign . Such a campaign , he said , " bodes nothing but ill for labor . " <P> This , as Phil Murray knew it would , set off one of the most savage debates the C.I.O. has ever known . Harry Bridges , Communist-line boss of 75,000 West Coast longshoremen , cried out : " I 'm against this phony resolution ! There 's nothing for labor to do but back Wallace . " <P> The U.A.W. 's Walter Reuther undertook to answer : " The Reds are up to their old trick of creating confusion . Nobody is deceived . " <P> For nine hours , the hot words flew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 33 to 11 . Then Phil Murray did something he had never done before . He made the left-wingers stand up and be counted . If the time ever came-and it might come before the 1948 campaign was over - when Phil Murray felt it necessary to boot these left-wingers out of the C.I.O. , he would have a black &; white record to use against the likes of Harry Bridges , the Transport Workers ' Mike Quill and the United Electrical Workers ' Al Fitzgerald . <P> Even so , the left-wingers insisted that they would never abandon Henry Wallace . And they knew that , no matter what Phil Murray did , their ten big unions ( with roughly 1,000,000 members ) could make things rough for the C.I.O. 's Political Action Committee and for Harry Truman . Snorted Harry Bridges : " The Democratic Party has n't the chance of a snowball in hell . "
