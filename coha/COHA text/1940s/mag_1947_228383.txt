A Chip for Our Shoulder ? <P> Sir : <P> I am a high-school senior who will graduate this spring . We would not object to giving a year of military service to our country if we felt such service necessary . We have our doubts , however . <P> You stated TIME , June 9 that the proposed cost of a U.M.T. program would amount to nearly $2 billion annually . We wonder what would happen if we doubled our educational program . Two billion dollars yearly would almost do that . We wonder how far $2 billion would go towards feeding the hungry peoples of the world . Could a lasting peace be established if $2 billion yearly were given to the church for advancing Christianity in foreign lands ? . . . Would $2 billion lick cancer ? . . <P> ALLYN F. ROBERTS <P> Marquette , Mich . <P> <P> Sir : <P> It seems to me incredibly crazy to waste billions of dollars and millions of man-years on anything so stupid and negative as the proposed U.M.T. program . <P> It is admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombing over Germany could be accomplished in a matter of hours in the next war . Yet , under the U.M.T. plan , it would take a year to mobilize " an effective force of around 7,500,000 ! " It appears , then , that having a nation of men with basic training would be useless , for under atomic , chemical and bacterial invasion we could never get them mobilized ! <P> Why ca n't we be reasonable ? Let us stop insulting the rest of the world . Let us stop wasting priceless energy and billions in wealth merely to build a larger chip for our shoulder . ( History has proved that the world will not be intimidated . ) Let 's apply that energy and wealth to making friends ; to lending a helping hand ; to being honestly sincere in striving for peace on earth . Let 's abolish the hypocrisy that 's leading us all to our foolish destruction . <P> <P> LEONARD PRICE Baltimore <P> Five Greatest Living Composers <P> Sir : <P> TIME 'S piece on Dmitri Shostakovich TIME , June 9 dogmatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the others : Sergei Prokofiev , Richard Strauss , Igor Stravinsky , Jean Sibelius ) . . . . " <P> ... If Shostakovich belongs among the " big five , " how about Hindemith , Milhaud , Vaughan Williams , Ives and half a dozen others ? <P> Had TIME said " most grandiose , " " most played " or " most publicized , " it would have been on the mark . But " greatest ? " May I quote two less gullible judgments which , I believe , are fairly representative of competent critical opinion outside of Russia ? <P> " If imagination in Berlioz ' vein can be confused with eloquence , Shostakovich is an eloquent composer-eloquent perhaps in the manner of the political orator , of the haranguer of the masses , which , indeed , for him seems to be a desirable aim . " - Adolfo Salazar , Music in Our Time . <P> " The depth of great art does not exist for one moment in the work of Shostakovich , only the spirit , the colored robe and the sparkling flexibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> JOHN H. HARVEY St. Paul <P> Degrees of gullibility are hard to determine-in New York , Moscow or St. Paul. - ED . <P> The Colonel 's Hat <P> Sir :
