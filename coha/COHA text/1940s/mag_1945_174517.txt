The State of New York , long used to pacing the Union in matters of social legislation , this week struck out on what may prove its most ambitious stride . The legislature passed and Governor Dewey signed a bill to outlaw employment discrimination because of race , creed , color , or national origin . <P> The new law , providing for a permanent five-man commission to decide cases of individuals who claim to have been unjustly discharged or denied jobs , was enthusiastically backed by the state 's churchmen , the C.I.O. , A.F. of L. and a host of other organizations . Said Governor Dewey : " Passage of the bill ... is an historic step . I am happy indeed that our state has led the nation . . . . " <P> But the bill did not go unopposed . The powerful Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen , which has an anti-Negro clause in its constitution , fought hard from an extremely awkward position . So did the State Chamber of Commerce and the State Bar Association . They and other opponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings that bring discrimination about . Some employers went so far as to prophesy that New York 's industries would move out and leave it a ghost state . <P> If industries did go so far as to move out of New York , they were likely to find fewer &; fewer frankly discriminatory states to move into . Anti-discrimination measures like the New York law are under consideration in Massachusetts , New Jersey , Connecticut , Pennsylvania , Illinois , Ohio , Michigan and California .
