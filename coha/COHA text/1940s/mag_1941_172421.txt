Of the 883 U.S. radio stations , newspaper publishers own 294 and are busily engaged in trying to expand their holdings via Frequency Modulation . In the eyes of the New Deal , which has often made clear that it does n't like newspapers and does like radio , this is very bad business . Last week in Manhattan able , soft-spoken Mark Ethridge , vice president and general manager of the Louisville Courier-Journal and Louisville Times and former president of the National Association of Broadcasters , reported to his fellow publishers what his committee had been able to find out about the Government 's plans . <P> Quite cold was the turkey Mr. Ethridge dished up . Last month the Federal Communications Commission ordered hearings held to determine whether joint control of radio stations and newspapers results in " an impairment of radio service . " However friendly the hearings , Mark Ethridge pointed out , publishers would have no easy time making a winning case for their radio activities . To make sure their side was well presented , the publishers agreed to raise $200,000 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissident to the committee 's program was Robert McCormick 's WGN which , like Robert McCormick 's Chicago Tribune , is an industrial lone ranger . <P> As outlined by Chairman James Lawrence Fly , the FCC hearings will try to show the bad effect of one-sided opinion on a community where all channels of information are concentrated in one ownership . <P> Busy last week in Washington was Maine 's Senator Wallace H. White Jr. , co-author of the original Radio Act of 1927 , pondering a bill calling for the reorganization of FCC and an investigation of its activities . Senator White tirelessly points out that FCC was set up merely as a licensing body , views with alarm its New Dealish tendency to use the power to license as a power to reform . Should Senator White introduce a reorganization bill before FCC goes to work on the publishers , the Commission may find itself too busy covering its own chin to throw any punches at the publishers . <P> In any case , FCC will have to egg-walk around many political considerations when it begins its hearings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dixie , 125 are owned by newspapers , nearly all of which are Democratic . Among Administration friends who may be put on the spot : Jesse Jones ( Houston Chronicle , KTRH ) , Amon Carter ( Fort Worth Star-Telegram , WBAP , KGKO ) , James M. Cox ( Dayton , Ohio News ; Springfield , Ohio News ; Springfield , Ohio Sun ; Miami , Fla . News ; Atlanta Journal ; WHIG , Dayton , Ohio ; WIOD , Miami , Fla. ; WSB , Atlanta , Ga . ) . <P> Last fortnight , despite FCC 's reluctance about granting licenses to publishers , Jesse Jones was given a green light to increase the power of his Chronicle station , KTRH , in Houston . He is one of three exceptions to the FCC 's policy of holding newspaper applications until after its hearings .
