Building a tank is one thing ; keeping it going is another . Last week the nation 's No. 1 arms manufacturer went to work on problem No. 2 . General Motors Corp. , holder of 10-12% of all U.S. arms contracts , set up a great maintenance school . Purpose : to keep its products-whether machine guns , tanks or aircraft engines-functioning in the field . <P> To repair damage by the enemy , and plain wear- &-tear; on far-flung fields , where trees are often makeshift hoists for ailing airplane engines , and a jungle clearing is the only repair shop , G.M. got set to learn a lesson that the aircraft industry had already learned . The lesson : for battlefield and back-of-the-line repairs , technicians must be cracks and they must be resourceful . A mechanic who can patch up tanks at the front , far away from well-equipped shops , needs as much in his head as in his hands . <P> To produce mechanics who will not need a bookshelf on the battlefield , G.M. tapped its engineering vice president , Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5,000,000 . He had a working model in his own organization : G.M. 's Allison engine division has already turned out more than 800 U.S. , Canadian , British , New Zealand and Chinese aircraft-engine mechanics , has a capacity of 71 more a month and is ready to expand . <P> The maintenance of Allisons is only one volume in G.M. 's new five-foot shelf . The corporation now makes another brand of aircraft engines ( Pratt &; Whitneys under license ) , Diesels for tanks , trucks and light cars in a score of sizes , guns , shells and tanks . Like all big-league war contractors , G.M. recognizes the wisdom in a new principle of warfare : " That army finally wins which has the best remnants . " To make U.S. remnants the best , G.M. began training instructors for 20 products at its Institute in Flint , Mich . <P> Students will be trained in four different kinds of maintenance work under the armed services ' Four Echelon System . First echelon is the men who operate equipment in the field : plane crews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from light-repair units , usually mobile . Third : men in semi-mobile shops where major repairs and replacements-e.g. , patching up badly cracked airplanes-are made . Fourth echelon : permanent overhaul depots , which must be set up , preferably out of bomb range , behind the lines in Australia , India , China , Eritrea-wherever U.S. engines fight . <P> For all the echelons , manpower is short , in spite of immense Army &; Navy training programs . But for contractors like G.M. , who start their own schools , there is a great gain in sight , beyond the immediate military service its students will give . Graduates of the schools will also be G.M. performance observers . Their reports to the home factories from the fields of war should be the best of all foundations for improvements to make tanks last longer , aircraft fly higher , guns hit harder .
