ALmost certainly some day this week when the Treasury Department in Washington opens its morning mail it will receive a letter like this one : CONFIDENTIAL . Secretary of the Treasury , Washington , D. C. Sir : Would the government be interested in recovering 8 chests of gold , valued at $72,000,000 , buried in certain waters in the State of Florida at 8 to 12 feet depth ? My associate has the maps and knows the location ; however , at this time I can not go into further detail , as our very lives would be in jeopardy should the information become public . The mail clerks of the department will route this letter to a division with the unromantic name of Bookkeeping &; Warrants . Here , answer being made , it will be put into a large collection of documents known unofficially as the " treasure trove file . " This file exists ( and has existed for decades ) because all Americans are apparently incorrigible treasure hunters at heart , and because , whether you knew it or not , treasure hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I paid a visit to these files , spending I am reluctant to admit how many days among them . And now what I know ! I think I could set myself up as a treasure trove counselor . I know where there is a wagon load of gold in a swamp in Wisconsin . It was concealed from an Indian attack and sankin the quicksands . I can tell you where $350,000 in octagonal fifty-dollar gold pieces lies buried in a few feet of sand and water . I can even advise you where to find within eight miles of Times Square , New York , $4,000,000 in gold coins ( in kegs ) and in pounds sterling . I should say that I know where in the United States just about all the big hoards lie . But perhaps better still , I can tell you what the problems and worries of treasure seekers are . I would almost maintain that from these files I now know them all . Dear Mr. Secretary : from Arizona If a man was to dig up 10 or 20 thousand dollars in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to give to the United States Treasury ? I am close on to a good pot , so let me hear from you soon . There 's worry number one . The treasure trove file is bursting with letters containing that inquiry . The basic law behind this worry runs back to medieval times , when the sovereign claimed half of all treasure trove . There is a widespread belief that our government , following this feudal precedent , must have fifty per cent of all treasure found . However , the treasure hunter can get a better deal today . The Secretary of the Treasury may make whatever division he wishes ; the law says that he may make whatever agreement he deems " just and reasonable . " It has on occasion been seventy-five per cent for the finder . It has been even ninety . Two other ever-nagging treasure hunter problems , I found , are expressed in this rather quaint inquiry from a Californian : To Hon. Henry Morgenthau : I know there is a law for hoaring ( sic ) Gold , but if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law would not apply to him , would it ? I have heard of Bankers that told men if they found money in Gold Coins that they could not get it changed by the Government . What should I do with any Gold of this hidden treasure kind ? And second , if I want to dig up an old ship with silver bars laid on the valt floor and ostralan Gold Coins packed in 4 pound packages and wropped in mail sacks , can I get a contract with the Govment to protect my rights ? Please answer soon , for I want to be gone as soon as I hear from you. ? William " Bonanza " Sikes , prospector and salvager . What Mr. Sikes gets in answer , I have to report , is something like this : Sir : Reference is made to Executive Orders of April 5 and August 28 , 1933 ; Order of Secretary of the Treasury , December 28 , 1933 ; and the Gold Reserve Act of 1943 ; copies of which will be forwarded for your perusal . Any gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury Department and the circumstances fully stated in order that specific instructions relative thereto may be given . As to your query regarding a contract with the government , you are respectfully informed that under Sect. 3755 of Rev. Stat. of 1878 , U.S.C. , Title 40 , Section 310 , the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to make such contracts and provisions as he may deem for the interest of the government , for the preservation , sale , or collection of any property , or the proceeds thereof , which may have been wrecked , abandoned , or become derelict , being within the jurisdiction of the United States , and which ought to come to the United States ; and on this matter you may care to examine the following cases and opinions of the Attorney General : Russell v. Forty Bales Cotton , ( D.C. Fla. 1872 ) 21 Fed . Case No. 12154 ; U. S. v. Tyndale ( Mass. 1902 ) 116 Fed . 828 , .54 C.C.A . 324 ; ( 1870 ) 13 Op . Atty . Gen. 569 ; ( 1900 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Administrative Assistant to the Secretary . There is nothing in the treasure trove files which reveals Mr. Sikes ' remarks on receipt of this communication . R. SIKES ' difficulties notwithstand-ing , it is not impossible for the treasure hunter to get a contract with the Treasury Department , giving him exclusive rights to search for certain lost treasure . It is true that the treasure trove files show the government writing thus on occasion : " The Treasury Department issues no permits to search for hidden treasure , has no information in regard to such matters , and can only suggest that queries be addressed to some local attorney . " Yet the Department has made contracts with treasure seekers from time to time . A rather recent example was an agreement with Simon Lake giving him exclusive right to seek gold on an old British treasure frigate . But , as policy , the department is cool toward such contracts . Once or twice it has been duped by scalawags . To contract seekers , I can give this valuable tip : no stock or bond issues to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me finance this search ? " is another idea constantly in every treasure hunter 's mind . The answer is No . However , some of the propositioning is pretty artful and tempting . Like the North Carolinian who wonders " if it would be necessary for me to supply the vessel and gear " ? when he shows department officials where the gold Treasury of the Confederacy lies buried . He says he knows where it is to within a foot , in Virginia . But commonest of all , the treasure trove file shows , is the treasure-hunting American who can not sleep at night because he knows positively the approximate location of hidden loot but can not pinpoint it because he has n't " a machine . " " I want a magnetic instrument , " declares a north Georgia man , " for detecting underground treasures such as those hoarded away and the parties dead and out of reach . " And a citrus farmer in Texas , has just located a ship on Padre Island ? Spanish ? sixteenth century ? eight tons of fifty-pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive . But sanded over by another storm . " A radio machine , the best the government can recommend , " he says , " is what I need just awfully now . " The treasure hunters believe in these machines , too . They say that there is one in process of development by Westinghouse which will give the searcher the measurements of whatever keg , cask , or old sea chest the treasure is buried in . But such machines are often at the mercy of " conditions " which keep them from locating the hidden hoard . If other metal is lying around , off they go on the wrong scent . Or there is " too much ore in the ground , " or there is trouble from " the salt deposit in the sand strata above the gold , " or this type of machine just simply does n't register in depth . " Well , why would n't a " machine " have a tough job ? A million dollars in gold ills only a small steamer trunk . I HAVE already said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to elaborate a little on that statement now . The treasure trove file is overflowing with inquiries about " lost " mines . Lost in Texas , Arizona , and New Mexico , mainly . Americans yearly , by the hundreds , invest their time and money to look for them . A sample ? a favorite ? is the Lost Dutchman in Arizona . This mine was first " found " by a treasure hunter named Jacob Walz , nicknamed Old Snowbeard the Dutchman . Long before him , according to church records in Mexico , this mine had yielded millions of pesos in gold . Then it was " lost " in the Apache uprising . Old Snowbeard died without leaving any clue as to its location . But there is a suspicion : the Superstition Mountains , not far from Phoenix . Well , would you believe it ? every year over 7,000 Americans conduct searches just for that one mine ? Or consider the business of the professional salvage companies . Their letters pepper the treasure trove files from way back and show very frequently today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not long ago sucked up from the Panama Mail ship Columbia , foundered in 1931 off Lower California , a cool $190,000 in gold bullion . As treasures go , that is small change . These files tell of a Spanish galleon , the Santa Rosa , which sailed from Mexico in 1520 in June ? loaded with Aztec gold , the ransom Montezuma paid Cortez . She lies off Key West , crusted over with coral now but definitely identified ; and the treasure she carried has been estimated at$30,000,000 . If the estimates are correct , and if the treasure could be recovered , that would be nice business for somebody . You wonder if treasure hunting is a paying industry ? Some records from Florida might show you something . There over a stretch of years two and a quarter million dollars was spent in treasure searches , and over three and a half million was recovered . The figures include only investments and returns which were published ? in historical records or the press . So bath are probably low . Further , a common estimate is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain 35 sunken wrecks and buried caches , over $170,000,000 in potential dividends lies waiting for the finders . Truly the treasure trove files reveal Florida as the dream of all treasure seekers . Pulse rising , I have read on a scrap of ancient stationery that at Apalachicola under the lagoon bar is a Gulf pirate ship filled with loot and gold ore . Near Cross City lie buried eight barrels of money hidden by two Bahamian traders just before Andrew Jackson hanged them for inciting the Seminoles . De Soto , did you know , recorded burying treasure at Silver Springs ? Old British coins keep popping up among the sand and Spanish bayonet near the Suwanee on Bumblebee Island , because British payship officers hid away a chest there from an enemy privateer . And under Steinhatchee River 's mouth is a Civil War blockade runner 's $500,000 in bar silver . About $90,000 to raise it , the salvage companies say . If you happen to have $90,000 . . . . Some treasure hunters have had that , and more . The Treasury files indicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a sample , the effort to raise a ship named the Merida . A Ward Liner sunk by a United Fruit boat in 1911 off Cape Charles , Virginia , she had come from Vera Cruz , where revolution-fleeing agents of Porfirio Diaz had brought aboard her $5,000,000 in bar gold and silver and the rubies of the state jewel collection from the crown of Maximilian , the former Emperor . Her first salvagers , in 1916 , were Percy Rockefeller , Charles Sabin , Albert H. Wiggin , and Company , who employed twelve divers , but unsuccessfully . In 1924 Anthony J. Drexel Biddle , Jr. , Roswell C. Tripp , Worthington Davis , and associated treasure hunters took another crack at her with two trawlers and the famous Danish diver Fred Nielsen , who found and positively identified her . That night a storm shifted the ocean floor over her . In 1936 the treasure was sought again ? financed by the New York Salvage Company . In ' 38- ' 39 the diver ship Falco raked the deep for her in a $100,000 try ? paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasure are surely still down there . The Italian ship fished up one of her silver ingots ( value : $7.20 ! ) . As a treasure trove counselor , I would say she is still a good Grade B prospect . FROM those government files I know of some better ones , though . For instance , as a blue chip project , I might recommend a certain lost mine in Texas , in San Saba County , It has several names : Lost Bowie Mine , Lost Almagres , but most often ? the San Saba . That treasure case begins with a Spanish mission on the San Saba River , northwest of San Antonio , in the 1750 's , and a Spanish garrison a few miles away ; the latter , it is known , was there to protect a silver-mining operation which both legend and record indicated to be of fabulous production . The Indians drove the Spaniards out of the region , the accounts have it , and they had to leave much of the mined and molded silver behind . James Bowie , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of this mine . Written record shows that he set out to find it on November 2 , 1831 , got into an Indian fight , and returned to San Antonio . He set out for the mine again , but never found it , interrupted by Texas ' war for independence and his death at the Alamo . Belief in the lost San Saba 's existence persists in a thousand stories . There was the settler 's son whom the Comanches captured and took to where they molded bullets from silver pebbles in a cave . When they got drunk , he escaped , but in MAGAZINE that trackless region could never find the cave again . The Comanches , he believed , had earthed it over before being driven out of the region for good by the White Man . But any day some treasure hunter might stumble on the place again . And find the San Saba silver still there ? Well , among San Saba references in the treasure trove files is this : " Mexico City records showed that $33,000,000 in silver bullion was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any treasure trove counselor would recommend would be the ships De Break and Brother Jonathan . One was a British warship capsized off Lewes , Delaware ; the other an old American sidewheeler now on the bottom off California . From the De Break 's treasure trove file you can learn everything that has ever been done to raise the treasure aboard her and just what the treasure was . She tipped over in a May squall in 1798 , because she carried 70 tons of badly stowed copper , with ? 80,000 sterling and $10,000,000 of loot from five prize Spanish galleons . A British frigate later slipped chains under her , believing she could haul her up on the rising tide . Too heavy , the De Break snapped all the chains . In 1880 the Americans ( International Submarine Company , of New Haven ) grappled and suctioned for her . Teak came up . The De Break 's wood , all right ? but no gold . In 1935 C. N. Colstad &; Company , Massachusetts engineers , advised the Treasury Department they would do the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , power hoists and jetting pumps " ; it would cost only $20,000 , This plan came to naught , too . But within twelve months a storm flung up old Spanish coins on the proximate Delaware beaches . From the De Braak ? The natives around thought so . They believe the ship and her treasure are somewhere near the Cape Henlopen shore now . p ROBABLY the treasure trove case record of the Brother Jonathan is the only one that ever began in an annual report of a government department . The Treasury 's report for 1865 describes how the ship left San Francisco July 28 , struck a rock , and sank off Crescent City . Major E. W. Eddy , Additional Paymaster , U. S : Army ; in charge of $200,000 in government funds , was drowned . Sixty-one years later , in 1926 , in the Department files , the treasure seekers are hot on the trail of that $200,000 . " We believe we can locate and recover the money , " one clamors ; " please advise how much of it was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bookkeeping &; Warrants writes General Accounting for the answer . Back come photostats . A clerk , pay department , U. S. Army , testifies that he assisted Major E. W. Eddy in counting and sealing , in an iron box , the $200,000 , " which were in U. S. Treasury notes . " The Assistant Secretary ( Ogden Mills ) then advises to that effect , adding gratuitously that the notes must have been destroyed by the sea water long ere now . That would end the matter , you might think . But you do n't know treasure hunters . This one writes back : not all the money aboard could have been affected by sea water . The Bureau of Engraving and Printing and the Bureau of Standards are called in to buttress the Treasury 's opinion . All agree : disintegration . So the Treasury Department " rests . " us treasure hunters never rest . And B the records show them pounding away month after month on that big question : What kind of money was on the Jonathan ? The answers are more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But one day in 1931 comes something from a Secret Service agent which stirs up all the doubts again . This man has just been advised by a San Pedro salvage company official that the Brother Jonathan carried $800,000 in gold ; that $365,000 of this was government funds en route to Oregon ; that instruments indicate the existence in the wreck , today , of a large sum of gold . " There is no record that the government money was gold , " the Department writes the salvage company . The treasure searchers rebut : " Understand Indian Agent William Logan aboard with gold specie to pay to Oregon Indians for treaties recently signed . " Indians belong to the Department of the Interior . The question is referred there ; and Interior is back in about two weeks with this discouraging answer : " The Superintendent of Indian Affairs in Oregon reported in 1865 that Agent Logan had with him $10,000 in notes , from the Assistant Treasurer in San Francisco . " So the Brother Jonathan 's golden ghost is laid . You think so ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sir : A marine diver friend of mine has definitely Located the Brother Jonathan . The Federal Reserve Bank here in San Francisco says that the old Sub-Treasury records have been removed to Washington . I would like full information on the specie aboard the Brother Jonathan , and whether transmitted through a bank or express company . The Treasury answers : " No . No record of any gold . " But this treasure hunter is a man of mettle and comes back punching . Sirs : Unofficially the following are reported to have been taken from the Sub-Treasury to said vessel : $350,000 ? in $50 gold slugs ( octagonal ) to General William Logan , Indian Agent for the N/W tribes . $200,000 ? legal tender to Major E. W. Eddy . $500,000 ? in U. S. gold coin to Mr. Lord , Express Agent , Wells Fargo &; Co. , for a British Syndicate . All book and paper records of the U. S. Treasury and the express company were destroyed in the fire and quake of 1906 . It is imperative that I receive confirmation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . May I ask that you get action in this matter ? Impatient ( and what treasure hunter is n't ? ) , three days later this Californian is needling the Department again . Sirs : For years there has persisted in official circles the story of two or three funds in gold coin on the Brother Jonathan . These may not have been funds of the U. S. Government . Without doubt they were withdrawn from the Sub-Treasury by banks such as Well Fargo &; Co. , or Bank of California , or Bank of British Columbia . And so the gentleman would like " the custodians of the records to pick up items of withdrawals from the San Francisco Sub-Treasury on or before July 28 , 1865 , for shipment to Oregon . " To solve the mystery ! But a few days later the Treasury has regrets : that it is unable to state whether or not gold was withdrawn from the Sub-Treasury for shipment to Oregon the year the Brother Jonathan went down . The reason : the old records of the Sub-Treasury are not available ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress authorizing the disposition of useless papers . " And probably they were , probably they were . But the list of papers submitted ( in 1929 ) for authority for destruction , the treasure trove file will show you , went back only to 1880 . There is no evidence , except by inference , that the 1865 records had been destroyed previously . There is no government record which says definitely that the 1865 papers were destroyed and how and when and where . So the mystery ( was there gold , was n't there ? ) is to treasure hunters still unsolved . The wreck is still there , her contents unretrieved . And now a Treasury Department letter , saying the government will take no salvage action , adds the clause : " unless hereafter it should be ascertained that it the Jonathan contained gold belonging to the government " ! If the gold was on board , it is today anyone 's to try and find . IV F INALLY we come to the classic of the treasure trove files ? the case of the Hussar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great scientist , Buck Rogers search equipment , and the most bizarre of locations ? off the Bronx shore at 135th Street , New York City ! The Hussar was a 28-gun , 114-foot British man-of-war . She had arrived , one November day in 1780 , with funds for British troops fighting in the American Revolution , to find that New York was being evacuated ; so she was ordered , shortly , to proceed to Newport . She got only to Pot Rock , a ledge then in the East River off Ward Island . The current from Hell Gate ( known then as Hurl Gate , incidentally ) is swift here and loosened the Hussar from the rock , but leaking badly . Her captain then ran her straight for a small river which emptied out just below what is now 135th Street , unaware of a reef which could not be crossed at ebb tide . The Hussar split her hull wide open and sank like a plummet . MAGAZINE What funds were aboard ? small or great ? And where was it ? The treasure trove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , estimates , and alleged evidence from that day to this . The money , some reports say , was stored in kegs in the lower hold under chalk ballast which had been put on at Dover in England . And did she take on additional money here ? Well , the treasure trove files reveal that one Samuel Becker of 81 Water Street , published a certificate in 1819 that the ship Hussar " did , from the British Pay Office on Cherry Street , take away 14 cartloads , of iron chests of silver coins , and small kegs containing gold coin emptied into 4 chests , and carted to Beekman 's Wharf and put on board , and sailed immediately . " But how much ? Well , the most persistent , thorough , and scientific of all the Hussar 's treasure hunters estimated the sum at close to $4,800,000 . Whatever the amount , it must have been big , for the British would be the ones to know , and they were the first to try to salvage it . There were four tries before 1840 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship 's tableware , a seal used for burning initials on slaves , and a pewter plate marked Hussar . None brought up gold . None of the early treasure seekers , it seems , could get down to the after part of the ship . They pulled off the cabin and upper works and got a few guineas and relics from her gun deck , but never got to her hold , never anywhere near her lowest hold , where lay ? everybody supposed ? the kegged gold under her ballast . The wreck and treasure were still there by the time of our own Civil War , and treasure seekers still pecking away at her . With two sets of them the Treasury entered into contracts ( the first which granted that only a small percentage of the treasure need come to the sovereign ) but got not a thing . As late as 1900 came again proof of location : salvagers of a yacht brought up a big anchor marked H.M.S. Hussar . But no treasure . And in the ensuing years all tries continued to fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene : a man who owned the specifications of 7,000 treasure ships all over the world , a famed inventor , a genuine scientist . This was Simon Lake , the inventor who played a major part in the development of the submarine . Lake asked for and got from the Treasury Department an exclusive contract to retrieve the treasure aboard the Hussar . It provided that only ten per cent and any old guns found would go to the Department . The contract began to operate in March 1933 , at a time when Lake was nearly seventy . However , he had the temperament of a natural-born treasure hunter : eternal optimism , the patience of Job , and the persistence of the worker ant ? as subsequent events were to reveal . Further , Lake had a new and remarkable device for underwater treasure hunting which no other seeker had ever used . This was his Submarine Salvager . It enabled a treasure hunter , normally dressed , to walk down a slanting tube which was pivotally attached to a surface ship , reach the Submarine Salvager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( behind which air pressure kept the water out ) , step through , and walk along the East River in his rubber boots ? while the Submarine Salvager , with underwater light filtering in through its portholes , cruised along just a few inches above the bottom . If he ran into any treasure he ought to know it , since down there in the Salvager he could see well enough to read . Always methodical , Lake took until September 1936 to determine from all the evidence where the Hussar must lie . A memo in the files declares : " Lake now states he has definitely charted the area where the Hussar must be . " A few days later he was triumphantly writing , " I believe I have located the Hussar ? in silt off 135th Street . The hulk I have found lies in 72 feet of water at the stern , which is the depth in the old records . " Previously he had discovered that the 1778 soundings for the main bed of the river and today 's were the same . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer of tar , residue of a gas-making plant which had once stood near by , that the hull was intact below the gun deck , and that the silt over her was 12 feet deep . He noted about this time , too , that his contract with the Treasury Department ranout this very month , asked for extension , and received it for a year . Then he set to work to pump off the silt . In February we find him writing the Department of progress and difficulties . The ferries and the scows unloading scrap for Japan forced him to move constantly , to give them way . The lower silt was hard . He was having to break it with a hydraulic jet . " But I am firmly convinced , " he says , " that the hulk is the Hussar . I am now preparing a core drill . If we bring up chalk we will be pretty sure we have got the ship . " On the prospects , the Treasury Department promptly extended his contract again , for a year . UT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast Guard head in the New York area , Rear Admiral R. R. Waesche , reported that Lake 's salvage efforts had been discontinued . The Treasury wrote the submarine inventor , asking , in essence , " What about it ? " and warning that any further contract extension would depend on " your showing substantial progress toward success . " Lake replied that he had completed a hundred drillings and found , alas , only silt ? from the 134th Street Ferry Slip to within fifty feet of the 136th Street Pier . " I am satisfied , " he said , " that the Hussar is not there . " But , he added , because of scrap barges he had been unable to search near the pier . There he had sounded 72 feet of water , the right depth , and it was possible that the Hussar lay in that space . He had now narrowed down the possible search area to the size of a square 170 feet on a side . He would like to search there when the dock was free . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties raised their ugly head . Lake had been putting all he had into the search ( in the immemorial way of treasure hunters ) and now had sunk several hundred thousand dollars . Therefore , when his contract with the Treasury was extended yet again , in September 1937 , he found himself without funds for renewal of the contract bond . There were some dark days while his attorneys pleaded with the government to permit him to file only when actual work was renewed , which would be soon . The Treasury both believed in and liked him ( that is evident in the record ) and said , finally , OK . Within a month Lake was writing in about a new lead to the Hussar 's location . It had come ? as so often in treasure hunting ? in a rather bizarre way . An old Bronx resident named Henry Ploger had come to him and claimed that as a boy he had been taken out to fish on the Hussar ( then partly above water ) by his grandfather , and that he could put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1,000 , 000 ! Lake investigated Ploger and found he belonged to a family which had once owned much land near 134th Street . But $1,000,000 was $1,000,000 . " I can put you on the spot ? find it the first day , " Ploger wrote again , and kept coming around and talking to the Salvager 's crew . Finally he offered to tell the Hussar 's location for five per cent of the treasure found . Lake had a contract drawn ; Ploger signed , and led him out to a spot a little east of 149th Street , where the Submarine Salvager 's probe and rock drill brought up wood on the very first sounding . But then no more . Meanwhile , the files show , the indefatigable Lake was carrying on constant historical investigation of the Hussar while pushing the actual search work . He looked into the career of Captain Charles Pratt of Worcester , who had worked on the hulk before 1850 , and reported , " I learn he began to buy property in 1851 and became a wealthy man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the treasure from the Hussar ? But the daughter of Pratt 's partner assured Lake that Captain Pratt had never found the treasure . " I would like , " Lake goes on , " to retain the right of searching further . " Soon after , he announced good fortune . He had now received from the British Admiralty Office a copy of the Hussar builder 's plans . From these he was convinced that much of the treasure ship was still intact , even though former searchers ( in 1872 ) may have tried to blast her . He had now found a way to do his work so that it would n't interfere with surface craft , and had developed an inspection caisson which did away with the need forpumping off the silt . The contract should be extended ( it was ) for another year . One year later ? August 1939 ? Lake had probed 1,800 feet of the Bronx shore front 50 feet off the 136th Street dock down to hard rock thousands of times . He had pumped up rivet heads , grate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver coins post-1900 . He was now convinced that the Hussar lay further off shore and had an agent checking this in old records in England . He was positive that her position had been shifted by a salvage attempt of 1818 which had lifted her stern with chains from which she slid off and over the shore ledge on to the bottom of the East River 's main stream . " I have found a lot of wreckage there , " he advised , " and there I can work without traffic trouble . " Based on his " present belief that it is there the treasure lies , " he asked for yet one more extension of his contract . This time Washington was reluctant . The Treasury now doubted his ability to find the wreck , wrote that it might be a " hopeless undertaking . " But the little man with the shock of snow white hair and the fiery gleam of all treasure trove seekers forever in his eyes argued that he had " improved the Submarine Salvager , so it can make a quick survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was firm . " We will give consideration to making a new contract next spring or summer provided you are ready to resume and complete operations at that time . " The operations were not renewed because , of course , the war came . T IIENT among the Simon Lake-Hussar papers you will come upon this : a news clipping , russet with age , and in the minuscule type of the Washington Post of 1905 , in which a reader begs to cite from the Boston Evening Gazette of 1823 a copy of a letter from Sir Charles Pole , the commander of the Hussar . Writing on January 24 , 1812 , Sir Charles declares : It was the Hussar which struck on Pot Rock when I commanded her in 1780. 1 am not aware that there was any treasure on board her or anything but stores belonging to her as a 28-gun ship . . ? This may perhaps serve to prevent disappointment for future seekers of treasure trove . So Simon Lake and all those other seekers after the Hussar gold were chasing something that never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can this be possible ? But wait . Prowl on a little further in the files . Dated thirty-eight days after the Treasury Department closed the book on treasure hunter Lake there is this , from a man in Michigan : Over a three year period I have been directing a confidential move here Detroit which we hope will result in the salvage operation of the Hussar . Through the courtesy of His Majesty George VI , the Secretary and Lords Commissioners of the British Admiralty have been kind enough to furnish me blueprints of the ship , the court-martial record , Admiral Arbuthnot 's report of the loss to the Commissioners , a copy of the Hussar 's complement of 200 men , and Treasury information that the sum of ? 137,622 , 15 s. 8 d. was aboard when she left Dover with instructions to pick up ? 10,000 at Plymouth on her way to North America .
