Cautious Mike McDermott , U.S. press chief in Moscow , and a Roman Catholic , wondered if it was proper for the conference to meet on Good Friday . George Marshall wrote on McDermott 's note : " The struggle for peace is appropriate on any day . " But work on the German treaty was so hopelessly deadlocked that the Friday meeting had to be canceled anyway . <P> A Little Progress . Last week the Ministers managed to agree that central administrative agencies should be established in Germany , and , three months later , a German Advisory Council which the U.S. hopes will take over as a provisional government . But disagreement remained on everything else , including the composition of the council . The Russians wanted it to include the Organization of Free German Women , the Farmers ' Aid Society , and the Culture Bund-all Communist fronts . Replied Ernie Bevin : " We should consult well-known groups , rather than these others . As a very old propagandist of the Socialist Party , I know a lot about . . . why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nothing I agree to politically for Germany can go into effect until a workable settlement has been reached economically . " That was the rub . Marshall offered a slight concession to the Russians ' demand for reparations from German current production ; he declared that the U.S. would " study " the demand on condition : 1 ) that the Soviets would agree to leave in Germany certain factories originally slated to be removed to Russia and take their reparations only from these factories ; 2 ) that current production reparations must not increase occupation costs , or retard German self-support . Under these terms , Russia , which needs its reparations now , might not begin to receive payments for five years . <P> A Big Laugh . There were other matters to preoccupy the delegates . Correspondents reported the sudden popularity of the " Champagne Cobbler " ( jigger syrup , jigger lemon extract , 1 jigger curaao , 1 jigger cognac , 1 chunk of pineapple , add champagne to taste , serve chilled . Price : $6.60 ) . Even Molotov showed signs of gaiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Aero Club , he took special interest in a Russian animated cartoon involving the capers of three big bears . He was observed in convulsions of laughter and clutching his paunch when the biggest bear managed to outwit ths whole menagerie.
