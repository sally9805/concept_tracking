The Japs ' balloon-bombing campaign against the U.S. had always looked fantastic , but not until last week was it clear how much effort had been expended on it . The Army &; Navy , after digging through enemy archives , summarized their findings . <P> After the Doolittle bombing of Tokyo , the Japs decided that they had to retaliate somehow . They spent years , and $18,000,000 , researching and manufacturing long-range gas bags , mostly of mulberry-bark paper . Some 9.000 were launched . Only 283 are known to have landed in the Eastern Pacific or North America . No military damage was done . A few grass fires were started and six people were killed-when an Oregon child tampered with an unexploded bomb .
