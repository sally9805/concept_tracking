For a fortnight , U.S. Methodists have been studying the state of the world and the dangers it holds for religion . Behind closed doors in a Manhattan hotel , 36 bishops of the Methodist Church spent three days trying to analyze the strengths and weaknesses , the failures and successes of Communism . Last week , at Buck Hill Falls , Pa. , Methodists assembled for the tenth annual meeting of their Board of Missions and Church Extension . Some of what they heard was cheering : Chinese Communists were treating missionaries better than had been expected and the church in the U.S. was growing fast enough to put up a new church building every day . <P> But New York 's Bishop G. Bromley Oxnam , allowing the Methodists no chance to feel too complacent , told them that two important threats are facing the church : Communism and Roman Catholicism . <P> " I regret to record these matters , " Bishop Oxnam said . " But ... we confront a crisis , now worldwide , in which freedom itself is at stake . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we understand it . The Communist Party does not believe in civil liberty as we understand it . When either the Roman Catholic Church or the Communist Party , acting upon its belief in these matters , seeks to deny to us either religious or civil liberty , our own freedom is involved , and it is not a part of tolerance to submit to such denials until at last our freedom passes . . . <P> " In this connection , the current issue involving the use of public funds for the support of parochial education ... is part of a carefully calculated plan to break down the American doctrine of the separation of church and state . . . " <P> <P> In Boston , Roman Catholic Archbishop Richard J. Gushing also saw a menace-in Protestants and Other Americans United for Separation of Church and State , an organization which Bishop Oxnam helped found two years ago ( TIME , Jan. 19 , 1948 ) . <P> Such groups , Archbishop Gushing told the Archdiocesan Union of Holy Name Societies , were a " refined form of the Ku @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by slogans about separation of church and state , and similar " glittering generalities , " he said : " Our people are in a very precarious position thanks to the extremely hard , though evil work , which contemporary anti-Catholics have done . . . The damage they are accomplishing in creating prejudice on the one hand and uneasiness on the other is very considerable indeed . "
