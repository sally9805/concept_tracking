John Steelman , sometimes dubbed " Assistant President , " is the man who keeps things from piling up when the boss is away . Recently , moon-faced John Steelman found himself at the bottom of a pile . <P> His boss , Harry Truman , was a little disappointed by the way the Vinson business had turned out ( TIME , Oct. 18 ) , and had decided to try something else . So White House advisers , including the President 's military aide , Major General Harry Vaughan , cooked up another idea to spring at a strategic moment in the political campaign . <P> This one was to be an executive order . It would bristle with " whereases . " It would be written in language which could not fail to convince everyone that Mr. Truman , while a candidate for reelection , nevertheless was still Mr. Johnny-on-the-job . High officials who later had it quoted to them ( few ever actually got to see it ) remembered such phrases as " unfriendly country " and " mobilization to meet an attack . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document continued , the Defense Department was ordered to organize the nation 's reserves and report progress within 60 days . <P> " My God , Jim . " The President , well pleased , went off on his political trip to the Midwest , leaving Assistant President Steelman to bring the document to flower and deliver it to Defense Secretary James <P> Forrestal . The document was placed before Forrestal one noontime while he was having lunch with his three service secretaries and the Joint Chiefs of Staff . <P> Most of the men around the table were flabbergasted and appalled . Secretary of the Army Kenneth Royall went back to his office , called Forrestal four hours later and gasped : " My God , Jim , do you know what that means ? That is virtually a declaration of war . " <P> Forrestal had already acted . The story around the Pentagon was that he telephoned Steelman and told him that the wording of the order was unthinkable . He sent the document to Major General Harold Bull , deputy director of G3 , with instructions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order which could be issued without scaring the wits out of the whole nation , if not the world . When General Bull finished his draft it was forwarded to Harry Truman on his campaign train . <P> Family Secret . It was this draft which the President issued . Even though it was toned down , the proclamation still created some stir . The President felt obliged to reassure the country that all was well ; and that the outlook for peace , he thought , was even improving . <P> Actually , stripped of its more startling " whereases , " the order was a rehash of some of the recommendations made last summer by Assistant Secretary of the Army Gordon Gray with the idea of strengthening the nation 's debilitated reserves . The Truman order called for little more than : 1 ) better reserve training programs , 2 ) more facilities for Army and Air Force Reserve Corps and the National Guard .
