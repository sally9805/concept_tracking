Man 's feet are more distinctively human than his apelike hands . But he does n't pay much attention to his feet , and he does n't think very highly of foot doctors . Podiatry ( a newer and more popular word than chiropody ) is not yet recognized as a part of organized medicine. * <P> One of the men largely responsible for podiatry 's increasingly respectable status is Manhattan 's Dr. Maurice J. Lewi ( rhymes with Dewey ) . Dr. Lewi , who celebrated his birthday last week by blowing out all 91 candles ( none to grow on ) with one lusty puff , has been thinking about foot troubles for 72 years . <P> Father 's Pain . His interest began with a pain in his father 's foot . His father , a doctor , suffered from metatarsalgia ( a pain between instep and toes ) . His medical colleagues did him no good , but an oldtime chiropodist helped him . Said Lewi 's father : " Maurice , someday it may be your opportunity to let the doctors know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Maurice was a medical student . <P> While he was secretary of the New York State Board of Medical Examiners , a job he held for 22 years , Dr. Lewi , in 1895 , backed the first law in New York giving chiropodists the right to set standards of fitness . For almost 36 years he has been president of Long Island University 's College of Podiatry . <P> Podiatrists may now give local ( but not general ) anesthetics , prescribe sedatives like barbiturates ( not narcotics ) , perform minor surgery . They treat not only corns , bunions and calluses , but also foot symptoms of gout , arthritis and circulation disturbances . One of their most important jobs is teaching diabetics proper foot care , to reduce the chances of gangrene . Podiatrists practice in 40 hospitals in New York State , in about 1,000 in the U.S. <P> Chauffeur 's Callus . Modern man 's feet , says Dr. Lewi , get too little exercise but are overworked in other ways .

He has never had any trouble with his feet , except for a corn back in 1913 . <P> Dr. Lewi has a pet explanation for his energetic longevity : " I have never lost any energy resisting temptation ... I have been a bit selfish all my life . " He likes a Scotch highball before dinner , a glass of wine or beer before bed , and smokes 12 to 14 cigars a day . He plays both poker and bridge , often until 1 a.m. , but he almost never wins , he explains , because he is a Pechvogel ( unlucky person ) . His dream for the future is a hospital for foot sufferers . Says he : " It 's funny . There are so many wealthy , gouty old men . None of them has yet set aside money for a real podiatry hospital .
