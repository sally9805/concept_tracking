txt China observes today the eighth anniversary of her war with Japan . She could consider it a fourteenth anniversary , for she has had no real peace since 1931 , when the Japanese took Manchuria . Since July 7 , 1937 , she has been under direct attack , with enemy troops occupying her largest cities , holding most of her railway lines and much of her richest soil , and shutting her off almost completely from the sea . She lists 3,178,000 military casualties , including 1,310,000 dead . Her civilian casualties , caused by direct enemy action , by famine and by war-born diseases , are beyond computation . It has been a war as fantastic as it was horrible . The occupation map is veritably a Chinese puzzle , with its great corridor stretching from north to south , its conquered strips along railways , rivers and highways , its islands of resistance behind the enemy lines . The China of the ports , centers of industry and trade has passed to the Japanese . A new China , governmental , educational and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It lacks railways and raw materials , but these same lacks have made it difficult for the Japanese to smash it . A puppet Government sits precariously in Nanking . Some Chinese have been disloyal . The larger picture is of a nation of 450,000,000 , people , not closely united before the war , not administratively closely united now , torn by dissensions which the one-party system can not conceal , but overwhelmingly united in hate and scorn of the would-be conqueror . American readers have not found it easy to follow what took place in China after the Japanese made their first sweeping conquests . Advances and retreats , " bread-basket " raids , claims and counter-claims have been confusing . Only a few general lines of strategy have been clear . Last year the Japanese seemed to be making a determined effort to stabilize their corridor all the way from Peiping through Hankow to Canton and perhaps to IndoChina . They had some success , and drove the American fliers out of their advance air bases . This year the Japanese are pulling in their horns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north , possibly to concentrate dwindling forces in a few important areas . The American advance in the Pacific and the increasing Russian pressure in the north have had something to do with this new policy . The Chinese by themselves could not drive the Japanese out of any strong point they meant to hold . But it is cruelly unjust to minimize what the Chinese have done for the common cause , or to overlook the terrible disadvantages under which they have fought . Let us ask ourselves what the situation would have been if Chiang Kai-shek had made peace . The wealth of China would then have been completely under Japanese control . Japanese troops now scattered over communications lines and in garrison towns could have been concentrated against us . The Japanese dead , estimated by Chungking at nearly 2,000 , - 000 and certainly a large number , would be alive and taking their toll of American boys . Victory is now inevitable . When it comes we will owe a great debt to the Chinese who fought while Britain and the United States were still trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
