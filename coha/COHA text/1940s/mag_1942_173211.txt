The public was only given to understand that somehow the regular Department of Agriculture appropriation had got hung up in Congress , but something far bigger than that was going on . At stake was the success of the nation 's entire wartime food program , not to mention the possibility of entirely unnecessary and artificial inflation of food prices . At stake for a relatively few top-drawer U.S. farmers were several hundred million dollars of velvet . <P> Four men had accomplished a gigantic legislative squeeze . Lobbyists Earl Smith of Illinois and Ed O'Neal of Alabama and Congressmen Clarence Cannon of Missouri and Everett Dirksen of Illinois now had the Administration , the Congress and some five million farm operators in a tight vise . <P> In a decade of lobbying and fighting for power , the two Farm Bureau chiefs and the two Congressmen had never been sitting quite so pretty as they were last week . By preventing the passage of the farm bill , they had tied up the Administration 's basic wartime food plan . <P> The plan is simple and logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that it needs . With 260 million surplus bushels of wheat already in the Government 's hands ( and many million more unwanted bushels soon to be harvested ) , the Government planned to sell a fraction ( 125 million bushels ) of its hoard for use as fodder , at 83 a bushel . As fodder , the unneeded grain would be converted into much-needed meat and eggs . More than that , by releasing some of the stored wheat , grain prices would be kept from rising to artificial heights . <P> Prodded by Franklin Roosevelt , the Senate approved the request for authority to sell the surplus wheat . Not so the House , mindful of elections and the Corn Belt vote . <P> Goaded by Illinois ' Dirksen and Missouri 's Cannon , the House flatly refused to let any of the Government wheat be sold for less than an arbitrary sliding-scale price that would work out at about $1.34 . So that Franklin Roosevelt could not veto this provision , the farm bloc tied it to the Agriculture Department 's appropriation bill . <P> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its interests . Part of that $680-million bill is a request for $222.8 million for Farm Security Administration , the farsighted , big-hearted New Deal agency that keeps small farmers and marginal farmers on their feet-the farmers who by comparison get the skim milk after the top-drawer farmers have taken the cream . FSA can help 500,000-odd small-time farmers produce much-needed foodstuffs . But the Farm Bureau and their Congressmen hate FSA with a real and poisonous hatred ; FSA helps impoverished Negroes and whites to own their own 40 acres and a mule , to gain independence , to pay their poll taxes , to assert their rights as individuals .
