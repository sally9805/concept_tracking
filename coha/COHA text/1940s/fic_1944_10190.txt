puffed at his pipe and Suzanne waited for him to go on . " We used to wangle it so that we could get our leave together , and when we went to Paris he went wild . We had a grand time . We were due for a spot of leave early in March , in ' eighteen that was , and we made our plans beforehand . There was n't a thing we were n't going to do . The day before we were to go we were sent up to fly over the enemy lines and bring back reports of what we saw . Suddenly we came bang up against some German planes , and before we knew where we were we were in the middle of a dogfight . One of them came after me , but I got in first . I took a look to sec if he was going to crash and then out of the corner of my eye I saw another plane on my tail . I dived to get away from him , but he was on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ; then I saw Patsy come down on him like a streak of lightning and give him all he 'd got . They 'd had enough and sheered off and we made for home . My machine had got pretty well knocked about and I only just made it . Patsy got in before me . When I got out of my plane they 'd just got him out of his . He was lying on the ground and they were waiting for the ambulance to come up . When he saw me he grinned . " I got that blighter who was on your tail , ' he said . " What 's the matter , Patsy ? ' I asked . " Oh , it 's nothing . He winged me . ' " He was looking deathly white . Suddenly a strange look came over his face . It had just come to him that he was dying , and the possibility of death had never so much as crossed his mind . Before they could stop him he sat up and gave a laugh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He fell back dead . He was twenty-two . He was going to marry a girl in Ireland after the war . " wept and men too , I had a feeling that perhaps those men who lay under the little crosses were better off than we who lived . I told a friend what I felt and he asked me what I meant . I could n't explain and I saw that he thought me a perfect damned fool . And I remember after a battle seeing a pile of dead French soldiers heaped upon one another . They looked like the marionettes in a bankrupt puppet show that had been cast pell-mell into a dusty corner because they were of no use any more . I thought then just what Larry said to you : the dead look so awfully dead . " I do not want the reader to think I am making a mystery of whatever it was that happened to Larry during the war that so profoundly affected him , a mystery that I shall disclose at a convenient moment . I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years later tell a woman , SuzanneRouvier , whom Larry and I both knew , about the young airman who had met his death saving his life . She repeated it to me and so I can only relate it at second hand . I have translated it from her French . Larry had apparently struck up a great friendship with another boy in his squadron . Suzanne knew him only by the ironical nickname by which Larry spoke of him . " He was a little chap with red hair , an Irishman . We used to call him Patsy , ' Larry said , " and he had more vitality than anyone I 've ever known . Gosh , he was a live wire . He had a funny face and a funny grin , so that it made you laugh just to look at him . He was a harum-scarum devil and he 'd do the craziest things ; he was always getting hell from the higher-ups . He was absolutely without fear and when he 'd escaped death by a hair 's breadth he 'd grin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke in the world . But he was a natural-born flyer and up in the air he was cool and wary . He taught me a lot . He was a bit older than me and he took me under his wing ; it was rather comic really , because I was a good six inches taller than he was and if it had come to a scrap I could have knocked him out cold . Once in Paris when he was drunk and I was afraid he was going to get into trouble I did . " I felt a bit out of it when I joined the squadron and I was afraid I would n't make good , and he just joshed me into having confidence in myself . He was funny about the war , he had no feeling of hatred for the Jerries ; he loved a scrap and to fight them tickled him to death . He simply could n't look upon bringing down one of their planes as anything but a practical joke . He was impudent and wild and irresponsible , but there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liking him . He 'd give you his last penny as freely as he 'd take yours . And if you were lonely or homesick or scared , and I was sometimes , he 'd see it and with his ugly little face puckered up with laughter he 'd say just the right thing to make you feel all right again . " The day after my talk with Isabel I left Chicago for San Francisco , where I was to take ship for the Far East . CHAPTER TWO ( i ) 1 DID NOT SEE Elliott till he came to London towards the end of June of the following year . I asked him whether Larry had after all gone to Paris . He had . I was faintly amused at Elliott 's exasperation with him . " I had a kind of sneaking sympathy for the boy . I could n't blame him for wanting to spend a couple of years in Paris and I was prepared to launch him . I told him to let me know the moment he arrived , but it was only when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he 'd come . I wrote to him care of the American Express , which was the address she gave me , and asked him to come and dine to meet some of the people I thought he ought to know ; I thought I 'd try him out first with the FrancoAmericanset , Emily de Montadour and Gracie de Chateau-Gaillard and so on , and d' you know what he answered ? He said he was sorry he could n't come , but he had n't brought any evening clothes with him . " Elliott looked me full in the face to see the stupefaction with which he expected this communication to fill me . He raised a supercilious eyebrow when he observed that I took it with calm . " He replied to my letter on a sheet of nasty paper with the heading of a cafe in the Latin Quarter and when I wrote back I asked him to let me know where he was staying . I felt I must do something about him for Isabel 's sake , and I thought perhaps he was shy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow in his senses could come to Paris without evening clothes , and in any case there are tolerable tailors there , so I asked him to lunch and said it would be quite a small party , and would you believe it , not only did he ignore my request to give me solve other address than the American Express , but he said he never ate luncheon . That finished himas far as I was concerned . " " I wonder what he 's been doing with himself . " " I do n't know , and to tell you the truth I do n't care . I 'm afraid he 's a thoroughly undesirable young man and I think it would be a great mistake for Isabel to marry him . After all , if he led a normal sort of life I d have run across him at the Ritz har or at Fouquet 's or somewhere . " I go sometimes to these fashionable places myself , but I go to others also , and it happened that I spent several days in Paris early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where I was proposing to take one of the Messagerie ships for Singapore . I dined one evening with friends in Montparnasseand after dinner we went to the Dome to drink a glass of beer . Presently my wandering eye caught sight of Larry sitting by himself at a little marble-topped table on the crowded terrace . He was looking idly at the people who strolled up and down enjoying the coolness of the night after a sultry day . I left my party and went up to him . His face lit up when he saw me and he gave me an engaging smile . Ide asked me fo sit down , but I said I could n't as I was with a party . " I just wanted to say how d' you do to you , " I said . " Are you staying here ? " he asked . " Only for a very few days . " 42 " Will you lunch with me tomorrow P " " I thought you never lunched . " He chuckled . " You 've seen Elliott . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I just have a glass of milk and a brioche , but I 'd like you to lunch with me . " " All right . " We arranged to meet at the Dome next day to have an aperitif and eat at some place on the boulevard . I rejoined my friends . We sat on talking . When next I looked for Larry he had gone. ( ii ) I spent the next morning very pleasantly . I went to the Luxembourg and passed an hour looking at some pictures I liked . Then I strolled in the gardens , recapturing the memories of my youth . Nothing had changed . They might have been the same students who walked along the gravel paths in pairs , eagerly discussing the writers who excited them . They might have been the same children who trundled the same hoops under the watchful eyes of the same nurses . They might have been the same old men who basked in the sunshine reading the morning paper . They might have been the same middle-aged women in mourning who sat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food and the misdeeds of servants . Then I went to the Odeon and looked at the new books in the galleries and I saw the lads who like myself thirty years before were trying under the petulant eyes of the smock-frocked attendants to read as much as they could of books they could not afford to buy . Then I strolled leisurely along those dear , dingy streets till I came to the Boulevarddu Montparnasse and so to the Dome . Larry was waiting . We had a drink and walked along to a restaurant where we could lunch in the open air . He was perhaps a little paler than I remembered him and this made his very dark eyes , in their deep orbits , more striking ; but he had the same self-possession , curious in one so young , and the same ingenuous smile . When he ordered his lunch I noticed that he spoke French fluently and with a good accent . I congratulated him on it . " I knew a certain amount of French before , you know , " he explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when they were at Marvin she used to make us talk French with her all the time . " I asked him how he liked Paris . " Very much . " " D' you live in Montparnasse ? " 43 " Yes , " he said , after a moment 's hesitation which I interpreted into a disinclinationto tell exactly where he lived . " Elliott was rather put out that the only address you gave was the American Express . " Larry smiled but did not answer . " What do you do with yourself all the time ? " " I loaf . " And you read ? " " Yes , I read . " " Do you ever hear from Isabel ? " " Sometimes . We 're neither of us great letter writers . She 's having a grand time in Chicago . They 're coming over next year to stay with Elliott . " " That 'll be nice for you . " " I do n't believe Isabel 's ever been to Paris . It 'll be fun taking her around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in China and listened attentivelyto what I told him ; but when I tried to get him to talk about himself , I failed . He was so uncommunicative that I was forced to the conclusion that he had asked me to lunch with him merely to enjoy my company . I was pleased , but baffled . We had no sooner finished our coffee than he called for the bill , paid it and got up . " Well , I must be off , " he said . We parted . I knew no more of what he was up to than before . I did not see him again. ( iii ) I was not in Paris in the spring when , sooner than they had planned , Mrs. Bradley and Isabel arrived to stay with Elliott ; and again I have to eke out my knowledge of what passed during the few weeks they spent there by the exercise of my imagination . They landed at Cherbourg and Elliott , alwaysconsiderate , went to meet them . They passed through the customs . The train started . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very good lady 's maid to look after them and when Mrs. Bradley said that was quite unnecessary , since they did n't need one , he was very sharp with her . " Do n't be tiresome the moment you arrive , Louisa . No one can be well turned out without a maid , and I 've engaged Antoinette not only for your sake and Isabel 's , but for mine . It would mortify me that you should n't be perfectly dressed . " He gave the clothes they were wearing a disparaging glance . " Of course you 'll want to buy some new frocks . On mature consideration I 've come to the conclusion that you ca n't do better than Chanel . " " I always used to go to Worth , " said Mrs. Bradley. 44She might as well not have spoken , for he took no notice . " I 've talked to Chanel myself and I 've made an appointment for you tomorrow at three . Then there are hats . Obviously Reboux . " " I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know . I am proposing to pay for everything myself . I 'm determined that you shall be a credit to me . Oh , and Louisa , I 've arranged several parties for you and I 've told my French friends that Myron was an ambassador , which , of course , he would have been if he 'd lived a little longer , and it makes a better effect . I do n't suppose it 'll come up , but I thought I 'd better warn you . " " You 're ridiculous , Elliott . " " No , I 'm not . I know the world . I know that the widow of an ambassadorhas more prestige than the widow of a minister . " As the train steamed into the Gare du Nord , Isabel , who was standing at the window , called out : " There 's Larry . " It had hardly stopped when she sprang out and ran to meet him . He threw his arms round her . " How did he know you were coming ? " Elliott asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship . " Mrs. Bradley kissed him affectionately , and Elliott gave him a limp hand to shake . It was ten o'clock at night . " Uncle Elliott , can Larry come to lunch tomorrow ? " cried Isabel , her arm in the young man 's , her face eager and her eyes shining . " I should be charmed , but Larry has given me to understand that he does n't eat lunch . " " He will tomorrow , wo n't you , Larry ? " " I will , " he smiled . " I shall look forward to seeing you at one o'clock then . " He stretched out his hand once more , intending to dismiss him , but Larry grinned at him impudently . " I 'll help with the luggage and get a cab for you . " " My car is waiting and my man will see to the luggage , " said Elliott with dignity . " That 's fine . Then all we 've got to do is to go . If there 's room for mt I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , do , Larry , " said Isabel . They walked down the platform together , followed by Mrs. Bradley and Elliott . Elliott 's face bore a look of frigid disapproval . " Quelles manieres , " he said to himself , for in certain circumstances he felt he could express his sentiments more forcibly in French . Next morning at eleven , having finished dressing , for he was not an45early riser , he sent a note to his sister , via his man Joseph and her maid Antoinette , to ask her to come to the library so that they could have a talk . When she appeared he closed the door carefully and , putting a cigarette into an immensely long agate holder , lit it and sat down . " Am I to understand that Isabel and Larry are still engaged ? " he asked . " So far as I know . " " I 'm afraid I have n't a very good account to give you of the young man . " He told her then how he had been prepared to launch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish him in a fit and proper manner . " I even had my eye on a rez-de-chaussee that would have been the very thing for him . It belongs to the young Marquis de Rethel and he wanted to subletit because he 'd been appointed to the embassy at Madrid . " But Larry had refused his invitations in a manner that made it quite clearthat he did not want his help . " What the object of coming to Paris is if you 're not going to take advantage of what Paris has to give you is beyond my comprehension . I do n't know what he does with himself . He does n't seem to know anybody . Doyou know where he lives ? " ' The only address we 've ever had is the American Express . " " Like a traveling salesman or a school teacher on vacation . I shouldn'tbe surprised if he was living with some little trollop in a studio in Mont-martre . " " Oh , Elliott . " " What other explanation can there be for the mystery he 's making of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own class ? " " It does n't sound like Larry . And last night , did n't you get the impression that he was just as much in love with Isabel as ever ? He could n't be sofalse . " Elliott by a shrug of the shoulders gave her to understand that there was no limit to the duplicity of men . " What about Gray Maturin ? Is he still in the picture ? " " He 'd marry Isabel tomorrow if she 'd have him . " Mrs. Bradley told him then why they had come to Europe sooner thanthey had at first intended . She had found herself in ill-health , and the doctors had informed her that she was suffering from diabetes . It was not serious and by attention to her diet and taking moderate doses of insulin there was no reason why she should not live for a good many years , but the knowledge that she had an incurable disease made her anxious to see Isabel settled . They had talked the matter over . Isabel was sensible . She had agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the twoyears in Paris they had agreed upon and get a job , there was only one thing to do and that was to break with him . But it offended Mrs. Bradley 's senseof personal dignity that they should wait till the appointed time and then come to fetch him , like a fugitive from justice , back to his own country . She felt that Isabel would put herself in a humiliating position . But it was very natural that they should spend the summer in Europe , which Isabel had not been to since she was a child . After their visit in Paris they could go to some watering place suitable to Mrs. Bradley 's complaint , then on to the Austrian Tyrol for a while and from there travel slowly through Italy . Mrs. Bradley 's intention was to ask Larry to accompany them , so that he and Isabel could see whether the long separation had left their feelings unchanged . It would be manifest in due course whether Larry , having had his fling , was prepared to accept the responsibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for turning down the position he offered him , but Gray has talked him round , and he can go into the businessthe moment he comes back to Chicago . " " Gray 's a very nice fellow . " " He certainly is . " Mrs. Bradley sighed . " I know he 'd make Isabel happy . " Elliott then told her what parties he had arranged for them . He was giving a big luncheon on the following day and at the end of the week a grand dinner party . He was taking them to a reception at the ChateauGaillardsand he had got cards for them to a ball that the Rothschilds were giving . " You 'll ask Larry , wo n't you ? " " He tells me he has n't any evening clothes , " Elliott sniffed . " Well , ask him all the same . After all , he is a nice boy , and it would n't help to give him the cold shoulder . It would only make Isabel obstinate . " " Of course I 'll ask him if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appointed time , and Elliott , whose manners were admirable , was pointedly cordial to him . It was not difficult , since Larry was so gay , in such high spirits that it would have needed a much more ill-natured man than Elliott not to be charmed with him . The conversationdealt with Chicago and their common friends there , so that there was not much for Elliott to do other than to look amiable and pretend to be interested in the concerns of persons whom he thought of no social consequence . He did not mind listening ; indeed , he thought it rather touching o hear them tell of this young couple 's engagement , that young couple 's marriage , and another young couple 's divorce . Who had ever heard of them ? He knew that that pretty little Marquise de Clinchant had tried to poison herself because her lover , the Prince de Colombey , had left her to marry the daughter of a South American millionaire . That was something to talk about . Looking at Larry , he was obliged to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his deep-set , strangely black yes , his high cheekbones , pale skin and mobile mouth he reminded47Elliott of a portrait by Botticelli , and it occurred to him that if he were dressed in the costume of the period he would look extravagantly romantic . He remembered his notion of getting him off with a distinguished French woman and he smiled slyly on reflecting that he was expecting at dinner on Saturday Marie Louise de Florimond , who combined irreproachable connectionswith notorious immorality . She was forty , but looked ten years younger ; she had the delicate beauty of her ancestress painted by Nattier which , owing to Elliott himself , now hung in one of the great American collections ; and her sexual voracity was insatiable . Elliott decided to put Larry next to her . He knew she would waste no time in making her desires clear to him . He had already invited a young attache at the British Embassy whom he thought Isabel might like . Isabel was very pretty , and as he was an Englishman , and well off , it would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent Montrachet with which they had started lunch and by the fine Bordeaux that followed , Elliott thought with tranquil pleasure of the possibilities that presented themselves to his mind . If things turned out as he thought they very well might , dear Louisa would have no more cause for anxiety . She had always slightly disapproved of him ; poor dear , she was very provincial ; but he was fond of her . It would be a satisfaction to him to arrange everything for her by help of his knowledge of the world . To waste no time , Elliott had arranged to take his ladies to look at clothes immediately after lunch , so as they got up from table he intimated to Larry with the tact of which he was a master that he must make himself scarce , but at the same time he asked him with pressing affability to come to the two grand parties he had arranged . He need hardly have taken so much trouble , since Larry accepted both invitations with alacrity . But Elliott 's plan failed . He was relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presentable dinner jacket , for he had been a little nervous that he would wear the same blue suit that he had worn at lunch ; and after dinner , getting Marie Louise de Florimond into a corner , he asked her how she had liked his young American friend . " He has nice eyes and good teeth . " " Is that all ? I put him beside you because I thought he was just your cup of tea . " She looked at him suspiciously . " He told me he was engaged to your pretty niece . " " Voyons , ma there , the fact that a man belongs to another woman has never prevented you from taking him away from her if you could . " " Is that what you want me to do ? Well , I 'm not going to do your dirt . w ork for you , my poor Elliott . " Elliott chuckled . " The meaning of that , I presume , is that you tried your stuff and found there was nothing doing . " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morals of a bawdy-house keeper . You do n't want him to marry your niece . Why not ? He is well bred and quite charming . But he 's really too innocent . I do n't think he had the least suspicion of what I meant . " " You should have been more explicit , dear friend . " " I have enough experience to know when I 'm wasting my time . The fact is that he has eyes only for your little Isabel , and between you and me , she has twenty years advantage over me . And she 's sweet . " " Do you like her dress ? I chose it for her myself . " " It 's pretty and it 's suitable . But of course she has no chic . " Elliott took this as a reflection on himself , and he was not prepared to let Madame de Florimond get away without a dig . He smiled genially . " One has to have reached your ripe maturity to have your chic , dear friend , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapier . Her retort made Elliott 's Virginian blood boil . " But I 'm sure that in your fair land of gangsters vOtre beau pays d'apaches they will hardly miss something that is so subtle and so in-imitable . " But if Madame de Florimond carped , the rest of Elliott 's friends were delighted both with Isabel and with Larry . They liked her fresh prettiness , her abounding health and her vitality ; they liked his picturesque appearance , his good manners and his quiet , ironic humour . Both had the advantage of speaking good and fluent French . Mrs. Bradley , after living so many years in diplomatic circles , spoke it correctly enough but with an unabashed American accent . Elliott entertained them lavishly . Isabel , pleased with her new clothes and her new hats , amused by all the gaiety Elliott provided and happy to be with Larry , thought she had never enjoyedherself so much. ( iv ) Elliott was of opinion that breakfast was a meal that you should share only with total strangers , and then only if there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her will , and Isabel , far from displeased , were obliged to have theirs in their bedrooms . But Isabel , when she awoke , sometimes told Antoinette , the grand maid Elliott had engaged for them , to take her cafe au laic into her mother 's room so that she could talk to her while she had it . In the busy life she led it was the only moment of the day in which she could be alone with her . One such morning , when they had been in Paris nearly a month , after Isabel had done narrating the40events of the previous night , most of which she and Larry had spent going the round of the night clubs with a party of friends , Mrs. Bradley let fall the question she had had in mind to ask ever since their arrival . " When is he coming back to Chicago ? " " I do n't know . He has n't spoken of it . " " Have n't you asked him ? " " No . " " Are you scared to ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bradley , lying on a chaise longue , in a modish dressing-gown that Elliott had insisted on giving her , was polishing her nails . " What do you talk about all the time when you 're alone ? " " We do n't talk all the time . It 's nice to be together . You know , Larry was always rather silent . When we talk I think I do most of the talking . " " What has he been doing with himself ? " " I do n't really know . I do n't think anything very much . I suppose he 's been having a good time . " " And where is he living ? " " I do n't know that either . " " He seems very reticent , does n't he ? " Isabel lit a cigarette and , as she blew a cloud of smoke from her nostrils , looked coolly at her mother . " What exactly do you - mean by that , Mamma ? " " Your uncle Elliott thinks he has an apartment and is living there with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't believe that , do you ? " " No , I honestly do n't . " Mrs. Bradley looked reflectively at her nails , " Do n't you ever talk to him about Chicago ? " " Yes , a lot . " " Has n't he given any sort of indication that he intends to come back ? " " I ca n't say he has . " " He will have been gone two years next October . " " I know . " " Well , it 's your business , dear , and you must do what you think right . But things do n't get any easier by putting them off . " She glanced at her daughter , but Isabel would not meet her eyes . Mrs. Bradley gave her an affectionate smile . " If you do n't want to be late for lunch you 'd better go and have your bath . " " I 'm lunching with Larry . We 're going to some place in the Latin Quar ter . " " Enjoy yourself . " An hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cab to the Pont Sta Michel and sauntered up the crowded boulevard till they came to a cafe they liked the look of . They sat down on the terrace and ordered a couple of Dubonnets . Then they took another cab and went to a restaurant . Isabel had a healthy appetite and she enjoyed the good things Larry ordered for her . She enjoyed looking at the people sitting cheek by jowl with them , for the place was packed , and it made her laugh to see the intense pleasure they so obviously took in their food ; but she enjoyed above all sitting at a tiny table alone with Larry . She loved the amusement in his eyes while she chattered away gaily . It was enchanting to feel so much at home with him . But at the back of her mind was a vague disquiet , for though he seemed very much at home too , she felt it was not so much with her as with the surroundings . She had been faintly disturbed by what her mother had said , and though seeming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was not quite the same as when he had left Chicago , but she could n't tell in what the difference lay . He looked exactly as she rememberedhim , as young , as frank , but his expression was changed . It was not that he was more serious , his face in repose had always been serious , it had a calmness that was new to her ; it was as though he had settled something , with himself and were at ease in a way he had never been before . When they had finished lunch he suggested that they should take a stroll ' through the Luxembourg . " No , I do n't want to go and look at pictures . " " All right then , let 's go and sit in the gardens . " " No , I do n't want to do that either . I want to go and see where you live . " " There 's nothing to see . I live in a scrubby little room in a hotel . " " Uncle Elliott says you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's model . " " Come on then and see for yourself , " he laughed . " It 's only a step from here . We can walk . " He took her through narrow , tortuous streets , dingy notwithstanding the streak of blue sky that showed between the high houses , and after a while stopped at a small hotel with a pretentious facade . " Here we are . " Isabel followed him into a narrow hall , on one side of which was a desk and behind it a man in shirt sleeves , with a waistcoat in thin black and yellow stripes and a dirty apron , reading a paper . Larry asked for his key , and the man handed it to him from the rack immediately behind him . He gave Isabel an inquisitive glance that turned into a knowing smirk . It was clear that he thought she was going to Larry 's room for no honest purpose . They climbed up two flights of stairs , on which was a threadbare red carpet , and Larry unlocked his door . Isabel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the gray apartment house opposite , on the ground floor of which was a stationer 's shop . There was a single bed in the room , with a night table beside it , a heavy wardrobe with a large mirror , an upholstered but straight-backed armchair and a table between the windows on which were a typewriter , papers and a number of books . The chimney piece was piled with paper-bound volumes . " You sit in the armchair . It 's not very comfortable , but it 's the best I can offer . " He drew up another chair and sat down . " Is this where you live ? " asked Isabel . He chuckled at the look on her face . " It is . I 've been here ever since I came to Paris . " " But why ? " " It 's convenient . It 's near the Bibliotheque Nationale and the Sorbonne . " He pointed to a door she had not noticed . " It 's got a bathroom . I can get breakfast here and I generally dine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's awfully sordid . " " Oh no , it 's all right . It 's all I want . " " But what sort of people live here ?

It 's a very quiet and respectable place . " Isabel was a trifle disconcerted and because she knew Larry noticed it and was amused she was half inclined to take offence . " What 's that great big book on the table ? " she asked . " That ? Oh , that 's my Greek dictionary . " " Your what ? " she cried . " It 's all right . It wo n't bite you . " " Are you learning Greek ? " " Yes . " " Why ?  --  " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her with a smile in his eyes and she smiled back at him . " Do n't you think you might tell me what you 've been up to all the time you 've been in Paris ? " " I 've been reading a good deal . Eight or ten hours a day . I 've attended lectures at the Sorbonne . I think I 've read everything that 's important in French literature and I can read Latin , at least Latin prose , almost as fluentlyas I can read French . Of course Greek 's more difficult . But I have avery good teacher . Until you came here I used to go to him three evenings a week . " " And what is that going to lead to ? " " The acquisition of knowledge , " he smiled . " It does n't sound very practical . " " Perhaps it is n't and on the other hand perhaps it is . But it 's enormous fun .

" He got up from his chair , as though impelled by an excitement that seized him , and walked up and down the small room . " I 've been reading Spinoza the last month or two . I do n't suppose I understandvery much of it yet , but it fills me with exultation . It 's like landing from your plane on a great plateau in the mountains . Solitude , and an air so pure that it goes to your head like wine and you feel like a million dol-lars . " " When are you coming hack to Chicago ? " " Chicago ? I do n't know . I have n't thought of it . " " You said that if you had n't got what you wanted after two years you 'd give it up as a bad job . " " I could n't go back now . I 'm on the threshold . I see vast lands of the spirit stretching out before me , beckoning , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you expect to find in them ? " " The answers to my questions . " He gave her a glance that was almost playful , so that except that she knew him so well , she might have thought he was speaking in jest . " I want to make up my mind whether God is or God is not . I want to find out why evil exists . I want to know whether I have an immortal soul or whether when I die it is the end . " Isabel gave a little gasp . It made her uncomfortable to hear Larry say such things , and she was thankful that he spoke so lightly , in the tone of ordinary conversation , that it was possible for her to overcome her embarrassment . " But Larry , " she smiled , " people have been asking those questions for thousands of years . If they could be answered , surely they 'd have been answered by now . " Larry chuckled . " Do n't laugh as if I 'd said something idiotic , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've said something shrewd . But on the other hand you might say that if men have been asking them for thousands of years it proves that they ca n't help asking them and have to go on asking them . Besides , it 's not true that no one has found the answers . There are52 53more answers than questions , and lots of people have found answers that were perfectly satisfactory for them . Old Ruysbroek for instance . " " Who was he ? " " Oh , just a guy I did n't know at college , " Larry answered flippantly . Isabel did n't know what he meant , but passed on . " It all sounds so adolescent to me . Those are the sort of things sophomoresget excited about and then when they leave college they forget about them . They have to earn a living . " " I do n't blame them . You see , I 'm in the happy position that I have enough to live on . If I had n't I 'd have had to do like everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money mean anything to you ? " " Not a thing , " he grinned . " How long d' you think all this is going to take you ? " " I would n't know . Five years . Ten years . " " And after that ? What are you going to do with all this wisdom ? " " If I ever acquire wisdom I suppose I shall be wise enough to know what to do with it . " Isabel clasped her hands passionately and leant forwards in her chair . " You 're so wrong , Larry . You 're an American . Your place is n't here . Your place is in America . " " I shall come back when I 'm ready . " " But you 're missing so much . How can you bear to sit here in a backwaterjust when we 're living through the most wonderful adventure the world has ever known ? Europe 's finished . We 're the greatest , the most powerful people in the world . We 're going forwards by leaps and bounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take part in the development of your country . You 've forgotten , you do n't know how thrilling life is in America today . Are you sure you 're not doing this because you have n't the courage to stand up to the work that 's before every American now ? Oh , I know you 're working in a way , but is n't it just an escape from your responsibilities ? Is it more than just a sort of laborious idleness ? What would happen to America if everyone shirked as you 're shirking ? " " You 're very severe , honey , " he smiled , " The answer to that is that everyonedoes n't feel like me . Fortunately for themselves , perhaps , most people are prepared to follow the normal course ; what you forget is that I want to learn as passionately as  --  Gray , for instance , wants to make pots of money .

Am I of no importance to you at all ? " " You 're of very great importance . I want you to marry me . " " When ? In ten years ? " " No . Now . As soon as possible . " " On what ? Mamma ca n't afford to give me anything . Besides , she would n't if she could . She 'd think it wrong to help you to live without doing anything . " " I would n't want to take anything from your mother , " said Larry . " I 've got three thousand a year . That 's plenty in Paris . We could have a little apartment and a bonne a tout faire . We 'd have such a lark , darling . " " But , Larry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Of course one can . Lots of people live on much less . " " But I do n't want to live on three thousand a year . There 's no reason why I should . " " I 've been living on half that . " " But how ! " She looked at the dingy little room with a shudder of distaste . " It means I 've got a bit saved up . We could go down to Capri for our honeymoon and then in the fall we 'd go to Greece . I 'm crazy to go there . Do n't you remember how we used to talk about travelling all over the world together ? " " Of course I want to travel . But not like that . I do n't want to travel second-class on steamships and put up at third-rate hotels , without a bathroom , and eat at cheap restaurants .

Violet Tomlinson had one last year and she did it as cheaply as she could and it cost her twelve hundred and fifty . And what d' you think a nurse costs ? " She grew more vehement as one idea after another occurred to her . " You 're so impractical . You do n't know what you 're asking me to do . I 'm young , I want to have fun . I want to do all the things that people do . I want to go to parties , I want to go to dances , I want to play golf and ride horseback . I want to wear nice clothes . Ca n't you imagine what it means to a girl not to be as well dressed as the rest of her crowd ? D' you know what it means , Larry , to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and being thankful when someone out of pity makes you a present of a new one ? I could n't even afford to go to a decent hairdresser to have my hair properly done . I do n't want to go about in street-cars and omnibuses ; I want to have my own car . And what d' you suppose I 'd find to do with55myself all day long while you were reading at the Library ? Walk about the streets window-shopping or sit in the Luxembourg Gardens seeing that my children did n't get into mischief ? We would n't have any friends . " " Oh , Isabel , " he interrupted . " Not the sort of friends I 'm used to . Oh yes , Uncle Elliott 's friends would ask us now and then for his sake , but we could n't go because I would n't have the clothes to go in , and we would n't go because we could n't afford to return their hospitality . I do n't want to know a lot of scrubby , unwashed people ; I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing , to say to me . I want to lie , Larry . " She grew suddenly conscious of the look in his eyes , tender as it always was when fixed on her , but gently amused . " You think I 'm silly , do n't you ? You think I 'm being trivial and horrid . " " No , I do n't . I think what you say is very natural . " He was standing with his back to the fireplace , and she got up and went up to him so that they were face to face . " Larry , if you had n't a cent to your name and got a job that brought you in three thousand a year I 'd marry you without a minute 's hesitation . I 'd cook for you , I 'd make the beds , I would n't care what I wore , I 'd go without anything , I 'd look upon it as wonderful fun , because I 'd know that it was only a question of time and you 'd make good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our lives with nothing to look forward to . It means that I should be a drudge to the day of my death . And for what ? So that you can spend years trying to find answers to questions that you say yourself are insoluble . It 's so wrong . A man ought to work . That 's what he 's here for . That 's how he contributes to the welfare of the community . " " In short it 's his duty to settle down in Chicago and enter Henry Maturin'sbusiness . Do you think that by getting my friends to buy the securities that Henry Maturin is interested in I should add greatly to the welfare of the community ? " " There must be brokers and it 's a perfectly decent and honorable way ofearning a living . " " You 've drawn a very black picture of life in Paris on a moderate income . You know , it is n't really like that . One can dress very nicely without going to Chanel . And all the interesting people do n't live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foch . In fact few interesting people do , because interesting people generally do n't have a lot of money . I know quite a number of people here , painters and writers and students , French , English , American , and what not , whom I think you 'd find much more amusing than Elliott 's seedy marquises and long-nosed duchesses . You 've got a quick mind and a lively sense of humour . You 'd enjoy hearing them swap ideas across the dinner table even though the wine was only vinordinaire and you did n't have a butler and a couple of footmen to wait on you . " " Do n't be stupid , Larry . Of course I would . You know I 'm not a snob . I 'd love to meet interesting people . " " Yes , in a Chanel dress . D' you think they would n't catch on to it that you looked upon it as a sort of cultured slumming ?

" Isabel slightly shrugged her shoulders . " I daresay you 're right . They 're not the sort of people I 've been brought up with . They 're not the sort of people I have anything in common with . " " Where does that leave us ? " " Just where we started . I 've lived in Chicago ever since I can remember . All my friends are there . All my interests are there . I 'm at home there . It 's where I belong and it 's where you belong . Mamma 's ill and she 's never going to get any better . I could n't leave her even if I wanted to . " " Does that mean that unless I 'm prepared to come back to Chicago you do n't want to marry me ? " Isabel hesitated . She loved Larry . She wanted to marry him . She wanted him with all the power of her senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe that when it came to a showdown he would n't weaken . She was afraid , but she had to risk it . " Yes , Larry , that 's just what it does mean . " He struck a match on the chimney piece , one of those old-fashioned French sulphur matches that fill your nostrils with an acrid odour , and lit his pipe . Then , passing her , he went over and stood by one of the windows . He looked out . He was silent for what seemed an endless time . She stood as she had stood before , when she was facing him , and looked in the mirrorover the chimney piece , but she did not see herself . Her heart was beatingmadly and she was sick with apprehension . He turned at last . " I wish I could make you see how much fuller the life I offer you is than anything you have a conception of . I wish I could make you see how excitingthe life of the spirit is and how rich in experience . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's only one thing like it , when you 're up in a plane by yourself , high , high , and only infinity surrounds you . You 're intoxicated by the boundless space . You feel such a sense of exhilaration that you would n't exchange it for all the power and glory of the world . I was reading Descartes the other day . The ease , the grace , the lucidity . Gosh ! " " But Larry , " she interrupted him desperately , " do n't you see you 're askingsomething of me that I 'm not fitted for , that I 'm not interested in anddo n't want to be interested in ? How often have I got to repeat to you that I 'm just an ordinary , normal girl , I 'm twenty , in ten years I shall be old , I want to have a good time while I have the chance . Oh , Larry , I do love you so terribly . All this is just trifling . It 's not going to lead you anywhere . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Be a man , Larry , and da a man 's work . You 're just wasting the precious years that others are doing so much with . Larry , if you love me you wo n't give me up for a dream . You 've had your fling . Come back with us to America . " " I ca n't , darling . It would be death to me . It would be the betrayal of my soul . " " Oh , Larry , why d' you talk in that way ? That 's the way hysterical highbrowwomen talk . What does it mean ? Nothing . Nothing . Nothing . " " It happens to mean exactly what I feel , " he answered , his eyes twinkling . " How can you laugh ? Do n't you realize this is desperately serious ? We 've come to the crossroads and what we do now is going to affect our whole lives . " " I know that . Believe me , I 'm perfectly serious . " She sighed . " If you wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But I do n't think it 's reason . I think you 've been talking the most terriblenonsense all the time . " " I ? " If she had n't been so miserable she would have laughed . " My poor Larry , you 're as crazy as a coot . " She slowly slipped her engagement ring off her finger . She placed it on the palm of her hand and looked at it . It was a square-cut ruby set in a thin platinum band and she had always liked it . " If you loved me you would n't make me so unhappy . " " I do love you . Unfortunately sometimes one ca n't do what one thinks is ' right without making someone else unhappy . " She stretched out her hand on which the ruby was resting and forced a smile to her trembling lips . " Here you are , Larry . " " It 's no good to me . Wo n't you keep it as a memento to our friendship ? You can wear it on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " " I shall always care for you , Larry . " " Then keep it . I should like you to . " She hesitated for an instant , then put it on the finger of her right hand . " It 's too large . " " You can have it altered . Let 's go to the Ritz bar and have a drink . " " All right . " She was a trifle taken aback that it had all gone so easily . She had not pried . Nothing seemed to be changed except that now she was n't going to58marry Larry . She could hardly believe that everything was over and done with . She resented the fact a little that they had n't had a terrific scene . They had talked it all over almost as coolly as though they had been discussingthe taking of a house . She felt let down , but at the same time was conscious of a slight sense of satisfaction because they had behaved in such a civilized way . She would have given a lot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always difficult to know that ; his smooth face , his dark eyes were a mask that she was aware even she , who had known him for so many years , could not penetrate . She had taken off her hat and laid it on the bed . Now , standing before the mirror , she put it on again . " Just as a matter of interest , " she said , arranging her hair , " did you want to break our engagement ? " " No . " " I thought it might be a relief to you . " He made no reply . She turnee round with a gay smile on her lips . " Now I 'm ready . " Larry locked the door behind him . When he handed the key to the man at the desk he enveloped them both in a look of conniving archness . It was impossible for Isabel not to guess what he thought they had been up to . " I do n't believe that old fellow would bet much on my virginity , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drink . They spoke of indifferent things , without apparent constraint , like two old friends who saw one anotherevery day . Though Larry was naturally silent , Isabel was a talkative girl , with an ample fund of chit-chat , and she was determined that no silence should fall between them that might be hard to break . She was n't going to let Larry think she felt any resentment towards him and her pride constrained her to act so that he should not suspect that she was hurt and unhappy . Presently she suggested that he should drive her home . When he dropped her at the door she said to him gaily , " Do n't forget that you 're lunching with us tomorrow . " " You bet your life I wo n't . " She gave him her cheek to kiss and passed through the parte cochere. ( v ) When Isabel entered the drawing-room she found that some people had dropped in to tea . There were two American women who lived in Paris , exquisitely gowned , with strings of pearls round their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their fingers . Though the hair of one was darkly hennaed and that of the other unnaturally golden they were strangely alike . They had the same heavily mascaraed eyelashes , the same brightly painted lips , the same rouged cheeks , the same slim figures , 59 maintained at the cost of extreme mortification , the same clear , sharp fea- tures , the same hungry restless eyes ; and you could not but be conscious that their lives were a desperate struggle to maintain their fading charms . They talked with inanity in a loud , metallic voice without a moment 's pause , as though afraid that if they were silent for an instant the machine would run down and the artificial construction which was all they were would fall to pieces . There was also a secretary from the American Em- bassy , suave , silent , for he could not get a word in , and very much the man of the world , and a small dark Rumanian prince , all bows and servility , with little darting black eyes and a clean-shaven swarthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teacup , pass a plate of cakes , or light a cigarette and who shamelessly dished out to those present the most flattering , the most gross compliments . He was paying for all the dinners he had received from the objects of his adulation and for all the dinners he hoped to receive . Mrs. Bradley , seated at the tea table and dressed to please Elliott some- what more grandly than she thought suitable to the occasion , performed her duties as hostess with her usual civil but rather indifferent composure . What she thought of her brother 's guests I can only imagine . I never knew her more than slightly and she was a woman who kept herself to herself . She was not a stupid woman ; in all the years she had lived in foreign capital tals she had met innumerable people of all kinds and I think she summed them up shrewdly enough according to the standards of the small Viz.- ginian town where she was born and bred . I think she got a certain amount of amusement from observing their antics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graces any more seriously than she took the aches and pains of the characters in a novel which she knew from the beginning ( other- wise she would n't have read it ) would end happily . Paris , Rome , Peking had had no more effect on her Americanism than Elliott 's devout Catholi- cism on her robust , but not inconvenient , Presbyterian faith . Isabel , with her youth , her strapping good looks and her vitality brought a breath of fresh air into that meretricious atmosphere . She swept in like a young earth goddess . The Rumanian prince leapt to his feet to draw forward a chair for her and with ample gesticulation did his shift . The two American ladies , with shrill amiabilities on their lips , looked her up and down , took in the details of her dress and perhaps in their hearts felt a pang of dismay at being thus confronted with her exuberant youth . The American diplomat smiled to himself as he saw how false and haggard she made them look . But Isabel thought they were grand ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a twinge of envy for their sophisti- cated poise . She wondered if she would ever achieve that supreme ele- gance . Of course the little Rumanian was quite ridiculous , but he was rather sweet and even if he did n't mean the charming things he said it was nice to listen to them . The conversation which her entrance had interrupted was resumed and they talked so brightly , with so much conviction that what they were saying was worth saying , that you almost thought they were talking sense . They talked of the parties they had been to and the parties they were going to . They gossiped about the latest scandal . They tore their friends to pieces . They bandied great names from one to the other . They seemed to know everybody . They were in on all the secrets . Almost in a breath they touched upon the latest play , the latest dressmaker , the latest portrait painter , and the latest mistress of the latest premier . One would have thought there was nothing they did n't know . Isabel listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This really was life . It gave her a thrilling sense of being in the midst of things . This was real . The setting was perfect . That spacious room with the Savonneriecarpet on the floor , the lovely drawings on the richly panelled walls , the petit-point chairs on which they sat , the priceless pieces of marquetry , commodes and occasional tables , every piece worthy to go into a museum ; it must have cost a fortune , that room , but it was worth it . Its beauty , its discretion struck her as never before because she had still so vividly in her mind the shabby little hotel room , with its iron bed and that hard , comfortlesschair in which she had sat , that room that Larry saw nothing wrong in . It was bare , cheerless and horrid . It made her shudder to remember it . The party broke up and Isabel was left with her mother and Elliott . " Charming women , " said Elliott when he came back from seeing the two poor painted drabs to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris . I never dreamt they 'd turn out as well as they have . It 's amazing , the adaptability of our women . You 'd hardly know they were Americans now and Middle West into the bargain . " Mrs. Bradley , raising her eyebrows , without speaking gave him a look which he was too quick-witted not to understand . " No one could ever say that of you , my poor Louisa , " he continued half acidly and half affectionately . " Though heaven knows , you 've had every chance . " Mrs. Bradley pursed her lips . " I 'm afraid I 've been a sad disappointment to you , Elliott , but to tell you the truth I 'm very satisfied with myself as I am . " " Tous les gouts sont dans la nature , " Elliott murmured . " I think I ought to tell you that I 'm no longer engaged to Larry , " said Isabel . " Tut , " cried Elliott . " That 'll put my luncheon table out for tomorrow . How on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short notice ? " " Oh , he 's coming to lunch all right . " 66o " After you 've broken off your engagement ? That sounds very unconven-tional . " Isabel giggled . She kept her gaze on Elliott , for she knew her mother 's eyes were fixed upon her and she did n't want to meet them . " We have n't quarrelled . We talked it over this afternoon and came to the conclusion we 'd made a mistake . He does n't want to come back to America ; he wants to stop on in Paris . He 's talking of going to Greece . " " What on earth for ? There 's no society in Athens . As a matter of fact I never thought so much of Greek art myself . Some of that Hellenistic stuff has a certain decadent charm that 's rather attractive . But Phidias : no , no . " " Look at me , Isabel , " said Mrs. Bradley . Isabel turned and with a faint smile on her lips faced her mother . Mrs. Bradley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , " H 'm . " The girl had n't been crying , that she saw ; she looked calm and composed . " I think you 're well out of it , Isabel , " said Elliott . " I was prepared to make the best of it , but I never thought it a good match . He was n't really up to your mark , and the way he 's been behaving in Paris is a pretty clear indication that he 'll never amount to anything . With your looks and your connections you can aspire to something better than that . I think you 've behavedin a very sensible manner . " Mrs. Bradley gave her daughter a glance that was not devoid of anxiety . " You have n't done this on my account , Isabel ? " Isabel shook her head decidedly . " No , darling , I 've done it entirely on my own . " ( vi ) I had come back from the East and was spending some time in London just then . It was perhaps a fortnight after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up one morning . I was not surprised to hear his voice , for I knew that he was in the habit of coming to England to enjoy the fag end of the season . He told me that Mrs. Bradley and Isabel were with him and if I would drop in that evening at six for a drink they would be glad to see me . They were , of course , staying at Claridge 's . I was at that time living not far from there , so I strolled down Park Lane and through the quiet , dignified streets of Mayfair till I came to the hotel . Elliott had his usual suite . It was panelled in brown wood like the wood of a cigar box and furnished with quiet sumptuousness . He was alone when I was ushered in . Mrs. Bradley and Isabel had gone shopping and he was expecting them at any minute . He told me that Isabel had broken her engagement to Larry . Elliott with his romantic and highly conventional sense of how people6zshould comport themselves under given circumstances had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry come to lunch the very day after the break , but he had acted as though his position were unchanged . He was as pleasant , attentive and soberly gay as usual . He treated Isabel with the same comradely affectionateness with which he had always treated her . He seemed neither harassed , upset nor woebegone . Nor did Isabel appear dispirited . She looked as happy , she laughed as lightly , she jested as merrily as though she had not just taken a decisive and surely searing step in her life . Elliott could not make head or tail of it . From such scraps of their conversation as he caught he gathered that they had no intention of breaking any of the dates they had made . On the first opportunity he talked it over with his sister . " It 's not decent , " he said . " They ca n't run around together as if they were still engaged . Larry really should have more sense of propriety . Besides , it damages Isabel 's chances . Young Fotheringham , that boy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's got money and he 's very well connected ; if he knew the coast was clear I would n't be at all surprised if he made her an offer . I think you ought to talk to her about it . " " My dear , Isabel 's twenty and she has a technique for telling you to mind your own business without offensiveness which I 've always found very difficult to cope with . " " Then you 've brought her up extremely badly , Louisa . And besides , it is your business . " " That is a point on which you and she would certainly differ . " " You 're trying my patience , Louisa . " " My poor Elliott , if you 'd ever had a grown-up daughter you 'd know that by comparison a bucking steer is easy to manage . And as to knowing what goes on inside her  --  well , it 's much better to pretend you 're the simple , innocent old fool she almost certainly takes you for . " " But you have talked the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She laughed at me and told me there was really nothing to tell . " " Is she cut up ? " " I would n't know . All I do know is that she eats well and sleeps like a child . " " Well , take my word for it , if you let them go on like this they 'll go off one of these days and get married without saying a word to anybody . " Mrs. Bradley permitted herself to smile . " It must be a relief to you to think that at present we 're living in a countrywhere every facility is afforded to sexual irregularity and every obstacle put in the way of marriage . " " And quite rightly . Marriage is a serious matter on which rest the se6 ; curity of the family and the stamlity of the state . But marriage can onl ' , maintain its authority if extraconjugal relations are not only tolerated but sanctioned . Prostitution , my poor Louisa  --  " " That 'll do , Elliott , " interrupted Mrs. Bradley . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral value of promiscuous fornication . " It was then he put forward a scheme that would interrupt Isabel 's continuedintercourse with Larry that was so repugnant to his sense of what was fitting . The Paris season was drawing to a close and all the best people were arranging to go to watering places or to Deauville before repairing for the rest of the summer to their ancestral chateaux in Touraine , Anjou or Brittany . Ordinarily Elliott went to London at the end of June , but his family feeling was strong and his affection for his sister and Isabel sincere ; he had been quite ready to sacrifice himself and remain in Paris , if they wished it , when no one who was anyone was there ; but he found himself now in the agreeable situation of being able to do what was best for others and at the same time what was convenient to himself . He proposed to Mrs. Bradley that the three of them should go to London immediately , where the season was still in full swing and where new interests and new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Accordingto the papers the great specialist on Mrs. Bradley 's disease was then in the British capital and the desirability of consulting him would reasonablyaccount for their precipitate departure and override any disinclinationto leave Paris that Isabel might have . Mrs. Bradley fell in with the plan . She was puzzled by Isabel . She could not make up her mind whether she was as carefree as she seemed or whether , hurt , angry or heartsick , she was putting on a bold front to conceal her wounded feelings . Mrs. Bradley could only agree with Elliott that it would do Isabel good to see new people and new places . Elliott got busy on the telephone and when Isabel , who had been spendingthe day at Versailles with Larry , came home , he was able to tell her that he had made an appointment for her mother to see the celebrated doctor three days from then , that he had engaged a suite at Claridge 's and that they were starting on the next day but one . Mrs. Bradley watched her daughter while this intelligence was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not turn a hair . " Oh , darling , I 'm so glad you 're going to see that doctor , " she cried with her usual rather breathless impetuosity . " Of course , you must n't miss the chance . And it 'll be grand going to London . How long are we going to stay ? " " It would be useless to come back to Paris , " said Elliott . " There wo n't be a soul here in a week . I want you to stay with me at Claridge 's for the rest of the season . There are always some good balls in July and of course64there 's Wimbledon . And then Goodwood and Cowes . I 'm sure the Ellinghamswill be glad to have us on their yacht for Cowes and the Bantocks always have a large party for Goodwood . " Isabel appeared to be delighted and Mrs. Bradley was reassured . It looked as though she were not giving Larry a thought . Elliott had just finished telling me all this when mother and daughter came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . Mrs. Bradleywas a little thinner than before and more pasty-faced ; she looked tired and none too well . But Isabel was blooming . With her high colour , the rich brown of her hair , her shining hazel eyes , her clear skin she gave an impression of such youth , of so much enjoyment of the mere fact of being alive that you felt half inclined to laugh with delight . She gave me the lather absurd notion of a pear , golden and luscious , perfectly ripe and simply asking to be eaten . She radiated warmth so that you thought that if you held out your hands you could feel its comfort . She looked taller than when I had last seen her , whether because she wore higher heels or because the clever dressmaker had cut her frock to conceal her youthful plumpness I do n't know , and she held herself with the graceful ease of a girl who has played outdoor games since childhood . She was in short sexuallya very attractive young woman . Had I been her mother I should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity to repay some of the kindness I had received from Mrs. Bradley in Chicago , I asked them all three to come to a play with me one evening . I arranged to give a luncheon for them . " You 'll be wise to get in at once , my dear fellow , " said Elliott . " I 've already let my friends know we 're here and I presume that in a day or two we shall be fixed up for the rest of the season . " I understood by this that Elliott meant that then they would have notime for the likes of me and I laughed . Elliott gave me a glance in which I discerned a certain hauteur . " But of course you 'll generally find us here about six o'clock and we shallalways be glad to see you , " he said graciously , but with the evident intention of putting me , as an author , in my humble place . But the worm sometimes turns . " You must try to get in touch with the St. Olpherds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispose of their Constable of Salisbury Cathedral . " " I 'm not buying any pictures just now . " " I know , but I thought you might dispose of it for them . " A steely glitter came into Elliott 's eyes . " My dear fellow , the English are a great people , but they have never beenable to paint and never will be able to paint . I am not interested in the English school . " 65(vii)During the next four weeks I saw little of Elliott and his relations . He did them proud . He took them for a week end to a grand house in Sussex and for another week end to an even grander one in Wiltshire . He took them to the royal box at the opera as guests of a minor princess of the House of Windsor . He took them to lunch and dine with the great . Isabel went to several balls . He entertained at Claridge 's a series of guests whose names made a fine show in the paper next day . He gave supper parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did all the right things and Isabel would have had to be much more sophisticated than she was not to have been a trifle dazzled by the splendour and elegance he provided for her delectation . Elliott could flatter himself that he was taking all this trouble from the purely unselfish motive of distracting Isabel 's mind from an unfortunatelove affair ; but I had a notion he got besides a good deal of satisfactionout of letting his sister see with her own eyes how familiar he was with the illustrious and fashionable . He was an admirable host and he took a delight in displaying his virtuosity . I went to one or two of his parties myself and now and again I dropped in at Claridge 's at six o'clock . I found Isabel surrounded by strapping young men in beautiful clothes who were in the Household Brigade or by elegant young men in less beautiful clothes from the Foreign Office . It was on one of these occasions that she drew me aside . " I want to ask you something , " she said . " D' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had an ice-cream soda ? " " Perfectly . " " You were very nice and helpful then . Will you be nice and helpful. again ? " " I 'll do my best . " " I want to talk to you about something . Could n't we lunch one day ? " " Almost any day you like . " " Somewhere quiet . " " What d' you say to driving down to Hampton Court and lunching ' , there ? The gardens should be at their best just now and you could seeQueen Elizabeth 's bed . " The notion suited her and we fixed a day . But when the day came the weather , which had been fine and warm , broke ; the sky was gray and a drizzling rain was falling . I called up and asked her if she would n't prefer to lunch in town . " We should n't be able to sit in the gardens and the pictures will be sodark , we sha n't see a thing . " 66 " I 've sat in lots of i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masters . Let 's go anyway . " " All right . " I fetched her and we drove down . I knew a small hotel where one ate tolerably and we went straight there . On the way Isabel talked with her usual vivacity of the parties she had been to and the people she had met . She had been enjoying herself , but her comments on the various acquaintancesshe had made suggested to me that she had shrewdness and a quick eye for the absurd . The bad weather had kept visitors away and we were the only occupants of the dining room . The hotel specialized in homely English fare and we had a cut off a leg of excellent lamb with green peas and new potatoes and a deep-dish apple pie with Devonshire cream to follow . With a tankard of pale ale it made an excellent lunch . When we had finished I suggested that we should go into the empty coffee room where there were armchairs in which we could sit in comfort . It was chilly in there , but the fire was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The flames made the dingy room more companionable . " That 's that , " I said . " Now tell me what you want to talk to me about . " " It 's the same as last time , " she chuckled . " Larry . " " So I guessed . " " You know that we 've broken off our engagement . " " Elliott told me . " " Mamma 's relieved and he 's delighted . " She hesitated for a moment and then embarked upon the account of her talk with Larry of which I have done my best faithfully to inform the reader . It may surprise the reader that she should have chosen to tell so much to someone whom she knew so little . I do n't suppose I had seen her a dozen times and , except for that one occasion at the drugstore , never alone . It did not surprise me . For one thing , as any writer will tell you , people do tell a writer things that they do n't tell others . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or two of his books they feel on peculiarly intimate terms with him ; or it may be that they dramatize themselves and , seeing themselves as it were characters in a novel , are ready to be as open with him as they imagine are to him the characters of his invention . And I think that Isabel felt that I liked Larry and her , and that their youth touched me , and that I was sympathetic to their distresses . She could not expect to find a friendly listener in Elliott who was disinclined to trouble himself with a young man who had spurned the best chance a young man ever had of getting into society . Nor could her mother help her . Mrs. Bradleyhad high principles and common sense . Her common sense assured her that if you wanted to get on in this world you must accept its conventions , and not to do what everybody else did clearly pointed to instability . Her67high principles led her to believe that a man 's duty v as to go to work in a business where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough money to keep his wife and family in accordance with the standards of his station , give his sons such an education as would enable them on reaching man 's estate to make an honest living , and on his death leave his widow adequately provided for . Isabel had a good memory and the various turns of the long discussion had engraved themselves upon it . I listened in silence till she had finished . She only interrupted herself once to ask me a question . " Who was Ruysdael ? " " Ruysdael ? He was a Dutch landscape painter . Why ? " She told me that Larry had mentioned him . He had said that Ruysdael at least had found an answer to the questions he was asking , and she repeatedto me his flippant reply when she had enquired who he was . " What d' you suppose he meant ? " I had an inspiration . " Are you sure he did n't say Ruysbroek ? " " He might have . Who was he ? " " He was a Flemish mystic who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said with disappointment . It meant nothing to her . But it meant something to me . That was the first indication I had of the turn Larry 's reflection was taking , and while she went on with her story , though still listening attentively , part of my mind busied itself with the possibilities that reference of his had suggested . I did not want to make too much of it , for it might be that he had only mentioned the name of the Ecstatic Teacher to make an argumentativepoint ; it might also have a significance that had escaped Isabel . When he answered her question by saying Ruysbroek was just a guy he had n't known in college he evidently meant to throw her off the scent . " What do you make of it all ? " she asked when she had come to an end . I paused before replying . " D' you remember his saying that he was just going to loaf ? If what he tells you is true his loafing seems to involve some very strenuous work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you see that if he 'd worked as hard at any productive form of work he 'd be earning a decent income ? " " There are people who are strangely constituted . There are criminals who 'll work like beavers to contrive schemes that land them in prison and they no sooner get out than they start all over again and again land in prison . If they put as much industry , as much cleverness , resource and patience into honest practices they could make a handsome living and occupy important positions . But they 're just made that way . They like crime . " 68 " Poor Larry , " she giggled . " You 're not going to suggest that he 's learningGreek to cook up a bank robbery . " I laughed too . " No , I 'm not . What I 'm trying to tell you is that there are men who are possessed by an urge so strong to do some particular thing that they ca n't help themselves , they 've got to do it . They 're prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people who love them ? " " Oh , yes . " " Is that anything more than plain selfishness ? " " I would n't know , " I smiled . " What can be the possible use of Larry 's learning dead languages ? " " Some people have a disinterested desire for knowledge . It 's not an ignobledesire . " " What 's the good of knowledge if you 're not going to do anything with it ? " " Perhaps he is . Perhaps it will be sufficient satisfaction merely to kno'v , as a sufficient satisfaction to an artist to produce a work of art . And perhaps it 's only a step towards something further . " " If he wanted knowledge why could n't he go to college when he came hack from the war ? It 's what Dr. Nelson and Mamma wanted him to do . " " I talked to him about that in Chicago . A degree would be of no use to him . I have an inkling that he had a definite idea of what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university . You know , in learning there 's the lone wolf as well as the wolf who runs in the pack . I think Larry is one of those persons who can go no other way than their own . " " I remember once asking him if he wanted to write . He laughed and said he had nothing to write about . " " That 's the most inconclusive reason for not writing that I 've ever heard , " I smiled . Isabel made a gesture of impatience . She was in no mood even for the mildest jest . " What I ca n't make out is why he should have turned out like this . Beforethe war he was just like everybody else . You would n't think it , but he plays a very good game of tennis and he 's quite a decent golfer . He used to do all the things the rest of us did . He was a perfectly normal boy and there was no reason to suppose he would n't become a perfectly normal man . After all you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain it . " " Who am I to explain the infinite complexities of human nature ? " " That 's why I wanted to talk to you today , " she added , taking no notice of what I said . " Are you unhappy ? " 69 " No , not exactly unhappy . When Larry is n't there I 'm all right ; it 's when I 'm with him that I feel so weak . Now it 's just a sort of ache , like the stiffnessyou get after a long ride when you have n't been on a horse for months ; it 's not pain , it 's not at all unbearable , but you 're conscious of it . I shall get over it all right . I hate the idea of Larry making such a mess of his life . " " Perhaps he wo n't . It 's a long , arduous road he 's starting to travel , but it may be that at the end of it he 'll find what he 's seeking . " " What 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems to me that in what he said to you he indicated it pretty plainly . God . " " God ! " she cried . But it was an exclamation of incredulous surprise . Our use of the same word , but in such a different sense , had a comic effect , so that we were obliged to laugh . But Isabel immediately grew serious again and I felt in her whole attitude something like fear . " What on earth makes you think that ? " " I 'm only guessing . But you asked me to tell you what I thought as a novelist . Unfortunately you do n't know what experience he had in the war that so profoundly moved him . I think it was some sudden shock for which he was unprepared . I suggest to you that whatever it was that happened to Larry filled him with a sense of the transiency of life and an anguish to be sure that there was a compensation for the sin and sorrow of the world . " I could see that Isabel did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her feel shy and awkward . " Is n't all that awfully morbid ? One has to take the world as it comes . If we 're here , it 's surely to make the most of life . " " You 're probably right . " " I do n't pretend to be anything but a perfectly normal , ordinary girl . I want to have fun . " " It looks as though there were complete incompatibility of temper between you . It 's much better that you should have found it out before mar-riage . " " I want to marry and have children and live " In that state of life in which a merciful Providence has been pleased toplace you , " I interrupted , smiling . " Well , there 's no harm in that , is there ? It 's a very pleasant state and I'mquite satisfied with it . " " You 're like two friends who want to take their holiday together , but one of them wants to climb Greenland 's snowy mountains while the other wants to fish off India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . " " Anyway I might get a sealskin coat off Greenland 's snowy mountains , and I think it 's very doubtful if there are any fish off India 's coral strand . " " That remains to be seen . " " Why d' you say that ? " she asked , frowning a little . " All the time you seem to be making some sort of mental reservation . Of course I know that I 'm not playing the star part in this . Larry 's got that . He 's the idealist , he 's the dreamer of a beautiful dream , and even if the dream does n't come true it 's rather thrilling to have dreamt it . I 'm cast for the hard , mercenary , practical part . Common sense is never very sympathetic , is it ? But what you forget is that it 's I who 'd have to pay . Larry would sweep along , trailingclouds of glory , and all there 'd be left for me would be to tag along and make both ends meet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget that at all . Years ago , when I was young , I knew a man who was a doctor , and not a bad one either , but he did n't practice . He spent years burrowing away in the library of the British Museum and at long intervals produced a huge pseudoscientific , pseudophilosophical book that nobody read and that he had to publish at his own expense . He wrote four or five of them before he died and they were absolutely worthless . He had a son who wanted to go into the army , but there was no money to send him to Sandhurst , so he had to enlist . He was killed in the war . He had a daughter too . She was very pretty and I was rather taken with her . She went on the stage , but she had no talent and she traipsed around the provinces playing small parts in second-rate companies at a miserable salary . His wife , after years of dreary , sordid drudgery broke down in health and the girl had to come home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer had the strength for . Wasted , thwarted lives and all to no purpose . It 's a toss-up when you decide to leave the beaten track . Many are called but few are chosen . " " Mother and Uncle Elliott approve of what I 've done . Do you approve too ? " " My dear , what can that matter to you ? I 'm almost a stranger to you . " " I look upon you as a disinterested observer , " she said , with a pleasant smile . " I should like to have your approval . You do think I 've done right , do n't you ? " " I think you 've done right for you , " I said , fairly confident that she would not catch the slight distinction I made in my reply . " Then why have I a bad conscience ? " " Have you ? " With a smile still on her lips , but a slightly rueful smile now , she nodded . " I know it 's only horse sense . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only possible thing . I know that from every practicalstandpoint , from the standpoint of worldly wisdom , from the standpaintof common decency , from the standpoint of what 's right and wrong , 7tI 've done what I ought to do . And yet at the bottom of my heart I 've got an uneasy feeling that if I were better , if I were more disinterested , more unselfish , nobler , I 'd marry Larry and lead his life . If I only loved him enough I 'd think the world well lost . " " You might put it the other way about . If he loved you enough he would n't have hesitated to do what you want . " " I 've said that to myself too . But it does n't help . I suppose it 's more in woman 's nature to sacrifice herself than in a man 's . " She chuckled . " Ruth and the alien corn and all that sort of thing . " " Why do n't you risk it ? " We had been talking quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation about people we both knew but in whose affairs we were not intimately concerned , and even when she narrated to me her talk with Larry Isabel had spoken with a sort of breezy gaiety , enlivening it with , humour , as if she did not want me to take what she said too seriously . But now she went pale . " I 'm afraid . " For a while we were silent . A chill went down my spine 4s it strangely does when I am confronted with deep and genuine human emotion . I find it terrible and rather awe-inspiring . " Do you love him very much ? " I asked at last . " I do n't know . I 'm impatient with him . I 'm exasperated with him . I keep longing for him . " Silence again fell upon us . I did n't know what to say . The coffee room in which we sat was small , and heavy lace curtains over the window shut out the light . On the walls , covered with yellow marbled paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shabby leather chairs and its musty smell it was strangely reminiscent of a coffee room in a Dickens novel . I poked the fire and put more coal on it . Isabel suddenly began to speak . " You see , I thought when it came to a showdown he 'd knuckle under . I knew he was weak . " " Weak ? " I cried . " What made you think that ? A man who for a year withstood the disapproval of all his friends and associates because he was determined to go his own way . " " I could always do anything I wanted with him . I could turn him round my little finger . He was never a leader in the things we did . He just tagged along with the crowd . " I had lit a cigarette and watched the smoke ring I had made . It grew larger and larger and then faded away into the air . " Mamma and Elliott thought it very wrong of me to go about with him afterwards as though nothing had happened , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on thinking up to the end that he 'd yield . I could n't believe that when he 'd got it into his thick head that I meant what I said he would n't give in . " She hesitated and gave me a smile of roguish , playful malice . " Will you be awfully shocked if I tell you something ? " " I think it very unlikely . " " When we decided to come to London I called Larry and asked him if we could n't spend my last evening in Paris together . When I told them , Uncle Elliott said it was most improper and Mamma said she thought it unnecessary . When Mamma says something is unnecessary it means she thoroughly disapproves . Uncle Elliott asked me what the idea was and I said we were going to dine somewhere and then make a tour of the night clubs . He told Mamma she ought to forbid me to go . Mamma said , Will you pay any attention if I forbid you to go ? " No , darling , ' I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what I imagined . In that case there does n't seem to be much point in my forbidding it . ' " " Your mother appears to be a woman of enormous sense . " " I do n't believe she misses much . When Larry called for me I went into her room to say good night to her . I 'd made up a bit ; you know , you have to in Paris or else you look so naked , and when she saw the dress I had on , I had an uneasy suspicion from the way she took me in from top to toe that she had a pretty shrewd idea what I was after . But she did n't say anything . She just kissed me and said she hoped I 'd have a good time . " " What were you after ? " Isabel looked at me doubtfully , as though she could n't quite decide how frank she was prepared to be . " I did n't think I was looking too bad and it was my last chance . Larry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely things to eat , all the things I particularly liked , and we had champagne . We talked our heads off , at least I did , and I made Larry laugh . One of the things I 've liked about him is that I can always amuse him . We danced . When we 'd had enough of that we went on to the Chateau de Madrid . We found some people we knew and joined them and we had more champagne . Then we all went to the Acacia . Larry dances quite well , and we fit . The heat and the music and the wine -- I was getting a bit lightheaded . I felt absolutely reckless . I danced with my face against Larry 's and I knew he wanted me . God knows , I wanted him . I had an idea . I suppose it had been at the back of my mind all the time . I thought I 'd get him to come home with me and once I 'd got him there , y ell , it was almost inevitable that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't put it more delicately . " " My room was quite a way from Uncle Elliott 's and Mamma 's and say I was going to have a baby . He 'd be obliged to come back and marry ' 72me , and when I 'd got him home I did n't believe it would be hard to keep him there , especially with Mamma ill . What a fool I am not to have thought of that before , ' I said to myself . Of course that 'll settle everything . ' When the music stopped I just stayed there in his arms . Then I said it was getting late and we had to take the train at noon , so we 'd better go . We got into a taxi . I nestled close to him and he put his arms around me and kissed me . He kissed me , he kissed me  --  oh , it was heaven . It hardly seemed a moment before the taxi stopped at the door . Larry paid it . " I shall walk home , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put my arms round his neck . " Wo n't you come up and have one last drink ? ' I said . t " Yes , if you like , ' he said . " He 'd rung the bell and the door swung open . He switched on the light , as we stepped in . I looked into his eyes . They were so trusting , so honest , so  --  so guileless ; he so obviously had n't the smallest idea that I was laying a trap for him ; I felt I could n't play him such a dirty trick . It was like taking candy off a child . D' you know what I did ? I said , Oh well , perhaps you 'd better not . Mamma 's not very well tonight and if she 's fallen asleep I do n't want to wake her up . Good night . ' I put my face up for him to kiss and pushed him out of the door . That was the end of that . " " Are you sorry ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just could n't help myself . It was n't me that did what I did . It was just an impulse that took possession of me and acted for me . " She grinned . " I suppose you 'd call it my better nature . " " I suppose you would . " " Then my better nature must take the consequences . I trust in the futur it 'll be more careful . " That was in effect the end of our talk . It may be that it was some consolationto Isabel to have been able to speak to someone with entire freedom , but that was all the good I had been able to do her . Feeling I had been inadequate , I tried to say at least some small thing that would give her comfort . " You know , when one 's in love , " I said , " and things go all wrong , one 's terribly unhappy and one thinks one wo n't ever get over it . But you 'll be astounded to learn what the sea will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . " Well , love is n't a good sailor and it languishes on a sea voyage . You 'll be surprised when you have the Atlantic between you and Larry to find how slight the pang is that before you sailed seemed intolerable . " " Do you speak from experience ? " " From the experience of a stormy past . When I suffered from the pangs of unrequited love I immediately got on an ocean liner . " The rain showed no sign of letting up , so we decided that Isabel could survive without seeing the noble pile of Hampton Court or even Queen 1:lizabeth 's bed and drove back to London . I saw her two or three times . alter that , but only when other people were present , and then , having had enough of London for a while , I set off for the Tyrol . CHAPTER THREE()FOR TEN YEARS AFTER THIS I saw neither Isabel nor Larry . I continued to see  --  liott and indeed , for a reason that I shall tell later , more frequently than before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was happening to Isabel . But of Larry he could tell me nothing . " For all I know he 's still living in Paris , but I 'm not likely to run across him . We do n't move in the same circles , " he added , not without colnI ) lacency . " It 's very sad that he should have gone so completely to seed . He comes of a very good family . I 'm sure I could have made something of him i1 he 'd put himself in my hands . Anyhow it was a lucky escape for Isabel . " My circle of'acquaintance was not so restricted as Elliott 's and I knew a number of persons in Paris whom he would have thought eminently undesirable . On my brief but not infrequent sojourns I asked one or other of them whether he had run across Larry or had news of him ; a few knew him casually , but none could claim any intimacy with him and I could find nobodyto give me news of him . I went to the restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been there for a long time , and they thought he must have gone away . I never saw him at any of the cafes on the Boulevard du Montparnasse which people who live in the neighborhood ire apt to go to . His intention , after Isabel left Paris , was to go to Greece , but this he . , handoned . What he actually did he told me himself many years later , but I will relate it now because it is more convenient to place events as far as I an in chronological order . He stayed on in Paris during the summer and ' orked without a break till autumn was well advanced . " I thought I needed a rest from books then , " he said , " I 'd been working rom eight to ten hours a day for two years . So I went to work in a coal wine . , " You did what ? " I cried . He laughed at my astonishment. i4 75 " I thought it would do me good to spend a few months in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me an opportunity to sort my thoughts and come to terms with myself . " I was silent . I wondered whether that was the only reason for this un- expected step or whether it was connected with Isabel 's refusal to marry ' him . The fact was , I did n't know at all how deeply he loved her . Most . people when they 're in love invent every kind of reason to persuade them- selves that it 's only sensible to do what they want . I suppose that 's why there are so many disastrous marriages . They are like those who put their affairs in the hands of someone they know to be a crook , but who happens to be an intimate friend because , unwilling to believe that a crook is a crook first and a friend afterwards , they are convinced that , however dishonest he may be with others , he wo n't be so with them . Larry was strong enough to refuse to sacrifice for Isabel 's sake the life that he thought was the life for him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to endure than he had ex- pected . It may be that like most of us he wanted to eat his cake and have it . " Well , go on , " I said . " I packed my books and my clothes in a couple of trunks and got the American Express to store them . Then I put an extra suit and some linen in a grip and started off . My Greek teacher had a sister who was married to the manager of a mine near Lens and he gave me a letter to him . D' you know Lens ? " " No . " " It 's in the North of France , not far from the Belgian border . I only spent a night there , at the station hotel , and next day I took a local to the place where the mine was . Ever been to a mining village ? " " In England . " " Well , I suppose it 's much the same . There 's the mine and the manager 's house , rows and rows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it 's so monotonous it makes your heart sink . There 's a newish , ugly church and several bars . It was bleak and cold when I got there and a thin rain was falling . I went to the manager 's office and sent in my letter . He was a little , fat man with red cheeks and the look of a guy who enjoys hi food . They were short of labour , a lot of miners had been killed in the war and there were a good many Poles working there , two or three hundred , I , should think . He asked me one or two questions , he did n't much like my being an American , he seemed to think it rather fishy , but his brother-in- law 's letter spoke well of me and anyhow he was glad to have me . He wanted to give me a job on the surface , but I told him I wanted to work down below . He said I 'd find it hard if I was n't used to it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so then he said I could be helper to a miner . That was boy 's work really , but there were n't enough boys to go round . He was 76 a nice fellow ; he asked me if I 'd done anything about finding a lodging , and when I told him I had n't , he wrote an address on a piece of paper and said that if I went there the woman of the house would let me have a bed . She was the widow of a miner who 'd been killed and her two sons were working in the mine . " I took up my grip and went on my way . I found the house , and the door was opened for me by a tall , gaunt woman with graying hair and big , dark eyes . She had good features and she must have been nice-looking once . She would n't have been bad then in a haggard way except for two missing front teeth . She told me she had n't a room , but there were two beds in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the other one . Her two sons had one of the upstairs rooms and she had the other . The room she showed me was on the ground floor and supposed , I imagined , to be the living-room ; I should have liked a room to myself , but I thought I 'd better not be fussy ; and the drizzle had turned into a steady , light rain and I was wet already . I did n't want to go further and get soaked to the skin . So I said that would suit me and I settled in . They used the kitchen as a living-room . It had a couple of rickety armchairs in it . There was a coal shed in the yard which was also the bathhouse . The two boys and the Pole had taken their lunch with them , hut she said I could eat with her at midday . I sat in the kitchen afterwards smoking and while she went on with her work she told me all about herself and her family . The others came in at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two boys . The Pole passed through the kitchen , nodded to me without speaking when our landlady told him I was to share his room , took a great kettle off the hob and went off to wash himself in the shed . The two boys were tall good-looking fellows notwithstanding the grime on their faces , and seemed inclined to be friendly . They looked upon me as a freak because I was American . One of them was nineteen , off to his militaryservice in a few months , and the other eighteen . " The Pole came back and then they went to clean up . The Pole had one I f those difficult Polish names , but they called him Kosti . He was a big I ellow , two or three inches taller than me , and heavily built . He had a pale fleshy face with a broad short nose and a big mouth . His eyes were blue and because he had n't been able to wash the coal dust off his eyebrows and eyelasheshe looked as if he was made up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startling . He was an ugly , uncouth fellow . The two boys after they 'd changed their clothes went out . The Pole sat on in the kitchen , smoking a pipe and reading the paper . I had a book in my pocket , so I took it out and began reading too . I noticed that he glanced at me once or twice and presently he put his paper down . " ' What are you reading ? ' he asked . " I handed him the book to see for himself . It was a copy of the Princesse77de Cleves that I 'd bought at the station in Paris because it was small enough to put in my pocket . He looked at it , then at me , curiously , and handed it back . I noticed an ironical smile on his lips . " ' Does it amuse you ? ' " I think it 's very interesting  --  even absorbing . ' " I read it at school at Warsaw . It bored me stiff . ' He spoke very good French , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't read anything but the newspaper and detective stories . ' " Madame Duclerc , that was our old girl 's name , with an eye on the soup that was cooking for supper , sat at the table darning socks . She told Kosti that I had been sent to her by the manager of the mine and repeated what else I had seen fit to tell her . He listened , puffing away at his pipe , and looked at me with brilliantly blue eyes . They were hard and shrewd . He asked me a few questions about myself . When I told him I had never worked in a mine before his lips broke again into an ironical smile . " You do n't know what you 're in for . No one would go to work in a mine who could do anything else . But that 's your affair and doubtless you hav your reasons . Where did you live in Paris ? ' " I told him . " At one time I used to go to Paris every year , but I kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ? It was my favorite restaurant . " That surprised me a bit because , you know , it 's not cheap . " " Far from it . " " I fancy he saw my surprise , for he gave me once more his mocking stnil but evidently did n't think it necessary to explain further . We went on talk ing in a desultory fashion and then the two boys came in . We had supper and when we 'd finished Kosti asked me if I 'd like to come to the bistro with him and have a beer . It was just a rather large room with a bar at one end of it and a number of marble-topped tables with wooden chairs around them . There was a mechanical piano and someone had put a coin in the slot and it was braying out a dance tune . Only three tables were occupied besidesours . Kosti asked me if I played belote . I 'd learnt it with some of my student friends , so I said I did and he proposed that we should play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards . I lost a beer and a second beer . Then he proposed that we should play for money . He had good cards and I had bad luck . We were playing for very small stakes , but I lost several francs . This and the beer put him in a good humour and he talked . It did n't take me long to guess , both by his way of expressing himself and by his manners , that he was a man of education . When he spoke again of Paris it was to ask me if I knew so and so and so and so , American women I had met at Elliott'swhen Aunt Louisa and Isabel were staying with him . He appeared to know then better than I did and I wondered how it was that he found himself in his present position . It was n't late , but we had to get up at the crack of dawn . " Let 's have one more beer before we go , ' said Kosti . " He sipped it and peered at me with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of then , an ill-tempered pig . " Why have you come here to work in this rotten mine ? ' he asked me . " ' For the experience . ' " Tu es fou , mon petit , ' he said . " ' And why are you working in it ? ' " He shrugged his massive , ungainly shoulders . " I entered the nobleman 's cadet school when I was a kid , my father was . r general under the Czar and I was a cavalry officer in the last war . I could n't land Pilsudski . We arranged to kill him , but someone gave us away . He hot those of us he caught . I managed to get across the frontier just in time . here was nothing for me but the Foreign Legion or a coal mine . I chose the lesser of two evils . ' " I had already told Kosti what job I was to have in the mine and he had said nothing , but now , putting his elbow on the marble-topped table , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " I knew the old trial of strength and I put my open palm against his . He laughed . Your hand wo n't be as soft as that in a few weeks . ' 1 pushed with ill my might , but I could make no effect against his huge strength and gradually he pressed my hand back and down to the table . " ' You 're pretty strong , ' he was good enough to say . There are n't many men who keep up as long as that . Listen , my helper 's no good , he 's a puny little Frenchman , he has n't got the strength of a louse . You come along with me tomorrow and I 'll get the foreman to let me have you instead . ' ' I 'd like that , ' I said . D' you think he 'll do it ? ' " ' For a consideration . Have you got fifty francs to spare ? ' " He stretched out his hand and I took a note out of my wallet . We went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and I slept like a log . " " Did n't you find the work terribly hard ? " I asked Larry . " Back-breaking at first , " he grinned . " Kosti worked it with the foreman . rud I was made his helper . At that time Kosti was working in a space about lie size of a hotel bathroom and one got to it through a tunnel so low that ru had to crawl through it on your hands and knees . It was as hot as hellthere and we worked in nothing but our pants . There was something rribly repulsive in that great white fat torso of Kosti 's ; he looked like a age slug . The row of the pneumatic cutter in that narrow space was afening . My job was to gather the blocks of coal that he hacked away andrd a basket with them and drag the basket through the tunnel to its. , omouth , where it could be loaded into a truck when the train came along at intervals on its way to the elevators . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know if that 's the normal practice . It seemed amateurish to me and it was damned hard work . At half time we knocked off for a rest and r ate our lunch and smoked . I was n't sorry when we were through for the day , and gosh , it was good to have a bath . I thought I 'd never get my feet clean ; they were as black as ink . Of course my hands blistered and they got as sore as the devil , but they healed . I got used to the work . " " How long did you stick it out ? " " I was only kept on that job for a few weeks . The trucks that carried the coal to the elevators were hauled by a tractor and the driver was a poor mechanic and the engine was always breaking down . Once he could n't get it going and he did n't seem to know what to do . Well , I 'm a pretty good mechanic , so I had a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The foreman told the manager and he sent for me and asked me if I knew about cars . The result was that he gave me the mechanic 's job ; of course it was monotonous , but it was easy , and because they did n't have any more engine trouble they were pleased with me . " Kosti was as sore as hell at my leaving him . I suited him and he 'd got used to me . I got to know him pretty well , working with him all day , going to the bistro with him after supper , and sharing a room with him . He was a funny fellow . He was the sort of man who 'd have appealed to you . He did n't mix with the Poles and we did n't go to the cafes they went to . He could n't forget he was a nobleman and had been a cavalry officer and he treated them like dirt . Naturally they resented it , but they could n't do anything about it ; he was as strong as an ox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knives or no knives , he 'd have been a match for half a dozen of them together . I got to know some of them all the same , and they told me he 'd been a cavalry officer all right in one of the smart regiments , but it was a lie about his having left Poland for political reasons . He 'd been kicked out of the Officers ' Club at Warsaw and cashiered because he 'd been caught cheatingat cards . They warned me against playing with him . They said that was why he fought shy of them , because they knew too much about him and would n't play with him . " I 'd been losing to him consistently , not much , you know , just a few francs a night , but when he won he always insisted on paying for drinks , so it did n't amount to anything really . I thought I was just having a run of bad luck or that I did n't play as well as he did . But after that I kept my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but d' you know , for the life of me I could n't see how he did it . Gosh , he was clever . I knew he simply could n't have the best cards all the time . I watched him like a lynx . He was as cunning as a fox and I guess he saw I 'd been put wise to him . One night , if ter we 'd been playing for a while , he looked at me with that rather cruel , sarcastic smile of his which was the only way he knew how to smile , and said : " Shall I show you a few tricks ? ' " He took the pack of cards and asked me to name one . He shuffled then . and he told me to choose one ; I did , and it was the card I 'd named . He dia two or three more tricks and then he asked me if I played poker . I said I did and he dealt me a hand . When I looked at it I saw I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be willing to bet a good deal on that hand , would n't you ? ' he asked . " My whole stack , ' I answered . " ' You 'd be silly . ' He put down the hand he 'd dealt himself . It was a straight flush . How it was done I do n't know . He laughed at my amaze-1nent . If I were n't an honest man I 'd have had your shirt by now . ' " You have n't done so badly as it is , ' I grinned . " ' Chicken feed . Not enough to buy a dinner at Larue 's . ' " We continued to play pretty well every night . I came to the conclusion that he cheated not so much for the money as for the fun of it . It gave him a queer satisfaction to know that he was making a fool of me , and I think he got a lot of amusement out of knowing that I was on to what he was doing and could n't see how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him and it was the other side that made him so interesting to me . I could n't reconcile the two . Though he boasted he never read anything but the paper and detective stories he was a cultivated man . He was a good talker , caustic , harsh , cynical , but it was exhilarating to listen to him . He was a devout Catholic and had a crucifix hanging over his bed , and he went to Mass every ( Sunday regularly . On Saturday nights he used to get drunk . The bistro we went to was crammed jammed full then , and the air was heavy with smoke . There were quiet , middle-aged miners with their families , and there were groups of young fellows kicking up a hell ( ) f a row , and there were men with sweaty faces round tables playing belote with loud shouts , while their wives sat by , a little behind them , and watched . The crowd and the noise had a strange effect on Kosti and he 'd grow serious and start talking  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of it then but an essay of Maeterlinck 's on Ruysbroek that I 'd read in Paris . But Kosti talked of Plotinus and Denis the Areopagite and Jacob Boehme the shoemaker and Meister Eckhart . It was fantastic to hear that great hulkingbum , who 'd been thrown out of his own world , that sardonic , bitter down-and-out speaking of the ultimate reality of things and the blessedness of union with God . It was all new to me and I was confused and excited . I was like someone who 's lain awake in a darkened room and suddenly a8iSrchink of light shoots through the curtains and he knows he only has to draw them and there the country will be spread before him in the glory of the dawn . But when I tried to get him on the subject when he was sober he got mad at me . His eyes were spiteful . " How should I know what I was talking about when I did n't know what I was saying ? ' he snapped . " But I knew he was lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew a lot . Of course he was soused , but the look in his eyes , the rapt expression on his ugly face were n't due only to drink . There was more to it than that . The first time he talked in that way he said something that I 've never forgotten , because it horrified me ; he said that the world is n't a creation , for out of nothing nothing comes , but a manifestation of the eternal nature ; well , that was all right , but then he added that evil is as direct a manifestation of the divine as good . They were strange words to ' hear in that sordid , noisy cafe , to the accompaniment of dance tunes on the , mechanical piano . " ( ii ) To give the reader a moment 's rest I am starting here upon a new section but I am doing it only for his convenience ; the conversation was uninter rupted . I may take this opportunity to say that Larry spoke without haste , often choosing his words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretend to report them exactly , I have tried to reproduce not only the matter , but the manner of his discourse . His voice , rich in tone , had a musical quality tha was grateful to the ear ; and as he talked , without gesticulation of any kind , puffing away at his pipe and stopping now and again to relight it , he looked you in the face with a pleasant , often whimsical expression in his dark eyes . " Then the spring came , late in that flat , dismal part of the country , cold and rainy still ; but sometimes a fine warm day made it hard to leave th world above ground to go down hundreds of feet in a rickety elevator , crowded with miners in their grimy overalls , into the bowels of the earth . It was spring all right , but it seemed to come shyly in that grim and sordid landscape as though unsure of a welcome . It was like a flower , a daffodil or a lily , growing in a pot on the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . One Sunday morning we were lying in bed , we always slept late on Sunday morning , and I was reading , when Kosti said to me out of a blue sky : " I 'm getting out of here . D' you want to come with me ? ' " I knew a lot of the Poles went back to Poland in the summer to get the harvest in , but it was early for that , and besides , Kosti could n't go back to Poland . " Where are you going ? ' I asked . " Tramping . Across Belgium and into Germany and down the Rhine . We could get work on a farm that would see us through the summer . ' " It did n't take me a minute to make up my mind . " It sounds fine , ' I said . " Next day we told the foreman we were through . I found a fellow who was willing to take my grip in exchange for a rucksack . I gave the clothes I did n't want or could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duclerc 's sons who was about my size . Kosti left a bag , packed what he wanted in his rucksack and the day after , as soon as the old girl had given us our coffee , we started off . " We were n't in any hurry as we knew we could n't get taken on at a farm at least until the hay was ready to cut , and so we dawdled along through France and Belgium by way of Namur and Liege and got into Germany through Aachen . We did n't do more than ten or twelve miles a day . When we liked the look of a village we stopped there . There was always some kind of an inn where we could get beds and an alehouse where we could gat something to eat and beer to drink . On the whole we had fine weather . It was grand to be out in the open air after all those months in the mine . I do n't think I 've ever realized before how good a green meadow is to look at and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out yet , but when the branches are veiled in a faint green mist . Kosti started to teach me German and I believe he spoke it as well as he spoke French . As we trudged along he would tell me the German for the various objects we passed , a cow , a horse , a man and so on , and then make me repeat simple German sentences . It made the time pass and by the time we got into Germany I could at least ask for the things I wanted . " Cologne was a bit out of our way , but Kosti insisted on going there , on account of the Eleven Thousand Virgins , he said , and when we got there he went on a bat . I did n't see him for three days and when he turned up at the room we 'd taken in a sort of workmen 's rooming-house he was very surly . He 'd got in a fight and he had a black eye and a cut on his lip . He was n't a pretty object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for twenty-four hours , and then we started to walk down the valley of the Rhine towards Darmstadt , where he said the country was good and we stood the best chance of getting work . " I never enjoyed anything more . The fine weather held and we wandered through towns and villages . When there were sights to see we stopped off and looked at them . We put up where we could and once or twice we slept in a loft on the hay . We ate at wayside inns and when we got in the wine country we turned from beer to wine . We made friends with the people in the taverns we drank in . Kosti had a sort of rough joviality that inspired them with confidence and he 'd play skat with them , that 's a German card83 game , and skin them with such bluff good humour , with the earthy jokes they appreciated , that they hardly minded losing their pfennigs to him . I practised my German on them . I 'd bought a little English-German conversa- tion grammar at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then at night , when he 'd got a couple of litres of white wine inside him , Kosti would talk in a strange morbid way of the flight from the Alone to the Alone , of the Dark Night of the Soul and of the final ecstasy in which the creature becomes one with the Beloved . But when in the early morning , as we walked through the smiling country , with the dew still on the grass , I tried to get him to tell me more , he grew so angry that he could have hit me . " ' Shut up , you fool , ' he said . What do you want with all that stuff and nonsense ? Come , let 's get on with our German . ' " You ca n't argue with a man who 's got a fist like a steam hammer and would n't think twice about using it . I 'd seen him in a rage . I knew he was capable of laying me out cold and leaving me in a ditch and I would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out . I could n't make head or tail of him . When wine had loosened his tongue and he spoke of the Ineffable , he shed the rough obscene language that he ordinarily used , like the grimy overalls he wore in the mine , and he was well spoken and even eloquent . I could n't believe he was n't sincere . I do n't know how it occurred to me , but I got the idea somehow that he 'd taken on that hard , brutal labour of the mine to mortify his flesh . I thought he hated that great , uncouth body of his and wanted to torture it and that his cheating and his bitterness and his cruelty were the revolt of his will against  --  oh , I do n't know what you 'd , : all it  --  against a deep-rooted instinct of holiness , against a desire for God that terrified and yet obsessed him . " We 'd taken our time , the spring was pretty well over and the trees were in full leaf . The grapes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dirt roads as much as we could and they were getting dusty . We were in the neighbourhood of Darmstadt and Kosti said we 'd better start looking for a job . Our money was getting short . I had half a dozen travellers ' cheques in my pocket , but I 'd made up my mind not to use them if I could possibly help it . When we saw a farmhouse that looked promising we stopped and asked if they wanted a couple of hands . I daresay we did n't look very invit- ing . We were dusty and sweaty and dirty . Kosti looked a terrible ruffian and I do n't suppose I looked much better either . We were turned down time after time . At one place the farmer said he 'd take Kosti but could n't do with me and Kosti said we were buddies and would n't separate . I told him to go ahead , but he would n't . I was surprised . I knew Kosti had taken a fancy to me , though I could n't imagine why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy he had any use for , but I would never have thought he liked me well enough to refuse a job on my account . I felt rather conscience-stricken as we walked on , because I did n't really like him , in fact I found him rather repulsive , but when I tried to say something to show I was pleased with what he 'd done , he bit my head off . " But at last our luck turned . We 'd just gone through a village in a hollow and we came to a rambling farmhouse that did n't look so bad . We knocked at the door and a woman opened it . We offered ourselves as usual . We said we did n't want any wages , but were willing to work for our board and lodging , and to my surprise instead of slamming the door in our face , she told us to wait . She called to someone inside the house and presently a man came out . He had a good stare at us and asked us where we came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me another stare when he saw I was American . He did n't seem to like it much , but anyhow he asked us to come in and have a glass of wine . He took us into the kitchen and we sat down . The woman brought a flagon and some glasses . He told us that his hired man had been gored by a bull and was in hospital and would n't be fit for anythingtill after the harvest was in . With so many men killed , and others going into the factories that were springing up along the Rhine , it was the devil 's own job to get labour . We knew that and had been counting on it . Well , to make a long story short he said he 'd take us . There was plenty of room in the house , but I suppose he did n't fancy having us there ; anyway he told us there were two beds in the hayloft and that 's where we were to sleep . " The work was n't hard . There were the cows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bad way , and we had to do something about that ; but I had some leisure . I loved the sweet-smelling meadows and in the eveningsI used to wander about and dream . It was a good life . " The household consisted of old Becker , his wife , his widowed daughterin-lawand her children . Becker was a heavy , gray-haired man in the late forties ; he 'd been through the war and still limped from a wound in the leg . It hurt him a lot and he drank to kill the pain . He was generally high by the time he got to bed . Kosti got on with him fine and they used to go down to the inn together after supper to play skat and swill wine . Frau Becker had been a hired girl . They 'd got her out of an orphanage and Becker had marriedher soon after his wife 's death . She was a good many years younger than he was , rather handsome in a way , full-blown , with red cheeks and fair hair and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to the conclusion that there was something doing there . I told him not to be a fool . We had a good job and we did n't want to lose it . He only jeered at me ; he said Becker was n't satisfying her and she was asking for it . I knew it was useless to appeal to his sense of decency , but I told him to be careful ; it might be that Becker would n't see what he was after , but there was his daughter-in-law and she was n't missing anything . " Ellie , that was her name , was a thickset , big young woman , well underthirty , with black eyes and black hair , a sallow square face and a sullen look . Shc still wore mourning for her husband killed at Verdun . She was very devout and on Sunday mornings trudged down to the village to early Mass and again in the afternoon to vespers . She had three children , one of whom had been born after her husband 's death , and she never spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little work on the farm , but spent most of her time looking after the kids , and in the evening sat by herself in the sitting-room , with the door open so that she could hear if one of them was crying , and read novels . The two women hated one another . Ellie despised Frau Becker because she was a foundling and had been a servant , and bitterlyresented her being the mistress of the house and in a position to give orders . " Ellie was the daughter of a prosperous farmer and had brought a good dowry with her . She had n't gone to the village school , but to Zwingenberg , the nearest town , where there was a girls ' gymnasium and she 'd got quite a good education . Poor Frau Becker had come to the farm when she was fourteenand if she could read and write that 's about all she could do . That was another cause of discord between the two women . Ellie lost no opportunity of showing off her knowledge , and Frau Becker , red in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to a farmer 's wife . Then Ellie would look at herhusband 's identification disc which she wore on a steel chain round her wrist and with a bitter look on her sullen face say : " Not a farmer 's wife . Only a farmer 's widow . Only the widow of a hero who gave his life for his country . ' " Poor old Becker had his work cut out to keep the peace between them . " " But what did they make of you ? " I interrupted Larry . " Oh , they thought I 'd deserted from the American Army and could n't go back to America or I 'd be put in jail . That 's how they explained that I did n't care to go down to the inn and drink with Becker and Kosti . They thought I did n't want to attract attention to myself and have the village constable asking questions . When Ellie found out I was trying to learn German she brought out her old schoolbooks and said she 'd teach me . So after supper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frau Becker in the kitchen , and I 'd read aloud to her while she corrected my accent and tried to make me understand words I could n't get the sense of . I guessed she was doing it not so much to help me as to put something over on Frau Becker . " All this time Kosti was trying to make Frau Becker and was n't getting anywhere . She was a jolly , merry woman and quite prepared to joke and laugh with him , and he had a way with women . I guess she knew what he was after and I daresay she was flattered , but when he started pinching hershe told him to keep his hands to himself and smacked his face . And I bet it was a good hard smack . " 86Larry hesitated a little and smiled rather shyly . " I 've never been the sort who thinks women are after me , but it occurredto me that  --  well , that Frau Becker had fallen for me . It made me rather uncomfortable . For one thing she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been very decent to us . She dished out the food at table and I could n't help noticing that she helped me more liberally than the others , and she seemed to me to look for opportunities of being alone with me . She 'd smile at me in what I suppose you 'd call a provocative manner . She 'd ask me if I had a girl and say that a young fellow like me must suffer for the want of it in a place like that . You know the sort of thing . I only had three shirts and they were pretty well worn . Once she said it was a disgrace that I should wear such rags and if I 'd bring them along she 'd mend them . Ellie heard her and next time we were alone said that if I had anything to mend she 'd do it . I said it did n't matter . But a day or two later I found that my socks had been darned and my shirts patched and put back on the bench in the loft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them had done it I did n't know , Of course I did n't take Frau Becker seriously ; she was a good-natured old soul and I thought it might he just motherliness on her part ; but then oneday Kosti said to me : " ' Listen , it 's not me she wants ; it 's you . I have n't got a chance . ' " Do n't talk such nonsense , ' I said to him . She 's old enough to he mymother . ' " What of it ? You go ahead , my boy , I wo n't stand in your way . She 's not so young as she might be , but she 's a fine figure of a woman . ' " ' Oh , shut up . ' " Why d' you hesitate ? Not on my account , I hope . I 'm a philosopher andI know there are as good fish in the sea as ever came out . I do n't blame her . You 're young . I 've been young too . eunesse ne dure qu'un @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kosti was so sure of what I did n't want to believe . I did n't quite know how to deal with the situation , and then I recalledvarious things that had n't struck me at the time . Things said by Ellie that I had n't paid much attention to . But now I understood them and I was pretty sure that she too knew what was happening . She 'd turn up suddenly in the kitchen when Frau Becker and I happened to be alone . I got the impression that she was watching us . I did n't like it . I thought she was out to catch us , I knew she hated Frau Becker , and if she had half a chance she 'd make trouble . Of course I knew she could n't catch us , but she was a malevolentcreature and I did n't know what lies she might n't invent and pour into old Becker 's ears . I did n't know what to do except to pretend I was such a fool I did n't see what the old girl was up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work and I did n't want to go till after we 'd got the harvest in. " 87I could n't help smiling . I could imagine what Larry had looked like then , in his patched shirt and shorts , his face and neck burnt brown by the hot sun of the Rhine valley , with his lithe slim body and his black eyes in their deep sockets . I could well believe that the sight of him set the matronly Frau Becker , so blond , so full-breasted , all of a flutter with desire . " Well , what happened ? " I asked . " Well , the summer wore on . We worked like demons there . We cut and stacked the hay . Then the cherries were ripe , Kosti and I got up on ladders and picked them , and the two women put them in great baskets and old Becker took them into Zwingenberg and sold them . Then we cut the rye . And of course there were always the animals to look after . We were up beforedawn and we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had given me up as a bad job ; as far as I could without offending her , I kept her at arm 's length . I was too sleepy to read much German in the evenings and soon after supper I 'd take myself off to our loft and fall into bed . Most evenings Becker and Kosti went to the inn down in the village , but I was fast asleep by the time Kosti came back . It was hot in the loft and I slept naked . " One night I was awakened . At the first moment I could n't make out what it was ; I was only half awake . I felt a hot hand on my mouth and I realized somebody was in bed with me . I tore the hand away and then a mouth was pressed to mine , two arms were thrown round me and I felt Frau Becker 's great breasts against my body . " Sei still , ' she whispered . Be quiet . ' " She pressed up against me and kissed my face with hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she twined her legs in mine . " Larry stopped . I giggled . " What did you do ? " He gave me a deprecating smile . He even flushed a little . " What could I do ? I could hear Kosti breathing heavily in his sleep in the bed next to mine . The situation of Joseph has always seemed to me faintly ridiculous . I was only just twenty-three . I could n't make a scene and kick her out . I did n't want to hurt her feelings . I did what was expected of me . " Then she slipped out of bed and tiptoed out of the loft . I can tell you , I heaved a sigh of relief . You know , I 'd been scared . Gosh , ' I said , what a risk to take ! ' I thought it likely that Becker had come home drunk and fallen asleep in a stupor , but they slept in the same bed , and it might be that he 'd woken up and seen his wife was n't there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't sleep well . If she 'd been awake she 'd have heard Frau Becker go downstairs and out of the house . And then , suddenly , somethingstruck me . When Frau Becker was in bed with me I 'd felt a piece of88metal against my skin . I 'd paid no attention , you know one does n't in those circumstances , and I 'd never thought of asking myself what the devil it was . And now it flashed across me . I was sitting on the side of my bed thinking and worrying about the consequences of all this and it was such a shock that I jumped up . The piece of metal was Ellie 's husband 's identification disc that she wore round her wrist and it was n't Frau Becker that had been in bed with me . It was Ellie . " I roared with laughter . I could n't stop . " It may seem funny to you , " said Larry . " It did n't seem funny to me . " " Well , now you look back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint elementof the humorous about it ? " An unwilling smile played on his lips . " Perhaps . But it was an awkward situation . I did n't know what it was going to lead to . I did n't like Ellie . I thought her a most unpleasant female . " " But how could you mistake one for the other ? " " It was pitch dark . She never said a word except to tell me to keep my trap shut . They were both big stout women . I thought Frau Becker had her eye on me . It never occurred to me for a moment that Ellie gave me a thought . She was always thinking of her husband . I lit a cigarette and thought the position over and the more I thought of it the less I liked it . It seemed to me that the best thing I could do was to get out . " I 'd often cursed Kosti because he was so hard to wake . When we were at the mine I used to have to shake the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to work . But I was thankful now that he slept so heavily . I lit my lantern and dressed , bundled my things into my rucksack  --  I had n't got much , so it did n't take a minute  --  and slipped my arms through the straps . I walked across the loft in my stocking feet and did n't put my shoes on till I got to the bottom of the ladder . I blew out the lantern . It was a dark night , with no moon , but I knew my way to the road and I turned in the direction of the village . I walked fast as I wanted to get through it before anyone was up and about . It was only twelve miles to Zwingenberg and I got there just as it was stirring . I shall never forget that walk . There was n't a sound except my footsteps on the road and now and then the crowing of a cock in a farm . Then the first grayness when it was n't yet light and not quite dark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the birds all starting to sing , and that lush green country , meadows and woods and the wheat in the fields silvery gold in the cool light of the beginning day . I got a cup of coffee at Zwingenbergand a roll , then I went to the post office and sent a wire to the American Express to have my clothes and my books sent to Bonn . " " Why Bonn ? " I interrupted . " I 'd taken a fancy to it when we stopped off there on our tramp down the Rhine . I liked the way the light shone on the roofs and the river , and its old8gnarrow streets , and its villas and gardens and avenues of chestnut trees and the rococo buildings of the university . It struck me then it would n't be a bad place to stay in for a bit . But I thought I 'd better present a respectable 1 , appearance when I got there , I looked like a tramp and I did n't think I'n inspire much confidence if I went to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a train to Frankfurt and bought myself a grip and a few clothes . I stayed in Bonn off and on for a year . " " And did you get anything out of your experience , at the mine , I means and on the farm ? " " Yes , " said Larry , nodding his head and smiling . But he did n't tell me what it was and I knew him well enough by then to ' know that when he felt like telling you something he did , but when he did n't he would turn off questions with a cool pleasantry that made it useless to insist . For I must remind the reader that he narrated all this to me ten years after it happened . Till then , when I once more came in contact with him , I had no notion where he was or how he was engaged . For all I knew he might be dead . Except for my friendship with Elliott , who kept me posted with the course of Isabel 's life and so reminded me of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iii ) Isabel was married to Gray Maturin early in the June of the year after the termination of her engagement to Larry . Though Elliott hated leaving Paris at a moment when the season was at its height and he must miss a number of grand parties , his family feeling was too strong to allow him to neglect what he thought a social duty . Isabel 's brothers were unable to leave their distant posts and so it behooved him to make the irksome journey to Chicago to give his niece away . Remembering that French aristocrats had gone to the guillotine in all their finery , he made a special journey to London to get himself a new morning coat , a dove-gray double-breasted waistcoat and a silk hat . On his return to Paris he invited me to come and see them on . He was in a state of perturbation because the gray pearl he usually wore in his necktiewould not make any sort of effect against the pale gray tie he had chosen as suitable to the festive occasion . I suggested his emerald-and-diamond pin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " But in the particular position I shall occupy I feel that a pearl is indicated . " Ile was much pleased with the marriage , which concorded with all his ideas of propriety , and he spoke of it with the unctuousness of a dowager duchess expressing herself on the suitability of a union between a scion of the La Rochefoucaulds with a daughter of the Montmorencys . As a visible mark of his satisfaction he was taking over as a wedding present , sparing no expense , a fine portrait by Nattier of a princess of the House of France90it appeared that Henry Maturin had bought for the young couple a house in Astor Street so that they should be close to where Mrs. Bradley lived and not too far from his own palatial residence on Lake Shore Drive . By a happy chance , in which I suspected the deft complicity of Elliott , Gregory Brabazonwas in Chicago at the time the purchase was made and the decoration was entrusted to him . When Elliott returned to Europe and , throwing in his hand so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight to London , he brought photographs of the result . Gregory Brabazon had let himself go . In the drawing-room and dining-room he had gone all George the Second and it was very grand . In the library , which was to be Gray 's den , he had been inspired by a room in the Amalienburg Palace at Munich , and except that there was no place in it for books it was perfect . Save for the twin beds , Louis Quinze visiting Madame de Pompadour would have found himself perfectly at home in the bedroom Gregory had provided for this young American couple , but Isabel 's bathroom would have been an eye-opener to him ; . It was all glass  --  walls , ceiling and bath  --  and on the walls silver fish meandered profusely among gilded aquatic plants . " Of course it 's a tiny house , " said Elliott , " but Henry told me the decorationset him back a hundred thousand dollars . A fortune to some people . " The ceremony was performed with such pomp as the Episcopal church could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he told me complacently , " but for a Protestant affair it did n't lack style . " The press had behaved very handsomely and Elliott negligently tossed the cuttings to me . He showed me photographs of Isabel , hefty but handsomein her wedding dress , and Gray , a massive but fine figure of a man , a trifle self-conscious in his formal clothes . There was a group of the young couple with the bridesmaids and another group with Mrs. Bradley in a sumptuous garment and Elliott holding his new ilk hat with a grace that only he could have achi:v : ! . I asked how Mrs. Bradley was . " She 's lost a good deal of weight and I do n't like her colour , but she 's pretty well . Of course the whole thing was a strain on her , but now it 's all over she 'll be able to rest up . " -A year later Isabel was delivered of a daughter , to whom , following the fashion of the moment , she gave the name of Joan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another daughter whom , following another fashion , she called Priscilla . One of Henry Maturin 's partners died and the other two under pressure soon afterwards retired , so that he entered into sole possession of the business over which he had always exercised despotic control . He realized the ambition he had long entertained and took Gray into partnership with him . The firm had never been so prosperous. 9T- " They 're making money hand over fist , my dear fellow , " Elliott told me . " Why , Gray at the age of twenty-five is making fifty thousand a year , and that 's only a beginning . The resources of America are inexhaustible . It is n't a boom , it 's just the natural development of a great country . " His chest swelled with an unwonted patriotic fervor . " Henry Maturin ca n't live forever , high blood pressure , you know , and by the time Gray 's forty he should be worth twenty million dollars . Princely , my dear fellow , princely . " Elliott kept up a fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the years went on passed on to me what she told him . Gray and Isabel were very happy , and the babies were sweet . They lived in a style that Elliott gladly admitted was eminently suitable ; they entertained lavishlyand were lavishly entertained ; he told me with satisfaction that Isabel and Gray had n't dined by themselves once in three months . Their whirl of gaiety was interrupted by the death of Mrs. Maturin , that colourless , highbornlady whom Henry Maturin had married for her connection when he was making a place for himself in , the city to which his father had come as a country bumpkin ; and out of respect for her memory for a year the young couple never entertained more than six people to dinner . " I 've always said that eight was the perfect number , " said Elliott , determined to look on the bright side of things . " It 's intimate enough to permit of general conversation and yet large enough to give the impression of a party . " Gray was wonderfully generous to his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a square-cut diamond ring and on the birth of her second a sable coat . He was too busy to leave Chicago much , but such holidays as he could take they spent at Henry Maturin 's imposing house at Marvin . Henry could deny nothing to the son whom he adored and one Christmas gave him a plantation in South Carolina so that he could get a fortnight 's duck shooting in the season . " Of course our merchant princes correspond to those great patrons of the arts of the Italian Renaissance who made fortunes by commerce . The Medici , for instance . Two kings of France were not too proud to marry the daughters of that illustrious family and I foresee the day when the crowned heads of Europe will seek the hands of our dollar princesses . What was it Shelley said ? The world 's great age begins anew , The golden years return . ' " Henry Maturin had for many years looked after Mrs. Bradley 's and Elliott 's investments and they had a well-justified confidence in his acumen . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ securities , but with the great increase in values they found their comparativelymodest fortunes increased in a manner that both surprised and delightedthem . Elliott told me that , without stirring a finger , he was nearly92twice as rich in 1926 as he had been in 1918 . He was sixty-five , his hair was gray , his face lined and there were pouches under his eyes , but he bore his years gallantly ; he was as slim and held himself as erectly as ever ; he had always been moderate in his habits and taken care of his appearance . He had no intention of submitting to the ravages of time so long as he could have his clothes made by the best tailor in London , his hair dressed and his face shaved by his own particular barber and a masseur to come in every morning to keep his elegant body in perfect condition . He had long forgotten that he had ever so far demeaned himself as to engage in a trade , and withoutever saying so outright , for he was not so stupid as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was inclined to suggest that in his youth he had been in the diplomatic service . I must admit that if I had ever had occasion to draw a portrait of an ambassador I would without hesitation have chosen Elliott as my model . But things were changing . Such of the great ladies who had advanced Elliott 's career as were still alive were well along in years . The English peeresses , having lost their lords , had been forced to surrender their mansions to daughters-in-law , and had retired to villas at Cheltenham or to modest houses in Regent 's Park . Stafford House was turned into a museum , Curzon House became the seat of an organization , Devonshire House was for sale . The yacht on which Elliott had been in the habit of staying at Cowes had passed into other hands . The fashionable persons who occupied the stage had no use for the elderly man that Elliott now was . They found him tiresome and ridiculous . They were still willing to come to his elaborate luncheon parties at Claridge 's , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another rather than to see him . He could no longer pick and choose among the invitations that once had littered his writing-table , and much more often than he would have liked anyone to know he ' uffered the humiliationof dining by himself in the privacy of his suite . Women of rank in England , when a scandal has closed the doors of society to them , develop an interest in the arts and surround themselves with painters , writers and musicians . Elliott was too proud thus to humiliate himself . " The death duties and the war profiteers have ruined English society , " he told me . " People do n't seem to mind who they know . London still has its tailors , its bootmakers and its hatters , and I trust they 'll last my time , but except for them it 's finished . My dear fellow , do you know that the St. Erths have women to wait at table . " This he said when we were walking away from Carlton House Terrace after a luncheon party at which an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-known collection of pictures and a young American , Paul Barton by name , who was there for the first time expressed a desire to see them. 93 " You 've got a Titian , have n't you ? " " We had . It 's in America now . Some old Jew offered us a packet of money for it and we were damned hard up at the time , so my governor sold it " I noticed that Elliott , bristling , threw a venomous glance at the jovial marquess and guessed that it was he that had bought the picture . He was furious at hearing himself , Virginian born and the descendant of a signatory of the Declaration , thus described . He had never in his life suffered so great an affront . And what made it worse was that Paul Barton was the object of his virulent hatred . He was a young man who had appeared in London soon after the war . He was twenty-three , blond , very good-looking , charming , a beautiful dancer and with an ample fortune . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the kindness of heart natural to him had presented him to various of his friends . Not content with this he had given him some valuable hints on conduct . Delving back into his own experience , he had shown him how it was possible , by paying small attentions to old ladies and by lending a willing ear to distinguished men , however tedious , for a stranger to make his way in society . But it was a different world that Paul Barton entered from that into which , a generation before , Elliott Templeton had penetrated by means of dogged perseverance . It was a world bent on amusing itself . Paul Barton 's high spirits , pleasing exterior and engaging manner did for him in a few weeks what Elliott had achieved only after years of industry and determination . Soon he no longer needed Elliott 's help and took small pains to conceal the fact . He was pleasant to him when they met , but in an offhand way that deeply offended the older man . Elliott did not ask people to a party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it go , and since Paul Barton was popular he continued to invite him on occasion to his weekly luncheons ; but the successful young man was generally engaged and twice he threw Elliott over at the last moment . Elliott had done this himself too often not to know it was because he had just had a more tempting invitation . " I do n't ask you to believe it , " Elliott told me , fuming , " but it 's God 's truth that when I see him now he patronizes me . ME . Titian . Titian , " he spluttered . " He would n't know a Titian if he saw one . " I had never seen Elliott so angry and I guessed his wrath was caused by his belief that Paul Barton had asked about the picture maliciously , having somehow learnt that Elliott had bought it , and would make a funny story at his expense out of the noble lord 's reply . " He 's nothing but a dirty little snob , and if there 's one thing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have been nowhere except for me . Would you believe it , his father makes office furniture . Office furniture . " He put withering scorn into the two words . " And when I tell people he simply does n't exist in America , his origins could n't be more humble , they94do n't seem to care . Take my word for it , my dear fellow , English society is as dead as the dodo . " Nor did Elliott find France much better . There the great ladies of his youth , if still alive , were given over to bridge ( a game he loathed ) , piety and the care of their grandchildren . Manufacturers , Argentines , Chileans , Americanwomen separated or divorced from their husbands , inhabited the stately houses of the aristocracy and entertained with splendour , but at their parties Elliott was confounded to meet politicians who spoke French with a vulgar accent , journalists whose table manners were deplorable , and even actors . The scions of princely families thought it no shame to marry the daughters of shopkeepers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shaddy gaiety ! The young , devoted to the mad pursuit of pleasure , thought nothing more amusing than to go from one stuffy little night club to another , drinking champagne at a hundred francs a bottle and dancing close-packed with the riffraff of the town till five o'clock in the morning . The smoke , the heat , the noise made Elliott 's head ache . This was not the Paris that he had acceptedthirty years before as his spiritual home . This was not the Paris that good Americans went to when they died. ( iv ) But Elliott had a flair . An inner monitor suggested to him that the Riviera was on the point of becoming once more the resort of rank and fashion . He knew the coast well from having often spent a few days in Monte Carlo at the Hotel de Paris on his way back from Rome to which his duties at the papal court had called him or at Cannes at the villa of one or the other of his friends . But that was in the winter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be well spoken of as a summer resort . The big hotels were remaining open ; their summer visitors were listed in the social columns of the Paris Herald and Elliott read their familiar names with approval . " The world is too much with me , " he said . " I have now reached a time of life when I am prepared to enjoy the beauties of nature . " The remark may seem obscure . It is n't really . Elliott had always felt that nature was an impediment to the social life , and he had no patience with people who could bother to go to see a lake or a mountain when they had before their eyes a Regency commode or a painting by Watteau . He had at the time a considerable sum of money to spend . Henry Maturin , urged by his son and exasperated by the sight of his friends on the stock exchange who were making fortunes overnight , had surrendered at last to the current of events and , abandoning little by little his old conservatism , had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band wagon . He wrote to Elliott that he was as much opposed to gambling as he had ever been , but this was95Inot gambling . it was an affirmation of his belief in the inexhaustible resources of the country . His optimism was based on common sense . He could see nothing to halt the progress of America . He ended by saying that he had bought on margin a number of sound securities for dear Louisa Bradley and was glad to be able to tell Elliott that she now had a profit of twenty thousand dollars . Finally , if Elliott wanted to make a little money and would allow him to act according to his judgement , he was confident that he would not be disappointed . Elliott , apt to use hackneyed quotations , remarked that he could resist anything but temptation ; the consequence of which was that from then on , instead of turning to the social intelligence as he had done for many years when the Herald was brought him with his breakfast , he gave his first attention to the reports of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his behalf that now Elliott found himself with the tidy sum of fifty thousand dollars which he had done nothing to earn . He decided to take his profit and buy a house on the Riviera . As a refuge from the world he chose Antibes , which held a strategic position between Cannes and Monte Carlo so that it could be conveniently reached from either ; but whether it was the hand of Providence or his own sure instinct that led him to choose a spot that was soon to become the centre of fashion , it is impossible to say . To live in a villa with a garden had a suburban vulgaritythat revolted his fastidious taste , so he acquired two houses in the old town looking on the sea , knocked them into one , and installed central heating , bathrooms and the sanitary conveniences that American example has forced on a recalcitrant continent . Pickling was all the rage just then , so he furnished the house with old Provencal furniture duly pickled and , surrenderingdiscreetly to modernity , with modern fabrics . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " horrors , my dear fellow , horrors "  --  whom certain misguided enthusiasts were making such a fuss about , but felt himself at long last justified in extending his patronage to the Impressionists and so adorned his walls with some very pretty pictures . I remember a Monet of people rowing on a river , a Pissarro of a quay and a bridge on the Seine , a Tahitian landscape by Gauguin and a charming Renoir of a young girl in profile with long yellow hair hanging down her back . His house when finished was fresh and gay , unusual , and simple with that simplicity that you knew could only have been achieved at great expense . Then began the most splendid period of Elliott 's life . He brought his excellentchef down from Paris and it was soon acknowledged that he had the best cuisine on the Riviera . He dressed his butler and his footman in white with gold straps on their shoulders . He entertained with a magnificence that never overstepped the bounds of good taste . The shores of the Mediterranean were littered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there on96account of the climate , some in exile , and some because a scandalous past or an unsuitable marriage made it more convenient for them to inhabit a foreign country . There were Romanoffs from Russia , Hapsburgs from Austria , Bourbons from Spain , the two Sicilys and Parma ; there were princes of the House of Windsor and princes of the House of Braganca ; there were Royal Highnesses from Sweden and Royal Highnesses from Greece : Elliott entertained them . There were princes and princesses not of royal blood , dukes and duchesses , marquesses and marchionesses from Austria , Italy , Spain , Russia and Belgium : Elliott entertained them . In winter the King of Sweden and the King of Denmark made sojourns on the coast ; now and then Alfonso of Spain paid a hurried visit : Elliott entertained them . I never ceased to admire the way in which , when he bowed with courtly grace to these exalted personages , he managed to maintain the independent demeanor of the citizen of a country in which all men are said to be born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel , bought a house on Cap Ferrat and thus saw a good deal of Elliott . I had risen so high in his good graces that sometimes he invited me to his very grandest parties . " Come as a favour to me , my dear fellow , " he would say . " Of course I know just as well as you do that royalties ruin a party . But other people like to meet them and I think one owes it to oneself to show the poor things some attention . Though heaven knows they do n't deserve it . They 're the most ungrateful people in the world ; they 'll use you , and when they have no further use for you they 'll cast you aside like a frayed shirt ; they 'll accept innumerable favours from you , but there 's not one of them who 'd cross the road to do the smallest thing for you in return . " Elliott had taken pains to get on good terms with the local authorities , and the prefect of the district and the bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often graced his table . The bishop had been a cavalry officer before entering the Church and in the war had commanded a regiment . He was a rubicund , stoutish man , who affected the rough-and-ready language of the barracks , and his austere , cadaverous vicar general was always on pins and needles lest he should say something scandalous . He listened with a deprecating smile when his superior told his favourite stories . But the bishop conducted his diocese with remarkable competence and his eloquence in the pulpit was no less moving than his sallies at the luncheon table were amusing . He approved of Elliott for his pious generosity to the Church and liked him for his amiability and the good food he provided ; and the two became good friends . Elliott could thus flatter himself that he was making the best of both worlds and , if I may venture so to put it , effecting a very satisfactory working arrangement between God and Mammon . Elliott was house-proud and he was anxious to show his new house to his sister ; he had always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he97wanted her to see the style in which he now lived and the friends he hobnobbedwith . It was the definitive answer to her hesitations . She would have to admit that he had made good . He wrote and asked her to come over with Gray and Isabel , not to stay with him , for he had no room , but to stay as his guests at the near-by Hotel du Cap . Mrs. Bradley replied that her travelling days were over , for her health was indifferent and she thought she was better off at home ; and in any case it was impossible for Gray to absent himself from Chicago ; business was booming and he was making a great deal of money and had to stay put . Elliott was attached to his sister and her letter alarmed him . He wrote to Isabel . She replied by cable that , though her mother was so far from well that she had to stay in bed one day a week , she was in no immediate danger and indeed with care might be expected to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest and , with his father there to look after things , there was no reason why he should not take a holiday ; so , not that summer but the next , she and Gray would come over . On October the 23d , 1929 , the New York market broke. ( v ) I was in London then and at first we in England did not realize how grave the situation was nor how distressing its results would be . For my own part though chagrined at losing a considerable sum , it was for the most part paper profits that I lost , and when the dust had settled I found myself little the poorer in cash . I knew that Elliott had been gambling heavily and feared that he was badly hit , but I did not see him till we both returned to the Riviera for Christmas . He told me then that Henry Maturin was dead and Gray ruined . I know little of business matters and I daresay that my account of the events , told me by Elliott , will seem confused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had befallen the firm was due in part to Henry Maturin 's self-will and in part to Gray 's rashness . Henry Maturin at first would not believe that the break was serious , but persuaded himself that it was a plot of the New York brokers to put a quick one over their provincial brethren , and setting his teeth he poured forth money to support the market . He raged against the Chicago brokers who were letting themselves be stampeded by those scoundrels in New York . He had always prided himself on the fact that none of his smaller clients , widows with settled incomes , retired officers and such like , had ever lost a penny by following his advice , and now , instead of letting them take a loss , he supported their accounts out of his own pocket . He said he was prepared to go broke , he could make another fortune , but he could never hold up his head again if the little people who trusted him lost their all . He thought he was magnanimous ; he was only98vain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart attack . He was in his sixties , he had always worked hard , played hard , eaten too much and drunk heavily ; after a few hours of agony he died of coronary thrombosis . Gray was left to deal with the situation alone . He had been speculating extensively on the side , without the knowledge of his father , and was personallyin the greatest difficulty . His efforts to extricate himself failed . The banks would not lend him money ; older men on the exchange told him that the only thing was to throw in the sponge . I am not clear about the rest of the story . He was unable to meet his obligations and was , I understand , declaredbankrupt ; he had already mortgaged his own house and was glad to hand it over to the mortgagees ; his father 's house on Lake Shore Drive and the house at Marvin were sold for what they would fetch ; Isabel sold her jewels : all that was left them was the plantation in South Carolina , which was settled on Isabel but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wiped out . " And what about you , Elliott ? " I asked . " Oh , I 'm not complaining , " he answered  --  airily . " God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb . " I did not question him further , for his financial affairs were no business of mine , but whatever his losses were I presumed that like the rest of us he had suffered . The depression did not at first hit the Riviera badly . I heard of two or three people who had lost a good deal , many villas remained closed for the winter and several were put up for sale . The hotels were far from full and the Casino at Monte Carlo complained that the season was poor . But it was not for a couple of years that the draught made itself felt . Then an estate agent told me that on the stretch of coast that reaches from Toulon to the Italian border there were forty-eight thousand properties , large and small , to be sold . The shares of the Casino slumped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to attract . The only foreigners to be seen were those who had always been so poor that they could n't be poorer , and they spent no money because they had no money to spend . The shopkeeperswere in despair . But Elliott neither diminished his staff nor lessened their wages as many did ; he continued to provide choice food and choice wines to royal and titled persons . He bought himself a large new car , which he imported from America and on which he had to pay a tremendous duty . He gave generously to the charity the bishop had organized to provide free meals for the families of the workless . In fact he lived as though there had never been a crisis and half the world were not staggering from its effects . I discovered the reason by chance : Elliott had by this time ceased to go to England except for a fortnight once a year to buy clothes , but he still transferred his establishment to his apartment in Paris for three months in99the autumn and for May and June , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's friends ; he liked the summer there , partly on account of the bathing , but chiefly , I think , because the hot weather gave him the opportunity to indulge in a gaiety of dress that his sense of decorum had always forced him to eschew . He would appear then in trousers of startling colour , red , blue , green or yellow , and with them wear singlets of contrasting hue , mauve , violet , puce or harlequin , and would accept the compliments his attire clamoured for with the deprecating grace of an actress who is told that she has played a new role divinely . I happened to be spending a day in Paris in the spring on my way back to Cap Ferrat and had asked Elliott to lunch with me . We met in the Ritz bar , no longer thronged with college boys come from America to have a good time , but as deserted as a playwright after the first night of an unsuccessfulplay . We had a cocktail , a transatlantic habit with which Elliott had at last become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished , he suggested that we should go round the curio shops , and though I told him I had no money to spend I was glad enough to accompany him . We walked through the Place Vendome and he asked if I would mind going into Charvet 's for a moment ; he had ordered some things and wanted to know if they were ready . It appeared that he was having some undershirts made , and some drawers , and he was having his initials embroidered on them . The undershirts had not come in yet , but the drawers were there and the shop assistant asked Elliott if he would like to see them . " I would , " said he , and when the man had gone to fetch them added to me : " I have them made to order on a pattern of my own . " They were brought , and to me , except that they were of silk , looked exactly like the drawers I had frequently bought for myself at Macy 's ; but what caught my eye was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count 's crown . I did not say a word . " Very nice , very nice , " said Elliott . " Well , when the undershirts are ready you 'll send them along . " We left the shop and Elliott , as he walked away , turned to me with a smile . " Did you notice the crown ? To tell you the truth , I 'd forgotten about it when I asked you to come in to Charvet 's . I do n't think I 've had occasion to tell you that His Holiness has been graciously pleased to revive in my favour my old family title . " " Your what ? " I said , startled out of my politeness . Elliott raised a disapproving eyebrow . " Did n't you know ? I am descended in the female line from the Count de Lauria who came over to England in the suite of Philip the Second and married a maid of honour of Queen Mary . " too " Our old friend Bloody Mary ? " " That , I believe , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't think I ever told you that I spent September of ' 29 in Rome . I thought it a bore having to go because of course Rome is empty then , but it was fortunate for me that my sense of duty prevailed over my desire for worldly pleasures . My friends at the Vatican told me that the crash was coming and strongly advised me to sell all my American securities . The Catholic Church has the wisdom of twenty centuries behind it and I did n't hesitate for a moment . I cabled to Henry Maturin to sell everything and buy gold , and I cabled to Louisa to tell her to do the same . Henry cabled back asking me if I was crazy and said he 'd do nothing until I confirmed the instructions . I immediately cabled in the most peremptory manner , telling him to carry them out and to cable me that he had done so . Poor Louisa paid no attention to my advice and suffered for it . " " So when the crash came you were sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which I see no occasion for you to use , but it expresses my situation with a good deal of accuracy . I lost nothing ; in fact I had made what you would probably call a packet . I was able some time later to buy back my securities for a fraction of their original cost , and since I owed it all to what I can only describe as the direct interpositionof Providence I felt it only right and proper that I should do some , . thing for Providence in return . " " Oh , and how did you set about that ? " " Well , you know that the Duce has been reclaiming great tracts of land in the Pontine Marshes and it was represented to me that His Holiness was gravely concerned at the lack of places of worship for the settlers . So , to cut a long story short , I built a little Romanesque church , an exact copy of one I knew in Provence , and perfect in every detail , which , though I say it myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I was lucky enough to find an old stained-glass window representing St. Martin in the act of cutting his cloak in two to give half of it to a naked beggar , and as the symbolism seemed so apt I bought it and placed it over the high altar . " I did n't interrupt Elliott to ask him what connection he saw between the Saint 's celebrated action and the rake-off on the pretty penny he had made by selling out in the nick of time which , like an agent 's commission , he was paying a higher power . But to a prosaic person like me symbolism is often obscure . He went on . " When I was privileged to show the photographs to the Holy Father , he was gracious enough to tell me that he could see at a glance that I was a man of impeccable taste , and he added that it was a pleasure to him to find in this degenerate age someone who combined devotion to the Church with such rare artistic gifts . A memorable experience , my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ + ; ue was more surprised than 1 when shortly after . wards it was intimated to nie that he had been pleased to confer a title upon me . As an American citizen I feel it more modest not to use it , except of course at the Vatican , and I have forbidden my Joseph to address me as Monsieur le Comte , and I trust you will respect my confidence . I do n't wish it bruited abroad . But I would not like His Holiness to think that I do not value the honour that he has done me and it is purely out of respect for him that I have the crown embroidered on my personal linen . I do n't mind telling you that I take a modest pride in concealing my rank under the sober pin stripe of an American gentleman . " We parted . Elliott told me he would come down to the Riviera at the end of June . He did not do so . He had just made his arrangements to transferhis staff from Paris , intending to drive down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect order on his arrival , when he received a cable from Isabel to say that her mother had suddenly taken a turn for the worse . Elliott , besides being fond of his sister , had , as I have said , a strong sense of family feeling . He took the first ship out of Cherbourg and from New York went to Chicago . He wrote to tell me that Mrs. Bradley was very ill and grown so thin that it was a shock to him . She might last a few weeks longer or even a few months , but in any case he felt it his sad duty to remain with her till the end . He said he found the great heat more supportablethan he had expected , but the lack of congenial society only tolerable because at such a moment he had in any case no heart for it . He said he was disappointed with the way his fellow-countrymen had reacted to the depression ; he would have expected them to take their misfortunewith more equanimity . Knowing that nothing is easier than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Elliott , richer now than he had ever been in his life , was perhaps hardly entitled to be severe . He ended by giving me messages to several of his friends and bade me by no means to forget to explain to everyone I met why it was that his house must remain closed for the summer . Little more than a month later I received another letter from him to tel. ' me that Mrs. Bradley had died . He wrote with sincerity and emotion . 1 would never have thought him capable of expressing himself with such dignity , real feeling and simplicity , had I not long known that notwithstandinghis snobbishness and his absurd affectations Elliott was a kindly , affectionate and honest man . In the course of this letter he told me that Mrs. Bradley 's affairs appeared to be in some disorder . Her elder son , a diplomatist , being charge d'aflaires in Tokyo during the absence of the ambassador , had been of course unable to leave his post . Her second son , Templeton , who had been in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in due course recalled to Washington and occupied a re-IO2sponsible position in the State Department . He had come with his wife to Chicago when his mother 's condition was recognized as hopeless , but had been obliged to return to the capital immediately after the funeral . In these circumstances Elliott felt that he must remain in America until things were straightened out . Mrs. Bradley had divided her fortune equally between her three children , but it appeared that her losses in the crash of ' 29 had been substantial . Fortunately they had found a purchaser for the farm at Marvin . Elliott in his letter referred to it as dear Louisa 's country place . " It is always sad when a family has to part with its ancestral home , " he wrote , " but of late years I have seen this forced upon so many of my English friends that I feel that my nephews and Isabel must accept the inevitable with the same courage and resignation that they have . Noblesse oblige . " They had been lucky too in disposing of Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scheme afoot to tear down the row of houses in one of which Mrs. Bradley lived and build in their stead a great block of apartments , but it had been held up by her obstinate determination to die in the house in which she had lived . But no sooner was the breath out of her body than the promoters came forward with an offer and it was promptly accepted . But even at that Isabel was left very ill provided for . After the crash Gray had tried to get a job , even as a clerk in the office of such of the brokers as had weathered the storm , but there was no business . He applied to his old friends to give him something to do , however humble and however badly paid , but he applied in vain . His frenzied efforts to stave off the disaster that finally overwhelmed him , the burden of anxiety , the humiliation , resulted in a nervous breakdown and he began to have headaches so severe that he was incapacitated for twenty-four hours and as limp as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Isabel that they could not do better than go down with the children to the plantation in South Carolina till Gray regained his health . In its day it had brought in a hundredthousand dollars a year for its rice crop , but for long now had been no more than a wilderness of marsh and gumwood , useful only to sportsmenwho wanted to shoot duck , and no purchaser could be found for it . There they had lived off and on since the crash and there they proposed to return till conditions improved and Gray could find employment . " I could n't allow that , " Elliott wrote . " Why , my dear fellow , they live like pigs . Isabel without a maid , no governess for the children , and only a couple of coloured women to look after them . So I 've offered them my apartment in Paris and proposed that they should stay there till things change in this fantastic country . I shall provide them with a staff , as a matter of fact my kitchen maid is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I can easily find someone to take her place . I shall arrange to settle the accounts myself so that Isabel can spend her small income on her clothes and the10menus plaisirs of the family . This means of course that I shall spend much more of my time on the Riviera and so hope to see a great deal more of you , my dear fellow , than I have in the past . London and Paris being now what they arc I 'm really more at home on the Riviera . It 's the only place remainingwhere I can meet people who speak my own language . I daresay I shall go to Paris now and then for a few days , but when I do , I do n't in the least mind pigging it at the Ritz . I 'm glad to say that I 've at long last persuaded Gray and Isabel to accede to my wishes and I 'm bringing them all over as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made . The furniture and the pictures ( very poor in quality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) are being sold the week after next and meanwhile , as I thought to live in the house till the last moment would be painful to them , I have brought them to stay with me at the Drake . I shall settle them in when we get to Paris and then come down to the Riviera . Do n't forget to remember me to your royal neighbour . " Who could deny that Elliott , that arch-snob , was also the kindest , most considerate and generous of men ? CHAPTER FOUR ( i ) Eta.torr , having installed the Maturins in his spacious apartment on the Left Bank , returned to the Riviera at the end of the year . He had planned his house to suit his own convenience and there was no room in it for a family of four , so that , even if he had wanted to , he could not have had them to stay with him there . I do not think he regretted it . He was well aware that as a man by himself he was a more desirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a nephew , and he could hardly expect to arrange his own distinguished little parties ( a matter over which he took immense trouble ) if he had to count invariably on the presence of two house guests . " It 's much better for them to settle down in Paris and accustom themselves to civilized life . Besides , the two girls are old enough to go to school and I 've found one not far from my apartment which I 'm assured is very select . " In consequence of this I did not see Isabel till the spring when , because I had some work to do that made it desirable for me to spend some weeks there , I went to Paris and took a couple of rooms in a hotel just out of the Place Vendome . It was a hotel I frequented , not only for its convenient104situation , but because it had an air . It was a big old house built around a courtyard and it had been an inn for close upon two hundred years . The bathrooms were far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their iron beds , painted white , their old-fashioned white counterpanes and their huge armoires a glace had a poverty-stricken look ; but the parlours were furnished with fine old furniture . The sofa , the arm . chairs , dated from the gaudy reign of Napoleon the Third , and , though I could not say they were comfortable , they had a florid charm . In that room I lived in the past of the French novelists . When I looked at the Empire clock under its glass case I thought that a pretty woman in ringlets and a flounced dress might have watched the minute hand move as she waited for a visit from Rastignac , the well-born adventurer whose career in novel after novel Balzac followed from his humble beginnings to his ultimate grandeur . Dr. Bianchon , the physician who was so real to Balzac that when he lay dying he said : " Only Bianchon can save me , " might well have come into that room to feel the pulse and look at the tongue of a noble dowager from the provinces who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawsuit and had called in a doctor for a passing ailment . At that bureau a lovesick woman in a crinoline , her hair parted in the middle , may have written a passionate letter to her faithless lover or a peppery old gentleman in a green frock coat and a stock indited an angry epistle to his extravagantson . The day after my arrival I called up Isabel and asked if she would give me a cup of tea if I came along at five . It was ten years since I 'd seen her . She was reading a French novel when I was ushered into the drawingroomby a staid butler and getting up she took both my hands and greeted me with a warm and winning smile . I had never'seen her more than a dozen times , and only twice alone , but she made me feel at once that we were not casual acquaintances but old friends . The ten years that had passed had reduced the gulf that separated the young girl from the middle-aged man and I was no longer conscious of the disparity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman of the world she treated me as if I were her contemporary , and in five minutes we were chatting as frankly and as unconstrainedly as though we were playmates who had been in the habit of meeting without interruption . She had acquired ease , self-possessionand assurance . But what chiefly struck me was the change in her appearance . I remembered her as a pretty , bouncing girl who threatened to run to fat ; I do not know whether , realizing this she had taken heroic measures to reduce her weight or whether it was an unusual , though happy , accident of childbearing ; but now she was as slender as anyone could wish . The mode of the moment accentuated this . She was in black , and at a glance I noticedsocthat her silk dress , neither too plain nor too fancy , had been made by one of the best dressmakers in Paris , and she wore it with the careless confidenceof a woman to whom it is second nature to wear expensive clothes . Ten years before , even with Elliott to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side and she had worn them as though she were not quite at home in them . Marie Louise de Florimond could not have said now that she lacked chic . She had chic to the tips of her rose-painted nails . Her features had fined down and it occurred to me that she had as pretty and as straight a nose as I had ever seen on a woman 's face . There was not a line on her forehead or under her hazel eyes , and though her skin had lost the fresh bloom of extreme youth , its texture was as fine as ever ; it obviously owed something now to lotions , creams and massage , but they had given it a soft , transparent delicacy that was singularly attractive . Her thin cheeks were very faintly rouged and her mouth was painted with discretion . She wore her bright brown hair bobbed as was the fashion of the moment and marcelled . She had no rings on her fingers , and I remembered that Elliott had told me that she had sold her jewellery ; her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At that period women wore short frocks in the daytime and I saw that her legs in champagne-coloured stockings were shapely , long and slender . Legs are the undoing of many a comely woman ; Isabel 's legs , as a girl her most unfortunate trait , were now uncommonlygood . In fact from the pretty girl whose glowing health , high spirits and brilliant colour had given her attractiveness she was become a beautiful woman . That she owed her beauty in some degree to art , discipline and mortification of the flesh did not seem to matter . The result was vastly satisfactory . It might be that the grace of her gestures , the felicity of her carriage , had been acquired by taking thought , but they had a look of perfect spontaneity . I conceived the notion that these four months in Paris had put the finishing touches to a work of conscious art that had been years in the making . Elliott , even in his most censorious mood , could not but have approved of her ; I , a person less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to Mortefontaine to play golf , but she told me he would be in presently . " And you must see my two little girls . They 've gone to the Tuileries Gardens , but they ought to be in soon . They 're sweet . " We talked of one thing and another . She liked being in Paris and they were very comfortable in Elliott 's apartment . Before leaving them he had made them acquainted with such of his friends as he thought they would like and they had already a pleasant circle of acquaintances . He had pressed them to entertain as abundantly as he had been in the habit of doing . " You know , it tickles me to death to think that we 're living like quite rich people when really we 're absolutely broke . " Io6 " Is it as bad as that ? " She chuckled , and now I remembered the light , gay laugh that I had found so pleasing in her ten years before . " Gray has n't a penny and I have almost exactly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I would n't because I thought we could n't possibly live on it and now I 've got two children besides . It 's rather funny , is n't it ? " " I 'm glad you can see the joke of it . " " What news have you of Larry ? " " I ? None . I have n't set eyes on him since before you were last in Paris . I knew slightly some of the people he used to know and I did ask them what had become of him , but that was years ago . No one seemed to know anything about him . He just vanished . " " We know the manager of the bank in Chicago where Larry has his account and he told us that every now and then he got a draft from some queer place . China , Burma , India . He seems to have been getting around . " I did not hesitate to put the question that came to the tip of my tongue . After all , if you want to know something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish now that you had married him ? " She smiled engagingly . " I 've been very happy with Gray . He 's been a wonderful husband . You know , until the crash came we had a grand time together . We like the same people , and we like doing the same things . He 's very sweet . And it 's nice being adored ; he 's just as much in love with me now as when we first married . He thinks I 'm the most wonderful girl in the world . You ca n't imagine how kind and considerate he is . It was quite absurd how generous he was ; you see , he thought nothing was too good for me . D' you know , he 's never said an unkind or harsh thing to me all these years we 've been married . Oh , I 've been very lucky . " I asked myself if she thought she 'd answered my question . I changed the conversation . " Tell me about your little girls . " As I spoke the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see for yourself . " In a moment they came in followed by a nursery governess and I was introduced first to Joan , the elder , and then to Priscilla . Each in turn gave a polite little knick as she took my hand . One was eight and the other six . They were tall for their age ; Isabel of course was tall and Gray , I remembered , was immense ; but they were pretty only in the way all children are pretty . They looked frail . They had their father 's black hair and their mother 's hazel eyes . The presence of a stranger did not make them shy , and they talked eagerly to her of their doings in the gardens . They castI07eager eyes on the dainties Isabel 's cook had provided for tea , but which neither of us had touched , and being given permission to have one thing were thrown into a small agony of doubt as to which to choose . It was pleasant to see the demonstrative affection they had for their mother and the three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had eaten the little cake each had selected , Isabel sent them away and they went without a word of expostulation . I received the impression that she was bringing them up to do as they were told . When they were gone I said the usual things one says to a mother about her children and Isabel accepted my compliments with evident , but somewhatcasual , pleasure . I asked her how Gray was liking Paris . " Well enough . Uncle Elliott left us a car so he can go and play golf almost every day and he 's joined the Travellers Club and he plays bridge there . Of course , Uncle Elliott 's offer to support us in this apartment has been a godsend . Gray 's nerves went all to pieces and he still has those terrible headaches ; even if he could get a job he is n't really fit to take it ; and naturally that worries him . He wants to work , he feels he ought to , and it humiliates him not to be wanted . You see , he feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't work he may just as well be dead . He ca n't bear his feeling of being a drug on the market , and I only got him to come here by persuading him that rest and change would bring him back to normalcy . But I know he wo n't be really happy till he gets back into har-ness . " " I 'm afraid you 've had a very rough time these last two and a half years . " " Well , you know , when the crash came at first I simply could n't believe it . It seemed inconceivable to me that we should be ruined . I could understand that other people should be ruined , but that we should be  --  well , itjust seemed impossible . I went on thinking that something would happen to save us at the last moment . And then , when the final blow came , I felt that life was n't worth living any more , I did n't think I could face the future ; it was too black . For a fortnight I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to part with everything , knowing there would n't be any fun any more , having to do without everything I liked  --  and then at the end of a fortnight I said : Oh , to hell with it , I 'm not going to give it another thought , ' and I promise you I never have . I do n't regret anything . I had a lot of fun while it lasted and now it 's gone , it 's gone . " " It 's obvious that ruin is easier to bear in a luxurious apartment in a fashionable quarter , with a competent butler and an excellent cook free and for nothing , and when one can cover one 's haggard bones with a dress by Chanel , is n't it ? " " Lanvin , " she giggled . " I see you have n't changed much in ten years . Io8I do n't suppose you 'll believe me , being a cynical brute , but I 'm not sure if I 'd have accepted Uncle Elliott 's offer except for Gray and the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed perfectly well on the plantation and we 'd have grown rice and rye and corn and kept pigs . After all I was born and raised on a farm in Illinois . " " In a manner of speaking , " I smiled , knowing that in point of fact she had been born in an expensive clinic in New York . At this point Gray came in . It is true that I had only seen him two or three times twelve years before , but I had seen a photograph of him with his bride ( Elliott kept it in a splendid frame on his piano along with signed photographs of the King of Sweden , the Queen of Spain and the Duc de Guise ) and I had a fair recollection of him . I was taken aback . His hair had receded on the temples and there was a small bald patch on the crown , his face was puffy and red , and he had a double chin . He had put on a lot of weight during years of good living and hard drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obese . But the thing I most noticed was the expression of his eyes . I remembered quite well the trusting , open frankness of their Irish blue , when the world was before him and he had n't a care in the world ; now I seemed to see in them a sort of puzzled dismay , and even if I had n't known the facts I think I might have guessed that something had occurred to destroy his confidence in himself and in the ordered course of events . I felt a kind of diffidence in him , as though he had done wrong , though unwittingly , and were ashamed . It was plain that his nerve was shaken . He greeted me with pleasant cordiality and indeed seemed as glad to see me as if I were an old friend , but I had the impression that his rather noisy heartiness was a habit of manner that scarcely corresponded with his inner feeling . Drinks were brought in and he mixed us a cocktail . He 'd played a couple of rounds of golf and was satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the difficulties he had surmounted over one of the holes and Isabel listened with an appearance of lively interest . After a few minutes , having made a date to take them to dine and see a play , I left. ( ii ) I fell into the habit of dropping in to see Isabel three or four times a week in the afternoon after my day 's work was over . She was generally alone at that hour and glad to have a gossip . The persons to whom Elliott had introduced her were much older than she and I discovered that she had few friends of her own generation . Mine were for the most part busy till dinnertime and I found it more agreeable to talk with Isabel than to go to my club and play bridge with rather grouchy Frenchmen who did notT09particularly welcome the intrusion of a stranger . Her charming way of treating me as if she and I were of an age made conversation easy and we joked and laughed and chaffed one another , chatting now about ourselves , now about our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the time passed very agreeably . One of the defects of my character is that I can never grow used to the plainness of people ; however sweet a disposition a friend of mine may have , years of intimacy can never reconcile me to his bad teeth or lopsided nose : on the other hand I never cease to delight in his comeliness and after twenty years of familiarity I am still able to take pleasure in a well-shaped brow or the delicate line of a cheekbone . So I never came into Isabel 's presence without feeling anew a little thrill of pleasure in the perfection of her oval face , in the creamy delicacy of her skin and in the bright warmth of her hazel eyes . Then a very unexpected thing happened. ( iii ) In all big cities there are self-contained groups that exist without intercommunication , small worlds within a greater world that lead their lives , their members dependent upon one another for companionship , as though they inhabited islands separated from each other by an unnavigable strait . Of no city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris . There high society seldom admits outsiders into its midst , the politicians live in their own corrupt circle , the bourgeoisie , great and small , frequent one another , writers congregate with writers ( it is remarkable in Andre Gide 's Journal to see with how few people he seems to have been intimate who did not follow his own calling ) , painters hobnob with painters and musicians with musicians . The same thing is true of London , but in a less marked degree ; there birds of a feather flock much less together , and there are a dozen houses where at the same table you may meet a duchess , an actress , a painter , a member of Parliament , a lawyer , a dressmaker and an author . The events of my life have led me at one time and another to dwell transitorily in pretty well all the worlds of Paris , even ( through Elliott ) in the closed world of the Boulevard St. Germain ; but that which I like best , better than the discreet circle that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , better than the cosmopolitan crew that patronized Larue 's and the Cafe de Paris , better than the noisy sordid gaiety of Montmartre , is that section of which the artery is the Boulevard du Montparnasse . In my youth I spent a year in a tiny apartment near the Lion de Belfort , on the fifth floor , from which I had a spacious view of the cemetery . Montparnasse has still for me the tranquil air of a provincial town that was characteristic of it then . When I pass through the dingy narrow Rue d'Odessa I rememberTTOwith a pang the shabby restaurant where we used to foregather to dine , painters and illustrators and sculptors , I , but for Arnold Bennett on occasion , the only writer , and sit late discussing excitedly , absurdly , angrily painting and literature . It is still a pleasure to me to stroll down the boulevardand look at the young people who are as young as I was then and invent stories for myself about them . When I have nothing better to do I take a taxi and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is no longer what it was then , the meeting place exclusively of Bohemia ; the small tradesmen of the neighbourhood have taken to visiting it , and strangers from the other side of the Seine come to it in the hope of seeing a world that has ceased to exist . Students come to it still , of course , painters and writers , but most of them are foreigners ; and when you sit there you hear around you as much Russian , Spanish , German and English as French . But I have a notion that they are saying very much the same sort of things as we said forty years ago , only they speak of Picasso instead of Manet and of Andre Breton instead of Guillaume Apollinaire . My heart goes out to them . When I had been in Paris about a fortnight I was sitting one evening at the Dome and since the terrace was crowded I had been forced to take a table in the front row . It was fine and warm . The plane trees were just bursting into leaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lightheartednessand alacrity that was peculiar to Paris . I felt at peace with myself , but not lethargically , with exhilaration rather . Suddenly a man , walking past me , stopped and with a grin that displayed a set of very white teeth said : " Hello ! " I looked at him blankly . He was tall and thin . He wore no hat and he had a mop of dark brown hair that badly needed cutting . His upper lip and his chin were concealed by a thick brown beard . His forehead and his neck were deeply tanned . He wore a frayed shirt , without a tie , a brown , threadbare coat and a pair of shabby gray slacks . He looked a bum and to the best of my belief I had never seen him before . I put him down for one of those good-for-nothings who have gone to the devil in Paris and I expected him to pull a hard-luck story to wheedle a few francs out of me for a dinner and a bed . He stood in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white teeth , with a look of amusement in his dark eyes . " You do n't remember me ? " he said . " I 've never set eyes on you in my life . " I was prepared to give him twenty francs , but I was n't prepared to let him get away with the bluff that we knew one another . " Larry , " he said . " Good God ! Sit down . " He chuckled , stepped forward and took the empty chair at my table . " Have a drink . " I beckoned to the waiter . " How could you expect me to recognize you with all that hair on your face ? " IIIThe waiter came and he ordered an orangeade . Now that I looked at him I remembered the peculiarity of his eyes , which came from the black of the iris being as black as that of the pupil and which gave them at once intensity and opaqueness . " How long have you been in Paris ? " I asked . " A month . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while . " While I asked these questions my mind was busy . I noticed that the cuffs of his trousers were ragged and that there were holes in the elbows of his coat . He looked as destitute as any beachcomber I had ever met in an Eastern port . It was hard in those days to forget the depression and I wondered whether the crash of ' 29 had left him penniless . I did n't much like the thought of that and not being a person to beat about the bush I asked him outright : " Are you down and out ? " " No , I 'm all right . What makes you think that ? " " Well , you look as if you could do with a square meal and the things you 've got on are only fit for the garbage can . " " Are they as bad as all that ? I never thought about it . As a matter of fact I have been meaning to get myself a few odds and ends , but I never seem able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shy or proud and I did n't see why I should put up with that sort of nonsense . " Do n't be a fool , Larry . I 'm not a millionaire , but I 'm not poor . If you 're short of cash let me lend you a few thousand francs . That wo n't break me . " He laughed outright . " Thanks a lot , but I 'm not short of cash . I 've got more money than I can spend . " " Notwithstanding the crash ? " " Oh , that did n't affect me . Everything I had was in government bonds . I do n't know whether they went down in value , I never enquired , but I do know that Uncle Sam went on paying up on the coupons like the decent old party he is . In point of fact I 've been spending so little during the last few years , 1 must have quite a bit in hand . " " Where have you come from now then ? " " India . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabel told me . She apparently knows the manager of your bank in Chicago . " " Isabel ? When did you last see her ? " " Yesterday . " " She 's not in Paris ? " ' She is indeed . She 's living in Elliott Templeton 's apartment . " " That 's grand . I 'd love to see her . " Though I was watching his eyes pretty closely while we were exchanging these remarks I could discern only a natural surprise and pleasure , but no feeling more complicated . " Gray 's there too . You know they 're married ? " " Yes , Uncle Bob  --  Dr. Nelson , my guardian  --  wrote and told me , but he died some years ago . " It occurred to me that with this break in what appeared his only link with Chicago and his friends there he probably knew nothing of what had happened . I told him of the birth of Isabel 's two daughters , of the death of Henry Maturin and Louisa Bradley , of Gray 's complete ruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ? " " No . " For the first time in forty years Elliott was not spending the spring in Paris . Though looking younger he was now seventy and as usual with men of that age there were days when he felt tired and ill . Little by little he had given up taking any but walking exercise . He was nervous about his health and his doctor came to see him twice a week to thrust into an alternate buttock a hypodermic needle with the fashionable injection of the moment . At every meal , at home or abroad , he took from his pocket a little gold box from which he extracted a tablet which he swallowed with the reserved air of one performing a religious rite . His doctor had recommended him to take the cure at Montecatini , a watering place in the north of Italy , and after this he proposed to go to Venice to look for a font of a design suitable to his Romanesque church . He was less unwilling to leave Paris unvisited since each year he found it socially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resented it when he was invited to meet only persons of his own age , and the young he found vapid . The adornment of the church he had built was now a main interest of his life and here he could indulge his ineradicable passion for buying works of art with the comfortable assurance that he was doing it to the glory of God . He had found in Rome an early altar of honey-coloured stone and had been dickering in Florence for six months for a triptych of the Siennese school to put over it . Then Larry asked me how Gray was liking Paris . " I 'm afraid he 's feeling rather lost here . " I tried to explain to him how Gray had struck me . He listened to me with his eyes fixed on my face with a meditative , unblinking gaze that suggested to me , I do n't know why , that he was listening to me not with his ears , but some inner , more sensitive organ of hearing . It was queer and not very comfortable . II2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I finished . " Yes , I 'd love to see them . I suppose I shall find the address in the phone book . " " But if you do n't want to scare them out of their wits and drive the children into screaming hysterics , I think you 'd be wise to have your hair cut and your beard shaved . " He laughed . " I 've been thinking of it . There 's no object in making myself conspicuous . " " And while you 're about it you might get yourself a new outfit . " " I suppose I am a bit shabby . When I came to leave India I found that I had nothing but the clothes I stand up in . " He looked at the suit I was wearing and asked me who my tailor was . I told him , but added that he was in London and so could n't be of much use to him . We dropped the subject and he began to talk again of Gray and Isabel . " I 've been seeing quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're very happy together . I 've never had a chance of talking to Gray alone , and anyway I daresay he would n't talk to me about Isabel , but I know he 's devoted to her . His face is rather sullen in repose and his eyes are harassed , but when he looks at Isabel such a gentle , kind look comes into them , it 's rather moving . I have a notion that all through their trouble she stood by him like a rock and he never forgets how much he owes her . You 'll find Isabel changed . " I did n't tell him she was beautiful as she had never been before . I was n't sure he had the discernment to see how the pretty , strapping girl had made herself into the wonderfully graceful , delicate and exquisite woman . There are men who are affronted by the aids that art can supply to feminine nature . " She 's very good to Gray . She 's taking infinite pains to restore his confidence in himself . " But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come along the boulevard and dine with me . " No , I do n't think I will , thanks , " he answered . " I must be off . " He got up , nodded in a friendly way , and stepped out onto the pavement. ( iv ) I saw Gray and Isabel next day and told them that I had seen Larry . They were as surprised as I had been . " It 'll be wonderful to see him , " said Isabel . " Let 's call him up at once . " Then I remembered that I had n't thought of asking him where he was staying . Isabel gave me hell . " I 'm not sure he 'd have told me if I had , " I protested , laughing . " Proba-Itobly my subconscious had something to do with it . Do n't you remember , he never liked telling people where he lived . It was one of his oddities . i le may walk in at any moment . " " That would be like him , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never count on his being where you expected him to be . He was here todayand gone tomorrow . You 'd see him in a room and think in a moment you 'd go and say hello to him and when you turned round he 'd disap-peared . " " He always was the most exasperating fellow , " said Isabel . " It 's no good denying that . I suppose we shall just have to wait till it suits him to turn up . He did n't come that day , nor the next , nor the day after . Isabel accused me of having invented the story to annoy . I promised her I had n't and sought to give her reasons why he had n't shown up . But they were implausible . Within myself I wondered whether on thinking it over he had n't made up his mind that he just did n't want to see Gray and Isabel and had wandered off somewhere or other away from Paris . I had a feeling already that he never took root anywhere , but was always prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed good to him or on a whim , to move on . He came at last . It was a rainy day and Gray had n't gone to Mortefontaine . The three of us were together , Isabel and I drinking a cup of tea , Gray sipping a whiskey and Perrier , when the butler opened the door and Larry strolled in . Isabel with a cry sprang to her feet and throwing herself into his arms kissed him on both cheeks . Gray , his fat red face redder than ever , warmly wrung his hand . " Gee , I 'm glad to see you , Larry , " he said , his voice choked with emotion . Isabel bit her lip and I saw she was constraining herself not to cry . " Have a drink , old man , " said Gray unsteadily . I was touched by their delight at seeing the wanderer . It must have been pleasant for him to perceive how much he meant to them . He smiled happily . It was plain to me that he was , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll have a cup of tea , " he said . " Oh gosh , you do n't want tea , " cried Gray . " Let 's have a bottle of chanr pagne . " I 'd prefer tea , " smiled Larry . His composure had on the others the effect he may have intended . They calmed down , but looked at him still with fond eyes . I do n't mean to suggest that he responded to their natural exuberance with an ungracious coldness ; on the contrary , he was as cordial and charming as one could wish ; but I was conscious in his manner of something that I could only describe as remoteness and I wondered what it signified . " Why did n't you come and see us at once , you horror ? " cried Isabel , with a pretence of indignation . " I 've been hanging out of the window for the last five days to see you coming and every time the bell rang my heart leapt to my mouth and I had all I could do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. told me I looked so tough that your man would never let me through the door . I flew over to London to get some clothes . " " You need n't have done that , " I smiled . " You could have got a reach-medownat the Printemps or the Belle Jardiniere . " " I thought if I was going to do it at all , I 'd better do the thing in style . I have n't bought any European clothes for ten years . I went to your tailor and said I wanted a suit in three days . He said it would take a fortnight , so we compromised on four . I got back from London an hour ago . " He wore a blue serge that nicely fitted his slim figure , a white shirt with a soft collar , a blue silk tie and brown shoes . He had had his hair cut short and shaved off the hair on his face . He looked not only neat , but wellgroomed . It was a transformation . He was very thin ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes in the deep sockets larger than I remembered them ; but notwithstanding he looked very well ; he looked , indeed , with his deeply sunburnt , unlined face , amazingly young . He was a year younger than Gray , they were both in their early thirties , but whereas Gray looked ten years more than his age , Larry looked ten years less . Gray 's movements , owing to his great bulk , were deliberate and rather heavy ; but Larry 's were light and easy . His manner was boyish , gay and debonair , but withal it had a serenity that I was peculiarly conscious of and that I did not recollect in the lad I had known before . And as the conversation proceeded , flowing without difficulty as was natural in old friends with so many common memories , with bits of news about Chicago thrown in by Gray and Isabel , trivial gossip , one thing leading to another , with airy laughter , my impression persisted that in Larry , though his laughter was frank and he listened with evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very singular detachment . I did not feel that he was playing a part , he was too natural for that and his sincerity was obvious ; I felt that there was something within him , I do n't know whether to call it an awareness or a sensibility or a force , that remained strangely aloof . The children were brought in , made known to Larry and gave him their polite little knicks . He held out his hand , looking at them with an engagingtenderness in his soft eyes , and they took it , staring at him gravely . Isabel brightly told him they were getting on nicely with their lessons , gave them a cookie each and sent them away . " I 'll come and read to you for ten minutes when you 're in bed . " She did not at that moment want to be interrupted in her pleasure atseeing Larry . The Iittle girls went up to say good night to their father . It was charming to see the love that lit up the red face of that gross man as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one could help seeing that he proudly adored them and when they were gone he turned to Larry and with a sweet slow smile on his lips said : " They 're not bad kids , are they ? " Isabel gave him an affectionate glance . " If I let Gray have his way he 'd spoil them to death . He 'd let me starve to death , that great brute , to feed the children on caviar and pate de foiegras . " He looked at her with a smile and said : " You 're a liar and you know it . I worship the ground you tread on . " There was a responsive smile in Isabel 's eyes . She knew that and was glad of it . A happy couple . She insisted that we should stay to dinner . I , thinking they would prefer to be by themselves , made excuses , but she would not listen to them . " I 'll tell Marie to put another carrot in the soup and there 'll be plenty for four . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legs while Larry and I eat the wings , and she can make the souffle large enough for all of us . " Gray too seemed to want me to stay , so I let myself be persuaded to do what I wanted to . While we waited Isabel told Larry at length what I had already told him in brief . Though she narrated the lamentable story as gaily as possible Gray 's face assumed an expression of sullen melancholy . She tried to cheer him up . " Anyhow it 's all over now . We 've fallen on our feet and we 've got the future before us . As soon as things improve , Gray 's going to get a splendid job and make millions . " Cocktails were brought in and a couple did something to raise the poor fellow 's spirits . I saw that Larry , though he took one , scarcely touched it , and when Gray , unobservant , offered him another he refused . We washed our hands and sat down to dinner . Gray had ordered a bottle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's glass he told him he did n't want any . " Oh , but you must have some , " cried Isabel . " It 's Uncle Elliott 's best and he only gives it to very special guests . " " To tell you the truth I prefer water . After having been in the East so long it 's a treat to drink water that 's safe . " " This is an occasion . " " All right , I 'll drink a glass . " The dinner was excellent , but Isabel noticed , as I did too , that Larry ate very little . It struck her , I suppose , that she had been doing all theI16talking and that Larry had had no chance to do more than listen , so now she began to question him on his actions during the ten years since she had seen him . He answered with his cordial frankness , but so vaguely as not to tell us much . " Oh , I 've been loafing around , you know . I spent a year in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knocked about the East for a bit . " " Where have you just come from now ? " " India . " " How long were you there ? " " Five years . " " Did you have fun ? " asked Gray . " Shoot any tigers ? " " No , " Larry smiled . " What on earth were you doing with yourself in India for five years ? " . aid Isabel . " Playing about , " he answered , with a smile of kindly mockery . " What about the Rope Trick ? " asked Gray . " Did you see that ? " " No , I did n't . " " What did you sec ? " " A lot . " I put a question to him then . " Is it true that the Yogis acquire powers that would seem to us super- natural ? " " I would n't know . All I can tell you is that it 's commonly believed in India . But the wisest do n't attach any importance to powers of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress . I remember one of them telling me of a Yogi who came to the bank of a river ; he had n't the money to pay the ferryman to take him across and the ferryman refused to take him for nothing , so he stepped on the water and walked upon its surface to the other side . The Yogi who told me shrugged his shoulders rather scornfully . A miracle like that , ' he said , is worth no more than the penny it would have cost to go on the ferryboat . ' " " But d' you think the Yogi really walked over the water ? " asked Gray . " The Yogi who told me implicitly believed it . " It was a pleasure to hear Larry talk , because he had a wonderfully melo- dious voice ; it was light , rich without being deep , and with a singular variety of tone . We finished dinner and went back to the drawing-room to have our coffee . I had never been to India and was eager to hear more of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinkers ? " I asked . " I notice that you make a distinction between the two , " said Isabel to tease me. 118 " I made it my business to , " Larry answered . " How did you communicate with them ? In English ? " " The most interesting , if they spoke at all , did n't speak it very well and understood less . I learnt Hindustani . And when I went south I picked up enough Tamil to get along pretty well . " " How many languages d' you know now , Larry ? " " Oh , I do n't know . Half a dozen or so . " " I want to know more about the Yogis , " said Isabel . " Did you get to know any of them intimately ? " " As intimately as you can know persons who pass the best part of their time in the Infinite , " he smiled . " I spent two years in the Ashrama of one . " " Two years ? What 's an Ashrama ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are holy men who live alone , in a temple , in the forest or on the slopes of the Himalayas . There are others who attract disciples . A charitable person to acquire merit builds a room , large or small , for a Yogi whose piety has impressed him to live in , and the disciples live with him , sleeping on the veranda or in the cookhouse if there is one or under the trees . I had a tiny hut in the compound just big enough for my camp bed , a chair and a table , and a bookshelf . " " Where was this ? " I inquired . " In Travancore , a beautiful country of green hills and valleys and soft flowing rivers . Up in the mountains there are tigers , leopards , elephants and bison , but the Ashrama was on a lagoon and all around it grew coconutsand areca palms . It was three or four miles from the nearest town , but people used to come from there , and even from much further , on foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he was inclined to , or just to sit at his feet and share with one another the peace and blessedness that was irradiated from his presence as its fragrance is wafted upon the air by the tuberose . " Gray moved uneasily in his chair . I guessed that the conversation was taking a turn that he found uncomfortable . " Have a drink ? " he said to me . " No , thanks . " " Well , I 'm going to have one . What about you , Isabel ? " He raised his great weight from the chair and went over to the table on which stood whiskey and Perrier and glasses . " Were there other white men there ? " " No . I was the only one . " " How could you stand it for two years ? " cried Isabel . " They passed like a flash . I 've spent days that seemed to be unconscion ably longer . "                    @
