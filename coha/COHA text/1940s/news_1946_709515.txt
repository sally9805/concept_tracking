Burin will take place in the Arlington ( Va . ) National Cemetery on Wednesday . The man who founded the first successful tabloid in this country , and guided it until it had achieved the largest circulation of any newspaper in the United States , had previously been an ardent social reformer  --  at one time labeling himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first World War ; but his national reputation rested almost entirely on the newspaper he created . He was the eldest member of a publishing triumvirate whose bitter opposition to the foreign policies of President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the second World War provoked violent controversy . His sister , publisher of The Washington Times-Herald ; his cousin , Col. Robert R. McCormick , publisher of The Chicago Tribune , and Captain Patterson all fought the President 's policies tooth and nail . Unchanged in His Views Despite the flood of condemnation which some of the news stories and editorials of his newspaper brought down upon him , Captain Patterson remained unchanged in his views to his death . He continued to confer almost daily with his editorial writers and chief news executives as long as his health permitted , and fought with all the vigor at his command for the ultra-nationalistic policies in which he believed . On its editorial page this morning The Daily News says in heavy black type : " Joseph Medill Patterson , publisher of this newspaper and the man who directed this page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1919 , is no longer with us . The story of his death will be found in the news columns . " Those who are left behind will do their best to keep this page and the paper what we believe he would , want them to be . " Captain Patterson leaves a widleaves three daughters by an earlier marriage , Mrs. Donald W. Baker , Mrs. Harry Guggenheim and Mrs. Josephine Patterson Reeve , and a son , James , who is a West Point graduate and a first lieutenant of infantry . Attended Groton and Yale Born in Chicago on Jan. 6 , 1879 , Captain Patterson was the son of Robert W. Patterson , general manager of The Chicago Tribune . His mother was the former Elinor Medi11 , daughter of Joseph Medill , founder of The Tribune . He was educated at Groton and Yale , interrupting his academic career at the latter institution long enough to go China as a war correspondent and cover the Boxer rebellion in 1900 . He returned to Yale , however , and was graduated in 1901 . He joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduation at a salary of $15 a week , which was not particularly important , in view of the fact that he received an allowance of more than $10,000 a year from his family . He disliked the conservative stand of The Tribune on public questions , and became an ardent advocate of various reform measures . At the age of 24 he was elected as a reform candidate to the Illinois State Legislature where , during a debate on municipal ownership of street car lines , he started a demonstration in which books and inkstands were hurled and the Speaker of the House sought safety in the cloakroom . Opposed Tribune Candidate Two years later he stumped Chicago for a Democratic Mayoralty candidate whom The Tribune was opposing and when the Democratic ticket won Mr. Patterson was made Commissioner of Public Works . He resigned from the city administration the next year after announcing himself a convert to Socialism and declaring that ? real reform was impossible under the capitalistic system . Two years after that he wrote a novel , " A Little Brother of the Rich , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social set as excessive drinkers and vulgar exhibitionists . It created a furore in Chicago . From these sorties into government and sensationalism Mr. Patterson returned to the fold of the family 's newspaper when his father died in 1910 . He shared control of The Tribune with his cousin , Robert R. McCormick . When the first World War began Mr. Patterson became one of The Tribune 's war correspondents . He gained recognition for his impartial accounts of alleged atrocities in Belgium and northern France . After returning to this country in 1916 when trouble was brewing with Mexico Mr. Patterson went to the border as a private in the Illinois Field Artillery . He returned a sergeant . When the United States entered the first World War the next year he went overseas as a second lieutenant , served in five major engagements , in one of which he was gassed and slightly wounded , and won a captaincy and the nickname " Aunty Joe , " which his men affectionately bestowed on him . How News Was Born Captain Patterson commanded Battery B of the 149th Field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Marne and the final drive through the Argonne . He went to London to visit Lord Northcliffe , a family friend , whose London Daily Mirror was selling 800,000 copies daily . Lord Northcliffe suggested to the captain that he start in some . American city a tabloid paper bright and simple enough to entice the masses . Captain Patterson went home to Chicago , rushed a journalistic crew to New York , and The Daily News was born . Although the captain had sired it and guided it through a faltering infancy before it became an important property , it was not until 1925 that he quit Chicago and left the administration of The Tribune interests to his cousin , Colonel McCormick . Cramming the tabloid with pictures , comic strips , stories of sex , crime and cash prizes in beauty and limerick contests , the captain soon won for his new paper an immense circulation , including many persons who had never before read newspapers regularly . Explained Change in Paper In later years , when the lurid fires of tabloid journalism had burned . somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Captain Patterson explained the change thus : " The Daily News was built on legs , but when we got enough circulation we draped them . " The political unorthodoxy of Captain Patterson 's early years was as a noonday breeze compared ow , the former Mary King , woto 3 tempests set in motion by men 's editor of The News , whom he married on July 5 , 1938 . He also the use of his widely read edito rial pages in recent years . In the early days of the New Deal a strong supporter of the late President Franklin D. Roosevelt , Captain Patterson subsequently turned against the President and his policies . In editorials and cartoons shaped to Captain Patterson 's views , the President was denounced as a " warmonger . " The President 's supporters , on the other hand , opposed the captain as an " isolationist , " and , after we entered the second World War , referred to Captain Patterson and his cousin , the colonel , as " the McCormick-Patterson axis . " Personality Stamped on News Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News firmly in his own hands . His personality was stamped on the paper 's news and editorial content . His contacts with the business office were less extensive than with the news end of the business , but there , too , he made all the major decisions . It was his practice , on a typical day , to visit the various news and feature departments . His first stop was usually the Sunday department , where he often suggested pictures or stories to be featured . Then he would stop at the city desk , where he would discuss the day 's news and order the development of certain stories which interested him . Often reporters were assigned to do extensive research on themes that particularly interested him , and he closely supervised their work . He took a similar interest in news-picture coverage . It was as the result of an order he issued that The Daily News obtained and printed the most controversial picture it ever published  --  that showing Mrs. Ruth Snyder dying in the electric chair in Sing Sing Prison in 1928 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Daily News was sharply condemned for publishing it , but Captain Patterson stood by the decision to use it . Known for Terse Editorials Captain Patterson 's views were most clearly conveyed to the general public through the terse , colloquial editorials of The Daily News . He took a keen interest in their preparation , daily meeting with Reuben Maury , editorial writer , and C. D. Batchelor , cartoonist , to outline the ideas he wanted advanced . He also took a close , active interest in the comic strips printed in The News , and often suggested new themes to the artists who drew them . He always prided himself on his understanding of " the man in the street . " When he came to New York he made the Bowery his favorite slumming ground . He was not just an onlooker , but lived among the down-and-outers , ate and drank with them and panhandled coins . Captain Patterson was the author of two novels and three plays , all written between 1907 and 1914 . In addition to the sensational " A Little Brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled " Rebellion . " Both of these were later dramatized and presented on Broadway , as was a play , " The Fourth Estate , " which he wrote in collaboration with James Keeley and Harriet Ford . An aviation enthusiast , Captain Patterson , when he had passed the age of 40 , learned to fly his own plane . Even a crash landing failed to deter him , and he made a tour of the West Indies in his private plane . Later he flew to San Francisco during the longshoremen 's strike in 1934 . Just before the outbreak of the war in Europe in 1939 he toured that continent and filed stories of his observations to The News . He and Colonel McCormick jointly founded Liberty Magazine , which they sold in 1931 to Bernarr Macfadden . In return they took over Macfadden 's Detroit newspaper , which they renamed The Mirror . It ceased publication , however , on Aug. 5 , 1932 . Captain Patterson married Miss Alice Higginbotham of Chicago in 1902 , the ygar after - his graduation from ' rale .
