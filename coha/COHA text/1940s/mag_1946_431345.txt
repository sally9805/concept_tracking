 | My wife and I have been married four years . During that time we never have consulted a psychiatrist , a marital clinic , or Dorothy Dix . Until recently we thought we had achieved a perfect marriage . We had weathered such crises as Army life , illness , unemployment , and we were more in love than ever . We were proud and grateful for our happiness . Now we 're not so sure . People come along and warn us that our so-called perfect marriage is n't perfect at all ; that , if anything , it shimmers perilously on the brink of the precipice of disaster ; that something quite definite is wrong with both of us and we 'd better visit a psychiatrist at once and lay our neuroses on the table . They send us books , pamphlets , magazines , and underlined newspaper clippings in which marriage authorities advise us that it 's normal to quarrel , nag , fight , have sex problems , and engage in a little adultery now and then . These , we are told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without them , marriage is stupid and dull . Frankly speaking , this contention has us worried sick . After all , how would you feel if you were convinced you were blissfully happy and then were presented with a mass of literary evidence proving you were n't ? For example , a book is published under the title Be Glad You 're Neurotic . We 're glad we 're not . I guess that makes us a little queer . The Reader 's Digest runs an article titled @#  | " Have a Good Marital Quarrel . " We 'd just as soon do without one , but I guess that makes us freakish . Another periodical offers an essay by A. P. Herbert , who says : " To me , the conception of two people living together for twentyfive years without having a cross word suggests a lack of spirit to be admired in sheep . " Okay , Mr. Herbert . Admire us ! My wife and I would rather be sheep . The New York Times quotes the Archbishop of York on the subject of adultery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain and temptation with the person committing the sin never really losing love for wife or husband . " My wife and I are old-fashioned . We mean no disrespect to the Archbishop , but we 'd prefer leaving adultery out of our marriage altogether , excuses or no . A book entitled When You Marry advises that " an open quarrel , especially in its third stage ( the peacemaking period ) , brings release of tension and a glorious feeling . " The spouse and I would rather release our tension and obtain that glorious feeling through other methods . Now , I know full well that this places us in the position of swimming headlong  | against the current tide of marital advice , and that 's why I 'm genuinely disturbed . My . wife and I wonder : have we been deluding ourselves these four years ? Has our marriage been as full and as rich as we claim ? How could it be , without quarrels , naggings , tantrums , fights , separations , adultery , and oh ! yes , those allimportant sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor who teaches sociology visited us . He 's achieved a good deal of publicity by conducting a class in marriage and sex education ; you know , the kind in which girls ask if petting is harmful and long engagements are desirable . Well , this professor called on us , so he said , because our friends had recommended us as a perfectly mated couple . Would we answer a few questions ? Modestly we said yes ? anything to help the state of the union . " Tell me , " he said , " what marital problems do you have ? " " None worthy of the name , " I said . " None ? " he repeated in surprise . " None , " I said . " That 's impossible , " he insisted . " Every normal couple has marital problems . Maybe you do n't now , but surely you did during your adjustment period ? " " Not us , " I said . The authority smiled . " Let 's be serious , " he suggested . " Right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950 , we expect that two out of every three wartime marriages will have ended in divorce . If you 've discovered a formula for successful marriage , we 'd surely like to have it . " ALL right , " I agreed . " I 'll be serious . But my original answer still holds . We have no marital difficulties or disputes worthy of the name . Maybe we 're ' not normal . I do n't know about that . But I do know that the reason for our success has been our approach to marriage . We never expected that any portion of it would be bad , boring , disillusioning , or that we had to reconcile ourselves to any of its evils . We expect it to get better all the time , and it does . " The professor shook his head . " I do n't exactly follow you . " " It 's pretty simple , " I explained . " Two persons get married . What sort of advice are they given ? Usually a series of warnings : Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't expect your husband 's love-making to be as ardent five years from now . Men like to play around . Nagging is an integral part of marriage . It takes years to attain a satisfying sexual adjustment . You 're really tied down now . If your wife leaves you once in a while , take it in stride ; that 's normal . Many women are extravagant . That 's part of the game . You ca n't expect love to last forever . Marriage is 90 percent monotony . ' " Newlyweds are counseled to expect and adapt themselves to the worst aspects of marriage . They 're not told how to avoid these pitfalls , as they are supposed to be common to all matrimony . My wife and I always have thought this was the bunk . It 's better , we feel , to advise a bride : Never nag . You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar , ' than it is to tell a husband that nagging is part and parcel of a woman 's way and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that grooms should be lectured on the art of being thoughtful rather than brides ' being cautioned that most men are thoughtless beasts .  | " The trouble with most married people , " I went on , " is that they honestly expect to be miserable a good portion of their married lives . " " Maybe so , " the authority said . I could see he was unconvinced . The solution was too simple . There was more to a successful marriage than expecting all of it to be a success and then working at it . There was Freud , frigidity , KrafftEbing , inferiority complexes , and of course , the other woman . No , our solution was too pat . We were n't normal . We were happy . The professor shifted his conversational gears . " I understand , " he said , " that you two never quarrel . " He looked at us squintingly , as if we were specimens under a microscope . ' That 's not particularly healthy , you know . " " No , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , yes , " he reassured us . " Quarreling is a necessary constituent of every marriage . Quarrels not only relieve boredom and tension but make both partners feel good after the bout is settled . " THIS is a popular theory about marital quarrels , and we were extremely sorry to differ with the authority . " We think , " my wife said , " that quarrels spoil a marriage and help ruin it . We have differences and we argue , but we never quarrel . We never dispute anything angrily . We always retain our sense of humor . We 're considerate of each other . I know that , according to the books , that 's wrong , but we are , nevertheless . " " What do you mean , according to the books ' ? " the professor asked . " Well , " my wife said , " the marriage books say that a husband is considerate to his business associates all day long and that when he gets home at night he ought be able to ease up and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If a man can be considerate to the people he works with , surely he can afford the same privilege to the woman he loves and lives with . We 've found that a smile by any one member of a duo always will prevent a quarrel . " The professor furrowed his brow . " Does that system really work ? " he asked . " It works with us , " my wife said . " We 're very happy . " The professor reached for his hat . " You only think you 're happy , " he said . " After listening to both of you , I 'm convinced that you 're suffering from what we call the romantic fallacy . You believe you have a happy marriage because you do n't quarrel , have no sex problems , adultery never tempts you , and you love each other more than ever . Well , my friends , there 's something very radically wrong with your marriage . It has n't had enough ups and downs . You have n't sown enough discord . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same emotional level . You ca n't really enjoy the good in your partnership because you 've never tasted the bad . It 's also quite apparent that you 're both abnormally normal . " And with that little statement , the professor bowed his way out . My wife and I have been thinking over what the old boy said , and we do n't know what to do . That 's our dilemma . As I said at the beginning , we thought we had a happy marriage , but now ? what with all those books , magazines , and words of advice from friends and authorities ? we have our doubts . But we hope they wo n't materialize.
