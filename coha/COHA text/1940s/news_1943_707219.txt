txt FUNDS OF 5 BILLION STILL DEADLOCKED IN CONGRESS JAM Checks to Employes of WPB , OWI and Other Units Short as Legislation Fails to Pass SENATE RESTRICTS NLRB Reverses Itself to Curb Action on Kaiser Labor Row  --  Fate of NYA Is Up Today By C. P. TRUSSELL Special to TEE NEW YORE TIMES . WASHINGTON , July 2 ? More than $5,000,000,000 of operating appropriations for the new fiscal year remained tied up tonight in House and Senate deadlocks after another day of struggling for final agreements . First pinches were felt along payroll fronts . Checks to employes of the War Production Board , the Office of War Information , the Lend-Lease Administration and other units fell short of the full half-month sums while the new funds awaited Congressional approval . Unless stalemates were broken soon , it was asserted , similar cutbacks would spread through a score of war agencies and into the old-line offices of the Agriculture , Interior and Labor Departments . The day was one of intense activity , which brought some new deadlocks along with closer approaches to harmony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the question of National Labor Relations Board intervention in the jurisdictional fights between the Congress of Industrial Organizations and the American Federation of Labor for closed-shop representation in the Kaiser and other shipbuilding yards , the Senate voted , in effect , to order the board to keep hands off and not call an election which might shift control from the AFL to the Warning Given by Wagner This action was taken in the face of a declaration by Senator Robert F. Wagner , Democrat , of New York , that it would " close up " the National Labor Relations Act , of which he is the author , so far as it concerned the open or closed shop issue for at least a year . The vote was 40 to 25 . The Senate , which on the first test had voted 69 to 0 against a House amendment to the $143,000 , - 000 Urgent Deficiency Bill which would have cut three Government employes off Federal payrolls for alleged association with " subversive " organizations or movements , voted today , 48 to 42 , to require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Nov. 15 , next , to keep their jobs . It was not certain tonight that the House , which has insisted with four votes upon carrying out its prohibitions against Robert Morss Lovett , Goodwin B. Watson and William E. Dodd Jr. , would accept this compromise . A vote was scheduled for tomorrow . Brown Protests Over Action Meanwhile , it was pointed out , authority for the President to continue to use his $86,000,000 special emergency fund had expired and about $121,000,000 of straight and overtime pay for Government employes awaited final action . With the $3,000,000,000 War Agencies Supply Bill still to be completed , declarations came from the Office of Price Administration that some of its provisions as // FUNDS OF 5 BILLION STILL DEADLOCKED // agreed to by both House and Senate , its reductions of operating funds and prohibitions supposedly harmonized in conference , would " destroy price control . " Particular exception was taken by Prentiss M. Brown , Price Administrator , to an amendment which both House and Senate adopted which would prohibit the use of funds for the promulgation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This would " break down " the OPA 's dollars-and-cents ceilings on meat " and many other articles , " Mr. Brown maintained . It would " not be possible , " he told Senate leaders , to enforce " scores " of ceilings " now accepted by the trade and customers . " Other OPA officials asserted that the ban against grade labeling and standardization also would cripple price controls on iron and steel scrap metal , nonferrous metal scrap , lumber and agricultural containers . The conference-proposed reduction of the appropriation for OPA to $130,000,000 from the $185,000 , - 000 it planned to use , Mr. Brown stated , could cut the agency 's funds below the rate at which it was now operating and preclude the employment of additional officers . Thus , he held , the enforcement program would " break down . " An amendment requiring price officials to have had previous business experience in each commodity upon which they worked , Mr. Brown stated , would in itself " destroy " price control . Fate of NYA Comes to Fore These issues may come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reached , however , the fate of the long-disputed National Youth Administration may be decided . The House voted originally to liquidate the NYA , giving it $3,000,000 with which to close down by Jan. 1 next . The Senate voted to continue the former relief agency as a " war " organization to train workers , and allowed $47,800,000 for this fiscal year . The House ' refused to yield , and insisted that the NYA must go . In return today the Senate disagreed with the House over the requiring of employes of the War Manpower Commission who get $4,500 a year or more to be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate . Whereas the House , by a vote of 192 to 22 , killed the requirement as contained in the $1,146,000,000 Labor Department-Federal Security Agency bill , the Senate voted today , 37 to 19 , to restore it . Thus , the bill must again return to conference despite agreements on other points . In the War Agency bill a similar requirement would be imposed upon the $4,500-and-over officials and employes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Labor Department-Federal Security bill that the Senate , with members insisting that they sought not to enter the AFL-CIO jurisdictional battle for closed-shop control in shipyards and plants but to prevent a stirring up of election controversies and retardation of war production , voted that : No part of the funds appropriated to the NLRB shall be used in any way in connection with a complaint case arising over an agree . ment between management and labor which has been in existence for three months or longer without complaint being filed . Acts to Balk Secret Plant Pacts To prevent secret contracts from being entered into , however , the conference agreement provided that hereafter notice of management-labor agreements must be posted in the plants affected for a period of three months and be open to inspection by any interested person . The amendment was sponsored by the AFL which obtained closedshop conditions in West Coast Kaiser shipyards when small numbers of workers , which now have Igrown to tens of thousands , were employed . The CIO seeks new elections for collective bargaining representation and closed-shop control . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands-off order to the NLRB appears to be final . The provision would be effective throughout the current fiscal year . The $875,000,000 supply bill for the Department of Agriculture was thrown back into conference for the second time in three days early today when the House again refused to yield to the Senate 's insistence that the Administration 's crop-insurance program be continued . The House thus stood by its original vote to permit the payment only of obligations actually incurred and then a closing down of the insurance experiment . After two days of part-time work on the $127,000,000 Interior Department Appropriation Bill the House had not settled many of the forty-six items on which it was in disagreement with the Senate . It had refused to accept so many of the Western State reclamation projects designed to start a twoyear food production program that the bill was certain to return again to conference .
