" It 's kind of fun to be the underdog-it 's a novelty , " said Don Budge last week . <P> Cocky little Bobby Riggs-who won the pro tennis championship last December after ten years in the long shadow of Don Budge , first as an amateur , then as a pro-thought it even more fun to be top dog . <P> In Chicago they began a 25-match tour with Riggs 's title at stake . Said Bobby : <P> " Budge was the greatest player the world ever saw-up to now . I 'll run Budge down . I 'm probably the fastest player who ever played tennis . I play his forehand : that 's his big weakness . I have no weakness . That 's why I 'm better . This tour is putting a great player with a weakness against a great player with no weakness . " <P> He was sure enough about it to bet about $10,000 on himself . Almost as big a plunger as he is a talker , brash Bobby says he offered to put the tour on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . ( The Budge version : Budge offered to split the profits 70-30 but Bobby preferred 60-40 because he " does n't want to put his money where his mouth is. " ) * " It must be tough for Don , " says Bobby sympathetically , " trying to get back . " <P> Amiable Don Budge , a freckle-faced six-footer , whose strong point on the court is his backhand , expertly backhanded : Bobby is " amusing , acts awfully young for his age 28 and does n't mean half what he says . " Not yet in prewar form , he was still confident : " There 's no doubt about the final outcome of the tour . When I play him , he ca n't control the game at all ; I 'll either win or beat myself . " Usually no self-bettor , Budge had his dander up this time , made a $1,000 side bet with Riggs . Said he : " I 'm betting with Riggs because he 's always talking about betting and I 'd just like to rub his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chicago , ended as both players had expected , with Budge wearing himself out , and losing . Score : 3-6 , 6-3 , 6-4 , 6-8 , 6-3 . <P> <P> * Their last series tour in 1942 ( which Budge won easily ) was played with a $25,000 guarantee for Riggs , and 60% of the gate for Budge . The tour made no money ; Budge collected 60% of nothing . Said Bobby , pocketing his $25,000 check : " Congratulations , Don . "
