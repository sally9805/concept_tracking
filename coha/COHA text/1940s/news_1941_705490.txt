txt In the early hours of Palm Sunday morning , praying God " to lead the German armies on their path , " Adolf Hitler struck at two more small nations that wanted only to live their own lives in peace and freedom . The attack was begun in characteristic German fash- ? ion , with massed air assaults by Stuka bombers on a capital which had previously been declared an open city . It was followed , as all German attacks are followed , by an equally characteristic performance to which the foreign correspondents in Berlin were summoned , in order that they might hear from those in high authority how blameless is the German case , how shamefully the little German Reich had been bullied by big Yugoslavia and giant Greece , how noble the German nation felt , on this Palm Sunday morning , because " its leaders had done everything to bring about a peaceful settlement . " Only in one narrow sense , touching the depths of human cynicism , does this explanation of Germany 's action and this apologia for an attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plainly written on the record that no one can mistake them . Doubtless Hitler would have preferred to have Yugoslavia and Greece surrender abjectly and become creatures of his will , rather than be forced to the effort of imposing his will upon them . He did not want to fight in the Balkans unless he had to . If Yugoslavia and Greece had surrendered , he would willingly have spared their people . After all , he had a use for them . He wanted slaves . Every step he took in the Balkans , from the seizure of Austria to the negotiations with Regent Paul of Yugoslavia , was intended to avoid a waste of his own strength . He preferred conquest by corruption , by treachery , by the methods of the spy and the assassin , to conquest under arms . He liked to take little countries piecemeal  --  Austria , which weakened the Czech flank ; Hungary , which exposed Rumania ; Rumania , which left Bulgaria vulnerable . He had so little doubt that Yugoslavia itself would fall in the same fashion that he sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantities of arms . He despised Mussolini , but counted on Mussolini to hem in the Serbs if they proved obstinate . He wanted every one in the Balkans to listen to reason  --  his kind of reason . Many people did , some because they were hypnotized , some because they were frightened , some , perhaps , just because they were tired . In Yugoslavia he has now encountered a people who are not hypnotized , not tired and certainly not frightened . He has a war there which he tried to avoid . He may believe that he can win it , but still he did not care for it . It will cost him men , ammunition , equipment , gasoline  --  all of which are precious to him . To have to fight that war at all is for him a defeat . No one can safely predict how far or how fast he will go when he reaches the rugged country where the Yugoslays intend to make their fight . What is sure is that when he was compelled       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
