No one really expected Painter Henri Matisse to bother to answer the attack that British Royal Academy President Sir Alfred Munnings had made on his work ( TIME , May 9 ) . But last week Matisse did . Sitting up in bed in his suburban apartment at Nice to talk to a TIME correspondent , the 79-year-old master gently contradicted Horse-Painter Munnings ' views on modern art in general . <P> " If you want to paint a tree , " gruff Sir Alfred had snorted at a recent R.A. banquet , " for heaven 's sake make it look like a tree ! " Matisse 's La Fort ( in London 's Tate Gallery ) did not look a bit like trees to Sir Alfred . Argued Matisse , why should it ? Such " material truth , " he said , might as well be left to photography . The truth modern painters like himself are after is something else again ; it " comes out of the mind of the artist . . . the sentiment of an artist moved by the spectacle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paintings , " Matisse went on . " First there is the kind that introduces something new . Such paintings begin by being worthless but eventually they ascend the heights of value . Then there are those which are accepted at the outset because they offer nothing new but simply flatter the public taste . They are later found to be worthless . " <P> The story of Matisse 's own career clearly made him an example of the first kind of painter . Could he think of an opposite example ? " Charity commands me , " said Matisse with a smile , " not to name any artists who do paintings of the second sort . "
