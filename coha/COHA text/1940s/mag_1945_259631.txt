( See Cover ) <P> The sweep of events in 1945 engulfed a whole era . The modern Dark Ages gave way to a period in which man had another of his historically rare and fragile chances to seek peace and ensue it . The Axis , an insane Atlantis which no Francis Bacon would ever mourn , was shattered and submerged . <P> The men who had made that era vanished with it . Benito Mussolini , Italy 's self-styled Man of Destiny , died ignominiously and was hung by his heels like a slaughtered pig alongside the body of his mistress . Adolf Hitler , Man of 1938 , died by his own hand , also with his mistress , in the rubble of Berlin . Or did he die ? Dead or alive , it did not much matter ; Adolf Hitler , the force , had perished . <P> More obliterating than death was the continued life of Hideki Tojo . But for the Battle of Midway , he would certainly have been the Man of 1942 . His war had been the coldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrogant , his nation 's defeat the most ruinous . When he tried to commit suicide he failed again ; at year 's end he lived on , saved from death by U.S. blood , shunned by his countrymen , still able to read that U.S. strategists had decoded his every intention , that he had never really had a chance . <P> Death &; the Ballot Box . Even among the victors , men 's fortunes rose &; ebbed rapidly in the quick shift of the tides . <P> Franklin Roosevelt , Man of 1932 , 1934 and 1941 , was dead , struck down with dramatic suddenness before he could witness the victory he had charted and planned . Had he lived , 1945 would have been his year-the final flowering of American hope and strength which he had nurtured through black days made blacker by American indecision . But now he lay in a grave at Hyde Park , mourned by the world . <P> Winston Churchill , Man of 1940 , had somehow missed the flood . He had led his country to victory , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster , suffered a humiliating political defeat . <P> To Chiang Kaishek , China 's Man of Eight Years , the events of 1945 came as a reward for unwavering courage and patience . Of all the Allies , China had endured the most . But the long-awaited , almost-despaired-of peace found Chiang embroiled in something close to civil war . He might well be the Man of 1946 , or of some later year ; he was not the Man of 1945 . <P> Victory &; Ravishment . Of all the world leaders of the ' 30s and early ' 40s , the most solidly successful survivor was Joseph Stalin . Yet Stalin 's success was far from complete . His own country , though victorious , was ravished . His world revolution ( if he still sought one ) was still a distant goal . War 's end did not bring Communism to the world or even to much of Europe . <P> As the talk between the world and his wife showed , Joseph Stalin was the most feared man of 1945 . By his followers in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not dominate the year . And he ended it amidst rumors of ill health , amidst mounting speculation whether his successor would be Diplomat Molotov or Soldier Zhukov.
