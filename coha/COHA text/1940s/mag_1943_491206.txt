Ungovernable Governor THE only trouble with Charlie Edison , " a friend recently said of the Democratic governor of New Jersey , " is that he is a man of unswerving principle , and there is such a thing as carrying a principle too far . I mean there are times when it would be smart for him to swerve a little , but be just wo n't be practical . " This is a fair description of Charles Edison 's approach to a task he has sworn himself to  --  that of saving the speckled soul of his native state , within whose boundaries Boss Frank Hague has raised " practical politics " to the rarefied level of caricature . Nowhere else , not even in the low-comedy atmosphere of New York 's old Tammany , has the democratic process been so baldly stultified , and Edison 's anger over this civic indignity is cold , hard and enduring . His battle for Jersey 's salvation has so far been discouragingly indecisive . It is not yet clear whether the end of his three-year term , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or whether the triennium will limp into history as a footnote captioned " Edison 's Rebellion . " Hague lost a round in November when United States Sen. William H. Smathers , a Hague darling , failed of re-election , and this defeat stemmed , in part , from Edison 's refusal to utter a word in behalf of Smathers ' candidacy . Hague conceded another round ten days after the election fiasco when he publicly admitted that Jersey City , of which he has been mayor steadily since 1917 , faced bankruptcy . He was driven to this admission by the activities of a new Edison tax commission which has been busy reducing swollen assessments in Hague 's domain , and thus the governor can take credit for setting up the pay-off punch . But the real blow in this instance was self-inflicted ; through a confiscatory tax policy and padding of public pay rolls over the years , Hague has made financial reorganization inevitable . However , Hague is still the big power in Jersey , despite his recent reverses , and Edison continues to get letters from well-wishers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mickey Rooney and Spencer Tracy . " I am confident that you , who gave humanity the electric light , will be equal to the job of bringing back decent government , " is a sample of the way the letters begin . This keeps Edison from getting the idea that he has replaced Hague as the political symbol of the state . But Edison , who is the first governor since Woodrow Wilson to tilt a reformer 's lance , has actually made encouraging gains against the common enemy . Hague at first viewed the Edison administration much as a colonial governor might have looked upon an uprising by a sub-branch of the Pequots . When Edison , as his first official act , yanked from the governor 's office the private wire over which Hague had been running the state from Jersey City , Hague took it as a typical hypocritical gesture of the kind to which he had long been accustomed . His expression was baleful , but even in a good mood he looks like a man who has bitten hard into life and hit his tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been kept on the defensive , and it is the first time this has happened since he launched his era of gaudy misrule a quarter century ago . Hague has been forced to conduct what the military commentators call a defense in depth , sowing political land mines as he retreats and fighting a delaying action from both flanks . His strategy is based soundly upon the brevity of a Jersey governor 's term and a constitutional taboo against consecutive terms . He is trying to sit Edison out . The duel is a classic laboratory example of the basic American conflict between machine rule and rule by the ordinary people . Edison , preaching a high standard of political morality , pitches his appeal direct to the unorganized voters of both parties . He educates , he castigates the pose that it is useless to bother about voting and he stumps the state exhorting the citizenry to toss out the politics-forprofit crowd . He consorts openly with Republicans and in making appointments ignores party lines and chooses men for their ability and honesty . At times good friends have urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic local leaders who would desert Hague in exchange for a plum or two . But that would he swerving . Hague remains , as he has always been , contemptuous of political morality and public intelligence . Dry-Cleaning Jersey Justice S TUDENTS of the Hague method usually study his acts , not his words , which are apt to be garbled , but on one occasion , which is described in detail here for the first .. 11 le , he handed down a clear oral thesis to fellow serious thinkers in the field of civil government . His immediate audience was Governor Edison , and the thesis consisted of a bawling out lasting one hour . It was delivered over the long-distance telephone in January , 1941 , when Haguewas in Miami taking the waters and Edison had been governor about a week . Had it happened in a movie , the discerning cinema patron would have lifted a skeptical eyebrow and remarked that such things did n't happen in real life . The spark which set off the explosion was unwittingly supplied by Supreme Court Justice Thomas Trenchard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of journalistic emphasis was best known for having presided at the Hauptmann trial . It had long been known that the elderly Trenchard wanted to retire , and Hague pressure had been brought upon him to do it while Gov . A. Harry Moore , Hague 's willing collaborator , was still in Trenton . With plainly deliberate intent , Trenchard clung to his judgeship until Moore was out of office , then turned in his resignation to Edison . Hague was on the wire in Miami at seven o'clock the next morning , rousing from sleep Arthur Walsh , of South Orange , who had managed Edison 's campaign . This call was one of a series of curtain raisers to the main show , but it is worth repeating in substance , for the light it throws upon a state of mind . It was of paramount importance , Hague told Walsh , " to have a man in there whose vote you can get when you want it . " He named the man he thought ought to have Trenchard 's vacated seat , a lawyer who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberately vague , passed off the demand by getting the boss into a discussion of how the horses were running in Florida . For the next few days Walsh was under a continuous telephone assault  --  by Hague in Miami and by his nephew secretary and heir apparent , Frank Hague Eggers , who kept calling from the chambers where Hague presides , outside of racing season , as mayor of Jersey City . Tired of having his sleep interrupted his ear bent , Walsh suggested to Edison that he call Hague himself and tell him flatly who was making judicial appointments in Jersey for the next three years . The governor took the suggestion . He got Hague on the wire and told him that he had really meant what he had said in his inaugural address about rescuing the old phrase " Jersey justice " i.rom the category of a joke and restoring it to one of respect . " Now , mayor , " he went on , " you wo n't like this a bit , but the man I 'm going to appoint to Trenchard 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 in the Bar Association when your boy was made a judge . " This was Frederic R. Colie , a Republican , of Newark . Two years earlier , Colic had loudly protested a callous deal by which Frank Hague , Jr. , a not very distinguished member of the bar , had been elevated to the Court of Errors and Appeals , the highest bench in the state . Hague roared with anguish and trumpeted profanely . " Charlie , " he cried , " you 've turned out tobe just the kind of governor I thought you 'd be , you ? Benedict Arnold ! Do you know what I 'm going to do to  --  you for this ? I 'm going to break you , Charlie , if it 's the last thing I do . And do n't get the idea that Mayor Hague is going to fight you out in the open where you can grab off a lot of fancy publicity . I 'm going to cut you from underneath , in ways you wo n't discover until too late . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a - in grate . " Deflating a Boss AS THE minutes ticked on , with Edison saying little more than uh-huh , Hague 's mood switched back and forth between abuse colored with incredulity and back-room cajolery . At one point he yelled , " I could understand it if a Republican governor did this to me , but a Democrat ! Charlie , have you lost your mind ? " Edison replied that he did n't think so , and Hague cried , " Look , here 's what I want to know : can you count on this in a pinch ? " " I 'll never know that , mayor , " Edison replied , " because I 'll never ask him for a favor . I 'm appointing a judge , not a stooge . " The talk finally wound up on a plaintively cordial note injected by Hague , " You do n't blame a fellow for fighting , do you , Charlie ? " and Edison , who is gentle and slow to anger , reluctantly concluded that the aging boss would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Hague might be induced to go along with a program of reform and rebuilding . Edison 's streak of naivete is a strong one and it was natural for Hague to mistake him in the beginning for a docile , unwary man who could be bulldozed into turning over the keys of the State House . Edison had the usual look of a businessman wandering , bemused , in the wonderland of politics , and he has never quite lost it . It is a diverting paradox that this governor who has struck some of the hardest blows Hague has ever suffered is a mild-mannered man with a devotion to whimsey . Viewed in another way , perhaps it is n't such a paradox , for Hague is the equal of anyone in a forthright public brawl , but , like any other primitive aborigine , is baffled when confronted with a simple , civilized tactic . If Edison would only get down on all fours and pull hair and slash with his teeth , Hague could understand and honor him as an opponent and , in the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawful , orderly way , and Hague is as thunderstruck as a tribal chieftain when faced with as elementary a product of civilization as a seventy-nine-cent alarm clock . First he reacts with a horrified bellow of injury , then he vilifies and vituperates and calls upon his local gods to drive the ( Continued on Page 51 ) enemy from his shores , and when his gods fail him , he retreats and awaits the next assault . He has suffered grievously from attacks of law and order since Edison went to Trenton . If Edison has done nothing else , he has at least raised a question in the minds of the electorate as to whether Hague is as impregnable as he has seemed to be . This is a major step forward , for the inhabitants of Jersey , like the shadowy residents of a political Limehouse , have lived so long in an atmosphere of purse-cutting and thuggery that they might be presumed to have lost all capacity for indignation over public misdeeds . Governor Edison has proved to his own satisfaction that indignation is still latent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a peculiarly dispassionate way . Without personal heat , he pinches Hague between thumb and forefinger as if he were a grasshopper and holds him up to the light . While the victim expels political tobacco juice and fans his wings , Edison calmly asks the voters to note his crude behavior . Then he tells them that their apathy is responsible for Hagueism . Tracing the historical causes of Hague 's rise to power , he asks , in effect , ' ' Are n't you ashamed that you allowed this to happen , and when are you going to get busy and help me to do something about it ? " Edison is a slow but thorough thinker , and he suffers from deafness as a result of a typhoid attack years ago . In conversation he often cups an ear to catch the words of a visitor whose voice lacks carrying power . There is a suspicion among some who have talked with him  --  probably an unjust one  --  that he does this more to stall for time before making reply than to aid his hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it , " The deaf hears only what he wants to hear . " Edison finds , as did his father , that impaired hearing has its compensations ; the greatest of which is the encouragement it gives to concentrated thinking . At Sea Girt , where he occupied the governor 's cottage during his first summer in office , trains of the Jersey Central railroad chugged intermittently out of a station located a hundred yards from the study , causing the house to vibrate . Equally close by was a National Guard target range on which rifles rattled all day long , and sometimes military airplanes roared across the cottage to strafe ground troops with blank machine-gun bullets . Through all the racket , Edison sat at his desk , unbothered . He has a weakness for simple practical jokes , and one of his favorites is to " call up a friend and pretend that he is someone else . This trait pops out most frequently when political matters are going badly , and seems to act as a sort of emotional release . Another habit that strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly from whatever he is doing and going to the piano . He is a composer of sorts and when a new melody comes to him , he drops everything to try it out . He plays by ear and has a good sense of melody . Only one of his compositions has ever been published . It was called Do n't Ask Nothin ' of Me . Frank Hague might have profited by glancing over the lyric before trying to wangle favors out of the new governor . The only income the song ever brought Edison was $11.30 in royalties paid by a restaurant on Times Square which was experimenting with an orchestral accompaniment to its food . The instrument of Edison 's favorite whim is an orange which is kept concealed beneath the lid of the grand piano in his home . When musically smart guests politely ask the governor to play something , he complies with a show of modesty , apologizing for a temperamental weakness which he says makes performance difficult if anyone is seated at his back . The guests move their chairs to the far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its hiding place and begins to roll it slowly over the black keys , while striking an occasional chord with his free hand . Gradually the speed of the orange is increased until the notes are tumbling out wildly and incomprehensibly , with a dissonant and sinister effect . Finally , Edison slows down the orange , strikes a few thunderous closing chords and leans on the keyboard for support , in a state of seeming exhaustion . When the applause dies down , someone usually wants to know the name of the selection . " A modernistic bit by some Russian who was doubtless influenced by Brahms , " Edison says solemnly , and sinks down into a deep chair to gloat over his secret triumph . His fumbling sessions with the keyboard furnish one of his chief escapes from the frustrations of his running battle with Hague . Similarly , he is apt to celebrate a victory over the boss with a joyous crash of chords . One of these triumphs was a bill which he put through the Legislature calling for a compromise on $34,000,000 in overdue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It took a series of long , tedious meetings with a handful of advisers for Edison to work out a practical basis of compromise . At the end of one of these discussions , which were ( Continued on Page 53 ) ( Continued from Page 511 held in the drawing room of Edison 's home in West Orange , the governor got up and walked to the piano . He sat silently for a few seconds , with a dreamy , faraway expression , then began thumping out I 've Been Working on the Railroad . The advisers clustered around and joined in the song . An independent man who lacked an appreciation of Gilbertian humor would risk losing his mind in the Jersey governorship . From the standpoint of executive powers , the governor is a constitutional weakling . The antiquated governmental setup is cockeyed , queer and complicated , and its organizational chart looks like a dish of spaghetti . The state 's business is operated by upwards of eighty boards and commissions with overlapping functions , and many have selfperpetuating memberships . Terms of office are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work does not please the governor can take the attitude that " I 'll he here when he 's gone , " and usually does . Thus a governor soon discovers , if he does not know it beforehand , that it is impossible for him to function as a real chief executive . He is no more than a bystander , a sort of Prisoner of Trenton . Only by the most elaborate process of indirection can the governor get anything done that runs counter to the established political interests . Edison 's struggle to revamp the Department of Highways illustrates what he is up against . This department spends about half the state 's annual budget appropriation , or approximately $50,000,000 , yet owes no accounting to the chief executive . For years its job and contract patronage has been the feedbox of the Hague Republicans , and its commissioner holds office for six years . By a fell mischance , the term of Highway Commissioner E. Donald Sterner ended shortly after Edison took office . Edison refused to reappoint Sterner , but Sterner stayed in office anyway with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after more than a year of tedious jockeying that the governor was able to get an appointee of his own choice in . Like Hague , the Senate was trying to sit Edison out , but he outmaneuvered it . Civil service has since been strengthened in the populous Highway Department , putting a severe crimp in Republican patronage plans , and the contract-letting system is undergoing a revision . The Spoils System This was an important victory for Edison , but there remain many other departments under Republican control , and the old division-of-spoils game , between Hague and the machine Republicans , goes on . The Republicans control the state patronage , while Hague gets the Federal prizes and works Hudson County and Jersey City , its county seat , as a miner works a vein of precious metal . He keeps the Republicans from uniting by throwing favors to individual factions , thus mortgaging their allegiance , and maintains local Democratic leaders on a dole to prevent any one group from becoming strong enough to take away his leadership . It is as sweet an example of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of eighteenth-century England . Hague 's clincher , or Royal Navy , is the tremendous and faithful machine vote of heavily populated Hudson County . Everyone keeps its threat constantly in mind . Thus , Edison faces a hostile Republican Party and , hence , a hostile Legislature , since that body is traditionally Republican ; a hostile Democratic Party  --  Hague  --  and a hostile constitution , of which he once said : " It is sitting alongside the governor 's desk when he reaches the State House in the morning . It blithely takes the governor 's pen away many a time during the day when he would like to issue some order about getting the state 's business done . It has a trick of sitting happily on the knees of senators when they come in to talk about patronage . " There is a fairly strong reform Republican element in Jersey and if , as Edison hopes to do , he is able to influence the choice of his successor , it will be through a coalition with this group . It is a prospect from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plugged away steadily at the need for a revised constitution giving the governor some executive responsibility , and the Legislature has unwillingly drafted a new one . But the lawmakers will , in all likelihood , see to it that the voters never get a chance to vote on it . The present constitution , a patchwork dating back to 1844 , is a politician 's dream . At present , Jersey has a nice new constitution , and it has n't . Edison went into the Jersey governorship under New Deal auspices , but has been strictly paddling his own canoe since he opposed confirmation of a presidential appointee last summer . The appointee was Thomas F. Meaney , whose name President Roosevelt sent to the Senate for a vacant U. S. District judgeship in Jersey , without observing the customary courtesy of consulting the governor . Edison had nothing against Meaney , except that he was a Hague career man , but , feeling strongly about keeping the courts free of political interference , he sent a telegram to the Senate Judiciary Committee in which he stated : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice obtainable from a judge who all his adult life has been part of and obligated to a sordid political machine . . The Senate of the United States has voted that the young men of this country shall go to war to protect our liberties  --  to die for them , if need be . We are under contract to those young men to be worthy of their sacrifice . If we believe in the American way of life enough to send young Americans away to die for it , we must believe in it enough to keep our states  --  our courts  --  clean and free . We must fight here at home for the same things that our young men fight for abroad . We must not permit the sabotage of democracy by petty political tyrants at home . If we think it wrong in Berlin , why should we tolerate it in New Jersey ? " Edison followed up this telegram by testifying before the committee . The senators accorded him a few solemn nods and Hague Congresswoman Mary Norton , who dropped in at the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by denouncing the governor as the most arrant hypocrite that ever walked in Jersey . " When the Meaney episode was over , Hague had a new Federal judge , the President had a Hague promise that Senator Smathers would be re-elected and Edison had his chromium-plated principle in a state of high polish from the rubbing it had got . As things turned out , the President 's act of political expediency backfired with the defeat of Smathers , and the Meaney appointment doubtless played a part in the debacle . For one born the son of a famous man , and with no inheritance of his father 's genius , Charles Edison has done a good job of creating an identity for himself . Thomas Edison was described by a biographer as being motivated by an overdeveloped New England conscience which he kept trying to placate by devoting himself incessantly to achievement . The New England conscience was late in developing in Charles . As a rich man 's son , he followed a familiar pattern . He attended a good preparatory schoolHotchkiss  --  and entered the Massachusetts Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in electrical engineering . After graduation , he held down a fifteen-dollar-aweek job with the Boston Electric Light Company for a year , in deference to a wish of his father 's , and after another year spent in batting about the country , doing odd jobs , he settled down to work in 1914 alongside his father in Thomas A. Edison , Inc. , in West Orange . He was a pleasant , gregarious young man of moderate talents who liked to relax outside of business hours in drinking jousts with the poets and artists of Greenwich Village . One of the souvenirs Edison still retains of his Village days is an old en velope bearing notations in a feminine hand . It is no romantic relic , but a reminder of an afternoon when he was sitting in a Village tearoom , listening to a seminar on the state of the world . A girl named Edna Millay had an attack of inspiration and asked for some paper . Edison dug an envelope from his pocket and handed it to her . She began to scribble something beginning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which later became famous , in a sense prefigured Edison 's administration as governor , which is brief and productive of a lovely light , if nothing else . In 1918 , Edison wound up his Village days by marrying Miss Carolyn Hawkins , of Cambridge , Massachusetts , and pitching in to help his father , who was busy thinking of new scientific weapons for the Navy . By 1926 he was president of Thomas A. Edison , Inc. , which was then a hodgepodge of units making batteries , cement , dictating machines , phonographs , children 's furniture , spark plugs , coils , magnetos , thermostatic controls and other outgrowths of the elder Edison 's lush genius for invention . A reorganization plan conceived by the new president and worked out over a five-year period put the company in a strong position that enabled it to weather the depression which was then brewing . At present , Thomas A. Edison , Inc. , has 5000 employees and a backlog of $75,000,000 worth of contracts for war goods , including ammunition casings and airplane instruments . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run by Arthur Walsh , executive vice-president , who gave up politics after Edison 's campaign for governor . Tracking a Revolution The political education of Charles Edison did not begin until the summer of 1932 , when he was forty-two years old and apparently was set to be a businessman the rest of his life . The depression was approaching its lowest ebb and in West Orange , as in other New York suburban areas , there was dark talk of an impending revolution . Business being slow , Edison and Walsh got into an automobile and toured the country , talking to persons of high and low degree in an effort to learn whether the premonitions of the New York commuters were reflected elsewhere . The farther they got from the Atlantic Coast the less fear of revolution they found , and they decided that the country 's plight was not so hopeless as it seemed to be back East . After a brief holiday in Mexico they stopped off in Chicago to look in on the Democratic National Convention , and what they saw made them unhappy all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another group was pushing Al Smith , and still another was trading votes for Governor Roosevelt . in the crude , time-honored bargaining for the highest office in the land . " Never save the country this way , " Edison remarked to Walsh gloomily . They also attended the Republican Convention and came away with the same feeling . But the optimism of Candidate Roosevelt 's public statements aroused new hope in Edison and he was thrilled by the inaugural address . A Republican voter up to that time , except for two votes cast for Woodrow Wilson , Edison now became a New Deal Democrat . He pasted signs about his factories which stated : " Your President says there is nothing to fear but fear itself . Go ahead and spend money . Buy a new car , get some clothes , go to the movies . " During the bank holiday Edison issued scrip on the company 's credit , which enabled his employees to pay their bills . Hearing about this , Roosevelt called him to Washington and asked him to be a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent men all over the country whose function was to report how things were going in their communities and to recommend new measures for recovery . Asked one day to think up a plan for getting heavy industry rolling again , Edison came up with an idea which soon bloomed into the Federal Housing Administration . He was dumfounded by the brave way in which the New Dealers tossed millions into his idea , but pleased just the same . In the first few years of the New Deal , Edison also served on the National Recovery Administration and the Regional Labor Board . When Roosevelt was reelected in 1936 , he had a feeling that things were going in the right direction , and got ready to go back to Thomas A. Edison , Inc. , again . Frank Hague telephoned one day . They had met a few times at prize fights , and now Hague wanted Edison to run for United States senator . Edison said he did n't want to , but Hague kept telephoning . In an attempt to brush off the offer with finality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner , Hague resumed his sales talk , embellishing his plea with solemn talk about civic duty . Edison protested that his difficulty in hearing would make it impossible for him to follow Senate debate intelligently , and added that , besides , he was accustomed to working in an organization where one member upheld another , and he felt that a senator had to play a lone hand . Hague was incredulous . He pulled his chair up until they were face to face and , as is his custom , emphasized his points by punching an index finger roughly into his host 's breastbone . " Charlie , " he asked , " do you realize I am asking you to run  --  I am  --  me ? " Edison said he did . " But , Charlie , " Hague continued , " I do n't make a practice of asking anyone to run for anything , let along beg them . I am asking you  --  me , Frank Hague ! " Failing to break Edison 's resistance , Hague went to work on Mrs. Edison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was a deep red . " I think you 'll change your mind about this , Charlie , " he said . Edison did n't , and the nomination was given to Smathers , who was elected that fall . After the election , Edison , whose health has never been of the best , went to White Sulphur Springs for a rest , and on his return stopped off in Washington to catch up on capital gossip . While he was there the President summoned him to the White House and proffered the post of Assistant Secretary of the Navy . Edison declined at first , but when Secretary Claude A. Swanson , who was a sick man , added his plea , he accepted and laid aside his plans for returning to private life . It is not improbable that around this time Edison began thinking it might be a good thing if he were someday elected governor of New Jersey . His New Deal jobs had given him an insight into the evils of Hagueism , and the experience had aroused within him an angry spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrated his energies upon bringing about some needed changes in the tradition-encrusted Navy Department . Swanson died in July , 1939 , and Edison was Acting Secretary until the following December , when he was made Secretary . Because of Swanson 's long absences from his desk , Edison was , for all practical purposes , the Secretary from the beginning . He was often in hot water because he refused to accept the dictum of the Navy bureaucracy that the Secretary , as a civilian , should be content with being a figurehead and let the admirals run the Navy . He constantly battled the admirals , and most of the policies for which he fought have been vindicated since in actual warfare . One instance was his lining up with the school of thought which called for emphasis on destroyers , torpedo planes and small torpedo boats as opposed to the " ordnance gang " which put its reliance in heavier and heavier gunnery . The heavy-gunnery school was dominant at the time , and the best victory Edison could manage was a negative one - he succeeded in preventing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junk value of a few thousand dollars apiece . The destroyers he saved from the junk pile formed a substantial part of those which were subsequently turned over to England , to play a strong part in the Battle of the Atlantic . Edison 's hope was to put into our naval warfare something of the high speed and mobility of striking power that the late Knute Rockne had put into football . But most of the admirals stilt held that when the showdown with Japan ultimately came , victory would go to the side with the heaviest guns ; they refused to sacrifice gunnery for speed . The showdown came when Edison attempted to raise the steam pressure and superheat on destroyers which were about to he built . Conservativeminded , the Navy held out for the usual 600 pounds of steam pressure per square inch and 850 degrees of superheat of its existing destroyers . When Edison , pointing out that commercial vessels were being safely operated at 1200 pounds and 950 degrees , insisted on an increase , he was accused of trying to build destroyers which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifications anyway , and our current crop of fast destroyers is the result . So far , none has exploded , and higher pressure and superheat specifications are being built into our newer warships of all classes . To Edison , as an engineer , it was apparent that the Navy had been pursuing a monastic course in its shipbuilding , hewing narrowly to the findings of its own research departments and ignoring those of the elaborate research sections maintained by private firms specializing in metallurgy , oil , coal , machinery , boilers and ship designing . In building ships , it was polishing up and re-using methods it had employed twenty years before , when naval building had enjoyed its last previous boom . The Big Three of the private yards doing Navy construction ? Bethlehem , Newport News and New Xork Shipbuilding Corporation  --  were making war vessels in their entirety , down to the nuts and bolts . Edison put into effect a technique under which orders for boilers , turbines and other parts were farmed out to firms specializing in their manufacture . The yards made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly-line basis . This system saved a good deal of time and assured the Navy of getting the finest products of specialized civilian industry . Early in 1940 Secretary Edison went out on Pacific maneuvers and was dumfounded at the efficiency of Navy dive-bombing . The planes would suddenly roar down out of the sun and release their theoretical bombs and be off before the antiaircraft guns could get into action . When be got back he once more ran up against desk strategists who refused to consider the dive bomber a serious threat to capital ships . Few naval men anywhere , Edison included , fully understood the threat at the time , but Edison at least saw an urgent need for clearing the topsides of warships of such things as the signal-flag racks near the bridge . He saw that a small bomb which otherwise might drop harmlessly could send splinters of the steel flag rods spraying all over the bridge , killing or wounding high officers . After overcoming opposition , he had his topside-clearing program under way , together with extra armoring of exposed decks , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gubernatorial campaign in New Jersey . Despite reverses suffered since then , Edison clings to his belief that Jersey 's prestige can be restored , and he remains passionately devoted to the concept of a strong state government operated for the benefit of the people rather than for the professional politicians . He told the Post recently , " To me , one of the most important needs of our times is for our individual states to stand on their own feet . In the last fifty years the nation has been drifting toward centralization of power in Washington . Invention and Supreme Court decisions have all but erased state lines , and war and economic crises have done the rest . In World War One , national interest made centralization a necessity . After that war , power started to go back to the states slowly , and then came the depression , which swung us back to centralization again . Washington 's hold began to relax once more a few years hack , but then came World War Two , and again we are highly centralized . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the states is , ' The Federal gravy train is going by and we might as well get ours . ' Local pride is gone . " In wartime , any democracy must temporarily function in a totalitarian manner , and Washington today is bigger and more bureaucratic and unwieldy than it has ever been before . After the war , decentralization must start , but who will start it ? Certainly Washington wo n't ; it will be too full of vested bureaucratic interests . Only the states can do the job , and some of them , at least , must be strong and ready . My deepest hope is that New Jersey will be one of the refuges to which democracy can retreat after the war is over . " As to Jersey 's renaissance , he says , " It wo n't be a seven-day wonder . It will he slow and painful . If my successor is weak or vacillating , the fight is lost , regardless of how good his intentions may happen to be . He 's got to be firm enough to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My term is too short for that . I am just doing a job of slum clearance . "
