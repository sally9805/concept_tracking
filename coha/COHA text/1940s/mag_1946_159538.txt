Moscow 's Gorky Street gastronome ( luxury-priced delicatessen ) laid in an extra 57 tons of groceries , 20 tons of candies , five tons of meat . Behind the counters stood additional clerks and cashiers . Outside , three abreast in the softly sifting snow , stood waiting customers in their thousands . <P> Just 18 days after Premier Stalin made his not-yet-fulfilled election promise to abolish rationing and lower food prices , Moscow announced price slashes as high as 60% in foodstuffs . The cuts applied only to the commercial gastronomes , where groceries are sold ( at high mark ups ) to supplement standard ' rations . Bread and cigarets fell 50% , sugar 33% , coffee 40% , meat 20% , vodka and wines 25% . <P> Muscovites flocked to buy . For days the stores were jammed with joking , jostling crowds . One gastronome upped its daily average of 15,000 customers to 60,000 . Here was the first of the concrete blessings of peace . <P> Store directors did themselves proud too with a splurge of fancy displays . Windows and shelves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapped in tinfoil , gaily-colored candy in ribbon-bound boxes . One big window held nothing but a pyramid of Libby 's canned pineapple . But the crowds made mostly for the bread counters .
